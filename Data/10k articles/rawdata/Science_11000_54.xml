'''''13 Things That Don't Make Sense''''' is a non-fiction book by the British writer [[Michael Brooks (science writer)|Michael Brooks]], published in both the UK and the US during 2008.&lt;ref name=PB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LCC/&gt;&lt;ref name=RH/&gt; It became a best-selling paperback in 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The British subtitle is "The Most ''Intriguing'' Scientific Mysteries of Our Time"&lt;ref name=PB/&gt; while the American is "The Most ''Baffling''&amp;nbsp;..." (see image). 

Based on an article Brooks wrote for ''[[New Scientist]]'' in March 2005,&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Michael, [https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18524911.600 13 Things That Don't Make Sense] March 2005, space.newscientist.com&lt;/ref&gt; the book, aimed at the general reader rather than the science community, contains discussion and description of a number of unresolved issues in science. It is a literary effort to discuss some of the inexplicable anomalies that after centuries science still cannot completely comprehend.&lt;ref name=RH&gt;Brooks, Michael, [http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/9780385520683.html 13 Things That Don't Make Sense], August 2008, Randon House Inc., {{ISBN|978-0-385-52068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelbrooks.org Michael Brooks] official Website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chapter 1==

The Missing Universe. This deals with [[astronomy]] and [[theoretical physics]] and the [[ultimate fate of the universe]], in particular the search for understanding of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] and includes discussion of: the work of astronomers [[Vesto Slipher]] and then [[Edwin Hubble]] in demonstrating the universe is expanding; [[Vera Rubin]]'s investigation of [[galaxy rotation curve]]s that suggest something other than gravity is preventing galaxies from spinning apart, which led to the revival of unobserved "dark matter" theory; experimental efforts to discover dark matter, including the search for the hypothetical [[neutralino]] and other [[weakly interacting massive particles]]); the study of [[supernova]]e at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] and [[Harvard University]] (under [[Robert Kirshner]]) that point to an [[accelerating universe]] powered by "dark energy" possibly [[Vacuum energy]]; and finally the assertion that the proposed [[modified Newtonian dynamics]] hypothesis and the accelerating universe disproves the dark matter theory.

==Chapter 2==

The [[Pioneer Anomaly]]. This discusses the ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' and ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' space probes, which appear to be veering off course and drifting towards the sun. There is growing speculation as to whether this phenomenon can be explained by a yet-undetermined fault in the rockets' systems or whether this obliges us to rethink theories of physics such as gravity. The lead investigator into the progress of the rockets is physicist [[Slava Turyshev]] of the [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in California who is analysing the data of the rockets' launch and progress and "reflying" the missions as computer simulations to try to find a solution to the mystery.

However, in 2012, after the book was published, Turyshev was able to give an [[Pioneer_anomaly#Explanation:_thermal_recoil_force|explanation]] to the Pioneer Anomaly.

==Chapter 3==

[[Fine-structure constant#Is the fine structure constant truly constant.3F|Varying Constants]]. This chapter discusses the reliability of some [[physical constant]]s, quantities or values that are held to be always fixed. One of these, the [[Fine-structure constant]], which calculates the behaviour and amount of energy transmitted in subatomic interactions from light reflection and refraction to nuclear fusion, has been called into question by physicist John Webb of the [[University of New South Wales]] who may have identified differences in the behaviour of light from [[quasar]]s and light sources today. According to Webb's observations quasar light appears to refract different shades of colour from light waves emitted today. Brooks also discusses the [[Oklo]] [[natural nuclear fission reactor]], in which the natural conditions in caves in [[Gabon]] 2 billion years ago caused the [[uranium]] there to react. It may be that the amount of energy released was different from today. Both sets of data are subject to ongoing investigation and debate but, Brooks suggests, may indicate that the behaviour of matter and energy can vary radically and essentially as the conditions of the universe changes through time.

==Chapter 4==

[[Cold Fusion]]. A review of efforts to create nuclear energy at room temperature using hydrogen that is embedded in a metal crystal lattice. Theoretically, this should not happen, because nuclear fusion requires a huge [[activation energy]] to get it started. The effect was first reported by chemists [[Martin Fleischmann]] and [[Stanley Pons]] in 1989, but attempts to reproduce it over the ensuing months were mostly unsuccessful. Cold fusion research was discredited, and articles on the subject became difficult to publish. But according to the book, a scattering of scientists around the world continue to report positive results, with multiple, independent verifications, making the evidence difficult to deny.{{dubious|date=February 2016}}&lt;!-- If this were the case, mainstream science would be very interested. Fixed to be "according to the book". The argument is for fuzzy various evidence. hard to prove or disprove!--&gt;

==Chapter 5==

[[Life]]. This chapters describes efforts to define life and how it emerged from inanimate matter ([[Abiogenesis]]) and even recreate [[Artificial life]] including: the [[Miller–Urey experiment]] by chemists [[Stanley Miller]] and [[Harold Urey]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1953 to spark life into a mixture of chemicals by using an electrical charge; [[Steen Rasmussen]]'s work at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] to implant primitive DNA, [[Peptide nucleic acid]], into soap molecules and heat them up; and the work of the [[Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter]] at the [[University of California]].

==Chapter 6==

Viking. A discussion of the experiments by engineer [[Gilbert Levin]] to search for life on [[Mars]] in the 1970s as part of the [[Viking program]]. Levin's Labeled Release experiment appeared to conclusively show that life does exist on Mars, but as his results were not supported by the other three [[Viking biological experiments]], they were called into question and eventually not accepted by [[NASA]], which instead hypothesized that the gases observed being generated may not have been a product of living metabolism but of a chemical reaction of [[hydrogen peroxide]]. Brooks goes into detail on some of Levin's other experiments and also describes how NASA's subsequent missions to Mars have focused on the geology and climate of the planet rather than looking for life on the planet.  (Several missions are searching for water and geological conditions which could support [[life on Mars]] currently or in the past.)

==Chapter 7==

The [[Wow! Signal]]. Brooks discusses whether or not the signal spotted by astronomer [[Jerry R. Ehman]] at the ''[[The Big Ear|Big Ear]]'' [[radio telescope]] of [[Ohio State University]] in 1977 was a genuine indication of intelligent life in outer space.  This was a remarkably clear signal and Big Ear was the largest and longest running SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) radio-telescope project in the world. Brooks goes on to discuss the abandonment of [[NASA]]'s [[Microwave Observing Program]] after government funding was stopped by the efforts of senator [[Richard Bryan]] of [[Nevada]]. There is no public funding for similar observations today while the [[SETI Institute]], which continues NASA's work is funded by private donation, as are a number of other initiatives (see [[SETI]]).

==Chapter 8==

A Giant Virus. Brooks describes the huge and highly resistant [[Mimivirus]] found in [[Bradford]], England in 1992 and whether this challenges the traditional view of [[virus]]es being inanimate chemicals rather than living things. Mimivirus is not only much larger than most viruses but it also has a much more complex genetic structure. The discovery of Mimivirus has given weight to the theories of microbiologist Philip Bell and others that viral infection was indeed the reason for the emergence from primitive life forms of complex cell structures based on a [[cell nucleus]]. (See [[viral eukaryogenesis]].) Study of the behaviour and structure of viruses is ongoing.

==Chapter 9==

[[Death]]. Beginning with the example of [[Blanding's turtle]] and certain species of fish, amphibians and reptiles that do not age as they grow older, Brooks discusses theories and research into the [[evolution of ageing]]. These include the studies of [[Peter Medawar]] and [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in the 1950s and Thomas Johnson, David Friedman and [[Cynthia Kenyon]] in the 1980s claiming that [[senescence|ageing]] is a genetic process that has evolved as organism select genes that help them to grow and reproduce over ones that help them to thrive in later life. Brooks also talks about [[Leonard Hayflick]], as well as others, who have observed that cells in culture will at a fixed point in time stop reproducing and die as their DNA eventually becomes corrupted by continuous division, a mechanical process at cell level rather than part of a creature's genetic code.

==Chapter 10==

[[Sex]]. This chapter is a discussion of theories of the [[evolution of sexual reproduction]]. The common-sense explanation is that although [[asexual reproduction]] is much easier and more efficient for an organism it is less common than sexual reproduction because having two parents allows species to adapt and evolve more easily to survive in changing environments. Brooks discusses efforts to prove this by laboratory experiment and goes on to discuss alternative theories including the work of [[Joan Roughgarden]] of [[Stanford University]] who proposes that sexual reproduction, rather than being driven by [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[sexual selection]] in individuals is a mechanism for the survival of social groupings, which most higher species depend on for survival.

==Chapter 11==

[[Free Will]]. Discusses the experimental investigations into the [[Neuroscience of free will]] by [[Benjamin Libet]] of the [[University of California, San Francisco]] and others, which show that the brain seems to commit to certain decisions before the person becomes aware of having made them and discusses the implications of these findings on our conception of free will.

==Chapter 12==

The [[Placebo|Placebo Effect]]. This is a discussion of the role of the placebo in modern medicine, including examples such as [[Diazepam]], which, Brooks claims, in some situations appears to work only if the patient knows they are taking it. Brooks describes research into prescription behaviour which appears to show that use of placebos is commonplace. He describes the paper by [[Asbjørn Hrobjartsson]] and [[Peter C. Gøtzsche]] in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] that challenges use of placebos entirely, and the work of others towards an understanding of the mechanism of the effect.

==Chapter 13==

[[Homeopathy]]. Brooks discusses the work of researcher [[Madeleine Ennis]] involving a homeopathic solution which once contained [[histamine]] but was diluted to the point where no histamine remained. Brooks conjectures that the results might be explained by some [[water memory|previously unknown property of water]]. Brooks supports the investigation of documented anomalies even though he is critical of the practice of homeopathy in general, as are many of the scientists he cites, such as [[Martin Chaplin]] of [[South Bank University]].

'''2.02''' is the designation of the fourth built&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.k26.com/buran/Future/2.02/space_buran_2_02.html|title=Space Buran 2.02|first=k26 Design|last=Group|website=www.k26.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet/Russian space shuttle orbiter to be produced as part of the [[Buran program]]. It carried the  [[GRAU]] index [[serial number]] "'''11F35 K4'''" and is (depending on the source) also known as "'''OK-2K2'''", "'''Orbiter K4'''", "'''OK 2.02'''" or "'''Shuttle 2.02'''". It was never officially named.

In 1993, when the Buran program was stopped, orbiter 2.02 was in an early stage of construction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buran-energia.com/bourane-buran/bourane-modele-202.php|title=Buran Built models OK-2.02|website=www.buran-energia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (10-20 percent). The incomplete 2.02 was later partially dismantled at its construction site and moved to the outside of the Tushino Machine Building Plant, near Moscow.

Some of the tiles from orbiter 2.02 were sold and auctioned on the [[Internet]].

'''Astronomical algorithms''' are the [[algorithm]]s used to calculate [[ephemeris|ephemerides]], [[calendar]]s, and positions (as in [[celestial navigation]] or [[satellite navigation]]). Examples of large and complex [[astronomy|astronomical]] algorithms are those used to calculate the position of the [[Moon]].  A simple example is the [[Julian day#Calculation|calculation of the Julian day]].

[[Numerical model of solar system]] discusses a generalized approach to local astronomical modeling. The ''[[variations séculaires des orbites planétaires]]'' describes an often used model.

'''Astrovirtel''' ('''Accessing Astronomical Archives as Virtual Telescopes''', [[List of observatory codes|obs. code]]: [[IAU code#I03|I03]]) is a data archive used as virtual astronomical observatory. The project was funded from 2000 until 2003 and supported by the European Commission's Access to Research Infrastructures action of the Improving Human Potential Programme and managed by the [[Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility]] (ST-ECF) on behalf of [[European Space Agency]] and [[European Southern Observatory]] (ESO). 

Its aim was to enhance the scientific return of the ST-ECF/ESO Archive, allowing European users to exploit the archive as a virtual telescope, retrieving and analyzing large quantities of data with the assistance of the archive operators and personnel. The Astrovirtel Selection Panel selected up to six proposals per year. 

Astrovirtel was an initial step towards a proper virtual observatory, such as the [[European Virtual Observatory]].

'''Auguste Faguet''' (1841–1886) was a noted 19th-century French botanical illustrator, well known for his contributions to major botanical works.

Auguste Faguet produced fine botanical [[wood engraving]]s to illustrate the works of [[Henri Ernest Baillon]]. For the ''"Dictionnaire de botanique"'', which appeared in 34 fascicles between 1876 and 1892, he produced 32 [[chromolithograph]]ed plates, published with each fascicle.

Faguet's drawings involve accurate perspective, his skill creating persuasive depth. Faguet's other work for Baillon included ''"Recherches des coniferes"'' of 1860, 1186 woodcuts in ''"Traite de botanique medicale phanerogamique"'' 1883-1884, 370 woodcuts in ''"Traite de botanique medicale cryptogamique"'' of 1889, ''"Loganiacees"'' of 1856 and ''"Bignoniacees"'' of 1864. Henri Faguet also did illustrations for [[Edouard Bureau]]'s ''"Monographie des bignoniacee"'' of 1864, [[Alfred Grandidier]]'s ''"Histoire physique, naturelle et politique de Madagascar"'' of 1875 and his ''"Histoire naturelle des plantes"'' that appeared between 1886 and 1903. Faguet also collaborated on a periodical, ''"L'Horticulteur Francais"'', between 1851 and 1872. His excellent woodcuts were overtaken by the renewed use of metal printing plates for botanical illustrations. Thiebault and Faguet illustrated Henri Baillon's ''"Histoire des plantes"'' (1866-1895). Faguet supplied engraved text figures for [[Georges Octave Dujardin-Beaumetz]] (1833-1895) &amp; [[Egasse]]'s ''"Les plantes medicinales indigenes ex exotique"'' of 1889, and contributed to ''"The Floral Register"'', a periodical which appeared between 1825 and 1851.

'''Autonomous Telepresence''' (or AT) is a term coined by Marque Cornblatt to describe an emerging field of study that combines [[robotics]], [[social networking]] and human interaction. These elements together enable an entirely new and unique form of two-way communication - remotely operated face-to-face video chat. Using off-the-shelf components, Gomi and found objects, AT was first developed and built by Cornblatt in 1993 in the Sparky series of rovers (also known as the Self Portrait Artifact - Roving Chassis series).

Combining the real-time interaction commonly associated with web-based [[video chat]] with the independence of a remotely operated vehicle, AT has become a novel method for human interaction, helping connect people in schools, museums, corporate environment and events.

By the late 1990s the Sparky series had grown to include a wide range of technologies to enable [[face-to-face interaction]], These include the development of unique software and code, as well as the inclusion of Internet, Wi-Fi, and other technologies.  AT was featured at the 2007 [[Interactive Television of Tomorrow]] show, as well as the [[American Film Institute]] Digital Content Festival the same year.  AT and Sparky were recently showcased on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]'s [[Modern Marvels]] program as the future of the telephone.

The resulting [[disulfide]]s are less odorous and usually very viscous, and are usually removed from the lower-boiling [[fractional distillation|fractions]] and left in the [[heavy fuel oil]] fraction.

Copper sweetening introduces trace amount of [[copper]] into the resulting products, which tends to have detrimental effects as it leads to formation of [[wikt:gummy|gummy]] residues. Other sources of copper include contact with refinery parts made of copper and copper alloys. Copper is one of the most active instability promoters, and concentrations as low as 0.1 ppm can have marked negative effect. To combat these, [[metal deactivator]]s are added to some fuels.

'''Cornelis Jacobszoon Drebbel'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/ukdrebbel/ |title=Drebbel's website www.drebbel.net |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-nl|kɔrˈneːlɪs ˈjaːkɔpsoːn ˈdrɛbəl}}; 1572 – 7 November 1633) was a Dutch engineer and inventor. He was the builder of the first navigable [[submarine]] in 1620 and an innovator who contributed to the development of [[measurement]] and [[control systems]], [[optics]] and [[chemistry]].

==Biography==
Cornelis Drebbel was born in [[Alkmaar]], [[Holland]] in an [[Anabaptist]] family in 1572. After some years at the Latin school in Alkmaar, around 1587, he attended the Academy in [[Haarlem]], also located in North-Holland. Teachers at the Academy were [[Hendrik Goltzius]], engraver, painter, alchemist and humanist, [[Karel van Mander]], painter, writer, humanist and [[Cornelis Corneliszoon]] of Haarlem. Drebbel became a skilled engraver on copperplate and also took an interest in [[alchemy]].

In 1595 he married Sophia Jansdochter Goltzius, younger sister of Hendrick, and settled at Alkmaar. They had at least six children, of whom four survived. Drebbel worked initially as a painter, engraver and cartographer. But he was in constant need of money because of the prodigal lifestyle of his wife. In 1598 he obtained a patent for a water-supply system and a sort of perpetual clockwork. In 1600, Drebbel was in [[Middelburg]] where he built a fountain at the Noorderpoort. In that spectacle making center he may have picked up knowledge in the art of lens grinding&lt;ref&gt;Gerrit Tierie, Cornelis Drebbel (1572-1633), H. J. Paris - 1932, page 47 [http://www.drebbel.net/Tierie.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and later would construct a [[magic lantern]] and a [[camera obscura]].

Around 1604 the Drebbel family moved to England, probably at the invitation of the new king, [[James I of England]] (VI of Scotland). He was accommodated at [[Eltham Palace]]. Drebbel worked there at the masques, that were performed by and for the court. He was attached to the court of young Renaissance crown-prince Henry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drebbel.net/Tierie.pdf|title=Tierie, Gerrit. Cornelis Drebbel. Amsterdam: HJ Paris, 1932.|accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He astonished the court with his inventions (a [[perpetual motion|perpetuum mobile]], automatic and hydraulic organs) and his optical instruments.
[[File:Drebbel-Clock.jpg|thumb|"Perpetuum mobile" clock by Drebbel]]
His fame circulated through the courts of Europe. In  October 1610 Drebbel and his family moved to [[Prague]] on invitation of Emperor [[Rudolf II]], who was  preoccupied with the arts, alchemy and occult sciences. Here again Drebbel demonstrated his inventions. When in 1611 Rudolf II was stripped of all effective power by his younger brother [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Matthias]], Drebbel was imprisoned for about a year. After Rudolf's death in 1612, Drebbel was set free and went back to London. Unfortunately his patron prince Henry had also died and Drebbel was in financial trouble.

With his glass-grinding machine he manufactured optical instruments and compound microscopes with two convex lenses, for which there was a constant demand. In 1622 [[Constantijn Huygens]] stayed as a diplomat for more than one year in England. It is quite possible that he learned the art of glass grinding at this time from Drebbel, and that he passed this knowledge to his second son [[Christiaan Huygens]], who became a prominent Dutch mathematician and scientist. The English natural philosopher [[Robert Hooke]] may have learned the art of glass grinding from his acquaintance Johannes Sibertus Kuffler, the son-in-law of Drebbel.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Cornelis Drebbel&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of his life, in 1633, Drebbel was involved in a plan to drain the Fens around Cambridge, while living in near-poverty running an ale house in England.  He died in [[London]].&lt;ref name="will"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drebbel.net/Drebles%20will%20Memorand%20that%20Cornelius%20Drebbel.pdf|format=PDF|title=Drebbel's will from 7 November 1633: Memorand that Cornelius |website=Drebbel.net|accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with traditional [[Mennonite]] practice, Drebbel's estate was split between his four living children at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drebbel.net/Drebles%20will%20Memorand%20that%20Cornelius%20Drebbel.pdf|format=PDF|title="My following children viz. John Dreble, Jacob Dreble, Cathryne Kiffler and Ann Kiffler"|website=Drebbel.net|accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
The Edison of his era, Drebbel was an empirical researcher and innovator. His constructions and innovations cover measurement and control technology, pneumatics, optics, chemistry, hydraulics and pyrotechnics. Along with Staten General he registered several patents. He also wrote essays about his experiments with air pressure and made beautiful engravings; including The Seven Liberal Arts on a map of the city of Alkmaar. He was involved in making theater props, moving statues and in plans to build a new theater in London. He worked on producing torpedoes, [[naval mine]]s, detonators with that used glass [[Prince Rupert's Drop|Batavian tears]], and worked on  [[fulminating gold]] (''aurum fulminans'') as an explosive.

He was known for his Perpetuum Mobile, built an incubator for eggs and a portable stove/oven with an optimal use of fuel, able to keep the heat on a constant temperature by means of a regulator/thermostat. He designed a solar energy system for London (perpetual fire), demonstrated air-conditioning, made lightning and thunder ‘on command’, and developed fountains and a fresh water supply for the city of Middelburg. He was involved in the draining of the moors around Cambridge (the Fens), developed a predecessors of the barometer and thermometer, and a harpsichords that played on solar energy.

===Chemistry===
Drebbel's most famous written work was ''Een kort Tractaet van de Natuere der Elementen''&lt;ref name="Tractaet"&gt;[http://www.drebbel.net/Tractaet.pdf Een Kort Tractaet van de Natuere der Elementen] C. Drebbel, 1621&lt;/ref&gt; (A short treatise of the nature of the elements) ([[Haarlem]], 1621). He was also involved in the invention of [[mercury fulminate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://131.104.156.23/Lectures/CHEM_462/462_chapter_1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040707185921/http://131.104.156.23/Lectures/CHEM_462/462_chapter_1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-07-07 |title=Advanced Main Group Chemistry (I) – Rings, Chains, Clusters |publisher=131.104.156.23 |date=2000-01-27 |accessdate=2010-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also discovered that  mixtures of “spiritus vini” with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[silver]] in “[[aqua fortis]]” could explode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattlecentral.edu/faculty/dwick/fulminate.pdf F. Kurzer: “Fulminic Acid in the History of Organic Chemistry“, J. Chem. Educ. 2000, 77, 851]&lt;/ref&gt;

Drebbel invented a chicken [[wikt:incubator|incubator]] and a [[mercury (element)|mercury]] [[thermostat]] which automatically kept it stable at a constant temperature;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drebbel.net/Tierie.pdf|title=Tierie, Gerrit. Cornelis Drebbel. Amsterdam: HJ Paris, 1932.|accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first recorded [[feedback|feedback-controlled]] devices. He also developed and demonstrated a working [[air conditioning]] system. The invention of a working [[thermometer]] is also credited to Drebbel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/ncps:@field(DOCID+@lit(ABF2204-0005-51)):: |title=Scientific American. / Volume 5, Issue 50, August 31, 1850 |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scarlet dye====
The story goes that, while making a coloured liquid for a [[thermometer]] Cornelis dropped a flask of [[aqua regia]] on a [[tin]] window sill, and discovered that [[tin(II) chloride|stannous chloride]] makes the colour of [[carmine]] much brighter and more durable. Although Cornelis did not make much money from his work, his daughters Anna and Catharina and his sons-in-law Abraham and [[Johannes Sibertus Kuffler]] set up a very successful dye works.
One was set up in 1643 in [[Bow, London]], and the resulting colour was called [[bow dye]].&lt;ref&gt;A history of inventions and discoveries, Volume 2,Johann Beckmann,1817&lt;/ref&gt;
The recipe for "colour Kufflerianus" was kept a family secret, and the new bright red colour was very popular in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Butler Greenfield,A Perfect Red,Harper Collins 2005,{{ISBN|0-06-052275-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/p/3962.php |title=Johannes Siberius Kuffler (Pepys' Diary) |website=Pepysdiary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optics===

Develops an automatic precision lens-grinding machine, builds improved telescopes, constructs the first microscope ('lunette de Dreubells'), [[camera obscura]],  laterna magica, manufactures [[Prince Rupert's Drop|Dutch or Batavian tears]]

====Compound microscope====

One of the optical devices some historians believe Drebbel invented when he was working for the Duke of Buckingham was the [[Optical microscope#Compound microscope|compound microscope]]. The device appeared in Europe around 1620 with the earliest account being Dutch Ambassador [[Willem Boreel]]'s 1619 visit to London where he saw a compound microscope in Drebbel's possession, described as an instrument about eighteen inches long, two inches in diameter, and supported on 3 brass dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Ch'en, [[Nicholas Tarling]], Studies in the Social History of China and South-East Asia: Essays in Memory of Victor Purcell, Cambridge University Press, Jun 10, 2010, page 215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kCSdiZcsWNsC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22Cornelis+Drebbel%22+microscope#PPP1,M1 |title=The Microscope – Its Design, Construction and Applications by F.

Several of his contemporaries, including [[Christiaan Huygens]], credited the invention of the compound microscope to Drebbel. The invention has many counter claims including Dutch spectacle-maker Johannes Zachariassen's claim that Drebbel stole the idea from him and his father, [[Zacharias Jansen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Shmaefsky, Biotechnology 101 - 2006, page 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cr4_UJkBwYYC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=%22Cornelis+Drebbel%22+microscope#PPP1,M1 |title=Under the microscope by William J.

In 1624 Galileo saw Drebbel's design for a microscope in [[Rome]] and created an improved version of it to send to [[Federico Cesi]], founder of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]], who used it to illustrate ''Apiarum'', his book about bees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nabt.org/websites/institution/File/pdfs/american_biology_teacher/2005/067-07-0392.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Dawn of Microscopy, by David Bardell|publisher=[[National Association of Biology Teachers]]|accessdate=2016-01-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002953/https://www.nabt.org/websites/institution/File/pdfs/american_biology_teacher/2005/067-07-0392.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Drebbel - geograph.org.uk - 508179.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Reconstruction of the Drebbel, [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond upon Thames]]. In 2002, the British boatbuilder [[Mark Edwards (boatbuilder)|Mark Edwards]] built a wooden submarine based on the original version by Drebbel. It was shown in the BBC TV programme ''Building the Impossible'' in 2002.]]
He also built the first navigable [[submarine]] in 1620 while working for the English [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name=davis1955&gt;{{cite book |author=Davis, RH |title=Deep Diving and Submarine Operations |year=1955 |edition=6th |publisher=[[Siebe Gorman|Siebe Gorman &amp; Company Ltd]] |location=Tolworth, Surbiton, Surrey |page=693 |authorlink=Robert Davis (inventor) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=acott&gt;{{cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=A brief history of diving and decompression illness. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6004 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He manufactured a steerable submarine with a leather-covered wooden frame. Between 1620 and 1624 Drebbel successfully built and tested two more submarines, each one bigger than the last. The final (third) model had 6 [[oar]]s and could carry 16 passengers. This model was demonstrated to [[King James I]] in person and several thousand Londoners. The submarine stayed submerged for three hours and could travel from [[Westminster]] to [[Greenwich]] and back, cruising at a depth between 12 and 15 feet (4 to 5 metres). Drebbel even  took James in this submarine on a test dive beneath the Thames, making James I the first monarch to travel underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/OutPut/Page1673.asp |title=King James VI and I |publisher=Royal.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023633/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page1673.asp |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This submarine was tested many times in the [[River Thames|Thames]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YFZbAAAAQAAJ Kronyk der stad Alkmaer, Cornelis van der Woude - E. J. Visscher, 1725, p.191-192]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} but it couldn't attract enough enthusiasm from the Admiralty and was never used in combat.

&lt;!-- (Speculation: To re-oxygenate the air inside one or more of these submarines, it is possible he generated [[oxygen]] by heating ''nitre'' ([[potassium nitrate]] or [[sodium nitrate]]) in a metal pan to make it emit oxygen. That would also turn the nitrate into sodium or potassium [[oxide]] or [[hydroxide]], which would tend to absorb carbon dioxide from the air around. That may explain how Drebbel's men were not affected by [[hypercapnia|carbon dioxide build-up]] as much as would be expected. If so, he accidentally made a crude [[rebreather]] nearly three centuries before [[Rebreather#History of rebreathers|Fluess and Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Drebbel had been taught by the alchemist [[Michał Sędziwój|Michael Sendivogius]] (1566–1636) (perhaps when both were at the court of Rudolf II) that warming ''nitre'' produced oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sendivogius, The Alchemical Letters of Michael Sendivogius to the Rosicrucian Society, Holmes Pub Group Llc, ISBN 1-55818-404-X&lt;/ref&gt; The most reliable source suggesting the use of oxygen is a note by [[Robert Boyle]]. In 1662 Boyle wrote that he had spoken with ''an excellent mathematician'', who was still alive and had been on the submarine, who said that Drebbel had a ''chemical liquor'' that would replace that ''quintessence of air'' that was able to ''cherish the vital flame residing in the heart''.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} --&gt;More recently it has been suggested that the contemporary accounts of the craft contained significant elements of exaggeration and it was at most a [[Semi-submarine|semi-submersible]] which was able to travel down the Thames by the force of the current.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;{{cite book |title=Disasters of the Deep A Comprehensive Survey of Submarine Accidents &amp; Disasters |last=Gray |first=Edwyn |authorlink=Edwyn Gray |year=2003|publisher=Leo Cooper|isbn=0-85052-987-5 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
Cornelis Drebbel has been honoured on postage stamps issued by the postal services of both [[Mali]] and the [[Netherlands]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/postage_stamps |title=Postage Stamps |publisher=GAMEO |date= |accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portrayal of Cornelis Drebbel and his submarine can be briefly seen in the film ''[[The Four Musketeers (1974 film)|The Four Musketeers]]'' (1974). A small leatherclad submersible surfaces off the coast of England, and the top opens clamshell-wise revealing Cornelis Drebbel and the [[Duke of Buckingham]].

Drebbel was honoured in an episode of the cartoon ''[[Sealab 2021]]'' during a submarine rescue of workers on a research station in the [[Arctic]]. A German [[U-boat]] captain fired a pistol in celebration at the mention of Drebbel, to shouts of, "Sieg Heil! Cornelis Drebbel!" Also, on the Sealab 2021 Season 3 DVD, Cornelis Drebbel has two DVD commentaries devoted to the story of his life.

In the Dutch Eighty Years' War comic [[Gilles de Geus]], Drebbel is a supporting character to the warhero Gilles. He is drawn as a crazy inventor, similar to [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] in the [[James Bond|James Bond series]]. His submarine plays a role in the comic.

Richard SantaColoma has speculated that the [[Voynich Manuscript]] may be connected to Drebbel, initially suggesting it was Drebbel's cipher notebook on microscopy and alchemy, and then later hypothesising it is a fictional "tie in" to [[Francis Bacon]]'s utopian novel ''[[New Atlantis]]'' in which some Drebbel-related items (submarine, perpetual clock) are said to appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santa-coloma.net/voynich_drebbel/voynich.html |title=New Atlantis Voynich Theory |author=H.

== Namesake ==
A small [[lunar crater]] has been [[Drebbel (crater)|named after him]]. The street "Cornelis Drebbelweg" in [[Delft]], the Netherlands has been named after him.

'''''Database System Concepts''''', by [[Abraham Silberschatz]] and [[Hank Korth]],
is a classic{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} textbook on [[database system|database systems]].
It is often called the sailboat book, because its first edition had on its cover a number of
sailboats, labelled with the names of various [[database model|database models]].
The boats are sailing from a desert island towards a tropical island,
while the wind pushes them away and prevents their arrival.

The book is currently in its sixth edition.
The third edition added S. Sudrashan as an author.

Demographics can be called a science and demographic marketers can be called scientists. A demographic is used to describe individuals who are from a particular area. It can also be used to describe individuals who would rely on purchasing a particular product or service. Using demographics, a [[marketing manager]] can try to grasp what certain people think and what they are willing to buy.

By understanding how various characteristics of the population reflect their tastes, demographic marketers get an idea of the probability of the sales returns of a launched product in a given area. For any type of business, knowing who the [[customers]] are most likely to be through [[demographic analysis]] will make it easier to market effectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1020">'''Echelon cracks''' are a related series of cracks in a planar structure and are a response to shearing forces in the plane of the surface. Such cracks are typically found in asphalt roadways due to [[aseismic creep]] and in other planar structures such as walls and building facades due to non-uniform settlement into soft soil.

Such cracks in a uniform surface will form at a uniform angle to the general direction of shear and will progress with more-or-less uniform spacing, length, and offset, thus forming the echelon.

On a larger scale, a zone between offset [[strike slip fault]]s may have minor ''en echelon'' fault strands that accommodate the shearing motion induced in the region. On rock undergoing these shearing stresses [[en echelon veins]] may occur as [[Fracture (geology)|fracture]] fillings.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, G. H., and Reynolds, S.

An '''epistemic community''' is a transnational [[business networking|network]] of knowledge-based [[experts]] who help decision-makers to define the problems they face, identify various [[policy]] solutions and assess the policy outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Jennifer Y.

Haas]]. He describes them as &lt;blockquote&gt;
"...a network of professionals with recognised expertise and competence in a particular domain and an authoritative claim to policy relevant knowledge within that domain or issue-area."&lt;ref name="haas 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas |first=Peter M.|authorlink=Peter M.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although the members of an epistemic community may originate from a variety of academic or professional backgrounds, they are linked by a set of unifying characteristics&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; for the promotion of collective amelioration and not collective gain.&lt;ref name="sebenius 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sebenius|first=James K.|title=Challenging conventional explanations of international cooperation: negotiation analysis and the case of epistemic communities|journal=[[International Organization]]|volume=46|issue=1|pages=323–365|publisher =[[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] |doi=10.1017/S0020818300001521|date= Winter 1992|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0020818300001521 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is termed their "normative component".&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; In the big picture, epistemic communities are socio-psychological entities that create and justify knowledge. Such communities can constitute of only two persons and yet gain an important role in building knowledge on any specific subject. Miika Vähämaa has recently suggested that epistemic communities consist of persons being able to understand, discuss and gain self-esteem concerning the matters being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Vähämaa | first = Miika | title = Groups as epistemic communities: social forces and affect as antecedents to knowledge | journal = [[Social Epistemology (journal)|Social Epistemology]] | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–20 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/02691728.2012.760660 | date = January 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02691728.2012.760660 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

Some theorists argue that an epistemic community may consist of those who accept one version of a story, or one version of validating a story. [[Michel Foucault]] referred more elaborately to [[Mathesis (philosophy)|mathesis]] as a rigorous [[episteme]] suitable for enabling cohesion of a [[discourse]] and thus uniting a community of its followers.  In [[philosophy of science]] and [[systems science]] the process of forming a self-maintaining epistemic community is sometimes called a [[mindset]].  In [[politics]], a tendency or [[Political factions|faction]] is usually described in very similar terms.

Most researchers carefully distinguish between epistemic forms of community and "real" or "bodily" [[community]] which consists of people sharing [[risk]], especially bodily risk.

It is also problematic to draw the line between modern ideas and more ancient ones, for example, [[Joseph Campbell]]'s concept of [[mythology|myth]] from [[cultural anthropology]], and [[Carl Jung]]'s concept of [[archetype]] in [[psychology]]. Some consider forming an epistemic community a deep human need, and ultimately a mythical or even religious obligation. Among these very notably are [[E. O. Wilson]], as well as [[Ellen Dissanayake]], an American historian of [[aesthetics]] who famously argued that almost all of our broadly shared [[conceptual metaphor]]s centre on one basic idea of safety: that of "home".

From this view, an epistemic community may be seen as a group of people who do not have any specific history together, but search for a common idea of home as if forming an [[intentional community]].  For example, an epistemic community can be found in a network of professionals from a wide variety of disciplines and backgrounds.&lt;ref name="reinalda184"&gt;{{citation | last = Verdun | first = Amy | contribution = The increase influence of EU monetary institutions in determining national policies: a transnational monetary elite at work | editor-last1 = Reinalda | editor-first1 = Bob | editor-last2 = Verbeek | editor-first2 = Bertjan | title = Autonomous policy making by international organizations | page = 184 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1998 | series = Routledge/ECPR Studies in European Political Science Series | isbn = 9780415164863 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed in Peter M. Haas's definitive text,&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; an epistemic community is made up of a diverse range of academic and professional experts, who are allied on the basis of four unifying characteristics:

# a ''shared set of normative and principled beliefs'' which provide a value-based rationale for the social action of community members; 
# ''shared causal beliefs'' which are derived from their analysis of practices leading or contributing to a central set of problems in their domain and which then serve as the basis for elucidating the multiple linkages between possible policy actions and desired outcomes;
# ''shared notions of validity'', i.e. intersubjective, internally defined criteria for weighing and validating knowledge in the domain of their expertise; and
# a ''common policy enterprise'', or a set of common practices associated with a set of problems to which their professional competence is directed, presumably out of the conviction that human welfare will be enhanced as a consequence.

Thus, when viewed as an epistemic community, the overall enterprise of the expert members emerges as the product of a combination of shared beliefs and more subtle conformity pressures, rather than a direct drive for concurrence (Michael J. Mazarr). Epistemic communities also have a "normative component" meaning the end goal is always for the betterment of society, rather than self gain of the community itself (Peter M. Haas).

In international relations and political science, an [[Epistemic community (international relations)|epistemic community]] can also be referred to as a global network of knowledge-based professionals in scientific and technological areas that often affect policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Morin, Jean-Frédéric, Louafi, Sélim, Orsini Amandine and Mohamed Oubenal, Boundary organizations in regime complexes: a social network profile of IPBES, Journal of International Relations and Development, 2016, http://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_et_al._2016_ipbes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Environmental Governance==
The global environmental agenda is increasing in [[complexity]] and [[interconnectivity|interconnectedness]].&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; Often environmental policymakers do not understand the technical aspects of the issues they are regulating.&lt;ref name="haas 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas|first=Peter M.|authorlink=Peter M. Haas|title=Obtaining international environmental protection through epistemic consensus|journal=Millennium Journal of International Studies|volume=19|issue=3|pages=347–363|publisher =[[Sage Publications|Sage]] |doi=10.1177/03058298900190030401|date= December 1990|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03058298900190030401 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affects their ability to define state interests and develop suitable solutions within cross-boundary [[environmental regulation]].&lt;ref name="litfin 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Litfin | first = Karen T. | title = Environment, wealth, and authority: global climate change and emerging modes of legitimation | journal = [[International Studies Review]], special issue: Continuity and Change in the Westphalian Order | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–148 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1521-9488.00207 | jstor = 3186430 | date = Summer 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1521-9488.00207 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, conditions of [[uncertainty]] are produced which stimulate a demand for new information.&lt;ref name="zito2001a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Zito | first = Anthony R. | title = Epistemic communities, collective entrepreneurship and European integration | journal = [[Journal of European Public Policy]] | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 585–603 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13501760110064401 | date = January 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501760110064401 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental [[crises]] play a significant role in exacerbating conditions of uncertainty for decision-makers.&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; Political elites seek expert knowledge and advice to reduce this technical uncertainty, on issues including:
* the scale of environmental problems,
* cause-and-effect interrelations of ecological processes, and
* how ([[science]]-based) policy options will play out.&lt;ref name="meijerink 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Meijerink | first = Sander | title = Understanding policy stability and change. the interplay of advocacy coalitions and epistemic communities, windows of opportunity, and Dutch coastal flooding policy 1945–2003 | journal = [[Journal of European Public Policy]] | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 1060–1077 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13501760500270745 | date = December 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501760500270745 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, epistemic communities can frame environmental problems as they see fit, and environmental decision-makers begin to make policy-shaping decisions based on these specific depictions.&lt;ref name="zito 2001b"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Zito | first = Anthony R. | title = Epistemic communities, European Union governance and the public voice | journal = Science and Public Policy | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 465–476 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.3152/147154301781781183 | date = December 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.3152/147154301781781183 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial identification and bounding of environmental issues by epistemic community members is very influential.&lt;ref name="toke 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Toke | first = Dave | title = Epistemic communities and environmental groups | journal = Politics | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–102 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9256.00091 | date = May 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9256.00091 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can limit what would be preferable in terms of national interests, frame what issues are available for collective debate, and delimit the policy alternatives deemed possible.&lt;ref name="haas 1990"/&gt; The political effects are not easily reversible.&lt;ref name="adler and haas 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Adler| first1=Emanuel|last2=Haas|first2=Peter M.|authorlink2=Peter M. Haas|title=Conclusion: epistemic communities, world order, and the creation of a reflective research program|journal=[[International Organization]], special issue: Knowledge, Power, and International Policy Coordination|volume=46|issue=1|pages=367–390|publisher =[[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] |doi=10.1017/S0020818300001533|jstor=2706960|date= Winter 1992|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0020818300001533 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epistemic community vision is institutionalised as a collective set of understandings reflected in any subsequent policy choices.&lt;ref name="adler and haas 1992"/&gt;

This is a key point of power. Policy actors are persuaded to conform to the community’s consensual, knowledge-driven ideas without the epistemic community requiring a more material form of power.&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; Members of successful communities can become strong actors at the national and international level as decision-makers attach responsibility to their advice.&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt;

As a result, epistemic communities have a direct input on how international cooperation may develop in the long term.&lt;ref name="haas 1990"/&gt; Transboundary environmental problems require a unified response rather than patchwork policy efforts, but this is problematic due to enduring differences of state interest and concerns over reciprocity.&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt; The transnational nature of epistemic communities means numerous states may absorb new patterns of logic and behaviour, leading to the adoption of concordant state policies.&lt;ref name="haas 1990"/&gt; Therefore, the likelihood of convergent state behaviour and associated international coordination is increased.

International cooperation is further facilitated if powerful states are involved, as a quasi-structure is created containing the reasons, expectations and arguments for coordination.&lt;ref name="adler and haas 1992"/&gt; Also, if epistemic community members have developed authoritative bureaucratic reputations in various countries, they are likely to participate in the creation and running of national and international institutions that directly pursue international policy coordination, for example, a [[regulatory agency]], [[think tank]] or governmental research body.&lt;ref name="haas 1992"/&gt;

As a result, epistemic community members in a number of different countries can become connected through intergovernmental channels, as well as existing community channels, producing a [[transnational governance]] network, and facilitating the promotion of international policy coordination. An example of a scientific epistemic community in action is the 1975 collectively negotiated Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP), a marine [[pollution control]] regime for the [[Mediterranean Sea]] developed by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]].&lt;ref name="haas 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas |first=Peter M.|authorlink=Peter M. Haas|title=Do regimes matter?

'''Forensic electrical engineering''' is a branch of [[forensic engineering]], and is concerned with investigating electrical failures and accidents in a legal context.   Many forensic electrical engineering investigations apply to fires suspected to be caused by electrical failures.   Forensic electrical engineers are most commonly retained by insurance companies or attorneys representing insurance companies, or by manufacturers or contractors defending themselves against [[subrogation]] by insurance companies. Other areas of investigation include [[accident]] investigation involving [[electric shock|electrocution]], and [[intellectual property]] disputes such as [[patent]] actions. Additionally, since electrical fires are most often cited as the cause for "suspect" fires an electrical engineer is often employed to evaluate the electrical equipment and systems to determine whether the cause of the fire was electrical in nature.

==Goals==
The ultimate goal of these investigations is often to determine the legal liability for a [[fire]] or other [[accident]] for purposes of [[insurance]] [[subrogation]] or an injury lawsuit.   Some examples include:
* ''Defective appliances'':   If a property fire was caused by an appliance which had a manufacturing or design defect (for example, a [[coffee maker]] overheating and igniting), making it unreasonably hazardous, the insurance company might attempt to collect the cost of the fire damage ("subrogate") from the manufacturer; if the fire caused personal injury or death, the injured party might also attempt an injury lawsuit against the manufacturer, in addition to the carrier of health or life insurance attempting subrogation.
* ''Improper workmanship'':   If, for example, an [[electrician]] made an improper installation in a house, leading to an electrical fault and fire, he or she could likewise be the target of subrogation or an injury lawsuit (for this reason, electricians are required to carry liability insurance).
* ''Electrical injury'':   If an electrical fault or unreasonably hazardous electrical system causes an [[Electric shock|electrical injury]] ("electrocution" if the injury is fatal), the party responsible for the electrical accident can be the target of insurance subrogation or an injury lawsuit.
* ''Equipment failure'': if electrical equipment stops functioning, it can cause a loss of income (such as a factory losing productivity due to inoperative equipment) or additional damage (such as food products spoiling due to loss of refrigeration), and again be the subject of a subrogation or liability case.   Liability in such a case can also include the cost of repairing or replacing the equipment, which can be substantial.

==Applications==
Forensic electrical engineers are also involved in some [[arson]] and set-fire investigations; while it is not common for arsonists to cause electrical failures to ignite fires, the presence of electrical appliances and systems in many fires scenes often requires them to be evaluated as possible accidental causes of the fire.   Some electrical means of ignition, when discovered, are fairly obvious to an [[origin and cause investigator]] and most likely do not require consulting with a forensic electrical engineer.   (Note that "arson" refers specifically to a criminal act, subject to criminal prosecution; a more general term is a "set fire".   A homeowner setting a fire deliberately in order to defraud an insurance company might be prosecuted for arson by a government body; however, the insurance company would concern itself only with denying the insurance claim, possibly leading to a civil lawsuit.)

Patent disputes may also require the expert opinion of an electrical engineer to advise a court. Issues in conflict may include the precise meaning of technical terms, especially in the [[claim (patent)|patent claim]]s, the [[prior art]] in a particular product field and the [[inventive step and non-obviousness|obviousness]] of various patents.

==Liability==
Most states have a statute of ultimate repose (similar to, but not to be confused with, a statute of limitations) that limits the length of time after which a party can legally be held liable for their negligent act or defective product.  Many states have a "useful life" statute of ultimate repose.  Therefore, a determination of the length of time the product would normally be expected to be used before wearing out needs to be made. For example, a refrigerator might have a longer "useful life" than an electric fan; an airplane might have a longer useful life than a car.  Some states pick an arbitrary number of years for the statute of ultimate repose.  It may be short (six or seven years) or longer 15 or 25 years.  If a coffee maker starts on fire after the statute of ultimate repose has expired, the manufacturer can no longer be held liable for manufacturing or design defects.  The statute of ultimate repose is different from the statute of limitations.  In a state with a short statute of ultimate repose, it is common that a person's right to bring a claim in court expires before their injury ever occurs.  Thus, if a defective product (for example a car) caused a collision when the steering failed, but the collision occurred after the expiration of a statute of ultimate repose, no claim could be brought against the manufacturer for selling a defective product.  The right to bring the claim expired before the claim even occurred.

[[File:Galileo before the Holy Office.jpg|thumb|300px|''Galileo before the Holy Office'', a 19th-century painting by [[Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury]]]]

The '''Galileo affair''' ({{lang-it|il processo a Galileo Galilei}}) was a sequence of events, beginning around 1610,&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell ([[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|1991]], p.2). Blackwell ([[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|1991]], p.50) dates the start of the Galileo affair to 1610. Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wKCZFJuMCaQC&amp;pg=PA1 p.1]) puts it a few years later, in 1613.&lt;/ref&gt; culminating with the trial and condemnation of [[Galileo Galilei]] by the [[Roman Inquisition|Roman Catholic Inquisition]] in 1633 for his support of [[heliocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wKCZFJuMCaQC&amp;pg=PA1 p.1]): "By the 'Galileo affair' is meant the sequence of developments which began in 1613 and culminated with the trial and condemnation of Galileo Galilei by the Roman Catholic Inquisition in 1633."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1610, Galileo published his ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' (''Starry Messenger''), describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new [[telescope]], namely the [[phases of Venus]] and the [[Galilean moons]] of [[Jupiter]]. With these observations he promoted the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (published in ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' in 1543). Galileo's initial discoveries were met with opposition within the Catholic Church, and in 1616 the Inquisition declared heliocentrism to be formally heretical. Heliocentric books were banned and Galileo was ordered to refrain from holding, teaching or defending heliocentric ideas.&lt;ref name=h218 /&gt;

Galileo went on to propose a theory of [[tide]]s in 1616, and of comets in 1619; he argued that the tides were evidence for the motion of the earth. In 1632 Galileo, now an old man, published his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', which implicitly defended heliocentrism, and was immensely popular. Responding to mounting controversy over [[theology]], [[astronomy]] and [[philosophy]], the [[Roman Inquisition]] tried Galileo in 1633 and found him "vehemently suspect of [[heresy]]", sentencing him to [[indefinite imprisonment]]. Galileo was kept under house arrest until his death in 1642.

==Initial controversies==
[[File:Jupiter family.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[moons of Jupiter]], named after Galileo, orbiting their parent planet. Galileo viewed these moons as a smaller Copernican system within the Solar system and used them to support [[Heliocentrism]].]]
Galileo began his telescopic observations in the later part of 1609, and by March 1610 was able to publish a small book, ''The Starry Messenger'' (''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]''), describing some of his discoveries: mountains on the [[Moon]], lesser moons in orbit around [[Jupiter]], and the resolution of what had been thought to be very cloudy masses in the sky (nebulae) into collections of stars too faint to see individually without a telescope. Other observations followed, including the phases of [[Venus]] and the existence of [[sunspot]]s.
 
[[Galileo Galilei#Contributions|Galileo's contributions]] caused difficulties for [[Theology|theologians]] and [[natural philosophers]] of the time, as they contradicted scientific and philosophical ideas based on those of [[Aristotle]] and [[Ptolemy]] and closely associated with the Catholic Church. In particular, Galileo's observations of the phases of Venus, which showed it to circle the sun, and the observation of moons orbiting Jupiter, contradicted the [[geocentric model]] of [[Ptolemy]], which was backed and accepted by the Roman Catholic Church,&lt;ref name="Ashmand"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos; Or, Quadripartite Being Four Books of The influence of the Stars |first1=J.

[[Jesuit]] astronomers, experts both in Church teachings, science, and in natural philosophy, were at first skeptical and hostile to the new ideas; however, within a year or two the availability of good telescopes enabled them to repeat the observations. In 1611, Galileo visited the [[Collegium Romanum]] in Rome, where the Jesuit astronomers by that time had repeated his observations. [[Christoph Grienberger]], one of the Jesuit scholars on the faculty, sympathized with Galileo’s theories, but was asked to defend the Aristotelian viewpoint by [[Claudio Acquaviva]], the Father General of the Jesuits. Not all of Galileo's claims were completely accepted: [[Christopher Clavius]], the most distinguished astronomer of his age, never was reconciled to the idea of mountains on the Moon, and outside the collegium many still disputed the reality of the observations. In a letter to [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] of August 1610,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.162)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p.86)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=10-421 (1900, 10:421–423)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230546/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=10-421 |date=September 27, 2007 }} {{la icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo complained that some of the philosophers who opposed his discoveries had refused even to look through a telescope:&lt;ref&gt;Galileo did not name the philosophers concerned, but Galileo scholars have identified two of them as Cesare Cremonini and Giulio Libri [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(Drake, 1978, pp.162, 165;]] [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt, 1994, p.87)]]. Claims of similar refusals by bishops and cardinals have sometimes been made, but there appears to be no evidence to support them.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|My dear Kepler, I wish that we might laugh at the remarkable stupidity of the common herd. What do you have to say about the principal philosophers of this academy who are filled with the stubbornness of an asp and do not want to look at either the planets, the moon or the telescope, even though I have freely and deliberately offered them the opportunity a thousand times?

[[File:Ptolemaeus.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Claudius Ptolemy]] (A.D. 90–168), whose [[Geocentrism|geocentric]] system was adopted by the Catholic Church,&lt;ref name="Ashmand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kasting" /&gt; and supplanted by the work of [[Nicholas Copernicus|Copernicus]] and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.]]

Geocentrists who did verify and accept Galileo's findings had an alternative to Ptolemy's model in an [[Tychonic system|alternative geocentric (or "geo-heliocentric") model]] proposed some decades earlier by [[Tycho Brahe]] – a model, in which, for example, Venus circled the sun. Brahe argued that the distance to the stars in the Copernican system would have to be 700 times greater than the distance from the sun to Saturn. Moreover, the only way the stars could be so distant and still appear the sizes they do in the sky would be if even average stars were gigantic – at least as big as the orbit of the earth, and of course vastly larger than the sun (refer to article on [[Tychonic System]]).

Galileo became involved in a dispute over priority in the discovery of sunspots with [[Christoph Scheiner]], a Jesuit. This became a bitter lifelong feud. Neither of them, however, was the first to recognise sunspots – the Chinese had already been familiar with them for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p.98)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, Galileo also engaged in a dispute over the reasons that objects float or sink in water, siding with [[Archimedes]] against Aristotle. The debate was unfriendly, and Galileo's blunt and sometimes sarcastic style, though not extraordinary in academic debates of the time, made him enemies. During this controversy one of Galileo's friends, the painter [[Cigoli|Lodovico Cardi da Cigoli]], informed him that a group of malicious opponents, which Cigoli subsequently referred to derisively as "the Pigeon league",&lt;ref&gt;"La legha del Pippione" [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|(Favaro]], [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-476 1901, 11:476)] {{it icon}}. "The Pigeon" ("il Pippione") was Cigoli's derisive nickname for the presumed leader of the group, Lodovico delle Colombe [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|(Sharratt, 1994, p.95;]] [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]], [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-176 1901, 11:176,] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-228 11:228–29,] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221173004/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-228 |date=February 21, 2009 }} [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-502 11:502)]. It is a pun on Colombe's surname, which is the feminine plural form of the Italian word for "Dove." "Pippione" is a now obsolete Italian word with a triple entendre—besides meaning "young pigeon", it was also a jocular colloquialism for a testicle, and a Tuscan dialect word for a fool.&lt;/ref&gt; was plotting to cause him trouble over the motion of the earth, or anything else that would serve the purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.180)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro (1901)]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-241 11:241–42)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221180154/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=11-241 |date=February 21, 2009 }} {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cigoli, one of the plotters asked a priest to denounce Galileo's views from the pulpit, but the latter refused. Nevertheless, three years later another priest, [[Tommaso Caccini]], did in fact do precisely that, [[#caccinisermon|as described below]].

==Bible argument==
{{Main|Biblical cosmology}}{{Further|Biblical inerrancy}}
In the Catholic world prior to Galileo's conflict with the Church, the majority of educated people subscribed to the Aristotelian [[geocentrism|geocentric]] view that the earth was the [[History of the Center of the Universe|center of the universe]] and that all heavenly bodies revolved around the earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackwell|first=Richard|title=Galileo, Bellarmine, and the Bible|date=1991|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|location=Notre Dame|isbn=0268010242|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MHnwAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] theories were used to reform the calendar in 1582.&lt;ref&gt;"The Gregorian calendar, first adopted in 1582, was in fact based on computations that made use of Copernicus' work." {{cite book|author=Thomas Kuhn|title=The Copernican Revolution|page=125|date=1957|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|upright|Christian painting of God creating the cosmos (Bible Moralisee, French, 13th century)]]
Geostaticism agreed with a [[Biblical literalism|literal interpretation]] of Scripture in several places, such as {{bibleref2|1 Chronicles|16:30}}, {{bibleref2|Psalm|93:1}}, {{bibleref2|Psalm|96:10}}, {{bibleref2|Psalm|104:5}}, {{bibleref2|Ecclesiastes|1:5}} (but see varied interpretations of {{bibleref2|Job|26:7}}). [[Heliocentrism]], the theory that the earth was a planet, which along with all the others revolved around the sun, contradicted both [[geocentrism]] and the prevailing theological support of the theory.

One of the first suggestions of heresy that Galileo had to deal with came in 1613 from a professor of philosophy, poet and specialist in Greek literature, [[Cosimo Boscaglia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Four Treatises for the Reconsideration of the History of Science'', Fabio J. a. Farina&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron (2010), p.369&lt;/ref&gt; In conversation with Galileo's patron [[Cosimo II de' Medici]] and Cosimo's mother [[Christina of Lorraine]], Boscaglia said that the telescopic discoveries were valid, but that the motion of the earth was obviously contrary to Scripture:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dr. Boscaglia had talked to Madame [Christina] for a while, and though he conceded all the things you have discovered in the sky, he said that the motion of the earth was incredible and could not be, particularly since Holy Scripture obviously was contrary to such motion.&lt;ref name=langford&gt;{{cite book|last=Langford|first=Jerome J.|title=Galileo, science, and the church (with foreword by Stillman Drake)|date=1992|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor|isbn=0472065106|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcDrMlJjlLoC|edition=3rd}} &lt;small&gt;-Letter from Benedetto Castelli to Galileo, 1613–14&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Galileo was defended on the spot by his former student [[Benedetto Castelli]], now a professor of mathematics and [[Benedictine]] [[abbot]]. The exchange having been reported to Galileo by Castelli, Galileo decided to write a [[letter to Castelli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/galileo/lettercastelli.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206071010/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/galileo/lettercastelli.html |archivedate=2011-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; expounding his views on what he considered the most appropriate way of treating scriptural passages which made assertions about natural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p.109)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1615, he expanded this into his much longer ''[[Letter to Grand Duchess Christina|Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, pp.112–26)]].&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div id=caccinisermon&gt;[[Tommaso Caccini]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]], appears to have made the first dangerous attack on Galileo. Preaching a sermon in [[Florence]] at the end of 1614, he denounced Galileo, his associates, and mathematicians in general (a category that included astronomers).&lt;ref name=speller&gt;{{cite book |last1=Speller |first1= Jules |title=Galileo's Inquisition Trial Revisited |date=2008 |publisher= Peter Lang |pages= 57–58 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jviElHq-kEcC |isbn= 978-3-631-56229-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biblical text for the sermon on that day was [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 10, in which Joshua makes the sun stand still;&lt;ref name=speller /&gt;&lt;ref name=mfhackett&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finocchiario|first1=Maurice|title=The Essential Galileo|date=2014|publisher=Hackett Publishing|pages=168–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was the story that Castelli had to interpret for the Medici family the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayer|first1=Thomas|title=The Trial of Galileo, 1612–1633|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|pages=49–55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dNa-zidSXGYC&amp;pg=PA49|isbn=9781442605190}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said, though it is not verifiable, that Caccini also used the passage from [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 1:11, "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?".&lt;ref name=naess&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naess|first1=Atle|title=Galileo Galilei – When the World Stood Still|date=2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|pages=89–91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9fWI6vfgjo8C|isbn=978-3-540-27054-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==First meetings with theological authorities==
In late 1614 or early 1615, one of Caccini's fellow Dominicans, [[Niccolò Lorini]], acquired a copy of Galileo's letter to Castelli. Lorini and other Dominicans at the Convent of San Marco considered the letter of doubtful orthodoxy, in part because it may have violated the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]]:

{{quote|...to check unbridled spirits, [the Holy Council] decrees that no one relying on his own judgement shall, in matters of faith and morals pertaining to the edification of Christian doctrine, distorting the Scriptures in accordance with his own conceptions, presume to interpret them contrary to that sense which the holy mother Church... has held or holds...|Decree of the Council of Trent (1545–1563). Quoted in Langford, 1992.&lt;ref name="Langford 1992, p.56-57"&gt;Langford (1992), p.56-57&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Council of Trent.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–63) sitting in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]]. The [[Roman Inquisition]] suspected Galileo of violating the decrees of the Council. Museo Diocesano Tridentino, Trento.]]
Lorini and his colleagues decided to bring Galileo's letter to the attention of the Inquisition. In February 1615 Lorini accordingly sent a copy to the Secretary of the Inquisition, Cardinal [[Paolo Emilio Sfondrati]], with a covering letter critical of Galileo's supporters:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.240)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, pp.110–111)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=19&amp;VOLPAG=297 (1907, 19:297–298)] {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|All our Fathers of the devout Convent of St. Mark feel that the letter contains many statements which seem presumptuous or suspect, as when it states that the words of Holy Scripture do not mean what they say; that in discussions about natural phenomena the authority of Scripture should rank last... .

Quoted in Langford, 1992&lt;ref name="Langford 1992, p.56-57"/&gt;|source=}}

On March 19, Caccini arrived at the [[Inquisition]]'s offices in Rome to denounce Galileo for his [[Heliocentrism|Copernicanism]] and various other alleged heresies supposedly being spread by his pupils.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p.111)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=19&amp;VOLPAG=307 (1907, 19:307–311)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233248/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=19&amp;VOLPAG=307 |date=September 27, 2007 }} {{la icon}}{{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo soon heard reports that Lorini had obtained a copy of his letter to Castelli and was claiming that it contained many heresies. He also heard that Caccini had gone to Rome and suspected him of trying to stir up trouble with Lorini's copy of the letter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.241)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=5&amp;VOLPAG=291 (1895, 5:291–292)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231150/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=5&amp;VOLPAG=291 |date=September 27, 2007 }} {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As 1615 wore on he became more concerned, and eventually determined to go to Rome as soon as his health permitted, which it did at the end of the year. By presenting his case there, he hoped to clear his name of any suspicion of heresy, and to persuade the Church authorities not to suppress heliocentric ideas.

In going to Rome Galileo was acting against the advice of friends and allies, and of the Tuscan ambassador to Rome, [[Piero Guicciardini]].&lt;ref&gt;Langford, 1992, p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bellarmine's view==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
[[File:Saint Robert Bellarmine.png|thumb|upright|Cardinal [[Robert Bellarmine]] (1542–1621), who deliberated upon Galileo's writings in 1615–6, and ordered him to refrain from holding, teaching or discussing [[Heliocentrism|Copernicanism]]]]
Cardinal [[Robert Bellarmine]], one of the most respected Catholic theologians of the time, was called on to adjudicate the dispute between Galileo and his opponents. The question of heliocentrism had first been raised with Cardinal Bellarmine, in the case of [[Paolo Antonio Foscarini]], a [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] father; Foscarini had published a book, ''Lettera ... sopra l'opinione ... del Copernico'', which attempted to reconcile Copernicus with the biblical passages that seemed to be in contradiction. Bellarmine at first expressed the opinion that Copernicus's book would not be banned, but would at most require some editing so as to present the theory purely as a calculating device for "[[Scientific formalism|saving the appearances]]" (i.e. preserving the observable evidence).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|Blackwell (1991, p.74)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p.112)]] "Saving the appearances" meant that the theory could enable astronomers to accurately predict and explain all the empirically observed apparent motions of the Sun, Moon, stars and planets.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foscarini sent a copy of his book to Bellarmine, who replied in a letter of April 12, 1615.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|Blackwell (1991, p.265–67)]], [[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|Finocchiaro (1989, p.67–9)]]. A copy of Finocchiaro's translation of the letter [http://www.disf.org/en/documentation/03-Bellarmino.asp is available on-line].&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo is mentioned by name in the letter, and a copy was soon sent to him. After some preliminary salutations and acknowledgements, Bellarmine begins by telling Foscarini that it is prudent for him and Galileo to limit themselves to treating heliocentrism as a merely hypothetical phenomenon and not a physically real one. Further on he says that interpreting heliocentrism as physically real would be "a very dangerous thing, likely not only to irritate all scholastic philosophers and theologians, but also to harm the Holy Faith by rendering Holy Scripture as false." Moreover, while the topic was not inherently a matter of faith, the statements about it in Scripture ''were'' so by virtue of who said them – namely, the Holy Spirit. He conceded that if there were conclusive proof, "then one would have to proceed with great care in explaining the Scriptures that appear contrary; and say rather that we do not understand them, than that what is demonstrated is false." However, demonstrating that heliocentrism merely "saved the appearances" could not be regarded as sufficient to establish that it was physically real. Although he believed that the former may well have been possible, he had "very great doubts" that the latter would be, and in case of doubt it was not permissible to depart from the traditional interpretation of Scriptures. His final argument was a rebuttal of an analogy that Foscarini had made between a moving earth and a ship on which the passengers perceive themselves as apparently stationary and the receding shore as apparently moving. Bellarmine replied that in the case of the ship the passengers know that their perceptions are erroneous and can mentally correct them, whereas the scientist on the earth clearly experiences that it is stationary and therefore the perception that the sun, moon and stars are moving is not in error and does not need to be corrected.

Bellarmine found no problem with heliocentrism so long as it was treated as a purely hypothetical calculating device and not as a physically real phenomenon, but he did not regard it as permissible to advocate the latter unless it could be conclusively proved through current scientific standards. This put Galileo in a difficult position, because he believed that the available evidence strongly favoured heliocentrism, and he wished to be able to publish his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p.115-25)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Francesco Ingoli==
In addition to Bellarmine, Monsignor [[Francesco Ingoli]] initiated a debate with Galileo, sending him in January 1616 an essay disputing the Copernican system. Galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the action against Copernicanism that followed in February.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 68–69)]] Ingoli's essay was published in English translation for the first time in 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Maurice Finocchiaro, Ingoli had probably been commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy, and the essay provided the "chief direct basis" for the ban.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-2010|Finocchiaro (2010, pp. 72)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism. It borrowed primarily from the arguments of Tycho Brahe, and it notedly mentioned Brahe's argument that heliocentrism required the stars to be much larger than the sun. Ingoli wrote that the great distance to the stars in the heliocentric theory "clearly proves ... the fixed stars to be of such size, as they may surpass or equal the size of the orbit circle of the Earth itself."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 71)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ingoli included four theological arguments in the essay, but suggested to Galileo that he focus on the physical and mathematical arguments. Galileo did not write a response to Ingoli until 1624, in which, among other arguments and evidence, he listed the results of experiments such as [[Galileo's ship|dropping a rock from the mast of a moving ship]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 66–76, 164–175, 187–195)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inquisition and first judgement, 1616==
[[File:Paul V Caravaggio.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Pope Paul V]] (1552–1621), who ordered that the inquisitorial commission's 1616 judgement be delivered to Galileo by Cardinal Bellarmine]]

===Deliberation===

On February 19, 1616, the Inquisition asked a commission of theologians, known as qualifiers, about the propositions of the heliocentric view of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Fantoli-2005|Fantoli (2005, p.118)]], [[#Reference-McMullin-2005b|McMullin (2005b, p.152)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]][http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=19&amp;VOLPAG=320 (1907, 19:320)] {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians of the Galileo affair have offered different accounts of why the matter was referred to the qualifiers at this time. [[#Reference-Beretta-2005a|Beretta]] points out that the Inquisition had taken a deposition from Gianozzi Attavanti in November 1615,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Beretta-2005a|Beretta (2005a, pp.247–248)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]][http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=19&amp;VOLPAG=318 (1907, 19:318)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233312/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=19&amp;VOLPAG=318 |date=September 27, 2007 }} {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of its investigation into the denunciations of Galileo by Lorini and Caccini. In this deposition, Attavanti confirmed that Galileo had advocated the Copernican doctrines of a stationary sun and a mobile earth, and as a consequence the Tribunal of the Inquisition would have eventually needed to determine the theological status of those doctrines. It is however possible, as surmised by the Tuscan ambassador, Piero Guiccardini, in a letter to the Grand Duke,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-McMullin-2005b|McMullin (2005b, pp.167–168)]], [[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.252)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p.127)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=12&amp;VOLPAG=242 (1902,12:242)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230553/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=12&amp;VOLPAG=242 |date=September 27, 2007 }} {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that the actual referral may have been precipitated by Galileo's aggressive campaign to prevent the condemnation of Copernicanism.&lt;ref&gt;An inaccuracy in Guicciardini's letter has led some historians (e.g. [[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake, 1978, p.252]]; [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt, 1994, p.127]]) to identify a meeting between Cardinal Orsini and the Pope as the specific incident which triggered the Copernican propositions' referral to the qualifiers. This cannot have been the case, however, because the meeting did not occur until several days ''after'' the propositions had been referred to them. [[#Reference-McMullin-2005b|(McMullin, 2005b, pp.152, 153)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judgement===

On February 24 the Qualifiers delivered their unanimous report: the proposition that the sun is stationary at the centre of the universe is "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture"; the proposition that the earth moves and is not at the centre of the universe "receives the same judgement in philosophy; and ... in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#conreport |title=The Galileo Affair: A Documentary History |publisher=University of California Press |date=1989 |accessdate=October 29, 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#conreport |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Graney semicolon"&gt;{{Citation | last = Graney | first = Christopher M. | title = The Inquisition's Semicolon: Punctuation, Translation, and Science in the 1616 Condemnation of the Copernican System | journal = | volume = 1402| pages = arXiv:1402.6168 | publisher = | place = | date = March 2014 | type = pdf | bibcode = 2014arXiv1402.6168G | url = https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.6168v2 | accessdate = 9 August 2016 | arxiv=1402.6168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original report document was made widely available in 2014.&lt;ref name = "Graney semicolon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Domínguez | first = Nuño | date = Feb 2014 | title = Una errata reproducida durante siglos cambia la censura de la Iglesia a Galileo | periodical = Materia | url = http://esmateria.com/2014/02/28/una-errata-reproducida-durante-siglos-cambia-la-censura-de-la-iglesia-a-galileo/ | accessdate = 9 August 2016 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting of the cardinals of the Inquisition on the following day, [[Pope Paul V]] instructed Bellarmine to deliver this result to Galileo, and to order him to abandon the Copernican opinions; should Galileo resist the decree, stronger action would be taken. On February 26, Galileo was called to Bellarmine's residence and ordered,

{{quote|to abstain completely from teaching or defending this doctrine and opinion or from discussing it... to abandon completely... the opinion that the sun stands still at the center of the world and the earth moves, and henceforth not to hold, teach, or defend it in any way whatever, either orally or in writing.|The Inquisition's injunction against Galileo, 1616.&lt;ref name=h218&gt;Heilbron (2010), p.218&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Index Librorum Prohibitorum 1.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'', a list of books banned by the Catholic Church. Following the Inquisition's 1616 judgment, the works of Copernicus, Galileo, [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and others advocating heliocentrism were banned.]]
With no attractive alternatives, Galileo accepted the orders delivered, even sterner than those recommended by the Pope.&lt;ref name=h218 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.253)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo met again with Bellarmine, apparently on friendly terms; and on March 11 he met with the Pope, who assured him that he was safe from persecution so long as he, the Pope, should live. Nonetheless, Galileo's friends [[Giovanni Francesco Sagredo|Sagredo]] and Castelli reported that there were rumors that Galileo had been forced to [[recant]] and do penance. To protect his good name, Galileo requested a letter from Bellarmine stating the truth of the matter. This letter assumed great importance in 1633, as did the question whether Galileo had been ordered not to "hold or defend" Copernican ideas (which would have allowed their hypothetical treatment) or not to teach them in any way. If the Inquisition had issued the order not to teach heliocentrism at all, it would have been ignoring Bellarmine's position.

In the end, Galileo did not persuade the Church to stay out of the controversy, but instead saw [[heliocentrism]] formally declared false. It was consequently termed heretical by the Qualifiers, since it contradicted the literal meaning of the Scriptures, though this position was not binding on the Church.

===Copernican books banned===

Following the Inquisition's injunction against Galileo, the papal [[Theologian of the Pontifical Household|Master of the Sacred Palace]] ordered that Foscarini's ''Letter'' be banned, and Copernicus' ''De revolutionibus'' suspended until corrected. The papal [[Congregation of the Index]] preferred a stricter prohibition, and so with the Pope's approval, on March 5 the Congregation banned all books advocating the Copernican system, which it called "the false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to Holy Scripture."&lt;ref name=h218 /&gt;

Francesco Ingoli, a consultor to the Holy Office, recommended that ''De revolutionibus'' be amended rather than banned due to its utility for calendrics. In 1618 the Congregation of the Index accepted his recommendation, and published their decision two years later, allowing a corrected version of Copernicus' book to be used. The uncorrected ''De revolutionibus'' remained on the Index of banned books until 1758.&lt;ref&gt;Finnochiario (2007), p.154&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo's works advocating Copernicanism were therefore banned, and his sentence prohibited him from "teaching, defending… or discussing" Copernicanism. In Germany, Kepler's works were also banned by the papal order.&lt;ref name=retrying&gt;{{cite book|last=Finochiario|first=Maurice|title=Retrying Galileo|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Dialogue''==

In 1623, [[Pope Gregory XV]] died and was succeeded by [[Pope Urban VIII]] who showed greater favor to Galileo, particularly after Galileo traveled to Rome to congratulate the new Pontiff.&lt;ref name=Youngson&gt;Youngson, Robert M. ''Scientific Blunders: A Brief History of How Wrong Scientists Can Sometimes Be''; Carroll &amp; Graff Publishers, Inc.; 1998; Pages 290–293&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo's ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', which was published in 1632 to great popularity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080829.w50booksdialogue/BNStory/DAVA+SOBEL | work=The Globe and Mail | first=Dava | last=Sobel | title= Galileo's Dialogue}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an account of conversations between a Copernican scientist, Salviati, an impartial and witty scholar named Sagredo, and a ponderous Aristotelian named Simplicio, who employed stock arguments in support of geocentricity, and was depicted in the book as being an intellectually inept fool. Simplicio's arguments are systematically refuted and ridiculed by the other two characters with what Youngson calls "unassailable proof" for the Copernican theory (at least versus the theory of Ptolemy – as Finocchiaro points out, "the Copernican and Tychonic systems were [[Observational equivalence|observationally equivalent]] and the available evidence could be explained equally well by either"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Li4eh7JIMtIC&amp;pg=PA54 p.54)]&lt;/ref&gt;), which reduces Simplicio to baffled rage, and makes the author's position unambiguous.&lt;ref name=Youngson/&gt; Indeed, although Galileo states in the preface of his book that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher ([[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] in Latin, Simplicio in Italian), the name "Simplicio" in Italian also had the connotation of "simpleton."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Li4eh7JIMtIC&amp;pg=PA82 p.82)]; [[#Reference-Moss&amp;Wallace-2003|Moss &amp; Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&amp;pg=PA11 p.11)]&lt;/ref&gt; Authors Langford and [[Stillman Drake]] asserted that Simplicio was modeled on philosophers [[Lodovico delle Colombe]] and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]]. Pope Urban demanded that his own arguments be included in the book. which resulted in Galileo putting them in the mouth of Simplicio. Some months after the book's publication, [[Pope Urban VIII]] banned its sale and had its text submitted for examination by a special commission.&lt;ref name=Youngson/&gt;

With the loss of many of his defenders in Rome because of ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'', in 1633 Galileo was ordered to stand trial on suspicion of heresy "for holding as true the false doctrine taught by some that the sun is the center of the world" against the 1616 condemnation, since "it was decided at the Holy Congregation [...] on 25 Feb 1616 that [...] the Holy Office would give you an injunction to abandon this doctrine, not to teach it to others, not to defend it, and not to treat of it; and that if you did not acquiesce in this injunction, you should be imprisoned".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|Finocchiaro (1989, p.288)]]. A copy of this quotation, taken from Finocchiaro's translation of the Inquisition's judgement against Galileo is [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#sentence available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo was interrogated while threatened with physical torture.&lt;ref name=retrying /&gt; A panel of theologians, consisting of [[Melchior Inchofer]], [[Agostino Oreggi]] and [[Zaccaria Pasqualigo]], reported on the ''Dialogue''. Their opinions were strongly argued in favour of the view that the ''Dialogue'' taught the Copernican theory.&lt;ref&gt;Sharratt ([[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|1994]], pp.172–3]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo was found guilty, and the sentence of the Inquisition, issued on 22 June 1633,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/galileo/condemnation.html|title=Papal Condemnation (Sentence) of Galileo in 1633|publisher=[[University of Missouri—Kansas City]]|accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was in three essential parts:
* Galileo was found "vehemently suspect of heresy", namely of having held the opinions that the sun lies motionless at the center of the universe, that the earth is not at its centre and moves, and that one may hold and defend an opinion as probable after it has been declared contrary to Holy Scripture. He was required to [[Abjuration|"abjure, curse, and detest"]] those opinions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Fantoli-2005|Fantoli (2005, p.139)]], [[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|Finocchiaro (1989, p.288–293)]]. Finocchiaro's translation of the Inquisition's judgment against Galileo is [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#sentence available online]. "Vehemently suspect of heresy" was a technical term of [[canon law]] and did not necessarily imply that the Inquisition considered the opinions giving rise to the verdict to be heretical. The same verdict would have been possible even if the opinions had been subject only to the less serious censure of "erroneous in faith" [[#Reference-Fantoli-2005|(Fantoli, 2005, p.140]]; [[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|Heilbron, 2005, pp.282–284)]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* He was sentenced to formal imprisonment at the pleasure of the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|Finocchiaro (1989]], pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=wKCZFJuMCaQC&amp;pg=PA38 38], 291, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wKCZFJuMCaQC&amp;pg=PA306 306)].

* His offending ''Dialogue'' was banned; and in an action not announced at the trial, publication of any of his works was forbidden, including any he might write in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|_note-publication-ban}}[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.367)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p.184)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=209 (1905, 16:209,] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230419/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=209 |date=September 27, 2007 }} [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=230 230)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234122/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=230 |date=September 27, 2007 }}{{it icon}}. When Fulgenzio Micanzio, one of Galileo's friends in Venice, sought to have Galileo's ''Discourse on Floating Bodies'' reprinted in 1635, he was informed by the Venetian Inquisitor that the Inquisition had forbidden further publication of any of Galileo's works [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|(Favaro]], [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=209 1905, 16:209)] {{it icon}}, and was later shown a copy of the order [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|(Favaro]], [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=230 1905, 16:230)] .{{it icon}} When the Dutch publishers [[House of Elzevir|Elzevir]] published Galileo's ''Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences'' in 1638, some five years after his trial, they did so under the pretense that a manuscript he had presented to the French Ambassador to Rome for preservation and circulation to interested intellectuals had been used without his knowledge ([[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt, 1994, p.184;]] [[#Reference-Galileo-1954|Galilei, 1954]] [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=753&amp;chapter=109888&amp;layout=html p.xvii]; [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]], [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=8&amp;VOLPAG=43 1898, 8:43] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231938/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=8&amp;VOLPAG=43 |date=September 27, 2007 }} {{it icon}}).

According to popular legend, after his abjuration Galileo allegedly muttered the rebellious phrase [[And yet it moves|"and yet it moves" (Eppur si muove)]], but there is no evidence that he actually said this or anything similar. The first account of the legend dates to a century after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 356)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "Eppur si muove" does appear, however, in a painting of the 1640s by the Spanish painter [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]] or an artist of his school. The painting depicts an imprisoned Galileo apparently pointing to a copy of the phrase written on the wall of his dungeon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 357)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Torre del gallo.JPG|thumb|left|View of the [[Arcetri]] area in the hills above [[Florence]], where Galileo spent his life from 1634 onwards under house arrest.]]
After a period with the friendly Archbishop Piccolomini in [[Siena]], Galileo was allowed to return to his villa at [[Arcetri]] near Florence, where he spent the rest of his life under house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;On two occasions only during this period he was given permission to travel away from Arcetri. In October 1636 he was permitted to travel to [[Poggibonsi]] to meet the French ambassador to Rome, François de Noailles ([[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt,1994]], [https://books.google.com/books/about/Galileo.html?id=rB0rHzrpJOMC&amp;pg=PA184 p.184]; [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=507 1905, 16:507]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{it icon}}). In March 1638 he was permitted to travel to Florence for medical treatment, where he spent several months before returning to Arcetri ([[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt,1994]], [https://books.google.com/books/about/Galileo.html?id=rB0rHzrpJOMC&amp;pg=PA186 p.186]; [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=17&amp;VOLPAG=290 1905, 17:290,]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=17&amp;VOLPAG=310 310–11)]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{it icon}}).&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his work on mechanics, and in 1638 he published a scientific book in Holland. His standing would remain questioned at every turn. In March 1641, [[Vincentio Reinieri]], a follower and pupil of Galileo, wrote him at Arcetri that an Inquisitor had recently compelled the author of a book printed at [[Florence]] to change the words "most distinguished Galileo" to "Galileo, man of noted name".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.414)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, partially in tribute to Galileo, at Arcetri the first academy devoted to the new experimental science, [[Accademia del Cimento|the Accademia del Cimento]], was formed, which is where [[Francesco Redi]] performed [[controlled experiment]]s, and many other important advancements were made which would eventually help usher in [[The Age of Enlightenment]].

==Historiography==
There is some evidence that enemies of Galileo persuaded Urban that Simplicio was intended to be a caricature of him. Modern historians have dismissed this as most unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=zcDrMlJjlLoC&amp;pg=PA133 pp.133–134)], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966]], [https://archive.org/stream/GalileoGalileiHisLifeAndHisWorks/Seeger-GalileoGalileiHisLifeWorks#page/n41/mode/1up p.30)], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=OwOlRPbrZeQC&amp;pg=PA355 p.355)] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p.491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in ''[[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler book)|The Sleepwalkers]]'' [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says "this of course is untrue" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p.483)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dava Sobel]] argues that during this time, Urban had fallen under the influence of court intrigue and problems of state. His friendship with Galileo began to take second place to his feelings of persecution and fear for his own life. The problem of Galileo was presented to the pope by court insiders and enemies of Galileo, following claims by a Spanish cardinal that Urban was a poor defender of the church. This situation did not bode well for Galileo's defense of his book.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, Dava (2000, pp.223–225) [1999]. ''[[Galileo's Daughter]]''. London: Fourth Estate. {{ISBN|1-85702-712-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple authors have argued that the Catholic Church, rather than Galileo, was scientifically justified in the dispute over the placement and rotation of the sun and earth, given available knowledge at the time. Referring to Bellarmine's letter to Foscarini, physicist [[Pierre Duhem]] "suggests that in one respect, at least, Bellarmine had shown himself a better scientist than Galileo by disallowing the possibility of a 'strict proof of the earth's motion', on the grounds that an astronomical theory merely '[[Saving the phenomena|saves the appearances]]' without necessarily revealing what 'really happens'".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-McMullin-2008|McMullin (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1998 book, ''Scientific Blunders'', Robert Youngson indicates that Galileo struggled for two years against the ecclesiastical censor to publish a book promoting heliocentrism. He claims the book passed only as a result of possible idleness or carelessness on the part of the censor, who was eventually dismissed. On the other hand, Jerome K. Langford and [[Raymond J. Seeger]] contend that Pope Urban and the Inquisition gave formal permission to publish the book, ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, Ptolemaic &amp; Copernican]]''. They claim Urban personally asked Galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in the book, to include Urban's own arguments, and for Galileo not to advocate heliocentrism.

Some historians emphasize Galileo's confrontation not only with the church, but also with Aristotelian philosophy, either secular or religious.&lt;ref name="Speller2008"&gt;{{cite book |author= [[:lb:Jules Speller|Jules Speller]] |title= Galileo's Inquisition Trial Revisited |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jviElHq-kEcC |date=2008 |publisher= [[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]] |isbn= 978-3-631-56229-1 |pages= 55–56 |quote= Inside the Catholic domain, the first difficulties worth mentioning begin to arise when, toward the end of 1610 or the beginning of 1611, appears the manuscript of an essary written by Lodovico (or Ludovico) delle Colombe ''Contro il moto della terra''.

===Redondi's theory===

According to a controversial alternative theory proposed by Pietro Redondi in 1983, the main reason for Galileo's condemnation in 1633 was his attack on the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] doctrine of [[matter]] rather than his defence of Copernicanism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[#Reference-Redondi-1983|Redondi (1983)]].&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous denunciation, labeled "G3", discovered by Redondi in the Vatican archives, had argued that the atomism espoused by Galileo in his previous work of 1623, ''[[The Assayer]]'', was incompatible with the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] of the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;Redondi [[#Reference-Redondi-1983|(1983)]] attributed authorship of this document to [[Orazio Grassi]], the target of attacks by Galileo in ''The Assayer''. However, according to [[Sergio Pagano]] [[#Reference-Pagano-1984|(1984, p.44)]], a handwriting expert, Fr. Edmondo Lamalle, S.J., who compared its handwriting with that of contemporaneous documents known to have been written by Grassi, declared it "absolutely not sustainable" ("non è assolutamente sostenibile") that they could be of the same hand.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, investigation of this complaint was apparently entrusted to a Father Giovanni di Guevara, who was well-disposed towards Galileo, and who cleared ''The Assayer'' of any taint of unorthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Wallace-1991|Wallace (1991, pp.VII 81–83)]].&lt;/ref&gt; A similar attack against ''The Assayer'' on doctrinal grounds was penned by Jesuit [[Orazio Grassi]] in 1626 under the pseudonym "Sarsi". According to Redondi:
* The Jesuits, who had already linked ''The Assayer'' to allegedly heretical atomist ideas, regarded the ideas about matter expressed by Galileo in ''The Dialogue'' as further evidence that his atomism was heretically inconsistent with the doctrine of the Eucharist, and protested against it on these grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Redondi acknowledges that there are no surviving documents in which these protests were made explicit. His conclusions are based on complex inferences from indirect evidence.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pope Urban VIII]], who had been under attack by Spanish cardinals for being too tolerant of heretics, and who had also encouraged Galileo to publish ''The Dialogue'', would have been compromised had his enemies among the Cardinal Inquisitors been given an opening to comment on his support of a publication containing Eucharistic heresies.
* Urban, after banning the book's sale, established a commission to examine ''The Dialogue'',&lt;ref name=Youngson/&gt; ostensibly for the purpose of determining whether it would be possible to avoid referring the matter to the Inquisition at all, and as a special favor to Galileo's patron, the [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke of Tuscany]]. Urban's real purpose, though, was to avoid having the accusations of Eucharistic heresy referred to the Inquisition, and he stacked the commission with friendly commissioners who could be relied upon not to mention them in their report.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The commission reported against Galileo.&lt;ref name=Youngson/&gt;

Redondi's hypothesis concerning the hidden motives behind the 1633 trial has been criticized, and mainly rejected, by other Galileo scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Ferrone&amp;Firpo-1986|Ferrone and Firpo (1986)]] and [[#Reference-Westfall-1989|Westfall (1989, pp.58–93)]] provide comprehensive overviews of some of the criticisms that have been levelled at Redondi's theory. Briefer criticisms can be found in [[#Reference-Pagano-1984|Pagano (1984, pp.43–48)]], [[#Reference-Gosselin-1985|Gosselin (1985)]], [[#Reference-Westfall-1987|Westfall (1987)]], [[#Reference-Baumgartner-1989|Baumgartner (1989)]], [[#Reference-Drake-1990|Drake (1990, p.179—footnote)]], [[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|Blackwell (1991, pp.154–155, footnote 47)]], [[#Reference-Wallace-1991|Wallace (1991, pp.VII pp.67, 81–84)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p.149)]], [[#Reference-Artigas-2005|Artigas et al. (2005, pp.214, 222, 225–227)]], and [[#Reference-Beretta-2005b|Beretta (2005b, pp.192, 202–203)]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been supported recently {{when|date=September 2015}} by novelist and science writer [[Michael White (author)|Michael White]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-White-2007|White (2007)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Catholic Church views===

In 1758 the Catholic Church dropped the general prohibition of books advocating heliocentrism from the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Forbidden Books]]''.&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2005, p.307"&gt;[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|Heilbron (2005, p.307)]].&lt;/ref&gt; It did not, however, explicitly rescind the decisions issued by the Inquisition in its judgement of 1633 against Galileo, or lift the prohibition of uncensored versions of Copernicus's ''De Revolutionibus'' or Galileo's ''Dialogue''.&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2005, p.307"/&gt; The issue finally came to a head in 1820 when the Master of the Sacred Palace (the Church's chief censor), [[Filippo Anfossi]], refused to license a book by a Catholic canon, Giuseppe Settele, because it openly treated heliocentrism as a physical fact.&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2005, pp.279, 312"&gt;[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|Heilbron (2005, pp.279, 312–313)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Settele appealed to pope [[Pius VII]]. After the matter had been reconsidered by the Congregation of the Index and the Holy Office, Anfossi's decision was overturned.&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2005, pp.279, 312"/&gt; Copernicus's ''De Revolutionibus'' and Galileo's ''Dialogue'' were then subsequently omitted from the next edition of the ''Index'' when it appeared in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Finocchiaro ([[#CITEREFFinocchiaro2005|2005]], p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=IKW-4LyQeHYC&amp;pg=PA198 198])&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[Pope John Paul II]] expressed the hope that "theologians, scholars and historians, animated by a spirit of sincere collaboration, will study the Galileo case more deeply and in loyal recognition of wrongs, from whatever side they come."&lt;ref name="segre1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segre|first1=Michael|title=Light on the Galileo Case?|journal=Isis|date=1997|volume=88|issue=3|pages=484–504|doi=10.1086/383771}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pontifical Interdisciplinary Study Commission constituted in 1981 to study the case did not reach any definitive result. Because of this, the Pope’s 1992 speech that closed the project was vague, and did not fulfill his intentions expressed in 1979.&lt;ref name="segre1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segre|first1=Michael|title=Galileo: A ‘rehabilitation’ that has never taken place|journal=Endeavour|date=1999|volume=23|issue=1|pages=20–23|doi=10.1016/s0160-9327(99)01185-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 1990, in a speech delivered at [[Sapienza University of Rome|La Sapienza University]] in Rome,&lt;ref name=talklist&gt;An earlier version had been delivered on December 16, 1989, in Rieti, and a later version in Madrid on February 24, 1990 [[#Reference-Ratzinger-1994|(Ratzinger, 1994, p.81)]]. According to Feyerabend himself, Ratzinger had also mentioned him "in support of" his own views in a speech in Parma around the same time [[#Reference-Feyerabend-1995|(Feyerabend, 1995, p.178)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Ratzinger (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) cited some current views on the Galileo affair as forming what he called "a symptomatic case that illustrates the extent to which modernity’s doubts about itself have grown today in science and technology".&lt;ref name=self-doubt&gt;Ratzinger [[#Reference-Ratzinger-1994|(1994, p.98)]].&lt;/ref&gt; As evidence, he presented the views of a few prominent philosophers including [[Ernst Bloch]] and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], as well as [[Paul Feyerabend]], whom he quoted as saying:

{{Quote|The Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason than did Galileo himself, and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's teaching too. Her verdict against Galileo was rational and just, and the revision of this verdict can be justified only on the grounds of what is politically opportune.&lt;ref&gt;Ratzinger [[#Reference-Ratzinger-1994|(1994, p.98)]]. A partly browsable [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0898704618 on-line copy] of Ratzinger's text is available at Amazon.com. The page containing the quotation can be obtained by searching on a short extract. An alternative translation [http://ncrcafe.org/node/1541 (Allen, 2008)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515194016/http://ncrcafe.org/node/1541 |date=May 15, 2008 }} is also available on the web. However, Allen's attribution of his translation to a speech supposedly given by Ratzinger in Parma on March 15, 1990 contradicts the attribution given by his source—namely, Ratzinger's speech at La Sapienza on February 15.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ratzinger did not directly say whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions, but did say in this same context that "It would be foolish to construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views."&lt;ref name=self-doubt/&gt;

In 1992, it was reported that the [[Catholic Church]] had turned towards vindicating Galileo:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jB3ePe8DJuAC&amp;pg=169 Daniel N. Robinson citing John Paul II] in ''Human nature in its wholeness: a Roman Catholic perspective'' edited by D. N. Robinson, G. M. Sweeney and R. Gill, Front Cover&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
Thanks to his intuition as a brilliant physicist and by relying on different arguments, Galileo, who practically invented the experimental method, understood why only the sun could function as the centre of the world, as it was then known, that is to say, as a planetary system. The error of the theologians of the time, when they maintained the centrality of the Earth, was to think that our understanding of the physical world's structure was, in some way, imposed by the literal sense of Sacred Scripture....

In January 2008, students and professors protested the planned visit of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] to [[La Sapienza University]], stating in a letter that the pope's expressed views on Galileo "offend and humiliate us as scientists who are loyal to reason and as teachers who have dedicated our lives to the advance and dissemination of knowledge".&lt;ref name="Corriere della Sera"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Corriere della Sera (English edition) |title=Sapienza Academics Reject Pope’s University Address|date=2008-01-15|url=http://www.corriere.it/english/articoli/2008/01_Gennaio/15/papa.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response the pope canceled his visit.&lt;ref name="scupper"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7188860.stm|title=Papal visit scuppered by scholars|date=2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full text of the speech that would have been given was made available a few days following Pope Benedict's cancelled appearance at the university.&lt;ref name="La Sapienza speech"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Catholic World News|title=The speech Pope Benedict did not deliver|date=2008-01-19|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=56017&amp;repos=4&amp;subrepos=1&amp;searchid=1726409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebour was educated at the [[Royal School of Mines]] and was then a staff member of the [[British Geological Survey|Geological Survey]] from 1873 to 1876. At the [[Durham University|Durham College of Science]], he was a lecturer in geological surveying from 1876 to 1879 and then succeeded [[David Page (geologist)|David Page]] as professor of geology upon the latter's death in 1879. Lebour held this professorial chair until his own death in 1918.&lt;ref name=NatureObit/&gt;

He wrote ''Handbook to the Geology and Natural History of Northumberland and Durham'', which went through three editions from 1879 to 1889. He wrote more than 100 papers on carboniferous geology, thermal conductivity of rocks, and underground temperature. He was awarded the [[Murchison Medal]] in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lebour, George Alexander Louis|journal=Who's Who|year=1918|page= 1405|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3452406;view=1up;seq=1445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
A '''hip fracture''' is a  [[bone fracture|break]] that occurs in the upper part of the [[femur]] (thigh bone).&lt;ref name=AO2009&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00392|title=Hip Fractures|date=April 2009|website=OrthoInfo - AAOS|access-date=2017-09-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629225405/http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00392|archivedate=29 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms may include [[hip pain|pain around the hip]] particularly with movement and shortening of the leg.&lt;ref name=AO2009/&gt; Usually the person cannot walk.&lt;ref name=AFP2003/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
They most often occur as a result of a fall.&lt;ref name=AFP2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brunner|first1=LC|last2=Eshilian-Oates|first2=L|last3=Kuo|first3=TY|title=Hip fractures in adults|journal=American Family Physician|date=1 February 2003|volume=67|issue=3|pages=537–42|pmid=12588076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk factors include [[osteoporosis]], taking many medications, alcohol use, and [[metastatic cancer]].&lt;ref name=AO2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fer2018/&gt; Diagnosis is generally by [[radiography|X-ray]]s.&lt;ref name=AO2009/&gt; [[Magnetic resonance imaging]], a [[CT scan]], or a [[bone scan]] may occasionally be required to make the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=AFP2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=AO2009/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Pain management may occur with [[opioids]] or a [[nerve block]].&lt;ref name=Fer2018/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guay|first1=J|last2=Parker|first2=MJ|last3=Griffiths|first3=R|last4=Kopp|first4=SL|title=Peripheral Nerve Blocks for Hip Fractures: A Cochrane Review|journal=Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia|date=May 2018|volume=126|issue=5|pages=1695–1704|doi=10.1213/ANE.0000000000002489|pmid=28991122}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person's health is sufficient, surgery is generally recommended within two days.&lt;ref name=AO2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fer2018/&gt; Options for surgery may include a [[total hip replacement]] or screws.&lt;ref name=AO2009/&gt; Efforts to prevent [[deep vein thrombosis]] following surgery are recommended.&lt;ref name=Fer2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and prognosis --&gt;
About 15% of women break their hip at some point in their life.&lt;ref name=Fer2018/&gt; Women are more often affected than men.&lt;ref name=Fer2018/&gt; Hip fractures become more common with age.&lt;ref name=Fer2018/&gt; The risk of death in the year following a fracture is about 20% in older people.&lt;ref name=AFP2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fer2018/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Heupfractuur.jpg|thumb|the affected extremity is often shortened and unnaturally, externally rotated compared to the unaffected leg]]
The classic clinical presentation of a hip fracture is an elderly patient who sustained a low-energy fall and now has groin pain and is unable to bear weight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pain may be referred to the supracondylar knee. On examination, the affected extremity is often shortened and unnaturally, externally rotated compared to the unaffected leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/959649794|title=Current medical diagnosis &amp; treatment 2018|others=Papadakis, Maxine A.,, McPhee, Stephen J.,, Rabow, Michael W.,|isbn=9781259861482|edition=Fifty-seventh|location=New York|oclc=959649794|last1=Rabow|first1=Michael W|last2=McPhee|first2=Stephen J|last3=Papadakis|first3=Maxine A|date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==
Hip fracture following a fall is likely to be a [[pathologic fracture|pathological fracture]]. The most common causes of weakness in bone are:
* [[Osteoporosis]].
* [[Homocysteine]], a toxic 'natural' amino acid linked to the cause of [[heart disease]].
* Other metabolic bone diseases such as [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]], [[osteomalacia]], [[osteopetrosis]] and [[osteogenesis imperfecta]]. [[Stress fracture]]s may occur in the hip region with metabolic bone disease.
* Benign or malignant primary [[bone tumor]]s are rare causes of hip fractures.
* [[Metastasis|Metastatic]] cancer deposits in the proximal femur may weaken the bone and cause a pathological hip fracture.
* [[Osteomyelitis|Infection]] in the bone is a rare cause of hip fracture.
* Smoking (associated with osteoporosis).

==Mechanism==

[[File:Hueftgelenk-gesund.jpg|thumb|X-ray of a normal hip joint.|right|200px]]

===Functional anatomy===

The [[hip joint]], an enarthrodial joint, can be described as a ball and socket joint. The femur connects at the [[acetabulum]] of the pelvis and projects laterally before angling medially and inferiorly to form the knee. Although this joint has three [[degrees of freedom]], it is still stable due to the interaction of [[ligaments]] and [[cartilage]]. The [[Acetabular labrum|labrum]] lines the circumference of the [[acetabulum]] to provide stability and shock absorption. Articular cartilage covers the concave area of [[acetabulum]], providing more stability and shock absorption.  Surrounding the entire joint itself is a capsule secured by the tendon of the [[psoas muscle]] and three ligaments. The [[iliofemoral]], or Y, ligament is located anteriorly and serves to prevent hip [[hyperextension]]. The [[pubofemoral ligament]] is located anteriorly just underneath the [[iliofemoral ligament]] and serves primarily to resist [[abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]], [[extension (kinesiology)|extension]], and some [[external rotation]]. Finally the [[ischiofemoral ligament]] on the posterior side of the capsule resists [[extension (kinesiology)|extension]], [[adduction]], and [[internal rotation]]. When considering the biomechanics of [[hip fractures]], it is important to examine the mechanical loads the hip experiences during low energy falls.

===Biomechanics===

The [[hip joint]] is unique in that it experiences combined mechanical loads. An axial load along the shaft of the [[femur]] results in [[compressive stress]]. Bending load at the neck of the femur causes [[tensile stress]] along the upper part of the neck and [[compressive stress]] along the lower part of the neck. While [[osteoarthritis]] and [[osteoporosis]] are associated with [[bone fracture]] as we age, these diseases are not the cause of the fracture alone. Low energy falls from standing are responsible for the majority of fractures in the elderly, but fall direction is also a key factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hwang H. F. |author2=Lee H.

=== Neurological factors ===
Elderly individuals are also predisposed to hip fractures due to many factors that can compromise proprioception and balance, including medications, vertigo, stroke, and peripheral neuropathy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cumming|first=Robert G.|last2=Le Couteur|first2=David G.|date=2003|title=Benzodiazepines and risk of hip fractures in older people: a review of the evidence|journal=CNS Drugs|volume=17|issue=11|pages=825–837|issn=1172-7047|pmid=12921493|doi=10.2165/00023210-200317110-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakken|first=Marit Stordal|last2=Engeland|first2=Anders|last3=Engesæter|first3=Lars B.|last4=Ranhoff|first4=Anette Hylen|last5=Hunskaar|first5=Steinar|last6=Ruths|first6=Sabine|date=July 2013|title=Increased risk of hip fracture among older people using antidepressant drugs: data from the Norwegian Prescription Database and the Norwegian Hip Fracture Registry|journal=Age and Ageing|volume=42|issue=4|pages=514–520|doi=10.1093/ageing/aft009|issn=1468-2834|pmid=23438446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

=== Physical Exam ===
Displaced fractures of the trochanter or femoral neck will typically cause external rotation and shortening of the leg when the patient is laying supine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Imaging ===
Typically, radiographs are taken of the hip from the front (AP view), and side (lateral view). Frog leg views are to be avoided, as they may cause severe pain and further displace the fracture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In situations where a hip fracture is suspected but not obvious on x-ray, an MRI is the next test of choice. If an MRI is not available or the patient can not be placed into the scanner a CT may be used as a substitute. MRI sensitivity for radiographically occult fracture is greater than CT. Bone scan is another useful alternative however substantial drawbacks include decreased sensitivity, early false negative results, and decreased conspicuity of findings due to age related metabolic changes in the elderly.

As the patients most often require an operation, full pre-operative general investigation is required. This would normally include blood tests, ECG and chest x-ray.

==Prevention==
The majority of hip fractures are the result of a fall, particularly in the elderly.  Therefore, identifying why the fall occurred, and implementing treatments or changes,  is key to reducing the occurrence of hip fractures.  Multiple contributing factors are often identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Rubenstein|first = Laurence Z.|date = 2006-09-01|title = Falls in older people: epidemiology, risk factors and strategies for prevention|url = http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/suppl_2/ii37|journal = Age and Ageing|language = en|volume = 35|issue = suppl 2|pages = ii37–ii41|doi = 10.1093/ageing/afl084|pmid = 16926202|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160906054315/http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/suppl_2/ii37|archivedate = 6 September 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can include environmental factors and medical factors (such as postural hypotension or co-existing disabilities from disease such as [[Stroke]] or [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's Disease]] which cause visual and/or balance impairments).  A recent study has identified a high incidence of undiagnosed [[Myelopathy|cervical spondylotic myelopathy]] (CSM) amongst patients with a hip fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Radcliff|first = Kristen E.|last2 = Curry|first2 = E.

Additionally, there is some evidence to systems designed to offer protection in the case of a fall.  [[Hip protectors]], for example appear to decrease the number of hip fractures among the elderly.&lt;ref name="San2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Santesso|first1=N|last2=Carrasco-Labra|first2=A|last3=Brignardello-Petersen|first3=R|title=Hip protectors for preventing hip fractures in older people|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Mar 31, 2014|volume=3|issue=3|pages=CD001255|pmid=24687239|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001255.pub5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They; however, are not often used.&lt;ref name="San2014" /&gt;

==Management==
Most hip fractures are treated surgically by [[medical implant|implanting]] an [[orthosis]]. Surgical treatment outweighs the risks of nonsurgical treatment which requires extensive bedrest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Prolonged immobilization increases risk of thromboembolism, pneumonia, deconditioning, and decubitus ulcers. Regardless, the surgery is a major stress, particularly in the elderly. Pain is also significant, and can also result in immobilization, so patients are encouraged to become mobile as soon as possible, often with the assistance of [[physical therapy]]. [[Traction (orthopedics)|Skeletal traction]] pending surgery is not supported by the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Handoll|first=HH|author2=Queally, JM |author3=Parker, MJ |title=Pre-operative traction for hip fractures in adults|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=Dec 7, 2011|issue=12|pages=CD000168|pmid=22161361|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000168.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Regional nerve block]]s are useful for pain management in hip fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ritcey|first1=B|last2=Pageau|first2=P|last3=Woo|first3=MY|last4=Perry|first4=JJ|title=Regional Nerve Blocks For Hip and Femoral Neck Fractures in the Emergency Department: A Systematic Review|journal=CJEM|date=2 September 2015|pages=1–11|pmid=26330019|doi=10.1017/cem.2015.75|volume=18|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgery can be performed under general anaesthesia or with neuraxial techniques - choice is based on surgical and patient factors, as outcomes such as mortality and post-procedure complications including pneumonia, MI, stroke or confusion, are not affected by anaesthetic technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guay|first1=J|last2=Parker|first2=MJ|last3=Gajendragadkar|first3=PR|last4=Kopp|first4=S|title=Anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery in adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=22 February 2016|volume=2|pages=CD000521|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000521.pub3|pmid=26899415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blood transfusion|Red blood cell transfusion]] is common for people undergoing hip fracture surgery due to the blood loss sustained during surgery and from the injury. Giving blood when the hemoglobin is less than 10 g/dL versus less than 8 g/dL was of unclear benefit per a 2015 Cochrane review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brunskill|first1=SJ|last2=Millette|first2=SL|last3=Shokoohi|first3=A|last4=Pulford|first4=EC|last5=Doree|first5=C|last6=Murphy|first6=MF|last7=Stanworth|first7=S|title=Red blood cell transfusion for people undergoing hip fracture surgery|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=21 April 2015|volume=4|issue=4|pages=CD009699|pmid=25897628|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009699.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in 2018 however found that waiting until the hemoglobin was less than 8 g/dL or the person had symptoms increased the risk of heart problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gu |first1=WJ |last2=Gu |first2=XP |last3=Wu |first3=XD |last4=Chen |first4=H |last5=Kwong |first5=JSW |last6=Zhou |first6=LY |last7=Chen |first7=S |last8=Ma |first8=ZL |title=Restrictive Versus Liberal Strategy for Red Blood-Cell Transfusion: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis in Orthopaedic Patients |journal=The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

If operative treatment is refused or the risks of surgery are considered to be too high the main emphasis of treatment is on pain relief. Skeletal traction may be considered for long term treatment. Aggressive chest [[physiotherapy]] is needed to reduce the risk of [[pneumonia]] and skilled rehabilitation and nursing to avoid [[Bedsores|pressure sores]] and [[Deep vein thrombosis|DVT]]/[[pulmonary embolism]] Most people will be bedbound for several months. Non-operative treatment is now limited to only the most medically unstable or demented patients, or those who are nonambulatory at baseline with minimal pain during transfers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Surgery on the same day or day following the break is estimated to reduce postoperative mortality in people who are medically stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sobolev|first=Boris|last2=Guy|first2=Pierre|last3=Sheehan|first3=Katie Jane|last4=Kuramoto|first4=Lisa|last5=Sutherland|first5=Jason M.|last6=Levy|first6=Adrian R.|last7=Blair|first7=James A.|last8=Bohm|first8=Eric|last9=Kim|first9=Jason D.|date=2018-08-07|title=Mortality effects of timing alternatives for hip fracture surgery|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/190/31/E923|journal=CMAJ|language=en|volume=190|issue=31|pages=E923–E932|doi=10.1503/cmaj.171512|issn=0820-3946|pmid=30087128|pmc=6078777}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Intracapsular fractures===
[[File:Shf medial verschraubt crop.jpg|thumb|Fracture treated with [[cannulated screw]]s]]

For low-grade fractures (Garden types 1 and 2), standard treatment is fixation of the fracture in situ with screws or a sliding screw/plate device. This treatment can also be offered for displaced fractures after the fracture has been reduced.

Fractures managed by [[closed reduction]] can possibly be treated by percutaneously inserted screws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.aofoundation.org/wps/portal/!ut/p/a0/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfGjzOKN_A0M3D2DDbz9_UMMDRyDXQ3dw9wMDAzMjfULsh0VAbWjLW0!/?bone=Femur&amp;segment=Proximal&amp;showPage=D&amp;contentUrl=srg/popup/further_reading/PFxM2/31/661_32-Neck_fxs_surg_treat.jsp|title=Fractures of the femoral neck (31-B)|website=OA Foundation|author=Reinhard Hoffmann, Norbert P Haas|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427193030/https://www2.aofoundation.org/wps/portal/!ut/p/a0/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfGjzOKN_A0M3D2DDbz9_UMMDRyDXQ3dw9wMDAzMjfULsh0VAbWjLW0!/?bone=Femur&amp;segment=Proximal&amp;showPage=D&amp;contentUrl=srg%2Fpopup%2Ffurther_reading%2FPFxM2%2F31%2F661_32-Neck_fxs_surg_treat.jsp|archivedate=27 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}, citing: {{cite book|title=OA Principles of Fracture management|author=T.

In elderly patients with displaced or intracapsular fractures many surgeons prefer to undertake a [[hemiarthroplasty]], replacing the broken part of the bone with a metal implant. The advantage is that the patient can mobilize without having to wait for healing.

In elderly patients who are medically well and still active, a [[total hip replacement]] may be indicated.

Traction is contraindicated in femoral neck fractures due to it affecting blood flow to the head of the femur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli)) |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=978-0-07-148480-0 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trochanteric fracture===
[[File:Cdm hip implant 348.jpg|thumb|Fracture supported by [[dynamic hip screw]]]]

A trochanteric fracture, below the neck of the femur, has a good chance of healing.

[[Reduction (orthopedic surgery)|Closed reduction]] may not be satisfactory and [[Reduction (orthopedic surgery)|open reduction]] then becomes necessary.&lt;ref name=oa2017&gt;Subtypes of trochanteric fractures: {{cite web|url=https://www2.aofoundation.org/wps/portal/surgery?showPage=diagnosis&amp;bone=Femur&amp;segment=Proximal|title=Proximal femur|website=OA Foundation|author=Ernst Raaymakers, Inger Schipper, Rogier Simmermacher, Chris van der Werken|accessdate=2017-04-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424174524/https://www2.aofoundation.org/wps/portal/surgery?showPage=diagnosis&amp;bone=Femur&amp;segment=Proximal|archivedate=24 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of open reduction has been reported as 8-13% among pertrochanteric fractures, and 52% among intertrochanteric fractures.&lt;ref name="BoldinSeibert2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boldin|first1=Christian|last2=Seibert|first2=Franz J|last3=Fankhauser|first3=Florian|last4=Peicha|first4=Gerolf|last5=Grechenig|first5=Wolfgang|last6=Szyszkowitz|first6=Rudolf|title=The proximal femoral nail (PFN) - a minimal invasive treatment of unstable proximal femoral fractures: A prospective study of 55 patients with a follow-up of 15 months|journal=Acta Orthopaedica Scandinavica|volume=74|issue=1|year=2009|pages=53–58|doi=10.1080/00016470310013662|pmid=12635794}}
*This study cites the following primary source: &lt;br&gt;{{cite journal|author=Friedl W, Colombo-Benkmann M, Dockter S, et al.|title=Gammanagel-osteosynthes per- und subtrochanterer Femurfrakturen|journal=Chirurg|year=1994|volume=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both intertrochanteric and pertrochanteric fractures may be treated by a [[dynamic hip screw]] and plate, or an [[intramedullary rod]].&lt;ref name=oa2017/&gt;

The fracture typically takes 3–6 months to heal. As it is only common in elderly, removal of the [[dynamic hip screw]] is usually not recommended to avoid unnecessary risk of second operation and the increased risk of re-fracture after implant removal. The most common cause for hip fractures in the elderly is osteoporosis; if this is the case, treatment of the osteoporosis can well reduce the risk of further fracture. Only young patients tend to consider having it removed; the implant may function as a [[stress riser]], increasing the risk of a break if another accident occurs.

===Subtrochanteric fractures===
Subtrochanteric fractures may be treated with an [[intramedullary nail]] or a screw-plate construction and may require [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]] pre-operatively, though this practice is uncommon. It is unclear if any specific type of nail results in different outcomes than any other type of nail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Queally|first1=JM|last2=Harris|first2=E|last3=Handoll|first3=HH|last4=Parker|first4=MJ|title=Intramedullary nails for extracapsular hip fractures in adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Sep 12, 2014|volume=9|issue=9|pages=CD004961|pmid=25212485|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004961.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rehabilitation===
Rehabilitation has been proven to increase [[activities of daily living|daily functional status]]. It is unclear if the use of [[anabolic steroid]]s effects recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farooqi|first1=V|last2=van den Berg|first2=ME|last3=Cameron|first3=ID|last4=Crotty|first4=M|title=Anabolic steroids for rehabilitation after hip fracture in older people|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Oct 6, 2014|volume=10|issue=10|pages=CD008887|pmid=25284341|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008887.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is not enough evidence to ascertain what are the best strategies to promote walking after hip fracture surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Handoll|first=Helen Hg|last2=Sherrington|first2=Catherine|last3=Mak|first3=Jenson Cs|date=2011-03-16|title=Interventions for improving mobility after hip fracture surgery in adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=3|pages=CD001704|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001704.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=21412873|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-31802011000600012|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nutrition supplementation ===
Oral supplements with non-protein energy, protein, vitamins and minerals started before or early after surgery may prevent complications during the first year after hip fracture in aged adults; without seemingly effects on mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avenell|first=A|last2=Smith|first2=TO|last3=Curtain|first3=J|last4=Mak|first4=JCS|last5=Myint|first5=PK|title=Nutritional supplementation for hip fracture aftercare in older people|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|publication-date=30 November 2016|volume=11|pages=CD001880|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001880.pub6|pmid=27898998|year=2016|hdl=2164/9672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==
[[Nonunion]], failure of the fracture to heal, is common in fractures of the neck of the femur, but much more rare with other types of hip fracture. [[Avascular necrosis]] of the femoral head occurs frequently (20%) in intracapsular hip fractures, because the blood supply is interrupted.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/706805938|title=Essentials of musculoskeletal care|date=2010|publisher=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|others=Sarwark, John F.|isbn=9780892035793|location=Rosemont, Ill.|oclc=706805938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malunion]], healing of the fracture in a distorted position, is very common.  The thigh muscles tend to pull on the bone fragments, causing them to overlap and reunite incorrectly.  [[bone shortening|Shortening]], [[varus deformity]], [[valgus deformity]], and [[rotational malunion]] all occur often because the fracture may be unstable and collapse before it heals.  This may not be as much of a concern in patients with limited independence and mobility.

Hip fractures rarely result in [[neurological]] or [[Blood vessel|vascular]] injury.

===Surgical===
Deep or superficial wound infection has an approximate incidence of 2%. It is a serious problem as superficial infection may lead to deep infection. This may cause infection of the healing bone and contamination of the implants. It is difficult to eliminate infection in the presence of metal foreign bodies such as implants. Bacteria inside the implants are inaccessible to the body's defence system and to antibiotics. The management is to attempt to suppress the infection with drainage and antibiotics until the bone is healed. Then the implant should be removed, following which the infection may clear up.

Implant failure may occur; the metal screws and plate can break, back out, or cut out superiorly and enter the joint. This occurs either through inaccurate implant placement or if the fixation does not hold in weak and brittle bone. In the event of failure, the surgery may be redone, or changed to a [[total hip replacement]].

Mal-positioning: The fracture can be fixed and subsequently heal in an incorrect position; especially rotation. This may not be a severe problem or may require subsequent [[osteotomy]] surgery for correction.

===Medical===
Many people are unwell before breaking a hip; it is common for the break to have been caused by a [[Falling (accident)|fall]] due to some illness, especially in the elderly.  Nevertheless, the stress of the injury, and a likely surgery, increases the risk of medical illness including [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[cerebrovascular accident|stroke]], and [[pneumonia|chest infection]].

Hip fracture patients are at considerable risk for [[Venous thrombosis|thromboemoblism]], blood clots that dislodge and travel in the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Deep venous thrombosis]] (DVT) is when the blood in the leg veins clots and causes pain and swelling. This is very common after hip fracture as the circulation is stagnant and the blood is hypercoagulable as a response to injury. DVT can occur without causing symptoms.  A [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE) occurs when clotted blood from a DVT comes loose from the leg veins and passes up to the lungs. Circulation to parts of the lungs are cut off which can be very dangerous. Fatal PE may have an incidence of 2% after hip fracture and may contribute to illness and mortality in other cases.

[[Mental confusion]] is extremely common following a hip fracture. It usually clears completely, but the disorienting experience of pain, immobility, loss of independence, moving to a strange place, surgery, and drugs combine to cause [[delirium]] or accentuate pre-existing [[dementia]].

[[Urinary tract infection]] (UTI) can occur. Patients are immobilized and in bed for many days; they are frequently [[urinary catheterization|catheterised]], commonly causing infection.

Prolonged immobilization and difficulty moving make it hard to avoid [[bedsores|pressure sores]] on the sacrum and heels of patients with hip fractures. Whenever possible, early mobilization is advocated; otherwise, [[alternating pressure mattress]]es should be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/fractures_of_the_femoral_neck|title=Fractures of the Femoral Neck|website=Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics|publisher=[[Duke University School of Medicine]]|accessdate=27 January 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118043826/http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/fractures_of_the_femoral_neck|archivedate=18 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/intertrochanteric_fractures|title=Intertrochanteric Fractures|website=Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics|publisher=[[Duke University School of Medicine]]|accessdate=27 January 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118054018/http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/intertrochanteric_fractures|archivedate=18 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/63321.php |title=Damage Control Orthopaedics: Patient Stabilization, Early Mobilization |website=74th Annual Meeting of the [[American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons]] briefing |date=18 Feb 2007 |publisher=[[Medical News Today]] |accessdate=27 January 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122045136/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/63321.php |archivedate=22 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
Hip fractures are very dangerous episodes especially for elderly and frail patients. The risk of dying from the stress of the surgery and the injury in the first thirty days is about 10%. At one year after fracture this may reach 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sedlář M, Kvasnička J, Krška Z, Tománková T, Linhart A |title=Early and subacute inflammatory response and long-term survival after hip trauma and surgery |journal=[[Archives Gerontol.

Problems such as [[Bedsores|pressure sores]] and [[Pneumonia|chest infections]] are all increased by immobility. The prognosis of untreated hip fractures is very poor.

===Post operation===
Among those affected over the age of 65, 40% are transferred directly to long-term care facilities, long-term  rehabilitation facilities, or [[nursing home]]s; most of those affected require some sort of living assistance from family or home-care providers.  50% permanently require [[walker (tool)|walker]]s,  canes, or crutches for mobility; all require some sort of mobility assistance throughout the healing process. Most of the recovery of walking ability and activities of daily living occurs within 6 months of the fracture.&lt;ref name=Dyer2016&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dyer |first1=Suzanne M. |last2=Crotty |first2=Maria |last3=Fairhall |first3=Nicola |last4=Magaziner |first4=Jay |last5=Beaupre |first5=Lauren A. |last6=Cameron |first6=Ian D. |last7=Sherrington |first7=Catherine |title=A critical review of the long-term disability outcomes following hip fracture |journal=BMC Geriatrics |date=2 September 2016 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=158 |doi=10.1186/s12877-016-0332-0|pmid=27590604 |pmc=5010762 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fracture about half of older people recover their pre-fracture level of mobility and ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living, while 40–70 % regain their level of independence for basic activities of daily living.&lt;ref name=Dyer2016/&gt;

Among those affected over the age of 50, approximately 25% die within the next year due to complications such as [[thrombus|blood clots]] ([[deep venous thrombosis]], [[pulmonary embolism]]), [[infection]]s, and [[pneumonia]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Patients with hip fractures are at high risk for future fractures including hip, wrist, shoulder, and spine. After treatment of the acute fracture, the risk of future fractures should be addressed. Currently, only 1 in 4 patients after a hip fracture receives treatment and work up for osteoporosis, the underlying cause of most of the fractures. Current treatment standards include the starting of a [[bisphosphonate]] to reduce future fracture risk by up to 50%.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Falling is one of the most common risk factors for hip fractures. Approximately 90% of hip fractures are attributed to falls from standing height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cumming RG, Nevitt MC, Cummings SR | year = 1997 | title = Epidemiology of Hip Fractures | url = | journal = Epidemiology Review | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 244–257 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.epirev.a017956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with hip fractures and the cost to the health system, in England and Wales, the [[National Hip Fracture Database]] is a mandatory nationwide audit of care and treatment of all hip fractures.

===Population===

All populations experience hip fractures but numbers vary with race, gender, and age. Women suffer three times as many hip fractures as men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hip Fractures Among Older Adults|url=https://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Falls/adulthipfx.html|website=CDC|publisher=CDC|accessdate=13 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508103238/http://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Falls/adulthipfx.html|archivedate=8 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a lifetime, men have an estimated 6% risk whereas postmenopausal women have an estimated 14% risk of suffering a hip fracture.&lt;ref name=Lauritzen1997&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lauritzen JB | year = 1997 | title = Hip fractures: Epidemiology, risk factors, falls, energy absorption, hip protectors, and prevention | url = | journal = Dan Med Bull | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 155–168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These statistics provide insight over a lifespan and conclude that women are twice as likely to suffer a hip fracture. The overwhelming majority of hip fractures occur in white individuals while blacks and Hispanics have a lower rate of them. This may be due to their generally greater bone density and also because whites have longer overall lifespan and higher likelihood of reaching an advanced age where the risk of breaking a hip goes up.&lt;ref name=Lauritzen1997/&gt; Deprivation is also a key factor: in England it has been found that people in the poorest parts of the country are more likely to fracture a hip and less likely to recover well than those in the least deprived areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bardsley|first1=Martin|title=Focus on: Hip fracture|url=http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/focus-on/hip-fracture|website=QualityWatch|publisher=Nuffield Trust &amp; Health Foundation|accessdate=13 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515044225/http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/focus-on/hip-fracture|archivedate=15 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age related===

Age is the most dominant factor in hip fracture injuries, with most cases occurring in people over 75. The increase of age is related to the increase of the incidence of hip fracture,&lt;ref name=Kannus1996/&gt; which is the most frequent cause of hospitalization in centenarians, overcoming congestive heart failure and respiratory infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodríguez-Molinero|first1=Alejandro|last2=Yuste|first2=Antonio|last3=Banegas|first3=José Ramón|title=High incidence of hip fracture in Spanish centenarians|journal=J Am Geriatr Soc|date=2010|volume=58|issue=2|pages=403–5|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2009.02706.x|pmid=20370877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falls are the most common cause of hip fractures, around 30-60% of older adults fall each year. This increases the risk for hip fracture and leads to the increase risk of death in older individuals, the rate of one year [[mortality rate|mortality]] is seen from 12-37%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rubenstein LZ, Josephson KR | year = 2002 | title = The Epidemiology of Falls and Syncope | url = | journal = Clinic in Geriatrics Medicine | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 141–150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For those remaining patients who do not suffer from mortality, half of them need assistance and cannot live independently. Also, older adults sustain hip fractures because of [[osteoporosis]], which is a degenerative disease due to age and decrease in bone mass.  The average age for suffering a hip fracture is 77 years old for women and 72 years old for men.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgaertner MR, Higgins TF. (2002) Femoral Neck Fractures. Rockwood &amp; Green’s Fractures in Adults. 1579-1586&lt;/ref&gt; This shows how closely age is related to hip fractures.

[[File:Memorial to John James Hall in Exeter Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Memorial to John James Hall in the floor of the Syke Chantry in the north transept of [[Exeter Cathedral]] underneath the astronomical clock which he restored.]]
'''John James Hall''' FRAS (11 December 1845 &amp;ndash; 15 January 1941) was an eminent [[Horology|horologist]] and author who restored many early clocks.&lt;ref&gt;Monthly Notices of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]. Vol 102. p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

John James Hall spent his working life as an employee of the [[London and South Western Railway]] from 1865, but on retirement devoted his time to horology. He made over 200 contributions to ''The Horological Journal'', ''[[The English Mechanic and World of Science]]'', ''Watch and Clockmaker'' and other journals.

His best known accomplishments were the restoration of the fourteenth-century astronomical clocks in [[St Mary's Church, Ottery St Mary]] in 1907&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=London Ottregians.

He designed a new clock for Exeter Public Library which was set going in 1931. One of his major areas of study was the life and work of Jacob Lovelace of Exeter. He also published his complete articles in ''Fasces Exonienses''.

He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] on 10 February 1899. He was also a Fellow of the [[British Horological Institute]], the [[Royal Meteorological Society|Meteorological Society]], the [[National Geographic Society]] of Washington, and the [[:fr:Société royale belge d'astronomie|Societe d’Astronomie et du Physique du Globe, Bruxelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Noted Horologist.

'''Joseph Finnegan''' (April 12, 1905 &amp;ndash; September 8, 1980) was an [[United States|American]] [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]] with [[Station Hypo]] during the [[Second World War]].

==War contribution==
In 2002, [[Tex Biard]] described Finnegan as "intuitive" and "brilliant", and second only to Station Hypo chief [[Joseph J. Rochefort]], saying that Finnegan's survival of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing]] of the ''[[USS Tennessee (BB-43)|USS Tennessee]]'' was a "fatal mistake" on the part of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]], and that Finnegan's survival "cost (the Japanese) the war."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usspennsylvania.com/TheDungeon.htm Transcript of Tex Biard's 2002 speech] at USSPennsylvania.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edwin T. Layton]], in his book "''And I Was There:  Pearl Harbor and Midway -- Breaking the Secrets''" (1985) recounts a tremendous effort by Finnegan on the Hypo team concerning the exact date on which the attack on Midway would occur.  This involved the date-time groups in Japanese naval messages.

Layton refers to the date-time data as being “superenciphered,” meaning that this data was preencoded even before it was added to the [[JN-25]] cipher.  When Hypo made their all-out effort to crack this, they started by searching the stacks of printouts and [[punched cards]] for five-digit number sequences.  Those they found were in low grade codes, a poor starting point, but a starting point.

{{Cquote| Next they had to unravel the cipher itself.  It was Lieutenant Joseph Finnegan, a linguist-cryptanalyst, who finally hit upon the method that the Japanese had used to lock up their date-time groups.}}

Layton describes this method as "involving a 12 x 31 (12 rows for months, 31 columns for day) garble check.  The 31 kana [Japanese syllabic scripts] of the first row were A, I, U, E, O, KA, KI …………….HA, HI, HU, HE, HO.  The second row was I, U, E, O ……………HE, HO, A; the third, U, E, O ……….HO, A, I, and so on, for 12 rows.  At the left, representing the 12 months, was a column of 12 kana, different from those in the table – SA, AI, SU, SE, SO, TA, TI, TU, TE, TO, NA, NI (SA for January, NI for December).  To encipher, for example 27 May, one picked the 5th line (May=SO), ran across to the twenty-seventh column, HA, and recorded the kana at that intersection, HO.  The encipherment, then, was SO, HA, HO, the third kana providing the garble check." (Layton, pp.&amp;nbsp;427–428)

The [[Abell catalogue]] is a catalogue of approximately 4,000 [[galaxy cluster]]s with at least 30 members, almost complete to a [[redshift]] of ''z'' = 0.2. It was originally compiled by the American astronomer [[George O. Abell]] in 1958 using plates from [[National Geographic Society – Palomar Observatory Sky Survey|POSS]], and extended to the southern hemisphere by Abell, [[Harold Corwin|Corwin]]  and [[Ronald Olowin|Olowin]] in 1987. The name "Abell" is also commonly used as a designation for objects he compiled in a catalogue of 86 [[planetary nebula]]e in 1966. The proper designation for the galaxy clusters is ACO, as in "ACO 13", while the planetary-nebula designation is the single letter A, as in "A 39".

==Analogue controls==
Several jurisdictions have implemented [[Federal Analogue Act|analogue law]] controls of fentanyl analogues in an attempt to pre-emptively ban novel derivatives before they appear on the market. One representative example is the New Zealand provisions enacted in 1988 in response to the first wave of fentanyl derivatives. This bans a set of structures as follows;

"Fentanyl analogues, in which the N-[1-(2-phenethyl)-4-piperidyl]aniline nucleus has additional radicals, either alone or in combination, attached as follows:

(a) an acetyl, propionyl, butenoyl or butanoyl radical, attached to the aniline nitrogen atom:

(b) 1 or more alkyl radicals, with up to 10 carbon atoms in total, attached to the ethyl moeity:

(c) any combination of up to 5 alkyl radicals and/or alkoxy radicals (each with up to 6 carbon atoms, including cyclic radicals) and/or halogen radicals, attached to each of the benzene rings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1975/0116/latest/DLM436723.html | work = New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 | title = Schedule 3 Class C Controlled Drugs; Part 7: Fentanyl analogues }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent and somewhat broader example was introduced into US Federal legislation in 2018, covering the following structures;

"...fentanyl-related substances includes any substance not otherwise controlled in any schedule...that is structurally related to fentanyl by one or more of the following modifications:

# Replacement of the phenyl portion of the phenethyl group by any monocycle, whether or not further substituted in or on the monocycle;
# substitution in or on the phenethyl group with alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyl, hydroxyl, halo, haloalkyl, amino or nitro groups;
# substitution in or on the piperidine ring with alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyl, ester, ether, hydroxyl, halo, haloalkyl, amino or nitro groups;
# replacement of the aniline ring with any aromatic monocycle whether or not further substituted in or on the aromatic monocycle; and/or
# replacement of the N-propionyl group by another acyl group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/06/2018-02319/schedules-of-controlled-substances-temporary-placement-of-fentanyl-related-substances-in-schedule-i | work = United States Federal Register | title = Schedules of Controlled Substances: Temporary Placement of Fentanyl-Related Substances in Schedule I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lunar Landing Research Facility''' was an area at NASA's [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]] that was used to simulate [[Apollo program|Apollo Moon landings]] with a mock [[Lunar Module]] powered by a small rocket motor suspended from a crane over a simulated lunar landscape.

Completed in 1965 at a cost of $3.5 million, the facility was used by 24 astronauts, including [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]], to practice solving piloting problems they would encounter in the last 150 feet of descent to the surface of the Moon.&lt;ref name="crgis.ndc.nasa.gov"&gt;[http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/historic/1297 NASA Impact Dynamics Research Facility]&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure was used to facilitate "flying" a full-scale Lunar Excursion Module Simulator (LEMS). The LEMS was suspended from a {{convert|200|ft|m|sing=on}}-tall, {{convert|400|ft|m|sing=on}}-long A-frame gantry by an overhead bridge crane.  The LEMS is now on display at the [[Virginia Air and Space Center]].

==Post-Apollo uses==

Re-designated the '''Impact Dynamics Research Facility''' (IDRF) in 1974, the site was used for research on aircraft crashes until 2003. With limited funding for maintenance, NASA then closed the facility and it was listed for demolition.&lt;ref name="crgis.ndc.nasa.gov"/&gt;

In 2004, NASA determined that the IDRF could be adapted to support the Constellation program. It was re-opened in 2005 to conduct landing tests associated with the development of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) ''Orion''.  The facility was renamed the '''Landing and Impact Research Facility''' (LandIR) and minor modifications were made, including a new parallel winch system to support full-scale ''Orion'' testing and a new hydro-impact basin (splashdown pool) below the gantry. Construction of the basin was completed in 2011.  After Constellation was cancelled, the LandIR continued performing impact testing since the CEV will be used to service the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name="crgis.ndc.nasa.gov"/&gt;

The facility was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1985 for its role in the space program.

A '''motion picture content rating system''' is designated to [[Content rating|classify films]] with regard to suitability for audiences in terms of issues such as sex, violence, substance abuse, profanity, impudence or other types of mature content. A particular issued rating can be called a '''certification''', '''classification''', '''certificate''' or '''rating'''. Ratings typically carry age recommendations in an advisory or restrictive capacity, and are often given in lieu of [[censorship]]. In some jurisdictions the legal obligation of administering the rating may be imposed on [[movie theater]]s.

In countries such as Australia and Singapore, an official government body decides on ratings; in other countries, such as the United States, it is done by industry committees with little if any official government status. In most countries, however, films that are considered morally offensive have been censored, restricted, or banned. Even if the film rating system has no legal consequences, and a film has not explicitly been restricted or banned, there are usually laws forbidding certain films, or forbidding minors to view them.

The influence of specific factors in deciding a rating varies from country to country. In countries such as the United States, films with strong sexual content tend to be restricted to older viewers, though those same films are very often considered suitable for all ages in countries such as France and Germany. In contrast, films with violent content which would be rated leniently in the United States and Australia are often subject to high ratings and sometimes even censorship in countries such as Germany and Finland.

Other factors may or may not influence the classification process, such as being set within a [[non-fictional]] historical context, whether the film glorifies violence or drug use, whether said violence or drug use is carried out by the protagonist, with whom the viewer should empathize, or by the antagonist. In Germany, for example, films depicting explicit war violence in a real war context (such as the Second World War) are handled more leniently than films with purely fictional settings.

A film may be produced with a particular rating in mind. It may be [[Re-edited film|re-edited]] if the desired rating is not obtained, especially to avoid a higher rating than intended. A film may also be re-edited to produce an alternate version for other countries.

* Advisory categories
** General ('''G''') – ''General''. The content is very mild in impact. The G classification is suitable for everyone.
** Parental Guidance ('''PG''') – ''Parental guidance recommended''. The content is mild in impact. It is not recommended for viewing or playing by persons under 15 without guidance from parents or guardians.
** Mature ('''M''') – ''Recommended for mature audiences''. The content is moderate in impact. Children under 15 may legally access this material because it is an advisory category. However, M classified films and computer games may include classifiable elements such as violence and nudity of moderate impact that are not recommended for children under 15 years.
* Restricted categories
** Mature Accompanied ('''MA15+''') – ''Not suitable for people under 15. Under 15s must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian''. The content is strong in impact.
** Restricted ('''R18+''') – ''Restricted to 18 years and over''. The content is high in impact. Despite this category being legally restricted, in Queensland the restriction is not applicable to persons under 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.classification.gov.au/Industry/Journey/Documents/Resources/CLS%20-%20Cinema%20Managers%20Factsheet%20-%20December%2012%20update.pdf |title=CLS - Cinema Managers Factsheet - December 12 update |publisher=Australian Classification Board |location=Australia |language=English |format=PDF |publication-date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adult film categories
** Restricted ('''X18+''') – ''Restricted to 18 years and over''. This classification is a special and legally restricted category which contains only sexually explicit content. That is, material which shows actual sexual intercourse and other sexual activity between consenting adults. X18+ films are only available for sale or hire in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.
** '''RC''' – ''Refused Classification''. Banned from sale or hire in Australia and cannot be legally imported. Films are rated RC if their content is very high in impact and exceeds the guidelines.

Films intended to inform, educate or instruct or concerned with sport, religion or music are exempt from classification provided they do not contain material that would result in an "M" rating or higher if submitted for classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is it exempt? |publisher=Australian Classification Board |url=http://www.classification.gov.au/Industry/Journey/Pages/Exemptions/Step1.aspx |accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motion pictures are rated by the Austrian Board of Media Classification (ABMC) for the [[Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture]] (Bundesministerium für Unterricht, Kunst und Kultur). The recommendations made by the ABMC are generally not legally binding and there are nine sets of state laws on the cinema sector with different age provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Austrian Board of Media Classification |publisher=[[Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture]] |location=Vienna |url=http://www.bmukk.gv.at/medienpool/17350/abmc.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528010006/http://www.bmukk.gv.at/medienpool/17350/abmc.pdf |archivedate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only exception is in the case of "16" rated films, since under Austrian law there is a legal age restriction on certain types of content i.e. discrimination, sexual abuse, glorification of violence etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Age Rating of Movies and Similar Image Carriers by the Austrian Youth Media Commission |work=Jugend Medien Kommission |publisher=[[Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture]] |location=Vienna |url=http://www.bmukk.gv.at/medienpool/17349/jmk_agerating.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528010429/http://www.bmukk.gv.at/medienpool/17349/jmk_agerating.pdf |archivedate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the ABMC's age recommendations, in the state of Vienna children under the age of 6 are only permitted to attend public film performances if they are accompanied.&lt;ref name="EC (1997)"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[University of Oxford]] PCMLP |title=Study on Parental Control of Television Broadcasting |chapter=Annex 2: Comparative Analysis of Rating System – Cinema Rating Systems |year=1997 |publisher=[[European Commission]]  |page=113 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/archives/information_society/avpolicy/docs/library/studies/finalised/parental_control/annexe2.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AMBC issues age recommendation from the following categories:
*'''Unrestricted''' – Released for all age groups
*'''6+''' – Released for children from age 6
*'''10+''' – Released for children from age 10
*'''12+''' – Released for children from age 12

There are only two classifications for films publicly exhibited in Belgium issued by the Inter-Community Commission for Film Rating ({{lang-nl|Intergemeenschapscommissie voor de Filmkeuring}}; {{lang-fr|Commission Intercommunautaire de Contrôle des Films}}). Films are prohibited to minors under the age of 16 unless passed by the commission. There is no mandatory rating system for video formats but 90% of video distribution abides by the voluntary Belgium Video Federation. It is basically the same as the system for theatrical exhibition, but also provides a "12" rating.&lt;ref name="EC (2003)"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Olsberg SPI |author2=KEA European Affairs |author3=KPMG |title=Empirical Study on the Practice of the Rating of Films Distributed in Cinemas Television DVD and Videocassettes in the EU and EEA Member States |date=May 2003 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |chapter=Appendix 1 Country Profiles |page=125 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/avpolicy/docs/library/studies/finalised/studpdf/rating_annex2.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''18: Não recomendado para menores de dezoito anos''' (Not recommended for minors under eighteen): Restricted to adults. Scenes featuring explicit sex, incest, pedophilia, praising of the use of illegal drugs and violence of a strong imagery impact.

There are also operational descriptions of attenuating and aggravating elements that can interfere on the final rating.

{{Main article|Canadian motion picture rating system|Canadian Home Video Rating System}}
Film ratings in Canada are a provincial responsibility, and each province has its own legislation, rules and regulations regarding rating, exhibition and admission. Ratings are required for theatrical exhibition, but not all provinces require classification for home video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Film Ratings – Theatrical Classification |publisher=[[Motion Picture Association – Canada]] |url=http://www.mpa-canada.org/theatrical-classification/ |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past there was a wide range of rating categories and practices in the various provinces; however, the seven rating systems—with the exception of Quebec—now all use categories and logos derived from the [[Canadian Home Video Rating System]] (CHVRS).&lt;ref name="canada classification boards"&gt;{{cite web |title=Film Classification Boards |publisher=[[Motion Picture Association – Canada]] |url=http://www.cmpda.ca/?q=content/film-classification-boards |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523033902/http://www.cmpda.ca/?q=content%2Ffilm-classification-boards |archivedate=23 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FSK Ratings Dec 2008.gif|thumb|right|The Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft (FSK) ratings.]]
The [[Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft]] (Voluntary Self-Regulation of the Film Industry, FSK) has a film ratings system under which films are classified. All the ratings contain the phrase "gemäß §14 JuSchG" (in accordance with §14 of the Youth Protection Law), signifying that they are legally binding for minors. Cinemas may legally exhibit films without a classification but minors are prohibited from such screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alterseinstufungen und FSK-Kennzeichen |language=German |trans-title=Age ratings and FSK mark |publisher=Spitzenorganisation der Filmwirtschaft |location=Germany |url=http://www.spio.de/index.asp?SeitID=508&amp;TID=72 |accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Ohne Altersbeschränkung (FSK 0)''': no age restriction (white sign)
* '''Freigegeben ab 6 Jahren (FSK 6)''': released to ages 6 and older, nobody under this age admitted (yellow sign)
* '''Freigegeben ab 12 Jahren (FSK 12)''': released to ages 12 and older; children who are at least age 6 may be admitted with parental accompaniment (green sign)
* '''Freigegeben ab 16 Jahren (FSK 16)''': released to ages 16 and older, nobody under this age admitted (blue sign)
* '''Keine Jugendfreigabe (FSK 18)''': "''no youth admitted''", adults only. (red sign)
* '''Infoprogramm''' or '''Lehrprogramm''': "educational programming". This rating is not issued by the FSK, but may be self-applied to films seeking to educate their audience (e.g. documentaries, instructional films, etc.). Films with this rating may be sold without any age restriction provided they do not contain any material "evidently harmful to the development of children and youths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Informationsblatt zum neuen Jugendschutzgesetz ab 01.04.2003 |language=German |trans-title=Information sheet about the new Youth Protection Act from 01.04.2003 |date=1 April 2003 |publisher=Spitzenorganisation der Filmwirtschaft |location=Germany |url=http://www.spio.de/media_content/555.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSK rating also limits the time of the day in which the movie may be aired on free-to-air TV stations to a time frame between 22:00 (FSK 16) or 23:00 (FSK 18) and 6:00. Stations are permitted to broadcast films not approved for audiences under 12 at their own discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gültigkeit der FSK-Kennzeichen für das Fernsehen – Sendezeitschienen |language=German |trans-title=Validity of the G-mark for television – Airtime rails |publisher=Spitzenorganisation der Filmwirtschaft |location=Germany |url=http://www.spio.de/index.asp?SeitID=1295&amp;TID=72 |accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, film censorship in Malaysia was carried out by police under the Theatre Ordinance 1908. In 1954 the [[Film Censorship Board of Malaysia|Film Censorship Board]] (LPF) was created to censor films distributed across Malaysia in accordance with the Cinematograph Films Act 1952, and later the Film Censorship Act 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Censorship Board – Introduction|url=http://www.moha.gov.my/index.php/en/lpf-pengenalan|publisher=[[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Ministry of Home Affairs]]|location=Malaysia|accessdate=20 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822011400/http://www.moha.gov.my/index.php/en/lpf-pengenalan|archivedate=22 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia's motion picture rating system was introduced in 1953, initially classifying films either for General Audiences (''Tontonan Umum'') or For Adults Only (''Untuk Orang Dewasa Sahaja''), and in 1996 these classifications were changed to U and four different 18 categories. In mid-April 2010, the four 18 categories were deprecated, and was simplified to just '''18'''. In late 2008, the PG13 classification was introduced, which was changed to P13 in 2012.&lt;ref name="Malaysia ratings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Censorship Board – Film Classification|url=http://www.moha.gov.my/index.php/en/lpf-klasifikasi-filem|publisher=[[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Ministry of Home Affairs]]|location=Malaysia|accessdate=20 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113035653/http://www.moha.gov.my/index.php/en/lpf-klasifikasi-filem|archivedate=13 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poland==
Ratings in Poland are not set by any board or advisory body. Prior to 1989 the applicable age ratings were "no age limit", "over 7", "over 12", "over 15" and "over 18" and were set by The General Committee of Cinematography. Since 1989 there is no official classification system, with age ratings being self-prescriptive and set by the distributors. In case of television, the supervisory body – [[Krajowa Rada Radiofonii i Telewizji]] (KRRiT, The National Council of Radio Broadcasting and Television) can impose fines upon those responsible for improper rating of a broadcast, or lack of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Lucyna |last=Kirwil |title=Age or Content Based Film Ratings: A Solution Discussed in Poland |date=3–5 September 2003 |conference=European Conference of Film Classification |publisher=Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle Fernsehen |url=http://fsf.de/data/hefte/pdf/Veranstaltungen/Archiv/2003_European_Conference/poland_abstract_ppp_.pdf |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film classification in Singapore was introduced on 1 July 1991 and comes under the jurisdiction of the Board of Film Censors (BFC), currently part of the [[Info-communications Media Development Authority]] (IMDA). There were three ratings originally: G (General), PG (Parental Guidance) and R (Restricted to 18 years and above). Prior to then films were either approved or effectively banned. Since then, there have been several alterations to the ratings over the years. In September 1991, a Restricted (Artistic) (R(A)) rating was introduced to replaced the previous R-rating so as to allow the screening of certain art-house films which would otherwise have been banned without said rating, with an increased age restriction set at 21 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_15_2004-12-27.html&lt;/ref&gt; The R(A) rating has since been replaced by NC16 (No Children under 16), M18 (Mature 18) and R21 (Restricted 21). A PG13 (Parental Guidance 13) rating, introduced in 2011, is the latest rating to be introduced. The G, PG and PG13 ratings are advisory while NC16, M18 and R21 carry age restrictions. Video ratings are mostly the same as the cinema ratings, except only go up to M18. Some titles, such as documentaries, children's programmes and sports programmes may be exempt from classification on video, but all titles must be classified for public theatrical exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regulations &amp; Licensing: Content Standards &amp; Classification – Film &amp; Videos |publisher=[[Media Development Authority]] |location=Singapore |url=http://www.mda.gov.sg/RegulationsAndLicensing/ContentStandardsAndClassification/FilmsAndVideos/Pages/default.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315080305/http://www.mda.gov.sg/RegulationsAndLicensing/ContentStandardsAndClassification/FilmsAndVideos/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Board of Film Censors|title=Classification Guidelines |publisher=[[Media Development Authority]] |location=Singapore |url=http://www.mda.gov.sg/RegulationsAndLicensing/ContentStandardsAndClassification/Documents/Films%20and%20Videos/Classification_Guidelines_15072011.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724013050/http://www.mda.gov.sg/RegulationsAndLicensing/ContentStandardsAndClassification/Documents/Films%20and%20Videos/Classification_Guidelines_15072011.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A motion picture rating system was proposed in the Film and Video Act of 2007, and was passed on December 20, 2007 by the [[Council for National Security|Thai military]]-appointed [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Legislative Assembly]], replacing laws which had been in place since 1930. The draft law was met with resistance from the film industry and independent filmmakers. Activists had hoped for a less-restrictive approach; however, films are still subject to censorship, or can be banned from release altogether if the film is deemed to "undermine or disrupt social order and moral decency, or might impact national security or the pride of the nation".&lt;ref name=Rithdee&gt;{{cite news |last=Rithdee |first=Kong |title=Thailand passes controversial film act |date=20 December 2007 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/thailand-passes-controversial-film-act-1117978081 |accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Turkey, movies to be shown in cinemas are rated by the Evaluation and Classification Board of the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism]]. All films to be made commercially available must be classified, except in the case of educational films which are labeled as "for educational purposes" instead. The board also has the power to refuse classification in extreme cases (producers and distributors can submit an edited version of a movie to the board but edited versions may also be rejected if still deemed inappropriate); in this case, the movie will be banned with the exception of special artistic activities like fairs, festivals, feasts and carnivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sinema Filmlerinin Değerlendirilmesi ve Sınıflandırılmasına İlişkin Usul ve Esaslar Hakkında Yönetmelik |trans-title=Evaluation and Classification of Movies Regulation on the Procedures and Principles |date=18 February 2005 |work=Official Gazette |issue=25 731 |page=6 |publisher=[[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] |location=Turkey |language=Turkish |url=http://teftis.kulturturizm.gov.tr/TR,14493/sinema-filmlerinin-degerlendirilmesi-ve-siniflandirilma-.html |accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sinema Filmlerini Değerlendirme Ve Sınıflandırma İşaretlerimizi Tanıyalım |trans-title=Meet the assessment and classification Sign Cinema Films |publisher=[[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] |location=Turkey |url=http://www.telifhaklari.gov.tr/belge/1-77841/sinema-filmlerini-Degerlendirme.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109085537/http://www.telifhaklari.gov.tr/belge/1-77841/sinema-filmlerini-Degerlendirme.html |archivedate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BBFC ratings.JPG|thumb|right|UK film classification certificates. Uc is deprecated.]]
The [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) classifies films to be publicly exhibited in the United Kingdom, although statutory powers remain with local councils which can overrule any of the BBFC's decisions. Since 1984, the BBFC also classifies films made commercially available though a home video format. If the BBFC refuses a classification this effectively amounts to a ban (although local councils retain the legal right to overturn it in the case of cinema exhibition). The BBFC's regulatory powers do not extend to the Internet, so a film they have banned on physical media can still be made available via [[streaming media]]/[[video on demand]]. Videos designed to inform, educate or instruct or concerned with sport, religion or music are exempt from classification; exempt films may be marked as "E", but this is not an official label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the BBFC |publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/about-bbfc |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQs |publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/about-bbfc/faqs |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''U (Universal)''' - Suitable for all. A U-rated film should be suitable for audiences aged four years and over.
* '''PG (Parental Guidance)''' - General viewing, but some scenes may be unsuitable for young children. A PG-rated film should not unsettle a child aged around eight or older.
* '''12A''' - Cinema release suitable for 12 years and over. No one younger than 12 may see a 12A-rated film in a cinema unless accompanied by an adult.
* '''12''' – Video release suitable for 12 years and over. Video recordings with this rating are not to be supplied to anyone below that age even if under supervision.
* '''[[15 (British Board of Film Classification)|15]]''' - Suitable only for 15 years and older. No-one under 15 is allowed to see a 15-rated film at the cinema or buy/rent a 15-rated video.
* '''[[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18]]''' - Suitable only for adults. No-one under 18 is allowed to see an 18-rated film at the cinema or buy/rent an 18-rated video. 
* '''[[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18 (Restricted 18)]]''' - Adult works for licensed premises only. The R18 category is a special and legally restricted classification primarily for explicit works of consenting sex or strong fetish material involving adults. Films may only be shown to adults in specially licensed cinemas, and video works may be supplied to adults only in licensed sex shops. R18-rated video works may not be supplied by mail order.

'''Nanoelectromechanical systems''' ('''NEMS''') are a class of devices integrating electrical and mechanical functionality on the [[Nanoscopic scale|nanoscale]]. NEMS form the logical next miniaturization step from so-called [[microelectromechanical systems]], or MEMS devices. NEMS typically integrate transistor-like [[nanoelectronics]] with mechanical actuators, pumps, or motors, and may thereby form physical, biological, and [[chemical sensors]]. The name derives from typical device dimensions in the [[nanometer]] range, leading to low mass, high mechanical resonance frequencies, potentially large [[quantum mechanical]] effects such as [[Quantum harmonic oscillator|zero point motion]], and a high surface-to-volume ratio useful for surface-based sensing mechanisms.&lt;ref name = Ventra2004&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Nanoscale Science and Technology (Nanostructure Science and Technology) |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |date=2004|isbn=1-4020-7720-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mccEGiaPEJwC|author1 = Hughes, James E. Jr.|author2 = Ventra, Massimiliano Di |author3 = Evoy, Stephane |authorlink2 = Massimiliano Di Ventra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uses include [[accelerometer]]s, or detectors of [[chemical substance]]s in the air.

==Overview==
As noted by [[Richard Feynman]] in his famous talk in 1959, "[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]," there are many potential applications of machines at smaller and smaller sizes; by building and controlling devices at smaller scales, all technology benefits.  Among the expected benefits include greater efficiencies and reduced size, decreased power consumption and lower costs of production in electromechanical systems.&lt;ref name = Ventra2004/&gt;

In 2000, the first [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) NEMS device was demonstrated by researchers at IBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0924-4247(99)00254-X|title=VLSI-NEMS chip for parallel AFM data storage|date=2000|last1=Despont|first1=M|journal=Sensors and Actuators A: Physical|volume=80|issue=2|pages=100–107|last2=Brugger|first2=J.|last3=Drechsler|first3=U.|last4=Dürig|first4=U.|last5=Häberle|first5=W.|last6=Lutwyche|first6=M.|last7=Rothuizen|first7=H.|last8=Stutz|first8=R.|last9=Widmer|first9=R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its premise was an array of AFM tips which can heat/sense a deformable substrate in order to function as a memory device.  Further devices have been described by Stefan de Haan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Haan|first1=S.|journal=Nanotechnology Perceptions|volume=2|issue=3|date=2006|pages=267–275|issn=1660-6795|doi=10.4024/N14HA06.ntp.02.03|title=NEMS—emerging products and applications of nano-electromechanical systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the International Technical Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itrs.net/ ITRS Home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228041321/http://www.itrs.net/ |date=2015-12-28 }}. Itrs.net. Retrieved on 2012-11-24.&lt;/ref&gt; contains NEMS Memory as a new entry for the Emerging Research Devices section.

==Atomic force microscopy==
A key application of NEMS is [[atomic force microscopy|atomic force microscope]] tips.  The increased sensitivity achieved by NEMS leads to smaller and more efficient sensors to detect stresses, vibrations, forces at the atomic level, and chemical signals.&lt;ref name = Evoy2004&gt;{{cite book|author1=Massimiliano Ventra|author2=Stephane Evoy|author3=James R. Heflin|title=Introduction to Nanoscale Science and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtLHbR62xIUC|accessdate=24 November 2012|date=30 June 2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-7720-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; AFM tips and other detection at the nanoscale rely heavily on NEMS.

==Approaches to miniaturization==
Two complementary approaches to fabrication of NEMS can be found. The [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] approach uses the traditional microfabrication methods, i.e. [[Photolithography|optical]], [[electron beam lithography]] and thermal treatments, to manufacture devices. While being limited by the resolution of these methods, it allows a large degree of control over the resulting structures. In this manner devices such as [[Silicon nanowire | nanowires]], nanorods, and patterned nanostructures are fabricated from metallic thin films or etched [[semiconductor]] layers.

Bottom-up approaches, in contrast, use the chemical properties of single molecules to cause single-molecule components to self-organize or self-assemble into some useful conformation, or rely on positional assembly. These approaches utilize the concepts of molecular [[self-assembly]] and/or [[molecular recognition]]. This allows fabrication of much smaller structures, albeit often at the cost of limited control of the fabrication process.

A combination of these approaches may also be used, in which nanoscale molecules are integrated into a top-down framework. One such example is the carbon [[nanotube nanomotor]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Materials==

=== Carbon allotropes===
Many of the commonly used materials for NEMS technology have been [[carbon]] based, specifically [[diamond]],&lt;ref name=diamondQ&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ncomms4638|arxiv=1212.1347|title=Single-crystal diamond nanomechanical resonators with quality factors exceeding one million|journal=Nature Communications|volume=5|year=2014|last1=Tao|first1=Y.|last2=Boss|first2=J.

This is mainly because of the useful properties of carbon based materials which directly meet the needs of NEMS. The mechanical properties of carbon (such as large [[Young's modulus]]) are fundamental to the stability of NEMS while the metallic and [[semiconductor]] conductivities of carbon based materials allow them to function as [[transistor]]s.

Both graphene and diamond exhibit high Young's modulus, low density, low friction, exceedingly low mechanical dissipation,&lt;ref name=diamondQ /&gt; and large surface area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1136836|title=Electromechanical Resonators from Graphene Sheets|date=2007|last1=Bunch|first1=J.

Along with the mechanical benefits of carbon based materials, the electrical properties of carbon nanotubes and graphene allow it to be used in many electrical components of NEMS. Nanotransistors have been developed for both carbon nanotubes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/29954|bibcode=1998Natur.393...49T|date=1998|last1=Dekker|first1=Cees|last2=Tans|first2=Sander J.|last3=Verschueren|first3=Alwin R. M.|journal=Nature|volume=393|issue=6680|pages=49–52|title=Room-temperature transistor based on a single carbon nanotube}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as graphene.&lt;ref name = Westervelt2008&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1156936|title=APPLIED PHYSICS: Graphene Nanoelectronics|date=2008|last1=Westervelt|first1=R. M.|journal=Science|volume=320|issue=5874|pages=324–325|pmid=18420920 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transistor]]s are one of the basic building blocks for all electronic devices, so by effectively developing usable transistors, carbon nanotubes and graphene are both very crucial to NEMS.

==== Metallic carbon nanotubes ====
[[Image:Carbon nanotube bands.gif|thumb|Band structures computed using [[tight binding]] approximation for (6,0) CNT ([[zigzag]], metallic), (10,2) CNT (semiconducting) and (10,10) CNT (armchair, metallic).]]

[[Carbon nanotubes]] (CNTs) are allotropes of carbon with a cylindrical nanostructure. They can be considered a rolled up [[graphene]]. When rolled at specific and discrete ("[[chiral]]") angles, and the combination of the rolling angle and radius decides whether the nanotube has a bandgap (semiconducting) or no bandgap (metallic).
 
[[Metal]]lic carbon nanotubes have also been proposed for nanoelectronic [[interconnects]] since they can carry high current densities.&lt;ref name = Hermann2008/&gt;  This is a useful property as wires to transfer current are another basic building block of any electrical system. Carbon nanotubes have specifically found so much use in NEMS that methods have already been discovered to connect suspended carbon nanotubes to other nanostructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.micro.mavt.ethz.ch/publications/Bauerdick2006|doi=10.1116/1.2388965|title=Direct wiring of carbon nanotubes for integration in nanoelectromechanical systems|date=2006|last1=Bauerdick|first1=S.|last2=Linden|first2=A.|last3=Stampfer|first3=C.|last4=Helbling|first4=T.|last5=Hierold|first5=C.|journal=Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B|volume=24|issue=6|page=3144|bibcode=2006JVSTB..24.3144B|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323123849/http://www.micro.mavt.ethz.ch/publications/Bauerdick2006|archivedate=2012-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows carbon nanotubes to form complicated nanoelectric systems.  Because carbon based products can be properly controlled and act as interconnects as well as transistors, they serve as a fundamental material in the electrical components of NEMS.

====Difficulties====
Despite all of the useful properties of carbon nanotubes and graphene for NEMS technology, both of these products face several hindrances to their implementation.  One of the main problems is carbon’s response to real life environments.  Carbon nanotubes exhibit a large change in electronic properties when exposed to [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10710305|date=2000|last1=Collins|first1=PG|last2=Bradley|first2=K|last3=Ishigami|first3=M|last4=Zettl|first4=A|title=Extreme oxygen sensitivity of electronic properties of carbon nanotubes|volume=287|issue=5459|pages=1801–4|journal=Science|bibcode = 2000Sci...287.1801C |doi = 10.1126/science.287.5459.1801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, other changes to the electronic and mechanical attributes of carbon based materials must fully be explored before their implementation, especially because of their high surface area which can easily react with surrounding environments. Carbon nanotubes were also found to have varying conductivities, being either metallic or semiconducting depending on their [[Magnetic helicity|helicity]] when processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/382054a0|bibcode=1996Natur.382...54E|title=Electrical conductivity of individual carbon nanotubes|date=1996|last1=Ebbesen|first1=T. W.|last2=Lezec|first2=H. J.|last3=Hiura|first3=H.|last4=Bennett|first4=J. W.|last5=Ghaemi|first5=H. F.|last6=Thio|first6=T.|journal=Nature|volume=382|issue=6586|pages=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this, special treatment must be given to the nanotubes during processing to assure that all of the nanotubes have appropriate conductivities.  Graphene also has complicated electric conductivity properties compared to traditional semiconductors because it lacks an energy [[band gap]] and essentially changes all the rules for how electrons move through a graphene based device.&lt;ref name = Westervelt2008/&gt;  This means that traditional constructions of electronic devices will likely not work and completely new architectures must be designed for these new electronic devices.

===Biohybrid NEMS===
{{Main|Biological machine}}
The emerging field of bio-hybrid systems combines biological and synthetic structural elements for biomedical or robotic applications. The constituting elements of bio-nanoelectromechanical systems (BioNEMS) are of nanoscale size, for example DNA, proteins or nanostructured mechanical parts. Examples include the facile top-down nanostructuring of thiol-ene polymers to create cross-linked and mechanically robust nanostructures that are subsequently functionalized with proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shafagh|first=Reza|last2=Vastesson|first2=Alexander|last3=Guo|first3=Weijin|last4=van der Wijngaart|first4=Wouter|last5=Haraldsson|first5=Tommy|year=2018|title=E-Beam Nanostructuring and Direct Click Biofunctionalization of Thiol–Ene Resist|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.8b03709|journal=ACS Nano|language=en|doi=10.1021/acsnano.8b03709|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulations==
Computer simulations have long been important counterparts to experimental studies of NEMS devices.  Through [[continuum mechanics]] and [[molecular dynamics]] (MD), important behaviors of NEMS devices can be predicted via computational modeling before engaging in experiments.&lt;ref name="DequesnesTangAluru"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Static and Dynamic Analysis of Carbon Nanotube-Based Switches|url=https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/aluru/www/Journals/JEMT04.pdf|doi=10.1115/1.1751180|date=2004|last1=Dequesnes|first1=Marc|last2=Tang|first2=Zhi|last3=Aluru|first3=N.

==Future==
Key hurdles currently preventing the commercial application of many NEMS devices include low-yields and high device quality variability.  Before NEMS devices can actually be implemented, reasonable integrations of carbon based products must be created.  A recent step in that direction has been demonstrated for diamond, achieving a processing level comparable to that of silicon.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Tao and C. L. Degen. "Facile Fabrication of Single-Crystal-Diamond
Nanostructures with Ultra High Aspect Ratio". Advanced Materials (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The focus is currently shifting from experimental work towards practical applications and device structures that will implement and profit from such novel devices.&lt;ref name = Kis2008/&gt;   The next challenge to overcome involves understanding all of the properties of these carbon-based tools, and using the properties to make efficient and durable NEMS with low failure rates.&lt;ref name="LohWeiKeSullicanEspinosa"/&gt;

Carbon-based materials have served as prime materials for NEMS use, because of their exceptional mechanical and electrical properties.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The global market of NEMS is projected to reach $108.88 million by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Market of NEMS projection|url=http://www.azonano.com/news.aspx?newsID=25791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative testing is a method of testing an application or system that ensures that the plot of the application is according to the requirements and can handle the unwanted input and user behavior. Invalid data is inserted to compare the output against the given input. Negative testing is also known as failure testing or error path testing. When performing negative testing exceptions are expected. This shows that the application is able to handle improper user behavior. Users input values that do not work in the system to test it's ability to handle incorrect values or system failure.

== Purpose ==
* The purpose of negative testing is to prevent the application from crashing and it also helps  improve the quality of an application by detecting defects.
* Negative testing helps you to improve the testing coverage of the application.
* Negative testing makes the application more stable and reliable.
* Negative testing together with positive testing allows users to test the application with any valid or invalid) input data.

== Benefits of negative testing ==
Negative testing is done to check that product deals properly with the circumstance for which it is not programmed. The fundamental aim of this testing is check that how bad data is taken care of by the systems, and appropriate errors are shown to client when bad data is entered. Both positive and negative testing play important role. Positive testing ensures that application does what it is implied for and perform each function as expected. Negative testing is opposite of positive testing. Negative testing discovers diverse approaches to make the [[Crash (computing)|application crash]] and handle the crash effortlessly.

'''Example'''
* If there is a text box that can only take numeric values but the user type to write letter, the correct behavior in this case "(Incorrect data) Please enter a number" message should be displayed to the user.
* If user is to fill the name field, there are ground rules that name text is mandatory to fill, name box shouldn't have values other than alphabets (no numeric values and special characters). Negative test cases for the text would be Name having numeric values, name having special characters and nothing is written in that text field.

== Parameters for writing Negative test cases ==
There are two basic techniques that help to write the sufficient test cases to cover the most of the functionalities of the system. Both these techniques are used in positive testing as well.
The two parameters are:&lt;br /&gt;
'''* [[Boundary-value analysis]]''' 
Boundary indicates limit to something. In this parameter, test scenarios are designed in such a way that it covers the boundary values and validate how application behaves on these boundary values.
'''Example'''&lt;br /&gt;
If there is an application that accepts Ids ranging from 0-255.Hence in this scenario, 0,255 will form the boundary values. The values within the range of 0-255 will constitute the positive testing. Any inputs going below from 0 and input going above from 255 will be considered invalid and will constitute negative testing.

'''Nima''' is a portable connected food sensor. The first product, a [[gluten]] sensor was released in Fall 2016. The second product, a [[peanut]] sensor is scheduled to be released in the second half of 2018.

== Operation ==
A food sample is placed in a one-time use capsule, which is inserted into the Nima sensor. Once the test begins, the food is mixed with proprietary antibodies and analyzed by the sensor for approximately two to three minutes. If the sample contains less than twenty parts per million of gluten (the same limit required by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] for gluten-free labeling), or less than ten parts per million of peanut, Nima displays a smiley face; otherwise a "gluten found" or "peanut found" icon is displayed. The device has not been approved by the FDA, although the developers contest that such approval is not necessary because they "are not using it to diagnose or manage disease."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marcus|first1=Mary Brophy|title=Portable gluten test promises to ease dining woes|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/6sensorlabs-portable-gluten-test-promises-to-ease-dining-woes/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=11 February 2016|date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nima has also developed a companion application for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]], connected through [[Bluetooth]], that allows users to connect with other Nima owners and find allergen information for specific restaurants and packaged foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matchar|first1=Emily|title=Test Your Restaurant Meal for Allergens in Two Minutes|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/test-your-restaurant-meal-allergens-two-minutes-180956529/|publisher=Smithsonian.com|accessdate=11 February 2016|date=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company plans to eventually expand its technology to detect other allergens, such as dairy and tree nuts. They are also exploring detection methods for additives, [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]]s, preservatives and possible causes of food poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zipkin|first1=Nina|title=Avoiding Gluten?

== Reception ==
Nima was listed among [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]'s best inventions of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=TIME Staff|title=The 25 Best Inventions of 2015|url=http://time.com/4115398/best-inventions-2015/item/the-sensor-that-sniffs-out-gluten/|publisher=Time|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a natural connection between [[particle physics]] and [[representation theory]], as first noted in the 1930s by [[Eugene Wigner]].&lt;ref&gt;Wigner received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1963 "for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles"; see also [[Wigner's theorem]], [[Wigner's classification]].&lt;/ref&gt; It links the properties of [[elementary particle]]s to the structure of [[Lie groups]] and [[Lie algebras]]. According to this connection, the different [[quantum state]]s of an elementary particle give rise to an [[irreducible representation]] of the [[Poincaré group]]. Moreover, the properties of the various particles, including their [[energy spectrum|spectra]], can be related to representations of Lie algebras, corresponding to "approximate symmetries" of the universe.

== General picture ==
===Symmetries of a quantum system===
In [[quantum mechanics]], any particular one-particle state is represented as a [[vector space|vector]] in a [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt;. To help understand what types of particles can exist, it is important to classify the possibilities for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; allowed by [[Wigner's theorem#Symmetry transformations|symmetries]], and their properties. In a relativistic quantum system, for example, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; might be the [[Poincaré group]], while for the hydrogen atom, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; might be the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. The particle state is more precisely characterized by the associated [[projective Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm P\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt;, also called [[Wigner's theorem#Rays and ray space|ray space]], since two vectors that differ by a nonzero scalar factor correspond to the same physical [[quantum state]] represented by a ''ray'' in Hilbert space, which is an [[equivalence class]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; and, under the natural projection map &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H \rightarrow \mathrm P \mathcal H&lt;/math&gt;, an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm P\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; be a Hilbert space describing a particular quantum system and let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group of symmetries of the quantum system. By definition of a symmetry of a quantum system, there is a [[group action]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathrm P\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt;. For each &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, there is a corresponding transformation &lt;math&gt;V(g)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm P\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt;. More specifically, if &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is some symmetry of the system (say, rotation about the x-axis by 12°), then the corresponding transformation &lt;math&gt;V(g)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm P\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; is a map on ray space. For example, when rotating a ''stationary'' (zero momentum) spin-5 particle about its center, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a rotation in 3D space (an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SO(3)}&lt;/math&gt;), while &lt;math&gt;V(g)&lt;/math&gt; is an operator whose domain and range are each the space of possible quantum states of this particle, in this example the projective space &lt;math&gt;\mathrm P\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; associated with an 11-dimensional complex Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt;.

Each map &lt;math&gt;V(g)&lt;/math&gt; preserves, by definition of symmetry, the [[Wigner's theorem#Symmetry transformations|ray product]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathrm P\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; induced by the inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt;; according to [[Wigner's theorem]], this transformation of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm P\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; comes from a unitary or anti-unitary transformation &lt;math&gt;U(g)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt;. Note, however, that the &lt;math&gt;U(g)&lt;/math&gt; associated to a given &lt;math&gt;V(g)&lt;/math&gt; is not unique, but only unique ''up to a phase factor''. The composition of the operators &lt;math&gt;U(g)&lt;/math&gt; should, therefore, reflect the composition law in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, but only up to a phase factor:

:&lt;math&gt;U(gh)=e^{i\theta}U(g)U(h)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; will depend on &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the map sending &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;U(g)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[projective representation|''projective unitary representation'']] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, or possibly a mixture of unitary and anti-unitary, if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is disconnected. In practice, anti-unitary operators are always associated with [[T-symmetry|time-reversal symmetry]].

===Ordinary versus projective representations===

It is important physically that in general &lt;math&gt;U(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; does not have to be an ordinary representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;; it may not be possible to choose the phase factors in the definition of &lt;math&gt;U(g)&lt;/math&gt; to eliminate the phase factors in their composition law. An electron, for example, is a spin-one-half particle; its Hilbert space consists of wave functions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; with values in a two-dimensional spinor space. The action of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SO(3)}&lt;/math&gt; on the spinor space is only projective: It does not come from an ordinary representation of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SO(3)}&lt;/math&gt;. There is, however, an associated ordinary representation of the universal cover &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SU(2)}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SO(3)}&lt;/math&gt; on spinor space. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 4.7&lt;/ref&gt;

For many interesting classes of groups &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, [[Projective_representation#Infinite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations:_Bargmann's_theorem|Bargmann's theorem]] tells us that every projective unitary representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; comes from an ordinary representation of the universal cover &lt;math&gt;\tilde{G}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Actually, if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; is finite dimensional, then regardless of the group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, every projective unitary representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; comes from an ordinary unitary representation of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{G}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Theorem 16.47&lt;/ref&gt; If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; is infinite dimensional, then to obtain the desired conclusion, some algebraic assumptions must be made on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (see below). In this setting the result is a [[Projective_representation#Bargmann's_theorem_on_infinite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations|theorem of Bargmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bargmann | first1 = V. | year = 1954 | title = On unitary ray representations of continuous groups | url = | journal = Ann. of Math. | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 1–46 | doi=10.2307/1969831}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, the crucial case of the Poincaré group, Bargmann's theorem applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|1995}} Chapter 2, Appendix A and B.&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Wigner's classification]] of the representations of the universal cover of the Poincaré group.)

The requirement referred to above is that the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; does not admit a nontrivial one-dimensional central extension. This is the case if and only if the [[Lie algebra extension#second cohomology group|second cohomology group]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is trivial. In this case, it may still be true that the group admits a central extension by a ''discrete'' group. But extensions of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; by a discrete group are nothing but a covers of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, the universal cover &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; is related to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; through the quotient &lt;math&gt;G \approx \tilde G/\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; with the central subgroup &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; being the center of &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; itself, isomorphic to the [[fundamental group]] of the covered group.

Thus, in favorable cases, the quantum system will carry a unitary representation of the universal cover &lt;math&gt;\tilde{G}&lt;/math&gt; of the symmetry group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. This is desirable because &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; is much easier to work with than the non-vector space &lt;math&gt;\mathrm P\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt;. If the representations of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{G}&lt;/math&gt; can be classified, much more information about the possibilities and properties of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; are available.

===The Heisenberg case===
An example in which Bargmann's theorem does not apply comes from a quantum particle moving in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;. The group of translational symmetries of the associated phase space, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, is the commutative group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;. In the usual quantum mechanical picture, the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; symmetry is not implement by a unitary representation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;. After all, in the quantum setting, translations in position space and translations in momentum space do not commute. This failure to commute reflects the failure of the position and momentum operators—which are the infinitesimal generators of translations in momentum space and position space, respectively—to commute. Nevertheless, translations in position space and translations in momentum space ''do'' commute up to a phase factor. Thus, we have a well-defined projective representation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, but it does not come from an ordinary representation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, even though &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; is simply connected. 

In this case, to obtain an ordinary representation, one has to pass to the [[Heisenberg group]], which is a nontrivial one-dimensional central extension of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Poincaré group ==
{{main|Wigner's classification}}

The group of translations and [[Lorentz transformations]] form the [[Poincaré group]], and this group should be a symmetry of a relativistic quantum system (neglecting [[general relativity]] effects, or in other words, in [[flat space]]). [[Representation theory of the Poincaré group|Representations of the Poincaré group]] are in many cases characterized by a nonnegative [[mass]] and a half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]] (see [[Wigner's classification]]); this can be thought of as the reason that particles have quantized spin. (Note that there are in fact other possible representations, such as [[tachyon]]s, [[infraparticle]]s, etc., which in some cases do not have quantized spin or fixed mass.)

== Other symmetries ==
[[File:Standard Model charges.svg|300px|right|thumb|The pattern of [[weak isospin]]s, [[weak hypercharge]]s, and [[color charge|color]] charges (weights) of all known elementary particles in the [[Standard Model]], rotated by the [[weak mixing angle]] to show electric charge roughly along the vertical.]]

While the [[spacetime symmetries]] in the Poincaré group are particularly easy to visualize and believe, there are also other types of symmetries, called [[internal symmetry|internal symmetries]]. One example is [[color charge|color]] [[SU(3)]], an exact symmetry corresponding to the continuous interchange of the three [[quark]] colors.

==Lie algebras versus Lie groups==
Many (but not all) symmetries or approximate symmetries form [[Lie groups]]. Rather than study the [[Representation theory#Lie groups|representation theory]] of these Lie groups, it is often preferable to study the closely related [[Representation theory#Lie algebras|representation theory]] of the corresponding Lie algebras, which are usually simpler to compute.

Now, representations of the Lie algebra correspond to representations of the [[Covering group|universal cover]] of the original group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 5.7&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Projective_representation#Finite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations|finite-dimensional case]]—and the infinite-dimensional case, provided that [[Projective_representation#Infinite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations:_Bargmann's_theorem|Bargmann's theorem]] applies—irreducible projective representations of the original group correspond to ordinary unitary representations of the universal cover. In those cases, computing at the Lie algebra level is appropriate. This is the case, notably, for studying the irreducible projective representations of the rotation group SO(3). These are in one-to-one correspondence with the ordinary representations of the [[Rotation_group_SO(3)#Connection_between_SO(3)_and_SU(2)|universal cover SU(2) of SO(3)]]. The representations of the SU(2) are then in one-to-one correspondence with the representations of its Lie algebra su(2), which is isomorphic to the Lie algebra so(3) of SO(3). 

Thus, to summarize, the irreducible projective representations of SO(3) are in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible ordinary representations of its Lie algebra so(3). The two-dimensional "spin 1/2" representation of the Lie algebra so(3), for example, does not correspond to an ordinary (single-valued) representation of the group SO(3). (This fact is the origin of statements to the effect that "if you rotate the wave function of an electron by 360 degrees, you get the negative of the original wave function.") Nevertheless, the spin 1/2 representation does give rise to a well-defined ''projective'' representation of SO(3), which is all that is required physically.

== Approximate symmetries ==
Although the above symmetries are believed to be exact, other symmetries are only approximate.

===Hypothetical example===
As an example of what an approximate symmetry means, suppose an experimentalist lived inside an infinite [[ferromagnet]], with magnetization in some particular direction. The experimentalist in this situation would find not one but two distinct types of electrons: one with spin along the direction of the magnetization, with a slightly lower energy (and consequently, a lower mass), and one with spin anti-aligned, with a higher mass. Our usual [[SO(3)]] rotational symmetry, which ordinarily connects the spin-up electron with the spin-down electron, has in this hypothetical case become only an ''approximate'' symmetry, relating ''different types of particles'' to each other.

===General definition===
In general, an approximate symmetry arises when there are very strong interactions that obey that symmetry, along with weaker interactions that do not. In the electron example above, the two "types" of electrons behave identically under the [[strong force|strong]] and [[weak force]]s, but differently under the [[electromagnetic force]].

===Example: isospin symmetry===
{{main|Isospin}}
An example from the real world is [[isospin|isospin symmetry]], an [[SU(2)]] group corresponding to the similarity between [[up quark]]s and [[down quark]]s. This is an approximate symmetry: While up and down quarks are identical in how they interact under the [[strong force]], they have different masses and different electroweak interactions. Mathematically, there is an abstract two-dimensional vector space
:&lt;math&gt;\text{up quark} \rightarrow \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad \text{down quark} \rightarrow \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
and the laws of physics are ''approximately'' invariant under applying a determinant-1 [[unitary transformation]] to this space:&lt;ref name=Thomson&gt;[http://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/~thomson/partIIIparticles/handouts/Handout_7_2011.pdf Lecture notes by Prof. Mark Thomson]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \mapsto A \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}, \quad \text{where } A \text{ is in } SU(2)&lt;/math&gt;
For example, &lt;math&gt;A=\begin{pmatrix} 0&amp;1 \\ -1&amp;0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; would turn all up quarks in the universe into down quarks and vice versa. Some examples help clarify the possible effects of these transformations:
*When these unitary transformations are applied to a [[proton]], it can be transformed into a [[neutron]], or into a superposition of a proton and neutron, but not into any other particles. Therefore, the transformations move the proton around a two-dimensional space of quantum states. The proton and neutron are called an "[[isospin multiplet|isospin doublet]]", mathematically analogous to how a [[spin-½]] particle behaves under ordinary rotation.
*When these unitary transformations are applied to any of the three [[pion]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Pion+}}, and {{SubatomicParticle|Pion-}}), it can change any of the pions into any other, but not into any non-pion particle. Therefore, the transformations move the pions around a three-dimensional space of quantum states. The pions are called an "[[isospin multiplet|isospin triplet]]", mathematically analogous to how a spin-1 particle behaves under ordinary rotation.
*These transformations have no effect at all on an [[electron]], because it contains neither up nor down quarks. The electron is called an isospin singlet, mathematically analogous to how a spin-0 particle behaves under ordinary rotation.

In general, particles form [[isospin multiplet]]s, which correspond to irreducible representations of the [[Special unitary group#Lie algebra|Lie algebra SU(2)]]. Particles in an isospin multiplet have very similar but not identical masses, because the up and down quarks are very similar but not identical.

===Example: flavour symmetry===
{{main|eightfold way (physics)}}

Isospin symmetry can be generalized to [[flavour symmetry]], an [[SU(3)]] group corresponding to the similarity between [[up quark]]s, [[down quark]]s, and [[strange quark]]s.&lt;ref name=Thomson/&gt; This is, again, an approximate symmetry, violated by quark mass differences and electroweak interactions—in fact, it is a poorer approximation than isospin, because of the strange quark's noticeably higher mass.

Nevertheless, particles can indeed be neatly divided into groups that form irreducible representations of the [[Special unitary group#Lie algebra|Lie algebra SU(3)]], as first noted by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and independently by [[Yuval Ne'eman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1514">The description of motion in relativity requires more than one concept of speed. [[Coordinate speed]] is the [[coordinate distance]] measured by the observer divided by the [[coordinate time]] of the observer. [[Proper velocity|Proper speed]] is the local [[proper distance]] divided by the local [[proper time]]. For example, at the [[event horizon]] of a black hole the coordinate speed of light is zero, while the proper speed is c.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AzfFo6A94WEC&amp;pg=PA188 Relativity and the Nature of Spacetime], Vesselin Petkov, Springer, 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-642-01952-4}}, Chapter: 7&lt;/ref&gt; The coordinate speed of light (both instantaneous and average) is slowed in the presence of [[gravitational field]]s. The local instantaneous proper speed of light is always c.
&lt;br&gt;
In an [[inertial frame]] an observer cannot detect their motion via light signals as the [[speed of light in a vacuum]] is constant. This means an observer can detect when their motion is [[accelerated]] by studying light signals.

A '''scanning electron microscope''' ('''SEM''') is a type of [[electron microscope]] that produces images of a sample by scanning the surface with a focused beam of [[electron]]s. The electrons interact with [[atom]]s in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the surface [[topography]] and composition of the sample. The electron beam is scanned in a [[raster scan]] pattern, and the position of the beam is combined with the detected signal to produce an image. SEM can achieve resolution better than 1 nanometer. Specimens are observed in high vacuum in conventional SEM, or in low vacuum or wet conditions in variable pressure or environmental SEM, and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures with specialized instruments.&lt;ref name="Stokes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stokes|first1=Debbie J.|title=Principles and Practice of Variable Pressure Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (VP-ESEM).|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0470758748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common SEM mode is the detection of secondary electrons emitted by atoms excited by the electron beam. The number of secondary electrons that can be detected depends, among other things, on specimen topography. By scanning the sample and collecting the secondary electrons that are emitted using a special detector, an image displaying the topography of the surface is created.

==History==
An account of the early history of SEM has been presented by McMullan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McMullan, D. |doi=10.1002/sca.4950170309|url=http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/achievements/mcmullan/mcm.htm|title=Scanning electron microscopy 1928–1965|year=2006|journal=Scanning|volume=17|issue=3|pages=175–185|pmc=2496789}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McMullan, D.|year=1988|title=Von Ardenne and the scanning electron microscope|journal= Proc Roy Microsc Soc |volume=23|pages= 283–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Max Knoll]] produced a photo with a 50&amp;nbsp;mm object-field-width showing channeling contrast by the use of an electron beam scanner,&lt;ref name="knoll"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knoll |first=Max|year=1935 |title=Aufladepotentiel und Sekundäremission elektronenbestrahlter Körper |journal=Zeitschrift für technische Physik |volume=16|pages=467–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was [[Manfred von Ardenne]] who in 1937 invented&lt;ref name="vonardenne"&gt;von Ardenne M.

==Principles and capacities==
The signals used by a scanning electron microscope to produce an image result from interactions of the electron beam with atoms at various depths within the sample. Various types of signals are produced including [[secondary electrons]] (SE), reflected or [[Backscatter|back-scattered electrons]] (BSE), characteristic X-rays and light ([[cathodoluminescence]]) (CL), absorbed current (specimen current) and transmitted electrons.  Secondary electron detectors are standard equipment in all SEMs, but it is rare for a single machine to have detectors for all other possible signals.

In secondary electron imaging (SEI), the secondary electrons are emitted from very close to the specimen surface. Consequently, SEI can produce very high-resolution images of a sample surface, revealing details less than 1 [[Nanometre|nm]] in size. Back-scattered electrons (BSE) are beam electrons that are reflected from the sample by [[elastic scattering]]. They emerge from deeper locations within the specimen and, consequently, the resolution of BSE images is less than SE images. However, BSE are often used in analytical SEM, along with the spectra made from the characteristic X-rays, because the intensity of the BSE signal is strongly related to the atomic number (Z) of the specimen. BSE images can provide information about the distribution, but not the identity, of different elements in the sample.  In samples predominantly composed of light elements, such as biological specimens, BSE imaging can image [[colloidal gold]] [[Immunogold labelling|immuno-labels]] of 5 or 10&amp;nbsp;nm diameter, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to detect in secondary electron images.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"/&gt; Characteristic [[X-ray]]s are emitted when the electron beam removes an [[Electron shell|inner shell electron]] from the sample, causing a [[Energy level|higher-energy electron]] to fill the shell and release energy. The energy or wavelength of these characteristic X-rays can be measured by [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] or [[Wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] and used to identify and measure the abundance of elements in the sample and map their distribution.

Due to the very narrow electron beam, SEM micrographs have a large [[depth of field]] yielding a characteristic three-dimensional appearance useful for understanding the surface structure of a sample.&lt;ref name="Goldsteinetal1981" /&gt; This is exemplified by the micrograph of pollen shown above. A wide range of magnifications is possible, from about 10 times (about equivalent to that of a powerful hand-lens) to more than 500,000 times, about 250 times the magnification limit of the best [[light microscope]]s.

==Sample preparation==
[[File:Gold Spider SEM sample.jpg|thumb|A spider sputter-coated in gold, having been prepared for viewing with an SEM]]
[[File:Pos.tif|thumb|Low-voltage micrograph (300&amp;nbsp;V) of distribution of adhesive droplets on a [[Post-it note]]. No conductive coating was applied: such a coating would alter this fragile specimen.]]
SEM samples are prepared to withstand the vacuum conditions and the high energy beam of electrons, and have to be small enough to fit on the specimen stage. Samples are generally mounted rigidly to a specimen holder or stub using a conductive adhesive. SEM is used extensively for defect analysis of semiconductor wafers, and manufacturers make instruments that can examine any part of a 300&amp;nbsp;mm semiconductor wafer. Many instruments have chambers that can tilt an object of that size to 45° and provide continuous 360° rotation.

Nonconductive specimens collect charge when scanned by the electron beam, and especially in secondary electron imaging mode, this causes scanning faults and other image artifacts. For conventional imaging in the SEM, specimens must be [[electrical conductivity|electrically conductive]], at least at the surface, and [[ground (electricity)|electrically grounded]] to prevent the accumulation of [[static electricity|electrostatic charge]]. Metal objects require little special preparation for SEM except for cleaning and conductively mounting to a specimen stub.  Non-conducting materials are usually coated with an ultrathin coating of electrically conducting material, deposited on the sample either by low-vacuum [[sputter coating]] or by high-vacuum evaporation. Conductive materials in current use for specimen coating include [[gold]], gold/[[palladium]] alloy, [[platinum]], [[iridium]], [[tungsten]], [[chromium]], [[osmium]],&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Suzuki |first=E. |year=2002 |title=High-resolution scanning electron microscopy of immunogold-labelled cells by the use of thin plasma coating of osmium |journal=Journal of Microscopy |volume=208 |issue=3 |pages=153–157 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2818.2002.01082.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[graphite]]. Coating with heavy metals may increase signal/noise ratio for samples of low [[atomic number]] (Z). The improvement arises because secondary electron emission for high-Z materials is enhanced.

An alternative to coating for some biological samples is to increase the bulk conductivity of the material by impregnation with osmium using variants of the OTO [[staining]] method (O-[[osmium tetroxide]], T-[[thiocarbohydrazide]], O-osmium).&lt;ref name="Seligman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seligman |first=Arnold M. |author2=Wasserkrug, Hannah L. |author3=Hanker, Jacob S.  |year=1966 |title=A new staining method for enhancing contrast of lipid-containing membranes and droplets in osmium tetroxide-fixed tissue with osmiophilic thiocarbohydrazide (TCH) |journal=Journal of Cell Biology |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=424–432 |doi=10.1083/jcb.30.2.424 |pmid=4165523 |pmc=2106998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malick"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Malick |first=Linda E. |author2=Wilson, Richard B. |author3=Stetson, David  |year=1975 |title=Modified Thiocarbohydrazide Procedure for Scanning Electron Microscopy: Routine use for Normal, Pathological, or Experimental Tissues |journal=Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=265–269 |doi=10.3109/10520297509117069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonconducting specimens may be imaged without coating using an environmental SEM (ESEM) or low-voltage mode of SEM operation.&lt;ref name="Hortolà"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hortolà |first=Policarp |year=2005 |title=SEM Examination of Human Erythrocytes in Uncoated Bloodstains on Stone: Use of Conventional as Environmental-like SEM in a Soft Biological Tissue (and Hard Inorganic Material) |journal=Journal of Microscopy |volume=218 |issue=2 |pages=94–103 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.2005.01477.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ESEM instruments the specimen is placed in a relatively high-pressure chamber and the electron optical column is differentially pumped to keep vacuum adequately low at the electron gun. The high-pressure region around the sample in the ESEM neutralizes charge and provides an amplification of the secondary electron signal.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Low-voltage SEM is typically conducted in an instrument with a [[field emission gun]]s (FEG) which is capable of producing high primary electron brightness and small spot size even at low accelerating potentials. To prevent charging of non-conductive specimens, operating conditions must be adjusted such that the incoming beam current is equal to sum of outcoming secondary and backscattered electrons currents a condition that is more often met at accelerating voltages of 0.3–4 kV.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Synthetic replicas can be made to avoid the use of original samples when they are not suitable or available for SEM examination due to methodological obstacles or legal issues. This technique is achieved in two steps: (1) a mold of the original surface is made using a silicone-based dental elastomer, and (2) a replica of the original surface is obtained by pouring a synthetic resin into the mold.&lt;ref name="Hortola"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hortolà |first=Policarp |year=2015 |title=Evaluating the Use of Synthetic Replicas for SEM Identification of Bloodstains (with Emphasis on Archaeological and Ethnographic Artifacts)|journal=Microscopy and Microanalysis|volume=21 |issue= 6|pages= 1504–1513|doi=10.1017/S1431927615014920|bibcode=2015MiMic..21.1504H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Embedding in a [[resin]] with further polishing to a mirror-like finish can be used for both biological and materials specimens when imaging in backscattered electrons or when doing quantitative X-ray microanalysis.

The main preparation techniques are not required in the [[#Environmental SEM|environmental SEM]] outlined below, but some biological specimens can benefit from fixation.

===Biological samples===
For SEM, a specimen is normally required to be completely dry, since the specimen chamber is at high vacuum. Hard, dry materials such as wood, bone, feathers, dried insects, or shells (including egg shells&lt;ref name="Conrad et al. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Conrad | first1 = Cyler | last2=Jones |first2=Emily Lena | last3=Newsome |first3=Seth D. |last4=Schwartz |first4=Douglas W. | year= 2016 | title=Bone isotopes, eggshell and turkey husbandry at Arroyo Hondo Pueblo | journal= Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports | volume = 10 | pages = 566 | doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2016.06.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) can be examined with little further treatment, but living cells and tissues and whole, soft-bodied organisms require chemical [[Fixation (histology)|fixation]] to preserve and stabilize their structure.

Fixation is usually performed by incubation in a solution of a [[Buffer solution|buffered]] chemical fixative, such as [[glutaraldehyde]], sometimes in combination with [[formaldehyde]]&lt;ref name="JeffreeRead" /&gt;&lt;ref name="karnovsky1965"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Karnovsky |first=M.

Because air-drying causes collapse and shrinkage, this is commonly achieved by replacement of [[water]] in the cells with organic solvents such as [[ethanol]] or [[acetone]], and replacement of these solvents in turn with a transitional fluid such as liquid [[carbon dioxide]] by [[critical point drying]].&lt;ref name="Chandler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Douglas E.|last2=Roberson|first2=Robert W.|title=Bioimaging : current concepts in light and electron microscopy|date=2009|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|location=Sudbury, Mass.|isbn=9780763738747}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbon dioxide is finally removed while in a supercritical state, so that no gas–liquid interface is present within the sample during drying.

The dry specimen is usually mounted on a specimen stub using an adhesive such as epoxy resin or electrically conductive double-sided adhesive tape, and sputter-coated with gold or gold/palladium alloy before examination in the microscope. Samples may be sectioned (with a [[microtome]]) if information about the organism's internal ultrastructure is to be exposed for imaging.

If the SEM is equipped with a cold stage for cryo microscopy, [[cryofixation]] may be used and low-temperature scanning electron microscopy performed on the cryogenically fixed specimens.&lt;ref name="JeffreeRead"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Ambient- and Low-temperature scanning electron microscopy |title=Electron Microscopy of Plant Cells |last=Jeffree |first=C.

Freeze-fracturing, freeze-etch or freeze-and-break is a preparation method particularly useful for examining lipid membranes and their incorporated proteins in "face on" view. The preparation method reveals the proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer.

===Materials===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}

Back-scattered electron imaging, quantitative X-ray analysis, and X-ray mapping of specimens often requires grinding and polishing the surfaces to an ultra smooth surface. Specimens that undergo [[Wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|WDS]] or [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDS]] analysis are often carbon-coated. In general, metals are not coated prior to imaging in the SEM because they are conductive and provide their own pathway to ground.

[[Fractography]] is the study of fractured surfaces that can be done on a light microscope or, commonly, on an SEM. The fractured surface is cut to a suitable size, cleaned of any organic residues, and mounted on a specimen holder for viewing in the SEM.

Integrated circuits may be cut with a [[focused ion beam]] (FIB) or other [[ion beam]] milling instrument for viewing in the SEM. The SEM in the first case may be incorporated into the FIB.{{clarify|reason=how, for what purpose?|date=February 2016}}

Metals, geological specimens, and integrated circuits all may also be chemically polished for viewing in the SEM.

Special high-resolution coating techniques are required for high-magnification imaging of inorganic thin films.

==Scanning process and image formation==
[[File:Schema MEB (en).svg|thumb|350px|Schematic of an SEM]]

In a typical SEM, an electron beam is [[thermionically]] emitted from an [[electron gun]] fitted with a tungsten filament [[cathode]]. Tungsten is normally used in thermionic electron guns because it has the highest melting point and lowest vapor pressure of all metals, thereby allowing it to be electrically heated for electron emission, and because of its low cost. Other types of electron emitters include [[lanthanum hexaboride]] ({{chem|LaB|6}}) cathodes, which can be used in a standard tungsten filament SEM if the vacuum system is upgraded or field emission guns (FEG), which may be of the [[cold-cathode]] type using tungsten single crystal emitters or the thermally assisted [[Walter H. Schottky|Schottky]] type, that use emitters of [[zirconium oxide]].

The electron beam, which typically has an [[energy]] ranging from 0.2 [[electronvolt|keV]] to 40 keV, is focused by one or two condenser lenses to a spot about 0.4&amp;nbsp;nm to 5&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter. The beam passes through pairs of [[scanning coils]] or pairs of deflector plates in the electron column, typically in the final lens, which deflect the beam in the ''x'' and ''y'' axes so that it scans in a [[Raster scan|raster]] fashion over a rectangular area of the sample surface.

[[File:Electron emission mechanisms.svg|thumb|Mechanisms of emission of secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, and characteristic X-rays from atoms of the sample]]

When the primary electron beam interacts with the sample, the electrons lose energy by repeated random scattering and absorption within a teardrop-shaped volume of the specimen known as the '''interaction volume''', which extends from less than 100&amp;nbsp;nm to approximately 5&amp;nbsp;µm into the surface. The size of the interaction volume depends on the electron's landing energy, the atomic number of the specimen and the specimen's density. The energy exchange between the electron beam and the sample results in the reflection of high-energy electrons by elastic scattering, emission of secondary electrons by [[inelastic scattering]] and the emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]], each of which can be detected by specialized detectors. The beam current absorbed by the specimen can also be detected and used to create images of the distribution of specimen current. [[Electronics|Electronic amplifiers]] of various types are used to amplify the signals, which are displayed as variations in brightness on a computer monitor (or, for vintage models, on a [[cathode ray tube]]). Each pixel of computer video memory is synchronized with the position of the beam on the specimen in the microscope, and the resulting image is, therefore, a distribution map of the intensity of the signal being emitted from the scanned area of the specimen. Older microscopes captured images on film, but most modern instrument collect [[digital images]].

[[File:LT-SEM snow crystal magnification series-3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Low-temperature SEM magnification series for a [[snow]] crystal. The crystals are captured, stored, and sputter-coated with platinum at cryogenic temperatures for imaging.]]

===Magnification===
Magnification in an SEM can be controlled over a range of about 6 [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] from about 10 to 500,000 times. Unlike optical and transmission electron microscopes, image magnification in an SEM is not a function of the power of the [[objective (optics)|objective lens]]. SEMs may have [[condenser (microscope)|condenser]] and objective lenses, but their function is to focus the beam to a spot, and not to image the specimen. Provided the electron gun can generate a beam with sufficiently small diameter, an SEM could in principle work entirely without condenser or objective lenses, although it might not be very versatile or achieve very high resolution. In an SEM, as in [[scanning probe microscopy]], magnification results from the ratio of the dimensions of the raster on the specimen and the raster on the display device. Assuming that the display screen has a fixed size, higher magnification results from reducing the size of the raster on the specimen, and vice versa. Magnification is therefore controlled by the current supplied to the x, y scanning coils, or the voltage supplied to the x, y deflector plates, and not by objective lens power.

==Detection of secondary electrons==
The most common imaging mode collects low-energy (&lt;50 eV) secondary electrons that are ejected from the k-shell of the specimen atoms by inelastic scattering interactions with beam electrons. Due to their low energy, these electrons originate within a few [[nanometer]]s from the sample surface.&lt;ref name="Goldsteinetal1981" /&gt; The electrons are detected by an [[Everhart-Thornley detector]],&lt;ref name="EverhartThornley"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Everhart |first=T. E. |author2=Thornley, R. F. M.  |year=1960 |title=Wide-band detector for micro-microampere low-energy electron currents |journal=Journal of Scientific Instruments |volume=37 |pages=246–248 |doi=10.1088/0950-7671/37/7/307 |issue=7|bibcode = 1960JScI...37..246E |url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/12086/1/EVEjsi60.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a type of [[scintillator]]-[[photomultiplier]] system. The secondary electrons are first collected by attracting them towards an electrically biased grid at about +400 V, and then further accelerated towards a phosphor or scintillator positively biased to about +2,000 V. The accelerated secondary electrons are now sufficiently energetic to cause the scintillator to emit flashes of light (cathodoluminescence), which are conducted to a photomultiplier outside the SEM column via a light pipe and a window in the wall of the specimen chamber. The amplified electrical [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] output by the photomultiplier is displayed as a two-dimensional intensity distribution that can be viewed and photographed on an analogue [[video]] display, or subjected to [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital conversion]] and displayed and saved as a [[digital image]]. This process relies on a raster-scanned primary beam. The brightness of the signal depends on the number of secondary electrons reaching the [[sensor|detector]]. If the beam enters the sample perpendicular to the surface, then the activated region is uniform about the axis of the beam and a certain number of electrons "escape" from within the sample. As the angle of incidence increases, the interaction volume increases and the "escape" distance of one side of the beam decreases, resulting in more secondary electrons being emitted from the sample. Thus steep surfaces and edges tend to be brighter than flat surfaces, which results in images with a well-defined, three-dimensional appearance. Using the signal of secondary electrons [[image resolution]] less than 0.5&amp;nbsp;nm is possible.

==Detection of backscattered electrons==
[[File:SEM SE vs BE Zr Al.png|thumb|Comparison of SEM techniques: &lt;br /&gt;Top: backscattered electron analysis{{snd}} composition &lt;br /&gt; Bottom: secondary electron analysis{{snd}} topography]]

Backscattered electrons (BSE) consist of high-energy electrons originating in the electron beam, that are reflected or back-scattered out of the specimen interaction volume by elastic scattering interactions with specimen atoms. Since heavy elements (high atomic number) backscatter electrons more strongly than light elements (low atomic number), and thus appear brighter in the image, BSEs are used to detect contrast between areas with different chemical compositions.&lt;ref name="Goldsteinetal1981"&gt;{{cite book |title=Scanning electron microscopy and x-ray microanalysis |last=Goldstein |first=G. I. |author2=Newbury, D. E. |author3=Echlin, P. |author4=Joy, D. C. |author5=Fiori, C. |author6= Lifshin, E. |year=1981 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |isbn=0-306-40768-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Everhart-Thornley detector, which is normally positioned to one side of the specimen, is inefficient for the detection of backscattered electrons because few such electrons are emitted in the solid angle subtended by the detector, and because the positively biased detection grid has little ability to attract the higher energy BSE. Dedicated backscattered electron detectors are positioned above the sample in a "doughnut" type arrangement, concentric with the electron beam, maximizing the solid angle of collection. BSE detectors are usually either of scintillator or of semiconductor types. When all parts of the detector are used to collect electrons symmetrically about the beam, atomic number contrast is produced. However, strong topographic contrast is produced by collecting back-scattered electrons from one side above the specimen using an asymmetrical, directional BSE detector; the resulting contrast appears as illumination of the topography from that side. Semiconductor detectors can be made in radial segments that can be switched in or out to control the type of contrast produced and its directionality.

Backscattered electrons can also be used to form an [[electron backscatter diffraction]] ([[EBSD]]) image that can be used to determine the crystallographic structure of the specimen.

==Beam-injection analysis of semiconductors==
The nature of the SEM's probe, energetic electrons, makes it uniquely suited to examining the optical and electronic properties of semiconductor materials. The high-energy electrons from the SEM beam will inject [[charge carrier]]s into the semiconductor. Thus, beam electrons lose energy by promoting electrons from the [[valence band]] into the [[conduction band]], leaving behind [[electron hole|holes]].

In a [[direct bandgap]] material, recombination of these electron-hole pairs will result in cathodoluminescence; if the sample contains an internal electric field, such as is present at a [[p-n junction]], the SEM beam injection of carriers will cause [[electron beam induced current]] (EBIC) to flow.  Cathodoluminescence and EBIC are referred to as "beam-injection" techniques, and are very powerful probes of the optoelectronic behavior of semiconductors, in particular for studying nanoscale features and defects.

==Cathodoluminescence==
[[File:InGaN_crystal_SEM%2BCL.png|thumb|Color cathodoluminescence overlay on SEM image of an [[InGaN]] polycrystal. The blue and green channels represent real colors, the red channel corresponds to UV emission.]]

[[Cathodoluminescence]], the emission of light when atoms excited by high-energy electrons return to their ground state, is analogous to [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-induced [[fluorescence]], and some materials such as zinc sulfide and some fluorescent dyes, exhibit both phenomena. Over the last decades, cathodoluminescence was most commonly experienced as the light emission from the inner surface of the [[cathode ray tube]] in television sets and computer CRT monitors. In the SEM, CL detectors either collect all light emitted by the specimen or can analyse the wavelengths emitted by the specimen and display an emission [[spectrum]] or an image of the distribution of cathodoluminescence emitted by the specimen in real color.

==X-ray microanalysis==
[[Characteristic X-ray]]s that are produced by the interaction of [[electrons]] with the sample may also be detected in an SEM equipped for [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] or [[wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]]. Analysis of the x-ray signals may be used to map the distribution and estimate the abundance of elements in the sample.

==Resolution of the SEM==
[[File:SEM Zoom.ogv|thumb|right|300px|A video illustrating a typical practical magnification range of a scanning electron microscope designed for biological specimens. The video starts at 25x, about 6 mm across the whole field of view, and zooms in to 12000×, about 12&amp;nbsp;[[μm]] across the whole field of view. The spherical objects are glass beads with a diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;μm, similar in diameter to a [[red blood cell]].]]
SEM is not a [[camera]] and the detector is not continuously image-forming like a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] array or [[Photographic film|film]]. Unlike in an optical system, the [[Optical resolution|resolution]] is not limited by the [[diffraction limit]], fineness of lenses or mirrors or detector array resolution. The focusing optics can be large and coarse, and the SE detector is fist-sized and simply detects current. Instead, the spatial resolution of the SEM depends on the size of the electron spot, which in turn depends on both the wavelength of the electrons and the electron-optical system that produces the scanning beam. The resolution is also limited by the size of the interaction volume, the volume of specimen material that interacts with the electron beam. The spot size and the interaction volume are both large compared to the distances between atoms, so the resolution of the SEM is not high enough to image individual atoms, as is possible with [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM). The SEM has compensating advantages, though, including the ability to image a comparatively large area of the specimen; the ability to image bulk materials (not just thin films or foils); and the variety of analytical modes available for measuring the composition and properties of the specimen. Depending on the instrument, the resolution can fall somewhere between less than 1&amp;nbsp;nm and 20&amp;nbsp;nm. As of 2009, The world's highest resolution conventional (≤30&amp;nbsp;kV) SEM can reach a point resolution of 0.4&amp;nbsp;nm using a secondary electron detector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanotech-now.com/news.cgi?story_id=42612 Hitachi Launches World’s Highest Resolution FE-SEM]. ''Nanotech Now''. 31 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental SEM==
{{Main|Environmental scanning electron microscope}}
Conventional SEM requires samples to be imaged under [[vacuum]], because a gas atmosphere rapidly spreads and [[attenuation|attenuates]] electron beams. As a consequence, samples that produce a significant amount of [[vapour pressure|vapour]], e.g. wet biological samples or oil-bearing rock, must be either dried or cryogenically frozen. Processes involving [[phase transition]]s, such as the drying of [[adhesive]]s or melting of [[alloy]]s, liquid transport, chemical reactions, and solid-air-gas systems, in general cannot be observed. Some observations of living insects have been possible however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Takaku |first1=Yasuharu |last2=Suzuki |first2=Hiroshi |last3=Ohta |first3=Isao |last4=Tsutsui |first4=Takami |last5=Matsumoto |first5=Haruko |last6=Shimomura |first6=Masatsugu |last7=Hariyama |first7=Takahiko |date=7 March 2015 |title=A ‘NanoSuit’ surface shield successfully protects organisms in high vacuum: observations on living organisms in an FE-SEM |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1802/20142857 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |language=en |volume=282 |issue=1802 |pages=20142857 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.2857 |issn=0962-8452 |pmc=4344158 |pmid=25631998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercial ESEMs were produced by the ElectroScan Corporation in USA in 1988. ElectroScan was taken over by Philips (who later sold their electron-optics division to FEI Company) in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfc.fr/Material/hrst.mit.edu/hrs/materials/public/ElectronMicroscope/EM1990s.htm History of Electron Microscopy 1990s]. sfc.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

ESEM is especially useful for non-metallic and biological materials because coating with carbon or gold is unnecessary. Uncoated [[Plastics]] and [[Elastomers]] can be routinely examined, as can uncoated biological samples. Coating can be difficult to reverse, may conceal small features on the surface of the sample and may reduce the value of the results obtained. X-ray analysis is difficult with a coating of a heavy metal, so carbon coatings are routinely used in conventional SEMs, but ESEM makes it possible to perform X-ray microanalysis on uncoated non-conductive specimens; however some specific for ESEM artifacts are introduced in X-ray analysis. ESEM may be the preferred for electron microscopy of unique samples from criminal or civil actions, where [[forensic analysis]] may need to be repeated by several different experts.

It is possible to study specimens in liquid with ESEM or with other [[Liquid-Phase Electron Microscopy|liquid-phase electron microscopy]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Jonge|first1= N.|last2= Ross|first2= F.M.|date=2011 | title=Electron microscopy of specimens in liquid | journal= Nature Nanotechnology |volume=6 | pages= 695–704 | doi=10.1038/nmat944|bibcode=2003NatMa...2..532W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission SEM==
The SEM can also be used in transmission mode by simply incorporating an appropriate detector below a thin specimen section.&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klein |first=Tobias |author2=Buhr, Egbert |author3=Frase, Carl G. |year=2012 |title=TSEM: A Review of Scanning Electron Microscopy in Transmission Mode and Its Applications |journal=Advances in Imaging and Electron Physics |volume=171 |pages=297–356 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-394297-5.00006-4|series=Advances in Imaging and Electron Physics |isbn=9780123942975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both bright and dark field imaging has been reported in the generally low accelerating beam voltage range used in SEM, which increases the contrast of unstained biological specimens at high magnifications with a field emission electron gun. This mode of operation has been abbreviated by the acronym tSEM.

==Color in SEM==
Electron microscopes do not naturally produce color images, as an SEM produces a single value per pixel; this value corresponds to the number of electrons received by the detector during a small period of time of the scanning when the beam is targeted to the (x,&amp;nbsp;y) pixel position.

This single number is usually represented, for each pixel, by a grey level, forming a "black-and-white" image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Jeremy|title=Under the Microscope: A Hidden World Revealed|year=1987|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=0521399408|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30A5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA11|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several ways have been used to get color electron microscopy images.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/7d4d3b26#/7d4d3b26/34 ''Showing your true colors'', 3D and color in electron microscopy in ''Lab News'' magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

===False color using a single detector===
* On compositional images of flat surfaces (typically BSE):
The easiest way to get color is to associate to this single number an arbitrary color, using a [[color look-up table]] (i.e. each grey level is replaced by a chosen color). This method is known as [[false color]]. On a BSE image, false color may be performed to better distinguish the various phases of the sample.&lt;ref name="3D_Color_SEM_Microscopy_Today"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mignot|first=Christophe|year=2018 |title=Color (and 3D) for Scanning Electron Microscopy |journal=Microscopy Today |volume=26 issue 3|pages=12–17 |doi=10.1017/S1551929518000482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On textured-surface images:
As an alternative to simply replacing each grey level by a color, a sample observed by an oblique beam allows researchers to create an approximative topography image (see further section [[#Photometric 3D rendering from a single SEM image|"Photometric 3D rendering from a single SEM image"]]). Such topography can then be processed by 3D-rendering algorithms for a more natural rendering of the surface texture

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===SEM image coloring===
Very often, published SEM images are artificially colored&lt;ref name="3D_Color_SEM_Microscopy_Today"/&gt;.  This may be done for aesthetic effect, to clarify structure or to add a realistic appearance to the sample&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hortolà|first=P. |year=2010 |title= Using digital color to increase the realistic appearance of SEM micrographs of bloodstains |journal= Micron |volume=41 |issue=7|pages=904–908|doi=10.1016/j.micron.2010.06.010|pmid=20638857 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally does not add information about the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Electron Microscopy|url=http://www.fei.com/uploadedfiles/documents/content/introduction_to_em_booklet_july_10.pdf|publisher=FEI Company|accessdate=12 December 2012|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coloring may be performed manually with photo-editing software, or semi-automatically with dedicated software using feature-detection or object-oriented segmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Next Monday, Digital Surf to Launch Revolutionary SEM Image Colorization|url=http://www.azom.com/news.aspx?newsID=45031|publisher=AZO Materials|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Color built using multiple electron detectors===
In some configurations more information is gathered per pixel, often by the use of multiple detectors.&lt;ref name="ColourInSEMImaging"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Antonovsky |first=A. |year=1984 |title=The application of colour to SEM imaging for increased definition |journal=Micron and Microscopica Acta |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=77–84 |doi=10.1016/0739-6260(84)90005-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a common example, secondary electron and backscattered electron detectors are superimposed and a color is assigned to each of the images captured by each detector,&lt;ref name=ColorSEMImages2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Danilatos |first=G.D. |year=1986 |title= Colour micrographs for backscattered electron signals in the SEM|journal=Scanning |volume=9 |issue= 3|pages=8–18|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.1986.tb04287.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ColorSEMImages3&gt;{{cite journal |last=Danilatos |first=G.D. |year=1986 |title= Environmental scanning electron microscopy in colour|journal=J.

This method is known as density-dependent color SEM (DDC-SEM). Micrographs produced by DDC-SEM retain topographical information, which is  better captured by the secondary electrons detector and combine it to the information about density, obtained by the backscattered electron detector.&lt;ref name="r0"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Analytical signals based on generated photons===
Measurement of the energy of photons emitted from the specimen is a common method to get analytical capabilities. Examples are the [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDS) detectors used in elemental analysis and [[cathodoluminescence microscope]] (CL) systems that analyse the intensity and spectrum of electron-induced [[luminescence]] in (for example) geological specimens.  In SEM systems using these detectors it is common to color code these extra signals and superimpose them in a single color image, so that differences in the distribution of the various components of the specimen can be seen clearly and compared. Optionally, the standard secondary electron image can be merged with the one or more compositional channels, so that the specimen's structure and composition can be compared.  Such images can be made while maintaining the full integrity of the original signal data, which is not modified in any way.

==3D in SEM==
SEMs do not naturally provide 3D images contrary to [[Scanning probe microscope|SPMs]]. However 3D data can be obtained using an SEM with different methods as follows.

===3D SEM reconstruction from a stereo pair===
* [[photogrammetry]] is the most metrologically accurate method to bring the third dimension to SEM images&lt;ref name="3D_Color_SEM_Microscopy_Today"/&gt;. Contrary to photometric methods (next paragraph), photogrammetry calculates absolute heights using triangulation methods. The drawbacks are that it works only if there is a minimum texture, and it requires two images to be acquired from two different angles, which implies the use of a tilt stage. ([[Photogrammetry]] is a software operation that calculates the shift (or "disparity") for each pixel, between the left image and the right image of the same pair. Such disparity reflects the local height).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Photometric 3D SEM reconstruction from a four-quadrant detector "shape from shading"=== 
This method typically uses a four-quadrant BSE detector (alternatively for one manufacturer, a 3-segment detector). The microscope produces four images of the same specimen at the same time, so no tilt of the sample is required. The method gives metrological 3D dimensions as far as the slope of the specimen remains reasonable.&lt;ref name="3D_Color_SEM_Microscopy_Today"/&gt; Most SEM manufacturers now (2018) offer such built-in or optional four-quadrant BSE detector, together with proprietary software allowing to calculate a 3D image in real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butterfield|first1=Nicholas|last2=Rowe|first2=Penny M.|last3=Stewart|first3=Emily|last4=Roesel|first4=David|last5=Neshyba|first5=Steven|title=Quantitative three-dimensional ice roughness from scanning electron microscopy|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|date=16 March 2017|volume=122|issue=5|pages=3023–3025|doi=10.1002/2016JD026094|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JD026094/full|accessdate=1 August 2017|ref=Butterfield2017|bibcode=2017JGRD..122.3023B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other approaches use more sophisticated (and sometimes GPU-intensive) methods like the [[optimal estimation]] algorithm and offer much better results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butterfield|first1=Nicholas|last2=Rowe|first2=Penny M.|last3=Stewart|first3=Emily|last4=Roesel|first4=David|last5=Neshyba|first5=Steven|title=Quantitative three-dimensional ice roughness from scanning electron microscopy|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|date=16 March 2017|volume=122|issue=5|pages=3025–3041|doi=10.1002/2016JD026094|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JD026094/full|accessdate=1 August 2017|ref=Butterfield2017|bibcode=2017JGRD..122.3023B}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the cost of high demands on computing power.

In all instances, this approach works by integration of the slope, so vertical slopes and overhangs are ignored; for instance, if an entire sphere lies on a flat, little more than the upper hemisphere is seen emerging above the flat, resulting in wrong altitude of the sphere apex. The prominence of this effect depends on the angle of the BSE detectors with respect to the sample, but these detectors are usually situated around (and close to) the electron beam, so this effect is very common.

===Photometric 3D rendering from a single SEM image===
This method requires an SEM image obtained in oblique low angle lighting. The grey-level is then interpreted as the slope, and the slope integrated to restore the specimen topography. This method is interesting for visual enhancement and the detection of the shape and position of objects ; however the vertical heights cannot usually be calibrated, contrary to other methods such as photogrammetry.&lt;ref name="3D_Color_SEM_Microscopy_Today"/&gt;

* Multi-Resolution reconstruction using single 2D File: High-quality 3D imaging may be an ultimate solution for revealing the complexities of any porous media, but acquiring them is costly and time consuming. High-quality 2D SEM images, on the other hand, are widely available. Recently, a novel three-step, multiscale, multiresolution reconstruction method is presented that directly uses 2D images in order to develop 3D models. This method, based on a Shannon Entropy and conditional simulation, can be used for most of the available stationary materials and can build various stochastic 3D models just using a few thin sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tahmasebi|first1=Pejman|last2=Javadpour|first2=Farzam|last3=Sahimi|first3=Muhammad|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep16373| title=Multiscale and multiresolution modeling of shales and their flow and morphological properties|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|pages=16373|doi=10.1038/srep16373|pmid=26560178|pmc=4642334|year=2015|bibcode=2015NatSR...516373T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications of 3D SEM===
One possible application is measuring the roughness of ice crystals. This method can combine variable-pressure environmental SEM and the 3D capabilities of the SEM to measure roughness on individual ice crystal facets, convert it into a computer model and run further statistical analysis on the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butterfield|first1=Nicholas|last2=Rowe|first2=Penny M.|last3=Stewart|first3=Emily|last4=Roesel|first4=David|last5=Neshyba|first5=Steven|title=Quantitative three-dimensional ice roughness from scanning electron microscopy|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|date=16 March 2017|volume=122|issue=5|pages=3023–3041|doi=10.1002/2016JD026094|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JD026094/full|accessdate=1 August 2017|ref=Butterfield2017|bibcode=2017JGRD..122.3023B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other measurements include fractal dimension, examining fracture surface of metals, characterization of materials, corrosion measurement, and dimensional measurements at the nano scale (step height, volume, angle, flatness, bearing ratio, coplanarity, etc.).{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

'''Social determinism''' is the theory that social interactions and constructs alone determine individual behavior (as opposed to biological or objective factors).

Consider certain [[human behavior]]s, such as committing murder, or writing poetry.  A social determinist would look only at social phenomena, such as customs and expectations, education, and interpersonal interactions, to decide whether or not a given person would exhibit any of these behaviors. They would discount biological and other non-social factors, such as [[Genetics|genetic]] makeup, the physical environment, etc. Ideas about nature and biology would be considered to be [[Social construction|socially constructed]].

== Social determinism and ideology ==
The socially determined actions of an individual can be influenced by forces that control the flow of ideas. By creating an [[ideology]] within the society of the individual, the individual's actions and reactions to [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] are predetermined to adhere to the [[social rules]] imposed on him/her. Ideologies can be created using social institutions such as schooling, which "have become the terrain upon which contending forces express their social and political interest" (Mayberry 3), or the mass media, which has "significant power in shaping the social agenda and framing of public opinion to support that agenda" (Colaguori 35).

By creating a social construction of reality, these forces directly create a [[hegemonic]] control over the future of individuals who feel like the social construct is natural and therefore unchangeable. Their actions become based in the context of their society so that, even if they possess an innate talent for a sport, if the social construction implies that their race is unathletic in general, or their nation or state does not produce athletes, they do not include the possibility of athleticism in their future. Their society has successfully determined their actions.

Social determinism can favor a political party's agenda by setting social rules so that the individual considers the party's agenda to be morally correct, an example being the 2010 G20 summit riots in Toronto. The media, controlled by corporations and the governments with agendas of their own, publicizes the riots as violent and dangerous, but the goal of the rioters, to rebel against those whose position in power enables them to abuse the system for personal gain, is lost because the focus is on the violence. The individuals' view on the subject are then directly influenced by the media and their reactions are predetermined by that social form of control. "We have been taught to think that censorship is the main mechanism of how the media uses information as a form of social control, but in fact what ''is'' said, and how it is ''selectively presented'', is a far more powerful form of information control." (Colaguori 35).

Social determinism was first studied by [[Emile Durkheim]] (1858 - 1917), French philosopher considered as the father of the social science.

== Social determinism ==
Social determinism is most commonly understood in opposition to [[biological determinism]]. Within the [[media studies]] discipline, however, social determinism is understood as the counterpart of technological determinism.
[[Technological determinism]] is the notion that technological change and development is inevitable, and that the characteristics of any given technology determine the way it is used by the society in which it is developed. The concept of technological determinism is dependent upon the premise that social changes come about as a result of the new capabilities that new technologies enable.

The notion of social determinism opposes this perspective. Social determinism perceives technology as a result of the society in which it is developed. A number of contemporary media theorists have provided persuasive accounts of social determinism, including Leila Green.

In her book ''Technoculture'' Leila Green examines in detail the workings of a social determinist perspective, and argues “social processes determine technology for social purposes”. {{Harv|Green|2001}} She claims that every technological development throughout history was born of a social need, be this need economical, political or military. {{Harv|Green|2001}}

According to Green, technology is always developed with a particular purpose or objective in mind. As the development of technology is necessarily facilitated by financial funding, a social determinist perspective recognizes that technology is always developed to benefit those who are capable of funding its development.

Thus social determinists perceive that technological development is not only determined by the society in which it occurs, but that it is inevitably shaped by the power structures that exist in that society. {{Harv|Green|2001}}

==Arguments against social determinism==
{{Original research|date=December 2017}}
Scientific studies have shown that [[social behavior]] is partly inherited and can influence infants and also even influence foetuses. Wired to be social means that infants are not taught that they are social beings, but they are born as prepared social beings. The infants are born with an inherited social skill.

Social pre-wiring deals with the study of fetal social behavior and social interactions in a multi-fetal environment. Specifically, social pre-wiring refers to the [[ontogeny]] of [[social relation|social interaction]]. Also informally referred to as, "wired to be social." The theory questions whether there is a propensity to [[social actions|socially oriented action]] already present ''before'' birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique [[genetics|genetic]] wiring to be social.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951360/ Umberto Castiello, et al: National Institutes of Health&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for [[social relation|social interaction]]. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of [[socialization]] or [[social construction]]. Rather, newborns most likely [[heredity|inherit]] to some extent [[social behavior]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]] through [[genetics]].&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

Principal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are [[social behavior]]s that are [[heredity|inherited]] and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of [[social relation|social interaction]] before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

The social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, "The central advance of this study is the demonstration that '[[social actions]]' are already performed in the second trimester of [[gestational age|gestation]]. Starting from the 14th week of [[gestational age|gestation]] twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of [[social behavior]]: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.".&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

The '''Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer''' ('''SAMPEX''') was a [[NASA]] solar and magnetospheric observatory, and was the first spacecraft in the [[Small Explorer program]]. It was launched into [[low Earth orbit]] on July 3, 1992, from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] aboard a [[Scout (rocket family)|Scout G-1]] rocket. SAMPEX was an international collaboration between NASA of the United States and the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]] of Germany.&lt;ref name="Mason1998"/&gt;

The spacecraft carried four instruments designed to measure the anomalous components of [[cosmic ray]]s, emissions from [[solar energetic particles]], and electron counts in Earth's [[magnetosphere]]. Built for a three-year mission, its science mission was ended on June 30, 2004.&lt;ref name="dc"/&gt; Mission control for SAMPEX was handled by the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] until October 1997, after which it was turned over to the [[Bowie State University]] Satellite Operations Control Center (BSOCC).&lt;ref name="eoportal"/&gt; BSOCC, with funding assistance from [[The Aerospace Corporation]], continued to operate the spacecraft after its science mission ended, using the spacecraft as an educational tool for its students while continuing to release science data to the public.&lt;ref name="aerospace20121121"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa20121101"/&gt;

Built for a three-year primary mission, the spacecraft continued to return science data until its [[atmospheric entry|reentry]] on November 13, 2012.&lt;ref name="aerospace20121121"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aerospace1992038a"/&gt;

Robert Nockolds was born at [[St Columb Major]], [[Cornwall]], the son of Dr Stephen Nockolds, a surgeon of [[Brighton]], and his wife Hilda Tomlinson. He was educated at [[Ascham St Vincent's School]], [[Eastbourne]] and at [[Felsted School]] where his interest in rocks already manifested itself. He then went to [[Victoria University of Manchester|Manchester University]] and then took a PhD at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He became a Fellow of Trinity College, and lectured in petrology at Cambridge. In 1957 he became Reader in Geochemistry at Cambridge, and Emeritus Reader. In 1959 he became a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], and was also an Honorary Fellow of the [[Geological Society of India]]. In 1972 he retired from Cambridge and was awarded the Murchison Medal of the Geological Society. He published a leading work on petrology and a large number of papers in various journals as shown below.

In 1932 he married Hilda Jackson (1909–1976) and subsequently after she died in 1976 he married Patricia Horsley (1923 - 10 July 2013) He was known to his friends as Nocky or Bob and whilst he didn't have children of his own he was affectionately embraced by Patricia's large family. In his retirement he devoted himself to his immaculate garden.

{{nihongo|'''Subaru Telescope'''|すばる望遠鏡|Subaru Bōenkyō}} is the {{convert|8.2|m|in|adj=on|sp=us}} flagship telescope of the [[National Astronomical Observatory of Japan]], located at the [[Mauna Kea Observatory]] on [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]]. It is named after the [[open star cluster]] known in English as the [[Pleiades]]. It had the largest monolithic [[primary mirror]] in the world from its commission until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/hitech/subaru/index.html |title=The Subaru Telescope |publisher=web-japan.org |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Subaru Telescope is a [[Ritchey-Chretien]] reflecting telescope. Instruments can be mounted at a [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassegrain]] focus below the primary mirror; at either of two [[Nasmyth telescope|Nasmyth]] focal points in enclosures on the sides of the telescope mount, to which light can be directed with a tertiary mirror; or at the [[prime focus]] in lieu of a secondary mirror, an arrangement rare on large telescopes, to provide a wide [[field of view]] suited to deep wide-field surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subarutelescope.org/Introduction/telescope.html |title=Specifications |publisher=Subaru Telescope" |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the [[University of Tokyo]] formed an engineering working group to develop and study the concept of a {{convert|7.5|m|in|adj=on|sp=us}} telescope. In 1985, the astronomy committee of Japan's science council gave top priority to the development of  a "Japan National Large Telescope" (JNLT), and in 1986, the University of Tokyo signed an agreement with the [[University of Hawaii]] to build the telescope in Hawaii. In 1988, the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan was formed through a reorganization of the University's Tokyo Astronomical Observatory, to oversee the JNLT and other large national astronomy projects.&lt;ref name=performance&gt;{{Citation |url=http://optik2.mtk.nao.ac.jp/~iye/papers/iye208.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722073446/http://optik2.mtk.nao.ac.jp/~iye/papers/iye208.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-22 |title=Current Performance and On-Going Improvements of the 8.2m Subaru Telescope |arxiv=astro-ph/0405012 |journal=Publ.

Construction of the Subaru telescope began in April 1991, and later that year, a public contest gave the telescope its official name, "Subaru Telescope." Construction was completed in 1998, and the first scientific images were taken in January 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naoj.org/NAOJ/history.html |title=A Brief History of Subaru |publisher=Naoj.org |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1999, [[Princess Sayako]] of Japan dedicated the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=French |first=Howard W. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/19/world/on-hawaii-a-telescope-widens-orbit-of-japanese.html |title=On Hawaii, A Telescope Widens Orbit Of Japanese |location=Japan; Hawaii; Mount Mauna Kea (Hawaii) |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1999-09-19 |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of state-of-the-art technologies were worked into the telescope design. For example, 261 computer-controlled actuators press the main mirror from underneath, which corrects for primary mirror distortion caused by changes in the telescope orientation. The telescope enclosure building is also shaped to improve the quality of astronomical images by minimizing the effects caused by atmospheric turbulence.

Subaru is one of the few state-of-the-art telescopes to have ever been used with the naked eye. For the dedication, an eyepiece was constructed so that Princess Sayako could look through it directly. It was enjoyed by the staff for a few nights until it was replaced with the much more sensitive working instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2009/07/telescopes/ferris-text |title=Cosmic Vision |journal=National Geographic |date=July 2009 |first=Timothy |last=Ferris |accessdate=2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subaru is the primary tool in the search for [[Planet Nine]]. Its large field of view, 75 times that of the Keck telescopes, and strong light-gathering power are suited for deep wide-field sky surveys. The search, split between a research group led by Batygin and Brown and another led by Sheppard and Trujillo, is expected to take up to five years.&lt;ref name="sciencemag201601"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/feature-astronomers-say-neptune-sized-planet-lurks-unseen-solar-system|title=Astronomers say a Neptune-sized planet lurks beyond Pluto|last=Hand|first=Eric|date=20 January 2016|work=Science|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accidents during construction ===
Two separate incidents claimed the lives of four workers during the construction of the telescope. On October 13, 1993, 42-year-old Paul F. Lawrence was fatally injured when a forklift tipped over onto him.  On January 16, 1996, sparks from a welder ignited insulation which smoldered, generating noxious smoke that killed Marvin Arruda, 52, Ricky Del Rosario, 38, and Warren K. "Kip" Kaleo, 36, and sent twenty-six other workers to the hospital in Hilo. All four workers are memorialized by a plaque outside the base of the telescope dome and a sign posted temporarily each January along the Mauna Kea access road.

===Mishap in 2011===
On July 2, 2011, the telescope operator in Hilo noted an anomaly from the top unit of the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universetoday.com/87245/subaru-8-meter-telescope-damaged-by-leaking-coolant/|title=SUBARU 8-METER TELESCOPE DAMAGED BY LEAKING COOLANT|last=Atkinson|first=Nancy|date=24 December 2015|work=Universe Today|access-date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon further examination, coolant from the top unit was found to have leaked over the primary mirror and other parts of the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://subarutelescope.org/Announce/2011/07/04/report1.html |title=Serious Hardware Incident with the Subaru Telescope Interrupts Its Operation |publisher=web-subarutelescope.org/ |accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Observation using Nasmyth foci resumed on July 22, and Cassegrain focus resumed on August 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://subarutelescope.org/Announce/2011/07/04/report4.html |title=Report 4: Resumption of Open Use Observations at Cassegrain Focus |date=September 13, 2011 |author=National Astronomical Observatory of Japan |accessdate=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several cameras and spectrographs can be mounted at Subaru Telescope's four focal points for observations in visible and infrared wavelengths.

; Multi-Object Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (MOIRCS) : Wide-field camera and spectrograph with the ability to take spectra of multiple objects simultaneously, mounts at the Cassegrain focus.
; Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) : Used in conjunction with the new 188-element adaptive optics unit (AO188), mounted at the infrared Nasmyth focus.
; Cooled Mid Infrared Camera and Spectrometer (COMICS) : Mid-infrared camera and spectrometer with the ability to study cool interstellar dust, mounts on the Cassegrain focus.
; Faint Object Camera And Spectrograph (FOCAS) : Visible-light camera and spectrograph with the ability to take spectra of up to 100 objects simultaneously, mounts on the Cassegrain focus.
; Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) : 80-megapixel wide-field visible-light camera, mounts at the prime focus.  Superseded by the Hyper Suprime-Cam in 2012, decommissioned in May 2017.
; High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) : Visible-light spectrograph mounted at the optical Nasmyth focus.
; Fiber Multi Object Spectrograph ([[FMOS]]) : Infrared spectrograph using movable fiber optics to take spectra of up to 400 objects simultaneously.  Mounts at the prime focus.
; High-Contrast Coronographic Imager for Adaptive Optics (HiCIAO) : Infrared camera for hunting planets around other stars. Used with AO188, mounted at the infrared Nasmyth focus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15529">[[File:USS Tanager (AM-5).jpg|thumb|USS ''Tanager'' (AM-5)]]

The '''''Tanager''''' '''Expedition''' was a series of five [[biological survey]]s of the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] conducted in partnership between the [[Bureau of Biological Survey]] and the [[Bishop Museum]], with the assistance of the [[U.S. Navy]]. Four expeditions occurred from April to August 1923, and a fifth in July 1924.  Led by [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Samuel Wilder King]] on the minesweeper {{USS|Tanager|AM-5}}, and [[Alexander Wetmore]] directing the team of scientists, the expedition studied the plant&lt;ref&gt;Christophersen &amp; Caum 1931&lt;/ref&gt; animal life, and [[geology]] of the central Pacific islands.  Noted members of the team include archaeologist [[Kenneth Emory]] and [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] [[Chapman Grant]].

The expedition began with the goal of exterminating [[domestic rabbit]]s that had been introduced to [[Laysan]] island by the guano industry in 1902.  Since that time, the rabbits had devoured Laysan's vegetation and led to the extinction of several endemic species.  The rabbits were eventually eliminated on Laysan, and the crew witnessed the extinction of the [[Laysan honeycreeper]] ({{okina}}apapane).  Throughout the expedition, new species were discovered and named, and unique specimens were captured and returned to laboratories for further study.  Over 100 [[Archaeology|archaeological]] sites were found, including ancient religious sites and prehistoric settlements on [[Nihoa]] and [[Necker Island (Hawaii)|Necker Island]].

==First expedition==
The first expedition departed Honolulu on April 4, 1923 and returned on May 4.&lt;ref name="Thrum-91"&gt;Thrum 1923, p.92&lt;/ref&gt;  The team visited the island of [[Laysan]], [[Pearl and Hermes Atoll]], [[Midway Atoll]], and [[Kure Atoll]].  When they spent a month on [[Laysan]] studying the endemic [[Laysan honeycreeper]], a violent and sudden storm ravaged the island. After the storm, the crew concluded that the last three specimens of the honeycreeper had been killed.

==Third expedition==
The third expedition departed Honolulu on June 9.&lt;ref name="Thrum-91" /&gt;   The team visited the islands of [[Necker Island (Northwestern Hawaiian Islands)|Necker]], [[Nihoa]], and the [[French Frigate Shoals]].  An attempt was also made to visit [[Kaʻula|Kaula]].  ''Tanager'' arrived at Nihoa on June 10 and dropped off scientists for a ten-day visit and moved on to Necker the following day to drop off a second team.  Both teams used radio to keep in constant communication between the two islands.&lt;ref&gt;Evenhuis &amp; Eldredge 2004, p.47&lt;/ref&gt;  On Nihoa, botanist Edward Leonard Caum collected the first specimen of ''[[Amaranthus brownii]]'' and  Alexander Wetmore discovered the [[Nihoa millerbird]] and named it ''Acrocephalus familiaris kingi'', in honor of Captain [[Samuel Wilder King]].&lt;ref&gt;Rauzon 2001, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of an ancient settlement on Nihoa was discovered, along with platforms, terraces, and human remains.&lt;ref name="Emory"&gt;Emory 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, the ''Tanager'' arrived in the French Frigate Shoals and remained for six days, completing the first comprehensive survey of the atoll.&lt;ref&gt;Amerson 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  The expedition returned to Honolulu on July 1.&lt;ref name="Thrum-91" /&gt;

==Fourth expedition==
The fourth expedition consisted of two teams, with the first departing Honolulu on July 7.&lt;ref name="Thrum-91" /&gt;  Destinations included [[Johnston Atoll]] and [[Wake Island]].  The first team left on the [[USS Whippoorwill (AM-35)|''Whippoorwill'' (AM-35)]], which made the first survey of [[Johnston Island]] in the 20th century.  Aerial survey and mapping flights over Johnston were conducted with a [[Douglas DT]]-2 [[floatplane]] carried on her fantail, which was hoisted into the water for take off.  Two destroyer convoys accompanied the expedition from Honolulu.  The [[USS Tanager (AM-5)|''Tanager'' (AM-5)]] left Honolulu on July 16 and joined up with the ''Whippoorwill'' to complete the survey.  From July 27 to August 5, the expedition surveyed Wake Island and named its islets: The southwest islet was named after [[Charles Wilkes]] who had led the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] in 1841 and determined the location of Wake Island.  The northwest islet was named after [[Titian Peale]], the chief naturalist for the 1841 expedition.

==Repatriation==
In 1990, the U.S. congress passed the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] which requires federal agencies and institutions that receive federal funding to return Native American cultural items and human remains to their people.  In the 1990s, '''Hui Mālama''' (Hui Mālama I Na Kūpuna O Hawai{{okina}}i Nei), a [[Native Hawaiian]] group, spent two years petitioning the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] for the release of the bones (''iwi'') from seven Hawaiian skeletons originally taken from Nihoa and Necker Island by the Tanager Expedition in 1924.  Although the bones were owned by the USFWS, the Bishop Museum acted as custodian.&lt;ref&gt;Rauzon 2001, pp.44-51&lt;/ref&gt;  The bones were finally released to the group, and in November, 1997, Hui Mālama chartered a yacht and travelled to Nihoa and Necker to [[Repatriation#Repatriation of human remains|rebury the remains]].&lt;ref&gt;Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources 2008, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mechanical Universe'''''...

The series was produced by Caltech and INTELECOM, a nonprofit consortium of California [[community college]]s now known as [[Intelecom Learning]],&lt;ref name="Intelecom"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.intelecom.org/our-story/|title=Our Story|work=Intelecom Learning|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; with financial support from [[Annenberg/CPB]].&lt;ref name="Goodstein" /&gt;

== Overview ==
Produced starting in 1982, the videos make heavy use of historical dramatizations and visual aids to explain physics concepts. The latter were state of the art at the time, incorporating almost 8 hours of [[computer animation]] created by [[computer graphics]] pioneer [[Jim Blinn]].&lt;ref name="Blinn91"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19900013645.pdf|title=Pictorial Communication in Virtual and Real Environments|first=Jim|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1991|isbn=978-0-7484-0008-9|editor-last=Ellis|editor-first=Stephen R.|location=|pages=|chapter=The making of ''The Mechanical Universe''|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|editor-last2=Kaiser|editor-first2=Mary K.|editor-last3=Grunwald|editor-first3=Arthur C.|author1=Blinn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fxguide.com/featured/founders-series-industry-legend-jim-blinn/|title=Founders Series: industry legend Jim Blinn|last=|first=|date=2012-07-24|work=[[fxguide]]|access-date=2017-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode opens and closes with bookend segments in which Caltech professor [[David Goodstein]], speaking in a lecture hall, delivers explanations "that can't quite be put into the mouth of our affable, faceless narrator".&lt;ref name="Goodstein"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodstein|first=David L.|last2=Olenick|first2=Richard P.|date=1988-09-01|title=Making ‘‘The Mechanical Universe’’|url=http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20151214-123255999|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=56|issue=9|pages=779–785|doi=10.1119/1.15485|issn=0002-9505|via=|bibcode=1988AmJPh..56..779G}}&lt;/ref&gt; After more than a quarter century, the series is still often used as a supplemental teaching aid, for its clear explanation of fundamental concepts such as [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.openculture.com/2017/05/the-pioneering-physics-tv-show-the-mechanical-universe-is-now-on-youtube-52-complete-episodes-from-caltech.html|title=The Pioneering Physics TV Show, The Mechanical Universe, Is Now on YouTube: 52 Complete Episodes from Caltech|work=Open Culture|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Meade|last=Brooks|year=2014|url=http://iws.collin.edu/mbrooks/documents/mechanical_universe/PHYS_1402_Physics_Videos.htm|title=PHYS-1402 Video Assignments|website=[[Collin College]]|access-date=2017-09-02}}&lt;br/&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physics.eou.edu/courses/phys_223/phys_223_lab1.pdf|title=PHYS 223 General Physics, Laboratory Session #1: Static Electricity|last=Tovar|first=Anthony A.|date=2013|website=[[Eastern Oregon University]]|access-date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bookend segments featuring Goodstein were specially staged versions of actual freshman physics lectures from Caltech's courses Physics 1a and 1b. The organization and the choice of topics to emphasize in the television show reflect a then-recent revision of Caltech's introductory physics curriculum, the first total overhaul since the one represented by ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' almost two decades earlier. While Feynman generally sought contemporary examples of topics, the later revision of the curriculum brought a more historical focus:&lt;blockquote&gt;In essence, the earlier Feynman course had sought to make physics exciting by relating each subject, wherever possible, to contemporary scientific problems. The new course took the opposite tack, of trying to recreate the historical excitement of the original discovery. For example, [[classical mechanics]]—a notoriously difficult and uninspiring subject for students—is treated as the discovery of "our place in the universe". Accordingly, [[celestial mechanics]] is the backbone of the subject and its climax is [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s solution of the [[Kepler problem]].&lt;ref name="Goodstein" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Production details==
The room seen in the bookend segments is the Bridge lecture hall at Caltech. Many of the extras were students from other schools, and the front rows of the lecture hall were deliberately filled with more women than would have typically been seen at Caltech lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/1226/1/1983_09_30_85_2.pdf|title=A Mechanical Filming|last=Whang|first=Ken|date=30 September 1983|work=The California Tech|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TV production team added fake wood paneling to the lecture hall so that it would more closely resemble that seen in the show ''[[The Paper Chase (TV series)|The Paper Chase]]''. Later, the Caltech physics department was sufficiently impressed by the result that panels were installed permanently.&lt;ref name="Goodstein" /&gt; Many seats in the lecture hall had to be removed in order to make room for the [[Camera dolly|camera track]] and studio lights. To cover this, additional reaction shots of a full lecture hall were filmed later, so that the illusion of a complete audience could be created in [[Film editing|editing]]. For most of the footage of Goodstein himself, only two rows of students were present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/3397/1/Physics.pdf|title=Physics on the Tube|last=|first=|date=November 1983|work=Engineering &amp; Science|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other video segments were shot on location, for example at a [[The Linde Group|Linde]] industrial plant that produced [[liquid air]]. Historical scenes were often made to be generic, in order to facilitate their reuse across multiple episodes: "Young Newton strolls through an apple orchard, old Newton testily refuses a cup of tea from a servant, and so on".&lt;ref name="Goodstein" /&gt; Footage featuring historical reenactment of [[Johannes Kepler]] was purchased from the [[Carl Sagan]] television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The series was originally planned to consist of 26 episodes.&lt;ref name="CTNews"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/2413/1/1982_12_16_07.pdf|title=The Mechanical Universe: Caltech develops a physics course for educational television|last=|first=|date=December 1982|work=Caltech News|access-date=23 June 2017|issue=7|volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gladstone|first=Daniel|date=1982|title=Caltech and Nebraska physicists produce college TV courses|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2914889|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=35|pages=56|doi=10.1063/1.2914889|via=|bibcode=1982PhT....35l..56G}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later expanded to 60 episodes, a number then cut back to the eventual total of 52 for budget and production-schedule reasons.&lt;ref name="Goodstein" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The new director of the Annenberg-Corporation for Public Broadcasting...|last=Shaw|first=Sydney|date=5 January 1984|work=UPI Archive: Washington News|access-date=|publisher=United Press International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was intended not to require previous experience with [[calculus]]. Instead, the basics of [[Differential calculus|differential]] and [[integral calculus]] would both be taught early in the series itself.&lt;ref name="CTNews" /&gt; Caltech mathematician [[Tom M. Apostol]] joined the ''Mechanical Universe'' production staff in order to ensure that the series did not compromise on the quality of the mathematics it presented. Seeing an example of Blinn's computer animation for the first time convinced Apostol that the series could bring mathematics "to life in a way that cannot be done in a textbook or at the chalkboard".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albers|first=Donald J.|last2=Apostol|first2=Tom|date=1997|title=An Interview with Tom Apostol|jstor=2687147|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=28|issue=4|pages=250–270|doi=10.2307/2687147}}&lt;/ref&gt; When test screenings to [[humanities]] students revealed that their greatest difficulty learning calculus was a weak background in [[trigonometry]], Apostol wrote a primer on the subject to be distributed with the telecourse.&lt;ref name="Goodstein" /&gt; After advising the production of ''The Mechanical Universe'', Apostol decided that a similar series, geared to high-school mathematics, would be beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-07/news/gl-42969_1_animated-computer-graphics|title=Animated Computer Graphics Give a New Angle to Math Education|last=Rollins|first=Bill|date=1993-10-07|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became the later Caltech series ''[[Project Mathematics!]]'', which also featured computer animation by Blinn. Some of Blinn's animations for ''The Mechanical Universe'' were reused in the new series, in order to illustrate applications of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the ''[[Project Mathematics!]]'' episode "Sines and Cosines, Part 1", [https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=25m5s&amp;v=9wh7xYMXKJ8 25:05 and following]. (Accessed 2018-01-28.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The science-fiction action movie [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'']] (1990) used portions of the ''Mechanical Universe'' title sequence, in a scene where the protagonist (Douglas Quaid, played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]) is offered virtual vacations in locales around the [[Solar System]]. The animation was used without licensing, and consequently, Caltech and Intelecom sued [[Carolco Pictures]] for [[United States dollar|$]]3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Schools sue Carolco over 'Recall'|last=|first=|date=3 September 1992|work=[[Daily Variety]]|access-date=|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to present detailed mathematical equation derivations, the show employed a technique its creators called the "algebraic ballet".&lt;ref name="Blinn91" /&gt; Computer animation presented derivations in step-by-step detail, but rapidly and with touches of whimsy, such as algebraic terms being canceled by a [[Monty Python]]-esque stomping foot or [[Michelangelo]]'s [[The Creation of Adam|Hand of God]]. Blinn felt that ''Cosmos'' had taken itself "too seriously", and so he aimed to include more humor in the ''Mechanical Universe'' animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-09/entertainment/ca-2683_1_computer-animation|title=Computer Animation And Physics :  Explaining Universe With Cartoons|last=Solomon|first=Charles|date=1987-01-09|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to avoid putting the viewers' "brains into a [[Mains hum|60-cycle hum]]", without sacrificing rigor; the creators intended that students could learn the overall gist of each derivation from the animation, and then study the details using the accompanying textbook.&lt;ref name="Goodstein" /&gt; Computer animation was also used to portray idealizations of physical systems, like simulated [[billiard ball]]s illustrating Newton's laws of motion. (Blinn had used some of the same software earlier to visualize the interaction of [[DNA]] and [[DNA polymerase]] for ''Cosmos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holzman|first=Robert E.|date=1986-07-01|title=Atoms to astronomy: Computer graphics at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01900326|journal=The Visual Computer|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=159–163|doi=10.1007/BF01900326|issn=0178-2789}}&lt;/ref&gt;) One commenter deemed these animations "particularly useful in providing students with subjective insights into dynamic three-dimensional phenomena such as [[magnetic field]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=S.R.|title=Nature and origins of virtual environments: a bibliographical essay|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0956-0521(91)90001-L|journal=Computing Systems in Engineering|volume=2|issue=4|pages=321–347|doi=10.1016/0956-0521(91)90001-l}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creating the computer graphics necessary to visualize physics concepts led Blinn to invent new techniques for simulating clouds, as well as the virtual "blobby objects" known as [[metaballs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://osu.pb.unizin.org/graphicshistory/chapter/4-5-jpl-and-national-research-council-of-canada/|title=4.6 JPL and National Research Council of Canada {{!}} Computer Graphics and Computer Animation: A Retrospective Overview|last=Carlson|first=Wayne E.|date=2017-06-20|website=[[Ohio State University]]|access-date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blinn used the vertex coordinates of [[Regular icosahedron|regular icosahedra]] and [[Regular dodecahedron|dodecahedra]] to determine the placement of [[electric field]] lines radiating away from point charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBDS6GAwSwAC|title=Jim Blinn's Corner: A Trip Down the Graphics Pipeline|last=Blinn|first=Jim|date=1996|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|year=|isbn=9781558603875|location=|pages=44|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the narration was voiced by actor Aaron Fletcher, who also played [[Galileo Galilei]] in the historical segments. Some portions, such as explanations of particular technical details, were narrated by Sally Beaty, the show's [[executive producer]].&lt;ref name="Goodstein" /&gt;

Shorter versions of ''Mechanical Universe'' episodes, 10 to 20 minutes in length, were created for use in [[Secondary school|high schools]]. This adaptation, for which a dozen high-school teachers and administrators were consultants, was supported by a $650,000 grant from the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sweet|first=William|date=1984|title=Foundations award new grants for video science productions|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2916409|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=37|pages=72|doi=10.1063/1.2916409|via=|bibcode=1984PhT....37R..72S}}&lt;/ref&gt; These videos were distributed alongside supplemental written material for teachers' benefit, and were intended to be employed in conjunction with existing textbooks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olenick|first=Richard P.|date=2016-12-02|title=The Development of Video Tapes for High School Physics Courses: The Mechanical Universe and beyond|url=https://doi.org/10.2190/WM1G-31MG-N9HA-YP38|journal=Journal of Educational Technology Systems|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=33–46|doi=10.2190/wm1g-31mg-n9ha-yp38}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yorkshire Television]] later produced a version repackaged for the United Kingdom audience, which was released in April 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=MREiAwAAQBAJ|title=Teaching Large Classes in Higher Education: How to Maintain Quality with Reduced Resources|last=Graham|first=Gibbs|last2=Alan|first2=Jenkins|date=2014-03-18|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135350420|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
===Initial responses===
PBS and [[The Learning Channel]] began broadcasting ''The Mechanical Universe'' in September 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1985|title=Caltech's Television Physics Course Starts to Air This Month|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2814699|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=38|pages=71|doi=10.1063/1.2814699|via=|bibcode=1985PhT....38S..71.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fall of 1986, roughly 100 PBS stations carried ''The Mechanical Universe,'' and by the fall of 1987, over 600 higher-education institutions had purchased it or licensed the episodes for use.&lt;ref name="Goodstein" /&gt; In 1992, Goodstein noted that the series had been broadcast, via PBS, by over 100 stations, "usually at peculiar hours when innocent people were unlikely to tune in accidentally on a [[differential equation]] in the act of being solved".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodstein|first=David|date=1992-09-01|title=The science literacy gap: A Karplus lecture|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00701360|journal=Journal of Science Education and Technology|language=en|volume=1|issue=3|pages=149–155|doi=10.1007/BF00701360|issn=1059-0145|bibcode=1992JSEdT...1..149G}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that detailed viewership figures were difficult to obtain, but when the show had been broadcast in [[Miami]] during Saturday mornings, the producers were able to obtain [[Nielsen ratings]].&lt;blockquote&gt;In fact, it came in second in its time slot, beating the [[Saturday-morning cartoon|kiddie cartoons]] on two network stations. There were 18,000 faithful core households in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] alone, the median age of the viewers was 18, and half were female. However, we seldom get that kind of detailed information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Goodstein and assistant project director Richard Olenick noted,&lt;blockquote&gt;Anecdotal information in the form of letters and phone calls indicates very considerable enthusiasm among users at all levels from casual viewers to high-school students to research university professors, but there have also been a number of sharp disappointments, particularly when [[Instructional Television Fixed Service|Instructional Television]] administrators have tried to handle TMU like a conventional telecourse.&lt;ref name="Goodstein" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Similarly, a 1988 review in ''[[Physics Today]]'' suggested that the programs would not function well on their own as a telecourse, but would work much better as a supplement to a traditional classroom or a more standard distance-learning course such as [[Open University]].&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Larry D.|last2=Wheeler|first2=Gerald F.|date=1988|title=The Mechanical Universe Telecourse|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2811531|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=41|pages=74|bibcode=1988PhT....41h..74K|doi=10.1063/1.2811531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewers also found the "algebraic ballet" of computer-animated equations too fast to follow: "After a short time, one yearns for a live professor filling the blackboard with equations".&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick" /&gt; Similarly, a review in the ''[[American Journal of Physics]]'', while praising the "technical proficiency of the films", wrote of the animated equation manipulations, "As the [[MIT]] students say, this is like trying to take a drink of water out of a fire hose".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olenick|first=Richard P.|last2=Apostol|first2=Tom M.|last3=Goodstein|first3=David L.|last4=Arons|first4=A.

Holbrow]], who told Olenick, "These materials will constitute the principal visual image of physics for decades".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Goodstein and Olenick reported that younger viewers tended to enjoy the "algebraic ballet" style "much more than older viewers, who are made uncomfortable by the algebraic manipulations they cannot quite follow".&lt;ref name="Goodstein" /&gt;

===Classroom use===
In 1986, ''The Mechanical Universe'' was used as part of a summer program for [[gifted children]], to overall success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tkach|first=John R.|date=1987|title=A Perennial Problem for Parents: What to Do with a Gifted Kid This Summer II|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/107621758701000302|journal=Gifted Child Today Magazine|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=6–8|doi=10.1177/107621758701000302|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1987 study at [[Indiana University Bloomington]] used 14 ''Mechanical Universe'' episodes as part of an introductory course on Newtonian mechanics, with generally positive results:&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]hese tapes were particularly effective in placing Newtonian mechanics in a historical perspective; dramatizing the historical overthrow of [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian]] and medieval ideas; illustrating the diverse nature of scientists and the scientific endeavor; stimulating student interest and enthusiasm; and, through excellent animation, illustrating the time dimension of certain mechanics concepts. The companion text [...] was placed on library reserve for the course but was not extensively utilized by students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hake|first=R.

== Portrayal of Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse ==
{{Main|Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)}}
Like many introductory physics texts, ''The Mechanical Universe'' cites the spectacular 1940 collapse of the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]] as an example of [[resonance]], using footage of the disaster in the "Resonance" episode. However, as more-recent expositions have emphasized, the catastrophic oscillations that destroyed the bridge were not due to simple mechanical resonance, but to a more complicated interaction between the bridge and the winds passing through it—a phenomenon known as [[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic flutter]]. This phenomenon is a kind of "self-sustaining vibration" that lies beyond the regime of applicability of the [[Linear differential equation|linear theory]] of the externally-driven [[Simple harmonic motion|simple harmonic oscillator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Billah|first=K. Yusuf|last2=Scanlan|first2=Robert H.|date=1991-02-01|title=Resonance, Tacoma Narrows bridge failure, and undergraduate physics textbooks|url=http://www.ketchum.org/billah/Billah-Scanlan.pdf|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=59|issue=2|pages=118–124|doi=10.1119/1.16590|issn=0002-9505|via=|bibcode=1991AmJPh..59..118B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Donald W.|last2=Wolf|first2=Steven F.|last3=Hook|first3=Joseph M.|date=2015-10-31|title=The Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.2991|journal=Physics Today|volume=68|issue=11|pages=64–65|doi=10.1063/PT.3.2991|issn=0031-9228|bibcode=2015PhT....68k..64O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of episodes==
The opening sequence used for the first 26 episodes lists the show's title as ''The Mechanical Universe'', whereas the latter 26 episodes are titled ''The Mechanical Universe ...and Beyond''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Introduction|series=The Mechanical Universe|network=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the addition is explained by Goodstein in the closing lecture segment of the final episode: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the first scientific revolution, disputation over the interpretation of human or divine authority was replaced by observation, by measurement, by the testing of hypotheses, all of it with the powerful help of quantitative mathematical reasoning. And the result of all that was the mechanical universe, a universe that inexorably worked out its destiny according to precise, predictable, mechanical laws. Today, we no longer believe in that universe. If I know the precise position of some particle at some instant of time, I cannot have ''any idea'' of where it's going or how fast. And it doesn't make any difference at all if you say, "All right, you don't ''know'' where it's going, but where is it ''really'' going?" That is precisely the kind of question that is scientifically meaningless. That is the nature of the world we live in. That is the quantum mechanical universe.&lt;ref&gt;"The Quantum Mechanical Universe" (episode 52), 25:37 and following.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The series can be purchased from Caltech or streamed from online video sources, including Caltech's official [[YouTube]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacIsaac|first=Dan|date=January 2017|title="The Mechanical Universe and Beyond" series now freely available on YouTube|url=|journal=[[The Physics Teacher]]|volume=55|pages=126|doi=10.1119/1.4974137|via=|bibcode=2017PhTea..55T.126.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech also posted on YouTube a series of short videos made by Blinn to demonstrate the show's computer animation at [[SIGGRAPH]] conferences.

==History==

===Early history===

In 1682, [[William Penn]] founded [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], planning it as a city to serve as a port on the Delaware River and as a place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a [[grid plan]] to keep houses and businesses spread far apart, with areas for gardens and orchards. The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, as they crowded by the Delaware River, the port, and subdivided and resold their lots.&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 7, 14 – 16&lt;/ref&gt; Before Penn left Philadelphia for the last time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city. It became an important trading center, poor at first, but with tolerable living conditions by the 1750s. [[Benjamin Franklin]], a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones, such as fire protection, a library, and one of the American colonies' first hospitals.

President [[George Washington]] appointed [[Pierre L'Enfant]] in 1791 to design the new capital city (later named [[Washington, D.C.|the City of Washington]]) under the supervision of three Commissioners, whom Washington had appointed to oversee the planning and development of the federal territory that would later become the [[History of Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name=Leach&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=97000332}}|title=L'Enfant  Plan of the City of Washington, District of Columbia|work=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form|publisher=[[United States Department of the Interior]]:  [[National Park Service]]|first=Sara Amy|last=Leach|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Barthold|date=1994-07-20|accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Jefferson]], who worked alongside President Washington in overseeing the plans for the capital, sent L'Enfant a letter outlining his task, which was to provide a drawing of suitable sites for the federal city and the public buildings.  Though Jefferson had modest ideas for the Capital, L'Enfant saw the task as far more grandiose, believing he was not only locating the capital, but also devising the city plan and designing the buildings.&lt;ref name="seale"&gt;{{cite book |last=Seale |first=William |title=The President's House, Volume 1 |publisher=White House Historical Association |year=1986 |pages=1&amp;ndash;4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dismissed by the Washington D.C. commission, L'Enfant's plan would not be revived and implemented until 1902, as part of the [[McMillan Plan|McMillan Commission]]'s efforts to rebuild the city.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/755061638|title=Planning and community development A guide for the 21st century|last=M.|first=Ward, Robert|date=2011|publisher=WW Norton &amp; Co|isbn=9780393732924|oclc=755061638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811, land for [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Central Park]] was acquired by the city through [[eminent domain]] and incorporated into the urban plan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-americas/us-art-19c/us-19c-arch-sculp-photo/a/olmsted-and-vaux-central-park|title=Olmsted and Vaux, Central Park|last=|first=|date=|website=Khan Academy|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of [[Seneca Village]], a settlement of free African Americans and German and Irish immigrants located on the future site of Central Park, were evicted by 1857.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], with the help of [[Calvert Vaux]], developed a design for Central Park, which was entered into the open competition held by the city, and subsequently won.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their plan was then successfully implemented by the city, and was opened to the public in the winter of 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ny.com/articles/centralpark.html|title=History of Central Park, New York|website=www.ny.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The twentieth century ===
In 1909, the first National Conference on City Planning was held in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Jon A.|date=2009-03-27|title=The Birth of Organized City Planning in the United States, 1909–1910|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944360802608484|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=75|issue=2|pages=123–133|doi=10.1080/01944360802608484|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominating the conference, Benjamin C. Marshall urged the government to conduct a 'civic census' to study the state of American cities, educate the public on its findings, and establish a national city-planning committee.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

[[Daniel Burnham]] was commissioned by the Chicago Merchants Association to lead a team to plan Chicago's [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1933, the National Planning Board was established.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson established the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Vanishing-dimensions theory''' is a [[particle physics]] theory suggesting that systems with higher energy have a smaller number of [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensions]].

For example, the theory implies that the [[Universe]] had fewer dimensions after the [[Big Bang]] when its energy was high. Then the number of dimensions may have increased as the system cooled and the Universe may gain more dimensions with time. There could have originally been only one [[spatial dimension]], with two dimensions total&amp;nbsp;— one [[temporal dimension|time dimension]] and one space dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atramateria.com/the-vanishing-dimensions-of-the-universe/|title=The vanishing dimensions of the Universe|date=March 22, 2011|publisher=Astra Materia|last1=Corbion|first1=Ashley|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When there were only two dimensions, the Universe lacked gravitational degrees of freedom.&lt;ref name="arxiv"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1304.6444|title=Vanishing dimensions: theory and phenomenology|last1=Stojkovic|first1=Dejan|date=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory is also tied to smaller amount of dimensions in smaller systems with the universe expansion being a suggested motivating phenomenon for growth of the number of dimensions with time,&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110420152059.htm|title=Primordial Weirdness: Did the Early Universe Have One Dimension?

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Dejan Stojkovic from the [[University at Buffalo]] and Jonas Mureika from the [[Loyola Marymount University]] described use of a [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna]] system, intended to detect [[gravitational wave]]s, to test the vanishing-dimension theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Stojkovic|first1=Dejan|last2=Mureika|first2=Jonas|date=March 8, 2011|journal=Physical Review Letters|title=Detecting Vanishing Dimensions via Primordial Gravitational Wave Astronomy|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.101101|arxiv = 1102.3434 |bibcode = 2011PhRvL.106j1101M|volume=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; by detecting a maximum frequency after which gravitational waves can't be observed.

The vanishing-dimensions theory is seen as an explanation to [[cosmological constant]] problem: a fifth dimension would answer the question of energy density required to maintain the constant.&lt;ref name="arxiv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lhc"/&gt;

The '''Voskhod rocket''' ({{lang-ru|Восход}}, ''"ascent"'', ''"dawn"'') was a derivative of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] [[ICBM]] designed for the [[human spaceflight]] [[Voskhod programme|programme]] but later used for launching [[Zenit (satellite)|Zenit]] [[reconnaissance satellite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barensky|first1=C.

The Blok I stage in the Voskhod booster used the RD-107 engine rather than the RD-110 in the Soyuz, which was more powerful and also man-rated. The sole exception to this were the two manned Voskhod launches, which had RD-108 engines, a man-rated RD-107 but with the same performance.

All 11A57s launched after 1965 were functionally an 11A511 without the Soyuz's [[payload shroud]] and [[launch escape system]] (with the exception of the third stage propulsion system as noted above). Around 300 were flown from Baikonur and Plesetsk through 1976 (various payloads, but Zenith [[Photointelligence|PHOTINT]] satellites were the most common). The newer 11A511U core had been introduced in 1973, but the existing stock of 11A57s took another three years to use up.

'''''Zoo Parade''''' is an American television program broadcast from 1950 to 1957 that featured animals from the [[Lincoln Park Zoo]] in [[Chicago]]. The program's host was [[Marlin Perkins]], the Zoo's director. Perkins went on to host the program ''[[Wild Kingdom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cech |first=John |title=Zoo Parade |date=May 31, 2004 |work=Recess! |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Wehmeyer has described the show: "A precursor of sorts to the regularly featured animal segments on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and other late-night talk shows, ''Zoo Parade'' was a location-bound production (filmed in the reptile house basement) during which Perkins would present and describe the life and peculiarities of Lincoln Park Zoo animals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wehmeyer |first=Jim |title=Wild Kingdom |publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcel LaFollette has written, "Production approaches that are now standard practice on ''[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]'' and the [[Discovery Channel]] derive, in fact, from experimentation by television pioneers like [[Lynn Poole]] and [[Don Herbert]] and such programs as ''[[Adventure (TV series)|Adventure]]'', ''Zoo Parade'', ''[[Science in Action (TV series)|Science in Action]]'', and the [[The Bell Laboratory Science Series|Bell Telephone System’s science specials]]. These early efforts were also influenced by television’s love of the dramatic, refined during its first decade and continuing to shape news and public affairs programming, as well as fiction and fantasy, today."&lt;ref name=LaFollette02&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Survey of Science Content in U.S. Television Broadcasting, 1940s through 1950s: The Exploratory Years |first=Marcel C. |last=LaFollette |journal=Science Communication |date=September 2002 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=34–71 |doi=10.1177/107554700202400103 |url=http://scx.sagepub.com/content/24/1/34.abstract }} No free online access.&lt;/ref&gt;
