__NOTOC__
'''5x5=25''' was a two-part [[abstract art]] exhibition held in September–October 1921 in [[Moscow]]. The five artists whose work was shown were [[Aleksandra Ekster]], [[Lyubov Popova]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]], [[Varvara Stepanova]] and [[Alexander Vesnin]]. They presented highly abstracted, geometric work that rejected [[expressionist]] forms of painting common before the [[World War I]] and pretended to be the "end" or "death" of art.

Rodchenko presented three canvases of a single colour (red, yellow and blue). He saw that his formal research into [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] had reached completion at this point, and claimed that he had demonstrated the "end of painting".&lt;ref name="artdaily"&gt;[http://www.artdaily.org/section/news/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=26647&amp;int_modo=1 Art Daily article on Rodchenko and his role in Constructivism]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition has been considered an anti-painting manifesto.&lt;ref name="artprof"&gt;[http://www.artprofessor.com/artists/alexander-rodchenko.php Art Professor article on Alexander Rodchenko]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

Lyubov Popova showed canvasses almost bare, puzzling viewers and provoking hail from the critics. Her "flight from painting" influenced [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]].&lt;ref name=AA&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/drawing-a-blank-russian-constructivist-makes-late-tate-debut-1516801.html | title=Drawing a blank: Russian constructivist makes late Tate debut | publisher=[[The Independent]] | author=Arifa Akbar | accessdate=2009-06-25 | location=London | date=January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popova herself did not regard her works as "the end"; on the contrary, she wrote, "all pieces presented here should be regarded as merely preparations for concrete construction".&lt;ref&gt;Gleason, Kenez, Stites, pp. 208-209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Vesnin presented five&lt;ref name=KM92&gt;Khan-Magomedov, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; abstract [[cubism|cubist]] canvases that appear pure abstractions but were, in fact, ultimate decomposition of human figures.&lt;ref name=KM92/&gt; Vesnin's catalogue cover, in particular, is typical of his book and advertising art of the period:  numbers in two "lines" (5x5 and 25) are offset against the baseline, but this irregularity is "disguised" by angled lines dissecting the space.&lt;ref name=KM93&gt;Khan-Magomedov, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catalogues of the exhibition were hand-drawn by the artists and contained original artwork that has never been displayed publicly. At least ten unique albums survive in Russia to date.&lt;ref name=KM92/&gt; The 1921 show was reconstructed in 2009 in London's [[Tate|Tate Gallery]]. Modern critics remain divided over the question of whether "death of painting" was a genuine statement of modern art or, indeed, it was a dead end with no future.&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

'''The aestheticization of politics''' was an idea first coined by [[Walter Benjamin]] as being a key ingredient to [[Fascist]] regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jay|first=Martin|year=1992|title="The Aesthetic Ideology" as Ideology; Or, What Does It Mean to Aestheticize Politics?|journal=Cultural Critique|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|issue=21|jstor=1354116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, life and the affairs of living are conceived of as innately [[art]]istic, and related to as such politically. [[Politics]] are in turn viewed as artistic, and structured like an [[art form]] which reciprocates the artistic conception of life being seen as art.

This has also been noted as being connected to the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]] movement and postulated as its main motivation for getting involved in the Fascist regime of [[Italy]].

Alternately, "[[politicization of aesthetics]]" (or "politicization of art") has been used as a term for an [[ideology|ideologically]] opposing synthesis, sometimes associated with the [[Soviet Union]], wherein art is ultimately subordinate to political life and thus a result of it, separate from it, but which is attempted to be incorporated for political use as theory relating to the consequential political nature of art. The author [[Emilio Gentile]] has stressed that these two ideas are not mutually exclusive, and both regimes had a large degree of the other. In Benjamin's original formulation, however, the politicization of aesthetics was treated conceptually as the polar opposite of the aestheticization of politics, the former treated as a kind of revolutionary praxis, redeeming force, or "antidote" to the corrupting fascistic influence of the latter.

The '''Arts Party''' is an international political movement, inspired by the importance of the Arts and creative action, with parties currently registered in [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/parties_and_representatives/party_registration/Registered_parties/ | title=Current Register of Political Parties}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Kingdom|England, Scotland and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Registrations/PP6393 | title=UK Electoral Commission Registration Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Australian party was founded in October 2013 by two [[Sydney]]-based artists, [[PJ Collins]] and [[Nicholas Gledhill]],&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Mimo (7 November 2013). [http://www.altmedia.net.au/sydney-artists-form-new-political-party/86147 "Sydney artists form new political party"] – altmedia. Retrieved 19 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and registered by the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] (AEC) in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fbiradio.com/introducing-the-australian-arts-party/ | title=FBI Radio: Introducing the Australian Arts Party}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsparty.org/ | title=The Arts Party Official Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; Money was raised for the party's registration through a [[Crowdfunding|crowd-funding campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-australian-arts-party | title=Arts Party crowd-funding campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Arts Party members stood as [[Independent politician|independent]] candidates at the [[Queensland state election, 2015|2015 Queensland state election]], as the party had not been registered in time to contest the election.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Stone (21 January 2015). [http://www.artshub.com.au/news-article/news/all-arts/deborah-stone/arts-party-candidates-run-as-independents-in-queensland-246924 "Arts party candidates run as independents in Queensland"] – ArtsHub. Retrieved 19 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, the party's leader, [[PJ Collins]], stood as an ungrouped [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] candidate at the [[New South Wales state election, 2015|2015 New South Wales state election]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Stone (23 February 2015). [http://www.artshub.com.au/news-article/news/all-arts/deborah-stone/arts-party-leader-stands-for-nsw-parliament-247225 "Arts Party Leader stands for NSW Parliament"] – ArtsHub. Retrieved 19 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official Arts Party candidate was Lou Pollard in the [[North Sydney by-election, 2015|2015 North Sydney by-election]],&lt;ref&gt;The Music Network [https://www.themusicnetwork.com/news/arts-party-to-contest-north-sydney-by-election "ARTS PARTY TO CONTEST NORTH SYDNEY BY-ELECTION"]&lt;/ref&gt; who came eighth in a field of 13 candidates.

The Arts Party fielded seven candidates for the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and thirteen [[Australian Senate|senate]] candidates across all states in the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]].&lt;ref name="2016candidates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/HouseCandidates-20499.htm |title=Candidates for the 2016 federal election |date=11 June 2016 |access-date=11 June 2016 |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, the entire campaign was financed through a [[Crowdfunding|crowd-funding campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pozible.com/project/204920 | title=Pozible - Arts Party Federal Campaign by PJ Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] candidates were [[Anthony Ackroyd]] in the electorate of [[Division of Wentworth|Wentworth]] (NSW),&lt;ref name="Wentworth NSW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/HouseDivisionPage-20499-152.htm |title=Wentworth, NSW Results |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shea Caplice in the electorate of [[Division of Warringah|Warringah]] (NSW),&lt;ref name="Warringah NSW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/HouseDivisionPage-20499-151.htm |title=Warringah, NSW Results |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Sanderson in the electorate of [[Division of Franklin|Franklin]] (Tasmania),&lt;ref name="Franklin TAS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/HouseDivisionPage-20499-195.htm |title=Franklin, TAS Results |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Gordon in the electorate of [[Division of Bennelong|Bennelong]] (NSW0,&lt;ref name="Bennelong NSW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/HouseDivisionPage-20499-105.htm |title=Bennelong NSW Results |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally Baillieu in the electorate of [[Division of Dunkley|Dunkley]] (Victoria),&lt;ref name="Dunkley VIC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/HouseDivisionPage-20499-210.htm |title=Dunkley VIC Results |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Beck in the electorate of [[Division of Longman|Longman]] (Queensland)&lt;ref name="Longman QLD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/HouseDivisionPage-20499-302.htm |title=DLongman QLD Results |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Andrew Charles Tyrrell in the electorate of [[Division of Petrie|Petrie]] (Queensland).&lt;ref name="Petrie QLD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/HouseDivisionPage-20499-175.htm |title=Petrie QLD Results |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In voting for the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], the party ranked nationally 28th out of 55 parties, based on first preference votes by group,&lt;ref name="Senate Results"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-20499-NAT.htm |title=Senate First Preferences By Group Results |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; receiving over 1.5million preference votes between 1st and 6th place.&lt;ref name="Senate Results Downloads"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/SenateDownloadsMenu-20499-Csv.htm |title=Senate Preferences Downloads |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They patented an improved [[cinematograph]], which in contrast to [[Thomas Edison]]'s "peepshow" [[kinetoscope]] allowed simultaneous viewing by multiple parties.{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==History==
The Lumière brothers were born in [[Besançon]], [[France]], to Charles-Antoine Lumière (1840–1911)&lt;ref name="vc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/antoinelumiere|title=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema|website=www.victorian-cinema.net|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jeanne Joséphine Costille Lumière, who were married in 1861 and moved to Besançon, setting up a small photographic portrait studio where Auguste and Louis were born. They moved to [[Lyon]] in 1870, where son Edouard and three daughters were born. Auguste and Louis both attended [[La Martiniere Lyon|La Martiniere]], the largest technical school in Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Motion Pictures | author = Gina De Angelis | publisher = The Oliver Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-1-881508-78-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=daHmkclqERYC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=Lumi%C3%A8re+Besan%C3%A7on+Lyon&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=eqdfSaiYK4PAlQTF4tj7BQ#PPA34,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their father Charles-Antoine set up a small factory producing photographic plates, but even with Louis and a young sister working from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. it teetered on the verge of bankruptcy, and by 1882 it looked as if they would fail, but when Auguste returned from military service the boys designed the machines necessary to automate their father's plate production and devised a very successful new photo plate, 'etiquettes bleue', and by 1884 the factory employed a dozen workers.

When their father retired in 1892 the brothers began to create moving pictures. They patented several significant processes leading up to their film camera, most notably [[film perforations]] (originally implemented by [[Emile Reynaud]]) as a means of advancing the film through the camera and projector. The original [[cinématographe]] had been patented by [[Léon Guillaume Bouly]] on 12 February 1892.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinematographes.free.fr/bouly-219350.html "Brevet FR 219.350"]. Cinematographes. Retrieved 13 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers patented their own version on 13 February 1895.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinematographes.free.fr/lumiere-245032.html "Brevet FR 245.032"]. Cinematographes. Retrieved 12 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The first footage ever to be recorded using it was recorded on 19 March 1895. This first film shows workers leaving the Lumière factory.

The Lumière brothers saw film as a novelty and had withdrawn from the film business in 1905. They went on to develop the first practical photographic colour process, the Lumière Autochrome.

Louis died on 6 June 1948 and Auguste on 10 April 1954. They are buried in a family tomb in the [[Guillotière Cemetery|New Guillotière Cemetery]] in Lyon.

==First film screenings==
The Lumières held their first private screening of projected motion pictures in 1895. This first screening on 22 March 1895 took place in Paris, at the "Society for the Development of the National Industry", in front of an audience of 200 people – among which [[Léon Gaumont]], then director of the company the Comptoir géneral de la photographie. The main focus of this conference by Louis Lumière were the recent developments in the photograph industry, mainly the research on polychromy (colour photography). It was much to Lumière's surprise that the moving black-and-white images retained more attention than the coloured stills photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Chardère 1985, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[Woodville Latham]] had screened works of film 2 months later on 20 May 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Paul. [http://precinemahistory.net/1895.htm "1895 Major Woodville Latham (1838–1911)"]. precinemahistory.net, October 1999. Retrieved 2 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The first public screening of films at which admission was charged was a program by the Skladanowsky brothers that was held on 1 November 1895, in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/skladanowsky|title=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema|website=www.victorian-cinema.net|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lumières gave their first paid public screening on 28 December 1895, at [[Salon Indien du Grand Café]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/presentation-du-cinematographe-lumiere/ 28 December 1895.]&lt;/ref&gt; This history-making presentation featured 10 short films, including their first film, ''[[Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory|Sortie des Usines Lumière à Lyon]]'' (''Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html "La première séance publique payante", Institut Lumière] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912104656/http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html |date=12 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each film is 17 meters long, which, when hand cranked through a projector, runs approximately 50 seconds.

[[File:Cinématographe Lumière.jpg|thumb|right|The world's first film poster, for 1895's ''[[L'Arroseur arrosé]]'']] It is believed their first film was recorded that same year (1895) with [[Léon Bouly]]'s [[cinematographe|cinématographe]] device, which was patented the previous year. The date of the recording of their first film is in dispute. In an interview with Georges Sadoul given in 1948, Louis Lumière tells that he shot the film in August 1894. This is questioned by historians (Sadoul, Pinel, Chardère) who consider that a functional Lumière camera didn't exist before the end of 1894, and that their first film was recorded 19 March 1895, and then publicly projected 22 March at the [[Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale]] in Paris. The cinématographe — a three-in-one device that could record, develop, and project [[film|motion picture]]s — was further developed by the Lumières.&lt;ref&gt;Chardère 1987, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The public debut at the Grand Café came a few months later and consisted of the following 10 short films (in order of presentation):&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050912104656/http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html "Bienvenue sur Adobe GoLive 4"].

The Lumières went on tour with the cinématographe in 1896, visiting [[Brussels]] (the first place a film was played outside Paris on the Galleries Saint-Hubert on 1 March 1896), [[Bombay]], [[London]], [[Montreal]], [[New York City]] and [[Buenos Aires]].

In 1896, only a few months after the initial screenings in Europe, films by the Lumiere Brothers were shown in [[Egypt]], first in the Tousson stock exchange in [[Alexandria]] on 5 November 1896 and then in the Hamam Schneider (Schneider Bath) in [[Cairo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=LmSFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=lumiere+brothers+in+alexandria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1-aFCap4s-&amp;sig=KEupQRN89byuwiqyXDGbYXi_N6E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJrJnZ-dnWAhVLL8AKHW4kCOwQ6AEIUDAL#v=onepage&amp;q=lumiere%20brothers%20in%20alexandria&amp;f=false|title=Companion Encyclopedia of Middle Eastern and North African Film|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|date=2003-12-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134662524|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bibalex.org/alexcinema/historical/beginnings.html|title=Alexandria, Why? (The Beginnings of the Cinema Industry in Alexandria)|publisher=Bibliotheca Alexandrina's AlexCinema}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The moving images had an immediate and significant influence on popular culture with ''[[L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat]]'' (literally, "the arrival of a train at La Ciotat", but more commonly known as ''Arrival of a Train at a Station'') and ''[[Carmaux, défournage du coke]]'' (Drawing out the coke). Their [[actuality film]]s, or ''actualités'', are often cited as the first, primitive [[Documentary film|documentaries]]. They also made the first steps towards comedy film with the slapstick of ''[[L'Arroseur Arrosé]]''.

==Early colour photography==
[[File:LumiereAlgerijnen.jpg|thumb|Autochrome colour picture by [[Jean-Baptiste Tournassoud]] of North-African soldiers, Oise, France, 1917.]]
{{Main article|Autochrome Lumière}}

The brothers stated that "the [[film|cinema]] is an [[invention]] without any future" and declined to sell their camera to other filmmakers such as [[Georges Méliès]]. This made many film makers upset. Consequently, their role in the history of film was exceedingly brief. In parallel with their cinema work they experimented with colour photography. They worked on a number of colour photographic processes in the 1890s including the Lippmann process (interference heliochromy) and their own 'bichromated glue' process,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ignomini.com/photographica/stereophotovintage/Trichrome/Lumiere_Trichrome.html "Lumiere Trichrome"]. ignomini.com. Retrieved 2 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; a subtractive colour process, examples of which were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900. This last process was commercialised by the Lumieres but commercial success had to wait for their next colour process. In 1903 they patented a colour photographic process, the ''[[Autochrome Lumière]]'', which was launched on the market in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Lavédrine and Gandolfo 2013, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout much of the 20th century, the Lumière company was a major producer of photographic products in Europe, but the brand name, Lumière, disappeared from the marketplace following merger with [[Ilford Photo|Ilford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdx.rhonealpes.fr/sdx/sribzh/main.xsp?execute=show_document&amp;id=MERIMEEIA69000030 "City of Lyon Document"]. sdx.rhonealpes.fr. Retrieved 2 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; They also invented the colour plate, which really got photography on the road.

==Other early cinematographers==
The Lumière Brothers were not the only ones to claim the title of the first cinematographers. The scientific [[chronophotography]] devices developed by [[Eadweard Muybridge]], [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] and [[Ottomar Anschütz]] in the 1880s were able to produce moving photographs, and [[William Friese-Greene]]'s "machine camera", patented in 1889, did so on a strip of film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/friesegreene|title=William Friese-Greene|last=|first=|date=|website=www.victorian-cinema.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[Kinetoscope]] (developed by [[William Kennedy Dickson]]), premiered publicly in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/when_chrono|title=Chronology of Film Shows pre-1896|last=|first=|date=|website=www.victorian-cinema.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1892, the projected drawings of [[Émile Reynaud]]'s [[Théâtre Optique]] were attracting Paris crowds to the Musée Grévin. [[Louis Le Prince]] and [[Claude Mechant]] had been shooting moving picture sequences on paper film as soon as 1888, but had never performed a public demonstration. Polish inventor, [[Kazimierz Prószyński]] had built his camera and projecting device, called [[Pleograph]], in 1894. [[Max Skladanowsky|Max and Emil Skladanowsky]], inventors of the [[Bioscop]], had offered projected moving images to a paying public one month earlier (1 November 1895, in [[Berlin]]). Nevertheless, film historians consider the Grand Café screening to be the true birth of the cinema as a commercial medium, because the Skladanowsky brothers' screening used an extremely impractical dual system motion picture projector that was immediately supplanted by the Lumiere cinematographe.&lt;ref&gt;Cook 2004, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Lumière brothers were not the first inventors to develop techniques to create motion pictures, they are often credited as among the first inventors of the technology for cinema as a mass medium, and are among the first who understood how to use it.

'''''The Bad News Bears''''' is an American [[sports film|sports]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[multi-media]] franchise created by screenwriter [[Bill Lancaster]]. It began in 1976 with ''[[The Bad News Bears]]'', and was followed by two sequels and a remake: ''[[The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training]]'' (1977), ''[[The Bad News Bears Go to Japan]]'' (1978) and ''[[Bad News Bears]]'' (2005).

While the first film garnered critical acclaim, critics were less enthusiastic about its sequels. Furthermore, the series has also had a lasting influence on both karate culture and [[teen film]] narratives in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forbes|first1=Bruce David|last2=Mahan|first2=Jeffrey H.|title=Religion and Popular Culture in America|date=November 17, 2005|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=[[Oakland, California]]|isbn=0520246896|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SaRJ2KkXSBQC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31 31]|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Driscoll|first1=Catherine|title=Teen Film: A Critical Introduction|date=June 1, 2011|publisher=[[Berg Publishers]]|location=[[Oxford]]|isbn=1847886868|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CB4NOZ2_NGQC&amp;pg=PT136 136]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bicycle tree''' or ''cycle tree'' or ''bike tree'' is a bicycle parking system that resembles a tree in shape.  There are a few types that have been developed.

Some are manual, some use mechanical means to move the bike, assisting the bike by raising into a particular spot, they can handle between 5-20 bicycles depending on size.  They are made by various companies in Europe and North America.  Still others, like the one made by JFE Steel of Japan, are fully automated and computerized and can handle and locate some 9,400 bicycles for example, underneath a major train station or university.

==Manual==
Various companies have developed simple bike trees, including ones for sale at a hardware store, such as Harbor Freight Tools, that have hooks to hang 5 bicycles.

==Mechanical assisted==

A Swiss company, [http://www.biketree.com/ Bike Tree International], designed a system whereby a bicycle can be hoisted into a tree-shaped device after lifting the front of the bike and connecting the wheel to a hook by rope.  There are plans to deploy this machine in [[Geneva]].  It can handle one or two dozen bicycles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biketree.com/ Bike Tree International Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automated storage and retrieval system==
A similar but much larger device, an [[automated storage and retrieval system]], has been developed by JFE Engineering, a unit of [[JFE Holdings]] of Japan.  The first bike tree of this type became available for public use in 2006, storing 1,476 bicycles using an [[integrated circuit]] based tag system, cleanly stored away above ground in an urban office-like building.&lt;ref name="jfe"&gt;[http://www.jfe-eng.co.jp/en/en_product/environment/environment2134.html JFE CYCLE TREE: Multi-level Mechanical Bicycle Parking System]&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical units have been expanded to hold some 6,480 bicycles, for which retrieval time is 23 seconds,&lt;ref name="jfe"/&gt; such as in this 15 meter deep underground storage facility.  Various municipalities in the [[Greater Tokyo]] area run the system or are planning to install them, charging 1800 yen per month for storage or a one time fee of 100 yen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2009/nov/05/japan-best-bike-shed Guardian:Has Japan designed the world's best bike shed?]&lt;/ref&gt;  As of February 2013, some 85 systems of this manufacturer and type in use can hold 17,323 bicycles, all in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jfe-eng.co.jp/en/products/machine/logistics/lo09.html&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Booze cruise''' is a British colloquial term for a brief trip from Britain to [[France]] or [[Belgium]] with the intent of taking advantage of lower prices, and buying personal supplies of (especially) [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] or [[tobacco]] in bulk quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2403437.stm |title=We're all going on a 'booze-cruise' holiday |work=[[BBC News]] |date=5 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a legally acceptable process and should not be confused with [[smuggling]].

The term is also used in other countries to refer to a pleasure outing on a ship or boat involving a significant amount of drinking, or an outing to purchase large amounts of alcohol in bulk for a party or outing. It probably originated during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], when Americans would take "cruises to nowhere" to enjoy alcohol, which could legally be served on board once outside American territorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/prohibition-americas-failed-noble-experiment/|title=Prohibition: America's Failed Noble Experiment|date=12 June 2012|publisher=cbsnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The background==
{{refimprove|date=April 2009}}
Generally, alcohol and tobacco taxes are lower in France than in Britain. Economically, it makes sense for people to buy their supplies of wine, beer, spirits, and tobacco in bulk in France instead of Britain.  There is keen competition between [[List of ferry operators|ferry operators]] and the [[Channel Tunnel]] [[Eurotunnel Shuttle]]. The day fares to [[Calais]] are normally around £60 per vehicle, but are sometimes discounted to as little as £10 at off-peak times. Since beer often costs little more than half the English shop price, at worst, the savings defray the cost of a day out.

Serving this market has become big business around the major ferry ports of [[Calais]], [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], and [[Dunkirk]] in France, and [[Ostend]] in Belgium. Even longer routes from [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] generate business, boosted by ferries from Ireland where alcohol duties are even higher. The exit route from the Calais ferry port passes several large warehouse retailers (English-owned) that serve the market, and some large British supermarket chains have alcohol-only branches selling bottles identical to those in Britain, but at deep discounts. The French have opened an enormous shopping precinct adjacent to the Channel Tunnel ([[Cité Europe]]) that attracts large numbers of British shoppers.

Following large increases in tobacco duty in France, it is now very common for smokers to make a detour to the small town of [[Adinkerke]] just over the border in [[Belgium]], where tobacco duty is lower.  Many people intending to purchase mainly tobacco products opt for the revitalised service from Dover to Dunkirk, as Dunkirk is much closer to the Belgian border than Calais, and the ferries on this route are slightly more 'smoker-friendly'.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Some buying both tobacco and alcohol make a triangular journey (Dover - Dunkirk - Calais - Dover or vice versa).

It is important to differentiate between booze cruisers (who purchase and transport goods legally) and professional [[smugglers]], who often have criminal motives. Genuine booze cruisers are often people 'on a budget', who simply opt to purchase their own personal supplies from 'Shop A' (in France or Belgium) at lower prices than offered at 'Shop B' (in Britain). Booze cruisers normally travel as a family or group of friends, and often take the opportunity to generally have a 'day out' in France and indulge in recreational 'channel shopping' for French produce and unfamiliar foods, clothing and other goods while they are there.  In addition to alcohol and tobacco, many other items, including mundane household items such as washing powder and cooking oil are much cheaper in France than the UK.

The cost of getting to France fluctuates due to season and fuel surcharges, but fares for foot passengers remain low. Calais in particular is very well-served by public transport, with the ferry companies also providing a shuttle bus from the ferry terminal to the town centre and (by request) the bus interchange at the SNCF railway station.

French tobacco duties have also risen, reducing further the economic advantage of a "booze cruise". Unless one is close to the Channel ports, it's unlikely to be financially beneficial. The motivation is changing, therefore, from purely economic to leisure and variety of choice.

Originally alcohol purchases on board the ferry had the additional attraction of being duty-free, adding a secondary meaning to booze cruise.

==Economic impacts==
The current situation benefits individuals living near to the English south coast who retain an economic advantage by shopping in France. It benefits the entrepreneurs who have businesses around the French ports dependent upon bulk purchases and also other local businesses that benefit from passing trade. The Calais area suffers high unemployment (around 20%) and benefits from the service jobs created by the influx of English [[day-tripper]]s. The ferry and tunnel operators also benefit from the extra traffic, in a situation that might otherwise be over-supplied.

On the downside, UK taxes (especially on tobacco) seem to have risen beyond the point of diminishing returns, so the British Exchequer loses substantial revenue that might otherwise have been collected to the economies of France and Belgium.{{Citation needed|reason=Need source, also possible peacock word with the "substantial"|date=June 2012}} Shops (particularly in the English South-East) also report that their trade suffers because taxes make their prices uncompetitive with both legal and illegal imports.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

== French law limiting the transport of tobacco ==

A recent French law has effectively outlawed tobacco tourism which uses France either as a destination or as a route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.day-tripper.net/xzi/xphotoaccessfrenchdouanes.gif |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714013944/http://www.day-tripper.net/xzi/xphotoaccessfrenchdouanes.gif |archivedate=2009-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure from the tobacco sellers interest group, les bureaux de tabac, and despite the resistance of the French government, the French Parliament has enacted a law that makes it illegal to transport more than 200 cigarettes whilst in French territory:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article583712.ece French tobacco law]&lt;/ref&gt; fines and confiscation are sanctions if a person is found to be in possession of more than 200 cigarettes whilst traveling through/in France. The law is designed to prevent French citizens buying tobacco in Belgium and Luxembourg.

Following recent tax increases in France it has become more attractive for French citizens to buy tobacco in Belgium and Luxembourg. The law also applies to citizens of other European countries traveling through France with more than 200 cigarettes in their possession. There is a suggestion that the law is incompatible with European Commission directives which demand freedom of movement and goods, for personal use, across the borders of European Union countries excluding specifically named "new member states".

== Legal issues and UK Customs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/jun/28/shopping.money &lt;!-- old URL: http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1807926,00.html --&gt; |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=June 28, 2006 |title=Europe drops 'booze cruise' battle with Britain |author=Press Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

EU Directive 92/12 Article 8 states:  ''"As regards products acquired by private individuals for their own use and transported by them... excise duty shall be charged in the member state in which they are acquired".''

In answer to a legal challenge; a European Court of Justice ruling on 23 November 2006 surprisingly overturned their own Advocate-General's advice and reconfirmed that: ''"only products acquired and transported personally by private individuals are exempt from excise duty in the member state of importation".''

This ruling effectively thwarted the hoped-for option of ordering goods (particularly tobacco), via Internet, from low duty states in the European Union and having them posted to a United Kingdom address, causing discussion in the British media about how a supposed 'Free Trade Area' seems to work for the benefit of some but not others.

The current position is: people may personally ''bring'' into Britain ''with them'' unlimited amounts of alcohol and/or tobacco from another EU member state, provided that they have been legally purchased (with the relevant local rate of duty paid) in the member state of origin, and are for either personal consumption, or as a genuine gift to another.  Importing goods for resale at a profit, or even 'not for profit' proxy purchases on behalf of non-travelling third parties is not permitted.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Although fully aware of this, [[HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC), faced with widespread abuse by smugglers, impose 'guidelines' - limits based on what they are prepared to believe are reasonable amounts for personal consumption (nominally six months' supply). Most travellers are unaffected, but there are instances of infrequent trippers forward-buying large supplies of (for example) their favourite brand of cigarette, and falling foul of the 'limits' intended to deal with professional smugglers.

HMRC have the legal right to stop and search any vehicle.  As their main duty is to detect 'smuggled' goods (and other far more sinister imports), they can (and usually do) use their own common sense regarding unconcealed (i.e. openly carried) goods above their 'limits', if they are happy that the goods are genuinely for personal consumption.  Generally, suspicion will only be aroused if the goods start to look less like a 'personal' hoard, and more like a commercial operation.  For example: importing more different brands of tobacco products than there are adult travellers in the vehicle arouses particular suspicion, as most smokers tend to remain loyal to one particular brand. However, there have been reported cases of more extreme treatment (especially where people have unnecessarily concealed extra goods in vehicle cavities, spare wheel wells etc.), with family cars and contents being confiscated on the spot and the travelers left stranded at Dover in the dead of night. This has led to legal challenges to the powers of HMRC, citing the heavy-handedness and inconsistency of some actions, and their dubious legality under European law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jan/20/travelnews.travel &lt;!-- old URL: http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1690719,00.html --&gt; |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 20, 2006 |title=Customs pays out £2m to settle booze cruise claim |first=Miles |last=Brignall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation on the standard booze cruise was the ill-fated [[offshore off-licence]] which operated briefly off Hartlepool in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/3900181.stm |title=Offshore off-licence will reopen |date=16 July 2004 |work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hidden away in the rural [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]], Casa Susanna provided much-needed privacy to its guests in a time when being publicly transgender was a criminal offense. However, guests occasionally visited the town of Hunter to shop, where they were met by a range of reactions. Some were negative, but many locals saw them as reliable customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chronogram.com/hudsonvalley/queens-of-the-catskills/Content?oid=2172129|title=Queens of the Catskills|last=Blotcher|first=Jay|website=Chronogram Magazine|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casa Susanna was a haven for its guests to go to and celebrate their "inner girl" without persecution. There, they could be happy and comfortable, participating in activities like gardening and [[Scrabble]] in elegant 1950s-style heels and dresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3393976/casa-susanna-photographs-from-a-1950s-transvestite-hideaway/|title=Casa Susanna: Photographs From a 1950s Transvestite Hideaway|last=TIME|website=Time|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most guests at Casa Susanna were married and considered themselves heterosexual men who enjoyed cross-dressing, but many others later identified as transgender and lived out their lives as women, including [[Virginia Prince]] and Susanna herself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Photography for transvestites in the 1950s was both affirming and extremely dangerous. Sending negatives to a professional developer who might call the police was out of the question, so Casa Susanna appointed an official photographer from one of its own: Andrea Susan. Andrea took many photographs of her fellow guests and developed them at home.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dallasdenny.com/Chrysalis/2014/05/10/the-historical-roots-of-casa-valentina/|title=The Historical Roots of Casa Valentina {{!}} Chrysalis Quarterly|website=dallasdenny.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Polaroids were popular for their instantaneous development, Andrea's photography was of higher quality, and she could be trusted. She put the negatives in the possession of her mentor Dick, who had gifted her her photo development equipment. When Dick threw them away, they made their way to a Manhattan flea market in the mid-2000s. There, they were found by Robert Swope,&lt;ref&gt;Not the Robert Swope of [[The Vagina Monologues#Robert Swope critique|Vagina Monologues]] fame.&lt;/ref&gt; “a gentle punk rocker turned furniture dealer,” who bought every photograph he could find and published them into a book with his partner Michel Hurst.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The release of this book fifty years later led many former attendees of Casa Susanna to come forward and share their experiences, allowing the resort to be documented. Without this chance encounter, Casa Susanna may have been lost to history.

Casa Susanna also inspired the [[Tony Award|Tony]]-nominated play [[Casa Valentina]] by [[Harvey Fierstein]].

== Etymology ==
Greek {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:χάος|χάος]]}} means "[[emptiness]], vast void, [[chasm]],&lt;ref&gt;West, p. 192 line 116 '''Χάος''', "best translated Chasm"; English ''chasm'' is a loan from Greek [[wiktionary:χάσμα|χάσμα]], which is root-cognate with χάος.
Most, p. 13, translates ''Χάος'' as "Chasm", and notes: (n. 7): "Usually translated as 'Chaos'; but that suggests to us, misleadingly, a jumble of disordered matter, whereas Hesiod's term indicates instead a gap or opening".&lt;/ref&gt; [[abyss (religion)|abyss]]", from the verb {{lang|grc|[[wikt:χαίνω|χαίνω]]}}, "gape, be wide open, etc.", from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*ǵ&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;eh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;n-}}'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, pp. 1614 and 1616–7.&lt;/ref&gt; cognate to [[Old English language|Old English]] ''geanian'', "to gape", whence English ''[[:wikt:yawn|yawn]]''.&lt;ref name="OnEtD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chaos&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=chaos|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It may also mean space, the expanse of air, and the nether abyss, infinite [[darkness]].&lt;ref name="chaos"&gt;Lidell-Scott, ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxa%2Fos1 chaos]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pherecydes of Syros]] (fl. 6th century BC) interprets ''chaos'' as water, like something formless which can be differentiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kirk|Raven|Schofield|2003|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greco-Roman tradition==
[[Hesiod]] and the [[Pre-Socratic]]s use the Greek term in the context of [[cosmogony]]. Hesiod's ''chaos'' has been interpreted as either
"the gaping void above the Earth created when Earth and Sky are separated from their primordial unity" or "the gaping space below the Earth on which Earth rests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.artsci.lsu.edu/voegelin/EVS/Panel42001.htm| title = Hesiod as Precursor to the Presocratic Philosophers: A Voeglinian View| accessdate = 2008-12-04| author = Richard F.

In Hesiod, Chaos was the first thing to exist: "at first Chaos came to be" (or was)&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 3, says "the Greek will allow both".&lt;/ref&gt; "but next" (possibly out of Chaos) came [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Tartarus]], and [[Eros]] (elsewhere the son of [[Aphrodite]]).&lt;ref&gt;According to Gantz, p. 4: "With regard to all three of these figures&amp;mdash;Gaia, Tartaros, and Eros&amp;mdash;we should note that Hesiod does not say they arose ''from'' (as opposed to ''after'') Chaos, although this is often assumed." For example, Morford, p. 57, makes these three descendants of Chaos saying they came "presumably out of Chaos, just as Hesiod actually states that 'from Chaos' came Erebus and dark Night". Tripp, p. 159, says simply that Gaia, Tartarus and Eros came "out of Chaos, or together with it". Caldwell, p. 33 n. 116&amp;ndash;122, however interprets Hesiod as saying that Chaos, Gaia, Tartarus, and Eros all "are spontaneously generated without source or cause". Later writers commonly make Eros the son of [[Aphrodite]] and [[Ares]], though several other parentages are also given, Gantz, pp. 4&amp;ndash;5.&lt;/ref&gt; Unambiguously born "from Chaos" were [[Erebus]] (Darkness) and [[Nyx]] (Night).&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 4; Hesiod. ''Theogony, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+123 123].''&lt;/ref&gt; For Hesiod, Chaos, like Tartarus, though personified enough to have borne children, was also a place, far away, underground and "gloomy", beyond which lived the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+814 814]'': "And beyond, away from all the gods, live the Titans, beyond gloomy Chaos".&lt;/ref&gt; And, like the earth, the ocean, and the upper air, it was also capable of being affected by Zeus' thunderbolts.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+700 700]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Passages in Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]'' suggest that Chaos was located below Earth but above Tartarus.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 3; Hesiod. ''Theogony, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+813 813&amp;#x2013;814]'', ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+700 700]''; ''cf.'' ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+740 740]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Primal Chaos was sometimes said to be the true foundation of reality, particularly by philosophers such as [[Heraclitus]].

The notion of the temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality.{{huh|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref name=Guthrie59/&gt; This idea of the divine as an origin{{huh|date=March 2018}} influenced the first Greek philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;W. Jaeger (1953). ''The Theology of the early Greek philosophers. The Gifford lectures'' p.33:Nilsson, Vol I, p.743&lt;/ref&gt; The main object of the first efforts to explain the world remained the description of its growth, from a beginning. They believed that the world arose out from a primal unity, and that this substance was the permanent base of all its being. [[Anaximander]] claims that the origin is ''apeiron'' (the unlimited), a divine and perpetual substance less definite than the common elements. Everything is generated from ''apeiron'', and must return there according to necessity.&lt;ref&gt;W. K. Guthrie (1952): ''The Presocratic World-picture'' p.87: Nilsson, Vol I, p.743&lt;/ref&gt; A conception of the nature of the world was that the earth below its surface stretches down indefinitely and has its roots on or above [[Tartarus]], the lower part of the underworld.&lt;ref name=Kirk9&gt;{{Harvnb|Kirk|Raven|Schofield|2003|pp=9, 10, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a phrase of [[Xenophanes]], "The upper limit of the earth borders on air, near our feet. The lower limit reaches down to the "apeiron" (i.e. the unlimited)."&lt;ref name=Kirk9/&gt; The sources and limits of the earth, the sea, the sky, [[Tartarus]], and all things are located in a great windy-gap, which seems to be infinite, and is a later specification of "chaos".&lt;ref name=Kirk9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:729-766 740-765]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Aristophanes]]'s comedy ''[[The Birds (play)|Birds]]'', first there was Chaos, Night, Erebus, and Tartarus, from Night came Eros, and from Eros and Chaos came the race of birds.&lt;ref&gt; [[Aristophanes|Aristophane]]. ''[[The Birds (play)|Birds]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0019.tlg006.perseus-eng1:685-707 693&amp;#x2013;699]; Morford, pp 57&amp;#x2013;58. Caldwell, p. 2, describes this avian theogony as "comedic parody".&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|At the beginning there was only Chaos, Night, dark Erebus, and deep Tartarus. Earth, the air and heaven had no existence. Firstly, blackwinged Night laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Erebus, and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in deep Tartarus with dark Chaos, winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race, which was the first to see the light. That of the Immortals did not exist until Eros had brought together all the ingredients of the world, and from their marriage Heaven, Ocean, Earth and the imperishable race of blessed gods sprang into being. Thus our origin is very much older than that of the dwellers in Olympus. We [birds] are the offspring of Eros; there are a thousand proofs to show it. We have wings and we lend assistance to lovers. How many handsome youths, who had sworn to remain insensible, have opened their thighs because of our power and have yielded themselves to their lovers when almost at the end of their youth, being led away by the gift of a quail, a waterfowl, a goose, or a cock.}}

For Ovid, (1st century BC), in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', Chaos was an unformed mass, where all the elements were jumbled up together in a "shapeless heap".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]].

According to [[Hyginus]]: "From Mist (''Caligine'') came Chaos. From Chaos and Mist, came Night (''Nox''), Day (''Dies''), Darkness (''Erebus''), and Ether (''Aether'')."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]. ''[[Fabulae]],'' ''[https://topostext.org/work/206 Preface],'' translated by Smith and Trzaskoma, p. 95. According to Bremmer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YTfxZH4QnqgC&amp;pg=PA5 p. 5], who translates ''Caligine'' as "Darkness": "Hyginus ... started his ''Fabulae'' with a strange hodgepodge of Greek and Roman cosmogonies and early genealogies. It begins as follows: ''Ex Caligine Chaos. Ex Chao et Caligine Nox Dies Erebus Aether'' (Praefatio 1). His genealogy looks like a derivation from Hesiod, but it starts with the un-Hesiodic and un-Roman ''Caligo'', ‘Darkness’. Darkness probably did occur in a cosmogonic poem of Alcman, but it seems only fair to say that it was not prominent in Greek cosmogonies."&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic tradition]] apparently had Chaos as the son of [[Chronus]] and [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]].&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, pp. 36&amp;ndash;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifth-century [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] cosmogony had a "Womb of Darkness" in which the Wind lay a ''[[world egg|Cosmic Egg]]'' whence [[Eros]] was hatched, who set the universe [[Unmoved mover|in motion]].{{fact|date=March 2018}}

==''Chaoskampf''==
[[File:Michael4.jpg|150px|thumb|Depiction of the Christianized ''Chaoskampf'': statue of [[Archangel Michael]] slaying a dragon. The inscription on the shield reads: ''[[Quis ut Deus?]]'']]
{{Further|Dragon|Lotan|Leviathan|Sea serpent|Proto-Indo-European religion#Dragon or Serpent|Yamata no Orochi#Mythological parallels}}
The motif of ''Chaoskampf'' ({{IPA-de|ˈkaːɔsˌkampf|lang}}, "struggle against chaos") is ubiquitous in myth and legend, depicting a battle of a [[culture hero]] deity with a ''chaos monster'', often in the shape of a serpent or [[dragon]]. The same term has also been extended to parallel concepts in the Middle East and North Africa, such as the abstract conflict of ideas in the Egyptian duality of [[Maat]] and [[Isfet (Egyptian mythology)|Isfet]] or the battle of [[Horus]] and [[Set (deity)|Set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=Yz6vAwAAQBAJ&amp;|title=Space and Time in the Religious Life of the Near East|last=Wyatt|first=Nicolas|date=2001-12-01|publisher=A&amp;C Black|year=|isbn=9780567049421|location=|pages=210-211|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the ''Chaoskampf'' myth most likely lie in the [[Proto-Indo-European religion]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} whose descendants almost all feature some variation of the story of a [[storm god]] fighting a [[sea serpent]] representing the clash between the forces of order and chaos. Early work by German academics such as [[Hermann Gunkel|Gunkel]] and [[Wilhelm Bousset|Bousset]] in [[comparative mythology]] popularized translating the mythological sea serpent as a "[[dragon]]." Indo-European examples of this mythic trope include [[Thor]] vs. [[Jörmungandr]] ([[Norse mythology|Norse]]), [[Tarḫunz]] vs. [[Illuyanka]] ([[Hittite mythology|Hittite]]), [[Indra]] vs. [[Vritra]] ([[Vedic mythology|Vedic]]), [[Fereydun|Θraētaona]] vs. [[Zahhak|Aži Dahāka]] ([[Avestan]]) and [[Zeus]] vs. [[Typhon]] ([[Greek mythology|Greek]]) among others. Non-Indo-European examples of this trope are [[Marduk]] vs. [[Tiamat]], [[Yahweh]] vs. [[Leviathan]] ([[Hebrew]]), [[Susano'o]] vs. [[Yamata no Orochi]] ([[Japanese mythology|Japanese]]) and [[Mwindo]] vs. [[Kirimu]] ([[African mythology|African]]).&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Calvert (1995).

==Biblical tradition==
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Chaos (State 1).jpg|thumb|''Chaos'' by [[Wenceslaus Hollar]] (1607&amp;ndash;1677).]]
''Chaos'' has been linked with the term ''[[abyss (religion)|abyss]]''/''[[tohu wa-bohu]]'' of [[Genesis 1:2]]. The term may refer to a state of non-being prior to creation&lt;ref&gt;Tsumura, D., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qevX11bQRi8C&amp;pg=PA9 Creation and Destruction. A Reappraisal of the Chaoskampf Theory in the Old Testament]'', Winona Lake/IN, 1989, 2nd ed. 2005, {{ISBN|978-1-57506-106-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Westermann, ''Genesis, Kapitel 1-11'', (BKAT I/1), Neukirchen-Vluyn, 1974, 3rd ed. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; or to a formless state. In the [[Book of Genesis]], the spirit of God is moving upon the face of the waters, displacing the earlier state of the universe which is likened to a "watery chaos" upon which there is ''choshek'' (which translated from the Hebrew is darkness/confusion).&lt;ref name=Guthrie59&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg|isbn=9780521294201|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103123340/http://books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg|archivedate=2014-01-03|df=}} pp. 59, 60, 83 {{ISBN|0-521-29420-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Genesis 1:2, English translation ([[New International Version]])''(2011): [http://www.biblegateway.com BibleGateway.com] Biblica incorporation&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Septuagint]] makes no use of {{lang|grc|χάος}} in the context of creation, instead using the term for {{lang|he| גיא}}, "cleft, gorge, chasm", in [[Book of Micah|Micah]] 1:6 and [[Book of Zechariah|Zacharia]] 14:4.&lt;ref&gt;''Strong's Concordance'' [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H1516&amp;t=KJV H1516].&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Vulgate]], however, renders the χάσμα μέγα or "great gulf" between [[heaven]] and [[hell]] in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 16:26 as ''chaos magnum''.

This model of a primordial state of matter has been opposed by the [[Church Fathers]] from the 2nd century, who posited a creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' by an omnipotent [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard May, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=s6nao1QMXscC&amp;pg=PA151 Schöpfung aus dem Nichts. Die Entstehung der Lehre von der creatio ex nihilo]'', AKG 48, Berlin / New York, 1978, 151f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[biblical studies]], the term ''chaos'' is commonly used in the context of the [[Torah]] and their cognate narratives in Ancient Near Eastern mythology more generally. Parallels between the Hebrew Genesis and the Babylonian [[Enuma Elish]] were established by [[Hermann Gunkel]] in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;H. Gunkel, ''Genesis'', HKAT I.1, Göttingen, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides Genesis, other books of the Old Testament, especially a number of [[Psalms]], some passages in [[Isaiah]] and [[Jeremiah]] and the [[Book of Job]] are relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Michaela Bauks, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080507084109/http://www.bibelwissenschaft.de/wibilex/das-bibellexikon/details/quelle/WIBI/zeichen/c/referenz/15897/cache/9d97442e21/ Chaos / Chaoskampf], WiBiLex – Das Bibellexikon (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michaela Bauks, ''Die Welt am Anfang.

==Alchemy and Hermeticism==
{{Further|Prima materia}}
[[File:Lotto Capoferri Magnum Chaos.jpg|thumb|''Magnum Chaos'', wood-inlay by [[Giovan Francesco Capoferri]] at the [[Santa Maria Maggiore, Bergamo|Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] in [[Bergamo]], based on a design by [[Lorenzo Lotto]].]]
The Greco-Roman tradition of ''Prima Materia'', notably including the 5th and 6th century Orphic cosmogony, was merged with biblical notions (''[[Tehom]]'') in [[Christianity]] and inherited by [[alchemy]] and [[Renaissance magic]].

The cosmic egg of Orphism was taken as the raw material for the alchemical [[magnum opus (alchemy)|magnum opus]] in early Greek alchemy. The first stage of the process of producing the [[philosopher's stone]], i.e., [[nigredo]], was identified with chaos. Because of association with the [[Genesis creation narrative]], where "the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters" (Gen. 1:2), Chaos was further identified with the [[classical element]] of [[Water (classical element)|Water]].

[[Ramon Llull]] (1232–1315) wrote a ''Liber Chaos'', in which he identifies Chaos as the primal form or matter created by God.
Swiss alchemist [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541) uses ''chaos'' synonymously with "classical element" (because the primeval chaos is imagined as a formless congestion of all elements). Paracelsus thus identifies [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]] as "the chaos of the ''gnomi''", i.e., the element of the [[gnome]]s, through which these spirits move unobstructed as fish do through water, or birds through air.&lt;ref&gt;De Nymphis etc. Wks. 1658 II. 391&lt;/ref&gt;
An alchemical treatise by [[Heinrich Khunrath]], printed in Frankfurt in 1708, was entitled ''Chaos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khunrath|first=Heinrich|authorlink=Heinrich Khunrath|title=Vom Hylealischen, das ist Pri-materialischen Catholischen oder Allgemeinen Natürlichen Chaos der naturgemässen Alchymiae und Alchymisten: Confessio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X1g6AAAAcAAJ|year=1708}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1708 introduction to the treatise states that the treatise was written in 1597 in Magdeburg, in the author's 23rd year of practicing alchemy.&lt;ref&gt;Urszula Szulakowska, ''The alchemy of light: geometry and optics in late Renaissance alchemical illustration'', vol. 10 of Symbola et Emblemata - Studies in Renaissance and Baroque Symbolism, BRILL, 2000, {{ISBN|978-90-04-11690-0}}, ch. 7 (pp. 79ff).&lt;/ref&gt; The treatise purports to quote Paracelsus on the point that "The light of the soul, by the will of the Triune God, made all earthly things appear from the primal Chaos."&lt;ref&gt;Szulakowska (2000), p. 91, quoting ''Chaos'' p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Martin Ruland the Younger]], in his 1612 ''Lexicon Alchemiae'', states, "A crude mixture of matter or another name for ''Materia Prima'' is ''Chaos'', as it is in the Beginning."

The term ''[[gas]]'' in [[chemistry]] was coined by Dutch chemist [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] in the 17th century directly based on the Paracelsian notion of chaos. The ''g'' in ''gas'' is due to the Dutch pronunciation of this letter as a spirant, also employed to pronounce Greek [[chi (letter)|χ]].&lt;ref&gt;"halitum illum Gas vocavi, non longe a Chao veterum secretum." Ortus Medicinæ, ed. 1652, p. 59a, cited after the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==

The term ''[[:wikt:chaos|chaos]]'' has been adopted in modern [[comparative mythology]] and [[religious studies]] as referring to the primordial state before creation, strictly combining two separate notions of primordial waters or a primordial darkness from which a new order emerges and a primordial state as a merging of opposites, such as heaven and earth, which must be separated by a creator deity in an act of cosmogony.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Eliade]], article "Chaos" in ''Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3rd ed. vol. 1, Tübingen, 1957, 1640f.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, chaos referring to a notion of a primordial state contains the cosmos ''in potentia'' but needs to be formed by a [[demiurge]] before the world can begin its existence.

Use of ''chaos'' in the derived sense of "complete disorder or confusion" first appears in Elizabethan [[Early Modern English]], originally implying satirical exaggeration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Gosson]], ''The schoole of abuse, containing a plesaunt inuectiue against poets, pipers, plaiers, iesters and such like caterpillers of a commonwelth'' (1579), p. 53 (cited after [[OED]]): "They make their volumes no better than [...] a huge Chaos of foule disorder."&lt;/ref&gt;
"[[Chaos theory|Chaos]]" in the well-defined sense of [[chaotic complex system]] is in turn derived from this usage.

"[[Chaos magic]]" as a branch of contemporary [[occultism]] is a product of the 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1774">'''Collège philosophique''' was an association founded in 1946 by [[Jean Wahl]], located in the [[Latin Quarter]] in Paris.

Wahl created it because he felt the lack of an alternative to the [[Sorbonne]] (University of Paris), where it would be possible to give voice to non-academic discourses; it became the place where non-conformist intellectuals — and those believing themselves to be so—- were tolerated and given consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emmanuel Levinas]] (1982). ''Éthique et infini'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

It 1974, after Wahl's death, it inspired the foundation of the [[:fr:Collège de philosophie|Collège de philosophie]].

==Notable conferences==
On March 4, 1963, it hosted the conference from which originated the rift between [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Michel Foucault]]. Derrida gave the lecture ''Cogito and the History of Madness'',&lt;ref&gt;''Cogito and the History of Madness'' collected in Derrida [1967] ''[[Writing and Difference]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; a critique of Foucault, that possibly also prompted Foucault to write his works ''[[The Order of Things]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'' (1969).&lt;ref name="GinzburgNihilism"&gt;[[Carlo Ginzburg]] [1976], ''Il formaggio e i vermi'', translated in 1980 as ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4IUREWq_o3MC The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller]'', trans.

==Examples==
Unidentified flying objects have long been reported through history, but the claimed craft are always a perversion of the technology or fiction of the day, and "the UFO 
technology tracks what our culture has but rarely 
exceeds it by a great deal."&lt;ref name="randles"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/Volume2.MindControlpdf/84969909-Jenny-Randles-Alien-Contact-The-First-Fifty-Years_djvu.txt| first1=Jenny| last1=Randles| first2=| last2=| title=Alien Contact: The First Fifty Years| page=| publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; When aviation was limited to [[hot-air balloons]], UFO reports consisted of claims of mysterious [[airships]].&lt;ref name="rutkowski"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AXo7AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1956#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first1=Chris A.|last1=Rutkowski| first2=| last2=| title=Abductions and Aliens: What's Really Going On| page=| publisher=Dundurn|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reported in the 1890s, these airships were distinguished from our technology by their giant size, but they nevertheless needed propellers.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt; The later [[flying saucers]] were also a weird version of then-current aerospace technology; as John Spencer notes in ''The UFO Encyclopedia'': "Witnesses aboard flying saucers have reported, for example, chunky number counters on the saucer control panels, but we did not have reports of liquid quartz readouts until we ourselves invented them."&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;

Reports also track the [[science fiction]] prevalent at the time. Claims of UFOs stopping car engines and lights did not appear until a similar effect featured in the 1951 film ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]''.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2O0QDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70| first1=Andrew| last1=May| first2=| last2=| title=Pseudoscience and Science Fiction|page=|publisher=Springer|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' had the effect of standardizing accounts of [[grey aliens]] with entirely black eyes, though these were the invention of the film's special effects man, [[Carlo Rambaldi]].&lt;ref name="may"/&gt; Note: This is actually not true. Spielberg utilized J. Allen Hynek and resorts from abductees from the time to inform Rambaldi's design.

==Explanations==
Cultural tracking appears to discredit a simple [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]] (ETH) as an explanation of UFOs. The [[psychosocial hypothesis]] (PSH) rejects the idea that UFOs are alien craft, and posits the [[Occam's Razor|simplest explanation]]: the UFOs and their occupants are imaginary. However, some believers in alien visitation embraced the idea of cultural tracking, claiming that advanced "ultraterrestrials" are capable of deliberately changing how they appear to humans. Advocates of this "[[interdimensional hypothesis]]" (IDH) believe that these beings might sometimes present themselves in the manner of 1950s sci-fi, but they could also appear as [[fairies]], [[angels]], [[ghosts]] or any other supernatural beings. However, they may disagree as to the aliens' motives for doing this. [[Jacques Vallee]] in the book ''Passport to Magonia'', and [[John Keel]], in his 1970 book ''Operation Trojan Horse'', are sometimes seen as the instigators of this trend.&lt;ref name="disinfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disinfo.com/2014/02/explanations-ufos/|title=Explanations For UFOs (excerpt from '"UFO Investigations Manual: UFO investigations from 1982 to the present day", courtesy of Haynes Publishing)|author=Nigel Watson|website=disinfo.com|date=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diocletian's Palace''' ({{lang-hr|Dioklecijanova palača}}, {{IPA-sh|diɔklɛt͡sijǎːnɔʋa pǎlat͡ʃa|pron}}) is an ancient palace built for the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] at the turn of the fourth century AD, that today forms about half the old town of [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Croatia]]. While it is referred to as a "palace" because of its intended use as the retirement residence of Diocletian, the term can be misleading as the structure is massive and more resembles a large fortress: about half of it was for Diocletian's personal use, and the rest housed the military garrison.

Diocletian built the massive palace in preparation for his retirement on 1 May 305 AD. It lies in a bay on the south side of a short peninsula running out from the Dalmatian coast, four miles from [[Salona]], the capital of the [[Roman province of Dalmatia]]. The terrain slopes gently seaward and is typical [[karst]], consisting of low [[limestone]] ridges running east to west with [[marl]] in the clefts between them.

==History==

}}

After the Romans abandoned the site, the Palace remained empty for several centuries.  In the 7th century, nearby residents fled to the walled palace in an effort to escape invading [[Croats]]. Since then the palace has been occupied, with residents making their homes and businesses within the palace basement and directly in its walls.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.croatiatraveller.com/Heritage_Sites/Diocletian'sPalace.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Today many restaurants and shops, and some homes, can still be found within the walls.

After the [[Middle Ages]] the palace was virtually unknown in the rest of Europe until the Scottish [[neo-classical architect]] [[Robert Adam]] had the ruins surveyed and, with the aid of French artist and antiquary [[Charles-Louis Clérisseau]] and several draughtsmen, published ''Ruins of the Palace of the Emperor Diocletian at Spalatro in Dalmatia'' (London, 1764).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/RuinspalaceEmpe00Adam Archive.org], =[http://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/ruinspalaceempe00adam Smithsonian], [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?id=DLDecArts.AdamRuins University of Wisconsin]&lt;/ref&gt;

Diocletian's palace was an inspiration for Adam's new style of [[Neoclassical architecture]]&lt;ref name="CMHogan"&gt;Hogan, C. Michael,  [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17691  "Diocletian's Palace"], The Megalithic Portal, A. Burnham ed., 6 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and the publication of measured drawings brought it into the design vocabulary of European architecture for the first time. A few decades later, in 1782, the French painter [[Louis-François Cassas]] created drawings of the palace, published by [[Joseph Lavallée]] in 1802 in the chronicles of his voyages.&lt;ref&gt;''Voyage pittoresque et historique de l'Istrie et de la Dalmatie rédigé d'après l'Itinéraire de L. F. Cassas par Joseph Lavallée'' (Paris, 1802).&lt;/ref&gt;

This palace is today, with all the most important historical buildings, in the centre of the city of Split. Diocletian's Palace far transcends local importance because of its degree of preservation. The Palace is one of the most famous and complete architectural and cultural features on the Croatian [[Adriatic]] coast. As the world's most complete remains of a Roman palace, it holds an outstanding place in [[Mediterranean]], European and world heritage.

==Cultural heritage==
[[File:Peristyle of Diocletian's Palace in Split, Robert Adam, 1764 (cropped).jpg|thumb|View of the Peristyle in 1764, engraving by [[Robert Adam]]. The Peristyle is the central square of the palace, where the main entrance to Diocletian's quarters (pictured) is located.]]

In November 1979 [[UNESCO]], in line with the international convention on cultural and natural heritage, adopted a proposal that the historic city of Split built around the Palace should be included in the register of [[World Cultural Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://w3.mrki.info/split/diokl.html Diocletian Palace]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006 the City Council decided to permit over twenty new buildings within the palace (including a shopping and garage complex), although the palace had been declared a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Monument. It is said that this decision was politically motivated and largely due to lobbying by local property developers. Once the public in 2007 became aware of the project, they petitioned against the decision and won. No new buildings, shopping center or the underground garage was built.

The [[World Monuments Fund]] has been working on a conservation project at the palace, including surveying structural integrity and cleaning and restoring the stone and plasterwork.

The palace is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Croatian 500 [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] banknote, issued in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/enovcan.htm?tsfsg=5caabbb4dca58151e125c650d3cdae36 Features of Kuna Banknotes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506012028/http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/enovcan.htm?tsfsg=5caabbb4dca58151e125c650d3cdae36 |date=6 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/novcanice/e500k.htm?tsfsg=a649438eb16231e47533d70f5e0ed4c4 500 kuna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604014206/http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/novcanice/e500k.htm?tsfsg=a649438eb16231e47533d70f5e0ed4c4 |date=4 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

The ground plan of the palace is an irregular rectangle (approximately 160 meters x 190 meters) with towers projecting from the western, northern, and eastern facades. It combines qualities of a luxurious [[villa]] with those of a military camp, with its huge gates and watchtowers. The palace is enclosed by walls, and at times, it housed over 9000 people.  Subterranean portions of the palace feature [[barrel vault]]ed stonework.

Only the southern facade, which rose directly from or very near to the sea, was unfortified. The elaborate architectural composition of the arcaded gallery on its upper floor differs from the more severe treatment of the three shore facades. A monumental gate in the middle of each of these walls led to an enclosed courtyard. The southern sea gate (the ''Porta Aenea'') was simpler in shape and dimensions than the other three, and it is thought that it was originally intended either as the emperor's private access to the sea, or as a service entrance for supplies.

}}
The design is derived from both villa and castrum types, and this duality is also evident in the arrangement of the interior. The transverse road ([[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]]) linking the eastern gate (the Silver Gate or ''Porta argentea'') and western gate (the Iron Gate or ''Porta ferrea'') divided the complex into two-halves. In the southern half were the more luxurious structures; that is, the emperor's apartments, both public and private, and religious buildings. The emperor's apartments formed a block along the sea front and were situated above a substructure because the sloping terrain demanded significant differences in level. Although for many centuries almost completely filled with refuse, most of the substructure is well preserved, and indicates the original shape and disposition of the rooms above.

A monumental court, called the [[Peristyle]], formed the northern access to the imperial apartments. It also gave access to Diocletian's mausoleum on the east (now [[Cathedral of St. Duje in Split|Cathedral of St. Domnius]]), and to three temples on the west (two of which are now lost, and the third became a baptistery, originally being the [[Temple of Jupiter, Split|temple of Jupiter]]). There is a temple just to the west of the Peristylum called The Temple of [[Aesculapius]], which has a semicylindrical roof, made out of hand carved stone blocks, which did not leak until the 1940s, and was then covered with a lead roof. The temple was restored recently.

The northern half of the palace, divided in two parts by the main north-south street (''[[cardo]]'') leading from the Golden Gate (''Porta aurea'') to the Peristyle, is less well preserved. It is usually supposed that each part was a residential complex, housing soldiers, servants, and possibly some other facilities. Both parts were apparently surrounded by streets. Leading to perimeter walls there were rectangular buildings, possibly storage magazines.

The Palace is built of white local limestone and [[marble]] of high quality, most of which was from Brač marble quarries on the island of [[Brač]], of [[tuff]] taken from the nearby river beds, and of brick made in [[Salona|Salonitan]] and other factories. Some material for decoration was imported: [[Egypt]]ian [[granite]] [[column]]s, fine marble for revetments and some capitals produced in workshops in the [[Proconnesos]]. The Palace was decorated with numerous 3500-year-old granite [[sphinx]]es, originating from the site of Egyptian Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]]. Only three have survived the centuries.

'''Disease mongering''' is a term for the practice of widening the diagnostic boundaries of illnesses and aggressively promoting their public awareness in order to expand the markets for treatment. 
Among the entities benefiting from selling and delivering treatments are [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]], physicians, [[alternative medicine|alternative practitioners]] and other professional or consumer organizations. It is distinct from the promulgation of [[List of questionable diseases|bogus or unrecognised diagnoses]].

==Term==
The term “[[Peddler#Types and names|monger]]” has ancient roots, providing the basis for many common compound forms such as cheesemonger, [[fishmonger]], and [[fleshmonger]] for those who peddle such wares respectively.  “Disease mongering” as a label for the "invention" or promotion of diseases in order to capitalize on their treatment was first used in 1992 by health writer Lynn Payer, who applied it to the [[Listerine]] mouthwash campaign against [[halitosis]] (bad breath).

Payer defined disease mongering as a set of practices which include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Payer|first=Lynn|title=Disease-mongers : how doctors, drug companies, and insurers are making you feel sick|year=1992|publisher=J. Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0471543855
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Stating that normal human experiences are abnormal and in need of treatment
* Claiming to recognize suffering which is not present
* Defining a disease such that a large number of people have it
* Defining a disease's cause as some ambiguous deficiency or [[hormonal imbalance]]
* Associating a disease with a public relations [[Spin (public relations)|spin]] campaign
* Directing the framing of public discussion of a disease
* Intentionally [[Misuse of statistics|misusing statistics]] to exaggerate treatment benefits
* Setting a dubious [[clinical endpoint]] in research
* Advertising a treatment as without [[side effect]]
* Advertising a common symptom as a serious disease

The incidence of conditions not previously defined as illness being [[medicalisation|medicalised]] as "diseases" is difficult to scientifically assess due to the inherent social and political nature of the definition of what constitutes a disease, and what aspects of the human condition should be managed according to a medical model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frosch DL, Grande D, Tarn DM, Kravitz RL |title=A decade of controversy: balancing policy with evidence in the regulation of prescription drug advertising |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=24–32 |date=January 2010  |pmid=19910354 |pmc=2791253 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2008.153767 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, halitosis, the condition which prompted Payer to coin the phrase "disease mongering", isn't merely an imagined social stigma but can stem from any of a wide spectrum of conditions spanning from bacterial infection of the gums to kidney failure, and is recognized by the Scientific Council of the American Dental Association as "a recognizable condition which deserves professional attention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nypediatricdds.com/Portals/0/Oral_Malodor_2012.pdf|title=nypediatricdds.com|format=|website=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018063249/http://nypediatricdds.com/Portals/0/Oral_Malodor_2012.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Australian journalist Ray Moynihan has argued that the pharmaceutical industry engages in disease mongering to enlarge its profits, and that it harms patients.&lt;ref name=Moynihan1&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moynihan R, Heath I, Henry D |title=Selling sickness: the pharmaceutical industry and disease mongering |journal=[[British Medical Journal|BMJ]] |volume=324 |issue=7342 |pages=886–91 |year=2002 |pmid=11950740 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/324/7342/886 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7342.886 |pmc=1122833}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His use of osteoporosis as an example of a "made up" disease in this article prompted an angry retort from the president of the British National Osteoporosis Society, stating that the article was insulting to people with osteoporosis and vastly understated the risk of disabling fractures associated with the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Edwards L |title=The pharmaceutical industry and disease mongering.

[[File:paulnabrone.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Poulnabrone dolmen]], [[the Burren]], [[County Clare]], Ireland.]]
[[File:Dolmens in Amadalavalasa.jpg|thumb|In [[Andhra Pradesh, India]], there is an evidence of dolmens existence in [[India|Indian]] Town of [[Amudalavalasa|Amadalavalasa]], Megalithic Dolmen (said to be world's large single capstone as a dolmen with 36 ft in length and 14 ft in width and 2 ft thickness) of early Iron Age at Dannanapeta near [[Amudalavalasa|Amadalavalasa]].]]

A '''dolmen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɒ|l|m|ɛ|n}}) or '''cromlech''' is a type of single-chamber [[Megalith#Tombs|megalithic tomb]], usually consisting of two or more vertical [[megalith]]s supporting a large flat horizontal capstone or "table". Most date from the early [[Neolithic]] (4000{{ndash}}3000 BC) and were sometimes covered with earth or smaller stones to form a [[tumulus]]. Small pad-stones may be wedged between the cap and supporting stones to achieve a level appearance.&lt;ref name="m43"&gt;Murphy (1997), 43&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances, the covering has weathered away, leaving only the stone "skeleton" of the mound intact.

It remains unclear when, why and by whom the earliest dolmens were made. The oldest known are found in Western Europe, dating from c 7,000 years ago. Archaeologists still do not know who erected these dolmens, which makes it difficult to know why they did it. They are generally all regarded as tombs or burial chambers, despite the absence of clear evidence for this. Human remains, sometimes accompanied by artefacts, have been found in or close to the dolmens which could be scientifically dated using [[radiocarbon dating]]. However, it has been impossible to prove that these remains date from the time when the stones were originally set in place.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, S. (2009) ''Guide to the Menhirs and other Megaliths of Central Brittany'', Nezert Books, {{ISBN|978-952-270-595-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''dolmen'' has an unclear history. The word entered archaeology when [[Théophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne]] used it to describe megalithic tombs in his ''Origines gauloises'' (1796) using the spelling ''dolmin'' (the current spelling was introduced about a decade later and had become standard in French by about 1885).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakker|first=Jan Albert|title=Megalithic Research in the Netherlands, 1547–1911|year=2009|publisher=Sidestone Press|isbn=978-9088900341 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne, {{google books|vmpAAAAAcAAJ|Origines gauloises. Celles des plus anciens peuples de l'Europe puisées dans leur vraie source ou recherche sur la langue, l'origine et les antiquités des Celto-bretons de l'Armorique, pour servir à l'histoire ancienne et moderne de ce peuple et à celle des Français|page=PR1}}, 1796–97.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' does not mention "dolmin" in English and gives its first citation for "dolmen" from a book on [[Brittany]] in 1859, describing the word as "The French term, used by some English authors, for a [[wikt:cromlech|cromlech]] ...".  The name was supposedly derived from a [[Breton language]] term meaning "stone table" but doubt has been cast on this, and the ''OED'' describes its origin as "Modern French". A book on [[Cornwall|Cornish]] antiquities from 1754 said that the current term in the [[Cornish language]] for a cromlech was ''tolmen'' ("hole of stone") and the OED says that "There is reason to think that this was the term inexactly reproduced by Latour d'Auvergne [sic] as ''dolmen'', and misapplied by him and succeeding French archaeologists to the ''cromlech''".&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'' "Dolmen", 1st edition, 1897&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless it has now replaced cromlech as the usual English term in archaeology, when the more technical and descriptive alternatives are not used.

Dolmens are known by a variety of names in other languages, including {{lang-ga|dolmain}}, [[Galician language|Galician]] and {{lang-pt|anta}}, {{lang-de|Hünengrab/Hünenbett}}, [[Afrikaans]] and {{lang-nl|hunebed}}, {{lang-eu|trikuharri}}, {{lang-ab|Adamra}}, [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] Ispun, ''dysse'' ([[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''dös'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), {{lang-ko|고인돌}} ''goindol (mordenized word: stacked stone)'', "dol (stone)", "dolmaengi (pebble-stones, varied stones)", and {{lang-he|גַלעֵד}}. [[:wikt:Granja|Granja]] is used in [[Portugal]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and [[Spain]]. The rarer forms ''anta'' and ''ganda'' also appear. In the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], they are attributed to the ''[[jentil]]ak'', a race of giants.

The [[etymology]] of the {{lang-de|Hünenbett, Hünengrab}} and {{lang-nl|hunebed}} - with ''Hüne/hune'' meaning "giant" - all evoke the image of [[Giant (mythology)|giants]] buried (bett/bed/grab = bed/grave)there. Of other [[Celtic languages]], {{lang-cy|cromlech}} was borrowed into English and ''quoit'' is commonly used in English in [[Cornwall]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6391">{{About|the psychology term|other uses|Father figure (disambiguation)}}
A '''father figure''' is usually an older man, normally one with power, authority, or strength, with whom one can identify on a deeply [[psychology|psychological]] level and who generates emotions generally felt towards one's father. Despite the literal term "father figure", the role of a father figure is not limited to the biological parent of a person (especially a child), but may be played by uncles, grandfathers, elder brothers, family friends, or others.&lt;ref&gt;M. E. Lamb ed., ''The Role of the Father in Child Development'' (2010) p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have suggested that positive father figures (whether biological or not) are generally associated with healthy child development,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080212095450.htm Science news]&lt;/ref&gt; both in boys and in girls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychcentral.com/lib/2012/daughters-need-fathers-too/ Daughters need fathers, too]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The ''International Dictionary of Psychology'' defines "father figure" as "A man to whom a person looks up and whom he treats like a father."&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, Stuart. ''The International Dictionary of Psychology.'' 2nd. ed. New York: Macmillan Press, 1996. 166. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''APA Concise Dictionary of Psychology'' offers a more extensive definition: "a substitute for a person's biological father, who performs typical paternal functions and serves as an object of identification and attachment. [Father figures] may include such individuals as adoptive fathers, stepfathers, older brothers, teachers and others." This dictionary goes on to state that the term is synonymous with [[father surrogate]] and [[surrogate father]].&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association. ''APA Concise Dictionary of Psychology.'' Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association, 2009. 189. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The former definition suggests that the term applies to any man, while the latter excludes biological fathers.

==Significance in child development==
As a [[primary caregiver]], a father or father-figure fills a key role in a child's life. [[Attachment theory]] offers some insight into how children relate to their fathers, and when they seek out a separate "father figure." According to a 2010 study by Posada and Kaloustian, the way that an infant models their attachment to their caregiver has a direct impact on how the infant responds to other people.&lt;ref&gt;Santrock, John W. ''Children.'' 12th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2013. 218. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These attachment-driven responses may persist throughout life.

Studies by Parke and Clark-Stewart (2011) and Lamb (2010) have shown that fathers are more likely than mothers to engage in rough-and-tumble play with children.&lt;ref&gt;Santrock, John W. ''Children.'' 12th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2013. 225. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other functions a father figure can provide include: helping establish [[personal boundaries]] between mother and child;&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''[[Families and how to survive them]]'' (1994) p. 196-9&lt;/ref&gt; promoting self-discipline, teamwork and a sense of [[gender identity]];&lt;ref&gt;Skynner, p. 21-2, p. 199-201 and p. 244-6&lt;/ref&gt; offering a window into the wider world;&lt;ref&gt;[[D. W. Winnicott]], ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (1973) p. 115-6&lt;/ref&gt; and providing opportunities for both [[Idealization and devaluation|idealisation]] and its realistic working-through.&lt;ref&gt;Winnicott, p. 116-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lack==

Studies have shown that a lack of a father figure in a child's life can have severe negative psychological impacts upon a child's personality and psychology,&lt;ref&gt;L. L. Dunlap, ''What All Children Need'' (2004) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; whereas positive father figures have a significant role in a child's development.

==Cultural aspects==

*Leaders such as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] have been seen as acting as father figures for their followers, while a similar role may be played by the therapist in the [[transference]].&lt;ref&gt;D. N. Tutoo, ''Educational Psychology'' (1998) p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Alfred Pennyworth]] is the butler and father figure to Bruce Wayne, who is also [[Batman]] in [[DC Comics]]. Alfred looks after young Bruce Wayne after his parents are murdered during a street robbery.
*[[Mycroft Holmes]] is sometimes seen to be a father figure to [[Sherlock Holmes]], especially in the 1970 film ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and in the 2010 TV series ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]''.
*[[Captain Haddock]] is mostly seen to be a father figure to [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]], especially in ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]''.
*[[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] adopted his father-in-law, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Lord Grey|Charles Grey]], as a father-figure, the consequent [[ambivalence]] in their relationship impacting negatively on their work for the [[Great Reform Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Fraser, ''Perilous Question'' (London 2013) p. 130 and p. 175-6&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] has been seen as seeking a succession of father figures, from [[Rubeus Hagrid]] to [[Albus Dumbledore]], contrasted from the role of [[Lord Voldemort]] as the counterpart and negative aspect of the father figure.&lt;ref&gt;Lana A. Whited, ''The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter'' (2004) p. 110-2&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tigger]] is always seen as a father figure to [[Roo]], especially in ''[[The Tigger Movie]]''.
*[[Bobby Singer]] is always seen as a father figure to [[Dean Winchester|Dean]] and [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] in ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''.
*[[Kingsley Martin]] said of [[Leonard Woolf]] that “he was always ready to advise me, and became, I think, something of a Father Figure to me”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in V. Glendinning, ''Leonard Woolf'' (2006) p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[John Lennon]] saw an excess of father figures as one of the common elements linking himself and [[Bob Dylan]].&lt;ref&gt;Jann Wenner, ''Lennon Remembers'' (Penguin 1975) p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2238">The '''First Viennese School''' is a name mostly used to refer to three [[composer]]s of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] in [[Western art music]] in late-18th-century [[Vienna]]: [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. ([[Franz Schubert]] is occasionally added to the list.)

In German speaking countries, the term ''Wiener Klassik'' (lit. ''Viennese classical era/art'') is used. That term is often more broadly applied to the Classical era in music as a whole, as a means to distinguish it from other periods that are colloquially referred to as ''classical'', namely [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] music.

The term "Viennese School" was first used by Austrian musicologist Raphael Georg Kiesewetter, in 1834, although he only counted Haydn and Mozart as members of the school. Other writers followed suit and eventually Beethoven was added to the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Classical|author=Heartz, Daniel|author2=Bruce Alan Brown|author2-link=Bruce Alan Brown|last-author-amp=yes|access-date=27 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designation "first" is added today to avoid confusion with the [[Second Viennese School]].

With the exception of Schubert, these composers certainly knew each other, with Haydn and Mozart even being occasional chamber-music partners. But they were not engaged in a formal effort to associate with 20th-century schools, such as the Second Viennese School, or [[Les Six]]. Nor is there any evidence that one composer was "schooled" by another, in the way that Berg and Webern were taught by Schoenberg, although it is true that Beethoven for a time received lessons from Haydn.

Attempts to extend the First Viennese School to include such later figures as [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] are merely journalistic, and never encountered in academic musicology.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The '''flag of Eswatini (Swaziland)''' was adopted on October 6, 1968&lt;ref name="Flagpost"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swaziland|url=https://flagspot.net/flags/sz.html|website=Flagpost|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Eswatini]] gained independence from the [[British Empire]] on September 6, 1968. The design of the flag is based on a flag given by [[King Sobhuza II]] to the Swazi Pioneer Corps in 1941.

== History ==

The flag is based on the military flag given by [[King Sobhuza II]] to the [[Swazi Pioneer Corps]] in 1941 to remind them of the nation's military traditions.&lt;ref name=WorldFlags&gt;{{cite web|title=Swaziland flag|url=http://www.worldflags101.com/s/swaziland-flag.aspx|website=World Flags|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 April 1967, the day the pledge of oath was taken by the king the flag was hoisted for the first time.The College of Arms in London registered the flag on 30 October 1967. The first official hoisting of the flag was conducted on this day.&lt;ref name="Flagpost" /&gt;

== Specifications ==

The flag is rectangular with length and breadth in a ratio of 3:2 respectively.&lt;ref name="Flagpost" /&gt; The red stands for past battles, the blue for peace and stability, and the yellow for the resources of Swaziland.&lt;ref name="Flagpost" /&gt; The central focus of the flag is a [[Nguni shield]] and two [[spear]]s, symbolizing protection from the country's enemies. Its colour is meant to show that white and black people live in peaceful coexistence in Swaziland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Embassy of the Kingdom of Swaziland|url=http://www.swaziland.org.tw/e12.html|website=Swaziland.org|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag has five horizontal stripes—two blue stripes at the top and bottom while the center stripe is red. Two thin yellow stripes border the red stripe. On the red stripe is an ox hide combat shield from the traditional Swazi Emasotsha Regiment, laid horizontally. The shield is reinforced by a staff from which hangs ''injobo'' tassels-bunches of feathers of the [[widowbird]] and the [[Turaco|lourie]]. They also decorate the shield. These feathers are used only by the king.&lt;ref name="Flagpost" /&gt; Above the staff are two ''assegai''s-local spears,&lt;ref name="Flagpost" /&gt; a Swazi fighting stick and three royal Swazi ornamental tassels called tinjobo, which are made from widow bird and loury feathers.&lt;ref name=WorldFlags/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6667">In the [[Mythological Cycle]] of [[early Irish literature]], the '''four treasures (or jewels) of the Tuatha Dé Danann''' are four magical items which the [[mythology|mythological]] [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] are supposed to have brought with them from the four island cities Murias, Falias, Gorias and Findias, when they arrived in Ireland.

==Sources==
Together the four treasures form the subject of at least three [[Middle Irish]] texts:
*an anecdote in an interpolated recension of the legendary ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'' ("The Book of the Taking of Ireland"), here '''LG''',
*the introduction, interpolated from ''Lebor Gabála'', of ''[[Cath Maige Tuired]]'' ("The Second Battle of Mag Tuired"), here '''CMT''',&lt;ref&gt;Although the text may go back to the 9th century, this introductory section seems to have been inserted by a Middle Irish redactor on the basis of ''Lebor Gabála''. See Gerard Murphy, "Notes on ''Cath Maige Tuired''." ''[[Éigse]]'' 7 (1954). p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; and
*"The Four Jewels", a later, short text in the [[Yellow Book of Lecan]], consisting of a prose introduction and a poem.
In the 17th century, [[Geoffrey Keating]] drew on a version of the former for his ''[[Foras Feasa ar Éirinn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Keating, ''Foras feasa ar Éirinn''. Book 1, section 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The first recension of ''Lebor Gabála'' describes the Tuatha Dé Danann as having resided in "the northern islands of the world", where they were instructed in the magic arts, before finally moving in dark clouds to Connaught in Ireland. It mentions only the ''[[Lia Fáil]]'' as having been imported from across the sea.&lt;ref&gt;''Lebor Gabála Érenn'', ed. and tr. R.A.S. Macalister. ''Lebor Gabála Érenn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland''. Part IV. Irish Texts Society 41. First Redaction. §§ 55-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the recensions of ''Lebor Gabála'', ''Cath Maige Tuired'' and a separate text elaborate on these events. CMT and LG tell that there were four cities located on the northern islands of the world (''i n-insib tūascertachaib in domain''), called Falias, Gorias, Findias and Murias.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Lebar Gabála Érenn'' Part IV § 203; ''Cath Maige Tuired'' §§ 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; "The Four Jewels" also refers to the cities, but appears to locate them at ''[[Lochlann]]'' and contends that the Tuatha Dé crossed the seas in their fleet rather than in a mist. The Tuatha Dé Danann — described as the offspring of [[Béothach]] son of Iarbonel — landed here to be instructed in the magic arts, embracing druidry (''druidecht''), knowledge (''fis''), prophecy (''fáitsine'') and skill in magic (''amainsecht''). Each island is said to have had its poet (''[[fili]]'') who was skilled in occult arts.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

When the Tuatha Dé migrated to Ireland, they are said to have brought four magical instruments from these cities:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''City'''
| '''Poet'''
| '''Item'''
| '''Properties'''

|-
| Falias
| Morfessa or Fessus
| [[Lia Fáil|Stone of Fál (''Lia Fáil'')]]
| It would cry out beneath the king who took the sovereignty of Ireland. It was supposedly located near the [[Hill of Tara]] in [[County Meath]].

|-
| Goirias or Gorias
| Esras
| [[Spear of Lugh|Spear (''sleg'') of Lug]]
| No battle was ever sustained against it, or against the man who held it.

|-
| Findias or Finias
| Uiscias or Uscias
| [[Claíomh Solais|Sword (''claideb/claiomh solais'')]] which belonged to [[Nuada Airgetlám|Núadu]]
| No one ever escaped from it once it was drawn from its sheath, and no one could resist it. The sword is also described in the Tain legend as 'Nuadu's Cainnel' - a glowing bright torch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Táin: From the Irish epic Táin Bó Cuailnge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-WoRsfK99UC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=Nuadu%27s+Cainnel|date=26 September 2002|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-150639-0|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

|-
| Muirias or Murias
| Semias
| Cauldron (''coire'') of the [[The Dagda|Dagda]]
| No company ever went away from it unsatisfied. (also known as the ''Coire ansic'')

|}

[[A. C. L. Brown]] and [[R. S. Loomis]] equate Lug's spear with the [[Lúin of Celtchar|''Lúin'' of Celtchar]], which in ''[[Togail Bruidne Dá Derga]]'' is said to have been discovered in the Battle of Mag Tuired. There is however no sign of a literary tradition which connects the two weapons. A different spear belonging to Lug is the so-called spear of Assal in ''Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann''. It was brought back to Lug by the [[sons of Tuireann]] in atonement for their killing of [[Cian]].

'''''Galileo's Middle Finger''''' is a 2015 book about the [[Medical ethics|ethics of medical research]] by [[Alice Dreger]], an American bioethicist and author.&lt;ref name="Northwestern"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioethics.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile.html?xid=17073 |title=Alice Dreger Bio |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate=Apr 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419201840/http://www.bioethics.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile.html?xid=17073 |archivedate=2014-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreger explores the relationship between science and [[social justice]] by discussing a number of scientific controversies. These include the debates surrounding [[intersex]] genital surgery, [[autogynephilia]], and anthropologist [[Napoleon Chagnon]]'s work.

==Synopsis==

The first part of ''Galileo's Middle Finger'' recounts Dreger's activism against surgical "correction" of [[intersex]] individuals' genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/barronlerner/2015/03/13/science-activism-and-truth-galileos-middle-finger-by-alice-dreger/ | author = Lerner, Barron | date = March 13, 2015 | title = Science, Activism And Truth: 'Galileo's Middle Finger' by Alice Dreger | work = Forbes.com | accessdate = March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some surgeons called this "total urogenital mobilization" which is "...ripping out everything that didn't seem right to the doctor and rebuilding a girl's genitals from scratch using Frankenstein stitches..."&lt;ref name="gal47"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and the Search for Justice in Science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 | page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, her book discusses the [[intersex medical interventions]] that some intersex children in the United States undergo. Based on her interactions with the intersex community as well as her own research, she advocated that genital surgery for intersex children be postponed until the individual is old enough to make an informed decision, in the absence of any evidence that the benefits of such surgery outweighed its already reported risks.

The second section provides her analysis of the controversy surrounding ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'' (2003), by sex researcher and psychologist [[J. Michael Bailey]]. In that book, Bailey summarized research on [[Blanchard's transsexualism typology]] in a way that Dreger says is scientifically accurate, well-intended, and sympathetic, but insensitive to its political implications. Dreger writes that "Bailey made the mistake of thinking that openly accepting and promoting the truth about people's identities would be understood as the same as accepting them and helping them, as he felt he was".&lt;ref name="gal65"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and the Search for Justice in Science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 | page = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, many activists in the trans community objected to the contention that their transition was sexually motivated.

Bailey's book was based on the academic publications of psychologist [[Ray Blanchard]], which Bailey interpreted for a lay audience. The larger audience and potential to influence public beliefs about transgenderism led a prominent transgender activist, [[Lynn Conway]], to campaign against Bailey.  Dreger concludes that the accusations levied against Bailey by Conway and others did not hold up to scrutiny. "Conway developed what became an enormous Web site hosted by the University of Michigan for the purpose of taking down Bailey and his ideas [and] that largely enabled me to figure out what she had really done and how Bailey had essentially been set up in an effort to shut him up about [[autogynephilia]]".&lt;ref name="gal65" /&gt; Dreger wrote that some activists had turned their horror at Bailey's findings into a very public vendetta against him and his family, including thinly veiled allegations that he sexually abused his children.&lt;ref name="bartlett"&gt;{{cite news | author = Bartlett, Tom | date = March 10, 2015 | title = Reluctant Crusader: Why Alice Dreger’s writing on sex and science makes liberals so angry | work = [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] | url = http://chronicle.com/article/Reluctant-Crusader/228377/?cid=gn | accessdate = March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After researching the allegations against Bailey, she concluded that they were false.  Moreover, Dreger observed that "the most interesting mail, from my perspective, came from trans women who wrote to tell me that, though they weren't thrilled with Bailey's oversimplifications of their lives, they also had been harassed and intimidated by [[Andrea James]] for daring to speak anything other than the politically popular 'I was always just a woman trapped in a man's body' story. They thanked me for standing up to a bully."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and the Search for Justice in Science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 | page = 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreger also investigates the controversy surrounding biologist [[Randy Thornhill]] and anthropologist Craig T. Palmer's ''[[A Natural History of Rape]]'' (2000) and accusations by Patrick Tierney in his book ''[[Darkness in El Dorado]]'' that anthropologist [[Napoleon Chagnon]] seriously abused the [[Yanomamo]]. She returns to the issue of intersex in an examination of geneticist [[Maria New]]'s research in prenatal [[dexamethasone]] use in cases of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].

==Reception==

''[[The New York Times]]'' described the book as "a rant, a manifesto, a treasury of evocative new terms ([[sissyphobia]], [[autogynephilia]], [[Phall-O-Meter|phall-o-meter]]) and an account of the author’s transformation" from activist to scientist and back again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/books/review/galileos-middle-finger-by-alice-dreger.html?_r=0 |title=‘Galileo’s Middle Finger,’ by Alice Dreger |last1=Dobbs |first1=David |date=April 17, 2015 |website= |publisher= [[The New York Times]] |access-date=2015-07-20 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' describes the book as "highly readable" with an important message: "Science and social justice require each other to be healthy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Miller, Laura | title = "Galileo’s Middle Finger": When scholars and activists clash over controversial research, we all lose.

The book was at first selected as 2016 finalist for a [[Lambda Literary Award]] in the LGBTQ nonfiction category, but the foundation rescinded this nomination on March 22, 2016, describing the book as "inconsistent with its mission of affirming LGBTQ lives."&lt;ref name="Lambda Literary award withdrawal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/712366965466206208|title=Lambda Literary award withdrawal|accessdate=Mar 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brynn Tannehill, writing for ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', compared arguments made in the book to the arguments made by anti-transgender groups like the [[Family Research Council]]. She wrote that the book promoted a theory that trans people are "just self-hating homosexual men who believe they could have guilt-free sex if they were female and heterosexual men with an out-of-control fetish (autogynephilia)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tannehill |first=Brynn |date=March 25, 2016 |title=Lambda Literary Foundation Snuffs Out Anti-Trans Scandal |url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2016/3/25/lambda-literary-foundation-snuffs-out-anti-trans-scandal |newspaper=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |access-date=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinnia Jones, a trans activist writer, criticised the book as providing an "incomplete and sensationalized" depiction of the subject which selectively covers claims made by proponents, ignoring those which might present it in a worse light. She also highlighted perceived methodological flaws with the research conducted by Blanchard and others, especially a willingness to ignore data points which are inconsistent with their hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Zinna|url=http://genderanalysis.net/2016/04/alice-dreger-autogynephilia-and-the-misrepresentation-of-trans-sexualities-book-review-galileos-middle-finger/|accessdate=2017-07-04|date=2016-04-01|title=Alice Dreger, autogynephilia, and the misrepresentation of trans sexualities (Book review: Galileo’s Middle Finger)|website=genderanalysis.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|[[Science]], and particularly [[geometry]] and [[astronomy]], was linked directly to the divine for most medieval scholars. Since God created the universe after geometric and harmonic principles, to seek these principles was therefore to seek and worship God.]]
The '''Great Architect of the Universe''' (also '''Grand Architect of the Universe''' or '''Supreme Architect of the Universe''') is a [[conceptions of God|conception of God]] discussed by many [[Christian]] [[theologians]] and [[apologists]].  As a designation it is used within [[Freemasonry]] to represent the [[deity]] neutrally (in whatever form, and by whatever name each member may individually believe in).  It is also a [[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception#The Rosicrucian conception of God and the scheme of evolution|Rosicrucian conception of God]], as expressed by [[Max Heindel]].  The concept of the [[demiurge]] as a grand architect or a great architect also occurs in [[gnosticism]] and other religious and philosophical systems.

Hinduism equally hails the creation of undoubtedly wonderful architecture and engineering.

==Christianity==
The concept of [[God]] as the Great Architect of the Universe has been used many times within [[Christianity]]. An illustration of God as the architect of the universe can be found in a [[Bible]] from the Middle Ages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europhysicsnews.org/articles/epn/pdf/2004/03/epn04303.pdf Hog, Erik. "The depth of the heavens: Belief and knowledge during 2500 years"] (pdf file) ''Europhysics News'', (2004), '''35'''(3), p. 78, .&lt;/ref&gt; and the comparison of God to an architect has been used by Christian apologists and teachers.

[[Thomas Aquinas]] said in the [[Summa Theologica|Summa]]: "God, Who is the first principle of all things, may be compared to things created ''as the architect is to things designed'' (''ut artifex ad artificiata'')."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.josephkenny.joyeurs.com/CDtexts/summa/FP/FP027.html#FPQ27OUTP1 ''Summa Theologica''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317185243/http://www.josephkenny.joyeurs.com/CDtexts/summa/FP/FP027.html |date=2012-03-17 }} I. 27, 1, r.o. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Commentators have pointed out that the assertion that the Grand Architect of the Universe is the Christian God "is not evident on the basis of 'natural theology' alone but requires an additional 'leap of faith' based on the revelation of the Bible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faithnet.org.uk/Theology/aquinas.htm|title=Thomas Aquinas (1225&amp;ndash;1274)|author=Stephen A. Richards|publisher=Pelusa Media Group|year=2006|work=Theology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Calvin]], in his ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' (1536), repeatedly calls the Christian God "the Architect of the Universe", also referring to his works as "Architecture of the Universe", and in his commentary on [[Psalms|Psalm 19]] refers to the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] as the "Great Architect" or "Architect of the Universe".

The concept of a Great Architect of the Universe also occurs in [[Martinism]]. Martinist doctrine is that the Great Architect must not be worshipped. Martinists hold that while it is possible to "invoque" him, it is not to adore him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientmartinistorder.org/readings/6.html|title=The Martinist Doctrine|author=Aurifer|date=2005-09-11|publisher=Sovereign Grand Lodge of the Ancient Martinist Order}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
In the Hindu mythology, Lord [[Vishvakarman]] is regarded as the “God of Architecture”. He is the supremo of craftsmanship, perfection engineering.  '''Viśhwákarma''' (meaning "all creating" in [[Sanskrit]]) is the deity of the creative power that holds the universe together according to the ''[[Rigveda]]'' and is considered to be the original creator, architect, divine engineer of the universe from before the advent of time, also the root concept of the later [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] figures of [[Brahman]] and [[Purusha]] in the historical Vedic religion.

Hindu scriptures describe many of Vishwakarma's architectural accomplishments.

Through the four [[yugas]] (aeons of Hindu mythology), he had built several towns and palaces for the [[gods]]. Among them were, in chronological order, [[Svarga]](Heaven) in the '''Satya Yuga''', [[Lanka]] in the '''Treta Yuga''', and [[Dvārakā|Dwarka]] (Krishna's capital) in the '''Dwapara Yuga.'''


==Freemasonry==
[[History of Freemasonry|Masonic historians]] such as William Bissey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=William K. Bissey|work=The Indiana Freemason|date=Spring 1997|title=G.A.O.T.U.|url=http://srjarchives.tripod.com/1997-08/Bissey.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Leazer (quoting ''Coil's Masonic Encyclopaedia''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Praying in Lodge|year=2001|author=Gary Leazer|url=http://www.hampton70.org/research/leazer/prayer.htm|work=Masonic Research|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813213541/http://www.hampton70.org/research/leazer/prayer.htm|archivedate=13 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[S. Brent Morris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[S. Brent Morris]]|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Freemasonry|publisher=Alpha/Penguin Books|isbn=1-59257-490-4|page=212|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; assert that "the Masonic abbreviation G.A.O.T.U., meaning the Great Architect of the Universe, continues a long tradition of using an allegorical name for the Deity."  They trace how the name and the abbreviation entered Masonic tradition from the ''[[Constitutions of the Free-Masons|Book of Constitutions]]'' written in 1723 by the Reverend [[James Anderson (Mason)|James Anderson]].  They also note that Anderson, a Calvinist minister, probably took the term from Calvin's usage.

Christopher Haffner's own explanation of how the Masonic concept of a Great Architect of the Universe, as a placeholder for the Supreme Being of one's choice, is given in ''Workman Unashamed'':
{{quote|Now imagine me standing in lodge with my head bowed in prayer between Brother Mohammed Bokhary and Brother Arjun Melwani. To neither of them is the Great Architect of the Universe perceived as the [[Holy Trinity]]. To Brother Bokhary He has been revealed as [[God in Islam|Allah]]; to Brother Melwani He is probably perceived as [[Vishnu]]. Since I believe that [[monotheism|there is only one God]], I am confronted with three possibilities:
:They are praying to ''the devil'' whilst I am praying to God;
:They are praying to ''nothing'', as their Gods do not exist;
:They are praying to the ''same God'' as I, yet their understanding of His nature is partly incomplete (as indeed is mine &amp;mdash; [[1 Corinthians 13|1 Cor 13:]]12)
It is without hesitation that I accept the third possibility..
|4=Christopher Haffner
|5=Workman Unashamed: The Testimony of a Christian Freemason, Lewis Masonic, 1989, p.39}}

The [[Swedish Rite]], which has the prerequisite of professing to Christian Faith, uses the form "The ''Threefold'' Great Architect of the Universe".

==Hermeticism==
The Great Architect may also be a metaphor alluding to the godhead potentiality of every individual. "(God)... That invisible power which all know does exist, but understood by many different names, such as God, Spirit, Supreme Being, Intelligence, Mind, Energy, Nature and so forth." &lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Slipper, ''The Symbolism of the Eastern Star'' Pages 35 and 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hermeticism]], each and every person has the potential to become God, this idea or concept of God is perceived as internal rather than external. The Great Architect is also an allusion to the observer created universe. We create our own reality; hence we are the architect. Another way would be to say that the mind is the builder.

==Rosicrucianism==
{{See also|The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception}}
In Max Heindel's exposition, the Great Architect of the Universe is the Supreme Being, who proceeds from The Absolute, at the dawn of manifestation.

==Gnosticism==
The concept of the Great Architect of the Universe occurs in [[Gnosticism]]. The [[demiurge]] is the Great Architect of the Universe, the God of Old Testament, in opposition to Christ and Sophia, messengers of Gnosis of the True God.
For example: Gnostics such as the Nasoræans believe the Pira Rabba is the source, origin, and container of all things, which is filled by the Mânâ Rabbâ, the Great Spirit, from which emanates the First Life.  The First Life prays for companionship and progeny, whereupon the Second Life, the Ultra Mkayyema or World-constituting Æon, the Architect of the Universe, comes into being.  From this architect come a number of [[æon]]s, who erect the universe under the foremanship of the Mandâ d'Hayye or gnôsis zoês, the Personified Knowledge of Life.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Nasoræans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Others==
[[James Hopwood Jeans]], in his book ''[[The Mysterious Universe]]'', also employs the concept of a Great Architect of the Universe, saying at one point "Lapsing back again into the crudely anthropomorphic language we have already used, we may say that we have already considered with disfavour the possibility of the universe having been planned by a biologist or an engineer; from the intrinsic evidence of his creation, the Great Architect of the Universe now begins to appear as a pure mathematician."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Quotations/Jeans.html|title=Quotations by James Jeans|author=JOC/EFR|date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advaitavedanta.co.uk/content/view/230/0/|date=2005-11-04|title=Mathematics and Mysticism|work=Wisdom's Frame of Reference|publisher=Advaita Vedanta|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that [[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa|Jinarajadasa]] adds his observation that the Great Architect is "also a Grand Geometrician. For in some manner or other, whether obvious or hidden, there seems to be a geometric basis to every object in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.subtleenergies.com/ORMUS/oc/intro.htm|chapter=Introduction to the third edition|title=Occult Chemistry|author=Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa|authorlink=Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa|date=1950-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Comment The concept of a Great Architect of the Universe in [[Hinduism]] is described in the [[Vedas]] and other ancient scriptures. [[Mandala 10|Rigveda Mandala 10]] presents the concepts of [[Vishvakarman]],&lt;ref&gt;Ṛigveda, 10.82.5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Purusha]] (see [[Purusha sukta]]), and [[Prajapathi]] (see [[Nasadiya sukta]]), who sacrificed themselves and become this cosmos.{{fact}}

==Gameplay==
All of the games are played from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective, and the player must move around the massive battleground (using the [[analog stick]]s and buttons on the two gun controllers), while using the [[Light gun|Gun Controllers]] to aim and shoot at enemies. The goal is to survive and shoot down the rival [[Team deathmatch|team]] to decrease the opposing team's team meter within a given time limit. The round ends when either teams' team meter drops to zero and/or if the timer reaches zero.

Players can switch weapons in-battle, utilizing various strategies and tactics, by melding the two gun controllers together into different positions, such as:
*Side Style: by clipping the side of the gun controllers together, the players can use their character's secondary arsenal.
*Tandem Style: by clipping the tip of right gun controller onto the top of the left gun controller, the players can use their character's powerful arsenal.

As the players progressed to the game's multiplayer mode, those who using the [[NESiCAxLive]] card can accumulate "Team Points" by winning battles, and using it to purchase and equip "Weapon Packs". Weapons Packs are a set of weapons that can be purchased and use in battle. Some of the packs has upgraded versions of the character's default weapons with boosted stats.

==Plot==

===Setting===
In 2115, the country known formerly as [[Japan]] has been split into two [[Multiverse|parallel worlds]]: the {{nihongo|''Frontier S (Stratos)''|フロンティアS（ストラトス）|Furontia S (sutoratosu)}} and the {{nihongo|''17th Far East Imperial City Management District''|第十七極東帝都管理区|Dai jū nana Kyokutō no teikoku kanri-ku}}. Frontier S is an outlaw universe in which freedom runs rampant, while the 17th Far East Imperial City Management District is a totalitarian universe completely bereft of freedom and is under constant surveillance. When the two universes are starting to fuse into one, the government of each worlds initiates the {{nihongo|''Operation Stratos''|オペレーション・ストラトス|Operēshon sutoratosu}}, a world-scale protocol wherein a handpicked group of [[gunslinger]]s, mercenaries, and special individuals, each from the two universes, will be sent in the year 2015 to alter the past by eliminating the other side until only one group survives, erasing a parallel universe in the process.

===Story===
The story revolves on a group of [[gunslinger]]s, each from the [[Multiverse|two universes]] who participate in Operation Stratos, particularly on a group of four childhood friends: Tohru Kazasumi, Kyōka Katagiri, Kyōma Katagiri, and Shizune Rindo, who all must confront their own flaws and differences when they battle their alternate selves in order to survive.

'''Invitational Education (IE)''' is an [[Education theory|educational theory]] of practice introduced by co-founders Dr. William Watson Purkey and Dr. [[Betty Siegel]] of the International Alliance for Invitational Education (IAIE).&lt;ref name="zeeman2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeeman|first=Roger D.|title=Glasser's Choice Theory and Purkey's Invitational Education-Allied Approaches to Counseling and Schooling|journal=Journal of Invitational Theory and Practice|date=2006|volume=12|pages=46–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purkey is professor emeritus of [[counselor education]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]] and writes prolifically as a catalyst for [[school improvement]]. In addition, Dr. John Novak, professor emeritus at [[Brock University]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], is a primary contributor to the development of Invitational Theory and Practice, authoring numerous books on the subject and lecturing internationally.
[[File:Betty Siegel.jpeg|thumbnail|Dr. Betty Siegel]]

IE emphasizes the importance of internal knowledge in relation to external connections to the outside world and existing educational systems.&lt;ref name="zeeman2006" /&gt; A key feature of IE is positive [[self-concept]] developed through a school environment that leads to more [[productivity]].&lt;ref name="zeeman2006" /&gt;

Purkey writes, "At its heart, Invitational Education is an imaginative act of hope that explains how human potential can be realized. It identifies and changes the forces that defeat and destroy people. Invitational Education is designed to create and enhance human environments that cordially summon people to realize their potential in all areas of worthwhile human endeavor." &lt;ref name="Purkey 2015"&gt;Purkey, William Watson and Novak, John Michael. Fundamentals of Invitational Education. New York: The International Alliance for Invitational Education, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; "Invitational Education asserts that organizations are never neutral. Everything and everybody either adds to or subtracts from an existing culture. Invitational Education offers concrete, practice, safe, successful and democratic solutions for problems that routinely harm organizations and the people within them."

Invitational Education recognizes five Domains which comprise everyone and every thing in an '''organization'''. The Domains include People, Places, Policies, Programs and Processes. These domains will either build or destroy intellectual, social, physical, emotional and moral potential for stakeholders. Adjusting these domains, Invitational Education's theory and practices have been embedded in schools around the world at all levels, from [[nursery school]]s to universities. In addition, Invitational Education has strengthened [[health care]] facilities, businesses, non-profits, worship centers and families.&lt;ref name="Purkey 2015"/&gt;

In ''[[Visible Learning]]'', [[John Hattie]]'s meta-analysis of school improvement research, Hattie writes, "[Invitational Education] is not 'niceness' at work, but an approach that places much reliance on the teachers and schools to make learning exciting, engaging, and enduring. Where there are school differences, it is these types of effects that are the most powerful." Hattie's research determined that many of the most hotly debated [[school reform]] efforts had little effect on school improvement, but those which provide in invitation to learn had the most profound effect.&lt;ref&gt;Hattie, John. Visible Learning: A Synthesis of Over 800 Meta-Analyses Relating to Achievement, (pp.&amp;nbsp;33–34). New York: Routledge, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also applying Invitational Education are authors [[Harry Wong|Harry]] and Rosemary Wong. In their book, ''The First Days of School'', the Wongs explain that effective teachers invite their students and their colleagues to learn together. "An invitation makes a person feel able, responsible and valuable. Effective teachers have the power and the ability to maintain an inviting stance in the classroom." &lt;ref&gt;Wong, Harry K. &amp; Rosemary T. (2009). ''The First Days of School''. (4th ed.) Harry K.&lt;/ref&gt;

This has since been transferred to the American publisher Fons Vitae.&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;[http://www.circleofone.org/about/Board/Virginia_Gray.html Mention of QE] in the profile of Gray Henry at Circle of One.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grayzoom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Holdijk" /&gt;

'''Kensington Publishing Corp.''' is a New York-based publishing house founded in 1974 by [[Walter Zacharius]] (1923–2011)&lt;ref name=Zacharius-obit&gt;Grimes, William.

It is the house of many ''New York Times'' bestselling authors, including [[Fern Michaels]], [[Lisa Jackson (author)|Lisa Jackson]], [[Joanne Fluke]] and [[William W. Johnstone]]. In addition to the over 500 new titles that the company publishes each year, it has a vast and diverse backlist that includes classics such as ''[[The Minority Report]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]], ''[[Johnny Got His Gun]]'' by [[Dalton Trumbo]], ''[[I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell]]'' by [[Tucker Max]] and ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

Kensington's imprints include [[Zebra Books]], Pinnacle Books, Dafina, Citadel Press, and Lyrical Press, which provide readers with a range of popular genres such as romance, women’s fiction, African American, young adult and nonfiction, as well as true-crime, western, and mystery titles.

== History ==
Kensington Books was founded by Walter Zacharius and Roberta Bender Grossman in 1974 as the successor to the paperback publisher [[Lancer Books]], specializing in paperback [[romance novels]].&lt;ref name=Zacharius-obit /&gt; The [[Zebra Books]] and Pinnacle Books imprints debuted in 1975. Rather than bookstores, the company's books were generally sold in railroad stations, airports, bus terminals, and drug stores.&lt;ref name=Zacharius-obit /&gt;

In 2008, Kensington acquired the publishing assets of '''Holloway House''' (publishers of [[Iceberg Slim]] and [[Donald Goines]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/book-deals/article/831-kensington-acquires-holloway-house-backlist.html |title=Kensington Acquires Holloway House Backlist |website=PublishersWeekly.com |date=2008-02-20 |accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-founder Walter Zacharius died in 2011. In addition to having run Lancer Books from 1961–1973, Zacharius authored the [[World War II]] novel ''Songbird'', published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 2004 and republished  by Kensington Books in 2007 as ''The Memories We Keep''.&lt;ref name=Zacharius-obit /&gt;

==Management==
Steven Zacharius, son of founder Walter Zacharius,&lt;ref name=Zacharius-obit /&gt; has been with the company since 1993 and has been President and CEO since 2005. He is also chairman of Kensington. The company's vice president, Michael Rosamilia, has been the [[CFO]] since 1989. Adam Zacharius, Steven's son, is General Manager and originally started working with Kensington seven years ago.{{When|date=January 2017}} Kensington is believed{{By whom|date=January 2017}} to be the only publishing company with three generations of family management.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The staff totals over 85 employees and, in addition to its internal sales team, Kensington has a distribution agreement with [[Penguin Random House]] Publisher Services’ global sales force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.biz/publisherservices/news/archive/PRHPS_Kensington-Press-Release-Final_7-1-14.pdf |title=Press Release |date=2014-07-01 |accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keri Hulme''' (born 9 March 1947) is a New Zealand novelist, poet, and short-story writer. Her novel, ''[[The Bone People]]'', won the [[Man Booker Prize]] in 1985. She was the first New Zealander to win this award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191823510.001.0001/acref-9780191823510-e-63|title=Hulme, Keri - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780191823510.001.0001/acref-9780191823510-e-63|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hulme's writing explores themes of isolation, postcolonial and multicultural identity,  and [[Māori mythology|Maori]], [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], and [[Norse mythology]]. She has also written under the pen name Kai Tainui. 

== Early life ==
Hulme was born in [[Christchurch]], in New Zealand's [[South Island]]. The daughter of John W., a carpenter, and Mere, a credit manager, she was the eldest of six children.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Book Council bio"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bookcouncil.org.nz/writer/hulme-keri |title= Hulme, Keri |author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= April 2016|website= www.bookcouncil.org.nz |publisher= [[New Zealand Book Council]] | accessdate= 13 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&amp;u=ohlnk20&amp;id=GALE%7CH1000048141&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;authCount=1#|title=Keri Hulme|last=Contemporary Authors Online|first=|date=2012|website=GALE Literature Resource Center|access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were of English, Scottish, and [[Māori people|Māori]] ([[Ngāi Tahu|Kai Tahu]]) descent. "Our family comes from diverse people: Kai Tahu, [[Kāti Māmoe]] (South Island Maori iwi); [[Orkney|Orkney islanders]]; [[Lancashire]] folk; [[Faroese people|Faroese]] and/or [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] migrants," Hulme told ''Contemporary Women Poets''&lt;ref&gt;"Keri Hulme." Contemporary Women Poets. St. James Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Her early education was at North New Brighton Primary School and [[Aranui High School]]. Her father died when she was 11 years old.

Hulme worked as a tobacco picker in [[Motueka]] after high school. She began studying for an honours law degree at the [[University of Canterbury]] in 1967, but left after four terms and returned to tobacco picking, continuing to write throughout this period.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Book Council bio" /&gt;

==Career==
By 1972, she decided to begin writing full-time, but, despite family support, was forced to go back to work nine months later. She continued writing, some of her work appearing under the pseudonym Kai Tainui. During this time, she continued working on her novel, ''The Bone People'', ultimately published in February 1984. The novel has been praised{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} for its use of language and Maori mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://academic.eb.com/levels/collegiate/article/Keri-Hulme/461|title= Britannica Academic|website= academic.eb.com|language= en-US|access-date= 2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before it was accepted by the Spiral Collective, a feminist literary and arts collective in New Zealand, several publishers rejected the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191823510.001.0001/acref-9780191823510-e-63|title= Hulme, Keri - Oxford Reference|language= en|doi= 10.1093/acref/9780191823510.001.0001/acref-9780191823510-e-63|access-date= 2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won the 1984 New Zealand Book Award for Fiction and the [[Booker Prize]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Keri Hulme." Contemporary Poets, 7th ed. St. James Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Zealand Book Council bio"/&gt; Hulme was the first New Zealander to win the Booker.

Hulme held the 1977 [[Robert Burns Fellowship]] and became writer-in-residence at the [[University of Otago]] in 1978, and at the University of Canterbury in 1985. She has served as the Patron of [[New Zealand Republic]] since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==
===Lexicostatistics===
The proposed measures used for linguisitic distance reflect varying understandings of the term itself. One approach is based on [[mutual intelligibility]], i.e. the ability of speakers of one language to understand the other language. With this, the higher the linguistic distance, the lower is the level of mutual intelligibility.&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"&gt;{{Citation | title=Receptive multilingualism: linguistic analyses, language policies, and didactic concepts |author1=Jan D. ten Thije |author2=Ludger Zeevaert | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2007 | isbn=978-90-272-1926-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gIEN068J3gC | quote=''... Assuming that intelligibility is inversely related to linguistic distance ... the content words the percentage of cognates (related directly or via a synonym) ... lexical relatedness ... grammatical relatedness ...''|date=2007-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[cognate|cognate words]] play an important role in mutual intelligibility between languages, these figure prominently in such analyses. The higher the percentage of cognate (as opposed to non-cognate) words in the two languages with respect to one another, the lower is their linguistic distance. Also, the greater the degree of grammatical relatedness (i.e. the cognates mean roughly similar things) and lexical relatedness (i.e. the cognates are easily discernible as related words), the lower is the linguistic distance.&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"/&gt; As an example of this, the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''pānch'' is grammatically identical and [[lexical similarity|lexically similar]] (but non-identical) to its cognate [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''panj'' as well as to the lexically dissimilar but still grammatically identical [[Greek language|Greek]] ''pent-''&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Greek and Latin roots in English#P]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[English language|English]] ''five''. As another example, the English ''dish'' and [[German language|German]] ''tisch'' 'table' are lexically (phonologically) similar but grammatically (semantically) dissimilar. Cognates in related languages can even be identical in form, but semantically distinct, such as ''caldo'' and ''largo'', which mean respectively  'hot' and 'wide' in Italian but 'broth, soup' and 'long' in Spanish. Using a statistical approach (called [[lexicostatistics]]) by comparing each language's mass of words, distances can be calculated between them. In technical terms, what is calculated is the [[Levenshtein distance]].&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"/&gt; Based on this, one study compared both [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] with [[Dutch language|Dutch]] to see which was closer to Dutch. It determined that the Dutch and Afrikaans (mutual distance of 20.9%) were considerably closer than Dutch and West Frisian (mutual distance of 34.2%).&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"/&gt;

However, lexicostatistical methods, which are based on retentions from a common proto-language – and not innovations – are problematic due to a number of reasons, so some linguists argue they cannot be relied upon during the tracing of a phylogenetic tree (for example, highest retention rates can sometimes be found in the opposite, peripheral ends of a language family).&lt;ref name="phyloproblems"&gt;http://www.elisanet.fi/alkupera/Problems_of_phylogenetics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual innovativeness or conservativeness of a language can distort linguistic distance and the assumed separation date, examples being [[Romani language]] and [[East Baltic languages]] respectively.&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt; On the one hand, continued [[Language contact|adjacency]] of closely related languages after their separation can make some loanwords 'invisible' (indistinguishable from cognates, see [[etymological nativization]]), therefore,  from lexicostatistical point of view these languages appear less distant then they actually are (examples being [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] and [[Saami languages]]).&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt; On the other hand, strong foreign influence of languages spreading far from their homeland can make them share less inherited words than they should do (examples being [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Samoyedic languages]] in the East Uralic branch).&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt;

===Other internal aspects===
Besides cognates, other aspects that are often measured are similarities of [[syntax]] and written forms.&lt;ref name="chiswick2004hsk"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chiswick | first1 = B. R. | last2 = Miller | first2 = P.

To overcome the aforementioned problems of the lexicostatistical methods, [[Donald Ringe]], [[Tandy Warnow]] and [[Luay Nakhleh]] developed a complex phylogenetical method relying on phonological and morphological innovations in 2000s.&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt;

===Language learning===
A 2004 paper by economists Barry Chiswick and Paul Miller attempted to put forth a metric for linguistic distances that was based on empirical observations of how rapidly speakers of a given language gained proficiency in another one when immersed in a society that overwhelmingly communicated in the latter language. In this study, the speed of English language acquisition was studied for immigrants of various linguistic backgrounds in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].{{Vague|date=January 2014}}&lt;ref name="chiswick2004hsk"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38217">{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Clone High'' characters}}
This is a list of all the characters that have appeared in the animated American-Canadian [[science fiction|science-fiction]]/[[situation comedy]] series ''[[Clone High]]'' (2002–2003). The series was created by the duo [[Phil Lord and Chris Miller]]. It still occasionally airs reruns on [[Teletoon]] and was briefly aired by [[MTV]] and [[MTV2]] in 2003.

==Development==
According to co-creator Miller the reason for putting historical figures in a school setting was that "We chose these characters because they're sort of mythic figures, even people with a very limited knowledge of history have some preconceived ideas about them, which is part of the fun." Lord adds, "The point of the whole show is that these people are not living up to their genetic forebears."&lt;ref name="Freshman animators"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/17/entertainment/et-solomon17|title=Freshman animators|publisher=articles.latimes.com|date=2003-02-27|accessdate=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord and Miller also explained that the development of the character of Gandhi as a " party animal" was because they researched that the young Gandhi was "immature" and "into partying" before witnessing the suffering in [[South Africa]]. Another was the reason why they introduced Ponce De León so late in the show, as a parody of how ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' would bring in characters that were never seen before and then kill them off in a melodramatic fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlhFghZ1gM |title=Clone High NEW Behind the Scenes Discussion |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main characters==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cloneparents.jpg|500px|left|thumb|List of main characters and their cloneparents, left to right: Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Joan of Arc, Cleopatra and Gandhi]] --&gt;

===Abe Lincoln===
'''Abe Lincoln''' is the clone of [[Abraham Lincoln]], the 16th [[President of the United States]]. He is the main protagonist of the series, and most of the episodes are seen through his [[Point of view (literature)|point of view]]. Abe is an average, awkward, naive, shy, clumsy yet kind teenager who feels he is struggling to live up to the legacy of Abraham Lincoln.

He has been friends with Gandhi since they were babies and also good friends with Joan. Throughout season one Abe desperately pursued Cleopatra, his love interest; at first she used him but he had eventually won her love and becomes her boyfriend starting at the end of the episode ''Sleep of Faith'' in which she agreed to go out with him after he won a drag race (despite the fact Cleo ditched him to be with JFK), they did not start a real relationship until the episode ''Plane Crazy''.

Abe is very skinny and physically weak to complement his weak-willed and indecisive nature and he is claimed to weigh only 104 pounds despite being one of the tallest students in the school. He is often seen to fall into [[peer pressure]] despite his moral values. Though intelligent, he is very unaware when it comes to other people's feelings, as he regularly insulted his friend Joan without even realizing it. He has a bitter rivalry with JFK, mostly involving his attempts to win over Cleopatra and a possible joke to one president being Republican and the other Democrat. Another reason for their rivalry is because JFK is secretly angry over how Abe treats Joan on a daily basis in his attempt to win Cleopatra over.

He is unaware that his best friend Joan of Arc is in love with him, and even when she makes advances upon him or professes her love, he seems obstinately stuck in viewing her as his "girl friend, not his girlfriend", even to the point of improbably re-interpreting some of her statements and actions as gestures of friendship or humor(something of which JFK is angry about). In the series finale, Abe realizes his feelings for Joan are more than platonic. However, this was only after Cleopatra had given her an involuntary make-over for the prom and the anger he feels when he finds Joan with JFK. Before, Abe was oblivious to the fact that Cleo is attempting to drive a wedge between him and Joan and Gandhi, who she views as being detrimental to her image. When alone with Cleo, he found himself thinking about Joan more. Eventually, Abe realizes her true nature in driving away his friends and sees Cleo for the shallow person she is inside. After ending his relationship with Cleo, he rushes to Joan's house to tell her the truth of his feelings for her. By the time he got there to tell her, Abe discovers to his dismay that Joan has moved on and is in a relationship with JFK.

He is 16 years old. He drives a white 1960s-esque [[Lincoln Continental]]. He is captain of the basketball team because he is the tallest guy at school and on the cross country team though it is clear he lacks athleticism, and he is the president of the anti-drug club. His famous catchphrase is "[[Home run|Dinger]]!" often said out of great excitement or frustration.

Abe is usually seen wearing a white T-shirt with a blue collar and blue sleeves, long, baggy cargo jeans and sneakers. He is very tall, skinny and gangly. He has messy brown hair and a scruffy black chin-strap beard (without a mustache) and a mole on his left cheek

Voice by [[Will Forte]]. ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' references Clone High by casting Forte as the voice of Lego Abe Lincoln.

===Joan of Arc===
'''Joan of Arc''' is the clone of [[Joan of Arc|Jeanne d'Arc]], the devout 15th century [[France|French]] militant. She is Abe's closest friend and is obviously in love with him (everyone knows it except Abe himself), though his constant ignorance of this causes her a lot of frustration.

In the episode ''ADD: The Last D Stands for Disorder'' Joan admits to being a "[[goth fashion|goth]]" and has a very moody, cynical, aloof, sarcastic and angst-ridden personality. She has a tendency to erupt melodramatically into tears, usually when Abe ignores her advances or scores with Cleopatra. She hates Cleopatra considering her to be a [[bimbo]] and a snob but develops a special hatred when Cleo starts dating Abe and when she is forced to live with Cleo because her house burnt down. Joan prefers to confide in various characters such as Mr. Butlertron, Gandhi, and Jesus Cristo when she needs emotional support, though she also frequently allows Abe to obliviously confide in her regarding his infatuation with Cleo and their amorous affairs together, much to her emotional detriment.

Joan is also very intelligent, well-read, witty and highly ethical and will speak up for what she believes in, though she is always ignored by the others as they see her as being too "outspoken". She serves as an environmentalist, a vegetarian and activist. mated to be attractive, though she does not recognize or emphasize this and dutifully wears an [[orthodontic retainer]]. Joan has proven to appeal to the other male characters, notably JFK whom frequently harasses her. Despite this, he is secretly attracted to Joan not only because she is immune to his charms, but also he is the only one who sees more to her as a person than Abe. In the Series Finale after realizing that Abe will never see her more than a friend, JFK comforts Joan and takes her to the prom with him. It's there that she realizes her feelings for JFK and sees more to him than the arrogant jock he usually displays in front of others. When Abe came over to her house to finally tell her the truth that he is in love with her, Joan has moved on and begins a relationship with JFK. 

She is 16 years old. She is an [[agnostic]] (she rejects religion but is not disinclined to accepting the existence of God), which puts her at odds with the real Jeanne d'Arc who was a devout Christian (this was once explained by feeling unable to live up to the real Jeanne d'Arc). Joan makes home-movies to express herself artistically. In the episode ''Makeover, Makeover, Makeover'', Abe prints flyers of her in order to get her a date for the prom and the flyer describes her as ''[[Janeane Garofalo]]esque''.

Joan's appearance consists of a tight black long-sleeved shirt and tight green cargo pants with black boots. She has pale skin, [[shades of red|dark red hair]], wears black eye liner, purple lipstick and a black choker around her neck. When Cleo gave her a makeover, she wore a different hairstyle, purple eyeshadow and eyeliner, red lipstick a tight black sleeveless leather [[minidress]] with a black and red, lacey pushup bra being revealed, [[fishnet stockings]] and higheels to highlight her shapely physique. In her original design, she had black hair.

Voice by [[Nicole Sullivan]].

===Mahatma Gandhi===
'''Gandhi''' is the clone of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], the [[India]]n activist of the [[Indian Revolution]]. Gandhi is a hyperactive, funny, talkative, immature and rather mischievous teenager who wants to be accepted by those around him.

The reason for his often-ridiculous behavior and underachieving in academics is because he thinks he cannot live up to the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi. Though he has a somewhat likable and friendly personality, his outrageous behavior tends to offend and annoy others. He is a close friend of Abe and at times a confidant to Joan when he is not annoying her. Gandhi knows Joan likes Abe but does not say anything for Joan's privacy.

Gandhi believes he is a friend of the popular students and he especially wants to be best friends with JFK in order to be popular by association. He and JFK had three episodes in which they interacted, JFK admitted that he liked Gandhi as a friend in the episode ''Makeover, Makeover, Makeover''. Gandhi also erroneously believes himself to be a ladies man though no females are attracted to him except for Marie Curie but he did gain the attraction of several ladies when he briefly got a makeover as "GFK". In the series finale, Gandhi realizes his feelings for Marie and they begin a platonic relationship.

It is revealed that he used to be Cleo's foster brother for 10 years until she told her parents that he was hurting her image so he was disowned and later placed in the care of new foster parents, a stereotypical Jewish couple (despite the fact that Gandhi donated his kidney to Cleo when she was in terrible pain, something she seems to ignore). He is 16 years old. He is also very short for his age much to his own dismay (even having to use a [[booster seat]] when riding in a car). His favorite movie is ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' and according to the 2003 MTV website, he is the associate editor of the school newspaper ''The Tatler'' in which he reviews movies.&lt;ref name="[[Indian Express]]"&gt;{{cite news | last= O'Brien | first= Irene | title = Now MTV clones Gandhi, chips away at Mahatma | date=2003-01-29 |publisher=Indian Express | url=http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/17449/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi is called by various nicknames notably "[[G-spot]]" and "[[G-force]]". He also is school's mascot DNA Dan and the treasurer for the Solid Gandhi Dancers.

Gandhi appearance consist of a gray short-sleeved shirt with a red stripe, blue jeans and white and red sneakers. He stands very short, is very skinny (almost to the point of looking [[emaciated]]) and has dark, swarthy skin. He is bald, wears glasses and has a black mustache and beard. He also wears a gold earring on his right ear.

His portrayal as a party animal enraged many in [[India]], including prominent members of [[Parliament of India|India's parliament]].&lt;ref name="Grossberg"&gt;{{cite news|first=Josh |last=Grossberg |title=MTV Apologizes for Gandhi Goofing |date=2003-01-31 |publisher=E!

===Cleopatra Smith===
'''Cleopatra Smith''' is the clone of [[Cleopatra VII]], the last [[Pharaoh]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Cleopatra or "Cleo" is a beautiful, intelligent and popular student who is more commonly known as Abe's initial love interest.

She is a very selfish, [[snobbery|snobby]], cynical, vain, manipulative, pretentious and [[materialistic]] stereotypical [[school diva]] who cares only about her social image, beauty and popularity. She shows very little consideration for other people's feelings and believes she deserves to be treated like a queen among her peers. She is also an overachiever who frequently covets success in order to fit into her "[[queen bee (subculture)|queen bee]]" status. It is shown that she acts the way she does out of intense insecurity, and because she has an abusive foster mother who openly harbors contempt towards Cleo. She used to date JFK, but only because she thought he was good for her image.

She became Abe's girlfriend since the episode ''Plane Crazy''. Cleo is portrayed as [[seductive]], hedonistic and libidinous, as result she is sexually [[promiscuous]] and hates it when people make of fun of it, especially when Joan does it to spite her. Cleo has always been aware that Joan harbors strong feelings for Abe, and will often warn Joan to stay away from him after she and Abe began dating. When she discovered JFK's feelings for Joan, Cleo encouraged him to pursue her. In the Series Finale, when Abe was about to have sex with Cleo after prom, he begins to realize his feelings for Joan. After seeing how Cleo had been mistreating both her and Gandhi, Abe ends his relationship to her and leaves.

Despite her arrogance and mean-spirited nature she shows a limited ability of compassion as she willingly gave Joan a makeover to help boost her confidence, she gave up some of her vanity to date the obviously unpopular student Abe Lincoln and consoled JFK when he was sad about Poncey's death.

She is 16 years old. She is captain of the cheerleading team and is the Campus Life editor for ''The Tatler'' in which she interviews students and guest stars. Her physical appearance is derived from the wall paintings of Ancient Egyptian women. She is portrayed as being a tan [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]] girl which contradicts with the fact the real Cleopatra was of [[Macedonian people|Macedonian]] descent.

Cleo wears a blue (sometimes red or orange depending on her outfit) headband, a white tank top which shows her large cleavage and a tight black miniskirt to show her volumptuous figure and wears pumps. At night she sleeps in sexy purple [[lingerie]] and is sometimes seen in her cheerleading uniform at school. At the prom she wore a tight, revealing and seductive red dress and a black minidress at Poncey's funeral.

Voice by actress [[Christa Miller]], the wife of Clone High producer [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]].

===John F. Kennedy (JFK)===

'''JFK''' is the clone of [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]], the 35th President of the United States. JFK is the stereotypical popular high school [[jock (athlete)|jock]]. He is arrogant, competitive, lecherous, vain and at times dimwitted. He initially antagonized Abe and Gandhi but he later befriends them by the end of the series. However, JFK and Abe maintained a bitter rivalry, mainly due to them wanting to win over Cleopatra over in the early episodes. This later changed when JFK realizes that he is in love with Joan and despises the way Abe callously treats her by ignoring her feelings for him.

It is shown in episodes ''Episode Two: Election Blue-galoo'' and in ''Raisin the Stakes'', that JFK is a very [[charisma|good speaker]]. He speaks with a thick, stereotypical, non-rhotic [[New England English|New England]] dialect and a [[Boston accent]] (a parody of the Kennedy accent) that is exaggerated and monotone for a comical effect (he usually switches "-er" suffix with "-ah" and also uses "er" and "uh" as [[filler (linguistics)|filler]] which occur during mid-sentence). Despite his apparent [[machismo|macho]] exterior he is very sensitive, emotional and easily offended. JFK is known for his [[narcissism]] and his [[libido]]. He also has a penchant for using [[toilet humor|dirty jokes]] and [[innuendo]]. Despite this, JFK has been known to be very compassionate towards others.

Despite being accident-prone, a target of physical harm and losing his best friend Poncey to a freak accident: he does not believe in the [[Kennedy curse]] - "Nothing bad ever happens to the [[Kennedys]]" and "I'm a Kennedy, I'm not accustomed to tragedy". His plan of living up to John F. Kennedy is simply by being a womanizer and he is shown to be attractive to women, he seems not to know much about his clonefather besides that he [[Apollo program|conquered the moon]]. It is shown that he likes Joan, which is possibly because she is one of the few girls that is immune to his charm. Another reason why JFK likes her is because she is more compassionate and has always seen more to her than Abe did. In the Series Finale, he comforts Joan and takes her to the prom with his other prom dates. However, they leave him when they realize JFK and Joan are in love with each other. It is at prom and later at Joan's home that they begin a relationship, much to Abe's detest.

He is 16 years old. He mainly drives a yellow van but in the episode ''Sleep of Faith'' drove a 1950s-esque [[Chevrolet Corvette|corvette]] which was destroyed. He also seems to have a fear of sudden movements and friendly "hand gun" gestures as he constantly ducks, probably as a cruel joke about the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]]. He questioned his sexuality when he became attracted to "John Dark" (Joan in [[crossdressing|drag]]). He is the captain of the football team and soccer team. When he gets hit by Joan, he yells out "Bobby!", a reference to [[Robert F. Kennedy]].

JFK is seen wearing a red sweater with a white stripe in the center and on his sleeves, over a white shirt and tight khaki pants with brown [[loafers]]. He has tall, full brown hair and has a fit and muscular [[physical attractiveness|physique]]. His eyes are usually half-open but will get bigger whenever he is shocked, angered or upset. He appears as very healthy even though the real John F. Kennedy suffered a variety of sicknesses from birth (including [[Addison's disease]]).

Voice by [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller|Christopher Miller.]] Miller had to study the speeches of John F. Kennedy in order to perfect the voice and the accent.

===Principal Scudworth===

'''Principal Cinnamon J. Scudworth, Ph.D.''' is a deluded, self-aggrandizing megalomaniac of a scientist who always wears rubber dish-gloves and if absolutely horrible at being a principal, he is always trying to betray the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures and use the clones for his own convoluted schemes, his favorite being a clone themed [[amusement park]].

He is shown to have very little control over his emotions and is prone to violent outbursts. It's possible he is an atheist because he once said "so, religion is for fools?...fools and liberals". As seen in the opening theme, there is a photo of him and Mr. Butlertron salvaging the remains of Abraham Lincoln, which implies that he was the one along with Mr. B who had dug the corpses of the people in the mid-1980s who would later be used in the cloning experiment.

Scudworth apparently had a son named "Brian Parker Scudworth" who he bet in a basketball game against the principal of GESH and lost, as a result Brian ended up getting eaten.&lt;ref name="The Tatler"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tatler Issue #6 |date=2003-08-13 |publisher=CloneHighUSA.com |url=http://clonehighusa.com/backstage/tatler/tatler%20issue%206/tatler_issue_six_scud.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031223090525/http://clonehighusa.com/backstage/tatler/tatler%20issue%206/tatler_issue_six_scud.html |archivedate=December 23, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is seen wearing glasses, a long white lab coat, yellow rubber gloves (which he never takes off), underneath his coat are black pants and shoes. He has brown hair with a bald spot and a small [[soul patch]] under his lower lip.

Voice by Phil Lord.

===Mr. Lynn Butlertron===
'''Mr. Lynn Butlertron''' is the loyal robot servant and best friend/roommate to Scudworth who is programmed with a highly sensitive compassion protocol (a parody of [[Mr. Belvedere]]). Also known as Mr. B. He calls everyone "Wesley", a reference to the youngest son on Mr. Belvedere, Wesley Owens. Strangely, even though he is a robot, Mr. Butlertron is shown without his mustache in a photograph taken in the 80s in the opening to the show and he also has chest hair and armpit hair as shown when he took off his red cardigan sweater vest. Though he is usually polite and laid-back, he does have a temper which came out when had a fight with Scangrade and when he showed jealousy towards Ecybo Pooch.

Mr. Butlertron is very human-like being programmed to be highly [[sentient]] (though its unknown on how he can feel [[physical sensations]]) and possesses [[artificial intelligence]] that which enables him to show human emotions, have [[free will]] and have facial expressions. He genuinely cares for Scudworth and the students.

Voice by Christopher Miller.

===The Shadowy Figure===
'''The Secret Board of Shadowy Figures''' is a ruthless and secretive government organization who employs Principal Scudworth and is sponsored by [[Puma AG|Puma]]. They appear as a parody of the [[CIA]], [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], [[NSA]] and [[Area 51]]. They were responsible for the creation of the clones in the mid-80's. Their ultimate aim is to use the clones for a super army. The organization consists primarily of aged [[white people|white]] male agents.

Its chief director is referred to as '''The Shadowy Figure''' (voiced by [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]]). He is aware of Scudworth's craziness and incompetence in running Clone High. Though for the most part, he has shown amnesty as he gave Scudworth numerous times to redeem himself. He finally decides to kill Scudworth and takes the clones away for experimentation after discovering his video tape of his plot to betray the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures and create "Cloney Island". He also secretly hired many celebrities to spy on the clones and Scudworth. He may be [[lactose intolerant]].

They all wear blue [[paramilitary]] uniforms complete with ribbon bars and in the ''Episode Two'' they are seen wearing [[Puma AG|Pumas]] sneakers.

==Supporting characters==

===Clone High students===

* '''[[Julius Caesar]]''': Caesar is a good friend of JFK. He is shown to be one of the popular students at Clone High and is very friendly. He speaks in a very old aristocratic and theatrical manner. From one of the quotes on the 2003 MTV website he implies that he is in a relationship with Catherine: "By my troth, Catherine the Great, thou hast playéd with mine heart of stone, and yay, I hath returned but not my pyre" and the two are often seen together. He is also a fan of [[Laurence Olivier]]. He always wears a [[laurel wreath]] on his head. He appears to have an indifferent personality as shown in ''Litter Kills Literally'' as he nonchalantly ate popcorn at Poncey's funeral and did not appear to mourn about his death like the other characters nor did he get shocked after JFK had a mental breakdown at the funeral, instead he appeared to be entertained. His catchphraise was originally to be "[[veni, vidi, vici|Veni, vidi, booyah]]!". He is voiced by [[Neil Flynn]].
* '''[[Catherine the Great]]''': a blonde classmate who speaks with a [[Valley girl]] dialect. She is best friends with Cleopatra and is one of the popular students. She is implied to be in a relationship with Julius Caesar as they are often together. She has had sex with JFK in which he insults her as "Catherine the so-so". She is shown as being vain, promiscuous and somewhat stupid. She had pursued Gandhi when he was "GFK" (Gandhi with a JFK makeover) but lost interest after he returned to his normal self and went to Winter Prom with JFK alongside The Brontë Sisters and Joan of Arc. In the Series Finale, Catherine and the Brontë Sisters discovers JFK's feelings for Joan and leave them. She is voiced by [[Murray Miller]].
* '''[[Genghis Khan]]''': a friend of Abe and Gandhi. He appears as very friendly but [[mental retardation|mentally challenged]] as he is unable to carry out simple tasks that have been instructed upon him. He is also overweight, gluttonous and has a [[Amblyopia|lazy eye]]. However, he is a skilled opera singer as shown when he sang ''[[Ave Maria]]'' at Poncey's funeral. He also wears an orange shirt with the line "Screw Tibet!" and a newspaper hat on his head. In his original character design, Genghis was shown as being somewhat of a video game nerd. He is voiced by [[Phil Lord]].
* '''[[Marie Antoinette]]''': a physically attractive waitress at the [[Grassy Knoll]]. She is also another one of popular students. She has large breasts which are the source of JFK and Gandhi's boob jokes which she appears to be annoyed by in ''A Room for One's Clone''. She speaks with a French accent despite the fact her clone-mother was Austrian. Her head got chopped off by Winston Churchill's helicopter in ''Makeover'' and she is seen carrying her head in her arms at the end of the episode ''Changes'' (but strangely enough she was previously seen with it attached to her neck when she was conversing with Tom Green in the background). She is voiced by [[Sarah Chalke]].
* '''[[George Washington Carver]]''': a science geek who is obsessed with experimenting with peanuts. He created Peanie, an anthropomorphic peanut. He and Gandhi make a [[blaxploitation]]-style film called ''Black and Tan'' in the episode ''Film Fest''. He is voiced by [[Donald Faison]].
* '''[[Jesus Christ|Jesús Cristo]]''': a [[Latino]] version of Jesus Christ. He is often seen in woodshop class, which is an allusion to the real Jesus' career as a [[carpenter]]. He was used as a confidant to Joan in ''A.D.D.: The Last 'D' is for Disorder''. He wears a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] on his head. He also appears to be a [[stoner (cannabis)|stoner]]. His voice is provided by [[Jeff Garcia (voice actor)|Jeff Garcia]].
* '''[[Adolf Hitler]]''': Appears in one scene in the episode "Film Fest: Tears of a Clone". He appears to have a peace sign on his armband instead of a [[swastika]].
* '''[[Vincent van Gogh]]''': a mentally disturbed and anti-social young man. He is missing his ear and covers the exposed area with a bandage. He may represent the [[emo (subculture)|emo]] kid. His room is modeled after the [[impressionist]] paintings of Van Gogh. Like his clone-father he is a very talented artist as shown when he painted a giant mural to get back at Gandhi. He is voiced by [[Andy Dick]].
* '''[[Marie Curie]]''': a clone who was morbidly deformed due to the exposure to radiation that was in her clone-mother's DNA. She has a very sweet, innocent and nice personality and is very active at school. She is the president of the Solid Gandhi Dancers. She has a major crush on Gandhi as revealed in the episode ''Makeover, Makeover, Makeover''. Gandhi acknowledges his feelings for her at the episode of ''Makeover, Makeover, Makeover'' and they became a couple at the end of the episode ''Changes''. She is voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]].
* '''[[Thomas Edison]]''': He is one of the school nerds and runs the [[audiovisual]] club. He has a [[hunchback]] and the way he speaks makes him sound [[nasal congestion|congested]] and having a [[lisp]]. He is voiced by Andy Dick.
* '''[[Paul Revere]]''': the nosy school [[gossip]] who he is seen riding a horse while he spreads rumors, he played a major role in the episode ''A.D.D'', as he informed the whole school of Gandhi's condition. He is voiced by [[Zach Braff]].
* '''[[Nostradamus]]''': He is an overweight, pimply nerd who falsely believes that he can predict anything, he is known for saying he knew something was going to happen after it already did happen. Because of that he is often seen as a nuisance. He is a lover of science fiction and fantasy. He was also seen hanging with [[Marilyn Monroe]] at the Grassy Knoll.
* '''The [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] Twins''': one twin is fit and healthy which represents the younger Elvis during his prime in the 1950s and the other twin is overweight and gluttonous with an addiction to [[tranquilizers]] to represent Elvis during his downfall in the 1970s.
* '''[[Isaac Newton]]''': He was originally supposed to be a recurring character, but only appeared in cameos. He is a [[skateboarder]] with very long curly hair and wears a baseball cap that covers his eyes.
* '''[[Buddy Holly]]''': He plays in a band called ''[[flight recorder|Black Box]]'' along with [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[Ritchie Valens]] (who along with the real Holly, also died in plane crashes). He was originally supposed to a recurring character but only appeared in ''Plane Crazy'' in which he offers to let Abe ride in a poorly constructed [[biplane]] held together by duct tape along with Vaughan, Valens and half of ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]''. He is voiced by Neil Flynn.
* '''[[Sigmund Freud]]''': He seems able to read people's subconsciences. He appears in ''Film Fest'' in which he is the only one who is able to see Joan's love for Abe in her film entry albeit he mocks her for it. According to an article JFK wrote for the school newspaper ''The Tatler'', he tells JFK that he was repressed because he had two father figures and no mother to subconsciously lust after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tatler issue #3 |url=http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/tatler/tatler%20issue%203/tatler_issue_three_jfk1.html |publisher=CloneHighUSA.com |accessdate=2011-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528053308/http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/tatler/tatler%20issue%203/tatler_issue_three_jfk1.html |archivedate=May 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Napoleon Bonaparte]]''': Member of Clone High Basketball Team and an assistant manager at T.G.I. Chili's [[Chain store#Restaurant chains|restaurant chain]] when Abe and Gandhi get after-school jobs. Abe notes that he has [[Napoleon complex|somekind of complex]].
* '''[[Juan Ponce de León|Ponce de León]]''': referred to as "Poncey" is a combined parody of [[Fonzie]], [[Dylan McKay]] and [[James Dean]]. He only appears in the episode ''Litter Kills Literally'' alive but makes a cameo in the series finale as a ghost. He was JFK's best friend until they got into an argument. He was violently killed by a freak accident involving litter, where a juice box stabs him in the throat and a plastic bag gets caught on his head, causing him to drown in his own blood. (The juice box may be an allusion to the real Ponce de León's death, who died of a [[poison dart]].) He was very popular and well liked by the other students and he also appeared as optimistic and philosophical which JFK mocked about him. He makes another appearance in that episode as ghost but was likely that was only a hallucination conceived by the grief-stricken JFK. He was voiced by [[Luke Perry]].

===Clone High staff===

* '''[[Eleanor Roosevelt]]''': The school's gym teacher. She appears as grotesque and aggressive. She also implies she is a lesbian as she ogled at Joan in the episode ''Escape from Beer Mountain''.
* '''Mr. Sheepman''': A kindly history teacher at Clone High, home room teacher for the clones, and the first mostly human clone with a little sheep DNA mixed into his genetic composition (a parody of [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the Sheep]]). His mannerisms are a parody of [[Don Knotts]]. Voice by [[Andy Dick]].

===Family===

* '''Abe's Foster Dad''' and '''Abe's Foster Mom''': They represent a typical conservative suburban couple. They are seen in ''Raisin the Stakes'' where they reprimand Abe for smoking raisins and Abe's father is seen in the episode ''Changes'' which he encourages Abe to have sex with Cleopatra. Abe's father resembles Harold Weir from the TV series [[Freaks and Geeks]]. Abe's Foster Dad is voiced by [[Joe Flaherty]] and Abe's Foster Mom is voiced by Will Forte.
* '''Toots''': Joan's adoptive grandfather. He is a blind, elderly, likely senile African-American [[jazz]] musician who resembles [[Ray Charles]]. He is seen with a [[clarinet]] most of the time. He has a very down-to-earth personality. He is loving and patient towards his foster granddaughter and gives her advice all the time but he fails to understand why she is so upset. He possible is a devout Christian as he has a golden [[Jesus Fish]] on the trunk of his car. He is in a relationship with Cleo's alcoholic mother. He is voiced by [[Donald Faison]].
* '''Wally and Carl''': JFK's adoptive fathers who he refers to as "Gay Foster Dads". They are a flamboyant, gay, interracial couple who are loving and understanding towards their adopted son despite his mild [[homophobia]]. JFK shows low tolerance for them and stresses himself to act as masculine and promiscuous as possible to compensate for their homosexuality. Wally is the African-American effeminate partner and Carl is the Caucasian [[butch and femme|butch]] partner. They are voiced by [[Donald Faison]] and [[Neil Flynn]] respectively.
* '''Cleo's drunk foster mom''': Cleo's (and formerly Gandhi's) unnamed adoptive mother. She is a lazy, slurring [[alcoholic]] being unemployed and lives off disability checks. She tends to be abusive towards her daughter both physically and verbally. She once threw make-up at Cleo when she ran out of [[liquor]]. Her hostility towards Cleo is stemmed from her own jealously as Cleo is everything she is not, being young, popular and attractive. She is in a relationship with Toots and the two are into [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]] as it is seen in ''A Room For One's Clone''. It is likely her last name is Smith as that is Cleo's surname and it is said by Gandhi that she was married at one point because he said Cleo convinced her parents to disown him. She will proposition Abe at one point whenever he tries to visit or contact Cleo. She is voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]].
* '''Gandhi's parents''': Gandhi's adopted mother and father are a [[Jewish stereotypes|stereotypical]] [[Jewish]] couple. They want Gandhi to excel in school. Gandhi's Stereotypical Jewish Foster Dad is voiced by Neil Flynn.

===Other characters===

* '''Narrator''': the sarcastic narrator of the show, he tells the audience in the beginning what happened in the previous episode and a preview of the succeeding episode at the end of the show. He is voiced by [[Will Forte]] who also voices Abe.
* '''Scangrade ("The Magnificent")''': an egotistical and boastful robot who is Mr. Butlertron's hated nemesis. He is a giant dated computer grading machine but with arms and legs and a face. Unlike Mr. Butlertron, Scangrade is very primitive as he was manufactured in the 1950s (he has to be plugged into the wall just to operate). He appears in ''Sleep of Faith'' and though Mr. Butlertron destroyed him at the end of that episode, Scangrade appears in ''Changes'' in which he is covered with tape as a repair. He is powered by the PXJTs. He refers to everyone as "infidels". He is voiced by [[Judah Miller]].
* '''President Dog''': A cute, little stray [[puppy]] who is the student body president of Clone High. He randomly appears at the end of the ''Episode Two'' in the heat of the class election between Abe Lincoln and JFK, all the students immediately but unintentionally voted him as their class president because of his cuteness and Cleopatra even tried to [[bestiality|seduce him]]. Cleo somewhat takes ownership of him and she constantly dotes on him. He was one of the reasons why JFK and Cleo broke up as JFK was annoyed by Cleo putting herself and the dog before him.
* '''Cop''': a police officer who makes random appearances in the series notably in episodes ''Escape from Beer Mountain'', ''Sleep of Faith'', ''Film Fest'' and ''Litter Kills Literally''. He is voiced by [[Andy Dick]].
* '''Peanie''': an anthropomorphic peanut with a monocle, eyes, arms and legs. He was created by George Washington Carver. He is kept in a jar and has a fear of being turned into peanut butter. He has appeared in episodes: ''Escape from Beer Mountain'' and ''Film Fest''. He is a parody of [[Mr. Peanut]].
* '''Geshy''': a strange, colorful and [[carnivorous]] creature that was introduced in the episode ''Shot in the D'arc''. He is the mascot for GESH (Genetically Engineered Superhuman High) and is kidnapped by Gandhi and Genghis to gain revenge on GESH. It is revealed that he is a real creature and he and Gandhi form a friendship similar to [[E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial|Elliot and E.T.]]. After Gandhi gives him up it is shown he has an insatiable appetite for flesh and begins eating wild animals and bit off the referee's arm. He makes a cameo appearance in ''Litter Kills Literally'' hidden among a group of animals that JFK calls to clean up litter.
* '''Glenn the Janitor''': Is the janitor who works at Clone High. He is also the adopted father of Ponce de León. His appearance is based on the [[Janitor (Scrubs)|Janitor]] from the TV series ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' (which is also produced by Bill Lawrence). In connection to ''Clone High'', in a [[Scrubs (season 8)|season 8]] episode of ''Scrubs'' it was revealed that the Janitor's real name was ''Glenn Matthews''. He is voiced by Neil Flynn, who was famous for playing the Janitor on ''Scrubs''.

==Reception==
''Clone High'' is praised for its high character development and strong voice acting. Charles Soloman of the [[LA Times]] wrote that, "Will Forte's ingenuous Abraham Lincoln and Nicole Sullivan's resigned Joan of Arc steal the show."&lt;ref name="Freshman animators"/&gt;

The following are [[sign languages]] reported to be spoken by at least 10,000 people.

Estimates for sign language use are very crude, and definitions of what counts as proficiency varied. For most sign languages we do not have even a crude estimate. For instance, there are reported to be a million signers in Ethiopia, but it is unknown which or how many sign languages they use.

The 2013 edition of [[Ethnologue]] lists 137 sign languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Below is a '''list of siteswaps''' or [[juggling pattern]]s by [[siteswap]].

Toss juggling requires more balls than hands.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite web|url=http://www.jugglingdb.com/faq/index.php?question=1 |title="1. What is juggling?", ''IJDb'' |accessdate=2016-11-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201042130/http://www.jugglingdb.com/faq/index.php?question=1 |archivedate=December 1, 2008 |df= }}. Cited in Rosenberger, Phillip (2011). ''Juggling Basics, Why and How To''.&lt;!--unpaginated--&gt; {{ISBN|9780983339700}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus tricks such as the one ball cascade toss back and forth, 300,&lt;ref name="Examples"&gt;Darley, Vincent (1996). "[http://www.juggling.org/help/siteswap/examples.html Site Swaps: Examples]", ''Juggling.org''. Accessed: October 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, may not be considered valid patterns. Throws back and forth shower style, odd numbers, are the most common one prop practice. Invalid or practice patterns and tricks are marked with an X.

The numbers are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20728493 Juggling by numbers: How notation revealed new tricks]", ''BBC.com'' (BBC article with explanatory video)&lt;/ref&gt;
*0 = "missing"/rest [empty hand]
*1 = pass [between hands]
*2 = hold [one hand/no toss]
*3 = (3-ball) cascade toss [between hands]
*4 = (4-ball) fountain or columns toss [up and into same hand]
*5 = high toss [between hands]
*...
*a = 10 = high columns/fountain toss
*...

Symbols:
{{Div col}}
*Number: Relative height of a toss. 1, 2, 3...
*Brackets []: Multiplex. [333]33.
*Chevrons and vertical bar &lt;|&gt;: Simultaneous and passing patterns.
**P: Pass. &lt;333P|333P&gt;
**Fraction: Pass 1/y beats later. &lt;4.5 3 3 | 3 4 3.5&gt;
*Parentheses (): Synchronous pattern.
** *: Synchronous pattern that switches sides. (4,2x)(2x,4) = (4,2x)*
**x: Toss to the other hand during a synchronous pattern.

A pattern is symmetrical (S) if both hands play the same role and asymmetrical (A) if not. All asynchronous patterns whose periods are odd are symmetrical, and all asynchronous patterns whose periods are even are asymmetrical.

'''topoi''', (from {{lang-grc|τόπος}} 'place,' elliptical for {{lang-grc|τόπος κοινός}} ''tópos koinós'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Commonplace|volume=6|page=779}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'common place'), in [[Latin language|Latin]] '''''locus''''' (from ''locus communis''), refers  to a method for developing arguments. (See [[Inventio#Topoi|''topoi'' in classical rhetoric]].)

==Meaning and history==
Topos is translated variously as "topic," "line of argument," or "commonplace." [[Ernst Robert Curtius]] studied topoi as "commonplaces," themes common to orators and writers who re-worked them according to occasion, e.g., in classical antiquity the observation that “all must die” was a topos in consolatory oratory, for in facing death the knowledge that death comes even to great men brings comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Robert Curtius, ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'', trans. from German by Willard R. Trask (New York, NY: Pantheon Books, 1953), 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Curtius also discussed the topoi in the invocation of nature (sky, seas, animals, etc.) for various rhetorical purposes, such as witnessing to an oath, rejoicing or praising God, or mourning with the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Curtius, ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'', 92–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Culture''' ({{lang-bg|Министерство на културата}}, ''Ministerstvo na kulturata'') of [[Bulgaria]] is the [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] charged with overseeing and stimulating the cultural work in the country and preserving its cultural heritage. It first existed as a separate institution in 1954-1957, previously being part of the Ministry of Enlightenment and then active under various names until promoted back to a ministry in 1990 (but once again briefly united with the [[Ministry of Education and Science (Bulgaria)|Ministry of Education and Science]] in 1993).

The current minister is Boil Banov.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2980">The '''Ninety-Two Resolutions''' were drafted by [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] and other members of the ''[[Parti canadien|Parti patriote]]'' of [[Lower Canada]] in 1834. The resolutions were a long series of demands for political reforms in the [[United Kingdom|British]]-governed colony.

Papineau had been elected speaker of the legislative assembly of [[Lower Canada]] in 1815. His party constantly opposed the unelected colonial government, and in 1828 he helped draft an early form of the resolutions, essentially a list of grievances against the colonial administration. To ensure that the views of the Legislative Assembly be understood by the [[British House of Commons]], the ''Parti patriote'' had sent its own delegation to London in order to submit a memoir and a petition signed by 87,000 people.

On February 28, 1834, Papineau presented the Ninety-Two Resolutions to the Legislative Assembly which were approved and sent to [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/92-resolutions/&lt;/ref&gt;. The resolutions included, among other things, demands for an elected Legislative Council and an Executive Council responsible before the house of representatives. Under the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]], the government of Lower Canada was given an elected legislative assembly, but members of the upper houses were appointed by the Governor of the colony. 

In the resolutions, the elected representatives once again reiterated their loyalty to the British Crown, but expressed frustration that the government of London had been unwilling to correct the injustices caused by the past governments of the colony.

Papineau's resolutions were ignored for almost three years; meanwhile, the Legislative Assembly did all it could to oppose the un-elected upper houses while avoiding outright rebellion. [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|British Colonial Secretary]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]] eventually responded to them by issuing ten resolutions of his own (the [[Russell Resolutions]]). All of the Legislative Assembly's demands were rejected. {{wikisource|The Ninety-Two Resolutions of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada|The Ninety-Two Resolutions}}

The ten resolutions reached Canada in 1837, and many of Papineau's reformists began to agitate for a rebellion. See the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]].

A '''nonchord tone''' ('''NCT'''), '''nonharmonic tone''', or '''embellishing tone''' is a [[Musical note|note]] in a piece of [[music]] or [[song]] that is not part of the implied or expressed [[chord (music)|chord]] set out by the [[harmony|harmonic]] framework. In contrast, a '''chord tone''' is a note that is a part of the [[diatonic function|functional]] chord (see: [[factor (chord)]]). Nonchord tones are most often discussed in the context of the [[common practice period]] of [[classical music]], but they can be used in the analysis of other types of [[tonality|tonal music]] as well, such as Western [[popular music]].

Nonchord tones are often categorized as ''accented nonchord tones'' and ''unaccented nonchord tones'' depending on whether the dissonance occurs on an accented or unaccented [[Beat (music)|beat]] (or part of a beat).

Over time, some musical styles assimilated chord types outside of the common-practice style. In these chords, tones that might normally be considered nonchord tones are viewed as chord tones, such as the seventh of a [[minor seventh chord]]. For example, in 1940s-era [[bebop jazz]], playing an F{{music|#}} with a C{{music|7 chord}} chord, woud be considered a chord tones if the chord were analyzed as C&lt;sup&gt;7({{music|#}}11)&lt;/sup&gt;. In European classical music, "[t]he greater use of dissonance from period to period as a result of the dialectic of linear/vertical forces led to gradual normalization of [[Ninth chord|ninth]], [[Eleventh chord|eleventh]], and [[Thirteenth chord|thirteenth chords]] [in analysis and theory]; each additional non-chord tone above the foundational triad became frozen into the chordal mass."&lt;ref&gt;"Debussy and the Crisis of Tonality", p.72. Author(s): Roland Nadeau. Source: Music Educators Journal, Vol. 66, No. 1, (Sep., 1979), pp. 69-73. Published by: MENC: The National Association for Music Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mel Bay Creative Keyboard's Deluxe Encyclopedia of Piano Chords: A Complete Study of Chords and How to Use Them'', p.8. {{ISBN|978-0-87166-579-9}}. Emphasis original.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also defined by the time at which they sound: "''Nonharmonic tones'' are pitches that sound along with a chord but are not chord pitches."&lt;ref name="Benward &amp; Saker"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I, p.92. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if an excerpt from a piece of music implies or uses a C-major chord, then the notes C, E and G are members of that chord, while any other note played at that time (e.g., notes such as F{{music|#}}) is a nonchord tone. Such tones are most obvious in [[homophony|homophonic]] music but occur at least as frequently in [[counterpoint|contrapuntal music]].

According to ''Music in Theory and Practice,'' "Most nonharmonic tones are [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] and create [[interval (music)|intervals]] of a second, fourth or seventh",&lt;ref name="Benward &amp; Saker"/&gt; which are required to [[resolution (music)|resolve]] to a chord tone in conventional ways. If the note fails to resolve until the next change of harmony, it may instead create a [[seventh chord]] or [[extended chord]]. While theoretically in a three-note chord, there are nine possible nonchord tones in [[equal temperament]], in practice nonchord tones are usually in the prevailing [[key (music)|key]]. Augmented and diminished intervals are also considered dissonant, and all nonharmonic tones are measured from the [[bass note]], or lowest note sounding in the chord except in the case of nonharmonic bass tones.&lt;ref name="Benward &amp; Saker"/&gt;

Nonharmonic tones generally occur in a pattern of three pitches, of which the nonharmonic tone is the center:&lt;ref name="Benward &amp; Saker"/&gt;
:{| style="text-align: center;"
|-
| Chord tone  || – || Nonchord tone || – || Chord tone
|-
|[[Preparation (music)|Preparation]]|| – ||[[Consonance and dissonance|Dissonance]]|| – ||[[Resolution (music)|Resolution]]
|-
|}

Nonchord tones are categorized by how they are used. The most important distinction is whether they occur on a strong or weak [[beat (music)|beat]] and are thus either accented or unaccented nonchord tones.&lt;ref name="Benward &amp; Saker"/&gt; They are also distinguished by their direction of approach and departure and the voice or voices in which they occur and the number of notes they contain.

==Unaccented==
===Anticipation===&lt;!--[[Anticipation (music)]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
An ''anticipation'' (ANT) occurs when this note is approached by [[Step (music)|step]] and then remains the same. It is basically a note of the second chord played early. In the example below, the dissonant B in bar 1 is approached by step and resolves when that same pitch becomes a chord tone in bar 2.

:&lt;score vorbis="1" lang="lilypond"&gt;
   \new PianoStaff &lt;&lt;
      \new Staff &lt;&lt;
         \new Voice \relative c'' {
             \stemUp \clef treble \key c \major \time 4/4
             c4 \once \override NoteHead.color = #red b b2
             }
         \new Voice \relative c' {
             \stemDown
              e2 d
              }
            &gt;&gt;
     \new Staff &lt;&lt;
         \new Voice \relative c {

             }
         &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

A ''[[portamento]]'' is the late Renaissance precursor to the [[#Anticipation|anticipation]],&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2009). ''Music in Theory and Practice'', Vol. II, p.8. {{ISBN|978-0-07-310188-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though today it refers to a [[glissando]].

:&lt;score vorbis="1" lang="lilypond" override_midi="Portamento.mid"&gt;
   \new PianoStaff &lt;&lt;
      \new Staff &lt;&lt;
         \relative c'' {

             \partial2 d2~ d c4 d e f g e
             }
            &gt;&gt;
     \new Staff &lt;&lt;

             }
         &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

=== Neighbor tone&lt;!--[[Neighbor note]] and [[neighbor tone]] redirect directly here.--&gt; ===
A ''neighbor tone'' (NT) or ''auxiliary note'' (AUX) is a nonchord tone that passes stepwise from a chord tone directly above or below it (which frequently causes the NT to create dissonance with the chord) and resolves to the same chord tone:

:&lt;score vorbis="1" lang="lilypond"&gt;
   \new PianoStaff &lt;&lt;
      \new Staff &lt;&lt;
         \new Voice \relative c'' {
             \clef treble \key c \major \time 4/4
             \stemUp c4 \once \override NoteHead.color = #red d c2
             }
         \new Voice \relative c' {
             \stemDown e2 e
              }
            &gt;&gt;
     \new Staff &lt;&lt;
         \relative c {
             \clef bass \key c \major \time 4/4
             &lt;c g'&gt;2 &lt;c g'&gt; \bar "||"
             }
         &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

In practice and analysis, neighboring tones are sometimes differentiated depending upon whether or not they are lower or higher than the chord tones surrounding them. A neighboring tone that is a step higher than the surrounding chord tones is called an ''upper neighboring tone'' or an ''upper auxiliary note'' while a neighboring tone that is a step lower than the surrounding chord tones is a ''lower neighboring tone'' or ''lower auxiliary note''. However, following [[Heinrich Schenker]]'s usage in ''[[Free Composition]]'', some authors reserve the term "neighbor note" to the lower neighbor a [[half step]] below the main note.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Non-harmonic note|author=William Drabkin|access-date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German term ''Nebennote'' is a somewhat broader category, including all nonchord tones approached from the main note by step.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

===Escape tone===
An ''escape tone'' (ET) or ''echappée'' is a particular type of unaccented incomplete neighbor tone that is approached stepwise from a chord tone and resolved by a skip in the opposite direction back to the harmony.

:&lt;score vorbis="1" lang="lilypond"&gt;
   \new PianoStaff &lt;&lt;
      \new Staff &lt;&lt;
         \new Voice \relative c'' {
             \stemUp \clef treble \key c \major \time 4/4
             c4 \once \override NoteHead.color = #red d b2
             }
         \new Voice \relative c' {
             \stemDown
              e2 d
              }
            &gt;&gt;
     \new Staff &lt;&lt;
         \new Voice \relative c {
             \clef bass \key c \major \time 4/4
             &lt;c g'&gt;2 g' \bar "||"
             }
         &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

===Passing tone===
A ''passing tone'' (PT) or ''passing note'' is a nonchord tone prepared by a chord tone a step above or below it and resolved by continuing in the same direction stepwise to the next chord tone (which is either part of the same chord or of the next chord in the harmonic progression).

:&lt;score vorbis="1" lang="lilypond"&gt;
   \new PianoStaff &lt;&lt;
      \new Staff &lt;&lt;
         \new Voice \relative c'' {
             \clef treble \key c \major \time 4/4
             \stemUp c4 \once \override NoteHead.color = #red d e2
             }
         \new Voice \relative c' {
             \stemDown e2 e
              }
            &gt;&gt;
     \new Staff &lt;&lt;
         \relative c {
             \clef bass \key c \major \time 4/4
             &lt;c g'&gt;2 &lt;c g'&gt; \bar "||"
             }
         &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

Where two nonchord tones are before the resolution they are ''double passing tones'' or ''double passing notes''.

==Accented==

===Passing tone===
As with above but on an accented beat.

:&lt;score vorbis="1" lang="lilypond"&gt;
   \new PianoStaff &lt;&lt;
      \new Staff &lt;&lt;
         \new Voice \relative c'' {
             \clef treble \key c \major \time 4/4
             \stemUp g1 \once \override NoteHead.color = #red f2 e
             }
         \new Voice \relative c' {
             \stemDown e1 c
              }
            &gt;&gt;
     \new Staff &lt;&lt;
         \relative c {
             \clef bass \key c \major \time 4/4
             &lt;c g'&gt;1 &lt;c g'&gt; \bar "||"
             }
         &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

===Neighbor tone===
A neighbor tone where you step up or down from the chord tone, and then move back to the chord tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/53|title=Nonharmonic Tones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Endeavor, moreover, to introduce suspensions now in this voice, now in that, for it is incredible how much grace the melody acquires by this means. And every note which has a special function is rendered audible thereby.|[[Johann Joseph Fux]] (1725)&lt;ref&gt;Forte (1979), p.304.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}A ''suspension'' (SUS) (sometimes referred to as a ''syncope''&lt;ref name="Jonas96"&gt;Jonas (1982), p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;) occurs when the harmony shifts from one chord to another, but one or more notes of the first chord (the preparation) are either temporarily held over into or are played again against the second chord (against which they are nonchord tones called the ''suspension'') before resolving downwards to a chord tone by step (the resolution). The whole process is called a ''suspension'' as well as the specific nonchord tone(s).

Suspensions may be further described with two numbers: (1) the [[Interval (music)|interval]] between the suspended note and the [[bass note]] and (2) the interval between the resolution and the bass note. The most common suspensions are 4-3 suspension, 7-6 suspension, or 9-8 suspension. Note that except for the 9-8 suspensions, the numbers are typically referred to using the [[Simple interval|simple intervals]], so for instance, if intervals are actually an 11th and a 10th (the first example below), you would typically call it a ''4-3 suspension''. If the bass note is suspended, then the interval is calculated between the bass and the part that is most dissonant with it, often resulting in a 2-3 suspension.'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51613969|title=Tonal Harmony|last=Kostka|first=Stefan|last2=Payne|first2=Dorothy|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill|others=|year=|isbn=0072852607|edition=5th|location=Boston|pages=172|oclc=51613969}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

Suspensions must resolve downwards. If a tied note is prepared like a suspension but resolves upwards, it is called a ''retardation''. Common retardations include 2-3 and 7-8 retardations.

Decorated suspensions are common and consist of [[#Portamento|portamento]]s or double eighth notes, the second being a lower neighbor tone.

A chain of suspensions constitutes the fourth species of [[counterpoint]]; an example may be found in the second movement of [[Arcangelo Corelli]]'s [[Christmas Concerto (Corelli)|''Christmas Concerto'']].[[File:Corelli Xmas Concerto 2nd movement.png|thumb|center|500px|Corelli's ''Christmas Concerto'', 2nd movement.

===Appoggiatura===
An ''[[appoggiatura]]'' (APP) is a type of accented incomplete neighbor tone approached skip-wise from one chord tone and resolved stepwise to another chord tone ("overshooting" the chord tone).

==Involving more than three notes==

===Changing tones===
''[[Changing tones]]'' (CT) are two successive nonharmonic tones. A chord tone steps to a nonchord tone which skips to another nonchord tone which leads by step to a chord tone, often the same chord tone. They may imply neighboring tones with a missing or implied note in the middle. Also called ''double neighboring tones'' or ''neighbor group''.&lt;ref name="Benward &amp; Saker"/&gt;

:&lt;score vorbis="1" lang="lilypond"&gt;
   \new PianoStaff &lt;&lt;
      \new Staff &lt;&lt;
         \new Voice \relative c'' {
             \clef treble \key c \major \time 4/4
             \voiceOne c2 \override NoteHead.color = #red b4 d \override NoteHead.color = #black c1

             }
         &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

===Pedal point===
Another form of nonchord tone is a [[pedal point|''pedal point'']] or ''pedal tone'' (PD) or ''note'', almost always the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] or [[dominant (music)|dominant]], which is held through a series of chord changes. The pedal point is almost always in the lowest voice (the term originates from [[organ (music)|organ]] playing), but it may be in an upper voice; then it may be called an ''inverted pedal''. It may also be between the upper and lower voices, in which case it is called an ''internal pedal''.

             }
         &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

==Chromatic nonharmonic tone==
A ''chromatic nonharmonic tone'' is a nonharmonic tone that is [[diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]], or outside of the [[key (music)|key]] and creates [[semitone|half-step]] motion. The use of which, especially ''chromatic appoggiaturas'' and ''chromatic passing tones'', increased in the [[Romantic music|Romantic Period]].&lt;ref name="B&amp;S217"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2009), p.217-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The example below shows chromatic nonharmonic tones (in red) in the first four measures of [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s [[Preludes (Chopin)|Prelude No. 21, op. 28]].&lt;ref name="B&amp;S217" /&gt;

[[File:Poznań, Wszechsłowiański Zjazd Śpiewaczy 1929 - 03.jpg|thumb|The opening of the congress at the newly built [[Stadion Edmunda Szyca]]]]
[[File:Poznań, Wszechsłowiański Zjazd Śpiewaczy 1929 - 02.jpg|thumb|Czechoslovakian singers salute the President of Poland, [[Ignacy Mościcki]], during the military parade]]

The '''Panslavic Congress of Singers''' – the international assembly of the choirs and associations of singers which took place in [[Poznań]] within 18–21 of May 1929 during the commencing of the [[Polish General Exhibition]]. It was connected with the First Polish Music Festival (21–29 of May 1929).

The idea of the congress was initiated by the [[Greater Poland]]’s Singers Association and Slovak Singers’ Union under the conception of non-political binding of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] nations by dint of the culture. Choirs from various regions of [[Poland]] and [[Polish diaspora]], groups from [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Bulgaria]] have participated in it massively. Altogether over 17 000 singers have sung (other sources say about 18 000 or 20 000). 8 thousand men under leadership of professor [[Władysław Raczkowski]] sang the hymn [[Gaude Mater Polonia]]. The performance of Ojczyzna by [[Feliks Nowowiejski]] with his companionship of ten [[brass band]]s have caused the peculiar appealing of the audience. The number of people singing at once at the day of the opening is approximated to 12 000 or 13 000.

The souvenir after the Congress was the first ''Slavic Linden'' which was supposed to symbolise the unity and fraternity of the Slavic nations. It was planted by the participants on 21 May 1929 at 7 p.m. It was known to be located near the nearby opera, which now exists as the [[Henryk Wieniawski]] Park; Other sources say about [[Adam Mickiewicz]] Park. It was surrounded by 4 masts and every each had the banner of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Poland. It was intended to ultimately place it in the planned Slavic park. Around the linden, on the rails, there was a Polish inscription:

'''Slovakization''' or '''Slovakisation''' is a form of forced [[cultural assimilation]] process during which non-Slovak nationals give up their culture and language in favor of the Slovak one. This process has relied most heavily on intimidation and harassment by state authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Károly|last=Kocsis|first2=Eszter|last2=Kocsisné Hodosi|title=Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin|publisher=Simon Publications LLC|year=1998|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zZ_NVM9mNEC&amp;pg=PA62 |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=C.

The process itself is limited mostly to [[Slovakia]], where Slovaks constitute the absolute majority by means of population and legislation power as well. Slovakization is most often used in relation to [[Magyars|Hungarians]],&lt;ref name=R.content&gt;{{Harvnb|J. Rieber|2000| p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who constitute the most prominent minority of Slovakia, but it also affects [[Germans]], [[Poles]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Rusyns]] (Ruthenians),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magocsi|Pop|2002| p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jew]]s.

[[File:Magyarorszag 1920.png|thumb|right|300px|Map showing the border changes after the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. As a result, Hungary lost over two-thirds of its territory, about two-thirds of its inhabitants under the treaty and 3.3 million out of 10 million ethnic Hungarians.&lt;ref name="Macartney37"&gt;{{cite book| last=Macartney| first =C.A.|authorlink= | title=Hungary and her successors - The Treaty of Trianon and Its Consequences 1919-1937| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= East on the Danube: Hungary's Tragic Century|publisher=''The New York Times''| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E3D91531F93AA3575BC0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2|date=2003-08-09|accessdate=2008-03-15 | first=Richard | last=Bernstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Based on the 1910 census.)]]
The process of slovakization was present in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] presumably ever since the appearance of the Slovak nation itself, but up until the foundation of Czechoslovakia the process was entirely voluntary. This early form of slovakization can be observed in detail in noble families' personal correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=Meghasadt múlt - Fejezetek a szlovákok és a magyarok történelméből|language=Hungarian|publisher=Terra Recognita Alapítvány|title=Slovak-Hungarian common past: the medieval Slovak-Hungarian cohabitation and its memory in the two nations' thinking|first=Gábor|last=Lagzi|first2=István|last2=Kollai|year=2008|pages=30–41|url=http://www.kibic.hu/bin/archivprn.php?cid=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of pre-World War I Slovakization is the assimilation of the Habans, a [[Hutterite]] group settled in the [[Veľké Leváre|Nagylévárd]] (today's Veľké Leváre) area in the 16th century, into the Slovak majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://nemzetisegek.hu/repertorium/2007/05/belivek_13-16.pdf|page=5476|date=15 November 2007|title=Ceremonies related to death and burial in Slovakia|language=Hungarian|work=Barátság - kulturális és közéleti folyóirat|publisher=Filantróp Társaság Barátság Egyesülete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] concluded by the [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1920 set the southern border of Czechoslovakia for strategic and economic reasons much further south than the Slovak-Hungarian language border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Macartney|2001| p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, fully Hungarian-populated areas were annexed to the newly created state.&lt;ref name="gramma"&gt;[http://www.gramma.sk/en/hunginslov/history.php 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301110413/http://www.gramma.sk/en/hunginslov/history.php |date=1 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Czechoslovakia provided a large education network for the Hungarian minority. Hungarians, for example, had 31 kindergartens, 806 elementary schools, 46 secondary schools, 576 Hungarian libraries at schools in the 1930s and a Department of [[Hungarian literature]] was created at the [[Charles University of Prague]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The number of Hungarian elementary schools increased from 720 in 1923/1924 to the above number 806.&lt;ref name="marko"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marko|Martinický|1995| p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian University in Bratislava/Pozsony was immediately closed after formation of Czechoslovakia &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Engemann|2008| p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1910 census conducted by the Central Statistical Office of  Hungary, there were 884,309 people with Hungarian as a mother tongue, constituting 30.2% of the population, in what is now Slovakia{{verify source|date=June 2014}} compared to the 9.7% number recorded in the 2001 census, amounting to a 3 fold decrease in the percentage of Hungarians.&lt;ref name=CEP146&gt;{{Harvnb|C.M. Breuning|Dr. Lewis|Pritchard|2005| p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kocsis&gt;{{Harvnb|Kocsis|Kocsisné Hodosi|1998| p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Slovak census in 1919 in what is now Slovakia recorded 689,565 Hungarians constituting 23.59% of the population. According to the first Czechoslovak census in 1921 there were 650,597 Hungarians in Slovakia, constituting 21.68% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tisliar| p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Czechoslovak census of 1930 recorded 571,952 Hungarians. All censuses from the period are disputed, and some give conflicting data for example in Kosice according to the Czechoslovak censuses 15-20% of the population was Hungarian. However, during the parliamentary elections the Ethnic Hungarian parties got 35-45% of the total votes (excluding those Hungarians who voted for the Communists or the Social democrats).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kovács|2004| p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The whole matter is complicated by the fact that there was a high percentage of bilingual and similarly "Slovak-Hungarian" persons who could claim being both Slovak and Hungarian.

Slovak sources usually do not deny that many Hungarian teachers (replaced in Slovak schools by Slovak and Czech teachers), railwaymen (on strike against new Czechoslovak republic in February 1919),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zsr.sk/slovensky/historia-zeleznic/1918-1939.html?page_id=1276&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Citation is the railway company website (not scholar source), it does not contain single word about strike and it cannot be used to prove that "Slovak sources usually" do something or not.|date=June 2014}} postmen, policemen, soldiers and civil clerks (replaced by Czech and Slovak soldiers, policemen and clerks) were forced to leave or left for Hungary voluntarily, the numbers however are unclear but census do show a rapid decline in the number of people with Hungarian as a mother tongue. Some teachers and civil servants were expelled from Czechoslovakia while some left due to the harsh circumstances. There are many examples of Hungarians who were forced to leave their homes from this territory (two famous ones are the families of [[Béla Hamvas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamvasbela.org HamvasBéla.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]]). The high number of refugees (and even more from [[Romania]]) necessitated entire new housing projects in [[Budapest]] (Mária-Valéria telep, Pongrácz-telep), which gave shelter to refugees numbering at least in the ten-thousands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02185/html/228.html Magyarország a XX. században / Szociálpolitika&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It seemed to hit the city of [[Pressburg]] (soon to be renamed Bratislava) most intensely.  One of the very first measures brought by [[Samuel Zoch]], the newly appointed [[župan]] of the city was the forced disbandment of the only Hungarian university in Czechoslovakia ([[Elisabeth Science University]]), and the intimidation of its professors by the police in 1919, immediately after the formation of the new country.&lt;ref name="Zoch1"&gt;{{cite book

According to Varsik, the university was not closed by the župan because local politicians did not have such powers.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Elisabeth University was founded in 1912 and began teaching only in 1914. The university was not the only Hungarian graduate school in the territory of contemporary Slovakia, but it had to serve to also all students from [[Upper Hungary]] inhabited by Slovak majority. However, in compliance with the education policy of the Hungarian government, which did not allow Slovak high schools, the university did not even have a Slovak language department. In 1919, a new Czechoslovak university was founded in parallel and adopted space and limited inventory of unfinished faculty of medicine. Hungarian professors refused to promise loyalty to the new state, as was necessary for teachers and state employees, and were retired after being provided financial compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

On February 3, 1919, the day before the moving of [[Vavro Šrobár]]'s government to Bratislava, a strike began which affected key infrastructure and sectors of industry. The strike had initially social character.{{what|date=June 2018}} Thereafter, it was politicized and joined with national demands of Hungarian and German workers. On February 12, 1919, Hungarian nationalistic circles exploited a demonstration organized by the Council of Workers.

In comparison with the previous state in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] it also extended political rights to individuals of Hungarian nationality, by introducing [[universal suffrage]], removing voting criteria based on property size and benefits based on titles and functions or education (typical for previous Hungarian elections){{sfn|Zemko|Bystrický|2012|p=242}} and granted full [[women's suffrage]] (including for Hungarian women), which was not introduced in Hungary until 1945.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Later on, all minorities gained the right to use their languages in municipalities where they constituted at least 20% of the population even in communication with government offices and courts.

According to [[Béla Angyal]], due to [[gerrymandering]] and disproportionate distribution of population between [[Bohemia]] and [[Slovakia]] the Hungarians had little representation in the National Assembly and thus their influence on the politics of Czechoslovakia remained limited. The same considerations limited the Slovak [[intelligentsia]]'s political power as well.&lt;ref name="Zoch1_1" /&gt; On the other hand, Hungarians founded numerous parties including pro-Czechoslovak parties, founded parties with agrarian, social-democratic, Christian-socialist and other orientations, were active as sections of statewide Czechoslovak parties, had opportunities to participate in government and in the 1920s Hungarian members of parliament participated in adoption of several important laws with statewide impact.{{sfn|Simon|2009}}

After World War II, the size of Hungarian population was decreased by Czechoslovak-Hungarian population exchange and expulsion of Hungarians who came to after the [[First Vienna Award]] or committed crimes according to Decree of Slovak National Council No. 33/1945 Zb. about people tribunals. Due to the proclamation of the "Košice Government Program", the German and Hungarian population living in the reborn Czechoslovakia were subjected to various forms of persecution, including: expulsions, deportations, internments, peoples court procedures, citizenship revocations, property confiscation, condemnation to forced labour camps, and forced changes of ethnicity referred to as "reslovakization."

This monumental programme includes re−slovakization, already under way in whole Slovakia! Within the scope of this action everyone who feels to be Slovak by origin will have the chance to declare it freely whether they want to become Slovaks with all its consequences or want to share the fate of those without citizenship.“'' In the spring and summer of 1945, a series of decrees stripped Hungarians of property, from all civil rights and from their citizenship.&lt;ref name="Mandelbaum, p.40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mandelbaum|2000| p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungary itself gave the Slovaks equal rights and demanded the same solution to the issue from Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name=abcdef&gt;{{Harvnb|J.

[[File:Gutaiak.jpg|thumb|200px|Deported Hungarians of Gúta (Kolárovo) in Mladá Boleslav, Czechoslovakia, February, 1947 (photo: Dr. Károly Ravasz)]]	

The official results of re-slovakization action were summarized in the final report of the Re-slovakization Commission. The commission received 197,916 application forms related to 449,914 people. 83,739 applicants declared Slovak nationality also before 1930 and they were not considered to be re-slovakizants. From the remaining 366,175 candidates, the commission accepted 284,814 and refused 81,361 candidates for various reasons.{{sfn|Popély|2009|p=186}}

An important issue with the slovakization procedure was, that the "reslovakized" Hungarians did not take the forcible change of ethnicity seriously, because it is impossible to force someone to forget his culture and language suddenly. A Slovak journalist wrote the following about the "reslovaklized" city of [[Nové Zámky]] ({{lang-hu|Érsekújvár}}):&lt;ref&gt;Nás Národ, September 7, 1947. (Article by J. Miklo.)&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|''„80% of the Hungarian population of Nové Zamky re-Slovakized . . . On the other hand, the fact remains that one can barely hear Slovak spoken in Nové Zámky. You will never find these 80% Slovaks. Only a few government employees speak Slovak here and there. What happened to the re-Slovakized persons?“''|J. Miklo; Nás Národ (1947)}}

====After October 1948====
With the disappearance of [[Edvard Beneš]] from the political scene, the Czechoslovak government issued decree No. 76/1948 on April 13, 1948, allowing those Hungarians still living in Czechoslovakia, to reinstate Czechoslovak citizenship.&lt;ref name=Migration/&gt; A year later, Hungarians were allowed to send their children to Hungarian schools, which had been reopened for the first time since 1945,&lt;ref name=Migration/&gt; although Hungarians remaining in Slovakia were subjected to extremely heavy pressure to assimilate,&lt;ref name="Rieber, p. 93"/&gt; and complaints reached Moscow about forced enrollment of Hungarian children in Slovak schools.&lt;ref name="Rieber, p. 93"/&gt;

Most Slovakized Hungarians gradually readopted their Hungarian ethnicity. As a result, "The Re-Slovakization Commission" ceased operations in December 1948.

Despite their promises to settle the issue of the Hungarians in Slovakia, in 1948 Czech and Slovak ruling circles still maintained the hope that they could deport the Hungarians from Slovakia.&lt;ref name="Rieber, p. 92"/&gt; According to a 1948 poll conducted among the Slovak population 55% were for "resettlement" (deportation) of the Hungarians, 24% said "don't know", 21% were against.&lt;ref name="Rieber, p. 93"&gt;{{Harvnb|J. Rieber|2000| p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under slogans for the struggle with class enemies, the process of dispersing dense Hungarian settlements continued in 1948 and 1949.&lt;ref name="Rieber, p. 93"/&gt; By October 1949 preparations were made to deport 600 Hungarian families.&lt;ref name="Rieber, p. 93"/&gt;

Finally, on 25 July 1949, Czechoslovak and Hungarian delegations met in Štrbské pleso and signed so-called Štrba protocol ({{lang-sk|Štrbský protokol}}) which ended the law disputes between Hungarian and Czechoslovak property and legal question and compensation of deported Hungarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blisty.cz/art/19466.html|title = Štrbský protokol - "polozabudnutý" dokument|author = Vladimír Draxler|date = 24 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The current Slovak-Hungarian political standpoint on the expulsions====
In 2002 before [[Slovakia]] and Hungary [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|joined the European Union in 2004]], Hungarian politician [[Viktor Orbán]] demanded the repeal of the [[Beneš decrees]], but the [[European Parliament]] asserted that "the decrees did not constitute an insurmountable obstacle to accession."&lt;ref name=Bernd&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernd|2009| p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slovak politician Monika Beňová-Flašiková accused the Hungarian politicians for pushing "revanchist" policies which could destabilize Europe.&lt;ref name=Bernd/&gt; Later on the Hungarian members of the [[Politics of Slovakia|Slovak parliament]] requested for compensation and for a symbolic apology to the victims of the expulsions.&lt;ref name=Bernd/&gt; As an answer, the Slovak government adopted a resolution in September 2007 which declared that the Beneš decrees are inalterable.&lt;ref name=Bernd/&gt;

===During Socialism===
Czechoslovakia (being a Socialist country at that time) financed the following purely Hungarian institutions for the Hungarians in Czechoslovakia as of early 1989: 386 kindergartens, 131 elementary schools, 98 secondary schools, 2 theaters, 1 special Hungarian language publishing house (6 publishing houses also publishing Hungarian literature) and 24 newspapers and journals.
The first Hungarian-language university in Slovakia was opened only in 2004 - the [[Selye János University]].

According to ''The Minorities at Risk Project'':

{{cquote|During the socialist regime, Slovak nationalism was largely kept in check by the strongly centralist Prague regime. The 1968 switch to a federal arrangement gave greater scope to Slovak nationalism, however. New policies of assimilation included progressive Slovakization of education, elimination of Hungarian place-names from signs, bans on using Hungarian in administrative dealings and in institutions and workplaces, and pressure to Slovakize Hungarian names. Nonetheless, the most significant exclusionary factor in Hungarians’ social situation under the socialist regime was most likely their own refusal to integrate into the Czechoslovak system and to learn the language. Without a fluency in the official language, their economic and political opportunities were severely limited.&lt;ref name=MAR&gt;{{Harvnb|MAR|2006| p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Since the independence of Slovakia===
{{Further information|Hungary-Slovakia relations}}

====Hungarian minority parties====

The [[Party of the Hungarian Coalition]] (SMK) and [[Most–Híd]] are the major Hungarian minority parties in Slovak politics. Since 1993 a Hungarian minority party has always been a member of the [[National Council of the Slovak Republic|parliament]]. As of 2012, a Hungarian minority party spent 10 out of 19 years in government.

====Mečiar Government====

Under Communism, the Hungarian minority issue was confined invariably to the position of Slovaks within the Czechoslovak state, and therefore it was ignored in any systematic way.&lt;ref name=Smith155&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000| p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Communism]] reinforced national identities and demolished the ideology of 'the socialist unity of nations'.&lt;ref name=Smith155/&gt; The [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|break-up of Czechoslovakia]] was a process of national redefinition and assertion in Slovakia.&lt;ref name=Smith155/&gt;

[[File:Vladimir meciar.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vladimír Mečiar]] (1942-)]]
During the redrawing of the administrative boundaries of Slovakia, Hungarian politicians suggested two models; the so-called 'Komárno proposals'.&lt;ref name=Smith159&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000| p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first proposal was a full ethnic autonomy of the southern Slovak districts with Hungarian majority, while the second suggestion was to create three counties in southern Slovakia to bring together the main centers of Hungarian population.&lt;ref name=Smith159/&gt; Although a territorial unit of this name [[Komárom county|existed]] before 1918, the borders proposed by SMK were significantly different. The proposed region would have encompassed a very long slice of southern Slovakia, with the explicit aim to create an administrative unit with ethnic-Hungarian majority. Hungarian minority politicians and intellectuals thought that such kind of administrative unit is essential for the long-term survival of the Hungarian minority. Both proposals were rejected by the Slovak government in favour of an eight county model of north-south (and not east-west) governance, which has been seen to weaken the electoral power of Hungarians.&lt;ref name=Smith159/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramet&gt;{{Harvnb|P.

====The use of the Hungarian language====
{{Further information|Language law of Slovakia}}
{{Further information|Hungarian language}}
The Slovak Constitution from 1992 asserts that the ‘[[state language]]’ on the territory of the [[Slovakia|Slovak Republic]] is [[Slovak language|Slovak]].&lt;ref name=Kamusella886&gt;{{Harvnb|Kamusella|2009| p=886}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time this constitution entails explicit provisions for [[minorities]], including language right.&lt;ref name=Bernd202&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernd|2009| p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; These provisions were reinforced in 2001.&lt;ref name=Bernd202/&gt; [[International treaties]] like the ''[[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]]'' (ratified by Slovakia in 1995) or the ''[[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]'' (ratified by Slovakia in 2001) and the ''1995 Treaty on Good Neighbourly Relations and Friendly Cooperations  between Slovakia and Hungary'' protect the language rights of minorities.&lt;ref name=Bernd202/&gt; Article 34. of the 1992 constitution asserts that ''"citizens of ethnic minorities have the right to be educated in their language, the right to use it in dealings with authorities, and the right to participate in the solution of affairs concerning national minorities and ethnic groups".''&lt;ref name="Bernd203"/&gt; These provisions afford a high standard of protection, but still, these legislative instruments do not warrant the implementation of the postulated rights.&lt;ref name=Bernd203/&gt; In most cases the disfrancishement evolves when there is insufficient political will to legislate the provisions as [[law]]s.&lt;ref name=Bernd203/&gt; This happened between 1992 and 1998 (i.e. under Mečiar's government).&lt;ref name=Bernd203/&gt;
Slovak nationalist demands for a language law detaining the use of [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] in public institutions already appeared in 1990.&lt;ref name=Hobsbawm&gt;{{Harvnb|Hobsbawm|1990| p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the Meciar government pushed through legislation restricting the use of [[minority languages]] in public institutions.&lt;ref name=Smith157/&gt; In 1995, the [[National Council of the Slovak Republic|Slovak Parliament]] passed Act No 270 on the State Language of Slovakia, which came into power on 1 January 1996.&lt;ref name=Kamusella888&gt;{{Harvnb|Kamusella|2009| p=888}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act revoked the more tolerant Act No 428 passed in 1990.&lt;ref name=Kamusella888/&gt; The 1995 act emphasized the significance of the Slovak language for Slovak nationalism and statehood, by consolidating the exclusivist [[monolingualism]].&lt;ref name=Kamusella888/&gt; The new act considerably limited the use of minority languages, that is, of Hungarian, which had featured on bilingual signposts with placenames in predominantly Hungarian areas, and in [[bilingual]] school certificates issued to students in Hungarian minority schools.&lt;ref name=Kamusella888/&gt; According to Duray: ''"An official language law&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Language Law of the Slovak Republic. Collection of Laws of 1996, number 270.&lt;/ref&gt; was promulgated providing the legal framework for the official use of the Slovak language not only in official communications but also in everyday commerce, in the administration of religious bodies, and even in the realm of what is normally considered private interaction, for example, communications between patient and physician."''&lt;ref name=Duray&gt;{{Harvnb|Duray|1996| p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the [[Mikuláš Dzurinda|Dzurinda government]] passed Act No 184 on the ''Use of the Languages of the Minority Communities'',&lt;ref name=Kamusella888/&gt; which reintroduced the institution of bilingual school certificates and provided that in communes with more than 20 percent of inhabitants belonging to a given minority, the minority language can be used in administration, and [[signposts]] with placenames can be bilingual.&lt;ref name=Kamusella888/&gt; Furthermore, Article 10, prohibiting doing business and drafting contracts in any other [[language]] but Slovak, was abolished from the Act.&lt;ref name=Kamusella888/&gt; However the act limits itself to only official contacts with the state and thus fails to overcome the 1996 act ensuring the use of Slovak in culture, schools and media.&lt;ref name=Smith161&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000| p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language rights in education have also been a sphere of antagonism between the Slovak state and the Hungarian minority.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000| p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilingual education in priamary and secondary schools is currently permitted.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; However, the array of subjects that should be taught in each language remained a highly contested issue.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; Government proposals prior to the 1998 elections (i.e. under Mečiar's government) even suggested that certain subjects should be taught only by teachers of 'Slovak origin' to ensure that the Slovak population living in areas with significant Hungarian populations should be able to assimilate themselves into mainstream Slovak life.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; According to Duray: "On March 12, 1997 (i.e. under Mečiar's government), the Undersecretary of Education sent a circular to the heads of the school districts making known the following regulations: In Hungarian schools the Slovak language should be taught exclusively by native speakers.&lt;ref name=Duray/&gt; The same exclusion criteria applies to non-Slovak schools in the teaching of geography and history.&lt;ref name=Duray/&gt; (The Undersecretary modified the language of this regulation later by changing the term "exclusively" for "mainly".)&lt;ref name=Duray/&gt; In communities where the Hungarian community exceeds 40% of the total population the teachers of Slovak schools receive supplementary pay.&lt;ref name=Duray/&gt; In all communities which include a Hungarians population and where there is no school or there is no Slovak school, wherever possible a Slovak school should be opened, but not a Hungarian one."&lt;ref name=Duray/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The circular issued by Undersecretary Ondrej Nemcok cites governmental decrees of the Slovak Republic, numbers 459/95, 768/95 and 845/95.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1998 school year a large number of Hungarian pupils handed back their school report that were issued only in Slovak.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

In 2003, there were 295 Hungarian [[elementary school]]s and 75 [[secondary school]]s in Slovakia. In most of them Hungarian was used as the [[medium of instruction]], excluding 35 elementary schools and 18 secondary schools, which were bilingual.&lt;ref name=Kamusella890&gt;{{Harvnb|Kamusella|2009| p=890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the parliamentary elections in 2006, the nationalist [[Slovak National Party]] (SNS) of [[Ján Slota]] became a member of the ruling coalition led by [[Robert Fico]]. In August a few incidents motivated by [[ethnic hatred]] caused diplomatic tensions between the countries. Mainstream Hungarian and Slovak media blamed Slota's anti-Hungarian statements from the early summer for worsening ethnic relations. (Further informations: [[2006 Slovak-Hungarian diplomatic affairs]], and [[Hedvig Malina]]).

On 27 September 2007 the Beneš decrees were reconfirmed by the Slovak parliament which legitimized the [[Hungarians]] and Germans calumniation and deportation from Czechoslovakia after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="politics"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = mkp | url = http://www.mkp.sk/eng/images/pdf/MINORITY%20REPORT%20-%20OCTOBER.pdf | format = PDF | title = The Beneš-Decrees Are Untouchable | year = 2007 | accessdate = October 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080904004658/http://www.mkp.sk/eng/images/pdf/MINORITY%20REPORT%20-%20OCTOBER.pdf | archivedate = 4 September 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the dioceses of the [[Roman Catholicism in Slovakia|Roman Catholic Church in Slovakia]] were reorganized. 8 dioceses were introduced in place of the previous 6. Until the reform the area of ''[[Žitný ostrov]]'' (Hungarian: ''Csallóköz''), the ''[[Matúšova zem]]'' (''Mátyusföld'') and ''[[Poiplie]]'' (''Ipolymente'') - where a big portion of the Hungarians of Slovakia resides - belonged to the [[Archdiocese of Bratislava-Trnava]]. Now it belongs to four different dioceses. This triggered the protest of Hungarian catholic worshippers and priests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bumm.sk/nezopont/6/16633/nyilt-level-a-szlovak-puspokkari-konferenciahoz.html bumm.sk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310232041/http://www.bumm.sk/nezopont/6/16633/nyilt-level-a-szlovak-puspokkari-konferenciahoz.html |date=10 March 2008 }} Nyílt levél a szlovák püspökkari konferenciához. (27 February 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the reform was introduced by the [[Holy See|Vatican]], not by the Slovak Republic.

Also in 2008, [[Ján Mikolaj]] (SNS), minister of education propagated changes in the Hungarian schools of Slovakia. According to a new education law plan, the Hungarian language which was educated as mother tongue until now will be considered a foreign language - and taught in a smaller proportion of lessons. The only textbooks allowed to be used in Hungarian schools will be those translated from Slovak books and approved by Slovak administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bumm|2008| p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In October 2008 Hungarian parents and teachers sent back Hungarian textbooks to the Minister of Education.&lt;ref name=Sanoma&gt;{{cite web|title=Visszaküldik a magyar neveket bojkottáló szlovák tankönyveket|language=Hungarian|url=http://www.fn.hu/kulfold/20081008/visszakuldik_magyar_neveket_bojkottalo/|work=[[Figyelő]]|publisher=[[Sanoma]]|date=2008-10-08|accessdate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books contained geographical names only in Slovak violating the basic rules of the [[Hungarian language]] and the minorities' right of usage of their native language.&lt;ref name=Sanoma/&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Slovak authorities denied the registration of a Hungarian traditional folk art association, because they used the Hungarian word ''Kárpát-medence'' ([[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]]). According to [[Dušan Čaplovič]] the word and the association is against the sovereignty of Slovakia, furthermore the word is fascist, it is familiar with the German [[Lebensraum]], and Hungarians use it in this ideology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hirszerzo.hu/cikk.a_karpat-medence_a_lebensraum_magyar_megfeleloje_a_szlovak_miniszterelnok-helyettes_szerint.87635.html [[Hírszerző]], (in Hungarian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ujszo.com/online/kozelet/2008/11/19/a-belugy-eltorolte-a-karpat-medencet (in Hungarian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://atv.hu/hircentrum/2008_nov_caplovic__a__karpat_medence__ugyanaz__mint_a_naci__eletter__.html (In Hungarian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mno.hu/portal/598288?searchtext=lebensraum (in Hungarian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.individual.com/story.php?story=92341355, (in ENGLISH) Nov 20, 2008 (BBC Monitoring via COMTEX)&lt;/ref&gt;

The particular anti-Hungarian edge of the Slovak public discourse reached its top in the 2010 parliamentary elections, when numerous parties have been campaigning with latent to openly anti-Hungarian slogans. The presently governing [[Smer]] has rented billboards that have warned that "They have given power to SMK! They will do it again!",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====2011 Census====

In January 2011, a Hungarian sociologist László Gyurgyík expected that, by the May 2011 census, the number of Hungarian ethnicity citizens in Slovakia will be between 460,000 and 490,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sme.sk/c/5710278/bugar-madari-hlaste-sa.html|title=Bugár: Hungarians, show up!

===="Wise historism"====
{{Off topic|date=June 2014}}
Since deputy prime minister [[Robert Fico]] declared the "wise historism" concept, the history books are getting rewritten at a faster pace than before, and in an increased "spirit of national pride",&lt;ref name="cancel"&gt;[http://www.spectator.sk/articles/view/8878// Matica Slovenská cancels history textbook], [[Slovak Spectator]], July 31, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; {{Failed verification|date=December 2008}} &lt;ref name="inventing" /&gt; which Krekovič, Mannová and Krekovičová claim are mainly nothing else, but history falsifications.&lt;ref name="inventing" /&gt; Such new inventions are the interpretation of Great Moravia as a (proto)-Slovak state, or the term "proto-Slovak" itself,&lt;ref name="inventing"&gt;{{Harvnb|Krekovič|Mannová|Krekovičová|2005| pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the "refreshing" of many "old traditions", that in fact did not exist or were not Slovak before.&lt;ref name="inventing" /&gt; The concept received criticism in Slovakia pointing out that the term  proto-Slovak cannot be found in any serious publication, simply because it lacks any scientific basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nol.hu/cikk/476555/ Népszabadság Online: Fico: Szvatopluk volt első királyunk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miroslav Kusý]] Slovak political scientist explained that by adopting such scientifically questionable rhetoric Fico aims to "strengthen national consciousness by falsification of history".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mno.hu/portal/535174 MN Magyar Nemzet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Per [[WP:RSUE]], please provide original language of quotes [[Népszabadság]] "A "régi szlovákok" kifejezéssel egyetlen komoly publikációban sem találkozunk, mert ez a megnevezés egyszerűen minden tudományos alapot nélkülöz - szögezte le."

(note, "he" refers to Dusan Kovác Slovak historian/academic) [[Magyar Nemzet]] A kormány ünnepi nyilatkozatában meghirdetett „okos historizmus” és a hazafiasság programjáról szólva Miroslav Kusy szlovák politológus az Új Szóban kijelentette: a régi nagymorva birodalombeli szlovákok felemlegetésével Robert Fico kormányfő olyan – szakmailag megkérdőjelezhető – retorikát vesz át, amely azt jelzi, hogy „a történelem hamis ábrázolásával erősíti a nemzettudatot”.

"false" "painting") of history"   --&gt;

==Rusyns==
The ethnic relationship of [[Prešov Region]] is complex and volatile. A long-term cultural and everyday cohabition of [[Rusyns]], Slovaks and [[Hungarians]], under the prepodence of the non-Rusyn element led to the linguistic Slovakization of Rusyns, while in some parts (in cities and ethnic islands in the south) they were Magyarized. Still, in both cases they preserved their religion ([[Greek Catholicism]]). Until the 1920s, the Slovak-speaking Greek-Catholics composed a transitional group that was connected with the Rusyns through religion and traditions, with Slovak as their language. Their number was gradually increasing with the transition of the parts of Rusyn population to the Slovak language. Slovakization of the Rusyn population increased in the times of the Czechoslovakian authorities (since 1920). The Greek Catholics and Orthodox started to perceive themselves as Slovaks. It is difficult to estimate the distribution of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and the [[Greek Catholic]]s by the language as well as to determine the number of Rusyns because both the Hungarian and Czechoslovakian censuses provided the incorrect number of Rusyns, but it contains roughly 50-100 000 people. According to censuses the decrease of the number of Rusyns was influenced not only by Slovakization but also by emigration of a significant number of Rusyns from Prešov, mainly to the Czech lands.

The Slovak pressure on Rusyns in Slovakia increased after 1919 when Czechoslovakia incorporated [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]] to the east of the [[Uzh River]]. The Slovakization of Rusyns (and Ukrainians) was a part of the program of the [[Slovak People's Party]], whose leader refused to cooperate with the Rusyn politicians of Transcarpathia but cooperated with Hungarian-speaking A. Brody. Therefore, the Rusyn politicians opened the links with the [[Czechs|Czech]] political parties which were supportive of neutrality towards the Rusyn question. The cultural Slovak-Rusyn relations at the time were minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Entsyklopediia Ukrainoznavstva'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poles==
{{See also|Szepes county}}
The early Hungarian censuses ignored the Polish nationality, all ethnic Poles were registered as [[Slovaks]]. There was also a very strong process of Slovakization of Polish people throughout 18th–20th centuries, mostly done by Roman Catholic Church, in which institution the local aboriginal Polish priests were replaced with Slovak ones. Also the institution of schooling was replacing the Polish language with Slovak during classes.&lt;ref&gt;M.

'''Spaltklang''' (literally: ''split sound'') is a term in [[music theory]]. It is defined as an extremely clear and transparent sound pattern of an [[instrumental piece]]. It stands in opposition to the music of the Classical-Romantic period which favoured the merging of the individual instrumental voices to one complex sound.

Examples of applied Spaltklang can be found in [[New Music]] such as [[Igor Stravinsky]]’s [[Histoire du soldat]]. Instrumental categories are represented by the high- and low-[[Pitch (music)|pitch]]ed instruments; middle-toned instruments, on the other hand, are not accounted for. In the [[string section]], for instance, only [[violin]] and [[double bass]] are represented, while [[viola]] and [[cello]] are not. This pitch gap creates a clear contrast and prevents the individual tones from merging into one sound.

Moreover, the term appears in connection with [[multiphonics]].

The term Spaltklang can also be found in the field of [[organ building]]. Here, it refers to organs that have [[Register (phonology)|registers]] with very different and distinct [[timbres]]. Therefore, single registers tend to be played in isolation. This is in contrast to organs which operate on the basis of a merged sound, which is achieved by adding registers to a [[root note]]. Spaltklang seems to be particularly associated with organs from the [[Renaissance]] period. Amongst organists, Spaltklang is furthermore used to describe the omission of a register, e.g. playing the 8‘ and 2’ registers but omitting the 4’ register.

The '''Station North Arts and Entertainment District''' (often referred to as just '''Station North''') is an area and official arts and entertainment district in the [[United States|U.S.]] city of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. The neighborhood is marked by a combination of artistically-leaning commercial ventures, such as theaters and museums, as well as formerly abandoned warehouses that have since been converted into loft-style living. It is roughly triangular, bounded on the north by 20th Street, on the east by Greenmount Avenue, and on the south and west by the tracks of [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]], though the neighborhood's boundaries include a one-block wide extension over the tracks.

==History==
Station North is composed of portions of three Baltimore neighborhoods: Charles North, Greenmount West, and Barclay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stationnorth.org/about |title=Station North: About |first=John McCartin |accessdate=July 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent decades, the area represented a relatively impoverished area between the wealthier neighborhoods of [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon]], [[Bolton Hill]], and [[Charles Village, Baltimore|Charles Village]]. However, in addition to its proximity to those neighborhoods, a number of factors made the area amenable to redevelopment and [[gentrification]]. Much of even the poorest sections of the neighborhood feature beautiful, three-story, early 20th-century [[rowhouse]]s as the main housing stock; the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] is within walking distance; and [[Pennsylvania Station (Baltimore)|Penn Station]] lies at the south edge of the neighborhood, providing walking-distance access to Amtrak, [[Baltimore Light Rail|Light Rail]] and [[MARC Train|MARC commuter rail]] service (the latter being of particular interest to those commuting to [[Washington, D.C.]]). The [[United States housing bubble|real estate bubble]] of the 2000s caused Baltimore's housing prices to skyrocket, and drove home buyers seeking out cheaper areas on the upswing to the neighborhood.

The Baltimore city government's 2002 designation of the area as an arts district has furthered the neighborhood's transformation. The earliest and most visible signs of change were the official conversion of several industrial and warehouse buildings to mixed-use housing. The [[Copycat Building]] is probably the best known, but two other buildings—the Oliver Street Studios Building (which also houses Area 405 and the Station North Tool Library) and the Cork Factory—are also occupied. These buildings have been in use recently as artist's studios and benefitted by the area winning the State of Maryland's first Arts and Entertainment District status under then-mayor [[Martin O'Malley]]. Such designation paved the way for these buildings to be rezoned for residential use, due to the collaboration between multiple building owners in The District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=4761 |title=For Industry to Easels - Arts District Designation Easing Conversion of Factories to Studios |first=Brennen Jensen |date=May 8, 2002 |publisher=Baltimore City Paper |accessdate=January 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708161929/http://www2.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=4761 |archivedate=July 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neighborhood's commercial, residential, and artistic venues began to thrive. The commercial district on Charles Street is anchored by the [[Charles Theatre]], a popular art house multiplex that also serves as the anchor venue for the annual [[Maryland Film Festival]] each May, as well as Scapescape (a music and arts festival) each Labor Day weekend,[http://www.stationnortharts.com The Station North Arts Cafe Gallery], the Station North Arts Underground, [http://themetrogallery.net/ The Metro Gallery], Tapas Teatro, [http://www.clubcharles.us/ Club Charles], The Yellow Sign Theater, [http://www.strand-theater.org/ The Strand Theater], [http://singlecarrot.com/ Single Carrot Theater], and Sofi's Crepes; one block away is the [[Charm City Art Space]] which serves as a Music Venue, and Art Gallery.  In recent years, the North Avenue corridor has become a hub of activity with Joe Squared Restaurant, The Wind Up Space (an arts venue and bar), Liam Flynn's Ale House, and The Chicken Box, a Station North Arts District sponsored multiuse arts space opened in mid-2013. The Chicken Box is also home to the [http://www.baltimoreannextheater.org/ Baltimore Annex Theater].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/blog/real-estate/2012/12/station-north-arts-and-entertainment.html?page=all | title=Station North Arts and Entertainment, Annex Theater begin work on new space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2005, the neighborhood was seeing a definite boom, but areas of blight persisted, particularly at the northern and eastern edges. As of 2010, the northern and eastern edges of Station North, particularly near Greenmount Avenue, are still affected by vacant housing, [[drug dealing]], and [[prostitution]]. This area stands in stark contrast to the environment only a few blocks west, where in 2007 the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060117031415/http://www.stationnorthtownhomes.com/ Station North Townhomes] were completed. The proximity of these luxury $300,000 townhouses to the remaining areas of urban decay illustrates both the potential and the challenges that the neighborhood faces.

==Maryland Arts and Entertainment District designation==
[[Image:Station North Arts District Baltimore Chas St.jpg|400px|right|thumb|Looking north on Charles Street, with the Charles Theatre on the right.]]
In Maryland, the State Department of Business and Economic Development designates certain neighborhoods “arts and entertainment districts”, which confers three specific tax breaks. Artists who live and work in the district are offered property-tax credits on qualifying renovations, can apply for an income-tax credit when they make money on their art, and are given a waiver of the admissions and amusement tax charged by the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanitebaltimore.com/sub.cfm?issueID=50&amp;sectionID=4&amp;articleID=699 |title=The SoHo Effect: In a creative-class economy, cities are increasingly banking on artists to save neighborhoods.

Major tax benefits concerning building usage are also in place, with assessment freezes and building rehab credits to encourage growth.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Criticism of gentrification==
It has been argued that the Arts District designation confers little benefit to the artists who worked so tirelessly to rebuild the area and change the antiquated zoning laws which were heavy industrial, to mixed use - for studios, retail and living spaces. Many of the benefits promised residents and building owners when the District was formed have never materialized and the line of direct communication with the Mayor's office, which oversaw the transformation, is just a faded memory.

Although the city and state have developed preliminary plans to provide affordable housing and work space for local artists and residents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimorehousing.org/pressroom_detail.asp?id=104 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721072151/http://www.baltimorehousing.org/pressroom_detail.asp?id=104 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-21 |title=Preserving Affordable Housing in Greenmount West |first=John Fritze |date=unknown, 2007? |publisher=Baltimore Sun |accessdate=January 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many argue that the area provides few actual benefits to working artists. This has fostered the sentiment that the city has been exploiting the cachet of the artists in Station North, while rarely working with them in any meaningful way.

Furthermore, as the neighborhood undergoes gentrification, there is the concern that, like [[SoHo]] in [[Manhattan]] before it, local artists and entertainers will be forced out of the neighborhood if a proper balance is not struck between redevelopment and the needs of artists and lower income residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanitebaltimore.com/sub.cfm?issueID=50&amp;sectionID=4&amp;articleID=699 |title=The SoHo Effect: In a creative-class economy, cities are increasingly banking on artists to save neighborhoods.

==Transportation==

Station North's namesake comes from its placement of being north of [[Penn Station (Baltimore)|Penn Station]], which houses [[Amtrak]] and [[MARC (rail)|MARC]] trains. The [[Baltimore Light Rail]]  has two stations that are within proximity to the district; [[Penn Station (Baltimore)|Penn Station]] and [[North Avenue (Baltimore Light Rail station)|North Avenue]]. [[MTA Maryland]] bus lines 3, 8, 11, 13, 27, 36, 61, and 64 also service the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/ST+PAUL+ST+%26+PENN+STATION+DR+sb/@39.3117647,-76.6175071,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c80494e6848cf5:0x603d8ba26f401b10?hl=en | title=SAINT PAUL ST &amp; PENN STATION fs sb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future plans==

A 2006 Action Plan Report, prepared by Randall Gross / Development Economics, the Baltimore Neighborhood Collaborative, and Station North Arts &amp; Entertainment, Inc., focuses on four key strategies: To strengthen positive image and identity, to establish commercial corridors, to provide housing options to attract new residents while preventing displacement of existing residents, and to encourage economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abagmd.org/usr_doc/SN_Action_Plan.pdf |title=Action Plan Report: Station North Strategic Plan |date=August 2006 |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2008, Baltimore’s development arm, the Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC), released a preview of their master plan for the area. In the near term, the master plan includes converting the top three floors of Penn Station into a botique hotel, with long-term goals including construction of high-rise residential buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoregrows.com/2008/01/29/master-plan-for-charles-north |title= Master Plan for Charles North |date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2008, Mayor [[Sheila Dixon]] unveiled the Charles North Vision Plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoredevelopment.com/files/pdf/rfp/upload/CharlesNorth_Brochure_lowres.pdf |title=Press Release: Vision Plan for Charles North |accessdate=January 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123032815/http://www.baltimoredevelopment.com/files/pdf/rfp/upload/CharlesNorth_Brochure_lowres.pdf |archivedate=November 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoredevelopment.com/files/pdf/rfp/upload/Charles%20North%20Vision%20Plan%20Presentation.pdf |title=Charles North Vision Plan |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; a multi-phased development initiative. This plan identified four areas to focus revitalization on: Charles Gateway/Penn Station, the corner of Charles Street and North Avenue, the creation of an "Asia Town" at 20th Street and Charles Street, and the "Creative/Design Zone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baltimorecity.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=xb8yKcmAVao%3d&amp;tabid=1177&amp;mid=2230 |title=Mayor Dixon and Central Baltimore Community Announce Charles North Vision Plan |date=October 30, 2008 |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoredevelopment.com/files/pdf/rfp/upload/0806%5b1%5d...L%20BOOK.pdf |title=Charles North: The Operations Manual |date=June 18, 2008 |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan's ultimate goal is to transform the arts and entertainment district north of Pennsylvania Station into a $1 billion "cultural crossroads" for Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2008-10-30/news/0810290151_1_charles-north-north-vision-north-avenue |title=City unveils 30-year plan to transform 100-acre north pf Penn Station into a regional crossroads of culture |first=Edward Gunts |date=October 30, 2008 |publisher=The Baltimore Sun |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan calls for over $100 million in subsidies to aid in the development of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoredevelopment.com/files/pdf/rfp/upload/Charles%20North%20Vision%20Plan%20Presentation.pdf |title=Charles North Vision Plan |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement with Hospitality Partners of Bethesda to construct the hotel in Penn Station was reached in 2009, with completion of the $9 million project scheduled for late 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-05-29/business/0905280098_1_amtrak-train-station-penn-station |title=Inn Pulls Into Station: Amtrak Plans Hotel In Area Tagged For Revitalization |first=Edward Gunts |date=May 29, 2009 |publisher=Baltimore Sun |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, construction began on City Arts, a $15 million housing development for artists. Consisting of 69 apartments for rent and eight town houses for sale, City Arts will be the first all-new housing project in the {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} arts district since a $1 billion "vision plan" was unveiled for the area in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bal-bz.digest082jan08,0,2961754.story |title=InConstruction begins on City Arts housing for artists |first=Edward Gunts |date=January 8, 2010 |publisher=Baltimore Sun |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building will consist of four stories of apartments, a multipurpose first-floor space provided for artistic use by the residents, and thirty-five off-street parking spaces. Key to the project’s plans are financing regulations that will ensure the space remains affordable to artists even as the neighborhood changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://urbandiscoveriesblog.com/2009/06/25/development-spotlight-city-arts/ |title=Development Spotlight: City Arts |first=Edward Gunts |date=June 25, 2009 |publisher=Urban Discoveries Baltimore |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was featured on CNN as an example of how federal Recovery Act money has restarted development that stalled during the economic downturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/business/2009/09/22/endo.neighborhood.makeover.cnn |title=Neighborhood Gets A Makeover |first=Sandra Endo |date=September 22, 2009 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Finnish Institute in France''', '''Institut finlandais''', is a cultural institute representing Finland in France. The institute was opened in 1990 at 60 Rue des Écoles, situated in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement in Paris]].

==Presentation of The Finnish Institute in France==

===The Building===

The [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann|Haussman]] building, dating back to 1862, that hosts the institute today was formerly a movie theatre, Cinéma Cluny-Écoles, which closed in 1985. [[Juhani Pallasmaa]], a famous and renowned Finnish architect was chosen to implement the renovation of the space, and transform it into the Finnish institute. The interior and the furnishings of the institute were chosen in representation of Finnish design and typical materials used in decoration and interior design in Finland. The dominating elements in the decoration are wood and the grand windows of the grande salle which have an aerial view on [[Musée national du Moyen Âge|Musée de Cluny]]. The institute space has a surface of 600 square meters, and it is funded by the Finnish state. The space includes a multipurpose room with 200 places, a movie theatre with 90 places, a seminar room and library.

===Management===

The current director of the institute is Meena Kaunisto.

'''''The Journal of Korean Studies''''' is a biannual [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering [[Korean studies]]. It was established in 1969. The original series had two issues numbered Volume 1 (1969) and 2 (1971) that were [[Editor-in-chief|edited]] by David Messler ([[University of Washington-Seattle]]). A decade later, [[James Palais]] (University of Washington-Seattle) edited and published volumes 1-5 of the second series (1979-1987). Volumes 6-8 (1988-1992) were edited by Mike Robinson ([[Indiana University Bloomington]]).

In 2004 the Korean Studies Program of the [[Asia–Pacific Research Center|Walter H. Shorenstein Asia–Pacific Research Center]] ([[Stanford University]]) and editors Gi-wook Shin and John Duncan revived the journal and published volumes 9-13. In August 2008, Clark W. Sorensen (University of Washington-Seattle) became editor-in-chief. In 2011, ''The Journal of Korean Studies'' became a biannual publication. The spring issue is a regular, varied-topic issue, whereas the fall issue is a thematic issue devoted to one topic. In addition to scholarly articles, the journal publishes reviews of the latest Korea-related books.

In July 2016, the journal moved from the University of Washington to the Center for Korean Studies in the Weatherhead East Asian Institute, Columbia University. Theodore Hughes is Editor-in-Chief.

The journal is published by [[Duke University Press]] and is also available digitally through [[Project MUSE]]. It is abstracted and indexed in the [[Social Sciences Citation Index]], [[Sociological Abstracts]], [[Social Services Abstracts]], [[Worldwide Political Science Abstracts]], [[PAIS International]], [[Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts]], [[Bibliography of Asian Studies]], [[Historical Abstracts]], and [[America: History and Life]].

'''Tradigital art''' is [[art]] (including [[animation]]) that combines both traditional and computer-based techniques to create an image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordspy.com/words/tradigital.asp WordSpy entry] for ''tradigital''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Unique.jpg|right|thumb|Unique Editions&lt;br&gt;top, left to right: [[Bonny Lhotka]], Judith Moncrieff;&lt;br&gt;bottom, left to right: Dorothy Krause, Karin Schminke, Helen Golden]]
Artist and teacher [[Judith Moncrieff]] first coined the term. In the early 1990s, while an instructor at the [[Pacific Northwest College of Art]], Moncrieff invented and taught a new digital medium called "Tradigital". The school held a competition between Moncrieff's students, who used the medium to electronically combine everything from photographs of costumes to stills from videotapes of performing dancers.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Gragg, "Art students get a crack at 'Nutcracker'," ''Portland Oregonian'', October 25, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lisawrayart.com"&gt;Lisa Wray, [http://www.lisawrayart.com/index.htm ''Judith Montcrieff, Unique Editions and Tradigital Fine Art''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713212916/http://www.lisawrayart.com/index.htm |date=2011-07-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moncrieff also referred to her business entity (formerly "Moncrieff Studios") as "Tradigital Imaging" around the same period.

Moncrieff was one of five founding members of the digital art collective called "Unique Editions". These five artists—Helen Golden, [[Bonny Lhotka]], Dorothy Krause,&lt;ref&gt;William Zimmer, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E5DD1339F93BA25751C0A960958260 "ART;A Family and Its Gallery Click on the Future"], ''The New York Times'', February 18, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Moncrieff, and Karin Schminke—combined their expertise in traditional studio media and techniques with [[digital imaging]] to produce original fine art and editions. The artists met in June, 1994, at "Beyond the Digital Print", a workshop organized by Krause at [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in Boston. The artists' varied backgrounds are evident in their mixed media approach to using the computer as an art-making tool. Although every image is conceived and executed at least in part on the computer, the range of work includes one of a kind paintings, collages, Polaroid and image transfers, monotypes and prints on such varied substrates as canvas, handmade paper, and embossed metal. Moncrieff used the term "Tradigital media" to describe this merging of traditional and digital tools and "tradigitalism" as a name for this emerging movement. Unique Editions also served as a research and public relations entity for exploring technologies and promoting digital art. The group forged links with hardware and software developers in an effort to provide feedback on their products from the artist's perspective. It served as a demonstration to the rest of the art world of the role of digital technologies in the artist's studio. Unique Editions became inactive in 1997; however, Golden and Moncrieff continued to work together under the name, "Tradigital Fine Art".&lt;ref name="lisawrayart.com"/&gt;

Independently in the early 1990s, artist [[Lisa Wray]] was developing the fine art style she calls "Renaissance of Metaphysical Imagery". Prototypes were made for each work from color copies, color photos or film negatives made in her graphic arts darkroom. In 1990, she visited the only two places in the country with proprietary computer systems capable of assembling her prototypes: Raphael Digital Transparencies in Houston Texas, and Dodge Color Laboratories in Washington D.C. The first two prototypes, Brew of Life and Fantasy, were assembled by Dodge Color Laboratories on a Superset machine that was first developed by the Department of Defense. The final art was archived on 1" magnetic tape, and then output as an 11x14” color film transparency. Lisa discovered Judith Montcrieff and her pioneering efforts with Unique Editions and Tradigital Fine Art, in the early 1990s, found the term, "Tradigital", and also used the term to describe her own work.&lt;ref name="lisawrayart.com"/&gt;

==Other uses of the term==
Since then, use of the term has greatly expanded to include other art forms.

In 2002, "tradigital" went mainstream when [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] used the term '''tradigital animation''' to refer to the blending of computer animation with classical [[cell animation]] techniques, "a seamless blend of two-dimensional and three-dimensional animation techniques".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Doherty, [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=106FA0A1A27D07B8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "Sense and Cinematography"], ''The Boston Globe'', Dec 12, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned as examples such animation films as ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[Antz]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', and ''[[Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Kehr, [http://movies.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9A04E6DE1F38F937A15756C0A9649C8B63 "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"], ''The New York Times'', May 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Canemaker, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E0DC1430F931A25756C0A9649C8B63 "SUMMER MOVIES; Flat Worlders Face the Horizon and See It's in 3-D"], ''The New York Times'', May 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Horwitz, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A2169-2002May23 Stallion vs. Iron Horse: A Galloping Good Tale], ''The Washington Post'', May 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd Leopold, [http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/22/ca.s02.spirit.katzenberg/index.html "The 'Spirit' of a movie mogul"], ''CNN'', May 22, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nina Rehfeld, [https://www.welt.de/print-wams/article104216/Die_Zukunft_der_Maerchen.html "Die Zukunft der Märchen"], ''Die Welt'', Dec. 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Moore, "The 'Spirit' of Jeffrey Katzenberg," ''The Orlando Sentinel'', May 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that [[Walt Disney]] (a [[traditional art]] animator) would approve of the changes in the way cartoons are made today. Animation World Magazine&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Edwards, [http://www.awn.com/mag/issue6.01/6.01pages/edwardstelevision.php3 "Tradigital Television: Digital Tools and Saturday Morning"], ''Animation World Magazine'', Issue 6.01, April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; describes '''tradigital television''', and the impact of tradigital animation on pre- and post-production processes for television shows.

'''Tradigital printing''' is an experimental approach to [[printmaking]] with contemporary technology. In one form of tradigital printing, printmakers use computers to generate positives for UV photo transfer to plates and screens. In another form, digital print output incorporating [[silkscreen]], relief or [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] techniques is the focus. For example, the Josephine Press&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Press, [http://www.josephinepress.com/tradigital.html ''Tradigital Printmaking''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630045035/http://www.josephinepress.com/tradigital.html |date=2008-06-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; uses a process that combines the use of archival digital prints with traditional techniques such as intaglio, [[woodcut]]s, [[lithograph]]s, and all of the other traditional printmaking methods. The process allows the artist to create a multi-color image without using a four-plate process. In addition to more efficient registration, the artist can work with collage and other mixed media works that can be scanned and reproduced in an archival manner. Tradigital printing greatly expands the possibilities of image-making while still producing an original hand pulled, limited edition, fine art print.

A recent Wall Street Journal article hailed '''tradigital creatives''' as the "voice of tomorrow",&lt;ref&gt;Manish Sinha, [http://www.livemint.com/2008/08/14151616/Web-Exclusive--Creativity-in.html "Creativity in tradigital times"], The Wall Street Journal, Aug 14 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; contrasting them with both "traditionalists" and "digitalists", and identifying several distinguishing characteristics of the new art/marketing medium: voices not eyeballs; experience not messages; community not communication; utility and solutions not cleverness; collaborative not silo thinkers.

[[Human resource management]] regards '''training and development''' as a function concerned with organizational activity aimed at bettering the [[job performance]] of individuals and groups in [[organization]]al settings. Training and development can be described as "an educational process which involves the sharpening of skills, concepts, changing of attitude and gaining more knowledge to enhance the performance of employees".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The field has gone by several names, including "human resource development", "human capital development" and "learning and development".

==History==
The name of the discipline has been debated, with the [[Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development]] in 2000 arguing that "human resource development" is too evocative of the master-slave relationship between employer and employee for those who refer to their employees as "partners" or "associates" to feel comfortable with.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;{{cite book|title=Learning and Development|author=Rosemary Harrison|pages=5|publisher=CIPD Publishing|date=2005|isbn=9781843980506}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.potential.com/en/development-program/ Employee Development]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the CIPD settled upon "learning and development", although that was itself not free from problems, "learning" being an over-general and ambiguous name, and most organizations referring to it as "training and development".&lt;ref name=Harrison /&gt;

==Practice==
Training and development encompasses three main activities: training, education, and development.&lt;ref name=Harrison /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Management|author1=Patrick J. Montana  |author2=Bruce H. Charnov |lastauthoramp=yes |pages=225|chapter=Training and Development|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|date=2000|isbn=9780764112768}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IITD&gt;{{cite book|title=Training and Development in Ireland|author1=Thomas N. Garavan |author2=Pat Costine |author3=Noreen Heraty  |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA|date=1995|pages=1|chapter=Training and Development: Concepts, Attitudes, and Issues|isbn=9781872853925}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Training: This activity is both focused upon, and evaluated against, the job that an individual currently holds.&lt;ref name=IITD /&gt;
* Education: This activity focuses upon the jobs that an individual may potentially hold in the future, and is evaluated against those jobs.&lt;ref name=IITD /&gt;
* Development: This activity focuses upon the activities that the organization employing the individual, or that the individual is part of, may partake in the future, and is almost impossible to evaluate.&lt;ref name=IITD /&gt;

The "stakeholders" in training and development are categorized into several classes. The sponsors of training and development are senior managers. The clients of training and development are business planners. Line managers are responsible for coaching, resources, and performance. The participants are those who actually undergo the processes. The facilitators are Human Resource Management staff. And the providers are specialists in the field. Each of these groups has its own agenda and motivations, which sometimes conflict with the agendas and motivations of the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Resource Management|author1=Derek Torrington |author2=Laura Hall |author3=Stephen Taylor  |last-author-amp=yes |pages=363|publisher=Pearson Education|date=2004|isbn=9780273687139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflicts that are the best part of career consequences are those that take place between employees and their bosses. The number one reason people leave their jobs is conflict with their bosses. And yet, as author, workplace relationship authority, and executive coach, Dr. John Hoover&lt;ref&gt;John Hoover, PhD ''"How to Work for an Idiot: Survive and Thrive Without Killing Your Boss"'' (Career Press {{ISBN|1564147045}}/{{ISBN|978-1564147042}})&lt;/ref&gt; points out, "Tempting as it is, nobody ever enhanced his or her career by making the boss look stupid."  Training an employee to get along well with authority and with people who entertain diverse points of view is one of the best guarantees of long-term success. Talent, knowledge, and skill alone won't compensate for a sour relationship with a superior, peer, or customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tannenbaum|first1=S I|last2=Yukl|first2=G|title=Training and Development in Work Organizations|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=January 1992|volume=43|issue=1|pages=399–441|doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.43.020192.002151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Connecting Coaches to Corporates|url=https://twofold.asia/|website=twofold.asia|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many training and development approaches available for organisations are proposed including: on-the-job training, mentoring, apprenticeship, simulation, web-based learning, instructor-led classroom training, programmed self-instruction, case studies/role playing, systematic job rotations and transfers .etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Athanasios|first=Chatzimouratidis|date=March 1, 2012|title=Decision support systems for human resource training and development|url=|journal=International Journal of Human Resource Management. March 1, 2012,|volume= 23| issue = 4|pages=662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical roles in the field include executive and supervisory/management development, new-employee orientation, professional-skills training, technical/job training, customer-service training, sales-and-marketing training, and health-and-safety training. Job titles may include vice-president of organizational effectiveness, training manager or director, management development specialist, [[blended-learning]] designer, training-needs analyst, chief learning officer, and individual career-development advisor.

Talent development is the process of changing an [[organization]], its [[employee]]s, its [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s, and groups of people within it, using planned and unplanned learning, in order to achieve and maintain a competitive advantage for the organization. Rothwell notes that the name may well be a term in search of a meaning, like so much in management, and suggests that it be thought of as selective attention paid to the top 10% of employees, either by potential or performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Strategic Development of Talent|author1=William J. Rothwell  |author2=H. C. Kazanas |lastauthoramp=yes |pages=4|date=2004|publisher=Human Resource Development Press|isbn=0-87425-752-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Effective Succession Planning|pages=xviii|author=William J. Rothwell|date=2005|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt|isbn=0-8144-0842-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While talent development is reserved for the top management it is becoming increasingly clear that career development is necessary for the [[Employee retention|retention]] of any employee, no matter what their level in the company. Research has shown that some type of career path is necessary for [[job satisfaction]] and hence job retention. Perhaps organizations need to include this area in their overview of employee satisfaction.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The term talent development is becoming increasingly popular in several organizations, as companies are now moving from the traditional term training and development. Talent development encompasses a variety of components such as training, career development, career management, and organizational development, and training and development. It is expected that during the 21st century more companies will begin to use more integrated terms such as talent development.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

A '''travelling exhibition''', also referred to as a "'''travelling exhibit'''" or a "'''touring exhibition'''", is a type of [[art exhibition|exhibition]] that is presented at more than one venue.

Temporary exhibitions can bring together objects that might be dispersed among several collections, to reconstruct an original context such as an artist’s career or a patron's collection, or to propose connections - perhaps the result of recent research - which give new insights or a different way of understanding items in museum collections. The whole [[art exhibition|exhibition]], usually with associated services, including insurance, shipping, storage, conservation, mounting, set up, etc., can then be loaned to one or more venues to lengthen the life of the exhibition and to allow the widest possible audiences - regionally, nationally or internationally - to experience these objects and the stories they contain. Such collaborations can add interest to museums where displays of permanent collections might change only slowly, helping to provide fresh interpretations or more complete stories and attract new audiences. They also provide fresh ideas and breathing space for organisations which have exhibition spaces but lack permanent collections.

To have more than one location for the same exhibition can benefit the organiser because it can then share a part of the production costs among the venues, so [[museums]] and [[art gallery|galleries]] frequently use touring as a cost-efficient way of promoting access to their collections. For organisers and their venues, touring exhibitions are important for sharing '''ideas''' (for example, promoting techniques for providing for visitors with visual impairments or producing displays which examine current or topical issues) and '''materials''' (especially objects that might not be seen in public frequently or even shown together), as well as '''resources''' (human as well as financial). Touring is a way of sharing with like-minded institutions and of achieving economies of scale which allow more ambitious projects to happen.

Travelling exhibitions are often supported by governmental organizations to promote access to knowledge and materials that might not be available locally. To acknowledge the importance of travelling exhibitions, in 1983 the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) established the [[International Committee for Exhibition Exchange]] (ICEE) as a forum to discuss the different aspects of exhibition development, circulation and exchange.

'''Waste No Food''' is a [non-profit organization] that provides a web-based [[food rescue]] "marketplace" allowing excess food to be donated from the food service industry to qualified charities that work with the needy. It facilitates the donation of [[food waste]] from farms, restaurants and grocery stores to charities that can use it. Recipient charities are vetted by InnVision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local&amp;id=8325617|title=Boy wants people to pass extra food to hungry|date=August 24, 2011|work=KGO-TV|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nonprofit was founded by Kiran Sridhar, then a 12-year-old 7th grader at a Bay Area school, as a way to improve the distribution of food and reduce waste. Sridhar, now a sophomore at Stanford University, still heads the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wastenofood.org/who-we-are|title=Who We Are|work=Waste No Food website|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste No Food was initially focused in the [[Silicon Valley]] area and has been expanded to [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2012/04/01/bay-area-teen-takes-innovative-approach-to-helping-the-hungry/|title=Bay Area Teen Takes Innovative Approach To Helping The Hungry|last=Sovern|first=Doug|date=April 1, 2012|work=CBS San Francisco|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
