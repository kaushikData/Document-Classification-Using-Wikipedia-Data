The event "The America's Cup" would not be founded until 1857, when the [[Deed of Gift of the America's Cup|deed of gift]] established the America's Cup racing regattas.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The 1851 edition was a [[fleet race]], unlike modern America's Cups finals, which are currently [[match race]]s.

==History==
The race originated with an invitation for [[The Great Exhibition|the Great Exhibition of 1851]] by the [[Earl of Winton]], then Commodore of the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] (RYS), inviting the recently formed [[New York Yacht Club]] (NYYC) to enjoy the facilities of the clubhouse of the RYS. John Cox Stevens, Commodore of the NYYC responded positively, and anticipated racing. Due to the RYS rules of the time, other races in the 1851 RYS Regatta were restricted to RYS members and their self-owned yachts, so the '''R. Y. S. £100 Cup''' was established, open to anyone to enter. At a RYS meeting on 9 May 1851, the race was scheduled for 22 August 1851. This race was to be the first of a series of challenge races for successive £100 Cups. At the time, it was normal practise for the winners to own the cups that were won, and not to return them for the next race to be won by others.&lt;ref name=RYS-America/&gt;&lt;ref name=AC-LRbar-RYSracing&gt; {{cite web |url= http://land-rover-bar.americascup.com/en/royal.html |title= Royal Yacht Squadron Racing |work= Land Rover Bar |publisher= America's Cup }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Trophy==
{{main|RYS £100 Cup}}
The trophy, worth 100 [[Sovereign (British coin)|sovereign]]s in 1851, latterly affectionately known as the '''Auld Mug''', distinguishing it from the racing regatta of the same name.&lt;ref name=BoatDusseldorfISAF2003history/&gt;

The trophy, a bottomless [[ewer]], is made out of {{convert|134|oz|kg|abbr=on}} of [[silver]], and is {{convert|27|in|cm|abbr=on}} tall. The ewer was a stock item obtained from jeweler Robert Garrard in 1848.&lt;ref name=RYS-America/&gt;&lt;ref name=AC-LRbar-RYSracing/&gt;

After the race it was engraved with the names of the yachts that raced against America, save the runner-up, ''Aurora''.&lt;ref name=RYS-America/&gt;

==Race==
The regatta, held on 22 August 1851,&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; raced clockwise around the [[Isle of Wight]] in a [[fleet race]].&lt;ref name=BoatDusseldorfISAF2003history/&gt; The course was called "The Queen's Course".&lt;ref name=RYS-America/&gt; The course was near [[Cowes Castle]] on the Isle of Wight, where the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] headquarters are located.&lt;ref name=AC-LRbar-RYSracing/&gt; The race took place as part of the ''1851 Royal Yacht Squadron Regatta''.&lt;ref name=RYS1851RegattaPromo&gt; {{cite |title= Royal Yacht Squadron Regatta, 1851 |publisher= Royal Yacht Squadron |date= 1851 |type= poster }} &lt;/ref&gt; The signal gun for sailing was fired at 10am, and the winner saluted by a gun from the flag-ship at 8:34pm (8:37pm [[railway time]]).

18 yachts were entered for the race, but only 15 yachts started the race. The yacht ''Fernande'' did not make the start, while ''Strella'' and ''Titania'' both got to the starting line, though did not start the race. Those yachts that raced were ''America'', ''Alarm'', ''Arrow'', ''Aurora'', ''Bacchante'', ''Beatrice'', ''Brilliant'', ''Constance'', ''Eclipse'', ''Freak'', ''Gipsy Queen'', ''Ione'', ''Mona'', ''Volante'', and ''Wyvern''.&lt;ref name=RYS-America/&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{main|America's Cup}}
The trophy would be renamed "[[America's Cup]]" after the [[America (yacht)|yacht ''America'']], that won the trophy. In 1857, the competition for "America's Cup" was declared, with the creation of the [[Deed of Gift of the America's Cup|deed of gift]]. The [[1870 America's Cup|first challenge]] would take place in 1870 under the deed of gift. This would initiate the oldest championship in sport.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

The '''1995 Caribbean Series''' (''Serie del Caribe'') was the twenty-fifth edition of the second stage of the [[Caribbean Series]]. It was held in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] from February 3 to February 9. The series featured four teams from [[Dominican Republic]], [[Mexico]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Venezuela]]. The hometown team, the [[Senadores de San Juan]] of the [[Professional Baseball League of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican League]] won the series. The team was managed by [[Luis Meléndez (baseball)|Luis Meléndez]]. The [[Caribbean Series Most Valuable Player|Most Valuable Player]] was [[Roberto Alomar]], a second baseman with the [[Senadores de San Juan]].

While the San Juan club had faced difficulty in emerging as the champions of the [[Professional Baseball League of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican Winter League]], the team swept its way through the six-game Series by a 49-15 score. The [[Azucareros del Este]] of the [[Dominican Winter Baseball League|Dominican League]] lost one game 16-0 by Puerto Rico. However they won all of their games against the other teams thanks to the arms of [[José Rijo]], [[Pedro Martínez]] and [[Pedro Astacio]] to place second with a 4-2 record.

Puerto Rico was helped by having many major leaguers who normally would have taken off the time for [[spring training]]. [[Roberto Alomar]] (.560, 10 RBI, 9 R, .840 SLG, 2 SB) was the Series MVP and he was helped by [[Bernie Williams]] (.417, .875 SLG), [[Juan González (baseball)|Juan González]] (.375, .667 SLG), [[Edgar Martínez]] (.375, 9 RBI), [[Carlos Baerga]], [[Rubén Sierra]], a young [[Carlos Delgado]] hitting cleanup, [[Roberto Hernández (relief pitcher)|Roberto Hernández]], [[Rey Sánchez]] (.333), [[Doug Brocail]] (1-0, 1.00), [[José Alberro]] (1-0, 0.00 in 4 games), [[Eric Gunderson]] (1-0, 1.13), [[Ricky Bones]] and [[Chris Haney]] (2.45) among others. Sanchez had won the Puerto Rican Winter League batting title but batted 9th with the superb lineup in front of him.

[[Image:Remains of the stadium at Nikopolis.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The stadium of Nikopolis at present]]
In [[Ancient Roman religion|Ancient Roman religious tradition]], '''Actia''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''{{lang|grc|Ἄκτια}})'' was  a festival of [[Apollo]], celebrated at [[Nicopolis]] in [[Epirus]], with [[wrestling]], musical contests, [[horse racing]], and sea battles. It was reestablished by [[Augustus]], in commemoration of his [[Battle of Actium|victory]] over [[Mark Antony]] off [[Actium]] in 31 BC; that it was probably the revival of an ancient festival is suggested by the celebrated temple of Apollo at Actium, which is mentioned by [[Thucydides]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', i.29&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Strabo]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Geographica (Strabo)|The Geography]]'', vii p325&lt;/ref&gt; and which was enlarged by Augustus. The games instituted by Augustus were celebrated every four years (''{{lang|grc|πενταετηρίς}}'', ''[[ludi]] quinquennales''); they received the title of a sacred ''[[agon]]'' and were also called [[Ancient Olympics in various places|Olympia]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''The Geography'' l.c.; [[Dio Cassius]], ''Roman History'', li.1; [[Suetonius]], ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'', "Life of Augustus", 18; [[Philipp August Böckh|Böckh]], ''Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum'', No. 1720, p845; J.H. Krause, ''Olympia'', p221.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadium of Nikopolis==

This ancient stadium was located in the so-called 'Proasteion' ([[sacred grove]]) of the Graeco-Roman city of Nikopolis. Together with the nearby gymnasion, theatre and hippodrome it was the location of the famous Actian Games. These games, which featured athletic, equestrian and musical events, were first held in 27 BCE to celebrate the victory of the first Roman emperor Augustus over his adversaries, Marc Antony and his Egyptian wife [[Cleopatra]]. They were held every four years up to the mid-3rd century CE.

Dating from just after the city's foundation, the ancient stadium of Nikopolis has two semicircular ends (''sphendones''), typical of the amphitheatre type that was in use during the first 200 years of the principate. The stadiums of ancient Laodikeia (near Pamukkale, Turkey) and Aphrodisias (Geyre, Turkey) have a similar architecture.

The north side of the stadium, which must have held a capacity of at least 10,000 spectators, was built on the side of a hill, while artificial deposits were used for the other sides. The walls were made of a rubble core faced with several courses of bricks. On the west side of the stadium were three apsidal entrances leading to the gymnasion, the central one larger than the others. The entrances in the ''sphendone'' at the east led to the theatre nearby. On the ''sphendone'' at the south side there were residential rooms and facilities for athletes and spectators (inns, shops, lodgings etc.)

Locals call this stadium ''to karavi'', meaning 'the ship', which of course relates to the structure's shape. Archaeological investigations are still regularly undertaken in and around the stadium today.

'''[[Aruba]]''' first competed at the '''[[Olympic Games]]''' in [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], and has participated in each [[Summer Olympic Games]] since then.  Aruba has yet to win any Olympic medals.

Between 1952 until 1984, Aruban athletes competed as part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. This arrangement changed, when Aruba became a separate entity ("land") of Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1986. The [[Aruban Olympic Committee]] was formed in 1985 and recognized in 1986. As of 2017, Aruba had not competed in any [[Winter Olympic Games]].

The '''Futurity Stakes''', commonly referred to as the '''Belmont Futurity''', is an American [[Thoroughbred horse racing|Thoroughbred horse race]] run annually in mid-September or October at [[Belmont Park]] in [[Elmont, New York]], [[United States]]. Open to two-year-old horses, it is raced on turf over a distance of six [[furlong|furlongs]].

The creation of James G. K. Lawrence, president of the [[Sheepshead Bay Race Track]], the Futurity was originally run with the two-year-old offspring of [[mare|mares]] which had been nominated before their birth. This rule remained in effect until 1957, when the race was opened to all two-year-old horses.

The Futurity was run as a [[grass|turf]] race for the first time in 2018. It was added to the [[Breeders' Cup Challenge]] series for 2018 as a "Win and You're In" qualifier for the [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint|Juvenile Turf Sprint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Breeders’ Cup Adds Three Juvenile Turf Sprint Qualifiers |url=http://www.thoroughbreddailynews.com/breeders-cup-adds-three-juvenile-turf-sprint-qualifiers/ |website=Thoroughbred Daily News |date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inaugural running==
The first edition of the Futurity took place on [[Labor Day]] in 1888. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that one quarter of those in attendance were women. The richest race ever run in the United States to that time, the owners of winner [[Proctor Knott (horse)|Proctor Knott]] collected $41,675. Until 1956, this race had a larger purse than that of the [[Belmont Stakes]].

===Food consumption===
''The New York Times'' reported that attendance for the day of the inaugural running was at least the equal of the largest crowd to ever attend a race at the Sheepshead Bay facility and that the caterer sold the following food:
{{div col|colwidth=25em}}
* 12,000 pounds of [[lobster]]
* 600 soft shell [[crab]]s
* 500 gallons of [[clam chowder]]
* 960 [[chicken]]s
* 18,000 [[sandwich]]es
* 50 sets of [[Ribs (food)|ribs]]
* 60 [[short loin]]s
* 20 [beef] hips and [[Loin#Loins in butchery|loins]]
* 25 [[Lamb and mutton|Spring lamb]]s
* 480 [[Domestic pigeon|squabs]]
* 5 barrels of [[whiskey]]
* 40 cases of pepper whiskey
* 250 kegs of [[lager]]
* 380 cases of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]
* 30 barrels of imported [[ginger ale]]
* 600 boxes of [[Club soda|soda water]], [[Sarsaparilla (soft drink)|sarsaparilla]], and other soft drinks
{{div col end}}

The Futurity Stakes was hosted by the Sheepshead Bay Race Track until the track's closure following a statewide ban on [[parimutuel betting]] through enactment of the [[Hart–Agnew Law]] by the [[New York State Legislature|New York Legislature]]. It was switched to the [[Saratoga Race Course]] for 1910 but was not raced for the next two years until the State Legislature lifted the ban. Held at Saratoga in 1913 and 1914, it was them moved to [[Belmont Park]]. In 1959 and 1960, plus from 1962 to 1967, the race was hosted by the [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] before returning to Belmont Park where it has since remained.

The race's counterpart on [[grass|turf]] is the [[Laurel Futurity]] at [[Laurel Park Racecourse]] in [[Laurel, Maryland]]. Prior to the advent of the [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile]], the Belmont Futurity was one of the United States' most important dirt races for two-year-olds. Some of the greatest Thoroughbreds in American racing history have won the race including [[Colin (horse)|Colin]], [[Native Dancer]], [[Man o' War]] and [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing#United States Triple Crowns|U.S. Triple Crown]] champions, [[Affirmed]], [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]], and [[Citation (horse)|Citation]].

In 2001, the race had been scheduled to be run on September 16 but was canceled following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]].

Over the years the race has been contested at various distances:
* 6 furlongs: 1888–1891, 1902–1924, 2011–present;
* 1,263 yards and 1 foot: 1892–1901;
* Approximately 7 furlongs: 1925–1933;
* 6.5 furlongs: 1934–1975;
* 7 furlongs: 1976–1993; 2005–2009.

'''Belmont Park''' is a major [[Thoroughbred]] horse-racing facility in the [[Northeastern United States|northeastern]] [[United States]], located in {{nowrap|[[Elmont, New York]],}} just east of the {{nowrap|[[New York City]]}} limits. Opened {{Years or months ago|1905}} on May 4, 1905, it is operated by the non-profit [[New York Racing Association]], as are [[Aqueduct Racetrack|Aqueduct]] and [[Saratoga Race Course]].  The group was formed in 1955 as the Greater New York Association to assume the assets of the individual associations that ran Belmont, Aqueduct, Saratoga, and the now-defunct [[Jamaica Racetrack]].

Belmont Park is typically open for racing from late April through mid-July (known as the Spring meet), and again from mid-September through late October (the Fall meet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 NYRA Media Guide|url=https://www.nyra.com/uploads/wysiwyg/assets/uploads/2017_MediaGuide-History.pdf|website=nyra.com|accessdate=7 June 2017|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely-known as the home of the [[Belmont Stakes]] in early June&lt;!--June 5-11--&gt;, regarded as the "Test of the Champion", the third leg of the [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]].

Along with Saratoga in [[Upstate New York|Upstate]] New York, [[Keeneland]] and [[Churchill Downs]] in [[Kentucky]], and [[Del Mar Racetrack|Del Mar]] and [[Santa Anita Park|Santa Anita]] in [[California]], Belmont is considered one of the elite racetracks in [[North America]].

The race park's main dirt track has earned the nickname, "the Big Sandy," given its prominent overall dimensions {{nowrap|({{convert|1+1/2|mi}})}} and the deep, sometimes tiring surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoppert|first1=Melissa|title=Belmont Park, Site of Failed Triple Crowns, Requires an Army of Caretakers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/sports/belmont-stakes-site-of-failed-triple-crowns-requires-an-army-of-caretakers.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=7 June 2017|date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belmont is also sometimes known as "The Championship Track" because almost every major champion in racing history since the early 20th century has competed on the racecourse – including all of the Triple Crown winners.

Belmont hosted its largest crowd in [[2004 Belmont Stakes|2004]], when 120,139 saw [[Smarty Jones]] upset by [[Birdstone]] in its Triple Crown bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Media Guide |url=http://www.nyra.com/saratoga/mediaguide/09MG_History_Section.pdf |accessdate=2011-04-11 |year=2009 |publisher=New York Racing Association |page=7 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608081555/http://www.nyra.com/saratoga/mediaguide/09MG_History_Section.pdf |archive-date=2011-06-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Old Belmont Park===
[[August Belmont, Jr.]] and [[William Collins Whitney]], along with other investors, built the original Belmont race track which opened on May 4, 1905. In its first 15 or so years, Belmont Park featured racing clockwise, in the "English fashion"—allowing the upper-class members of the racing association and their guests to have the races finish in front of the clubhouse, just to the west of the grandstand. (A "field stand," at what was then the top of the stretch, was located east of the grandstand). The original finish line was located at the top of the present-day homestretch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1905/05/04/archives/belmont-park-opens-today-with-big-race-metropolitan-handicap-is.html|title=Belmont Park Opens To-Day|date=May 4, 1905|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-10-15|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1925 book, "The Big Town", [[Ring W. Lardner]] refers to the then-recent directional change, when he has a character at Belmont say (speaking of a recent race) "At that time, they run the wrong way of the track, like you would deal cards".

The current grandstand, Thoroughbred racing's largest, was completed in 1968 after five years of renovations to the Belmont complex.]]The old clubhouse was torn down in the 1950s, along with the Manice Mansion—the turreted 19th-century homestead that served as the headquarters of Belmont's Turf and Field Club.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
--&gt;
A later innovation was created by [[Joseph E. Widener]], who took over track leadership when August Belmont II died in 1924: the Widener Chute. It was a straightaway of just under {{convert|7|furlong|km}} that cut diagonally through Belmont's training and main tracks, hitting near the quarter-pole of the main track; the course was removed in 1958.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

There are presently two features of Old Belmont Park remaining today. First is the display of four stone pillars on [[Hempstead Turnpike]], a gift from the mayor and park commissioners of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. The pillars had stood at the entrance of the Washington Course of the South Carolina Jockey Club in Charleston, which operated from 1792 to 1882. The stone pillars are now found at the clubhouse entrance. Lesser known-but more visible-are the racing motif iron railings seen partially bordering the walking ring.  The railings, used as decoration on the south side of the old Belmont grandstand, were salvaged during the 1963 demolition.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The original Belmont Park was not only unprecedented in its size, but also had the then-new innovation of a [[Long Island Rail Road]] extension from the [[Queens Village (LIRR station)|Queens Village]] station, running along the property, tunneling under Hempstead Turnpike, then terminating on the south side of the property. The [[Belmont Park (LIRR station)|train terminal]] was moved to its present location north of the turnpike after the 1956 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/05/26/archives/belmont-at-halfway-point-in-600000-rebuilding-opens-meet-wednesday.html|title=Belmont, at Halfway Point in $6,00,000 Rebuilding, Opens Meet Wednesday|last=Sisto|first=Ernest|date=May 26, 1957|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the railroad terminal was yet ''another'' track—Belmont Park Terminal, a steeplechase course operated by United Hunts until 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1927/11/05/archives/united-hunts-meet-will-begin-today-six-races-three-on-the-flat-and.html|title=United Hunts Meet Will Begin Today|date=November 27, 1927|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-10-15|page=S11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to racing history, Belmont Park made history in another industry native to the Hempstead Plains – [[aviation]]. Some 150,000 people were drawn to the track in 1910 on October 30, at the climax of a [[Wright Brothers]]-staged international aerial tournament, which had started eight years earlier. The event came at the beginning of a period (1910, 1911, and 1912) in which racing was outlawed in New York State.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Eight years later, Belmont and aviation were reunited when the racetrack served as the northern point of the first U.S. [[air mail]] route, between the New York area and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Long Island Aircraft Crashes: 1909-1959|last=Stoff|first=Joshua|publisher=Arcadia|year=2004|isbn=0-7385-3516-8|series=Images of America|location=Portsmouth, NH|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, two displays in the clubhouse of the current Belmont Park commemorate the history of the racetrack: a long mural by [[Pierre Bellocq]] featuring the dominant jockeys, trainers and racing personalities of the track's history; and a series of paintings of Old Belmont Park that were featured at a nearby restaurant before the eatery closed.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

=== Later history ===
The last race at the old Belmont Park was run in October 1962. The following spring, NYRA Chairman James Cox Brady announced that two separate engineering surveys found the grandstand/clubhouse was unsafe due to age-induced structural defects and needed to be rebuilt. The book ''Belmont Park: A Century of Champions'' noted the comment of NYRA President Edward T. Dickinson: "When you sighted down the stands, you could see some of the beams were twisted. They were in something of an S-shape."{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The old structure was demolished in 1963. The new grandstand was built 1964–1968. (The Inner Turf Course was also added during this time.) The Belmont race meetings were moved to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in [[Ozone Park, Queens|South Ozone Park]], [[Queens]], during that time.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The new $30.7 million Belmont Park grandstand, designed by [[Arthur Froehlich]], was opened May 20, 1968 and is the largest in Thoroughbred racing. It has a total attendance capacity of more than 100,000, with the adjoining backyard being able to accommodate more than 10,000. The seating portion totals nearly 33,000. (Ironically, the smaller, more cramped Churchill Downs grandstand has more seats than Belmont, 51,000.) Unlike Churchill and [[Pimlico Race Course|Pimlico]], Belmont does not allow paying spectators to picnic in the infield.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Expansion plans===
In May 2007, reports surfaced suggesting that then New York Governor [[Eliot Spitzer]] was considering closing Aqueduct Racetrack, which is ten miles west of Belmont in [[Ozone Park, New York]], and turning Belmont into a nearly year 'round race track when the New York Racing Association lease for all three of New York State's tracks expired at the end of 2007. According to the plans being discussed, Belmont's stands would be heated, additional barns built for Aqueduct's 400 horses, and the track modified to accommodate winter racing. In addition, video lottery machines would be introduced. A new entity would operate Belmont from fall to spring while the New York Racing Association would operate Saratoga Race Course in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Finley |first=Bill |title=Spitzer Is Said to Be Weighing a Track Overhaul That Would Close Aqueduct |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 20, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/nyregion/20racing.html |accessdate=2009-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any plans the former governor might have had for the track alignment likely left office with him when Spitzer was forced to resign amid [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal|a prostitution scandal]] in March 2008.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In July 2017, New York State officials announced that vacant parking lots behind the Belmont grandstand had been put to tender for two area top-level professional sports teams: the [[New York Islanders]], an [[National Hockey League|NHL]] professional hockey team; and [[New York City FC]], an [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] soccer team. Both teams were unhappy with their current locations (the Islanders at [[Barclays Center]]; New York City FC [[Yankee Stadium]]) and proposed to redevelop the land into their own stadiums. The Islanders proposed an 18,000 seat sports arena, 435,000 square feet for retail development, a 225-room hotel, and a 10,000-sq ft community center, while NYCFC's pledge included a 26,000 seat soccer ground, 400,000 sq ft for retail, a 5.2 acre community park, and 2 acre soccer complex: both proposals were fully privately funded and included improved parking and LIRR facilities as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=New Islanders Hockey Arena Suggested For Belmont Park | website=CBS New York | date=2017-07-11 | url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/07/11/new-islanders-hockey-arena-suggested-for-belmont-park/ | access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] announced that the Islanders project had won approval to be built, and the [[Belmont Park Arena]] will be opened in time for the 2020-21 hockey season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's official: New York Islanders heading back to Nassau County|url=http://abc7ny.com/sports/its-official-islanders-heading-back-to-nassau-county/2803176/|website=ABC7 New York|accessdate=December 20, 2017|date=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belmont Park Redevelopment-Conditional Designation of New YorkArena Partners (“NYAP”) as Developer|url=https://esd.ny.gov/sites/default/files/rfp/Selection%20Committee%20Recommendation%20.pdf|website=esd.ny.gov|accessdate=December 20, 2017|date=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the New York City FC proposal was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Draper | first=Kevin | last2=Kreda | first2=Allan | title=Islanders Are Expected to Win Right to Build New Arena at Belmont Park | website=The New York Times | date=2017-10-10 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/sports/islanders-belmont-park.html | access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Important races==
===Belmont Stakes===
The Belmont Stakes was named after financier and sportsman [[August Belmont, Sr.]], who helped fund the race, and most sources say the racetrack itself was also named for him. Other sources say Belmont Park was named in honor of his son—[[August Belmont, Jr.|August Belmont II]], a key member of the Westchester Racing Association, which established the racecourse.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The race was first run in 1867 at [[Jerome Park Racetrack]] in the Bronx. In 1937, the wrought iron gates that bore an illustration of that first Belmont Stakes were donated to the track by August Belmont II's sole surviving son, Perry Belmont. The gates are now on the fourth floor of Belmont Park's clubhouse.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The Belmont Stakes races have been run at Belmont Park since 1905, with the exceptions of 1911–12, when gambling was banned in New York State; and the 1963–67 editions, held at Aqueduct while the grandstands at Belmont Park were reconstructed. The first post parade in the [[United States]] was at the 14th Belmont, in 1880.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

[[File:Secretariat statue.jpg|thumb|A statue of Secretariat stands in the middle of the walking ring]]
[[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]]'s finishing time in his [[1973 Belmont Stakes|1973]] Belmont victory (2 minutes, 24 seconds) set a world record for {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km}} on dirt,&lt;ref name=hinthmkg&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1973/06/18/614651/history-in-the-making |magazine=Sports Illustrated |last=Tower |first=Whitney |title=History in the making |date=June 18, 1973 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a world record which still stands. The 31-length victory clinched the first Triple Crown in 25 years, dating back to [[Citation (horse)|Citation]] in [[1948 Belmont Stakes|1948]].  A statue of Secretariat is in the center of the Belmont paddock.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Another Belmont Stakes achievement is recognized by the "Woody's Corner" display in the first-floor clubhouse lobby, commemorating the five consecutive Belmont Stakes winners trained by [[Woody Stephens]] from 1982 to 1986&lt;!--[[1982 Belmont Stakes|1982]] to [[1986 Belmont Stakes|1986]]--&gt;.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Other memorable performances in Belmont Park history include the opening of the track in 1905 with the famous [[tie (draw)|dead heat]] between [[Sysonby]] and Race King in the [[Metropolitan Handicap|Met Cap]].  In 1923, Belmont Park was host to an international duel between the [[United States|American]] and [[England|English]] champions: [[Zev (horse)|Zev]], winner of the [[Kentucky Derby]], against Papyrus, winner of [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]].  Zev won by five lengths in front of the biggest crowd for a match race in a hundred years.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Belmont Park was the site of the tragedy-marred victory of [[Foolish Pleasure]] over champion filly [[Ruffian (horse)|Ruffian]] in a 1975 match race.  Ruffian broke down during the race and had to be euthanized; she is buried near the finish line in the infield at Belmont Park, her nose pointed towards the finish pole.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The racetrack was also the site of [[Affirmed]]'s epic stretch duel with [[Alydar]] in the [[1978 Belmont Stakes|1978]] Belmont Stakes, a victory that gave Affirmed the Triple Crown; and Triple Crown winner [[Seattle Slew]]'s defeat of Affirmed in the [[Marlboro Cup Invitational Handicap|Marlboro Cup]] in September of that same year. The Marlboro, a key event of the Fall Championship meets in the 1970s and 1980s, included a dramatic come-from-behind win by [[Forego]] in the 1976 installment.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Officials of the New York Racing Association made a concerted effort to boost attendance on Belmont Stakes Day after the 1995 installment drew only 37,171. In 1997, NYRA and local officials put together the Long Island Belmont Stakes Festival—featuring parades, food fests and other events in surrounding communities to promote the big race.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The effort succeeded in creating a buzz around the Belmont Stakes apart from the chance of seeing a Triple Crown. The [[2000 Belmont Stakes|2000]] and [[2001 Belmont Stakes|2001]] Belmonts—both run when there was no Triple Crown on the line—drew announced crowds of 67,810 and 73,857. The Belmont Stakes Festival continues to be held in communities near the track, such as Floral Park and Garden City. In [[2004 Belmont Stakes|2004]], a record attendance of 120,139 was on hand to see if [[Smarty Jones]] would be the first Triple Crown winner since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2009|title=Media Guide|url=http://www.nyra.com/saratoga/mediaguide/09MG_History_Section.pdf|publisher=New York Racing Association|page=7|accessdate=2009-08-23|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230164306/http://nyra.com/saratoga/mediaguide/09MG_History_Section.pdf|archive-date=2009-12-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Pharoah]] won the [[2015 Belmont Stakes|2015]] Belmont Stakes on June 6, and became the first [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|Triple Crown]] winner in 37 years. It was announced before the race that attendance would be capped at 90,000. That year's [[2015 Kentucky Derby|Kentucky Derby]] and [[2015 Preakness Stakes|Preakness]] both set attendance records, over 170,000 and 130,000 respectively.

=== Early aviation tournaments ===
Belmont Park also has a history of early aviation shows and tournaments that [[Aviation in the pioneer era|dates back to the early 1900s]].

[[Harriet Quimby]], the first USA woman to obtain a pilot's license, learned of the excitement of flight at the Belmont Park International Aviation Tournament on Long Island, New York in 1910 where she met famed aviator [[John Moisant]] and his sister.&lt;ref&gt;Jill W. Tallman (2 August 2011). "Thanks, Harriet". ''AOPA Pilot''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Woman in trousers daring aviator; Long Island folk discover that miss Harriet Quimby is making flights at Garden City", ''The New York Times'', page 6, May 11, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Quimby wins air pilot license", ''The New York Times'', page 7, August 2, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other key races at Belmont ===
In addition to the Belmont Stakes, other major races held at Belmont have included the [[Jockey Club Gold Cup]], the [[Woodward Stakes]], the [[Suburban Handicap]] and the Memorial Day standby—the [[Metropolitan Handicap]], also known as the "Met Mile."  (NYRA moved the Woodward to Saratoga Race Course,  in 2006.){{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Two important races for fillies, the [[Mother Goose Stakes]] and the [[Coaching Club American Oaks]], are also run at Belmont as the first two installments of the New York Racing Association's Triple Tiara series for fillies. The third is the [[Alabama Stakes]], run at Saratoga. In years past, the New York Filly Triple Crown consisted of the Mother Goose, CCA Oaks and another Belmont race, the [[Acorn Stakes]] (which is still run at the track).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

All of the above races are contested on dirt; notable turf (grass) races include the [[Belmont Derby]], [[Belmont Oaks]], [[Manhattan Handicap]], [[Just A Game Handicap]], [[Bowling Green Handicap]], [[Man O' War Stakes]], [[Flower Bowl Invitational Stakes]] and the [[Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Belmont's Fall Championship meet includes New York Showcase Day in late October, with seven stakes races for New York-bred horses. The richest race on that program is the $250,000 [[Empire Classic Handicap]].

==Belmont Park today==

[[File:Belmont9 1999-05.jpg|thumb|left|Horses and lead ponies in a pre-race post parade at Belmont. The race track was the site of the first post parade in the United States.]]

Racing at Belmont Park is conducted in two annual installments, or "meetings": The "spring-summer meeting," which usually begins on the second Wednesday in May and lasts through the fourth Sunday in July, followed by a "fall meeting" commencing on the Friday after [[Labor Day]] and ending the fourth Sunday in October.  Racing is held at [[Saratoga Race Course]],  during the time between these two meetings.  Prior to 1977 a summer meeting was contested at Aqueduct from mid-June until the Saratoga meet began; its abolition led to the Belmont spring meeting being lengthened to its present duration (and eventual renaming).

The autumn installment is known as the Fall Championship meet, since many of the eventual Eclipse Award title winners have earned key victories in some of the meeting's races, such as the [[Jockey Club Gold Cup]]. Before the advent of the [[Breeders' Cup]] series in the mid-1980s, the Belmont Fall Championship races themselves helped determine the divisional championships.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Belmont has been home to the daylong Breeders' Cup championship in 1990, 1995, 2001 (the first major sports event to be held after the [[September 11 Attacks]] in the metropolitan area) and most recently in 2005.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Belmont's backyard is well known as a gathering place for racing fans to see their horses saddled before they hit the track. The center of the paddock is dominated by a white pine that predated the track itself—it turned 180 years old in 2006. A stylized version of the pine has been the centerpiece of Belmont Park's corporate logo since 1968.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

[[File:Belmont2 1999-05.jpg|thumb|The "Woody's Corner" display in the first-floor clubhouse lobby commemorates the five consecutive Belmont Stakes winners trained by Woody Stephens from 1982 to 1986.]] The paddock area also serves as a picnic area for the increasing numbers of fans who make Belmont Stakes Day—the Saturday that falls within the range of June 5 through June 11—a tourist attraction.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Physical attributes ==
[[File:Belmont8 1999-05.jpg|thumb|right|Horses race down the stretch on Belmont Park's main track, nicknamed "Big Sandy" by owners, trainers, jockeys and fans. The main track is the longest dirt racecourse in North American thoroughbred racing—at {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km}}.]]

The {{convert|430|acre|ha|sing=on}} racing, training and barn complex is located on the western edge of the Nassau County region known as the Hempstead Plains. Just a few miles (kilometers) east on the same plains, the first racing meet in North America was held in 1665, supervised by colonial governor Richard Nicolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1073752/index.htm|title=Point Of Fact - A Thoroughbred racing quiz to test the ingenuity and add to the knowledge of the $2 bettor and the armchair expert|last=Ryan|first=Pat|date=April 30, 1962|magazine=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dirt racecourse, known officially as the ''Main Track'' and nicknamed "Big Sandy" by racing followers, has a circumference of {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km}}, the longest dirt thoroughbred racetrack in North America. Immediately inside of this is the ''Widener Turf Course'' (named after the Widener family that has a long and prestigious history in American horse racing) spanning {{convert|1+5/16|mi|km}} plus {{convert|27|ft|m}}, which in turn encircles an ''Inner Turf Course'' with a circumference of {{convert|1+3/16|mi|km}} plus {{convert|103|ft|m}}.  On the Main Track, it is {{convert|1097|ft|m}} from the top of the stretch to the finish line, and the segment between the wire and the start of the first (clubhouse) turn covers {{convert|843|ft|m}}; this latter segment is shorter by approximately {{convert|165|ft|m}} on both of the turf courses, in order to accommodate the two [[chute (racecourse)|chutes]] that exist on the Widener Turf Course, from which turf races of {{convert|1|mi|km}} and {{convert|1+1/16|mi|km}} are started; an additional chute exists for races of {{convert|1+1/16|mi|km}} on the Inner Turf Course.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

A straightaway chute leads on to the backstretch of the Main Track and permits races on the dirt up to {{convert|1+1/8|mi|km}} long to be run with one turn. The chute used to extend further back across the training track, permitting races of up to a mile and a quarter, but was shortened because a crossover is now infeasible given the clay base of the Main Track and stone-dust base of the training track. Before the 1990 Breeders' Cup, the outer rail of the Main Track was moved back to widen the middle of the clubhouse turn and soften the angle of the start of the {{convert|1+1/4|mi|km}} [[Breeders' Cup Classic|Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/24/sports/belmont-s-layout-bringing-controversy-to-cup-classic.html|title=Belmont's Layout Bringing Controversy to Cup Classic|last=Crist|first=Steven|date=October 24, 1990|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The training track is {{convert|1|mi|km}} in circumference and abuts the east end of the main track. In March 2009, lights were added to the training track as a safety measure to prevent early morning workouts from occurring in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.drf.com/news/article/102360.html|title='Michele' rewards owners' persistence|last=Grening|first=David|date=March 19, 2009|newspaper=Daily Racing Form|accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geopolitical status ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
The racetrack, grandstand, training, and barn facilities are located entirely in the community of [[Elmont, New York|Elmont]] in [[Nassau County, New York]].  According to the City of New York's own map portal, the [[Belmont Park (LIRR station)|Long Island Rail Road station]] on the property, the ramp between the grandstand and the train station, and some of the adjoining parking fields straddle the [[Queens|Queens County]] line.

Belmont Park has direct on- and off-ramps to the [[Cross Island Parkway (New York)|Cross Island Parkway]], which runs north-south and is just to the west of the park.  Belmont Park's physical address is given as 2150 Hempstead Turnpike ([[New York State Route 24]]).

The Belmont Park property originally totaled some {{convert|650|acres|km2}}. Because the property stretched slightly into Queens, bookmakers in the track's early days—when bookmaking was illegal—could escape arrest from one county's authorities by jumping over the border. It was once even believed that horses rounding the far turn crossed into Queens and then came back to Nassau for the stretch run. After the 1956 season, the construction of a wider bus road beyond the main course's final turn forced the turn to be shortened. According to the Belmont publication commemorating the track's 1968 reopening, that move cut {{convert|96|ft|m}} off its circumference. The current layout has the entire racing course inside Nassau County.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Belmontsam May 1999.jpg|thumb|left|NYRA bugler Sam Grossman plays "Call to the Post," heralding the horses as they enter the track before a race at Belmont Park.]]

===Belmont and NYRA TV personalities===
Because of Belmont's role hosting big, nationally televised races on broadcast and cable TV, its track announcers have been among the best known in the sport. Among the famous race callers who've served as Belmont PA announcers are [[Fred Capossela]], [[Dave Johnson (announcer)|Dave Johnson]], [[Chic Anderson]], [[Marshall Cassidy]], [[Tom Durkin]], and present voice [[Larry Collmus]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Contrary to popular belief, Johnson, not Anderson, was Belmont Park's '''PA''' announcer during Secretariat's 1973 romp in the Belmont Stakes. It was on TV that Anderson called the 1973 Belmont Stakes aired by [[CBS]] Television, where he famously described Big Red as "moving like a tremendous machine". Anderson was the TV "voice of horse racing" in the 1970s and the announcer at [[Churchill Downs]] during [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]]'s racing career. Johnson went on to be TV's voice of horse racing in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Anderson would succeed Johnson as announcer at Belmont and the other NYRA tracks in May 1977, serving until his death on March 24, 1979. Anderson was followed by frequent backup voice Marshall Cassidy, who was the lead caller of NYRA races until Durkin replaced him in September 1990.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

'''Camogie''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑː|m|ɔː|g|iː}}; {{lang-ga|camógaíocht}}) is an Irish stick-and-ball team sport played by women; it is almost identical to the game of [[hurling]] played by men. Camogie is played by 100,000 women in Ireland and worldwide, largely among Irish communities.&lt;ref name="Moran 2011 460"&gt;{{cite book | last = Moran | first = Mary | authorlink = Mary Moran (camogie) | title = A Game of Our Own: The History of Camogie | publisher = Cumann Camógaíochta | year = 2011 | location = Dublin, Ireland | pages = 460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==The game==
The game consists of 2 thirty-minute halves. There is a half time interval of 10 minutes. In event of extra time halves must consist of 10 minutes each. Each team has 15 players on the field. Within the 15 players the team must consist of 1 goal keeper, 3 full back players, 3 half back players, 2 centre-field players, 3 half forward players and 3 full forward players. There is a minimum requirement of 12 players on the pitch at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.camogie.ie/files/Administration+Section/Playing+Rules+2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116004430/http://www.camogie.ie/files/Administration+Section/Playing+Rules+2014.pdf |archivedate=16 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Field===
The field is not of a fixed size, but must be between 130m long by 80m wide, and 145m long by 90m wide.

===Goals and scoring===
{{Main|Scoring in Gaelic games}}
H-shaped goals are used. A team achieves a score by making the ball go between the posts. If the ball goes over the bar for a "point", the team earns 1-point. If the ball goes under the bar for a "goal", the team earns a 3-points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camogie.ie/AboutCamogie/CamogiePlayingRules/tabid/59/Default.aspx|title=Rules of Camogie on Camogie.ie website|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profile of camogie==
The annual [[All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship|All Ireland Camogie Championship]] has a record attendance of 33,154&lt;ref name="Irish Examiner"&gt;2007 All Ireland final reports in [http://www.examiner.ie/archives/2007/0910/sport/gaa-chiefs-vow-to-review-ticketing-system-following-glitch-42143.html Irish Examiner], [https://archive.is/20120802093242/http://www.independent.ie/other/wexfords-day-of-glory-1074735.html Irish Independent], [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2007/0910/1189076008095.html Irish Times] and [http://www.goreyguardian.ie/sport/other-sports/leacy-goals-fire-wexford-to-emotional-victory-1079990.html Gorey Guardian] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219153020/http://www.goreyguardian.ie/sport/other-sports/leacy-goals-fire-wexford-to-emotional-victory-1079990.html |date=19 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while average attendances in recent years are in the region of 15,000 to 18,000.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
The rules are almost identical to [[hurling]], with a few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camogie.ie/AboutCamogie/CamogievHurlingRuleDifferences/tabid/60/Default.aspx|title=Rule Differences on Camogie.ie website|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Goalkeepers wear the same colours as outfield players. This is because no special rules apply to the goalkeeper and so there is no need for officials to differentiate between goalkeeper and outfielders.
*A camogie player can handpass any  score from play ''(handpassing a goal is forbidden in hurling since 1980)''
*Camogie games last 60 minutes, two 30-minute halves ''(senior inter-county hurling games last 70, which is two 35-minute halves)''. Ties are resolved by multiple 2×10-minute [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] extra time periods; in these, the first team to score wins.
*Dropping the [[camogie stick]] to handpass the ball is permitted.
*A smaller sliotar (ball) is used in camogie – commonly known as a size 4 sliotar – whereas hurlers play with a size 5 sliotar.
*If a defending player hits the sliotar wide, a 45-metre puck is awarded to the opposition ''(in hurling, it is a 65-metre puck)''
*After a score, the goalkeeper pucks out from the 13-metre line. ''(in hurling, he must puck from the end line)''
*The metal band on the camogie stick must be covered with tape. ''(not necessary in hurling)''
*Side-to-side charges are forbidden. ''(permitted in hurling)''
*Two points are awarded for a score direct from a sideline cut (since March 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/ladies-sticking-with-skirts-as-oflynn-backs-rules-makeover-3066426.html|title=Ladies sticking with skirts as O'Flynn backs rules makeover - Independent.ie|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Camogie players must wear [[skirt]]s or [[skort]]s rather than [[shorts]].

==Foundation==
Experimental rules were drawn up in 1903 for a female stick-and-ball game by [[Máire Ní Chinnéide]], [[Seán (Sceilg) Ó Ceallaigh]], [[Tadhg Ó Donnchadha]] and [[Séamus Ó Braonáin]]. The Official Launch of Camogie took place with the first public match between Craobh an Chéitinnigh (Keatings branch of the [[Gaelic League]]) and [[Cúchulainns]] on 17 July at a Feis in Navan. The sport's governing body, the Camogie Association or [[Camogie Association of Ireland|An Cumann Camógaíochta]] was founded in 1905 and re-constituted in 1911, 1923 and 1939. Until June 2010 it was known as Cumann Camógaíochta na nGael.

Máire Ní Chinnéide and Cáit Ní Dhonnchadha, two prominent Irish-language enthusiasts and cultural nationalists, were credited with having created the sport, with the assistance of Ní Dhonnchadha's scholarly brother Tadhg Ó Donnchadha, who drew up its rules. Thus, although camogie was founded by women, and independently run (although closely linked to the GAA), there was, from the outset, a small yet powerful male presence within its administrative ranks. It was no surprise that camogie emanated from the Gaelic League, nor that it would be dependent upon the structures and networks provided by that organisation during the initial expansion of the sport. Of all the cultural nationalist organisations for adults that emerged during the fin de siècle, the Gaelic League was the only one to accept female and male members on an equal footing.&lt;ref&gt;Ríona Nic Congáil “'Looking on for centuries from the side-line': Gaelic Feminism and the rise of Camogie", Éire-Ireland (Spring / Summer 2013): 168–192.[https://www.academia.edu/3324668/Looking_on_for_centuries_from_the_side-line_Gaelic_Feminism_and_the_rise_of_Camogie Gaelic Feminism and the rise of Camogie]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camogie Team, Waterford, 17 October 1915.jpg|thumb|A camogie team pictured in Waterford in October 1915]]

==Historic rules==
Under [[Séamus Ó Braonáin]]'s original 1903 camogie rules both the match and the field were shorter than their hurling equivalents. Matches were 40 minutes, increased to 50 minutes in 1934, and playing fields 125–130 yards (114-119m) long and 65–70 yards (59-64m) wide. From 1929 until 1979 a second crossbar, a "points bar" was also used, meaning that a point would not be allowed if it travelled over this bar, a somewhat contentious rule through the 75 years it was in use. Teams were regulated at 12 a side, using an elliptical formation (1–3–3–3–1) although it was more a "squeezed lemon" formation with the three midfield players grouped more closely together than their counterpart on the half back and half-forward lines. In 1999 camogie moved to the GAA field-size and 15-a-side, adopting the standard GAA butterfly formation (3–3–2–3–3).

==Nomenclature==
The name was invented by [[Tadhg Ó Donnchadha|Tadhg Ua Donnchadha]] (Tórna) at meetings in 1903 in advance of the first matches in 1904.

Men play using a curved stick called in Irish a ''camán''. Women would use a shorter stick, at one stage described by the diminutive form ''camóg''. The suffix -''aíocht'' (originally "uidheacht") was added to both words to give names for the sports: ''camánaíocht'' (which became ''iománaíocht'') and ''camógaíocht''. When the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] was founded in 1884 the English-origin name "hurling" was given to the men's game. When an organisation for women was set up in 1904, it was decided to anglicise the Irish name ''camógaíocht'' to ''camogie''.&lt;ref name="Moran 2011 460"/&gt;

==Structure==
[[Camogie Association|An Cumann Camógaíochta]] has a similar structure to the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], with an Annual Congress every spring which decides on policy and major issues such as rule changes, and an executive council, the Árd Chómhairle which deals with short-term issues and governance. The game is administered from a headquarters in [[Croke Park]] in Dublin. Each of 28 [[Gaelic Athletic Association county|county board]]s takes control of its own affairs (all of the Irish counties except [[Fermanagh GAA|Fermanagh]], [[Leitrim GAA|Leitrim]] and [[Sligo GAA|Sligo]]), with the number of clubs ranging from 58 in [[Cork GAA|Cork]] to one in [[Leitrim GAA|Leitrim]]. There are four provincial councils and affiliates in [[Asia GAA|Asia]], [[Australia GAA|Australia]], [[Britain GAA|Britain]], [[Europe GAA|Europe]], [[New York GAA|New York]], [[New Zealand GAA|New Zealand]] and [[North American GAA|North America]].

==Camogie clubs==
There are 537 camogie clubs, of which 513 (95.5%) are based on the island of Ireland, 47 in [[Connacht GAA#Camogie|Connacht]] (8.8%), 195 in [[Leinster GAA#Camogie|Leinster]] (36.4%), 160 in [[Munster GAA#Camogie|Munster]] (29.8%), and 110 in [[Ulster GAA#Camogie|Ulster]] (20.5%).

'''Cessna Stadium''' is a 24,000 seat stadium in [[Wichita, Kansas]], United States.  It is located on the south side of 21st Street, east of Hillside, on the campus of [[Wichita State University]] in northeast Wichita.

Cessna is currently the home of the [[Wichita State University#Shockers|Shocker]] [[track and field]] team.  Before the WSU football program was discontinued, the Shocker [[Wichita State Shockers football|football]] team played home games at this stadium.

==History==
In the early days of Wichita State University, when it was known as Fairmount College, its first football field was located on the north side of 17th Street, immediately east of the current Henrion Hall, when it was the Henrion Gymnasium.  In 1929, concrete bleachers were attached to the east side of the same building for football games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wichita.edu/thisis/buildingtour/?tour_sysid=32 Henrion Hall; Wichita State University.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, the school decided to build a new football stadium on the north side of campus at the current site on the south side of 21st Street.  On January 6, 1941, ground was broken for '''Veterans Field''', and by September 1942 the bowl was excavated, foundations were poured for the west stands, and a quarter of the west bleachers were completed, however construction was halted due to metal shortages during [[World War II]].  After the war ended, the bleachers were constructed in sections over time as funds were incrementally available.  By mid-1946, stands were completed to a point where 6,000 seats were ready by the start of the 1946 football season.  Veterans Field was finally completed before the start of the 1948 football season, with 15,000 seats and facilities for the press, concessions stands, and locker rooms.  It was dedicated on November 25, 1948 during a football game with the [[University of Nevada]].  The stadium was dedicated to the members of the armed forces from Sedgwick County who served in World War II.&lt;ref name="NewspaperNotes-FootballStadium"&gt;[http://specialcollections.wichita.edu/collections/local_history/tihen/pdf/People&amp;Places/Veterans_Field.PDF Notes from Wichita newspapers about Veterans Field and Cessna Stadium; Dr. Edward N. Tihen; Wichita State University.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VeteransFieldHistory"&gt;[http://www.wichita.edu/thisis/stories/story.asp?si=1273 Wichita State to celebrate Veterans Field on Veterans Day; November 1, 2010; Wichita State University.]&lt;/ref&gt;

1n 1967, Wichita State started considering the expansion of Veterans Field.  In 1968, faculty and students voted and approved the expansion by adding on top of the existing stands of Veterans Field.  [[Cessna Aircraft Company]] pledged a donation of $300,000 for the proposed stadium, and it was renamed to Cessna Stadium.  The cost of the expansion was $1.5 Million, and the school had a fund drive to raise the remaining money.  Construction was started on February 7, 1969 and completed in September. It was one of the most modern and complete football facilities in the nation at the time of its completion.&lt;ref name="NewspaperNotes-FootballStadium"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wichita.edu/thisis/buildingtour/?tour_sysid=14 Cessna Stadium; Wichita State University.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wichita State University rededicated the facility on April 16, 2002 to mark the end of the seven-month, $1.3 million construction that included adding an eighth lane and resurfacing the track, reconfiguring the infield event layout, and building separate locker rooms for the Shocker men's and women's track and field teams. The first event in the renovated facility was WSU's annual K.T. Woodman Track and Field Classic, which is scheduled every April.

The '''Debrecen Swimming Pool Complex''' is an aquatics venue in [[Debrecen]], Hungary. The facility features a competitive long course pool, a warm up pool, a training pool, Jacuzzi, sauna and an outdoor thermal bath with a water temperature of 34–36 °C (93–97 °F). The 50 metres long course pool can be reduced to 33 metres or 25 metres by a mobile wall, making it available for short course events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportuszoda.hu/bemutatkozas.html|title=Bemutatkozás|trans-title=Introduction|publisher=Debrecen Swimming Pool Complex official website|accessdate=24 March 2012|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the pool began in October 2005 and took 11 months to complete. It was opened in October 2006 with a three-day-long inauguration festival, that included water polo matches and swimming competitions. The opening ceremony featured [[Tamás Gyárfás]], president of the Hungarian Swimming Association and [[Lajos Kósa]], mayor of Debrecen, while the [[ribbon-cutting ceremony]] was carried out by five time Olympic champion [[Krisztina Egerszegi]].&lt;ref name=inauguration&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epulettar.hu/cikk/haromnapos-uszodaavatas|title=Háromnapos uszodaavatás|trans-title=Three day long pool inauguration|publisher=Épülettár|date=16 October 2006|accessdate=24 March 2012|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major event held in the venue was the [[2007 European Short Course Swimming Championships]], which was followed by a number of national and international swimming and water polo competitions. In February 2012, after [[Antwerp]] withdrew from organizing the swimming events [[2012 European Aquatics Championships]], Debrecen stepped in as the new host and the races are now set to take place at the pool complex between 21–27 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swimnews.com/news/view/9208|title=Euros: Debrecen &amp; Eindhoven Not Antwerp|publisher=Swimnews|date=16 February 2012|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Latvia national rugby union team''' represents [[Latvia]] at the sport of [[rugby union]]. They are governed by Latvijas Regbija federācija (Latvia Rugby Federation) and have been playing international rugby since the early 1990s. Rugby has increased in popularity in Latvia recently due to a rise in form. Despite minimal playing numbers, Latvia continue to compete at a high level, and had an outside chance of finishing top of [[2006-2008 European Nations Cup Second Division|Division 2A]] of the [[European Nations Cup (rugby union)|European Nations Cup]]. However their hopes took a massive blow, when they failed to capitalise on [[Poland national rugby union team|Poland's]] surprise home defeat to [[Croatia national rugby union team|Croatia]], losing 16-13 to [[Malta national rugby union team|Malta]] in [[Paola, Malta|Paola]]. Latvia is an improving rugby team as now more players are playing in Russia, Germany, and Canada.

'''Lightning football''' is a shortened variation of [[Australian rules football]], often played at half of the duration of a full match.

Lightning football is typically used as a means to accommodate a small tournament inside a single day or weekend, particularly at junior or amateur level; these tournaments are generally known as '''lightning premierships''' or '''lightning carnivals'''. At the top level of Australian rules football, lightning matches have most recently been staged as part of the [[Australian Football League pre-season competition]].

Lightning football is distinct from [[AFLX]], a different shortened variation of Australian rules football. Lightning football is not significantly different from standard Australian rules football other than the length of its games, while AFLX is a heavily modified variant played with on a smaller field with fewer players.

==Name==
The use of the word ''lightning'', as a synonym for "fast", to describe an Australian rules football tournament appears to have originated with the first lightning carnival staged by the [[South Australian National Football League]] (SANFL) in 1940.&lt;ref name="names" /&gt; The term may have been adopted from its use in [[chess]], which had used the word ''lightning'' in the same context for many years: "[[fast chess|lightning chess]]" tournaments were seen in Australia from as early as 1909, and were played under modified rules in which players were allowed at most ten seconds to make each move, allowing an entire tournament to be completed in just a few hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chess and Draughts: gathering of players an interesting function|date=15 July 1909|page=9|newspaper=The West Australian|publication-place=Perth, WA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a preview of the 1940 SANFL Lightning Carnival, ''[[the Advertiser (Adelaide)|the Advertiser]]'' journalist Jim Handby discussed the suitability of the name; while he surmised that the choice of name was primarily due to the short time over which the premiership was decided, he speculated that the shortened matches could lead to a particularly high-paced style of gameplay.&lt;ref name="names"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Advertiser|publication-place=Adelaide, SA|first=Jim|last=Handby|page=14|date=12 July 1940|title=Prospects in Lightning Premiership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "lightning premiership/carnival" has generally entered the Australian vernacular for a condensed carnival of shortened matches in any game or sport. The term was, for example, attributed to a 1945 South Australian seven-a-side rugby union tournament, long before the sport of [[rugby sevens]] was formally codified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Seven-a-side Rugby Lightning Premiership Tomorrow|first=Scrum|last=Half|date=10 August 1945|page=11|newspaper=The Advertiser|publication-place=Adelaide, SA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Unlike other abbreviated sports, such as [[Twenty20|Twenty20 cricket]], rugby sevens or Australian rules football's [[AFLX]], lightning football is not a strictly [[Codification (law)|codified]] sport in its own right. In many cases, the length of the game is the only difference in the rules between the full and lightning versions of the game; in other cases, some rules are modified for lightning matches.

Most commonly, lightning matches are played at half of the length of a regulation game. In the most recent lightning matches in the [[Australian Football League|Australian Football League (AFL)]] [[Australian Football League pre-season competition|pre-season competition]], lightning matches are played over two halves, each lasting 20 minutes with [[time on (Australian rules football)|time on]], compared with the normal match length of four quarters each lasting 20 minutes with time-on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/tabid/6038/default.aspx?newsid=125487|title=NAB Cup Fixture Released|date=26 Oct 2011|accessdate=15 Dec 2011|publisher=Port Adelaide Football Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this varies from tournament to tournament, and the length is often simply adjusted based on the number of games required to be played and the time available to play them in.

In more recent incarnations of lightning football organised by the AFL, several experimental rules, many designed to speed up the game, have been trialled. The most notable variation was the introduction of a free kick paid against the last player to touch the ball before it goes out of bounds (except from a spoil or smother), rather than restarting play with a boundary throw-in; this rule was used in the AFL's [[1996 AFL Lightning Premiership|1996]] and [[2011 NAB Cup|2011]] lightning matches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php/20101214212055410|title=NAB Cup 2011 new rule trials|date=14 Dec 2010|accessdate=15 Dec 2011|publisher=World Footy News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as revised in [[2012 NAB Cup|2012]] to penalise a player only if the last touch was a kick, handpass, or crossing the line while in possession of the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/tabid/208/default.aspx?newsid=126473 |publisher=Australian Football League |title=New rules for NAB Cup |date=24 Nov 2011 |accessdate=15 Dec 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119100029/http://www.afl.com.au/tabid/208/default.aspx?newsid=126473 |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history===
The concept of holding a one-day tournament of shortened Australian rules football matches dates as early as the 19th century. During a weekend's break in the [[1896 VFA season|1896 VFA premiership season]], a [[1896 VFA season#Charity Cup|Charity Cup]] event was held in which four clubs – {{AFL Ess}}, {{AFL Col}}, {{AFL SM}} and [[Port Melbourne Football Club|Port Melbourne]] – contested a knock-out tournament of shortened matches; as is the case in modern lightning premierships, new rules were trialled during the event.&lt;ref name="ccdetails"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=2 June 1896|title=Football|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
Lightning premierships saw an increase in frequency around World War II, when many such events were staged as wartime fundraisers. The first occurred during 1940, the first football season following the outbreak of [[World War II]]. On 13 July 1940, the SANFL staged its "Lightning Football Carnival" at the [[Adelaide Oval]], attracting a crowd of almost 17,500 people, with [[Sturt Football Club|Sturt]] victorious; the carnival was an eight-team knock-out tournament, with each match played over two periods of 14 minutes each.&lt;ref name="1940advertiser"&gt;{{cite news |author=Rover|title=Lightning Football Carnival raises more than £1000 for patriotic and charitable funds|newspaper=The Advertiser|date=15 July 1940|page=7|publication-place=Adelaide, SA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Victorian Football League]] then staged its version, known as the [[1940 VFL Lightning Premiership|"Patriotic Premiership"]], on 3 August 1940, at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], attracting more than 30,000 people, and won by {{AFL Stk}}; this was a twelve-team knock-out tournament, with each match lasting a single period of 20 minutes.&lt;ref name="1940argus"&gt;{{cite news|first=Percy|last=Taylor|title=Unique competition|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=2 August 1940|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both tournaments were considered great successes, and both leagues held further wartime Lightning Premierships in 1941 and 1943.

In addition to the sport's two biggest leagues, the [[Tasmanian Football League|Tasmanian Australian National Football League]] (TANFL) held two wartime Lightning Premierships, both in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Examiner|publication-place=Launceston, TAS|date=8 Sep 1941|page=7|title=Second Lightning Premiership in South}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many smaller leagues also held events. Most notably, the [[Broken Hill Football League]], staged a "Patriotic Premiership" on 6 July 1940, one week before the inaugural SANFL event, which consisted of a four-team knock-out tournament, with matches played at just under half-length (two periods of twenty minutes without time-on).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Barrier Miner|publication-place=Broken Hill, NSW|title=Carnival success at Western Oval|page=1|date=6 July 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post World War II===
In the ten years following World War II, most of the major Australian rules football leagues sporadically held lightning premierships. Although there was no longer a war to fund, the events were still held as charity fundraisers. The SANFL was the most active proponent of lightning football, staging four post-war carnivals between 1946 and 1950;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |page=3|newspaper=Williamstown Chronicle|title=Lightning Premiership|publication-place=Williamstown, VIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; the VFL staged lightning premierships on public holidays in [[1951 VFL Lightning Premiership|1951]] (Jubilee Day), [[1952 VFL Lightning Premiership|1952]] (Empire Day) and [[1953 VFL Lightning Premiership|1953]] (Coronation Day); and post-war lightning premierships were also staged by the [[Victorian Football Association]] (1946),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Williamstown Chronicle|publication-place=Williamstown, VIC|date=5 July 1946|page=2|title=Williamstown win lightning premiership}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[North Western Football Union]] (1951)&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Mercury|date=2 July 1951|publication-place=Hobart, TAS|title=Lightning Premiership Won By Ulverstone|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the TANFL (1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Examiner|date=17 March 1953|title=Lightning N.T.F.A. Premiership|page=15|publication-place=Launceston, TAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1950s, lightning football has been seen only occasionally at the top levels of the sport. Specific events have included:
*[[1971 Rothmans Channel 7 Cup|1971]]: the Rothmans Channel 7 Cup, an eight-team knockout tournament of half-length games played over one weekend in October 1971. The tournament was staged in Perth as a testimonial to [[Polly Farmer]], and featured four [[West Australian Football League]] teams and two teams each from the SANFL and VFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/rothmans_channel_7_cup.htm |title=1971 Rothmans Channel 7 Cup |first=John |last=Devaney |publisher=Fullpointsfooty |accessdate=12 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607084929/http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/rothmans_channel_7_cup.htm |archivedate= 7 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1972 – 1979: the VFA staged a post-season lightning premiership among teams from both divisions that failed to reach the finals. The shortened matches were played as curtain-raisers to the finals, rather than as a condensed tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-118-0-0-0&amp;sID=54554&amp;&amp;news_task=DETAIL&amp;articleID=11104596&amp;sectionID=54554|publisher=Sportingpulse|title=History of the VFL 1877 - 2009|accessdate=12 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[1996 AFL Lightning Premiership|1996]]: the AFL staged a pre-season lightning premiership over a weekend in February 1996 to celebrate the league's [[1996 AFL season|Centenary Season]]. Matches were played over two halves of 17.5 minutes duration, and this was the first Lightning Premiership to trial some of the more experimental rules currently associated with the lightning format.
*[[2011 NAB Cup|2011]] to [[2013 NAB Cup|2013]]: the AFL staged lightning matches in the first round of the annual [[NAB Cup|pre-season competition]]. The league's eighteen teams competed in six separate [[Round-robin tournament|rounds robin]] of three teams each, with each set of three matches played consecutively at one venue. In 2011, the lightning round was used to eliminate ten of the eighteen teams from the competition; in 2012, the lightning matches counted as two of each team's four scheduled pre-season competition matches.
*2011: at the [[2011 Australian Football International Cup]], a round of lightning matches (in the form of six rounds robin of three teams each) was staged at the start of the tournament, and the results were used to separate the twelve stronger countries and the six weaker countries into separate divisions for the remainder of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootynews.com/staticpages/index.php/International_Cups|title=Australian Football International Cups|date=16 Sep 2011|accessdate=15 Dec 2011|publisher=World Footy News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lightning football at lower levels===
Among the more notable senior lightning football events around Australia are:
*The Ngurratjuta Lightning Carnival, which has been held every year since the 1980s over the Easter long weekend in [[Alice Springs]]. The Ngurratjuta Lightning Carnival attracts teams from all over the Northern Territory, including from remote indigenous communities, and is the biggest football event in the [[Red Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/red-hearts-stronger-pulse/story-e6frexx0-1226047344419|title=Red heart's stronger pulse|first=Sam|last=Edmund|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=15 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Boag's Draught Pre-season Invitational, which is a pre-season lightning premiership played among the previous year's premiers from each of Greater Melbourne's eight metropolitan football leagues (the [[Eastern Football League (Australia)|EFL]], [[Essendon District Football League|EDFL]], [[Geelong Football League|GFL]], [[Northern Football League (Australia)|NFL]], [[Riddell District Football League|RDFL]], [[Southern Football League (Victoria)|SFL]], [[Victorian Amateur Football Association|VAFA]] and [[Western Region Football League|WRFL]]). First staged in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sunbury-leader.whereilive.com.au/sport/story/riddell-forced-to-take-on-favourites/ |title=Riddell forced to take on favourites |date=1 Mar 2011 |accessdate=15 Dec 2011 |first=Patrick |last=O'Meara |newspaper=Sunbury Leader |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423122756/http://sunbury-leader.whereilive.com.au/sport/story/riddell-forced-to-take-on-favourites/ |archivedate=2012-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual lightning carnivals have become common in many junior leagues and school competitions. This is not limited to Australian rules football, with many other sports contested under a lightning premiership format.

The '''Occidental Mindoro Sports Complex''' is a [[track and field]] venue in [[San Jose, Occidental Mindoro|San Jose]], [[Occidental Mindoro]].

==Background==
The Occidental Mindoro Sports Complex was built inside the grounds of the Pedro T. Mendiola Sr. Memorial National High School. It was inaugurated in March 2018 by local officials led by San Jose Mayor Romulo Festin along with provincial officials of [[Occidental Mindoro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ribbon cutting and blessing of sports complex |url=http://sanjoseoccidentalmindoro.com/Img.aspx?key=87 |accessdate=11 June 2018 |publisher=Municipal Government of San Jose |date=10 March 2018|language=Filipino}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hosted the MIMAROPA Regional Athletic Association Week which had its opening ceremony on March 12, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MIMAROPA Meet Opening Program |url=http://sanjoseoccidentalmindoro.com/Img.aspx?key=92 |accessdate=11 June 2018 |publisher=Municipal Government of San Jose |date=12 March 2018|language=Filipino}}&lt;/ref&gt; The province of Occidental Mindoro last hosted the event in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MIMAROPA ‘Palaro’ back in Mindoro after 48 years |url=http://conceptnewscentral.com/index.php/2018/03/13/mimaropa-palaro-back-in-mindoro-after-48-years/ |accessdate=11 June 2018 |work=Concept Central |date=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's grandstand has a seating capacity of 2,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Occidental Mindoro gears up for hosting of MIMAROPA regional athletic meet next month |url=http://bicol.politics.com.ph/2018/02/24/occidental-mindoro-gears-hosting-mimaropa-regional-athletic-meet-next-month/ |accessdate=11 June 2018 |work=Politiko Bicol |date=24 February 2018|language=English, Filipino|quote=Ang Occidental Mindoro Sports Complex Grandstand ay may sitting capacity na dalawang libo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overtraining''' occurs when a person exceeds their body's ability to recover from strenuous [[exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stretchcoach.com/articles/overtraining/|title=Overtraining - Learn how to identify Overtraining Syndrome|last=Walker|first=Brad|website=stretchcoach.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overtraining can be described as a point where a person may have a decrease in performance and plateauing as a result of failure to consistently perform at a certain level or training load; a load which exceeds their recovery capacity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Overtraining: A Review of the Signs, Symptoms and Possible Causes|last = Stone|first = M|date = 1991|journal = Journal of strength and conditioning research|doi = 10.1519/00124278-199102000-00006|pmid = |volume=5|pages=35–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who are overtrained cease making progress, and can even begin to lose [[Physical strength|strength]] and [[physical fitness|fitness]]. Overtraining is also known as chronic fatigue, burnout and overstress in athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Peluso, M., &amp; Andrade, L. (2005). Physical activity and mental health: the association between exercise and mood.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Listed below are some of the common effects and cited signs of overtraining.&lt;ref name=ncbigov-signs /&gt;&lt;ref name=acefitness /&gt;&lt;ref name=acsm&gt;{{cite web|title=Overtraining with Resistance Exercise|url=http://www.acsm.org/docs/current-comments/overtrainwithresistance.pdf|publisher=American College of Sports Medicine|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overtraining and Osteoporosis|url=http://www.webmd.com/osteoporosis/overtraining-and-osteoporosis?page=2|publisher=WebMD, LLC|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overtraining may be accompanied by one or more concomitant symptoms:&lt;ref name=ncbigov-signs&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=MB|last2=Thiese|first2=SM|title=A review of overtraining syndrome-recognizing the signs and symptoms.|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|date=1992|volume=27|issue=4|pages=352–4|pmid=16558192|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1317287/pdf/jathtrain00036-0066.pdf|accessdate=25 June 2014|pmc=1317287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=acefitness&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Signs You're Overtraining|url=http://www.acefitness.org/updateable/update_display.aspx?pageID=634|publisher=The American Council on Exercise|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note the difference between overtraining and over-reaching; over-reaching is when an athlete is undergoing hard training but with adequate recovery, overtraining however, is when an athlete is undergoing hard training without the adequate recovery. With over-reaching, the consequential drop in performance can be resolved in a few days or weeks.&lt;ref&gt;http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1997-36577-000. Kreider et al, 1998 (overtraining in sport)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance ===
* Early onset of fatigue
* Decreased [[VO2 max|aerobic capacity]] (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max)
* Poor physical performance
* Inability to complete workouts
* Delayed recovery

It is also important to remember that the effect of overtraining is not isolated only to affecting the athlete's athletic ability but it can have implications on other areas of life such as performance in studies or the work force. An overtrained athlete who is suffering from physical and or psychological symptoms could also have trouble socialising with friends and family, studying for an exam or prepping for work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Overtraining in sport|publisher = Human Kinetics|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Like pharmacological drugs, physical exercise may be chemically [[Behavioral addiction|addictive]].  Addiction can be defined as, the frequent engaging in the behavior to a greater extent or for a longer time period than intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goodman A | year = 1990 | title = Addiction: definition and implications | url = | journal = Addiction | volume = 85 | issue = 11| pages = 1403–1408 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1990.tb01620.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mitchell A | year = 2007 | title = Confronting Addiction Across Disciplines | url = | journal = Philosophy, Psychiatry, &amp; Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 233–236 | doi = 10.1353/ppp.2007.0016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is theorized that this addiction is due to natural [[endorphin]]s and [[dopamine]] generated and regulated by the exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15438629809512532 |title=Exercise dependence: A review of its manifestation, theory and measurement |year=1998 |last1=Adams |first1=Jeremy |last2=Kirkby |first2=Robert |journal=Research in Sports Medicine |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=265–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether strictly due to this chemical by-product or not, some people can be said to become addicted to or fixated on psychological/physical effects of physical exercise and fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3810/psm.2005.06.101 |title=The Obligatory Exerciser: Assessing an Overcommitment to Exercise |year=2005 |last1=Draeger |first1=John |last2=Yates |first2=Alayne |last3=Crowell |first3=Douglas |journal=The Physician and Sportsmedicine |volume=33 |issue=6 |pmid=20086364 |pages=13–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may lead to overexercise, resulting in the "overtraining" syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Exercise Motivational Triggers |first=Dave R. |last=Baldwin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YnoEdRqG_nQC&amp;pg=PA53 |page=53 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=978-0-595-21603-1 |date=2002-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==

A number of possible mechanisms for overtraining have been proposed:
* [[Microtrauma]] to the [[muscle]]s are created faster than the body can heal them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/icb/journal/v78/n5/full/icb200070a.html|title = Overtraining effects on immunity and performance in athletes|last = MacKinnon|first = Laurel|date = 30 May 2000|journal = Immunology &amp; Cell Biology|doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1711.2000.t01-7-.x|pmid = |access-date = 12 April 2015|volume=78|pages=502–509}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Amino acid]]s are used up faster than they are supplied in the diet. This is sometimes called "[[protein deficiency]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1550-2783-3-1-42.pdf|title = Protein and Overtraining: Potential Applications for Free-Living Athletes|last = Lowery, &amp; Forsythe|first = Lonnie, &amp; Cassandra|date = April 19, 2006|journal = International Society of Sports Nutrition|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Systemic inflammation]] which results in the release of [[cytokine]]s activating an immune response&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2000/02000/Cytokine_hypothesis_of_overtraining__a.11.aspx|title = Cytokine hypothesis of overtraining: a physiological adaptation to excessive stress?|last = Smith|first = Lucille|date = November 1999|journal = Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==

Allowing more time for the body to recover:
* Taking a break from training to allow time for recovery.&lt;ref name=hss&gt;{{cite web|title=Overtraining|url=http://www.hss.edu/conditions_overtraining.asp|publisher=Hospital for Special Surgery|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reducing the volume and/or the intensity of the training.
* Suitable [[Sports periodization|periodization]] of training.&lt;ref name=rice&gt;{{cite web|title=Overtraining Syndrome|url=http://www.rice.edu/~jenky/sports/overtraining.html|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Splitting the training program so that different sets of muscles are worked on different days.&lt;ref name=hss /&gt;
* Increase [[sleep]] time.
* Deep-tissue or sports [[massage]] of the affected muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/34/2/109.full|title = Effects of massage on physiological restoration, perceived recovery, and repeated sports performance|last = Hemmings, Smith, Graydon, &amp; Dyson|first = Brian, Marcus, Jan,&amp; Rosemary|date = 28 October 1999|journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine|doi = 10.1136/bjsm.34.2.109|pmid = |access-date = 12 April 2015|volume=34|pages=109–114|pmc = 1724183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Self-massage or rub down of the affected muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/34/2/109.full|title = Effects of massage on physiological restoration, perceived recovery, and repeated sports performance|last = Hemmings, Smith, Graydon, &amp; Dyson|first = Brian, Marcus, Jan, and Rosemary|date = 28 October 1999|journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine|doi = 10.1136/bjsm.34.2.109|pmid = |access-date = 12 April 2015|volume=34|pages=109–114|pmc = 1724183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Short sprints with long resting time once the athlete is able to continue with light training&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Diet ===
* Ensuring that calorie intake at least matches expenditure.&lt;ref name="hss" /&gt;
* Ensuring total calories are from a suitable [[macronutrient]] ratio.&lt;ref name="hg-reco-tips"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/15765/1/Overtraining-Recovery-Tips.html|title=Overtraining Recovery Tips|publisher=Health Guidance|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Addressing [[vitamin]] deficiencies with [[nutritional supplements]].&lt;ref name="hss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hg-reco-tips" /&gt;

== Prevention ==
Seeing as there are many non beneficial results of overtraining and the main treatment is taking time out to rest, so to avoid taking time off training prevention is very important for many athletes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An additional method preferred by many collegiate and professional level athletes is the incorporation of active recovery into training. The gradual varying of intensity and volume of training is an effective way to prevent overtraining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Overtraining in elite athletes|last = Kuipers|first = |date = 1988|journal = Sports Medicine|pmid = |last2 = Keizer|issue = 2|volume = 6| doi = 10.2165/00007256-198806020-00003 |pages=79–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The athlete should be closely monitored by keeping records of weight, diet and heart rate and the training program should be adjusted in accordance to different physical and emotional stresses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Along with the recording of rest, diet, weight and heart rates, there are multiple training types that can assist with ensuring that over training is not occurring.

Interval training ensures that, even though they are short, rest periods during training are taken. The “periods of high intensity and low intensity” &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Preventing overtraining in athletes in high-intensity sports and stress/recovery monitoring Preventing overtraining|journal=Scandinavian journal of medicine &amp; science in sports|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; mixed characteristics of interval training enable athletes to ensure they are including rest and allowing the body to rest or repair in between intervals and in between each stage of a training session.

Australian rowers “require a mix of technique, power and endurance of both the aerobic and anaerobic energy systems” &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ausport.gov.au/ais/nutrition/factsheets/sports/rowing|title=Australian rowers|last=|first=|date=|website=http://www.ausport.gov.au/ais/nutrition/factsheets/sports/rowing|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; follow a strict training schedule to enable them to ensure that rest is taken into count to ensure that overtraining is not present. “Train upwards of 11 months of the year” &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; this large volume of training is well spaced and thought out to avoid over training symptoms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22848">The '''Pan-American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship'''  is the foremost intercollegiate team chess championship in the [[Americas]]. Hosted in part by the [[United States Chess Federation]], the Pan-Am Intercollegiate is open to any team comprising four players and up to two alternates from the same post-secondary school ([[university]], [[college]], [[community college]]) in [[North America]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], or the [[Caribbean]]. The Pan-Am began as such in 1946 (there had been earlier versions open to U.S. schools only), and is held annually, usually December 27–30. It has usually been held in the United States, but was hosted in [[Canada]] four times (1969, 1971, 1984, 1999). The current format is a six-round fixed-roster team [[Swiss-system tournament]] scored by team (not individual) points. Sometimes the Pan-Am Intercollegiate is held as part of a larger event called the Pan-American Chess Championships comprising the Pan-Am Intercollegiate, Pan-Am Scholastic Team Championship, and Pan-Am Open (for any individual).

== Significance ==
For many years this tournament was, in effect, a national (or continental) championship.  For a few years in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Chess Life, Here and There | magazine=Chess Life | date=March 1973 | page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Chess Club Ties City College; Frankle Wins Singles Crown | newspaper=Harvard Crimson | date=November 28, 1972 | url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1972/11/28/chess-club-ties-city-college-frankle/ | access-date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Continental Chess Association held a rival intercollegiate tournament, but that was discontinued.  The Pan-Am should not be confused with the Campeonato PanAmericano de Ajedrez Universitario (PanAmerican University Chess Championships), which has been held since 2006 by the Confederación De Ajedrez Para America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Daniela De la Parra Wins 2013 Campeonato PanAmericano Universitario | url=http://www.utb.edu/sa/chess/Pages/News/Daniela-De-la-Parra-Wins-2013-Campeonato-PanAmericano-de-Ajedrez-Universitario.aspx | access-date=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, a separate invitational team tournament has been held:  the top four finishing US schools in the Pan-Am advance to the [[President's Cup (chess)|President's Cup]] (informally known as the "Final Four of College Chess" and typically held in the first weekend of April), which determines the US National College or University Champion.

==Organization and Rules==
The governing body for the Pan-Am is the College Chess Committee (CCC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=College Chess | url=http://www.collegechess.org/ | access-date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States Chess Federation|United States Chess Federation (USCF)]]. The CCC ratified a set of guidelines for the Pan-Am in 1992, which have been amended by various resolutions of the CCC, most recently in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Pan-American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championships: Official Tournament Rules | url=http://www.collegechess.org/2015-pan-am-rules.pdf | access-date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These rules include stringent eligibility requirements, which were overhauled in 2004.  There are also guidelines for conduct of a scholarship program.

College chess does not fall under the authority of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA). The Pan-Am is conducted under USCF rules and is rated both by USCF and [[FIDE]].

At the 2012 Pan-Am, the CCC recommended that all cash prizes at the Pan-Am Intercollegiate be eliminated and forbidden.

For many years prior to 1996, high school teams were allowed to compete in the Pan-Am Intercollegiate, though few did.

==History==
Started in 1946, the Pan-Am has been held under various names and formats. For some years in the period 1945-1974 there was an individual college championship. Following [[Bobby Fischer]]'s victory at the 1972 World Championship, the popularity of the Pan-Am temporarily soared. Beginning in the 1990s, the Pan-Am has been dominated by teams from schools offering chess scholarships.

===Intercollegiate chess before the Pan Am===

====Quadrangular Intercollegiate league====
The Quadrangular Intercollegiate league—comprising teams from [[Harvard University]], [[Yale University]], [[Columbia University]] and [[Princeton University]]—was formed in 1892, founded by Edward Caswell, Yale class of 1866. The tournament typically took place between Christmas and New Year's Day. Winners from 1892 to 1913 are as follows: Columbia 1892, 1893, 1899, 1902, 1906, 1907, 1910-1912; Harvard 1894-1898, 1903-1905; Yale 1901, 1913; Princeton 1908; tie between Harvard and Yale in 1909. In addition, Harvard and Yale played an annual team match.

During the first decade of the twentieth century, future world champion [[Jose Raul Capablanca]] represented Columbia, on first board.

====Triangular Intercollegiate league====
The Triangular Intercollegiate league—comprising teams from [[Cornell University]], [[Brown University]], and the [[University of Pennsylvania]]—was formed in 1899. Champions from 1899 to 1913 are as follows: Pennsylvania 1899, 1904, 1905, 1908, 1909, 1912, 1913; Cornell 1900-1903, 1907, 1910; tie between Pennsylvania and Brown in 1906; tie between Cornell and Pennsylvania in 1911.

In some years, all-star teams from the Quadrangular and Triangular leagues met in a challenge match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hxr7cb|title=American chess bulletin.  v.11 (1914).|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
The Pan-Am started in 1946.

However, there had been a team event for American schools only before [[World War II]]. One noteworthy result from this earlier event, from 1931–32, had [[City College of New York]] winning, with [[Reuben Fine]] on board one and [[Sidney Norman Bernstein]] on board two; the team scored 31.5 out of a possible 32 points.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bobby Fischer I Knew And Other Stories'', by [[Arnold Denker]] and [[Larry Parr (editor)|Larry Parr]], [[San Francisco]] 1995, Hypermodern Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1946 to 1964, the Pan-Am Intercollegiate Team Championship was held every even year, with a Pan-Am Intercollegiate Individual Championship held every odd year from 1945 to 1963.

American schools from the northeast and midwest regions dominated both the hosting and winning of the championship. [[Columbia University]] won three titles, the [[University of Chicago]] won two, and [[CCNY]] won two during this period. The first eight tournaments averaged about a dozen teams taking part. From 1962 to 1967, participation doubled to an average of about 25 teams per year.

===Annual competition begins===
With increased interest, annual team competition began in 1964.  In 1965, 1967, and 1969, the tournament was an individual-and-team competition, that is, players entered as individuals, but if a school had four or more players entered, the four highest of its students' scores were added to make a team score.  The 1965 event saw the first non-American winner, the [[University of Toronto]]. The first non-American school to host was [[Canada]]'s [[McGill University]] at [[Montreal]] in 1969, and McGill also won the event that year. From 1968 to 1971, interest doubled again, to nearly 50 teams per year.

===The Fischer boom===
During the 1960s and 1970s, the level of participation in the Pan-Am grew about tenfold, as one of the effects of [[Bobby Fischer]]'s chess career, culminating in the [[World Chess Championship]].  Attendance averaged nearly 108 teams per year from 1972 to 1978; the highest turnout was 123 teams (520 players) in 1975. Future [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]]s [[Larry Christiansen]] and [[Ron Henley (chess player)|Ron Henley]] (both recruited with chess scholarships) anchored the 1976 championship team from New College of the [[University of South Florida]]  Sarasota, the first southern school to win.

===Three straight titles===
The [[University of Toronto]] was the first school to win three straight outright titles, from 1980 to 1982; this feat was repeated by [[Harvard University]] from 1988-90. [[Rhode Island College]], led by former US High School Chess Champions James Thibault and Sandeep Joshi, rolled to a convincing victory in 1985. The winning 1983 team from [[Yale University]] featured 3 future US Chess Champions in [[Joel Benjamin]], [[Michael Wilder]], and Inna Izrailov.

From 1979 to 1986, an average of 57 teams took part. Future US Chess Champion [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Patrick Wolff]] led [[Yale University]] to victory in 1987. [[Harvard University]] won four titles in five years from 1986 to 1990, either won outright or shared.

Prior to 1986 the Pan Ams were organized by the Intercollegiate League of America (ICLA). The United States Chess Federation took over the organization after the 1986 Pan-Am in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].

===Kamsky plays in Pan-Am but Vivek Rao shines===
[[Chicago]] 1991 saw a reigning U.S. champion appear in the Pan-Am for the first time, when 17-year-old [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] émigré [[Gata Kamsky]], was first board for [[Brooklyn College]]. Kamsky lost a sensational game to Vivek Rao of the winning [[University of Illinois]] team. Rao had previously led Harvard in winning the 1988, 1989 and 1990 Pan Ams.

=== Chess scholarships ===
The 1990s saw two important events that influenced college chess: [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] sent a flood of very strong eastern [[Europe]]an and former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] players to the Americas, and several schools began offering major chess scholarships.

The [[University of South Florida]] offered chess scholarships in 1976 to two young players, but abandoned the experiment after winning the 1976 Pan-Am. Subsequently, [[Rhode Island College]] offered chess scholarships, and eventually won the Pan-Am in 1985. The [[Borough of Manhattan Community College|Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC)]] recruited grandmasters and eventually offered chess scholarships. BMCC won the Pan-Am in 1993, 1994, and 1997.  In contrast to those short-lived programs, the chess scholarship programs at the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County|University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)]] and the [[University of Texas at Dallas|University of Texas at Dallas (UTD)]] have taken root and continue to the present day.

In 2009, two more Texas schools fielded strong teams: [[University of Texas at Brownsville|University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB)]] and [[Texas Tech University]]; both offered chess scholarships. The 2010 Final Four was the strongest to date: it featured UMBC (average USCF rating 2559), UTD (2574), UTB (2598), and Texas Tech (2429).
In 2012, Webster University and Lindenwood have emerged as contenders.
The 2012 Pan-Am was the strongest ever:  the 44 teams included 23 grandmasters and five schools with average USCF ratings over 2500;  Webster's A and B teams were initially ranked 1 and 3.

'''Robina Stadium''', also known by its [[Naming rights|sponsored name]] '''Cbus Super Stadium''', is a rectangular [[football]] stadium in the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] suburb of [[Robina, Queensland|Robina]], [[Queensland]]. The main usage is as the home ground to the [[National Rugby League]]'s [[Gold Coast Titans]].    

Robina Stadium is also used for [[Rugby Union]], Soccer, [[Rugby Sevens]], [[Rugby League]] Test Matches and has hosted [[Rugby League World Cup]] matches. 

Construction of the venue started in 2006, and finished in February 2008, in time for the [[2008 National Rugby League season]], when it became the new home of the Titans.

==Stadium==
Robina Stadium is located in the satellite growth suburb of Robina, next to [[Robina railway station, Queensland|Robina railway station]]. The stadium is effectively a smaller version of [[Lang Park|Suncorp Stadium]] in [[Brisbane]], and was designed by the same company. The project was funded by the [[Government of Queensland|Queensland Government]]. On 27 September 2006, it was announced that the new ground would be renamed Skilled Park after [[Skilled Group]] won the naming rights to the stadium. The land for the site was purchased by the Gold Coast City Council and gifted to the Queensland Government to build the Stadium.

Sports Minister [[Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 2006-2009|Judy Spence]] announced that the new stadium will now be able to seat 27,400 people instead of 25,000. This came after workers on the site found extra space for about 2,400 seats across the stadium while construction was in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leagueheaven.b1.jcink.com/index.php?showtopic=1029&amp;st=0&amp;#entry5461 |title=Jcink.com Forum Hosting |website=Leagueheaven.b1.jcink.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robina Stadium hosted two matches in the [[2008 Rugby League World Cup]], which was held in Australia. The first saw eventual tournament champions [[New Zealand Kiwis|New Zealand]] defeat [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]] 48-6. The second, a semi-final qualifier, saw a [[Jarryd Hayne]] led [[Fiji Bati|Fiji]] defeat [[Ireland national rugby league team|Ireland]] 30-14. The ground also became host to the newly created [[A-League]] side, [[Gold Coast United FC|Gold Coast United]], starting in [[A-League 2009-10|2009-10]].

The ground first saw finals football when the Titans, in their first finals appearance, hosted the [[Brisbane Broncos]] in the first week of the [[2009 NRL season]] play-offs. This ground also witnessed finals when the Gold Coast Titans defeated the [[New Zealand Warriors]] 28-16 in the 2010 finals.

Beginning in November 2011, the stadium hosted the [[Gold Coast Sevens]], the first event in the annual [[IRB Sevens World Series]] of [[rugby sevens]]. The country's leg of the series had previously been staged in [[Adelaide Sevens|Adelaide]] in early autumn (March/April) at the [[Adelaide Oval]], but was put up for bidding upon the expiry of Adelaide's hosting contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.rugby.com.au/news/sevens/gold_coast_to_become_new_home_for_australian_seven,146138.html/news/latest/section/39652 |title=Gold Coast to Become New Home for Australian Sevens |publisher=Australian Rugby Union |date=13 April 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby.com.au/sevens/GoldCoastSevens.aspx |title=Gold Coast Sevens |work=Australian Rugby Union |accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Round 4 of the 2014 NRL season, a 3-foot brown snake invaded the stadium, now known as Cbus Super Stadium, during a match between the Titans and Queensland rivals the North Queensland Cowboys. No one was injured, with the snake remaining in the southeast corner until midway through the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/03/31/snake-slithers-nrl-contest |title=Snake slithers in to NRL contest &amp;#124; SBS News |website=Sbs.com.au |date=2014-03-31 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/gold-coast/cbus-stadium-snake-that-interrupted-titans-vs-cowboys-has-been-found-in-a-mens-urinal/story-fnj94idh-1226872557625 |title=Cbus Stadium Snake That Interrupted Titans v Cowboys Has Been Found in a Mens Urinal |website=Goldcoastbulletin.com.au |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrl.com/snake-slithers-in-to-nrl-contest/tabid/10874/newsid/77265/default.aspx |title=Snake slithers in to NRL contest |website=NRL.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the venue hosted the United Arab Emirates Football team as they prepared for the [[Asian Cup]] and it also hosted three [[Brisbane Roar]] [[Asian Champions League]] fixtures in February, March and May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-afc.com/uploads/mediakit/acl2015/acl2015-press-kit-g1.pdf |format=PDF |title=MATCH PRESS KIT : Group G – Matchday 1 : Brisbane Roar (AUS) vs Beijing Guoan (CHN); Robina Stadium, Robina |website=The-afc.com |accessdate=2016-11-13}}

'''Specialized strength exercises''' are [[physical exercise]]s used to develop the physical or psychological qualities that apply directly to a specific sport discipline. These exercises are designed and selected so that the movement and actions closely match those seen in a specific sport.&lt;ref&gt;Yessis, Michael. ''Explosive Running''. Ultimate Athlete Concepts, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized exercises that promote psychological traits consist of movements and actions that require decisiveness, willpower, perseverance and confidence to achieve specific goals.  They have similar concentration and psychological qualities as seen during [[competition]].&lt;ref&gt;Zatsiorski, Vladimir and Kramer, William.  "Science and Practice of Strength Training". Human Kinetics, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  

For example, execution of certain specialized exercises requires concentration to develop the [[neuromuscular]] pathway needed.  A [[strength exercise]] which duplicates a particular portion of a skill requires ultimate concentration and perseverance to repeat exactly the same movement time after time to develop the necessary muscle feel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Yuri V.Verkoshansky |title=Programming and Organization of Sports training |publisher=Sportiviny Press|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the specialized exercises to have maximum positive transfer an athlete must be decisive in their movements and actions in order to develop the confidence to repeat the action during competition. 

==Criteria ==

For an exercise to be specific it must fulfill one or more of the following criteria:  

#The exercise must duplicate the exact movement witnessed in certain actions of the sports skill.  For example, an exercise to duplicate the exact ankle, knee, hip or shoulder joint action.
#The exercise must involve the same type of muscular contraction as used in the skill execution.  For example, in the push-off in sprinting, the muscles undergo an explosive shortening contraction (after being pre-tensed) to produce maximum force and resultant [[running]] speed.  After the initial contraction the limb continues on its own momentum until the antagonist muscles undergo a strong lengthening (eccentric) contraction to slow down and stop the limb before an injury can occur.  The special exercise can also duplicate the speed of movement.
#The special exercise must have the same range of motion as in the skill action.  For example, in running, doing an exercise with the arm raised above the head and then pulling it downward may use the same muscles but does not duplicate the same range of muscular arm action.  More specific is to move the arm backward and upward so that it duplicates the exact range of motion which occurs in the running stride.&lt;ref&gt;Yessis, Michael. ''Build A Better Athlete''. Equilibrium Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The key to improving your performance is to do general exercises to develop a base and to then do special exercises that duplicate the movements and actions seen in the actual skills execution.  In this way the development of the physical abilities that are specific to a sport will have the greatest impact on maintaining or improving an athlete's ability to perform better.

'''Spectrum Field''' (formerly '''Bright House Networks Field''' and '''Bright House Field''') is a [[baseball]] stadium located in [[Clearwater, Florida]], in the [[United States]].  The stadium was built in 2004 and has a maximum seating capacity of 8,500 people (7,000 fixed seats with additional grass berm seating for 1,500).

The ballpark is the [[spring training]] home of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], and also the home of their Class A affiliate, the [[Clearwater Threshers]] of the [[Florida State League]].  A sculpture titled ''The Ace''—by artist Kevin Brady—stands at the ballpark's west entrance plaza.&lt;ref name=Times204&gt;{{cite news |title=A Whole New Ball Game|first=Chris|last=Tisch|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/02/27/Northpinellas/A_whole_new_ball_game.shtml|newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]|date=February 27, 2004|accessdate=March 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was originally named after the regional / national cable company, [[Bright House Networks]], whose local [[Cable television headend|head end]] center is located just to the south of the stadium.

It was announced on January 20, 2004, that [[Bright House Networks]] had secured the [[naming rights]] for the new ballpark. Under the terms of the agreement, Bright House Networks would pay the Phillies $1.7 million over 10 years with an option for two 5-year renewals. The City of Clearwater receives one-third of the payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Phillies to Play in Bright House|first=Bob|last=Putnam|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NO4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=s3gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3648,167361&amp;dq=bright-house+opening+phillies|newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]|date=January 21, 2004|accessdate=March 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the complex was renamed Spectrum Field after Bright House was purchased by [[Charter Communications]]. While named for Charter's residential service, the name invoked memories of the [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]] arena that operated from 1967 to 2009 at the [[South Philadelphia Sports Complex]], which the Phillies have called home since 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Zolecki.

==History==
[[File:BrightHouseFieldfloodJune2012.jpg|thumb|left|The flooded field caused by the rains of Tropical Storm Debby.]]
Spectrum Field is the Phillies' third Clearwater spring-training home. The team moved to Clearwater in [[1947 Philadelphia Phillies season|1947]]. They trained and played home games at [[Clearwater Athletic Field]] from [[1947 Philadelphia Phillies season|1947]] to [[1954 Philadelphia Phillies season|1954]]. The City of Clearwater opened a new ballpark for spring training in [[1955 Philadelphia Phillies season|1955]] and named it [[Jack Russell Memorial Stadium|Jack Russell Stadium]]. (The ballpark was renamed Jack Russell Memorial Stadium in 1990.) With the stadium aging, the Phillies and the city erected their new spring home adjacent to the Phillies' year-round training facility, the [[Carpenter Complex]], four-miles east of Jack Russell Memorial Stadium.

Ground-breaking of the new stadium took place on October 16, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lieberthal Surgery a Success |first=Ken |last=Mandel |url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20021016&amp;content_id=159352&amp;vkey=news_phi&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=phi |publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]] |date=October 16, 2002 |accessdate=April 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525082119/http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20021016&amp;content_id=159352&amp;vkey=news_phi&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=phi |archivedate=May 25, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official ribbon-cutting ceremony for the ballpark took place on February 27, 2004 prior to the annual spring-training Phan Fest.&lt;ref name="Times204" /&gt;

On June 24, 2012, thanks to the rain bands off [[Tropical Storm Debby (2012)|Tropical Storm Debby]], the field was flooded, becoming [[swimming pool]]-like.&lt;ref name="TSDebby"&gt;{{cite web |title=Florida Flooding Hits FSL Ballparks|url=http://www.ballparkdigest.com/201206255087/at-the-ballpark/the-front-office/florida-flooding-hits-fsl-ballparks|work=Ballpark Digest|publisher=August Publications|date=June 24, 2012|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Phillies played their first spring-training game at the park on March 4, [[2004 Philadelphia Phillies season|2004]].  8,205 fans watched the Phils beat the [[2004 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] 5–1. [[Vicente Padilla]] started for the Phillies, [[Marlon Byrd]] had the park's first hit, and [[Jimmy Rollins]] hit the first home run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Phillies Phest|first1=Eileen|last1=Schulte|first2=Bob|last2=Putnam|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/03/05/Northpinellas/Phillies_Phest.shtml|newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]|date=March 5, 2004|accessdate=March 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spectrum Field hosted the 44th Florida State League All-Star Game on June 18, 2005. A crowd of 5,547 saw the West defeat the East 6–4. The [[Sarasota Reds]]' [[Chris Dickerson (baseball)|Chris Dickerson]] hit a two-run home run, scored two runs, and earned the game's Star of Stars Award.

[[File:PressureSensitiveStartingBlocks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Pressure-sensitive starting blocks with loudspeakers. A pressure sensor will detect an early start and the loudspeakers provide the runners with the sound from the starter all at the same time.]]
'''Starting blocks''' are a device used in the sport of [[track and field]] by [[Sprint (running)|sprint]] athletes to hold their feet at the start of a race so they do not slip as they push out at the sound of the gun. For most levels of competition, including the whole of high level international competition, starting blocks are mandatory equipment for the start of sprint races.&lt;ref name="iaaf.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512013129/http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/Competitions/TechnicalArea/05/47/81/20091027115916_httppostedfile_CompRules2010_web_26Oct09_17166.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-12 |df= }} IAAF Rule 161&lt;/ref&gt; 

The invention of starting blocks is credited to Australian [[Charlie Booth]] and his father in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.athletics.com.au/news/news/2008/may/vale_charlie_booth Athletics Australia&lt;/ref&gt;  

Prior to their invention, runners would dig holes in the dirt track.  Trowels were provided at the start of races.  This was not the most consistent or stable system. It also was destructive to the track surface with the holes having to be filled for subsequent runners. When [[George Simpson (sprinter)|George Simpson]] became the first person to run 9.4 seconds for the [[100-yard dash]] in 1930, his record was disallowed because he used starting blocks.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/si/george-simpson-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood was the first material used, with some tracks having permanently placed wooden starting blocks as built in structures at the start line.  Portable blocks were held by long metal spikes that needed to be pounded into the ground. These devices evolved to metal blocks. The common blocks of the 1960s were heavy and adjusted by screws that were frequently broken or became rusted over the years. Lighter weight blocks were made of sheet metal. [[Nick Newton]]'s innovative design uses cast aluminum.

The rubberized surfaces of new [[all-weather running track]]s that became common starting in the 1970s, made the old blocks even less secure.  Original [[Tartan track]]s left long holes to secure the blocks but most tracks today require blocks to be held by small spikes similar to the ones used in shoes. Block slippage was common enough that it is an allowable loophole in the rules to recall the start of a race without calling a [[false start]] against an athlete whose blocks slip. In some amateur settings, such as high school track, since block slippage is much more common due to lower quality track surface material and/or starting blocks' spike quality, it is a commonly accepted practice to allow another person (usually a teammate) to sit on the ground behind the starting block and place their feet behind each block, using their leg power to further reduce the chance for the blocks to slip back upon the runner launching out of them.

Generally most races of [[400 meters]] or shorter allow athletes to use starting blocks. Most runners in the [[Athletics at the 1956 Summer Olympics – Men's 800 metres|800 meters at the 1956 Olympics]] used starting blocks from a waterfall start.

Modern blocks used for world records now must have sensors that detect the pressure from the athlete and can be used to time their reaction to the starting gun. Athletes who react faster than 1/10th of a second can be charged with a false start and the race recalled.&lt;ref name="iaaf.org"/&gt;  Many also carry electronic speakers so the sound of the gun arrives at the ears of the athletes at exactly the same time.  Some races for hearing-impaired athletes have also used starting light systems, similar to [[Christmas tree (drag racing)|motorsport's Christmas Tree]].

'''Vida Arena''' (branded as '''VIDA Arena''') is a [[multi-purpose stadium|multi-purpose]] indoor [[arena]] located in [[Växjö]], [[Sweden]]. The arena opened in September 2011 and is best known as the home arena for the [[ice hockey]] team [[Växjö Lakers]]. It seats 5,700 spectators.&lt;ref name="5700 spectators" /&gt;

==Construction==
The construction of Vida Arena began in September 2010 and was finished in summer 2011, in time for the [[Växjö Lakers]]' debut season in the [[Swedish Hockey League|Elitserien]] (now named the SHL), the top-tier ice hockey league in Sweden. Although mainly intended to be used for [[ice hockey]], Vida Arena is also used for other events such as [[concert]]s and [[news conference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smp.se/sport/vida-arena---i-14-ar%282119511%29.gm |title=Vida arena - i 14 år |publisher=''Smålandsposten'' |author=Daniel Rydström |language=Swedish |date=2010-09-25 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena is named after the [[Vida AB|Vida Group]], the company that acquired the [[naming rights]] for Vida Arena in September 2010, for the upcoming 14 seasons (expiring after the 2023–24 season).&lt;ref name="VIDA information"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vida.se/vida-arena-namnet-pa-vaxjo-lakers-nya-hockeyarena-.aspx |title=VIDA Arena - namnet på Växjö Lakers nya hockeyarena |publisher=[[Vida AB|Vida Group]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=2011-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002163137/http://www.vida.se/vida-arena-namnet-pa-vaxjo-lakers-nya-hockeyarena-.aspx |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectator capacity==
As of the [[2013–14 SHL season|2013–14 season]], Vida Arena is the [[Swedish Hockey League|SHL]]'s newest arena and has a [[seating capacity|spectator capacity]] of 5,700, making it the SHL's capacity-wise next-to-smallest arena, only surpassing Örebro's [[Behrn Arena (ice hockey)|Behrn Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vaxjolakers.se/vida-arena/fakta-om-vida-arena |title=Fakta om VIDA Arena |publisher=[[Växjö Lakers Hockey|Växjö Lakers]] |author= |language=Swedish |date= |accessdate=2012-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416013028/http://www.vaxjolakers.se/vida-arena/fakta-om-vida-arena |archivedate=2012-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the entire [[2011–12 Elitserien season|2011–12 season]], the arena had a capacity of 5,329 spectators. Plans were announced to extend the capacity to at least 6,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smp.se/sport/snart-plats-for-6-000-askadare%282796358%29.gm |title=Snart plats för 6 000 åskådare |publisher=''Smålandsposten'' |author=Daniel Enestubbe |language=Swedish |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="5800 spectators" /&gt; Prior to the beginning of the [[2012–13 Elitserien season|2012–13 season]], the capacity was increased to 5,800 spectators.&lt;ref name="5800 spectators"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vaxjolakers.se/artikel/28014/ |title=Vida Arena växer |publisher=[[Växjö Lakers]] |last=Gustavsson |first=Jonas |language=Swedish |date=2012-09-14 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, however, the capacity was slightly reduced to 5,700 due to concerns from spectators. Level 4 was mainly affected.&lt;ref name="5700 spectators"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vaxjolakers.se/artikel/28967/ |title=Ny publikkapacitet: 5700 |publisher=[[Växjö Lakers]] |last=Gustavsson |first=Jonas |language=Swedish |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inauguration==
The arena was officially inaugurated on 17 September 2011, in an ice hockey game between Växjö Lakers and [[Linköpings HC]]. The arena tickets for the game were outsold within just one hour, with the Lakers' [[marketing management|marketing manager]] speculating that they could've sold out two arenas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/hockey/sverige/elitserien/vaxjo/article13582651.ab |title=Hade kunnat sälja ut två arenor |publisher=''[[Aftonbladet]]'' |author=Hampus Hagman |language=Swedish |date=2011-09-06 |accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Växjö Lakers crowd favorite [[Shjon Podein]] watched the game live in the arena.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4906">A '''welding helmet''' is a type of [[Personal protective equipment|headgear]] used when performing certain types of [[welding]] to protect the eyes, face and neck from flash burn, [[ultraviolet light]], [[Spark (fire)|sparks]], [[infrared light]], and heat. 

Welding helmets are most commonly used with [[arc welding]] processes such as [[shielded metal arc welding]], [[gas tungsten arc welding]], and [[gas metal arc welding]]. They are necessary to prevent [[arc eye]], a painful condition where the [[cornea]] is inflamed. Welding helmets can also prevent [[retina]] burns, which can lead to a loss of vision. Both conditions are caused by unprotected exposure to the highly concentrated ultraviolet and infrared rays emitted by the welding arc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elvex.com/facts11.htm Elvex Safety Products ''How Light Affects the Eye'']&lt;/ref&gt; Ultraviolet emissions from the welding arc can also damage uncovered skin, causing a [[sunburn]]-like condition in a relatively short period of welding. In addition to the radiation, gasses or splashes can also be a hazard to the skin and the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.testbericht-testsieger.de/kaufberatung-automatik-schweissmasken-schweisshelme/|title=Testbericht zur Automatik-Schweißmaske Speedglas 100 von 3M|date=2017-01-12|newspaper=Testberichte für Testsieger|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern welding helmet used today was first introduced in 1937 by Willson Products.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=79oDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RasMTuyGFYifsQLC3sGzCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "One Piece Helmet Cut To Protect The Welder] ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1937 -- bottom-left of page 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Most welding helmets include a window covered with a filter called a lens shade, through which the welder can see to work. In most helmets, the window may be made of tinted glass, tinted plastic, or a variable-density filter made from a pair of [[polarizer|polarized]] lenses.

==Safety==
All welding helmets are susceptible to damages such as cracks that can compromise the protection from ultraviolet and infrared rays. In addition to protecting the eyes, the helmet protects the face from hot metal sparks generated by the arc and from UV damage. When overhead welding, a leather skull cap and shoulder cover are used to prevent head and shoulder burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Miller | first = Mark R. | title = Welding Licensing Exam Study Guide | page = 5 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-07-149376-5 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auto-darkening filters==
[[Image:Speedglas.jpg|thumb|Speedglas welding helmet.]]
In 1981, Swedish manufacturer Hornell International introduced an LCD electronic shutter that darkens automatically when sensors detect the bright welding arc,&lt;ref name=speedglas&gt;[http://www.3m.com/product/information/Speedglas-Welding.html 3M Speedglas Auto-Darkening Welding Helmet ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.testbericht-testsieger.de/technische-entwicklung-automatischer-schweisserschutzfilter/|title=Technische Entwicklung automatischer Schweißerschutzfilter|date=2017-01-19|newspaper=Testberichte für Testsieger|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Speedglas Auto-Darkening Filter. 

With such electronic auto-darkening helmets, the welder no longer has to get ready to weld and then nod their head to lower the helmet over their face. The advantage is that the welder does not need to adjust the position of welding helmet manually which not only saves time but also reduces the risk of exposure to the harmful light generated by the welding process.

In January 2004, 3M acquired all assets of Hornell, including the Adflo and Speedglas auto darkening helmets brand name and patents. Speedglas helmets are now sold by 3M.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.3m.com/press-release/company/3m-acquire-hornell-international-expands-safety-products-line 3m.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==ANSI standards==
In the United States, the industry standard for welding helmets is ANSI Z87.1+ which specifies performance of a wide variety of eye protection devices. The standard requires that auto-darkening helmets provide full protection against both UV and IR even when they are not in the darkened state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The standard is voluntary, so buyers should confirm that the helmet is ANSI Z87.1 compliant (indicated by appropriate labeling).
