      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7634">'''Access ©''' or '''Access Copyright''' is the operating name of a [[Canada Business Corporations Act]] corporation whose official registration name is '''The Canadian [[Copyright]] Licensing Agency''' (formerly Cancopy). It is a not-for-profit [[copyright collective]] that collects revenues from licensed Canadian businesses, government, schools, libraries and other copyright users for the photocopying of print works and distributes those monies to the rightsholders of those works, such as publishers and authors from Canada and around the world. 

Access Copyright covers works published in [[Australia]], [[Argentina]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Malta]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[South Africa]], [[Singapore]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].

==University model license==

When universities sign on to a license with Access Copyright (negotiated by the [[Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada]] (AUCC) or the [[Association of Canadian Community Colleges]]), their professors and students are given permission to do certain copying of copyrighted works. The university is generally charged a base rate per full-time student for this license, usually passed down to students in the form of mandatory fees.
''2011 AUCC model license''
A new model, negotiated by AUCC in 2011, would see universities pay a rate of $26 per full-time student. The old agreement, which expired in 2010, charged only $3.38 plus an additional 10 cents per page coursepacks, photocopied compilations of readings designed by instructors and sold to students.&lt;ref name="OC"&gt;[https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Ottawa+universities+mulling+over+controversial+copyright+agreement/6723229/story.html Ottawa universities mulling over controversial new copyright agreement]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608040159/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Ottawa%2Buniversities%2Bmulling%2Bover%2Bcontroversial%2Bcopyright%2Bagreement/6723229/story.html |date=June 8, 2012 }}, Ottawa Citizen, 3 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, additional stipulations would proscribe faculty and students from keeping copies of journal articles in personal libraries, or on personal computers or email accounts.&lt;ref name = "OC"/&gt;

These changes have proved controversial, and numerous universities have opted out of the deal.

==Controversy==

Access Copyright has also started charging universities for e-mailing links to copyrighted information, even in cases where there was no copyrighted material present. They are charging the full price for each link e-mailed.&lt;ref&gt;http://boingboing.net/2012/02/20/canadian-universities-sign-bon.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''African Centre for Technology Studies''' (ACTS) is an intergovernmental non-profit organization, founded in 1988 by [[Calestous Juma]]  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS|commas=true}}&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt; in Nairobi, Kenya, promoting policy-oriented research on science and technology in development that is sustainable in terms of the economy, society, and the environment.&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt; It was the first African non-profit organization to combine policy research, science and technology.&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==History==
Founded in 1988, ACTS was a pioneer in development research on innovative development policies related to applied science, technology, and innovation.&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt;

ACTS research influenced policies on industrial property legislation and policy in Kenya, environmental impact assessment standards in Eastern and Southern Africa,  [[biofuels]] and [[bio-energy]] in Kenya, Eastern and West Africa. ACTS has also influenced policies across Africa on issues such as [[climate change adaptation]] and [[climate change mitigation|mitigation]], agriculture, biotechnology, [[biodiplomacy]], and [[biosafety]].&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt;

==Affiliations==
ACTS is a member of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD),  which includes 150 data producers and users working towards sustainable development focusing on data that informs research ending extreme poverty and addressing climate change. The Canadian, Colombian, French, Ghanaian, Italian, Mexican, Moroccan, Nigerian, Philippine, Senagalese, United Kingdom and United States' governments are member-states of the network.&lt;ref name="sustainabledevelopment_UN"&gt;{{citation |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=9691 |title=Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data |publisher=United Nations |date=2016 |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2013, ACTS was named as one of the top Environment Think Tanks globally.&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt; In 1991 the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa ([[CODESRIA]]) honored ACTS for its contribution to expanding the knowledge base for development in Africa with the Justinian Rweyemamu Prize, named after Tanzania’s first major economics scholar, [[Justinian Rweyemamu]].&lt;ref name="who_when" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Juma_Harvard_2012" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Community-based actions==
ACTS policy researchers engage with local communities to encourage communities to reflect on and learn from their own coping mechanisms when faced with flood-prone areas. They then choose best practice adaptations and develop long-term proactive strategies for flood mitigation which might include crop diversification.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://cdkn.org/resource/in-conversation-with-elvin-nyukuri-african-centre-for-technology-studies-2/?loclang=en_gb |title=In conversation with… Elvin Nyukuri, African Centre for Technology Studies |publisher=African Centre for Technology Studies |date=May 16, 2011 |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected publications==
ACTS published the groundbreaking study by Harvard professor, Calestous Juma&lt;ref name="List of Fellows"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Fellows|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about-us/people-council-committees/the-fellowship/list-of-fellows}}&lt;/ref&gt; and J.

In his 1993 article, in which he examined legal processes regarding access and tenurial issues in regards to group and individual pastoral natural resource management in Turkana in Kenya, focusing on tree rights, Edmund G.C. Barrow made a case for indigenous property rights.&lt;ref name="Barrow_1993_Tree_rights"&gt;{{citation |publisher=Biopolicy International, African Centre for Technology Studies via Bioline International |number=8 |date=1993 |pages=1–23 |title=Tree Rights in Kenya: The Case of the Turkana (Part 1) |author=Edmund G.C.

'''AllOfMP3''', '''MP3Sparks''' and '''MemphisMembers''' are brands of [[online music store]] that were operated by Mediaservices, Inc., a company founded in 2000 in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].  The stores formerly sold music encoded in standard, [[Digital rights management|non-protected]] audio formats at a significantly lower cost than other online music stores. In 2008, the original AllOfMp3 site was replaced by a blog.

The company has been plagued by [[#Legal issues|legal issues]] for some time due to accusations, mainly from the [[record industry]], that they are operating illegally and engaging in [[music piracy]].&lt;ref name=nytimes_popular&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/01/world/europe/01cnd-mp3.html?ex=1306814400&amp;en=4c9bcba30952e86b&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss Russian Download Site Is Popular and Possibly Illegal]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revenue ==

Run by the Moscow company MediaServices, AllOfMP3 had an estimated revenue of [[United States dollar|US$]]30 million in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nypost.com/seven/12212006/business/music_labels__nyet_to_russian_pirates_business_peter_lauria.htm Music Labels: Nyet to Russian Pirates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110055529/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12212006/business/music_labels__nyet_to_russian_pirates_business_peter_lauria.htm |date=2007-01-10 }}" [[New York Post]], December 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] and various other label representatives the company has never transferred money to any (western) label.  AllofMP3 claims to have offered settlements to IFPI, which AllOfMP3 claims IFPI refused to accept.

== Legal issues ==

AllOfMP3's legality is controversial.  It is licensed in Russia by the [[Russian Organization for Multimedia and Digital Systems]], a licence similar to agreements held by Russian [[radio station]]s.  AllOfMP3 states that this agreement allows it to distribute music legally from all artists and all labels.  This is disputed by most major record labels, which generally do not recognize ROMS or believe that it has the authority to distribute their works.  AllOfMP3.com makes no claims as to its legality outside of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.slate.com/id/2115868/ Barely Legal]", [[Slate Magazine]], March 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However it is accessible to visitors in all countries.

In 2005, Moscow authorities began investigating the site as a result of a formal complaint from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), who accused the site of "large-scale copyright infringement".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/02/22/allofmp3_probe/ Russian police probe cheap downloads site]" [[The Register]], February 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2006, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that US trade negotiators have warned Russia that the continued existence of AllOfMP3 could jeopardize Russia's entry into the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref name=nytimes_popular/&gt; This was reiterated by the [[United States Trade Representative]] [[Susan Schwab]] in remarks to the US [[Chamber of Commerce]] on September 28, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Document_Library/Transcripts/2006/September/asset_upload_file794_9872.pdf Remarks by U.S. Trade Representative Susan C. Schwab, U.S. Chamber of Commerce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106100423/http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Document_Library/Transcripts/2006/September/asset_upload_file794_9872.pdf |date=2006-11-06 }}", September 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; She later told reporters that "I have a hard time imagining Russia becoming a member of the WTO and having a Web site like that up and running that is so clearly a violation of everyone's intellectual property rights."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6122879.html U.S. pushes Russia in WTO talks to close MP3 site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201050141/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6122879.html |date=2006-12-01 }}", [[ZDNet]], October 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressure from the IFPI resulted in AllOfMP3 being blocked by the Danish [[ISP]], [[Tele2]] in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.russianspy.org/2006/10/27/swedish-tele2-will-block-allofmp3com/ Swedish Tele2 Will Block AllofMP3.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213442/http://www.russianspy.org/2006/10/27/swedish-tele2-will-block-allofmp3com/ |date=2007-09-27 }}" [http://www.russianspy.org/ Russian Spy], October 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://business.bostonherald.com/businessNews/view.bg?articleid=173284 Record labels sue operator of Russian music Web site AllofMP3.com]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}" [[Boston Herald]] December 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the [[RIAA]], on behalf of [[EMI]], [[Sony BMG]], [[Universal Music Group]], and [[Warner Music Group]] filed a US$1.65 trillion lawsuit against the site. That equates to US$150,000 for each of 11 million songs downloaded between June to October 2006, and exceeds Russia's entire GDP.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://tech.cybernetnews.com/2006/12/22/allofmp3com-sued-for-165-trillion/ Sued for $1.65 Trillion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322040930/http://tech.cybernetnews.com/2006/12/22/allofmp3com-sued-for-165-trillion/ |date=2007-03-22 }}" [[cybernetnews.com]] December 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nypost.com/seven/12212006/business/music_labels__nyet_to_russian_pirates_business_peter_lauria.htm Music Labels: Nyet to Russian Pirates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110055529/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12212006/business/music_labels__nyet_to_russian_pirates_business_peter_lauria.htm |date=2007-01-10 }}", [[New York Post]], December 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; $150,000 is the statutory limit for copyright infringement awards in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|504}}(c) US CODE: Title 17,504. Remedies for infringement: Damages and profits ([[Cornell University Law School]])&lt;/ref&gt; Allofmp3 responded to the lawsuit saying ''"AllofMP3 understands that several U.S. record label companies filed a lawsuit against Media Services in New York. This suit is unjustified as AllofMP3 does not operate in New York. Certainly the labels are free to file any suit they wish, despite knowing full well that AllofMP3 operates legally in Russia. In the mean time, AllofMP3 plans to continue to operate legally and comply with all Russian laws."''.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.slyck.com/story1368.html AllofMP3.com Responds to the $1.64 Trillion Lawsuit]" [[Slyck.com]], December 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, UK police arrested a 25-year-old man on fraud charges for selling allofmp3.com vouchers on sites such as [[eBay]] and allofmp3vouchers.co.uk.  The man was reported to be funneling money from the sale of these vouchers back to the owners of the site in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6677265.stm MP3 site's voucher system closes]" [[BBC News]], May 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A statement in relation to this alleged transfer of funds to Russia was made by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] chairman.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bpi.co.uk/news/press/index.asp?fName=news_content_file_1078.shtml Police dawn raid stops allofmp3.com pirate vouchers scheme]", [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] press release, May 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Allofmp3 was banned from service by its [[payment processor]] [[Pavel Vrublevsky#Chronopay|ChronoPay]].

In an interview with [[p2pnet]], a MediaServices representative said "It is disappointing that United States Trade Representative Susan Schwab completely and deliberately mischaracterized AllofMP3.com. Furthermore, it is irresponsible to use AllofMP3.com as a negotiating instrument in an attempt to extract concessions from Russia in return for US support for accession to the World Trade Organization".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.p2pnet.net/story/12348 p2pnet talks to AllofMP3.com] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120906024755/http://www.p2pnet.net/story/12348 |date=2012-09-06 }}" [[p2pnet]], 28 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, a Moscow court ruled that [[Visa (company)|Visa]]'s decision to cut off payments to allTunes was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://eng.cnews.ru/news/top/indexEn.shtml?2007/07/13/258719 Russian pirates get Visa in court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823070406/http://eng.cnews.ru/news/top/indexEn.shtml?2007%2F07%2F13%2F258719 |date=2007-08-23 }}" [[CNews]] July 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, Denis Kvasov, head of the company which owned AllofMP3.com, was acquitted of all charges stemming from copyright infringement prosecution.  The prosecution was seen as a test case of Russia's commitment to fighting [[piracy]], and was brought after [[EMI]], [[NBC Universal]] and [[Time Warner]] lobbied for such prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070815/wr_nm/russia_website_dc_2 Russian court acquits music site owner]" [[Yahoo News]] August 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008 [[The Register]] reported that MP3Sparks.com and its associated web sites were being hosted (since December 2007)
by [[AbdAllah Internet]], a Turkish web hosting service which allegedly provides safe harbour for [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] and [[malware]] operations as well as having strong links to the [[Russian Business Network]]. For this reason access to the AbdAllah network is blocked by some ISPs, including all UK members of [[LINX]], therefore blocking access to MP3Sparks as well.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/11/mp3sparks_cogent_abdallah/ MP3sparks.com downed by links to Russian cybercrime gang]" [[The Register]], January 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2008, the [[RIAA]] dropped all copyright infringement charges against AllOfMP3.com.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=as0feZVmo0_A]" [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closure of AllOfMP3 ==

In June 2007, AllOfMP3 announced on their site that they were "closed for maintenance", while Times Online reported that an unnamed person claiming to be an ex-employee told them it was closed down following pressure from the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]]. MP3Sparks, however, remained available,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article2016297.ece Russia shuts down Allofmp3.com]" [[Times Online]], July 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; as did the AllTunes download service.

Following the acquittal of Denis Kvasov by a Moscow court in August 2007, a brief message was posted at the site's blog, stating "The service will be resumed in the foreseeable future".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6967172.stm Russian music site to 'relaunch']" [[BBC News Online]], August 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== About the services ==

The sites offer [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[English language|English]] user interfaces. All functions, except for the buying of songs and full length song previews, are available to unregistered users (and full length preview of songs is restricted to individuals who have spent a total of $50 or more on the website).  Registration is free. The store maintains an account balance for each user; while a user's account has a positive balance, he or she can continue downloading music. To do so, the user selects the files for download from the store's catalog.

===Pricing model===

Unlike some US-based music stores such as [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[iTunes Store]], MediaServices' sites charge for the volume of data downloaded, not for individual songs.

This price is often reduced by a complicated system of discounts based on cumulative usage, promotions, and type of payment.  These discounts can reduce the effective price of downloads by up to one third of the original cost.

===Payment methods===

The sites operate using a pre-paid balance method. Users fund their account using a [[Credit card|credit]] or [[debit card]], in increments of US$10 or more.

However, action taken in late 2006 by [[Visa (company)|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.cnet.com/Visa+halts+its+service+for+allofmp3.com/2100-1027_3-6127168.html Visa halts its service for allofmp3.com]" [[CNET]], October 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/10/19/allofmp3_attacks_visa_and_mastercard/ Blacklisted AllofMP3 slams 'capricious' Visa and Mastercard]" [[The Register]], October 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; made it impossible for users to fund their accounts at the main AllOfMP3 site.

Users outside UK and US can also pay using a variety of credit cards at ChronoPay processor.  ChronoPay had announced on March 20, 2007 that they would no longer be processing payments from online Russian music stores that only hold a [[Russian Organization for Multimedia and Digital Systems|ROMS]] license (e.g. AllOfMP3), but this does not apply to MP3Sparks which has an [[:ru:ФАИР|NP FAIR]] license.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.chronopay.com/en/content/view/218/121/ JSC ChronoPay accepts Russian music stores with [[:ru:ФАИР|NP FAIR]] license only]" ([http://www.chronopay.com/ ChronoPay] press release)&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April and June 2007, it had become difficult for users to fund their AllOfMP3 accounts themselves, and a number of users and sites began selling AllOfMP3 gift vouchers on the Internet. However, in May 2007 a man who had been selling vouchers was arrested in London,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070521-allofmp3-voucher-operation-shut-down-in-europe.html AllofMP3 voucher operation shut down in Europe]" [[Ars Technica]], May 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and this led many other voucher sellers to shut down their operations.

===Download formats===

AllOfMP3 (and now MP3Sparks) allows users to choose from a variety of [[audio codecs]] for audio files.  Lossy formats are offered in [[constant bitrate]]s up to 320kbit/s or [[variable bitrate]]s up to maximum quality in the following formats:
*[[MP3]]
*[[Windows Media Audio|WMA]]
*[[Ogg Vorbis]]
*[[Advanced Audio Coding|MPEG4-AAC]]
*[[Musepack|MPC]]
Select albums are also being made available in [[Lossless data compression|Lossless audio codecs]] in the following formats:
*[[FLAC]]
*[[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]]
*[[Monkey's Audio]]
*[[OptimFROG]]
*[[Windows Media Audio#Windows Media Audio Lossless|WMA Lossless]]
Most music is encoded straight from source, which is dubbed ''Online Encoding Exclusive'', so gapless albums could provide [[gapless playback]], unlike most other music services.  There is no extra charge for using the Online Encoding Exclusive service.  The user sets the codec parameters, including the desired bitrate, allowing for superior quality over other music download services such as iTunes and Napster.

Downloaded files do not contain [[digital rights management]] information, allowing unrestricted use between multiple computers and [[digital audio players]]. This differentiates AllOfMP3 from many other music download services, which limit the use of the music the user may purchase and the platforms on which it may be played.

The websites also offer free, full album previews, streamed at a bitrate of 24 kilobits per second (roughly equivalent to analog [[telephone]] audio quality).  Registered users who have spent less than $50 have access to 90 second samples, and unregistered users have access to 30 second samples.

==== Music for Masses ====

In late 2006, AllOfMP3 experimented with a feature called "Music for Masses" which allowed users to download [[digital rights management|DRM]]-protected music for free.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/18/technology/18musiccnd.html?hp&amp;ex=1161230400&amp;en=b3505998b2c3b2a7&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage Moscow Music Site Defends Free Downloads]" [[The New York Times]] October 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The files were encoded in a proprietary MP3 format (.mp3x) that could only be played in the Music for Masses player, and could not be transferred to a portable media device. However, the DRM protection was cracked within a week.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.engadget.com/2006/10/25/musicforme-cracks-allofmp3s-drm-hilarity-ensues/ MusicForMe cracks AllOfMP3's DRM, hilarity ensues]" [[Engadget]], October 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although AllOfMP3 released a compulsory update to the player software which rendered the original crack unusable, they eventually removed the service in December 2006.

===Download methods===

The standard method of downloading purchased music is directly from the services' "My Downloads" pages. Files can be downloaded from the links on this page using a [[web browser]], or alternatively a [[download manager]] or a command-line utility such as [[wget]] (the site offers a "list of links" which can be written to a file and used as input for such tools). Download speeds vary but typically hover around 40-120 kilobytes per second on [[broadband]] connections.

A more streamlined experience for AllOfMP3 account holders is offered by the [[Microsoft Windows]] application '''allTunes''' and the older [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] application '''AllofMP3 Explorer'''.  These applications allow the user to browse and search the entire AllOfMP3 catalogue (which is downloaded and stored locally for faster searching) and select files for download. The application then downloads the files in the background.

The '''Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990''' ({{UnitedStatesCode|42|12101}}) is a [[civil rights]] law that prohibits [[discrimination]] based on [[disability]]. It affords similar protections against discrimination to [[Americans with disabilities]] as the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 Civil Rights Act of 1964] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5lHSBSuc4?url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |date=November 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which made discrimination based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], [[gender|sex]], national origin, and other characteristics illegal. In addition, unlike the Civil Rights  Act, the ADA also requires covered employers to provide [[reasonable accommodation]]s to employees with disabilities, and imposes [[accessibility]] requirements on public accommodations.&lt;ref&gt;42 U.S.C. 12112(b)(5), 12182–84&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the [[National Council on Disability]] had recommended enactment of an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and drafted the first version of the bill which was introduced in the House and Senate in 1988. The final version of the bill was [[signed into law]] on July 26, 1990, by President [[George H. W. Bush]]. It was later [[ADA Amendments Act of 2008|amended in 2008]] and signed by President [[George W. Bush]] with changes effective as of January 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=President Bush Signs ADA Changes into Law |date=September 25, 2008 |publisher=HR.BLR.com |url=http://hr.blr.com/news.aspx?id=78926 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205192712/http://hr.blr.com/news.aspx?id=78926 |archivedate=February 5, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ADA disabilities include both mental and physical medical conditions. A condition does not need to be severe or permanent to be a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=EEOC |title=Fact Sheet on the EEOC's Final Regulations Implementing the ADAAA |url=http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/regulations/adaaa_fact_sheet.cfm |website=EEOC.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] regulations provide a list of conditions that should easily be concluded to be disabilities: deafness, blindness, an intellectual disability (formerly termed mental retardation), partially or completely missing limbs or mobility impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair, [[autism]], cancer, [[cerebral palsy]], diabetes, epilepsy, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=FR&gt;{{cite web |title=76 FR 16977 |year=2011 |publisher=federalregister.gov |url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/03/25/2011-6056/regulations-to-implement-the-equal-employment-provisions-of-the-americans-with-disabilities-act-as}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mental or physical health conditions also may be disabilities, depending on what the individual's symptoms would be in the absence of "mitigating measures" (medication, therapy, assistive devices, or other means of restoring function), during an "active episode" of the condition (if the condition is episodic).&lt;ref name="FR" /&gt;

Certain specific conditions that are widely considered [[anti-social behavior|anti-social]], or tend to result in illegal activity, such as [[kleptomania]], [[pedophilia]], exhibitionism, voyeurism, etc. are excluded under the definition of "disability" in order to prevent abuse of the statute's purpose.&lt;ref name=42USC12102&gt;{{cite web |title=42 U.S. Code § 12102 - Definition of disability, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, As Amended |author1=Civil Rights Division, US Department of Justice |year=2009 |publisher=ada.gov |url=http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm#12102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PL110325&gt;{{cite web |title=Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008, PL 110-325 (S 3406) |author1=EEOC |year=2008 |publisher=eeoc.gov |url=http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/adaaa.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, other specific conditions, such as gender identity disorders, are also excluded under the definition of "disability".&lt;ref name=PL110325 /&gt;&lt;ref name=42USC12211&gt;{{cite web |title=42 U.S. Code § 12211 - Definitions, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, As Amended |author1=Civil Rights Division, US Department of Justice |year=2009 |publisher=ada.gov |url=http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm#12211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ADA states that a "covered entity" shall not discriminate against "a qualified individual with a disability".&lt;ref name="12112a"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12112(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies to [[application for employment|job application]] procedures, hiring, advancement and discharge of employees, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. "Covered entities" include employers with 15 or more employees, as well as [[employment agencies]], [[labor organizations]], and joint [[Industrial relations|labor-management]] committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12111(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are strict limitations on when a covered entity can ask job applicants or employees disability-related questions or require them to undergo medical examination, and all medical information must be kept confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=EEOC |title=Enforcement Guidance: Preemployment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations |url=http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/preemp.html |website=EEOC.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=EEOC |title=EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act |url=http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/preemp.html |website=EEOC.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prohibited discrimination may include, among other things, firing or refusing to hire someone based on a real or perceived disability, segregation, and harassment based on a disability. Covered entities are also required to provide [[reasonable accommodation]]s to job applicants and employees with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12112(b)(5)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reasonable accommodation is a change in the way things are typically done that the person needs because of a disability, and can include, among other things, special equipment that allows the person to perform the job, scheduling changes, and changes to the way work assignments are chosen or communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=EEOC |title=EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act |url=http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html |website=EEOC.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; An employer is not required to provide an accommodation that would involve undue hardship (significant difficulty or expense), and the individual who receives the accommodation must still perform the essential functions of the job and meet the normal performance requirements. An employee or applicant who currently engages in the illegal use of drugs is not considered qualified when a covered entity takes adverse action based on such use.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ways to discriminate against people based on disabilities, including psychological ones. Anyone known to have a history of mental disorders can be considered disabled. Employers with more than 15 employees must take care to treat all employees fairly and with any accommodations needed. Even when an employee is doing a job exceptionally well, she or he is not necessarily no longer disabled; employers must continue to follow all policies for the disabled.

Part of Title I was found unconstitutional by the [[United States Supreme Court]] as it pertains to states in the case of ''[[Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett]]'' as violating the [[sovereign immunity]] rights of the several states as specified by the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The Court determined that state employees cannot sue their employer for violating ADA rules. State employees can, however, file complaints at the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] or the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], who can sue on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Disability Rights in the Supreme Court|url = http://www.civilrights.org/monitor/vol11_no4/art1p1.html|website = The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights|access-date = January 27, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20020201040214/http://www.civilrights.org/monitor/vol11_no4/art1p1.html|archive-date = February 1, 2002|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Title II}} Title II—public entities (and public transportation)===
{{hatnote|See {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12131|12165}}.}}
[[File:Handicapped Accessible sign.svg|thumb|upright|Access sign]]

Title II prohibits disability discrimination by all public entities at the local level, ''e.g.'', school district, municipal, city, or county, and at state level. Public entities must comply with Title II regulations by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]. These regulations cover access to all programs and services offered by the entity. Access includes physical access described in the ADA Standards for Accessible Design and programmatic access that might be obstructed by discriminatory policies or procedures of the entity.

Title II applies to public transportation provided by public entities through regulations by the [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]]. It includes the [[Amtrak|National Railroad Passenger Corporation]] (Amtrak), along with all other commuter authorities. This section requires the provision of paratransit services by public entities that provide fixed route services. ADA also sets minimum requirements for space layout in order to facilitate wheelchair securement on public transport.&lt;ref&gt;'Wheelchair Securement in Public Transport', http://thequantumleap.com/faq/&lt;/ref&gt;

Title II also applies to all state and local public housing, housing assistance, and housing referrals. The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] is charged with enforcing this provision.

==={{anchor|Title III}}Title III—public accommodations (and commercial facilities)===
{{hatnote|See {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12181|12189}}.}}
[[File:Drano Lake accessible fishing platform signage.jpg|thumb|The ADA sets standards for construction of accessible public facilities. Shown is a sign indicating an accessible fishing platform at [[Drano Lake]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].]]
Under Title III, no individual may be discriminated against on the basis of disability with regards to the full and equal [[enjoyment]] of the goods, services, facilities, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation. Public accommodations include most places of lodging (such as inns and hotels), recreation, transportation, education, and dining, along with stores, care providers, and places of public displays.

Under Title III of the ADA, all new construction (construction, modification or alterations) after the effective date of the ADA (approximately July 1992) must be fully compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG)&lt;ref name=ada90/&gt; found in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] at 28&amp;nbsp;C.F.R., Part 36, Appendix ''A''.

Title III also has application to existing facilities. One of the definitions of "discrimination" under Title III of the ADA is a "failure to remove" architectural barriers in existing facilities. See {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|42|12182|b|2|A|iv}}. This means that even facilities that have not been modified or altered in any way after the ADA was passed still have obligations. The standard is whether "removing barriers" (typically defined as bringing a condition into compliance with the ADAAG) is "readily achievable", defined as "...easily accomplished without much difficulty or expense".

The statutory definition of "readily achievable" calls for a [[balancing test]] between the cost of the proposed "fix" and the wherewithal of the business and/or owners of the business. Thus, what might be "readily achievable" for a sophisticated and financially capable corporation might not be readily achievable for a small or local business.

There are exceptions to this title; many private clubs and religious organizations may not be bound by Title III. With regard to historic properties (those properties that are listed or that are eligible for listing in the [[National Register of Historic Places]], or properties designated as historic under state or local law), those facilities must still comply with the provisions of Title III of the ADA to the "maximum extent feasible" but if following the usual standards would "threaten to destroy the historic significance of a feature of the building" then alternative standards may be used.

Under 2010 revisions of Department of Justice regulations, newly constructed or altered swimming pools, wading pools, and spas must have an accessible means of entrance and exit to pools for disabled people. However, the requirement is conditioned on whether providing access through a fixed lift is "readily achievable".  Other requirements exist, based on pool size, include providing a certain number of accessible means of entry and exit, which are outlined in Section 242 of the standards. However, businesses are free to consider the differences in application of the rules depending on whether the pool is new or altered, or whether the swimming pool was in existence before the effective date of the new rule. Full compliance may not be required for existing facilities; Section 242 and 1009 of the 2010 Standards outline such exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 ADA Pool Lift Compliance Deadline: Has Your Business Complied? |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/2013-ada-pool-lift-compliance-deadline-has-your-business-complied |work=The National Law Review |publisher=Lowndes, Drosdick, Doster, Kantor &amp; Reed, P.A. |date=January 29, 2013 |accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Service animals ====
The ADA provides explicit coverage for service animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html|title=Americans with Disabilities Act Questions and Answers:  Service Animals|website=www.ada.gov|access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guidelines have been developed not only to protect persons with disabilities, but also to indemnify businesses from damages related to granting access to service animals on their premises. Businesses are allowed to ask if the animal is a service animal and ask what tasks it is trained to perform, but they are not allowed to ask the service animal to perform the task nor ask for a special ID of the animal. They cannot ask what the person's disabilities are. A person with a disability cannot be removed from the premises unless either of two things happen: the animal is out of control and its owner can not get it under control (e.g. a dog barking uncontrollably in a restaurant), or the animal is a direct threat to people's health and safety. Allergies and fear of animals would not be considered a threat to people's health and safety, so it would not be a valid reason to deny access to people with service animals. Businesses that prepare or serve food must allow service animals and their owners on the premises even if state or local health laws otherwise prohibit animals on the premises. In this case, businesses that prepare or serve food are not required to provide care or food for service animals, nor do they have to provide a designated area for the service animal to use the bathroom. Lastly, people that require service dogs cannot be charged an extra fee for their service dog or be treated unfairly, for example, being isolated from people at a restaurant. People with disabilities cannot be treated as "less than" other customers. However, if a business normally charges for damages caused by the person to property, the customer with a disability will be charged for his/her service animal's damages to the property.

==={{anchor|Title IV}}Title IV—telecommunications===
Title IV of the ADA amended the landmark [[Communications Act of 1934]] primarily by adding section {{UnitedStatesCode|47|225}}. This section requires that all telecommunications companies in the U.S. take steps to ensure functionally equivalent services for consumers with disabilities, notably those who are deaf or hard of hearing and those with speech impairments. When Title IV took effect in the early 1990s, it led to the installation of public [[teletypewriter]] (TTY) machines and other TDD ([[Telecommunications Device for the Deaf|telecommunications devices for the deaf]]). Title IV also led to the creation, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, of what were then called dual-party relay services and now are known as [[Telecommunications Relay Services]] (TRS), such as [[STS relay]]. Today, many TRS-mediated calls are made over the Internet by consumers who use broadband connections. Some are [[Video Relay Service]] (VRS) calls, while others are text calls. In either variation, communication assistants translate between the signed or typed words of a consumer and the spoken words of others. In 2006, according to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), VRS calls averaged two million minutes a month.

==={{anchor|Title V}}Title V—miscellaneous provisions===
{{hatnote|See {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12201|12213}}.}}

Title V includes technical provisions. It discusses, for example, the fact that nothing in the ADA amends, overrides or cancels anything in [[Section 504]].&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|42|12187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Title V includes an anti-retaliation or coercion provision. The ''Technical Assistance Manual'' for the ADA explains this provision: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"III-3.6000 Retaliation or coercion. Individuals who exercise their rights under the ADA, or assist others in exercising their rights, are protected from retaliation. The prohibition against retaliation or coercion applies broadly to any individual or entity that seeks to prevent an individual from exercising his or her rights or to retaliate against him or her for having exercised those rights ... Any form of retaliation or coercion, including threats, intimidation, or interference, is prohibited if it is intended to interfere."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
The ADA has roots in [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 504]] of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Disability Rights Movement: from Charity to Confrontation|last=Fleischer|first=Doris Zames|last2=Zames|first2=Frieda|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=93–95|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drafting===
[[File:ADA Development of Administration Disability Policy 042189 Page 1.jpg|thumb|Development of George H.W. Bush Administration Disability Policy. White House Memo. April 21, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bush41.org/ |title=George Bush Presidential Library and Museum |website= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The idea of federal legislation enhancing and extending civil rights legislation to millions of Americans with disabilities gained bipartisan support in late 1988 and early 1989. In early 1989 both Congress and the newly-inaugurated Bush White House worked separately, then jointly, to write legislation capable of expanding civil rights without imposing undue harm or costs on those already in compliance with existing rules and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://presidentialtimeline.org/#/exhibit/41/06 |title=The Americans with Disabilities Act Exhibit |website=The Presidential Timeline |publisher=The Presidential Libraries of the National Archives and Records Administration |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206204300/http://www.presidentialtimeline.org/#/exhibit/41/06 |archivedate=December 6, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobbying===

Over the years, key activists and advocates played an important role in lobbying Members of the U.S. Congress to develop and pass the ADA, including [[Justin Whitlock Dart, Jr.]], [[Patrisha Wright]] and others.

Ms. Wright is known as "the General" for her work in coordinating the campaign to enact the ADA.&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isc.temple.edu/neighbor/ds/disabilityrightstimeline.htm |title=Disability History Timeline |year=2002 |work=Rehabilitation Research &amp; Training Center on Independent Living Management |publisher=[[Temple University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220065328/http://isc.temple.edu/neighbor/ds/disabilityrightstimeline.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dredf.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dredf.org/about/staff/wright.shtml |title=Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund - Patrisha A.

===Support and opposition===
====Support====
About the importance of making employment opportunities inclusive, Shirley Davis, director of global diversity and inclusion at the [[Society for Human Resource Management]], said: "People with disabilities represent a critical talent pool that is underserved and underutilized".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shrm.org/hrdisciplines/Diversity/Articles/Pages/ManagerswithDisabilities.aspx |title=Targeted Development for Managers with Disabilities |publisher=Society for Human Resource Management |author=Pamela Babcock |date=October 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opposition from religious groups====
The debate over the Americans with Disabilities Act led some religious groups to take opposite positions.&lt;ref name="Lawton"&gt;Lawton, K.A. ''Christianity Today'', 10/8/90, Vol. 34 Issue 14, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association of Christian Schools International]], opposed the ADA in its original form.&lt;ref&gt;"Should the Senate Approve the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1989?" ''[[Congressional Digest]]'' December (1989): 297&lt;/ref&gt; primarily because the ADA labeled religious institutions "public accommodations", and thus would have required churches to make costly structural changes to ensure access for all.&lt;ref&gt;"Should the Senate Approve the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1989?" [[Congressional Digest]] December (1989): 297.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost argument advanced by ACSI and others prevailed in keeping religious institutions from being labeled as "public accommodations".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Church groups such as the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] testified against the ADA's Title I employment provisions on grounds of religious liberty. The NAE believed the regulation of the internal employment of churches was "... an improper intrusion [of] the federal government."&lt;ref name="Lawton" /&gt;

====Opposition from business interests====
Many members of the business community opposed the Americans with Disabilities Act. Testifying before Congress, [[Greyhound Bus Lines]] stated that the act had the potential to "deprive millions of people of affordable intercity public transportation and thousands of rural communities of their only link to the outside world." The [[US Chamber of Commerce]] argued that the costs of the ADA would be "enormous" and have "a disastrous impact on many small businesses struggling to survive."&lt;ref&gt;"Should the Senate Approve the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1989?" [[Congressional Digest]] December (1989): 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Federation of Independent Businesses]], an organization that lobbies for small businesses, called the ADA "a disaster for small business."&lt;ref&gt;Mandel, Susan. "Disabling the GOP", ''The National Review'' November 6, 1990, Vol. 42 Issue 11, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-business conservative commentators joined in opposition, writing that the Americans with Disabilities Act was "an expensive headache to millions" that would not necessarily improve the lives of people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Brian. ''Reason'', Aug–Sep 95, Vol. 27 Issue 4, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Capitol Crawl"===

Shortly before the act was passed, [[disability rights]] activists with [[physical disability|physical disabilities]] coalesced in front of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]], shed their crutches, [[wheelchair]]s, [[powerchair]]s and other [[assistive device]]s, and immediately proceeded to crawl and pull their bodies up all 100 of the Capitol's front steps, without warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Eaton |first1=William J. |authorlink1=William J. Eaton |title=Disabled Persons Rally, Crawl Up Capitol Steps : Congress: Scores protest delays in passage of rights legislation. The logjam in the House is expected to break soon. |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-13/news/mn-211_1_capitol-steps |accessdate=September 4, 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 13, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the activists did so, many of them chanted "ADA now", and "Vote, Now".  Some activists who remained at the bottom of the steps held signs and yelled words of encouragement at the "Capitol Crawlers". Jennifer Keelan, a second grader with [[cerebral palsy]], was videotaped as she pulled herself up the steps, using mostly her hands and arms, saying "I'll take all night if I have to." This [[direct action]] is reported to have "inconvenienced" several senators and to have pushed them to approve the act. While there are those who do not attribute much overall importance to this action, the "Capitol Crawl" of 1990 is seen by some present-day disability activists in the United States as a central act for encouraging the ADA into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esshaki|first1=Tiffany|title=Remembering the 'Capitol Crawl' |url=http://www.candgnews.com/news/remembering-%E2%80%98capitol-crawl%E2%80%99-84863|accessdate=January 15, 2016|work=C&amp;G News|date=July 21, 2015|quote=The event, known as the "Capitol Crawl", was an image that legislators couldn't ignore, Bauer said.

===Final passage===
[[File:Bush signs in ADA of 1990.jpg|thumb|right|250px|President Bush signs the Americans with Disabilities Act into law]]

Senator [[Tom Harkin]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Iowa|IA]]) authored what became the final bill and was its chief sponsor in the Senate. Harkin delivered part of his introduction speech in sign language, saying it was so his deaf brother could understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date=July 13, 1990 |title=Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) Delivers Floor Speech in American Sign Language|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4519067/senator-tom-harkin-delivers-floor-speech-american-sign-language |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |format=|publisher=C-SPAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On signing the measure, [[George H. W. Bush]] said: 

{{quote|I know there may have been concerns that the ADA may be too vague or too costly, or may lead endlessly to litigation. But I want to reassure you right now that my administration and the United States Congress have carefully crafted this Act.

===ADA Amendments Act, 2008===
The ADA defines a covered disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a history of having such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) was charged with interpreting the 1990 law with regard to discrimination in employment. The EEOC developed regulations limiting an individual's impairment to one that "severely or significantly restricts" a major life activity. The ADAAA directed the EEOC to amend its regulations and replace "severely or significantly" with "substantially limits", a more lenient standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet on the EEOC's Final Regulations Implementing the ADAAA |url=http://www1.eeoc.gov//laws/regulations/adaaa_fact_sheet.cfm?renderforprint=1 |website=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, 2008, President [[George W. Bush]] signed the [[ADA Amendments Act of 2008]] (ADAAA) into law. The amendment broadened the definition of "disability", thereby extending the ADA's protections to a greater number of people.&lt;ref name=BLR&gt;{{cite web |title=ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA)—What Employers Need to Know |year=2008 |publisher=HR.BLR.com |url=http://www.blr.com/information-ada/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ADAAA also added to the ADA examples of "major life activities" including, but not limited to, "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working" as well as the operation of several specified ''major bodily functions''.&lt;ref name=BLR /&gt; The act overturned a 1999 US Supreme Court case that held that an employee was not disabled if the impairment could be corrected by mitigating measures; it specifically provides that such impairment must be determined without considering such ameliorative measures. It also overturned the court restriction that an impairment which substantially limits one major life activity must also limit others to be considered a disability.&lt;ref name=BLR /&gt;
In 2008, the [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor]] stated that the amendment "makes it absolutely clear that the ADA is intended to provide broad coverage to protect anyone who faces discrimination on the basis of disability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=United States of America Congressional Record Proceedings and Debates of the 110th Congress Second Session Volume 154-Part 10 |date=2008 |publisher=Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.

===25th anniversary, 2015===
{{as of|2015}} the ADA had improved access to public services, the built environment (e.g., crosswalks with curb cuts and accessible pedestrian signals), understanding of the abilities of people with disabilities, established a right to equal access to public services and has demonstrated the contributions which people with disabilities can make to the economy. Disparities have remained in employment, earned income, Internet access, transportation, housing, and educational attainment and the disabled remain at a disadvantage with respect to health and health care.&lt;ref name=nejm&gt;{{cite journal |author1=G.

==Reaction==
===Criticism===

====Employment====
The ADA has been criticized on the grounds that it decreases the employment rate for people with disabilities&lt;ref&gt;(see Schwochau &amp; Blanck for counter arguments)&lt;/ref&gt; and raises the cost of doing business for employers, in large part due to the additional legal risks, which employers avoid by quietly avoiding hiring people with disabilities. Some researchers believe that the law has been ineffectual.&lt;ref&gt;(see Schall, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1991 (after the enactment of the ADA) and 1995, the employment rate of men with disabilities dropped by 7.8% regardless of age, educational level, or type of disability, with the most affected being young, less-educated and mentally disabled men.&lt;ref name="deleire"&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeLeire |first=Thomas |title=The Unintended Consequences of the Americans with Disabilities Act |journal=Regulation |year=2000 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=21–24 |url=http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2000/4/deleire.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the many criticisms, a causal link between the ADA and declining disabled employment over much of the 1990s has not been definitively identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Picker |first1=Les |title=Did the ADA Reduce Employment of the Disabled? |url=https://www.nber.org/digest/nov04/w10528.html |website=nber.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, for men of all working ages and women under 40, [[Current Population Survey]] data showed a sharp drop in the employment of disabled workers, leading at least two economists to attribute the cause to the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Acemoglu |first=Daron |author2=Angrist, Joshua D. |title=Consequences of Employment Protection? The Case of the Americans with Disabilities Act |journal=Journal of Political Economy |date=October 1, 2001 |volume=109 |issue=5 |pages=915–957 |doi=10.1086/322836 |url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/17|hdl=1721.1/63433 |citeseerx=10.1.1.321.1338 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, a study in 2003 found that while the Act may have led to short term reactions by employers, in the long term, there were either positive or neutral consequences for wages and employment.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kruse and Lisa Schur, 'Employment of People with Disabilities Following the ADA' (2003) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-232X.00275/full 42(1) Industrial Relations 31]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the rate of employment among disabled people increased to 45% of the population of disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/prod/2012pubs/p70-131.pdf US Census 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Professional plaintiffs"   ====
Since enforcement of the act began in July 1992, it has quickly become a major component of employment law. The ADA allows private plaintiffs to receive only [[injunctive relief]] (a court order requiring the public accommodation to remedy violations of the accessibility regulations) and attorneys' fees, and does not provide monetary rewards to private plaintiffs who sue non-compliant businesses. Unless a state law, such as the California [[Unruh Civil Rights Act]],&lt;ref name="time ada"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1866666,00.html |title=Lawsuits by the Disabled: Abuse of the System? |author=Stateman, Alison |accessdate=December 29, 2008 |work=Time |date=December 29, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230050557/http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0%2C8599%2C1866666%2C00.html |archivedate=December 30, 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; provides for monetary damages to private plaintiffs, persons with disabilities do not obtain direct financial benefits from suing businesses that violate the ADA.

The attorneys' fees provision of Title III does provide incentive for lawyers to specialize and engage in serial ADA litigation, but a disabled plaintiff does not obtain financial reward from attorneys' fees unless they act as their own attorney, or as mentioned above, a disabled plaintiff resides in a state that provides for minimum compensation and court fees in lawsuits. Moreover, there may be a benefit to these "private attorneys general" who identify and compel the correction of illegal conditions: they may increase the number of public accommodations accessible to persons with disabilities. "Civil rights law depends heavily on private enforcement. Moreover, the inclusion of penalties and damages is the driving force that facilitates voluntary compliance with the ADA."&lt;ref&gt;Parr v. L &amp; L Drive-Inn Restaurant (D. Hawaii 2000) 96&amp;nbsp;F.Supp.2d 1065, 1082, citing and quoting, Committee Print, Vol. II, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., at 1481–82 (1990); {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12101}}(b)(2); S.Rep. No. 101-116, at 15 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Courts have noted: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;As a result, most ADA suits are brought by a small number of private plaintiffs who view themselves as champions of the disabled. For the ADA to yield its promise of equal access for the disabled, it may indeed be necessary and desirable for committed individuals to bring serial litigation advancing the time when public accommodations will be compliant with the ADA."&lt;ref&gt;Molski v. Evergreen Dynasty Corp., (9th Cir. 2007) 500&amp;nbsp;F.3d 1047, 1062; D'Lil v. Best Western Encina Lodge &amp; Suites (9th Cir. 2008) 538&amp;nbsp;F.3d 1031, 1040.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in states that have enacted laws that allow private individuals to win monetary awards from non-compliant businesses (as of 2008, these include California, Florida, Hawaii, and Illinois), "professional plaintiffs" are typically found. At least one of these plaintiffs in California has been barred by courts from filing lawsuits unless he receives prior court permission.&lt;ref name="time ada"/&gt; Through the end of fiscal year 1998, 86% of the 106,988 ADA charges filed with and resolved by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], were either dropped or investigated and dismissed by EEOC but not without imposing opportunity costs and legal fees on employers.&lt;ref name="deleire" /&gt;

==Case law==
{{see also|ADA Litigation in the United States}}
There have been some notable cases regarding the ADA. For example, two major hotel room marketers (Expedia.com and Hotels.com) with their business presence on the Internet were sued because its customers with disabilities could not reserve hotel rooms, through their websites without substantial extra efforts that persons without disabilities were not required to perform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dralegal.org/cases/private_business/Smith_v_Hotels_com.php Smith v.

Garrett|link=|volume=531|page=356|pin=|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case about [[United States Congress|Congress's]] [[congressional power of enforcement|enforcement powers]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. It decided that Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act was unconstitutional insofar as it allowed private citizens to sue states for [[money damages]].

===''Barden v. The City of Sacramento''===

''Barden v. The City of Sacramento'', filed in March 1999, claimed that the City of Sacramento failed to comply with the ADA when, while making public street improvements, it did not bring its sidewalks into compliance with the ADA. Certain issues were resolved in Federal Court. One issue, whether sidewalks were covered by the ADA, was appealed to the [[9th Circuit Court of Appeals]], which ruled that sidewalks were a "program" under ADA and must be made accessible to persons with disabilities. The ruling was later appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case, letting stand the ruling of the 9th Circuit Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dralegal.org/cases/public_entities/barden_v_sacramento.php Barden v.

===''Bates v. UPS''===

''Bates v. UPS'' (begun in 1999) was the first [[equal opportunity employment]] class action brought on behalf of Deaf and Hard of Hearing (d/Deaf/HoH) workers throughout the country concerning workplace discrimination. It established legal precedence for d/Deaf/HoH Employees and Customers to be fully covered under the ADA. Key findings included
# UPS failed to address communication barriers and to ensure equal conditions and opportunities for deaf employees;
# Deaf employees were routinely excluded from workplace information, denied opportunities for promotion, and exposed to unsafe conditions due to lack of accommodations by UPS;
# UPS also lacked a system to alert these employees as to emergencies, such as fires or chemical spills, to ensure that they would safely evacuate their facility; and
# UPS had no policy to ensure that deaf applicants and employees actually received effective communication in the workplace.
The outcome was that UPS agreed to pay a $5.8 million award and agreed to a comprehensive accommodations program that was implemented in their facilities throughout the country.

===''Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd.''===
''[[Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd.|link=|volume=545|page=119|pin=|year=2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a case that was decided by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 2005. The defendant argued that as a vessel flying the flag of a foreign nation it was exempt from the requirements of the ADA. This argument was accepted by a federal court in Florida and, subsequently, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the ruling of the lower courts on the basis that Norwegian Cruise Lines was a business headquartered in the United States whose clients were predominantly Americans and, more importantly, operated out of port facilities throughout the United States.

===''Olmstead v. L.C.''===
{{distinguish|text=[[Olmstead v. United States]], 277 U.S. 438 (1928), a case regarding wiretapping}}

''[[Olmstead v. L.C.]]''&lt;ref name=Olmstead&gt;{{ussc|name=Olmstead v. L.C.|link=|volume=527|page=581|pin=|year=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a case before the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1999. The two plaintiffs L.C. and E.W. were institutionalized in Georgia for diagnosed mental retardation and schizophrenia. Clinical assessments by the state determined that the plaintiffs could be appropriately treated in a community setting rather than the state institution. The plaintiffs sued the state of Georgia and the institution for being inappropriately treated and housed in the institutional setting rather than being treated in one of the state's community based treatment facilities.

The Supreme Court decided under Title II of the ADA that mental illness is a form of disability and therefore covered under the ADA, and that unjustified institutional isolation of a person with a disability is a form of discrimination because it "...perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life." The court added, "Confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment."

Therefore, under Title II no person with a disability can be unjustly excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs or activities of any public entity.&lt;ref name=Olmstead/&gt;

===''Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America v. The University of Michigan''===

This was a case filed before The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division on behalf of the Michigan [[Paralyzed Veterans of America]] against University of Michigan – Michigan Stadium claiming that [[Michigan Stadium]] violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in its $226-million renovation by failing to add enough seats for disabled fans or accommodate the needs for disabled restrooms, concessions and parking. Additionally, the distribution of the accessible seating was at issue, with nearly all the seats being provided in the end-zone areas. The U.S. Department of Justice assisted in the suit filed by attorney Richard Bernstein of [[The Law Offices of Sam Bernstein]] in Farmington Hills, Michigan, which was settled in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Erb, Robin. "U-M fans rave about new seats for disabled", Detroit Free Press. September 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement required the stadium to add 329 wheelchair seats throughout the stadium by 2010, and an additional 135 accessible seats in clubhouses to go along with the existing 88 wheelchair seats. This case was significant because it set a precedent for the uniform distribution of accessible seating and gave the DOJ the opportunity to clarify previously unclear rules.&lt;ref name=wolffe&gt;Wolffe, Jerry. "New wheelchair seats will be full at U-M's Big House." The Oakland Press. September 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement now is a blueprint for all stadiums and other public facilities regarding accessibility.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Wolffe, Jerry. "New wheelchair seats will be full at U-M's Big House", The Oakland Press. September 14, 2008. /&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Paralyzed Veterans of America v. Ellerbe Becket Architects and Engineers''===

One of the first major ADA lawsuits, ''Paralyzed Veterans of America (or "PVA") v. Ellerbe Becket Architects and Engineers'' (1996) was focused on the wheelchair accessibility of a stadium project that was still in the design phase, MCI Center (now known as [[Capital One Arena]]) in Washington, D.C. Previous to this case, which was filed only five years after the ADA was passed, the DOJ was unable or unwilling to provide clarification on the distribution requirements for accessible wheelchair locations in large assembly spaces. While Section 4.33.3 of ADAAG makes reference to lines of sight, no specific reference is made to seeing over standing patrons. The MCI Center, designed by Ellerbe Becket Architects &amp; Engineers, was designed with too few wheelchair and companion seats, and the ones that were included did not provide sight lines that would enable the wheelchair user to view the playing area while the spectators in front of them were standing. This case and another related case established precedent on seat distribution and sight lines issues for ADA enforcement that continues to present day.

===''Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams''===
''[[Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams]]'',&lt;ref name=Toyota&gt;{{ussc|name=Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams|link=|volume=534|page=184|pin=|year=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a case in which the Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of the phrase "substantially impairs" as used in the Americans with Disabilities Act. It reversed a Sixth Court of Appeals decision to grant a partial [[summary judgment]] in favor of the respondent, Ella Williams, that qualified her inability to perform manual job-related tasks as a disability. The Court held that the "major life activity" definition in evaluating the performance of manual tasks focuses the inquiry on whether Williams was unable to perform a range of tasks central to most people in carrying out the activities of daily living. The issue is not whether Williams was unable to perform her specific job tasks. Therefore, the determination of whether an impairment rises to the level of a disability is not limited to activities in the workplace solely, but rather to manual tasks in life in general. When the Supreme Court applied this standard, it found that the Court of Appeals had incorrectly determined the presence of a disability because it relied solely on her inability to perform specific manual work tasks, which was insufficient in proving the presence of a disability. The Court of Appeals should have taken into account the evidence presented that Williams retained the ability to do personal tasks and household chores, such activities being the nature of tasks most people do in their daily lives, and placed too much emphasis on her job disability. Since the evidence showed that Williams was performing normal daily tasks, it ruled that the Court of Appeals erred when it found that Williams was disabled.&lt;ref name=Toyota/&gt;&lt;ref name="workerrights"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GGRFPMUFUSkC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=TOYOTA+of+KY+v+Ella+WILLIAMS#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Workers' Rights |publisher=books.google.com |accessdate=October 7, 2009 |last=Worth |first=Richard |isbn=978-0-7614-2574-8 |date=November 15, 2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling is now, however, no longer good law—it was invalidated by the ADAAA. In fact, Congress explicitly cited Toyota v. Williams in the text of the ADAAA itself as one of its driving influences for passing the ADAAA.

=== ''US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett'' ===
Decided by the US Supreme Court in 2002, this case &lt;ref name="USABARN"&gt;{{ussc|name=US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett|link=|volume=535|page=391|pin=|year=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; held that even requests for accommodation that might seem reasonable on their face, e.g., a transfer to a different position, can be rendered unreasonable because it would require a violation of the company's seniority system.  While the court held that, in general, a violation of a seniority system renders an otherwise reasonable accommodation unreasonable, a plaintiff can present evidence that, despite the seniority system, the accommodation is reasonable in the specific case at hand, e.g., the plaintiff could offer evidence that the seniority system is so often disregarded that another exception wouldn't make a difference.

Importantly, the court held that the defendant need not provide proof that this particular application of the seniority system should prevail, and that, once the defendant showed that the accommodation violated the seniority system, it fell to Barnett to show it was nevertheless reasonable.

In this case, Barnett was a US Airways employee who injured his back, rendering him physically unable to perform his cargo-handling job.  Invoking seniority, he transferred to a less-demanding mailroom job, but this position later became open to seniority-based bidding and was bid on by more senior employees.  Barnett requested the accommodation of being allowed to stay on in the less-demanding mailroom job.  US Airways denied his request, and he lost his job.

The Supreme Court decision invalidated both the approach of the district court, which found that the mere presence and importance of the seniority system was enough to warrant a summary judgment in favor of US Airways, as well as the circuit court's approach that interpreted 'reasonable accommodation' as 'effective accommodation.'

===''Access Now v. Southwest Airlines''===

''[[Access Now v. Southwest Airlines]]'' was a case where the [[United States district court|District Court]] decided that the website of [[Southwest Airlines]] was not in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, because the ADA is concerned with things with a physical existence and thus cannot be applied to cyberspace. Judge [[Patricia A. Seitz]] found that the "virtual ticket counter" of the website was a virtual construct, and hence not a "public place of accommodation." As such, "To expand the ADA to cover 'virtual' spaces would be to create new rights without well-defined standards."&lt;ref name="CLR"&gt;{{cite web |title=Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss |work=Tech Law Journal |url=http://www.techlawjournal.com/courts2002/accessnow_southwest/20021018.asp |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ouellette v. Viacom International Inc.''===

''[[Ouellette v. Viacom International Inc.]]'' followed in Access Now's footsteps by holding that a mere online presence does not subject a website to the ADA guidelines. Thus Myspace and YouTube were not liable for a dyslexic man's inability to navigate the site regardless of how impressive the "online theater" is.

===''Authors Guild v. HathiTrust''===

[[Freethought]] is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] viewpoint that holds opinions should be formed on the basis of [[logic]], [[reason]] and [[empiricism]], rather than [[authority]], [[tradition]], or other [[dogma]]s.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freethinker |title=Freethinker - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2014-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/free+thought |title=Free thought &amp;#124; Define Free thought at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117115830/http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf|date=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cognitive application of freethought is known as "freethinking" and practitioners of freethought are known as "freethinkers".&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |title=Nontracts - FFRF Publications |publisher=Archive.is |date= |accessdate=2014-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804135530/http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |archivedate=2012-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Argument from authority]] ([[Latin]]: ''argumentum ab auctoritate'') is a common form of argument which leads to a [[logical fallacy]] when misused. In informal reasoning, the appeal to authority is a form of argument attempting to establish a [[statistical syllogism]].&lt;ref name="salmon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salmon |first=M. H. |title=Introduction to Critical Reasoning |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Mason, OH |year=2006 |pages=118–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal to authority relies on an argument of the form:
: A is an authority on a particular topic
: A says something about that topic
: A is probably correct

Fallacious examples of using the appeal include any appeal to authority used in the context of [[logical]] reasoning and appealing to the position of an authority or authorities to dismiss evidence as while authorities can be correct in judgments related to their area of expertise more often than laypersons, they can still come to the wrong judgments through error, bias, dishonesty, or falling prey to [[groupthink]]. Thus, the appeal to authority is not a generally reliable argument for establishing facts. Influential anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] thought the following: "Does it follow that I reject all authority? Far from me such a thought. In the matter of boots, I refer to the authority of the bootmaker; concerning houses, canals, or railroads, I consult that of the architect or the engineer. For such or such special knowledge I apply to such or such a savant. But I allow neither the bootmaker nor the architect nor savant to impose his authority upon me. I listen to them freely and with all the respect merited by their intelligence, their character, their knowledge, reserving always my incontestable right of criticism and censure. I do not content myself with consulting a single authority in any special branch; I consult several; I compare their opinions, and choose that which seems to me the soundest. But I recognise no infallible authority, even in special questions; consequently, whatever respect I may have for the honesty and the sincerity of such or such individual, I have no absolute faith in any person".&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/various/authrty.htm "What is Authority?" by Mikhail Bakunin]&lt;/ref&gt; He saw that "there is no fixed and constant authority, but a continual exchange of mutual, temporary, and, above all, voluntary authority and subbordination. This same reason forbids me, then, to recognise a fixed, constant and universal authority, because there is no universal man, no man capable of grasping in all that wealth of detail, without which the application of science to life is impossible, all the sciences, all the branches of social life".&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt;

After [[World War II]], there was a strong sense of anti-authoritarianism based on [[anti-fascism]] in Europe. This was attributed to the active resistance from [[German-occupied Europe|occupation]] and to fears arising from the development of [[superpower]]s.&lt;ref name="swcjsb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sign Wars: The Culture Jammers Strike Back! |last=Cox |first=David |year=2005 |publisher=LedaTape Organisation |isbn=978-0-9807701-5-5 |page=108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zKo8DrmamAwC |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-authoritarianism has also been associated with [[countercultural]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] movements. In the 1950s, the [[Beat Generation]] were politically radical and to some degree their anti-authoritarian attitudes were taken up by activists in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/beatgeneration.html "The American Novel" at [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] website]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hippie movement|hippie]] and larger [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] movements of the 1960s carried out a way of life and activism which was ideally carried through anti-authoritarian and [[non-violent]] means. It was observed as such: "The way of the hippie is antithetical to all repressive hierarchical power structures since they are adverse to the hippie goals of peace, love and freedom... Hippies don't impose their beliefs on others. Instead, hippies seek to change the world through reason and by living what they believe".&lt;ref name="Stonepolitics"&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "The Way of the Hippy"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, anti-authoritarianism became associated with the [[punk subculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = McLaughlin | first = Paul | title = Anarchism and Authority | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-7546-6196-2 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4723">The '''Barcelona Charter''', in full the '''European Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Traditional Ships in Operation''' is an informal but widely accepted [[Technical standard|standard]] for maintenance and [[Conservation-restoration|restoration]] projects on [[historic watercraft]] that are still in operation as active [[sailing ship|sailing vessels]].

== Background ==
More than a thousand historic [[watercraft]] of all sizes are still in operation in [[Europe]]. Only a small number of them are registered monuments or real [[museum ships]], while nearly all of them have a certain historic or [[cultural value]] in the context of [[Maritime history|maritime]] or [[regional history]]. The wide majority of historic watercraft are owned and operated by private owners, associations, foundations etc. 
[[European Maritime Heritage]], the European [[umbrella organization]] for [[traditional vessel]]s in operation, decided to develop a code of best practice for the conservation and restoration of such vessels to safeguard the historic value of these vessels and to define minimum methodological standards for any work to be carried out on these vessels.
A working group mainly consisting of [[Arne Gotved]], [[John Robinson (Barcelona Charter)|John Robinson]] and the professional maritime historian [[Ingo Heidbrink]] drafted the text of the Charter which was finally adopted by European Maritime Heritage in 2003.

== Contents ==
The Barcelona Charter describes in a few paragraphs how conservation and restoration of traditional [[ship]]s in operation should be done. The basic principles are developed on the basis of the [[Venice Charter|Charter of Venice]] and include for example the requirement for proper documentation of all work carried out as well as proper historical background research as a basis for all work to be done. The aim of all paragraphs is to safeguard the particular historic value of a vessel for future generations although the vessel is still in operation and therefore certain safety-regulations of today have to be matched.
The original text of the Charter was written in [https://web.archive.org/web/20080513173350/http://www.european-maritime-heritage.org/EMHsite/Cultural%20Council/barcelona%20charter.htm English], but unofficial translations are available for a number of European languages ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080513173350/http://www.european-maritime-heritage.org/EMHsite/Cultural%20Council/barcelona%20charter.htm Catalan, Dutch, French, German and Portuguese]). 
A detailed commentary on all paragraphs of the Charter was developed by the maritime historian [[Ingo Heidbrink]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingo Heidbrink (ed.), The Barcelona Charter, European Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Traditional Ships in Operation. Bremen (Hauschild Vlg) 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevance ==
Although the Barcelona Charter is not a binding legal instrument it is widely accepted as a code of best practice and is recognized by several European marine safety authorities as well as national owner organizations of historic watercraft.
Despite the fact that the Barcelona Charter was written mainly as a European Charter the principles of the Charter can be applied globally and were for example published by the National Research Institute for Restoration and Conservation of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Institute for Cultural Properties, Tokyo, Conservation of Vessels, Tokyo (Office Hans)2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''referendum on the Charter of National Unity''' was held in [[Burundi]] on 9 February 1991. The charter would abolish ethnic discrimination and give a mandate for the government to write a new constitution. It was approved by 89.77% of voters with a 96% turnout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/bi.html#1991_Referendum Elections in Burundi] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Charter's approval, work began on the drafting of a new constitution which was approved in a [[Burundi constitutional referendum, 1992|referendum]] held on 9 March 1992. It was promulgated on 13 March 1992.

'''CITES''' (the '''Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora''', also known as the '''Washington Convention''') is a [[multilateral treaty]] to protect endangered plants and animals. It was drafted as a result of a resolution adopted in 1963 at a meeting of members of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). The convention was opened for signature in 1973 and CITES entered into force on 1 July 1975. Its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten the survival of the species in the wild, and it accords varying degrees of protection to more than 35,000 [[species]] of animals and plants. In order to ensure that the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) was not violated, the Secretariat of GATT was consulted during the drafting process.&lt;ref name="what_is_cites"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/what.php |title=What is CITES?|work=cites.org|publisher=CITES|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2015}}, Secretary-General of the CITES Secretariat is [[John E. Scanlon]].

== Background and operation ==
CITES is one of the largest and oldest conservation and sustainable use agreements in existence. Participation is voluntary, and countries that have agreed to be bound by the Convention are known as Parties. Although CITES is legally binding on the Parties, it does not take the place of national laws. Rather it provides a framework respected by each Party, which must adopt their own domestic legislation to implement CITES at the national level.  Often, domestic legislation is either non-existent (especially in Parties that have not ratified it), or with penalties  with the gravity of the crime and insufficient deterrents to wildlife traders.&lt;ref name=Zimmerman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/publications/journal-of-transnational-law/archives/volume-36-number-5/download.aspx?id=1907|title=Zimmerman, "The Black Market for Wildlife: llegal Wildlife Trade," ''Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law'' 36 (5) 1657-1689 (November 2003)|accessdate=23 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621160652/http://law.vanderbilt.edu/publications/journal-of-transnational-law/archives/volume-36-number-5/download.aspx?id=1907|archivedate=21 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2002, 50% of Parties lacked one or more of the four major requirements for a Party: designation of Management and Scientific Authorities; laws prohibiting the trade in violation of CITES; penalties for such trade; laws providing for the confiscation of specimens.&lt;ref name=Reeve&gt;Reeve, Policing International Trade in Endangered Species: The CITES Treaty and agreement.  London: Earthscan, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the activities of the Secretariat and Conference of the Parties (CoP) meetings comes from a Trust Fund derived from Party contributions.  Trust Fund money is not available to Parties to improve implementation or compliance. These activities, and all those outside Secretariat activities (training, species specific programmes such as Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants - MIKE) must find external funding, mostly from donor countries and regional organizations such as the European Union.

Although the Convention itself does not provide for arbitration or dispute in the case of noncompliance, 36 years of CITES in practice has resulted in several strategies to deal with infractions by Parties. The Secretariat, when informed of an infraction by a Party, will notify all other parties. The Secretariat will give the Party time to respond to the allegations and may provide technical assistance to prevent further infractions. Other actions the Convention itself does not provide for but that derive from subsequent COP resolutions may be taken against the offending Party. These include:
*Mandatory confirmation of all permits by the Secretariat
*Suspension of cooperation from the Secretariat
*A formal warning
*A visit by the Secretariat to verify capacity
*Recommendations to all Parties to suspend CITES related trade with the offending party&lt;ref name="cites_suspend"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cites.org/eng/resources/ref/suspend.php|title=Countries currently subject to a recommendation to suspend trade|publisher=CITES|work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dictation of corrective measures to be taken by the offending Party before the Secretariat will resume cooperation or recommend resumption of trade
Bilateral sanctions have been imposed on the basis of national legislation (e.g. the USA used certification under the Pelly Amendment to get Japan to revoke its reservation to hawksbill turtle products in 1991, thus reducing the volume of its exports).

Infractions may include negligence with respect to permit issuing, excessive trade, lax enforcement, and  failing to produce annual reports (the most common).

Originally, CITES addressed depletion resulting from demand for luxury goods such as furs in Western countries, but with the rising wealth of Asia, particularly in China, the focus changed to products demanded there, particularly those used for luxury goods such as ivory or shark fins or for superstitious purposes such as rhinoceros horn. As of 2013 the demand was massive and had expanded to include thousands of species previously considered unremarkable and in no danger of extinction such as [[manta ray]]s or [[pangolin]]s.&lt;ref name=NYT031313&gt;{{cite news|title=No Species Is Safe From Burgeoning Wildlife Trade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/world/asia/no-species-is-safe-from-burgeoning-wildlife-trade.html|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 March 2013|author=Bettina Wassener}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ratifications==
[[File:CITES.svg|thumb|300px|Parties to the treaty. [[Greenland]] is covered by CITES regulations through [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=DMK/&gt;]]
The text of the Convention was finalized at a meeting of representatives of 80 countries in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, on 3 March 1973. It was then open for signature until 31 December 1974. It entered into force after the 10th ratification by a signatory country, on 1 July 1975. Countries that signed the Convention become Parties by ratifying, accepting or approving it. By the end of 2003, all signatory countries had become Parties. States that were not signatories may become Parties by acceding to the Convention. As of October 2016, the Convention has 183 parties, including 182 states and the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/parties/chronolo.php|title=List of Contracting Parties - CITES|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CITES Convention includes provisions and rules for trade with non-Parties. All member states of the [[United Nations]] are party to the treaty, with the exception of [[Andorra]], [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Haiti]], [[Kiribati]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Nauru]], [[South Sudan]], [[Timor-Leste]], [[Tonga]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Tuvalu]]. UN observer the [[Holy See]] is also not a member. The [[Faroe Islands]], an autonomous country in the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], is also treated as a non-Party to CITES (both the Danish mainland and [[Greenland]] are part of CITES).&lt;ref name=DMK&gt;CITES: [http://www.cites.org/eng/cms/index.php/component/cp/country/DK Denmark.] Retrieved 24 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CITES: [http://www.cites.org/eng/cms/index.php/component/cp/country/FO Faroe Islands.] Retrieved 24 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

An amendment to the text of the Convention, known as the Gaborone Amendment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaborone amendment to the text of the Convention|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/gaborone.php |publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows regional economic integration organizations (REIO), such as the [[European Union]], to have the status of a member state and to be a Party to the Convention.  The REIO can vote at CITES meetings with the number of votes representing the number of members in the REIO, but it does not have an additional vote.

In accordance with Article XVII, paragraph 3, of the CITES Convention, the Gaborone Amendment entered into force on 29 November 2013, 60 days after 54 (two-thirds) of the 80 States that were party to CITES on 30 April 1983 deposited their instrument of acceptance of the amendment.  At that time it entered into force only for those States that had accepted the amendment. The amended text of the Convention will apply automatically to any State that becomes a Party after 29 November 2013. For States that became party to the Convention before that date and have not accepted the amendment, it will enter into force 60 days after they accept it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/gaborone.php|title=Gaborone amendment to the text of the Convention - CITES|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation of trade==
CITES works by subjecting international trade in specimens of selected species to certain controls. All import, export, re-export and introduction from the sea of species covered by the Convention has to be authorized through a licensing system. According to Article IX of the Convention, Management and Scientific Authorities, each Party to the Convention must designate one or more Management Authorities in charge of administering that licensing system and one or more Scientific Authorities to advise them on the effects of trade on the status of CITES-listed species.

==Appendices==

Roughly 5,000 species of animals and 29,000 species of plants are protected by CITES against [[over-exploitation]] through international trade. Each protected species or population is included in one of three lists, called appendices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php|title=Appendices I, II and III|author=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora|year=2013|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cites.org/eng/app/index.php|title=The CITES Appendices|author=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora|year=|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (explained below). The Appendix that lists a species or population reflects the extent of the threat to it and the controls that apply to the trade.

Species may be split-listed meaning that some populations of a species are on one Appendix, while some are on another.  Some people argue that this is risky as specimens from a more protected population could be 'laundered' through the borders of a Party whose population is not as strictly protected.  The [[African bush elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana'') is currently split-listed, with all populations except those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe listed in Appendix I.  Those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are listed in Appendix II.  Listing the species over the whole of its range would prevent such 'laundering' but also restricts trade in wildlife products by [[range states]] with good management practices. There are also species that have only some populations listed in an Appendix. One example is the [[pronghorn]] (''Antilocapra americana''), a ruminant native to North America. Its Mexican population is listed in Appendix I, but its U.S. and Canadian populations are not listed (though certain U.S. populations in Arizona are nonetheless protected under the [[Endangered Species Act]]).

Species are proposed for inclusion in or deletion from the Appendices at meetings of the Conference of the Parties (CoP), which are held approximately once every three years, the most recent of which was CoP (CoP 17) in [[Johannesburg, South Africa]]  from 24 September to 5 October 2016 at the Sandton Convention Center.&lt;ref name="CITES-Calendar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/news/calendar.php |title=CITES Calendar |publisher=CITES|work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species in the Appendices may be proposed for addition, change of Appendix, or de-listing (i.e., deletion) by any Party, whether or not it is a range State and changes may be made despite objections by range States if there is sufficient (2/3 majority) support for the listing.  These discussions are usually among the most contentious at CoP meetings.

There has been increasing willingness within the Parties to allow for trade in products from well-managed populations.  For instance, sales of the South African white rhino have generated revenues that helped pay for protection.  Listing the species on Appendix I increased the price of rhino horn (which fueled more poaching), but the species survived wherever there was adequate on-the-ground protection. Thus field protection may be the primary mechanism that saved the population, but it is likely that field protection would not have been increased without CITES protection.&lt;ref name=Hutton&gt;Hutton and Dickinson, Endangered Species Threatened Convention: The Past, Present and Future of CITES. London: Africa Resources Trust, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appendix I===
Appendix I, about 1200 species, are species that are threatened with extinction and are or may be affected by trade. Commercial trade in wild-caught specimens of these species is illegal (permitted only in exceptional licensed circumstances). Captive-bred animals or cultivated plants of Appendix I species are considered Appendix II specimens, with concomitant requirements (see below and Article VII).  The Scientific Authority of the exporting country must make a non-detriment finding, assuring that export of the individuals will not adversely affect the wild population.  Any trade in these species requires export and import permits. The Management Authority of the exporting state is expected to check that an import permit has been secured and that the importing state is able to care for the specimen adequately. Notable animal species listed in Appendix I include the [[red panda]] (''Ailurus fulgens''), [[western gorilla]] (''Gorilla gorilla''), the [[chimpanzee]] species (''Pan spp.''), [[tiger]]s (''Panthera tigris'' subspecies), [[Asiatic lion]] (''Panthera leo persica''), [[leopards]] (''Panthera pardus''), [[jaguar]] (''Panthera onca''), [[cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus''), [[Asian elephant]] (''Elephas maximus''), some populations of [[African bush elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana''), the [[dugong]] and [[manatee]]s ([[Sirenia]]), and all [[rhinoceros]] species (except some Southern African subspecies populations).&lt;ref name="CITES-Appendices"&gt;{{cite web|title=Appendices I, II and III |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php|publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appendix II===
Appendix II, about 21,000 species, are species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilization incompatible with the survival of the species in the wild.  In addition, Appendix II can include species similar in appearance to species already listed in the Appendices.  International trade in specimens of Appendix II species may be authorized by the granting of an export permit or re-export certificate.  In practice, many hundreds of thousands of Appendix II animals are traded annually.&lt;ref name="CITES-Quotas"&gt;{{cite web|title=CITES Export Quotas |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.php|publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No import permit is necessary for these species under CITES, although some Parties do require import permits as part of their stricter domestic measures.  A non-detriment finding and export permit are required by the exporting Party.&lt;ref name="CITES-Appendices"/&gt;

In addition, Article VII of CITES states that specimens of animals listed in Appendix I that are bred in captivity for commercial purposes are treated as Appendix II. The same applies for specimens of Appendix I plants artificially propagated for commercial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/text.php#VII |title=Article VII: Exemptions and Other Special Provisions Relating to Trade |work=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora |publisher=CITES |accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of species listed on Appendix II are the [[great white shark]] (''Carcharodon carcharias''), the [[American black bear]] (''Ursus americanus''), [[Hartmann's mountain zebra]] (''Equus zebra hartmannae''), [[green iguana]] (''Iguana iguana''), [[queen conch]] (''Strombus gigas''), [[Emperor scorpion]] (''Pandinus imperator''), [[Mertens' water monitor]] (''Varanus mertensi''), bigleaf mahogany (''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]'') and [[lignum vitae]] "ironwood" (''Guaiacum officinale'').

===Appendix III===
Appendix III, about 170 species, are species that are listed after one member country has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling trade in a species.  The species are not necessarily threatened with extinction globally.  In all member countries, trade in these species is only permitted with an appropriate export permit and a certificate of origin from the state of the member country who has listed the species.&lt;ref name="CITES-Appendices" /&gt;

Examples of species listed on Appendix III and the countries that listed them are the [[two-toed sloth]]  (''Choloepus hoffmanni'') by Costa Rica, [[sitatunga]] (Tragelaphus Spekii) by Ghana, [[African civet]] (''Civettictis civetta'') by Botswana, and [[alligator snapping turtle]] by the USA.

==Amendments and reservations==
Amendments to the Convention must be supported by a two-thirds majority who are "present and voting" and can be made during an extraordinary meeting of the COP if one-third of the Parties are interested in such a meeting.  The Gaborone Amendment (1983) allows regional economic blocs to accede to the treaty.  Reservations (Article XXIII) can be made by any Party with respect to any species, which considerably weakens the treaty (see [http://www.cites.org/eng/app/reserve.php ] for current reservations).  Trade with non-Party states is allowed, although permits and certificates are recommended to be issued by exporters and sought by importers.

Notable reservations include those by [[Iceland]], [[Japan]] and [[Norway]] on various [[baleen]] whale species and those on [[Falconiformes]] by Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="CITES-Reservations"&gt;{{cite web|title=CITES Reservations Entered by Parties |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/reserve.php|publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortcomings and concerns==

===Approach to biodiversity conservation===
General limitations about the structure and philosophy of CITES include: by design and intent it focuses on trade at the species level and does not address habitat loss, [[ecosystem approach]]es to conservation, or poverty; it seeks to prevent unsustainable use rather than promote sustainable use (which generally conflicts with the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]), although this has been changing (see [[Nile crocodile]], [[African elephant]], South African [[white rhino]] case studies in Hutton and Dickinson 2000). It does not explicitly address market demand.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;Hill, 1990, "The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species: Fifteen Years Later," ''Loyola of Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Journal'' 13: 231&lt;/ref&gt; Funding does not provide for increased on-the-ground enforcement (it must apply for bilateral aid for most projects of this nature).

===Drafting===
By design, CITES regulates and monitors trade in the manner of a "negative list" such that trade in all species is permitted and unregulated ''unless'' the species in question appears on the Appendices or looks very much like one of those taxa. Then and only then, trade is regulated or constrained.  Because the remit of the Convention covers millions of species of plants and animals, and tens of thousands of these taxa are potentially of economic value, in practice this negative list approach effectively forces CITES signatories to expend limited resources on just a select few, leaving many species to be traded with neither constraint nor review.  For example, recently several bird classified as [[IUCN Red List|threatened with extinction]] appeared in the legal wild bird trade because the CITES process never considered their status.  If a "positive list" approach were taken, only species evaluated and approved for the positive list would be permitted in trade, thus lightening the review burden for member states and the Secretariat, and also preventing inadvertent legal trade threats to poorly known species.

Specific weaknesses in the text include: it does not stipulate guidelines for the 'non-detriment' finding required of national Scientific Authorities; non-detriment findings require copious amounts of information; the 'household effects' clause is often not rigid enough/specific enough to prevent CITES violations by means of this Article (VII); non-reporting from Parties means Secretariat monitoring is incomplete; and it has no capacity to address domestic trade in listed species.

===Reform suggestions===
Suggestions for improvement in the operation of CITES include: more regular missions by the Secretariat (not reserved just for high-profile species); improvement of national legislation and enforcement; better reporting by Parties (and the consolidation of information from all sources-NGOs, [[TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network]] and Parties); more emphasis on enforcement-including a technical committee enforcement officer; the development of CITES Action Plans (akin to Biodiversity Action Plans related to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]) including: designation of Scientific/Management Authorities and national enforcement strategies; incentives for reporting and timelines for both Action Plans and reporting.  CITES would benefit from access to [[Global Environment Facility]] (GEF), funds-although this is difficult given the GEFs more ecosystem approach-or other more regular funds.  Development of a future  mechanism similar to that of the Montreal Protocol (developed nations contribute to a fund for developing nations) could allow more funds for non-Secretariat activities.&lt;ref name="Reeve"/&gt;

On 15 July 2008, the Committee of Environmental Insecticides that oversees the administration of the convention between meetings of all the Parties granted China and Japan permission to import elephant [[ivory]] from four African government stockpiles, the ivory being sold at a single auction in each country. The amounts to be sold comprise approximately 44 tons from Botswana, 9 tons from Namibia, 51 tons from South Africa, and 4 tons from Zimbabwe. The Chinese government in 2003 acknowledged that it had lost track of 121 tons of ivory between 1991 and 2002.

=== [[Traffic (conservation programme)|TRAFFIC]] Data ===
From 2005 &amp;ndash; 2009 the legal trade corresponded with these numbers
* 317,000 live birds
* More than 2 million live reptiles
* 2.5 million crocodile skins
* 2.1 million [[Snakeskin|snake skins]]
* 73 tons of [[caviar]]
* 1.1 million beaver skins
* Millions of pieces of [[coral]]
* 20,000 mammalian [[Trophy hunting|hunting trophies]]
In the 1990s the annual trade of legal animal products was $160 billion annually. In 2009 the estimated value almost doubled to $300 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Ceballos, G.; Ehrlich, A. H.; Ehrlich, P. R. (2015). ''The Annihilation of Nature: Human Extinction of Birds and Mammals''. Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 150. {{ISBN|1421417189}} – via Open Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meetings==
The Conference of the Parties (CoP) is held once every three years.  The last Conference of the Parties (CoP 17) was held in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], and the one before it (CoP 16) was held in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], in 2013.  The next one (CoP 18) will be in [[Sri Lanka]] in 2019.  The location of the next CoP is chosen at the close of each CoP by a secret ballot vote.

The CITES Committees (Animals Committee, Plants Committee and Standing Committee) hold meetings during each year that does not have a CoP, while the Standing committee meets also in years with a CoP.  The Committee meetings take place in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] (where the Secretariat of the CITES Convention is located), unless another country offers to host the meeting.  The Animals and Plants Committees have sometimes held joint meetings.  The previous joint meeting was held in March 2012 in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and the latest one was held in [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], [[Mexico]] in May 2014.

The '''California Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act of 2018''' is a law in [[California]] designed to protect [[net neutrality]].&lt;ref name="gizmodo"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/california-net-neutrality-bill-signed-into-law-1829402679|title=California Net Neutrality Bill Signed Into Law|last=Cameron|first=Dell|date=September 30, 2018|work=[[Gizmodo]]|access-date=October 1, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed into law on September 30, 2018.&lt;ref name="gizmodo" /&gt;

The act prevents [[internet service providers]] from doing the following things:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/07/05/californias-net-neutrality-bill-is-back-tough-ever/|title=California’s net neutrality bill is back and as tough as ever|last=Fung|first=Brian|date=July 5, 2018|website=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blocking lawful traffic
* Slowing lawful traffic
* Receiving payment from an [[edge provider]] for many things
* [[Net bias|Paid-prioritization]]
* Getting paid for [[Zero-rating]]
* Zero-rating some content in a category, but not all content in that category (e.g. zero rating Facebook, but normal treatment for Google Plus)
* Preventing users from using their own devices
* Not being transparent about "network management practices, performance, and commercial terms"
* Trying to sneak around these laws

The act has been lauded as the "gold standard" of net neutrality laws.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/californias-gold-standard-net-neutrality-becomes-law/|title=California's 'gold standard' net neutrality becomes law|last=Reardon|first=Marguerite|date=September 30, 2018|work=[[CNET]]|access-date=October 1, 2018|language=en}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Responses ==
Within hours, the [[United States Department of Justice]] responded by suing the state of California, claiming that states can't have any legislation over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/01/us-justice-department-sues-california-to-over-new-net-neutrality-law|title=US justice department sues California over new net neutrality law|last=|first=|date=September 30, 2018|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; California has said that they will fight the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/09/30/california-governor-signs-model-net-neutrality-bill/|title=California sued by DOJ after governor signs ‘model’ net neutrality bill|last=Sumagaysay|first=Levi|date=September 30, 2018|work=[[The Mercury News]]|access-date=October 1, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Connecticut Probate Court''' system is a system of 54 individual [[probate court]]s located throughout the state of [[Connecticut]]. The jurisdiction of each court extends to the legal affairs of the deceased, estates, some aspects of family law, [[conservatorship]], and several other matters requiring specific legal decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jud.ct.gov/probate/juris.html |title=Probate Court Jurisdiction |publisher=Jud.ct.gov |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617060026/http://www.jud.ct.gov/probate/juris.html |archivedate=June 17, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As statutory courts, all jurisdiction and authority is governed by the [[Connecticut General Assembly|state legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jud.state.ct.us/probate/history.html |title=Probate Court History |publisher=Jud.state.ct.us |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elections of judges==
Judges of probate are the only members of the state judicial branch elected in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="courant1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/2009-09-27/news/ct-probate0927_1_probate-judges-connecticut-s-probate-court-system |title=Probate Courts: 'Historic' Makeover |author=Joseph A. O'Brien |publisher=''[[Hartford Courant]]'' |date=September 27, 2009 |accessdate=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges are elected in [[political party|partisan]] elections and hold office for a term of four years, their elections held within the same cycle as gubernatorial elections.

Previously, laws permitted anyone to run as a candidate for judge of probate regardless of previous judicial or legal experience. However, a state law which went into effect on January 5, 2011 now requires candidates for judge of probate to be both a lawyer and a member of the Connecticut bar.&lt;ref name="courant1"/&gt;

==Consolidation of court districts==
After operating without much change since 1850, growing financial difficulties in the state and within the probate courts created the need for the system to be overhauled. In the summer of 2009, the Probate Court Redistricting Commission assembled to review the aging court system and make recommendations for decreasing the number of judicial districts from 117. In September 2009, the commission announced its consolidation plan to reduce the number of districts to 54&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jud.state.ct.us/probate/Redistrict/54_court_plan.pdf |title=CT 54 Probate Court Plan |publisher=Jud.state.ct.us |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the 2010 elections.

==Probate districts==

{{Politics of Serbia}}
The '''[[Constitutional Court]] of the Republic of Serbia''' ({{lang-sr|Уставни суд Републике Србије; Ustavni sud Republike Srbije}}) is the court authorized to perform [[judicial review]] in [[Serbia]]. It rules on whether the laws, decrees or other bills enacted by the Serbian authorities are in conformity with the [[Constitution of Serbia|Constitution]]. It is not considered as part of the judicial branch, but a court ''[[sui generis]]''. The Constitutional Court is authorized by the Constitution itself and the ''Law on the Constitutional Court''.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Serbia official site: [http://www.ustavni.sud.rs/page/view/en-GB/237-100030/law-on-the-constitutional-court ''Law on the Constitutional Court'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The seat of the Constitutional Court is in [[Belgrade]]. It consists of 15 judges, one of them being President of the Court.&lt;ref name=izbor&gt;Constitutional Court of Serbia official site: [http://www.ustavni.sud.rs/page/view/sr-Latn-CS/42-100016/izbor-imenovanje-i-prestanak-duznosti-sudija ''Election, appointment and termination of office''] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Constitutional Court of the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]] (then part of [[SFR Yugoslavia]]) was established on 9 April 1963 as an independent body of the Republic and designated to protect constitutionality and legality in accordance with the Constitution and within the framework of the rights and duties proscribed by the 1963 [[Constitution of Serbia|Constitution of SR Serbia]]. The ''Constitutional Law of Serbia'', enacted on 25 December 1963, defined jurisdiction and [[adjudication]]s before the Constitutional Court and legal effects of its decisions in a more specific manner.

The Constitutional Court of Serbia commenced its work on 15 February 1964. The Constitutional Court has upon proclamation of the [[Constitution of Serbia|1990 Constitution of Serbia]] acted within the framework of absence of division of powers, where the [[Serbian Parliament|Parliament]] was the highest body of state power. The Constitutional Court has through its presence and work contributed to the importance and contribution in preservation of the constitutional principles and legality.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Serbia official site:  [http://www.ustavni.sud.rs/page/view/en-GB/209-100009/the-history-of-the-court-from-its-foundation ''The history of the court from its foundation'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The Constitutional Court consists of 15 judges. Five of them are elected by the [[President of Serbia]], five by the [[National Assembly of Serbia|National Assembly]], and five are elected at the General Session of the [[Supreme Court of Serbia|Supreme Court of Cassation]]. Judges are elected to the 9-year term. The candidates have to be accomplished lawyers of at least 40 years of age and with at least 15 years of experience in [[jurisprudence]]. One person can be elected to the Court a maximum of two times. After the election, the judges take oath before the [[President of the National Assembly of Serbia|President of the National Assembly]].

The term of the Constitutional Court judge ends after 9 years since the election, or by resignation, by retirement or by [[impeachment]]. A Constitutional Court judge may not perform any other public office or any other job at all, except for being a professor at the Law School of one of the [[List of universities in Serbia|universities in Serbia]]. A Constitutional Court judge enjoys [[immunity from prosecution]].&lt;ref name=izbor/&gt;

'''Contempt of court''', often referred to simply as "'''contempt'''", is the offense of being [[disobedience|disobedient]] to or [[disrespect|discourteous]] toward a [[court]] of law and its officers in the form of behavior that opposes or defies the authority, justice and dignity of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/contempt?q=contempt |title=contempt: definition of contempt in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US) |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date=2014-08-05 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Contempt+of+Court|title=West's Encyclopedia of American Law|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It manifests itself in willful disregard of or disrespect for the authority of a court of law, which is often behavior that is illegal because it does not obey or respect the rules of a law court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/contempt-of-court |title=Always Free Online |publisher=Collins English Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/contempt_2 |title=contempt noun (NOT OBEYING) - definition in the British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date=2014-07-30 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are broadly two categories of contempt: being rude or disrespectful to legal authorities in the courtroom, or willfully failing to obey a court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=325 |title=Legal Dictionary &amp;#124; Law.com |publisher=Dictionary.law.com |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contempt proceedings are especially used to enforce [[Equitable remedy|equitable remedies]], such as [[injunction]]s.&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=2330050 |title=The Myth of the Mild Declaratory Judgment |volume=63 |page=1091 |journal=[[Duke Law Journal]]|first=Samuel |last=Bray|date=2014 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, the refusal to respond to [[subpoena]], to testify, to fulfill the obligations of a juror, or to provide certain information can constitute contempt of the court.

When a court decides that an action constitutes contempt of court, it can issue a [[court order]] that in the context of a court [[trial (law)|trial]] or [[hearing (law)|hearing]] declares a person or organization to have disobeyed or been disrespectful of the [[court]]'s authority, called "found" or "held" in contempt. That is the [[judge]]'s strongest power to impose [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] for acts that disrupt the court's normal process.

A finding of being in contempt of court may result from a failure to obey a lawful order of a court, showing disrespect for the judge, disruption of the proceedings through poor behavior, or publication of material or non-disclosure of material, which in doing so is deemed likely to jeopardize a [[fair trial]]. A judge may impose sanctions such as a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] or [[jail]] for someone found guilty of contempt of court. Judges in [[common law]] systems usually have more extensive power to declare someone in contempt than judges in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems. The client or person must be proven guilty before being punished.

==In use today==
Contempt of court is essentially seen as a form of disturbance that may impede the functioning of the court. The judge may impose fines and/or jail time upon any person committing contempt of court. The person is usually let out upon his or her agreement to fulfill the wishes of the court.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Hill, G. (2008). Contempt of Court. Retrieved April 12, 2008 from, Law.dictionary.com Web site: [http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?typed=contempt&amp;type=1&amp;submit1.x=0&amp;submit1.y=0&amp;submit1=Look+up]&lt;/ref&gt; Civil contempt can involve acts of omission. The judge will make use of warnings in most situations that may lead to a person being charged with contempt. It is relatively rare that a person is charged for contempt without first receiving at least one warning from the judge.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, G. (2008). Contempt of Court. Retrieved April 12, 2008 from , Law.dictionary.com Web site:
[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?typed=contempt&amp;type=1&amp;submit1.x=0&amp;submit1.y=0&amp;submit1=Look+up]&lt;/ref&gt; Constructive contempt, also called ''consequential contempt'', is when a person fails to fulfill the will of the court as it applies to outside obligations of the person. In most cases, constructive contempt is considered to be in the realm of civil contempt due to its passive nature.

Indirect contempt is something that is associated with civil and constructive contempt and involves a failure to follow court orders. Criminal contempt includes anything that could be called a disturbance, such as repeatedly talking out of turn, bringing forth previously banned evidence, or harassment of any other party in the courtroom.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  Direct contempt is an unacceptable act in the presence of the judge (''in facie curiae''), and generally begins with a warning, and may be accompanied by an immediate imposition of punishment. [[Yawning]] in some cases can be considered contempt of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/20/local/me-yawn20|title=Sleepy Juror Gets Rude Awakening|author=Liu, Caitlin|date=April 20, 2005|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]] a judge may impose a fine or jail for contempt of court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsmanual.net/Resources/medialaw_in_australia_03.html |title=Contempt &amp; court reporting in Australia |publisher=Thenewsmanual.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; including for refusing to stand up for a judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-09/disrespectful-court-behaviour-laws-tested-in-new-south-wales/8107300|title=Islamic State recruiter's wife Moutia Elzahed may be first charged under disrespectful behaviour laws|first=Natasha|last=Robinson|website=ABC News|date=9 December 2016|archivedate=9 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161209215419/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-09/disrespectful-court-behaviour-laws-tested-in-new-south-wales/8107300|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

====Common law offence====
In Canada, contempt of court is an exception to the general principle that all criminal offences are set out in the federal [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]. Contempt of court is the only remaining [[common law offence]] in Canada, besides the related offence of [[Contempt of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/legal_compendium/Chapter22.asp A Compendium of Law and Judges]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contempt of court includes the following behaviors:
* Failing to maintain a respectful attitude, failing to remain silent or failing to refrain from showing approval or disapproval of the proceeding
* Refusing or neglecting to obey a subpoena
* Willfully disobeying a process or order of the court
* Interfering with the orderly administration of justice or impairing the authority or dignity of the court
* An officer of the court failing to perform his or her duties
* A sheriff or bailiff not executing a writ of the court forthwith or not making a return thereof

====Canadian Federal courts====
''This section applies only to [[Federal Court of Appeal]] and [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]].''

Under Federal Court Rules, Rules 466, and Rule 467 a person who is accused of Contempt needs to be first served with a contempt order and then appear in court to answer the charges. Convictions can only be made when proof beyond a reasonable doubt is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20030503180331/http://reports.fja.gc.ca/regles/partie12.html Federal Court Rules Chapter 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

If it is a matter of urgency or the contempt was done in front of a judge, that person can be punished immediately. Punishment can range from the person being imprisoned for a period of less than five years or until the person complies with the order or fine.

====Tax Court of Canada====
Under [[Tax Court of Canada]] Rules of ''Tax Court of Canada Act'', a person who is found to be in contempt may be imprisoned for a period of less than two years or fined. Similar procedures for serving an order first is also used at the Tax Court.

====Provincial courts====
Different procedures exist for different provincial courts. For example, in [[British Columbia]], a [[justice of the peace]] can only issue a summons to an offender for contempt, which will be dealt with by a judge, even if the offence was done in the face of the justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/P/96379_01.htm#section31 Provincial Court Act Jurisdiction of justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
Judges from the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]], [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]], [[District Court (Hong Kong)|District Court]] along with members from the various tribunals and Coroner's Court all have the power to impose immediate punishments for contempt in the face of the court, derived from legislation or through [[common law]]:

* Insult a judge or justice, witness or [[officers of the court]]
* Interrupts the proceedings of the court
* Interfere with the course of justice
* Misbehaves in court (e.g., use of [[mobile phone]] or recording devices without permission)
* [[Juror]] who leaves without permission of the court during proceedings
* Disobeying a judgment or court order
* Breach of undertaking
* Breach of a duty imposed upon a solicitor by rules of court

The use of insulting or threatening language in the [[magistrates' court (Hong Kong)|magistrates' courts]] or against a magistrate is in breach of section 99 of the Magistrates Ordinance (Cap 227) which states the magistrate can 'summarily sentence the offender to a fine at level 3 and to imprisonment for 6 months.'

In addition, certain appeal boards are given the statutory authority for contempt by them (e.g., Residential Care Home, Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation, Air Pollution Control, etc.). For contempt in front of these boards, the chairperson will certify the act of contempt to the [[Court of First Instance (Hong Kong)|Court of First Instance]] who will then proceed with a hearing and determine the punishment.

===India===
In India contempt of court is of two types:

{{ordered list
| Civil contempt: Under Section 2(b) of the Contempt of Courts Act of 1971, civil contempt has been defined as wilful disobedience to any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a court or wilful breach of an undertaking given to a court.
| Criminal contempt: Under Section 2(c) of the Contempt of Courts Act of 1971, criminal contempt has been defined as the publication (whether by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever which:{{ordered list| list_style_type= lower-roman
| Scandalises or tends to scandalise, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of, any court, or
| Prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with the due course of any judicial proceeding, or
| Interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner.}}}}
====Punishment====
Six months, or fine up to ₹2000, or both.{{clarify|reason=Is the punishment the same for both types of contempt?|date=April 2018}}

===England and Wales===
In [[England|English]] law (a [[common law]] jurisdiction) the law on contempt is partly set out in case law, and partly specified in the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]]. Contempt may be a [[Crime|criminal]] or [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] offence. The maximum sentence for criminal contempt is two years.

Disorderly, contemptuous, or insolent behavior toward the judge or magistrates while holding the court, tending to interrupt the due course of a trial or other judicial proceeding, may be prosecuted as "direct" contempt. The term "direct" means that the court itself cites the person in contempt by describing the behavior observed on the record. Direct contempt is distinctly different from indirect contempt, wherein another individual may file papers alleging contempt against a person who has willfully violated a lawful court order.

====Criminal contempt of court====
The [[Crown Court]] is a [[Superior court|superior court of record]] under the [[Senior Courts Act 1981]] and accordingly has power to punish for contempt of its own motion. The [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] has stated that this power applies in three circumstances:

# Contempt "in the face of the court" (not to be taken literally; the judge does not need to see it, provided it took place within the court precincts or relates to a case currently before that court);
# Disobedience of a court order; and
# Breaches of undertakings to the court.

Where it is necessary to act quickly the judge (even the trial judge) may act to sentence for contempt.

Where it is not necessary to be so urgent, or where indirect contempt has taken place the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] can intervene and the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] will institute criminal proceedings on his behalf before a Divisional Court of the [[Queen's Bench Division]] of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]].

[[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' court]]s are not superior courts of record, but nonetheless have powers granted under the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]]. They may detain any person who insults the court or otherwise disrupts its proceedings until the end of the sitting. Upon the contempt being either admitted or proved the judge or [[Justice of the peace|JP]] may imprison the offender for a maximum of one month, fine them up to £2,500, or do both.

It is contempt of court to bring an audio recording device or picture-taking device of any sort into an English court without the consent of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/contempt_of_court/|title=Contempt of Court and Reporting Restrictions: Legal Guidance: The Crown Prosecution Service|website=www.cps.gov.uk|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not contempt of court (under section 10 of the Act) for a journalist to refuse to disclose his sources, unless the court has considered the evidence available and determined that the information is "necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime".

====Strict liability contempt====
Under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 it is criminal contempt of court to publish anything which creates a real risk that the course of justice in proceedings may be seriously impaired. It only applies where proceedings are active, and the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] has issued guidance as to when he believes this to be the case, and there is also statutory guidance. The clause prevents the newspapers and media from publishing material that is too extreme or sensationalist about a criminal case until the trial or linked trials are over and the juries have given their verdicts.

Section 2 of the Act limits the [[common law]] presumption that conduct may be treated as contempt regardless of intention: now only cases where there is a substantial risk of serious prejudice to a trial are affected.

====Civil contempt====
In civil proceedings there are two main ways in which contempt is committed:

# Failure to attend at court despite a [[summons#Civil summons|summons]] requiring attendance. In respect of the High Court, historically a [[Latitat|writ of latitat]] would have been issued, but now a [[bench warrant]] is issued, authorizing the [[tipstaff]] to arrange for the arrest of the individual, and imprisonment until the date and time the court appoints to next sit. In practice a groveling letter of apology to the court is sufficient to ward off this possibility, and in any event the warrant is generally "backed for bail"—i.e., [[bail]] will be granted once the arrest has been made and a location where the person can be found in future established.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}
# Failure to comply with a court order. A copy of the order, with a "penal notice"—i.e., notice informing the recipient that if they do not comply they are subject to imprisonment—is served on the person concerned. If, after that, they breach the order, proceedings can be started and in theory the person involved can be sent to prison. In practice this rarely happens as the cost on the claimant of bringing these proceedings is significant and in practice imprisonment is rarely ordered as an apology or fine are usually considered appropriate.

===United States===
In United States [[jurisprudence]], acts of contempt are generally divided into direct or indirect and civil or criminal. Direct contempt occurs in the presence of a judge; civil contempt is "coercive and remedial" as opposed to [[punitive]]. In the United States, relevant statutes include {{usc|18|401|403}} and [[Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure]] 42.&lt;ref&gt;[Doyle C. (2010). [https://opencrs.com/document/RL34303/2010-11-05/ Obstruction of Justice: An Overview of Some of the Federal Statutes That Prohibit Interference with Judicial, Executive, or Legislative Activities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615082208/https://opencrs.com/document/RL34303/2010-11-05/ |date=2013-06-15 }}. ''Congressional Research Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Direct contempt is that which occurs in the presence of the presiding judge (''in facie curiae'') and may be dealt with summarily: the judge notifies the offending party that he or she has acted in a manner which disrupts the tribunal and prejudices the administration of justice. After giving the person the opportunity to respond, the judge may impose the sanction immediately.
# Indirect contempt occurs outside the immediate presence of the court and consists of disobedience of a court's prior order. Generally a party will be accused of indirect contempt by the party for whose benefit the order was entered. A person cited for indirect contempt is entitled to notice of the charge and an opportunity for hearing of the evidence of contempt and, since there is no written procedure, may or may not be allowed to present evidence in rebuttal.

Contempt of court in a [[civil suit]] is generally not considered to be a criminal offense, with the party benefiting from the order also holding responsibility for the enforcement of the order. However, some cases of civil contempt have been perceived as intending to harm the reputation of the plaintiff, or to a lesser degree, the judge or the court.

Sanctions for contempt may be criminal or civil. If a person is to be punished criminally, then the contempt must be proven beyond a [[Legal burden of proof|reasonable doubt]], but once the charge is proven, then punishment (such as a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] or, in more serious cases, imprisonment) is imposed unconditionally. The civil sanction for contempt (which is typically incarceration in the custody of the [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] or similar court officer) is limited in its imposition for so long as the disobedience to the court's order continues: once the party complies with the court's order, the sanction is lifted. The imposed party is said to "hold the keys" to his or her own cell, thus conventional [[due process of law|due process]] is not required. In federal and most state courts, the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] for civil contempt is [[clear and convincing evidence]], a lower standard than in criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TO3y5uG8-6wC&amp;lpg=PT671&amp;dq=civil%20contempt%20clear%20and%20convincing&amp;pg=PT671#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Understanding Remedies|last=Fischer|first=James M.|date=2010-12-07|publisher=LexisNexis|isbn=9781422486559|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In civil contempt cases there is no [[Proportionality (law)|principle of proportionality]]. In ''Chadwick v. Janecka'' (3d Cir. 2002), a U.S. court of appeals held that [[H. Beatty Chadwick]] could be held indefinitely under federal law, for his failure to produce US$2.5 million as state court ordered in a civil trial. Chadwick had been imprisoned for nine years at that time and continued to be held in prison until 2009, when a state court set him free after 14 years, making his imprisonment the longest on a contempt charge to date.

Civil contempt is only appropriate when the imposed party has the power to comply with the underlying order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=See In re Marciano|url=http://www.protectyou.com/blog/case-law/in-re-marciano/|publisher=Westlaw|location=Donlevy-Rosen &amp; Rosen, P.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Controversial contempt rulings have periodically arisen from cases involving [[asset protection]] trusts, where the court has ordered a settlor of an asset protection trust to repatriate assets so that the assets may be made available to a creditor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Importance of Proper APT Design &amp; Counsel|url=http://protectyou.com/1998/10/the-importance-of-a-property-asset-protection-design/|publisher=The Asset Protection News|author=Howard Rosen|author2=Patricia Donlevy-Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A court cannot maintain an order of contempt where the imposed party does not have the ability to comply with the underlying order. This claim when made by the imposed party is known as the "impossibility defense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Sam|title=In re Marciano - an analysis of the impossibility defense in contempt|url=http://www.protectyou.com/blog/in-re-marciano-an-analysis-of-the-impossibility-defense-in-contempt/|publisher=Donlevy-Rosen &amp; Rosen, P.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contempt of court is considered a [[prerogative]] of the court, and "the requirement of a jury does not apply to 'contempts committed in disobedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name of, or on behalf of, the United States.'" This stance is not universally agreed with by other areas of the legal world, and there have been many calls to have contempt cases to be tried by jury, rather than by judge, as a potential conflict of interest rising from a judge both accusing and sentencing the defendant. At least one Supreme Court Justice has made calls for jury trials to replace judge trials on contempt cases.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1964"&gt;''United States v. Barnett'', {{ussc|376|681|1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Marshals Service is the agency component that first holds all federal prisoners.  It uses the Prisoner Population Management System /Prisoner Tracking System. The only types of records that are disclosed as being in the system are those of "federal prisoners who are in custody pending criminal proceedings."  The records of "alleged civil contempors" are not listed in the Federal Register as being in the system leading to a potential claim for damages under The Privacy Act, {{usc|5|552a(e)(4)(I)}}.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register on November 8, 1999 in Vol. 64, No. 215  
page 60836 a “Revised Notice regarding its Prisoner Tracking System”&lt;/ref&gt;

====News media in the United States====
In the United States, because of the broad protections granted by the [[First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|First Amendment]], with extremely limited exceptions, unless the media outlet is a party to the case, a media outlet cannot be found in contempt of court for reporting about a case because a court cannot order the media in general not to report on a case or forbid it from reporting facts discovered publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart|link=|volume=427|page=539|pin=|year=1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers cannot be closed because of their content.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Near v. Minnesota|link=|volume=283|page=697|pin=|year=1931}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism====
There have been criticisms over the practice of trying contempt from the bench. In particular, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Hugo Black]] wrote in a dissent, "It is high time, in my judgment, to wipe out root and branch the judge-invented and judge-maintained notion that judges can try criminal contempt cases without a jury."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1964"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6252">'''[[Copyright]] law in [[Hong Kong]]''' to a great extent follows the English model. The [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]] of Hong Kong, its constitutional document, guarantees a high degree of autonomy and continuation of laws previously in force after its reunification with [[Mainland China]].  Hong Kong therefore continues to maintain a separate [[intellectual property]] regime from Mainland China. Article 139 and 140 of the Basic Law specifically deal with the protection of copyright in Hong Kong.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Article 139'''

The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall, on its own, formulate policies on science and technology and protect by law achievements in scientific and technological research, patents, discoveries and inventions.

The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall, on its own, decide on the scientific and technological standards and specifications applicable in Hong Kong. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Article 140'''

The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall, on its own, formulate policies on culture and protect by law the achievements and the lawful rights and interests of authors in their literary and artistic creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/text/en/basiclawtext/chapter_6.html|title=Basic Law Full Text - text - chapter (6)|publisher=Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
== Open-qualification system  ==

Apart from general substantive criteria, for Copyright to subsist in a work, the statutory requirements with respect to qualification for copyright protection in s 177 must be met (Copyright Ordinance s 2(3)).

Hong Kong has broad copyright protection thanks to its open-qualification system under Copyright Ordinance ss177(1)(a), 177(1)(b) and 178. It means that no requirements of nationality or other status of the author, or of the work's place of first publication need to be satisfied before a work is eligible for protection. Works transmitted over Internet, radio, televisions are all under protection (ss26 and 177(1)(c)).

Nonetheless, Copyright Ordinance s 180(1) allows the Chief Executive to deny or limit copyright protection for works originating in non-reciprocating jurisdictions.

== Copyright Ordinance ==

The Copyright Ordinance (Cap 528), which became effective on 27 June 1997, is Hong Kong's first purely local copyright law. However, the [[Copyright Act 1956]] of the United Kingdom will continue to apply to the protection of copyright of works created before 27 June 1997.

== Categories of copyright works ==

Copyright Ordinance (Cap 528) s 2(i)(a) protects 9 categories of copyrighted works:

* literary works
* dramatic works
* musical works
* artistic works
* sound recordings
* films
* broadcasts
* cable programmes
* typographical arrangement of published editions

== Criteria of claiming copyright protection ==

In order to successfully claim for copyright protection, 3 criteria must be satisfied: (1) the subject matter must be a 'work'; (2) the work must fall within 1 of the 9 categories stated in s.2(1) of the Hong Kong Copyright Ordinance; and (3) the work must be original if the subject matter is a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work.

== Duration of copyright ==

S.17 to 21 of the Copyright Ordinance deal with the duration of copyright works. The author of the work is deemed to be the person who creates the work (with exceptions for commissioned works and employee works). S.17(1) to (5) states that the duration of copyright of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works is the life of the author plus 50 years, or 50 years from the end of the year in which the work was first created or made available to the public if the identity of the author is not known. 

Except for typographical arrangement of published editions, the duration of copyright in other works is also 50 years from certain events specified in the Copyright Ordinance.

The duration of copyright in typographical arrangement of published editions is 25 years from the year of first publication, according to S.21 of the Copyright Ordinance.

== Moral rights ==

The Hong Kong Copyright Ordinance Pt II Div IV (ss 89-100) recognizes the following two types of [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] ("[[droit d'auteur]]") in favour of the author, director or commissioner of the work regardless of whether he is the owner of the copyright: (i) Right to be identified as author or director (Copyright Ordinance s 89); and (ii) Right to object to derogatory treatment of work Copyright Ordinance s 92.

== Controversies in criminalising the copying of materials ==

Controversial changes criminalising the copying of materials in the course of trade were introduced in 2000: insofar as they affect printed matter, these were quickly suspended following an outcry from educational groups and consumer groups. The suspension, provided in the [[Copyright (Suspension of Amendments) Ordinance 2001]], will expire on 31 July 2004. Hong Kong is currently unique in the [[common law]] world for treating copying infringing materials differently between printed and non-printed materials.

== Administration of copyright laws ==

Copyright laws are administered by the [[Intellectual Property Department]] of the Hong Kong Government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5645">{{European patent law}}
In [[European Union law]], and especially in European [[intellectual property]] law, a '''cross-border injunction''' is an [[injunction]] by a [[court]] in one European country, such as for example a court in the [[Netherlands]] forbidding [[intellectual property infringement|infringement]] in several other European countries.

==Background==
The [[Brussels Regime]] instruments are a set of similar legal instruments, based on which jurisdiction (and recognition) is determined. The instruments are the Brussels I Regulations (44/2001 and 1215/2012), Lugano Conventions (1998, 2007) and the Brussels Convention (1968). The conventions together cover the European Union, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Aruba and all French territories. 

A legal basis for cross-border injunctions may amongst others be found in Article 6(1) (most instruments) or Article 8(1) (EU regulation 1215/2012), providing that "a person domiciled in a Member State to also be sued
* where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled,
* provided the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings".

==Case law==
For a period in the late-1990s, national courts issued cross-border injunctions covering all Brussels regime jurisdictions, but this has been limited by the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ).  

In two cases in July 2006, interpreting Articles 6(1) and 16(4) of the Brussels Convention, the ECJ held that [[European patent]]s are national rights that must be enforced nationally, that it was "unavoidable" that infringements of the same European patent have to be litigated in each relevant national court, even if the lawsuit is against the same group of companies, and that cross-border injunctions are not available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=Rechercher$docrequire=alldocs&amp;numaff=C-4/03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-4/03, ''Gesellschaft für Antriebstechnik  v Lamellen und Kupplungsbau Beteiligungs KG'', (European Ct. of Justice 13 July 2006)]; [http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=Rechercher$docrequire=alldocs&amp;numaff=C-539/03&amp;datefs=&amp;datefe=&amp;nomusuel=&amp;domaine=&amp;mots=&amp;resmax=100 Case C-539/03, ''Roche Nederland BV v Primus'', (European Ct. of Justice 13 July 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the court set forth in grounds 41 of case C-539/03 that "Article 6(1) of the Brussels Convention ... does not apply in European patent infringement proceedings involving a number of companies established in various Contracting States in respect of acts committed in one or more of those States even where those companies, which belong to the same group, may have acted in an identical or similar manner in accordance with a common policy elaborated by one of them". In other words, there will be no close connection between claims as required by Article 6(1) if two closely connected companies domiciled in different Contracting States act (infringe) in the same manner.

Also in 2006, the ECJ decided on case C-04/03 (GAT/LUK). The court ruled that "Article 16(4) of the Convention … is to be interpreted as meaning that the rule of exclusive jurisdiction laid down therein concerns all proceedings relating to the registration or validity of a patent, irrespective of whether the issue is raised by way of an action or a plea in objection". As of 2015, Article 16(4) of the Convention corresponds to Article 24(4) of EU regulation 1215/2012. The ruling in case C-04/03 confirms that the courts of each Contracting State have exclusive jurisdiction on validity of patents registered for the territory of that State. Exclusive jurisdiction under Article 22(4) applies irrespective of whether a patent proprietor is sued for revocation or whether an alleged infringer asserts invalidity in inter partes proceedings.

In 2012, nearly six years after its rulings on cases C-04/03 and C-539/03, the ECJ decided on case C-616/10 (Solvay/Honeywell).&lt;ref&gt;[http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?docid=124996&amp;doclang=EN ''Solvay SA v Honeywell Fluorine Products Europe BV, Honeywell Belgium NV, Honeywell Europe NV'', (European Ct. of Justice 12 July 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that "Article 22(4) of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as not precluding, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, the application of Article 31 of that regulation". Since Article 31 is about provisional measures, a court may issue a cross-border injunction where an action aims for such measures. The ruling on case C-539/03 allows for a court to issue cross-border injunctions as provisional measures where companies domiciled in different Contracting States infringe in the same Contracting State.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8107">Integration is a political and economic agreement among countries that gives preference to member countries to the agreement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; General integration can be achieved in three different approachable ways: through the  [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), bilateral integration, and [[regional integration]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Daniels, John D., Lee H. Radebaugh, and Daniel P Sullivan. International Business: Environment and Operations. NJ: Prentice Hall, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In bilateral integration, only two countries economically cooperate with one another, whereas in regional integration, several countries within the same geographic distance become joint to form organizations such as the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). Indeed, factors of mobility like capital, technology and labour are indicating strategies for cross-national integration along with those mentioned above.

==The World Trade Organization==

The WTO is one of the most effective trade agreements among nations. The WTO replaced the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in 1995 and has 125 member nations.currently 153 member are part of WTO. Many believe GATT initiated rampant liberalization in trade in 1947 and its move contributed to the expansion of trade all over the world by eliminating tariff and quotas. Moreover, WTO continued GATT's principle with more multilateral forum, which enables governments to settle agreements or to dispute them regarding trade.
 
Rapid growth of trade among nations has forced the agreement to be acknowledged as a fundamental basis for the member nations to follow certain rules and regulations as the signatories of the agreement. As a result, WTO expanded its mission to include trade in services, investments, intellectual property, sanitary measures, plant health, agriculture, and textiles, as well as technical baariers to trade.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"&gt;Daniels, J., Radebaugh, L., Sullivan, D. (2007). International Business: environment and operations, 11th edition. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-186942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The European Union (EU)==

The largest and most comprehensive regional economic group is the [[European Union|EU]]. It began as a [[free trade agreement]] with the goal to become a customs union and to integrate in other ways. The formation of the [[European Parliament]] and the establishment of a [[Euro]] the common currency make EU the most ambitious in comparison to other regional trade groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It progressed from being the European Economic Community (EEC) to the [[European Community]] (EC) to finally the European Union. Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland who decided not to leave [[European Free Trade Area]] are linked together with the EU as a customs union.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt; The EU comprises 28 countries, including 12 countries from mostly Central and Eastern Europe that joined since 2004. The EU abolished trade barriers on intra-zonal trade, instituted a [[common external tariff]], created a common currency, the euro.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt;

The implications of the EU for corporate strategy are: 
* Companies need to determine where to produce products.
* Companies need to determine what their entry strategy will be.
* Companies need to balance the commonness of the EU with national differences.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt;

==North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)==

[[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] is designed to eliminate [[tariff]] barriers and liberalize investment opportunities and trade in services. NAFTA includes [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United States]], where went into effect in 1994. The United States and Canada historically have had various forms of mutual economic cooperation. They signed the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] effective January 1, 1989, which eliminated all tariffs on bilateral trade by January 1, 1998. In February 1991, Mexico approached the United States to establish a free trade agreement. The formal negotiations that began in June 1991 included Canada. The resulting North American Free Trade Agreement became effective on January 1, 1994.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt;

The main provisions in NAFTA are:

* the harmonization of trade rules,
* the liberalization of restrictions on services and foreign investment,
* the enforcement of intellectual property rights,
* a dispute settlement process,
* regional labour laws and standards, and
* strengthened environmental standards.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt;

==Regional economic integration in the Americas==

There are six major regional economic groups in the Americas and they can be further divided into [[Central America]] and [[South America]]. The major reason for these different groups in Central and South America entering into collaboration was market size.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt; The [[Caribbean Community and Common Market]] (CARICOM) and the [[Central American Common Market]] (CACM) are both found in [[Central America]].  The two major blocs in [[South America]] are the [[Andean Community]] (CAN) and the [[Southern Common Market]] (MERCOSUR) which is the major trade group. MERCOSUR comprises Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. It generates 75 percent of South America’s GDP and this makes MERCOSUR the fourth largest trading bloc in the world after the EU, NAFTA, and the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN).&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt; 

Since August 23, 2008, there exists another integration initiative, the [[Union of South American Nations]] (''UNASUR''). It includes all independent states of South America with about 400 Million people and intends to create a level of integration similar to the European Union by 2025.

==Regional economic integration in Asia==

Regional economic integration has not been as successful in [[Asia]] as in the EU or NAFTA because most Asian countries have relied on U.S. and European markets for their exports.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt; The [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), formed in 1967, consisted of the following countries: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The [[ASEAN Free Trade Area]] (AFTA), formed officially in 1993, was for the purpose of cutting tariffs on inter-regional trade to a maximum of 5% by 2008.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt;  ASEAN is the third largest free trade agreement in the world after the EU and NAFTA and above MERCOSUR. The [[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC), founded in 1989, was to promote multilateral economic cooperation in trade and investment in the Pacific Rim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apecsec.org.sg/apec/about_apec.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204105426/http://www.apecsec.org.sg./apec/about_apec.html |archivedate=2008-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; APEC is composed of 21 countries that border the Pacific Rim; progress toward free trade is hampered by size and geographic distance between member countries and the lack of a treaty.

==Regional economic integration in Africa==

There are several regional trade groups in [[Africa]] that are registered with the WTO, including:
* the [[Southern Africa Development Community]] (SADC)
* the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA)
* the [[Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa]]
* the [[West African Economic and Monetary Union]] (WAEMU)&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt;

Created in 2002 by 53 African nations, the [[African Union]] took the place of the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU). The OAU was established in 1963 and focuses its energy and resources on political issues in Africa (notably colonialism and racism) and the pursuit of market liberalization and economic growth in Africa.&lt;ref name="Daniels, J. 2007"/&gt;

'''''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.''''', 509 U.S. 579 (1993), is a [[United States Supreme Court]] case determining the standard for admitting [[expert testimony]] in [[United States district court|federal courts]].  The ''Daubert'' Court held that the enactment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] implicitly overturned the [[Frye standard]]; the standard that the Court articulated is referred to as the [[Daubert standard]].

==Facts==
Jason Daubert and Eric Schuller had been born with serious birth defects.  They and their parents sued [[Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]] Inc., a subsidiary of [[Dow Chemical Company]], in a California District Court, claiming that the drug [[Bendectin]] had caused the birth defects.  Merrell Dow removed the case to federal court, and then moved for [[summary judgment]] because their expert submitted documents showing that no published scientific study demonstrated a link between Bendectin and birth defects.  Daubert and Schuller submitted expert evidence of their own that suggested that Bendectin could cause birth defects.  Daubert and Schuller's evidence, however, was based on ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' animal studies, pharmacological studies, and reanalysis of other published studies, and these methodologies had not yet gained acceptance within the general scientific community.

The district court granted summary judgment for Merrell Dow, and Daubert and Schuller appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]].  The Ninth Circuit found the district court correctly granted summary judgment because the plaintiffs' proffered evidence had not yet been accepted as a reliable technique by scientists who had had an opportunity to scrutinize and verify the methods used by those scientists.  Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit was skeptical of the fact that the plaintiffs' evidence appeared to be generated in preparation for litigation.  Without their proffered evidence, the Ninth Circuit doubted that the plaintiffs could prove at a trial that the Bendectin had, in fact, caused the birth defects about which they were complaining.

==Majority opinion==

===Prior law===

In a 1923 case, ''[[Frye v. United States]]'', 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit]] held that evidence could be admitted in court only if "the thing from which the deduction is made" is "sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs." ''Frye'' dealt with a [[systolic blood pressure]] deception test, a "crude precursor" to the [[polygraph]].  In 1923, this blood pressure test was not widely accepted among scientists, and so the ''Frye'' court ruled it could not be used in court. Over the years, scholars disputed the proper scope and application of the ''Frye'' test.

The plaintiffs successfully argued that after Congress adopted the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] in 1975, ''Frye'' was no longer the governing standard for admitting scientific evidence in trials held in federal court. The Supreme Court agreed and had already ruled that where common law rules conflicted with provisions of the Rules, the enactment of the Rules had the effect of supplanting the common law. ''Frye'' was certainly part of the federal common law of evidence because it was decided almost 50 years before the Rules were enacted. But the text of the Rules did not suggest that Congress intended to keep the ''Frye'' rule, and so the Court reasoned that ''Frye'' was no longer the rule.

Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides (in part):

&lt;blockquote&gt;If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The text of Rule 702 did not make admissibility of expert testimony depend on general acceptance, and there was no evidence that Congress intended to incorporate a general acceptance standard into Rule 702. "Given the Rules' permissive backdrop and their inclusion of a specific rule on expert testimony that does not mention 'general acceptance,' the assertion that the Rules somehow assimilated ''Frye'' is unconvincing. ''Frye'' made 'general acceptance' the exclusive test for admitting expert testimony. That austere standard, absent from, and incompatible with, the Federal Rules of Evidence, should not be applied in federal trials."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|link=|volume=509|page=579|pin=589|year=1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The standard governing expert testimony===

Three key provisions of the Rules governed admission of expert testimony in court. First, ''scientific knowledge'', meaning that the testimony must be scientific in nature and must be grounded in "knowledge." Of course, science does not claim to know anything with absolute certainty; science "represents a ''process'' for proposing and refining theoretical explanations about the world that are subject to further testing and refinement." The "scientific knowledge" contemplated by Rule 702 had to be arrived at by the scientific method.

Second, the scientific knowledge must ''assist the trier of fact'' in understanding the evidence or determining a fact in issue in the case. The trier of fact is often either a jury or a judge; but other fact finders may exist within the contemplation of the federal rules of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''See, in pertinent part,'' Federal Rule of Evidence 101 (Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Dec. 1, 1993); Federal Rule of Evidence 1101 &amp; annotations thereto (Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Dec. 1, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; To be helpful to the trier of fact, there must be a "valid scientific connection to the pertinent inquiry as a prerequisite to admissibility." For example, although it is within the purview of scientific knowledge, knowing whether the moon was full on a given night does not typically assist the trier of fact in knowing whether a person was sane when he or she committed a given act.

Third, the Rules expressly provided that the judge would make the threshold determination&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Federal Rule of Evidence 104(a) (Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Dec. 1, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; regarding whether certain scientific knowledge would indeed assist the trier of fact in the manner contemplated by Rule 702. "This entails a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue." This preliminary assessment can turn on whether something has been tested, whether an idea has been subjected to scientific peer review or published in scientific journals, the rate of error involved in the technique, and even general acceptance, among other things. It focuses on methodology and principles, not the ultimate conclusions generated.

The Court stressed that the new standard under Rule 702 was rooted in the judicial process and intended to be distinct and separate from the search for scientific truth. "Scientific conclusions are subject to perpetual revision. Law, on the other hand, must resolve disputes finally and quickly. The scientific project is advanced by broad and wide-ranging consideration of a multitude of hypotheses, for those that are incorrect will eventually be shown to be so, and that in itself is an advance." Rule 702 was intended to resolve legal disputes and, thus, had to be interpreted in conjunction with other rules of evidence and with other legal means of ending those disputes.

Cross examination within the adversary process is adequate to help legal decision makers arrive at efficient ends to disputes. "We recognize that, in practice, a gatekeeping role for the judge, no matter how flexible, inevitably on occasion will prevent the jury from learning of authentic insights and innovations. That, nevertheless, is the balance that is struck by Rules of Evidence designed not for the exhaustive search for cosmic understanding but for the particularized resolution of legal disputes."

==Aftermath==
{{main|Daubert standard}}
After Daubert, it was expected that the range of scientific opinion evidence used in court would be expanded.  However, courts have strictly applied the standards in Daubert, and it has generally been successful in excluding "[[junk science]]" or "[[pseudoscience]]", as well as new or experimental techniques and research that the decision might have been expected to deem admissible.

Discerning between [[science]] and "[[pseudoscience]]" was the theme of a book by [[Karl Popper]] whose summary was quoted in Daubert: "the criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its [[falsifiability]], or refutability, or testability." The book, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (5th ed. 1989), pp.&amp;nbsp;34–57, explains how psychology is more like astrology than astronomy because it does not make predictions about an individual which are falsifiable. He wrote that "the impressive thing about" Einstein's predictions "is the risk involved...If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted." But "it was impossible to describe a human behaviour" which would be accepted as proving psychology false.

The considerations in Daubert do not all have to be met for the evidence to be admitted.  It is necessary only that the majority of the tests be substantially complied with.

The principle in Daubert was expanded in ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', where the evidence in question was from a technician and not a scientist.  The technician was going to testify that the only possible cause of a tire blowout must have been a manufacturing defect, as he could not determine any other possible cause.  The Court of Appeal had admitted the evidence on the assumption that Daubert did not apply to technical evidence, only scientific evidence.  The Supreme Court reversed, saying that the standard in Daubert could apply to merely technical evidence, but that in this case, the evidence of the proposed expert did not meet the standard.

==Pronunciation of ''Daubert''==
While not a matter of law, discussions, corrections, and recriminations on this point from time to time vex attorneys and others among whom the subject of this case arises. Michael H. Gottesman, Jason Daubert's attorney reports that Daubert and his family do not affect the French pronunciation, which would be sounded similar to "dough-bear" {{IPAc-en|d|oʊ|ˈ|b|ɛər}}. Rather, they pronounce their family name in the same manner as ''Dow-Burt''{{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|b|ər|t}}.&lt;ref&gt;Gottesman, Michael. [http://homepages.law.asu.edu/~kayed/pubs/se/sine/07/gottesman94.htm "Admissibility of Expert Testimony After Daubert: The "Prestige" Factor"], ''43 Emory L.J. 867, 867 (1994)''. Retrieved on 2009-01-13&lt;/ref&gt; The popular use of the French pronunciation may have arisen from Gottesman refraining from correcting the justices during oral argument before the Supreme Court.

The brown outer facade can be seen being assembled to the inner white facade via struts. These struts create a walkway between both 'skins' for ventilation, solar shading and maintenance.]]
The '''double-skin facade''' is a system of building consisting of two skins, or [[facade]]s, placed in such a way that air flows in the intermediate cavity. The ventilation of the cavity can be natural, fan supported or mechanical. Apart from the type of the ventilation inside the cavity, the origin and destination of the air can differ depending mostly on climatic conditions, the use, the location, the occupational hours of the building and the HVAC strategy.

The glass skins can be single or double glazing units with a distance from 20&amp;nbsp;cm up to 2 metres. Often, for protection and heat extraction reasons during the cooling period, solar shading devices are placed inside the cavity.

==History==
The essential concept of the double-skin facade was first explored and tested by the Swiss-French architect [[Le Corbusier]] in the early 20th century. His idea, which he called ''mur neutralisant'' (neutralizing wall), involved the insertion of heating/cooling pipes between large
layers of glass. Such a system was employed in his [[Villa Schwob]] ([[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], [[Switzerland]], 1916), and proposed for several other projects, including the League of Nations competition (1927), [[Tsentrosoyuz|Centrosoyuz building]] (Moscow, 1928–33), and [[Cité du Refuge]] ([[Paris]], 1930). American engineers studying the system in 1930 informed Le Corbusier that it would use much more energy than a conventional air system, but Harvey Bryan later concluded Le Corbusier's idea had merit if it included solar heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

Another early experiment was the 1937 [[Alfred Lee Loomis|Alfred Loomis]] house by architect [[William Lescaze]] in Tuxedo Park, NY. This house included "an elaborate double envelope" with a 2-foot-deep air space conditioned by a separate system from the house itself.  The object was to maintain high humidity levels inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The recent resurgence of efficient building design has renewed interest in this concept.  Since the [[USGBC]] rewards points for reduction in energy consumption vs. a base case, this strategy has been used to optimize energy performance of buildings.

==Examples==
[[File:Shapes and reflections, 30 St Mary Axe - geograph.org.uk - 1391286.jpg|thumb|250px|[[The Gherkin]] in London. Windows open on the outer skin to allow air to enter the cavity between the inner and outer skin.]]
[[File:Co-op Building construction 7 Dec 2011.jpg|thumb|250px|[[One Angel Square]] in Manchester. The use of a double skin is evident in construction.]]
Examples of notable buildings which utilise a double-skin facade are [[30 St Mary Axe]] (also known as ''The Gherkin'') and [[1 Angel Square]]. Both of these buildings achieve great environmental credentials for their size, with the benefits of a double skin key to this. The Gherkin features triangular windows on the outer skin which skelter up the skyscraper. These windows open according to weather and building data, allowing more or less air to cross flow through the building for ventilation.

==Technical Details==
The cavity between the two skins may be either naturally or mechanically ventilated.  In cool climates the solar gain within the cavity may be circulated to the occupied space to offset heating requirements, while in hot climates the cavity may be vented out of the building to mitigate [[solar gain]] and decrease the cooling load.  In each case the assumption is that a higher insulative value may be achieved by using this glazing configuration versus a conventional glazing configuration.

Recent studies showed that the energy performance of a building connected to a double-skin facade can be improved both in the cold and the warm season or in cold and warm climates by optimizing the ventilation strategy of the facade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Criticisms==
The advantages of double-skin facades over conventional single skin facades are not clear-cut; similar insulative values may be obtained using conventional high performance, low-e windows.  The cavity results in a decrease in usable floor space, and depending on the strategy for ventilating the cavity, it may have problems with condensation, becoming soiled or introducing outside noise. The construction of a second skin may also present a significant increase in materials and design costs.

Building energy modelling of double-skin facades is inherently more difficult because of varying [[heat transfer]] properties within the cavity, making the modeling of energy performance and the prediction of savings debatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashrae.org/doclib/20071009_emergingtechnologies.pdf |title=Home |publisher=ashrae.org |accessdate=2012-12-27 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews of the literature==
A literature review on double-skin facades was written by Harris Poirazis in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebd.lth.se/fileadmin/energi_byggnadsdesign/images/Publikationer/Bok-EBD-R3-G5_alt_2_Harris.pdf ebd.lth.se]&lt;/ref&gt; The main aim of the report is to describe the concept of double-skin facades based on different sources of literature. The literature survey covers a brief description of the concept, history and common double-skin facade types and classifications. A technical description including construction parameters, (facade) opening principles and choice of panes and shading devices is also given. The possibilities and limitations of the system are described and the advantages and disadvantages are presented. Daylight simulations control strategies are also discussed. Finally, roughly 50 case studies are briefly described.

In order to serve as a literature report for the SHC IEA Task 34/ECBCS Annex 43 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea-shc.org/task34/subtask/index.html iea-shc.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213045144/http://www.iea-shc.org/task34/subtask/index.html |date=December 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an extensive description of modeling approaches and methods for DSF was added in the existing literature review report (in 2006), covering modeling issues including airflow and thermal simulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea-ebc.org/projects/completed-projects/ebc-annex-43/ iea-ebc.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In his PhD thesis, an analysis of different double-skin facade types is carried out and conclusions are drawn for integration in Nordic climatic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebd.lth.se/fileadmin/energi_byggnadsdesign/images/Publikationer/Bok_Dokt_avhandling_HP_G5.pdf#search='shc' ebd.lth.se]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedman's Inc.''' was a US company that owned and operated fine jewelry specialty stores under the names '''Friedman's Jewelers''' and '''Crescent Jewelers'''. The company declared bankruptcy in 2008 and had shuttered all stores by June 2008.

==History==
The company was established in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in 1920. Friedman's Inc. was headquartered in [[Addison, Texas]]. They were the third largest jewelry company in the US. Friedman's stressed value and low prices, owning the trademark "The Value Leader" and advertising "Unbeatable Values". Unlike many chain jewelers, Friedman's had many of its locations in [[Power center (retail)|power center]]s and [[strip mall]]s, besides enclosed malls and [[outlet center]]s. The company had stated that they preferred locations anchored by a discounter "big box" store, almost always [[Wal-Mart]]. This fits with their core demographic of lower to middle income customers between 18 and 40.

Due to a bankruptcy filing in early 2008, Friedman's and Crescent liquidated all of their stores save for a small number of locations purchased by [[Whitehall Jewelers]] Inc. for approximately 14 million dollars. Whitehall went bankrupt shortly after the purchase and began liquidating all of its stores in August 2008.

In 2009, Windsor Fine Jewelers, LLC based in Augusta, GA, purchased the trademark "Friedman's Jewelers" and opened a location in Augusta, GA. In 2017, they launched the www.friedmans.com e-commerce platform.

Following the financial crisis of 2007-08, legislators unsuccessfully tried to reinstate Glass–Steagall Sections 20 and 32 as part of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]].  Currently, bills are pending in [[United States Congress]] that would revise banking law regulation based on Glass–Steagall inspired principles.   Both in the United States and elsewhere banking reforms have been proposed that also refer to Glass–Steagall principles.  These proposals raise issues that were addressed during the long Glass–Steagall  debate in the United States, including issues of "ring fencing" commercial banking operations and "narrow banking" proposals that would sharply reduce the permitted activities of commercial banks.

Please see the main article, [[Glass–Steagall in post-financial crisis reform debate]], for information about the following topics:
* Failed 2009-10 efforts to restore Glass–Steagall Sections 20 and 32 as part of Dodd–Frank
* Post-2010 efforts to enact Glass–Steagall inspired financial reform legislation
* Volcker Rule ban on proprietary trading as Glass–Steagall lite 
* Further financial reform proposals that refer to Glass–Steagall
**UK and EU "ring fencing" proposals
***Similar issues debated in connection with Glass–Steagall and "firewalls"
**Limited purpose banking and narrow banking
***Wholesale financial institutions in Glass–Steagall reform debate
**Glass–Steagall references in reform proposal debate
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;

This article is about efforts in the United States to reinstate repealed sections of the [[Glass–Steagall Act]] following the [[financial crisis of 2007-08]]; and the adoption or proposal of similar financial reforms in the United States and elsewhere.

==Efforts to restore Sections 20 and 32 as part of Dodd–Frank==
During the 2009 [[United States House of Representatives]] consideration of H.R. 4173, the bill that became the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010]], Representative [[Maurice Hinchey]] (D-NY) proposed an amendment to the bill that would have reenacted Glass–Steagall Sections 20 and 32, which had been repealed by the 1999 [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLBA), and also prohibited bank insurance activities. The amendment was not voted on by the House.&lt;ref name="Nation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/mccain-gets-it-obama-doesnt|title=McCain Gets It, Obama Doesn't|author=Robert Scheer|publisher=The Nation|date=2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2009, Senators [[John McCain]] (R-AZ) and [[Maria Cantwell]] (D-WA) introduced in the [[United States Senate]] the "Banking Integrity Act of 2009" (S.2886), which would have reinstated Glass–Steagall Sections 20 and 32, but was not voted on by the Senate.&lt;ref name="Nation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN02886:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp;|title=Bill Summary &amp; Status, 111th Congress (2009-2010), S. 2866, CRS Summary| publisher=[[THOMAS]] Library of Congress|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Senate acted on its version of what became the [[Dodd–Frank Act]], the [[Congressional Research Service]] issued a report describing securities activities banks and their affiliates had conducted before the GLBA. The Report stated Glass–Steagall had "imperfectly separated, to a certain degree" commercial and investment banking and described the extensive securities activities the Federal Reserve Board had authorized for "Section 20 affiliates" since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CRS|2010a|pp=1 and 13–15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, 2011, Representative [[Marcy Kaptur]] (D-OH) introduced in the House the "Return to Prudent Banking Act of 2011" (H.R. 129), which would have (1) amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to add prohibitions on FDIC insured bank affiliations instead of reenacting the affiliation restrictions in Glass–Steagall Sections 20 and 32, (2) directed federal banking regulators and courts to interpret these affiliation provisions and Glass–Steagall Sections 16 and 21 in accordance with the Supreme Court decision in ''Investment Company Institute v. Camp'',&lt;ref name="Camp" /&gt; and (3) repealed various GLBA changes to the [[Bank Holding Company Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Cook| first=Merrill | title=Support the Kaptur/Jones Prudent Banking Act of 2011, H.R. 1489 | newspaper =[[Standard Examiner]]|location=Ogden, Utah| date=July 20, 2011 | page=2|url=http://www.standard.net/stories/2011/07/20/support-kapturjones-prudent-banking-act-2011-hr-1489|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}.  {{Citation|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1489:|title=Bill Text, 112th Congress (2011-2012), H.R. 1489.IH| publisher=[[THOMAS]] Library of Congress|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was reported to a House subcommittees but not further acted upon before the 112th Congress adjourned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR01489:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp;|title=Bill Summary &amp; Status, 112th Congress (2011-2012), H.R. 1489, CRS Summary| publisher=[[THOMAS]] Library of Congress|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

# separate traditional banks that offer savings and checking accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from riskier financial services like investment banking, swaps dealings, hedge funds and private equity activities, as well as from structured and synthetic products, and other products, that did not exist when Glass–Steagall was originally passed.
# define the "business of banking" to prevent national banks from engaging in risky activities and bars non-banking activities from being treated as "closely related" to banking. These restriction would counter regulatory loopholes for risky activities, because the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] and the Federal Reserve used these terms to allow traditional banks and bank-holding companies to engage in high-risk activities.
# address the issue of [[too big to fail]]: by separating depositary institutions from riskier activities, large financial institutions will shrink in size, become smaller and safer and won't be able to rely on federal depository insurance as a safety net for their risky activities. Although some financial institutions may still be large, the implicit government guarantee of a bailout will be reduced because such institutions would no longer be intertwined with depository institutions.

==Volcker rule as "Glass–Steagall lite"==
The Dodd–Frank Act included the [[Volcker Rule]], which among other things limited proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman and Cutler LLP 2010.  Whitehead 2011, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; This proprietary trading ban will generally prevent commercial banks and their affiliates from acquiring non-governmental securities with the intention of selling those securities for a profit in the "near term."&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead 2011, p. 48.  Chapman and Cutler LLP 2010, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have described the Volcker Rule, particularly its proprietary trading ban,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/10/12/volcker-rule-made-simple-banks-cant-gamble-with-our-money/| title =Volcker Rule Made Simple: Banks Can't Gamble With Our Money (Probably)| last=Watson| first=Bruce| date=October 12, 2011| publisher=Daily Finance| accessdate=February 20, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as "Glass–Steagall lite."&lt;ref name="VR"&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.economist.com/node/15374543| title =Glass–Steagall lite| date=January 22, 2010| publisher=[[The Economist]]| accessdate=February 20, 2012}}.  {{Citation| url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate-uk/2010/01/25/Glass–Steagall-lite-brewed-by-volcker-served-by-obama/ | title=Glass–Steagall Lite, brewed by Volcker, served by Obama| last=Copeland| first=Laurence| date=January 25, 2010| publisher=Reuters|work=The Great Debate UK| accessdate=February 20, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in [[Glass–Steagall: legislation, limits and loopholes#Prohibitions apply to dealing in and underwriting or distributing securities|prohibitions apply to dealing in and underwriting or distributing securities]], Glass–Steagall restricted commercial bank "dealing" in, not "trading" of, non-government securities the bank was permitted to purchase as "investment securities."&lt;ref name="proptrade" /&gt; After the GLBA became law, Glass–Steagall Section 16 continued to restrict bank securities purchases. The GLBA, however, expanded the list of "bank-eligible" securities to permit banks to buy, underwrite, and deal in municipal revenue bonds, not only "full faith and credit" government bonds.&lt;ref name="muni" /&gt;

The Volcker Rule permits "market making" and other "dealer" activities in non-government securities as services for customers.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead 2011, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Glass–Steagall Section 16 prohibits banks from being a "market maker" or otherwise "dealing" in non-government (i.e., "bank-ineligible") securities.&lt;ref name="dealer" /&gt; Glass–Steagall Section 16 permits a bank to purchase and sell (i.e., permits "trading") for a bank's own account non-government securities that the OCC approves as "investment securities."&lt;ref name="proptrade" /&gt; The Volcker Rule will prohibit such "proprietary trading" of non-government securities.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead 2011, pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and after the late-2000s financial crisis, banking regulators worried that banks were incorrectly reporting non-traded assets as held in their "trading account" because of lower regulatory capital requirements for assets held in a "trading account."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.dmrra.com/publications/Risk%20Magazine/200603%20Regulatory%20Arbitrage%20-%20Back%20to%20Basics.pdf| title=Regulatory arbitrage:  back to basics| last=Rowe| first=David| date=March 2006| publisher=[[Risk (magazine)|Risk Magazine]]|page=66| accessdate=February 20, 2012}}.  {{Citation| url=http://www.amttraining.com/technical-updates/regulatory-capital-for-banks-trading-activities-set-to-increase-to-eliminate-regulatory-arbitrage-between-trading-book-and-banking-book---january-2009.html| title=Regulatory capital for banks' trading activities set to increase to eliminate regulatory arbitrage between trading book and banking book| last=Caresana| first=Annalisa| date=January 2009| publisher=Adkins Matchett &amp; Toy|series=Technical Update|accessdate=February 20, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Volcker Rule, U.S. banking regulators have proposed that banks and their affiliates be prohibited from holding any asset (other than government securities and other listed exceptions) as a "trading position."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Norris| first=Floyd | author-link=Floyd Norris| title=Bank Rules That Serve Two Masters | newspaper =[[New York Times]]| date =October 14, 2011|page=B1 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/business/new-dodd-frank-rules-muddled-by-congress-that-wants-it-both-ways.html?hp | accessdate=February 20, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Senators [[Jeff Merkley]] (D-OR) and [[Carl Levin]] (D-MI) have written that "proprietary trading losses" played "a central role in bringing the financial system to its knees." They wrote that the Volcker Rule's proprietary trading ban contained in statutory language they proposed is a "modern Glass–Steagall" because Glass–Steagall was both "over-inclusive" (in prohibiting some "truly client-oriented activities that could be managed by developments in securities and banking law") and "under-inclusive" in failing to cover derivatives trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last1=Merkley| first1=Jeff| last2=Levin| first2=Carl| year=2011| title=The Dodd–Frank Act Restrictions on Proprietary Trading and Conflicts of Interest: New Tools to Address Evolving Threats| journal=Harvard Journal of Legislation| volume=48| issue=2| pages=530 and 538–539|url=http://www.harvardjol.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Merkley-Levin_Policy-Essay.pdf|accessdate=February 25, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Arthur Wilmarth wrote that from 1990-1997 the nine U.S. banks with the greatest securities activities held more than 20% of their assets as trading assets.&lt;ref name="Wilmarth 2002, p. 374"/&gt; By 1997, 40% of J.P. Morgan's revenue was from trading.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmarth 2002, p. 374, fn. 665.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1995 study by the federal banking regulators of commercial bank trading activity from June 30, 1984, to June 30, 1994, concluded that "trading activities are an increasingly important source of revenue for banks" and that "[n]otwithstanding the numerous press reports that focus on negative events, the major commercial banks have experienced long-term success in serving customers and generating revenues with these activities." In reporting the study results, the [[American Banker]] described "proprietary trading" as "basically securities trading not connected to customer-related bank activities" and summarized the study as finding that "proprietary trading has been getting a bad rap."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last =de Senerpont Domas| first =Olaf | title=Bank Trading Losses Minimal and Risks Limited, U.S. Says | newspaper =[[American Banker]]| page=24| date=December 7, 1995}}.

Paul Volcker supported the Volcker Rule prohibition on proprietary trading as part of bringing commercial banks back to "concentrating on continuing customer interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Dixon|first1=Kim|last2=Witkowski|first2=Karey| title=Volcker: Proprietary trading not central to crisis| date=March 30, 2010| publisher =[[Reuters]]|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/03/30/us-financial-regulation-volcker-idUSTRE62T56420100330 |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}.  {{Citation| last=Volcker| first=Paul | title=Essential Elements of Financial Reform|work=Transcript of speech delivered at the [[Peterson Institute]]|date=March 30, 2010|url=http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/paper.cfm?ResearchID=1535|accessdate=February 19, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As described in the article [[Decline of the Glass–Steagall Act]], Volcker had long testified to Congress in support of repealing Glass–Steagall Sections 20 and 32.&lt;ref name="Volcker1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Volcker1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Volcker1990s" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Volcker|first=Paul|title=Boost for Banking|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=September 10, 1998|page=A21 ( [[Op-Ed]])}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 he explained that he understood Glass–Steagall as preventing banks from being principally engaged in underwriting and dealing in corporate securities. Volcker stated that with securitization and other developments he believes it is a proper bank function to underwrite corporate securities "as serving a legitimate customer need." He, therefore, did not believe "repeal of Glass–Steagall was terrible" but that Congress "should have thought about what they replace it with." Volcker's criticism was that Congress "didn't replace it with other restrictions."&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/pro_apr_10.pdf | title=Conference Proceedings, 19th Annual Hyman P.

Separate from its proprietary trading ban, the Volcker Rule restricts bank and affiliate sponsorship and ownership of [[hedge fund]]s and [[private equity fund]]s.&lt;ref name="VR" /&gt; The GLBA amended the Bank Holding Company Act to permit "merchant banking" investments by bank affiliates subject to various restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CRS|2010b|pp=5–7}}.

Fein 2011, § 8.03[D], p. 8-12.&lt;/ref&gt; This was not a Glass–Steagall change but a change to the Bank Holding Company Act, which previously limited the size of investments bank affiliates could make in a company engaged in activities not "closely related to banking."&lt;ref&gt;Lockner and Hansche 2000, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Such merchant banking investments may be made through private equity funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CRS|2010b|pp=6–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Volcker Rule will affect the ability of bank affiliates to make such investments.&lt;ref&gt;Fein 2011, § 7.08[G], pp. 7-119 to 7-126 and § 8.04, p. 8-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Debate on "firewalls"====
Congressional and bank regulator efforts to "repeal", "reform" or apply Glass–Steagall were based on isolating a commercial banking firm's expanded securities activities in a separately capitalized bank affiliate.&lt;ref name="firewalls1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="firewalls1997" /&gt; Much of the debate concerned whether such affiliates could be owned by a bank (as with "operating subsidiaries" in the 1990s) or would be bank holding company subsidiaries outside the chain of bank ownership.&lt;ref name="HCsub" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 2000, pp. 335-337 and 382-424.  Fein 2011, §1.04[B] pp. 1-21 to 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, "firewalls" were intended to isolate the bank from the affiliate.&lt;ref&gt;Shull and White 1998, pp. 1, 8-10, and 14-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Banking regulators and commentators debated whether "firewalls" could truly separate a bank from its affiliate in a crisis and often cited the early 1980s' statement by then [[Citicorp]] [[CEO]] [[Walter Wriston]] that "it is inconceivable that any major bank would walk away from any subsidiary of its holding company."&lt;ref&gt;Shull and White 1998, p. 8.  {{citation |title=Governing Banking's Future: Markets vs. Regulation |last=England |first=Catherine |year=1991 |publisher=Kluwer Academic |location=Boston | page=65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zhd-sOsv_d4C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=wriston+inconceivable+any+major+bank+walk+away+from+subsidiary#v=onepage&amp;q=wriston%20inconceivable%20any%20major%20bank%20walk%20away%20from%20subsidiary&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}.

Fein 2011, §1.04[B] p.1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Both testified that in a crisis the owners of the overall firm would inevitably find ways to use the assets of any solvent part of the firm to assist the troubled part.&lt;ref name="firewallsVG" /&gt; Thus, "firewalls" sufficient to prevent a bank from assisting its affiliate would eliminate the purpose of the combination, but "workable" firewalls would be insufficient to prevent such assistance. Both Volcker and Greenspan proposed that the solution was adequate supervision, including sufficient capital and other requirements.&lt;ref name="firewallsVG" /&gt;

In 1998 and 1999 Greenspan testified to Congress in opposition to the Clinton Administration proposal to permit national bank subsidiaries to engage in expanded securities and other activities. He argued such direct bank subsidiary activities would be "financed by the sovereign credit of the United States" through the "federal safety net" for banks, despite the Treasury Department's assurance that "firewalls" between the bank and its operating subsidiary would prevent the expansion of the "federal safety net."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last =Wells| first=Rob | title=Fed Chief Discourages New Bank Powers, Says Pending Bill Would Give Unfair Advantage | newspaper =[[Bloomberg News]]|date =April 29, 1999}}.  {{Citation| title=Testimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, June 17, 1998, "H.R. 10, the Financial Services Act of 1998" | publisher=Federal Reserve Board|date=June 17, 1998| pages=10–13 ("Operating Subsidiaries vs. Holding Companies")|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/testimony/1998/19980617.htm|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}.  {{Citation| title=Testimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan, before the Subcommittee on Finance and Hazardous Materials, Committee on Commerce, U.S. House of Representatives, "H.R. 10 and financial modernization" |publisher=Federal Reserve Board| date=April 28, 1999| pages=1–6 ("Operating Subsidiaries")|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/testimony/1999/19990428.htm|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in [[The aftermath of the repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act#Commentator response to Section 20 and 32 repeal|commentator response to Section 20 and 32 repeal]], Gary Stern, Arthur Wilmarth, and others questioned whether either operating subsidiaries or separate holding company affiliates could be isolated from an affiliated bank in a financial crisis and feared that the "[[too big to fail]]" doctrine gave competitive benefits to banking firms entering the securities or insurance business through either structure.&lt;ref name="TBTF" /&gt; Greenspan did not deny that the government might act to "manage an orderly liquidation" of a large financial "intermediary" in a crisis, but he suggested that only insured creditors would be fully repaid, that shareholders would be unprotected, and that uninsured creditors would receive less than full payment through a discount or "haircut."&lt;ref&gt;Stern 2000, p. 9.  {{Citation| title=Remarks of Chairman Alan Greenspan at the 36th Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, "Banking evolution" | publisher=Federal Reserve Board|date=May 4, 2000| page=3 |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs/speeches/2000/20000504.htm |accessdate=February 23, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators pointed to the 1990 failure of [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]] as suggesting "too-big-to-fail" considerations need not force a government rescue of creditors to a failing investment bank or other nonbank,&lt;ref&gt;Wilmarth 1995, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; although Greenspan had pointed to that experience as questioning the ability of firewalls to isolate one part of a financial firm from the rest.&lt;ref name="firewallsVG" /&gt;

After the [[late-2000s financial crisis]] commentators noted that the Federal Reserve Board used its power to grant exemptions from Federal Reserve Act Section 23A (part of the 1933 Banking Act and the "principle statutory" firewall between banks and their affiliates) to permit banks to "rescue" various affiliates or bank sponsored participants in the "shadow banking system" as part of a general effort to restore liquidity in financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;Omarova 2011, pp. 1725-1756.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 23A generally prevented banks from funding securities purchases by their affiliates before the financial crisis (i.e., prevented the affiliates from "using insured deposits to purchase risky investments") by "limiting the ability of depository institutions to transfer to affiliates the subsidy arising from the institutions' access to the federal safety net," but the Federal Reserve Board's exemptions allowed banks to transfer such investments from the shadow banking market to FDIC insured banks during the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Omarova 2011, pp. 1689-1690, 1728, and 1734.&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Reserve Board's General Counsel has defended these actions by arguing that all the Section 23A exemptions required that bank funding of affiliate or shadow banking investments be "fully collateralized" on a daily basis with qualifying collateral, so that the bank was "very much protected," and that in the end the exemptions did not prove very "useful."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Alvarez|first=Scott |title=FCIC Interview of Scott Alvarez and Kieran Fallon|publisher=[[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]]| date=March 23, 2010|pages=62–67|url=http://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-testimony/2010-0901-Scott-Alvarez-Kiernan-Fallon.pdf|accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICB proposes to erect a barrier between the "ring-fenced bank" and its "wider corporate group" that will permit banking regulators to isolate the ring-fenced bank "from the rest of the group in a matter of days and continue the provision of its services without providing solvency support."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICB|2011|pp=235–236}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limited purpose banking and narrow banking===
[[Laurence Kotlikoff]] was disappointed the ICB did not adopt the "limited purpose banking" he proposed to the ICB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url =http://blogs.ft.com/economistsforum/2011/09/why-the-vickers-report-failed-the-uk-and-the-world/#axzz1lio3loxx| title=Why the Vickers Report failed the UK and the World|date=September 20, 2011| work =Economists' Forum| publisher = [[Financial Times]]| accessdate = February 6, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kot"&gt;{{citation| last=Kotlikoff|first=Laurence| title=Open letter to Sir John Vickers on his banking reform speech | date=January 28, 2011| work =Economists' Forum| publisher = Financial Times| url=http://blogs.ft.com/economistsforum/2011/01/open-letter-to-sir-john-vickers-on-his-banking-reform-speech/#axzz1lio3loxx| accessdate = February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would require a bank to operate like a [[mutual fund]] in repaying "deposits" based on the current market value of the bank's assets. Kotlikoff argues there will always be financial crises if banks lend deposits but are required to repay the full amount of those deposits "on demand."&lt;ref&gt;Kotlikoff 2010, pp. 84-89.&lt;/ref&gt; Kotlikoff would only permit a bank (restructured as a mutual fund) to promise payment of deposits at "par" (i.e., $1 for every $1 deposited) if the bank (i.e., mutual fund) held 100% of all deposits in cash as a trustee.&lt;ref name="Kot" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kotlikoff 2010, pp. 123-124 and 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Kotlikoff notes, in 1987 Robert Litan proposed "narrow banking."&lt;ref&gt;Kotlikoff 2010, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Litan suggested commercial banking firms be freed from Glass–Steagall limits (and other activity restrictions) so long as they isolated FDIC insured deposits in a "narrow bank" that was only permitted to invest those deposits in "safe securities" approved by the FDIC.&lt;ref&gt;Litan 1987, pp. 70-71 and 164-178..&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Arthur Wilmarth proposed applying Litan's "narrow bank" proposal to U.S. banks ("global banks") that had become heavily involved in "capital markets" activities through "Section 20 affiliates," derivatives, and other activities.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmarth 1995, pp. 77-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Wilmarth's proposal (which he repeated in 2001 after the GLBA became law&lt;ref&gt;Wilmarth 2001, pp. 73-81.&lt;/ref&gt;) only banks that limited their activities to taking deposits and making commercial loans would be permitted to make commercial loans with FDIC insured deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmarth 1995, pp. 81-83.  Wilmarth 2001, pp. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt; Wilmarth expected only "community banks" specialized in making consumer and small business loans would continue to operate as such traditional banks.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmarth 1995, pp. 82-3.  Wilmarth 2001, pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt; The large "global banks" would fund their lending through the capital markets just like investment banks and other "shadow banking" lenders.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmarth 1995, pp. 86-87.  Wilmarth 2001, pp. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Narrow banking and wholesale financial institutions====

The Litan and Wilmarth proposals were very different from the Kotlikoff limited purpose banking proposal in that they would only limit the activities of companies that owned FDIC insured banks. Whereas Kotlikoff would require a company to hold the full amount of its "demand deposits" in cash, Litan and Wilmarth would permit companies to issue such "demand deposits" without restriction, so long as the demand deposits were not FDIC insured. Congress considered this type of proposal when it debated the repeal of Glass-Steagall sections 20 and 32.

In 1997 the Clinton Administration proposed that "wholesale financial institutions" (known as "woofies") be authorized to be members of the Federal Reserve System but not "banks" under the Bank Holding Company Act because they would own non-FDIC insured banks that would only take deposits of $100,000 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Pottinger| first=Matt | title=Rubin Pitches Plan on Bank Deregulation | newspaper =[[Chicago Tribune]]| date=June 4, 1997 | page=1}}.  {{Citation| last=Hawke, Jr.| first=John D. | title=Text as Prepared for Delivery: Treasury Undersecretary For Domestic Finance, John D.

The proposal was intended to permit securities firms to continue to maintain ownership of commercial firms while gaining access to the Federal Reserve's "[[payment system]]" and "[[discount window]]", so long as the firm did not take FDIC insured deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt 1998 ("A Competitive Two-Way Street").  {{Citation| last=Wayne| first=Leslie | title=Push for Wholesale Banks stalls in Overhaul of Law | newspaper =[[New York Times]]| date=July 7, 1999 | page=2|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/07/business/push-for-wholesale-banks-stalls-in-overhaul-of-law.html|accessdate=February 21, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Woofies" were not authorized by the GLBA because of a dispute between Senator Phil Gramm and the Clinton Administration over the application of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) to "woofies." In their October 1999 compromise on CRA provisions in the GLBA,&lt;ref name="CRA" /&gt; the Clinton Administration agreed with Gramm that CRA would not apply to woofies so long as only a company that did not then own any FDIC insured [[depository institution]] would be permitted to qualify as a "wholesale financial institution."&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{citation| last=Day| first=Kathleen | title=Wholesale Banks Cut from Overhaul Bill | newspaper=[[Washington Post]]| date=October 28, 1999 | page=E.02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clinton Administration wanted this restriction to prevent existing bank holding companies from disposing of their FDIC insured banks to qualify as "woofies," which could reduce the deposit base subject to CRA requirements.&lt;ref name="AmBan"&gt;{{citation| last=Anason| first=Dean | title=Capital Briefs: Wholesale Banking Cut from Reform Bill | newspaper=[[American Banker]]| date=October 28, 1999 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Chase and J.P. Morgan lobbied to change the final legislation to permit them to become woofies, they complained only [[Goldman Sachs]] and "a few others" could qualify as a woofie.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AmBan" /&gt; When negotiators decided they could not resolve the dispute, permission for woofies was eliminated from the final GLBA.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AmBan" /&gt;

"Woofies" were similar to the "global bank" structure suggested by Arthur Wilmarth because they would not use FDIC insured deposits to make commercial loans. They would, however, be subject to Federal Reserve supervision unlike lenders in the unsupervised "shadow banking" system. Because woofies would have had access to the Federal Reserve discount window and payments service, critics (including the [[Independent Community Bankers of America|Independent Bankers Association of America]] and Paul Volcker) opposed woofies (and a similar 1996 proposal by Representative James A. Leach) for providing unfair competition to banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://archives.financialservices.house.gov/banking/5797iba.shtml|title=Statement of The Independent Bankers Association of America before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, on Financial Restructuring|publisher=The Committee on Financial Services| date=May 7, 1997| page=5 ("Wholesale Financial Institutions")|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}  {{citation| last =de Senerpont Domas| first =Olaf | title =Volcker Plays Down Usefulness of Firewalls in Remarks to Panel | newspaper =[[American Banker]]| page=2("Why should this particular class of institution be free of federal deposit insurance when it will be competing side by side with banks that have to pay deposit insurance premiums?")|date =April 6, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although October 1999 press reports suggested bank holding companies were interested in becoming woofies,&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AmBan" /&gt; the New York Times reported in July 1999 that banking and securities firms had lost interest in becoming woofies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Wayne| first=Leslie | title=Push for Wholesale Banks stalls in Overhaul of Law | newspaper =[[New York Times]]| date=July 7, 1999 | page=2|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/07/business/push-for-wholesale-banks-stalls-in-overhaul-of-law.html|accessdate=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shadow banking in financial reform proposals===
The ICB Report rejected "narrow banking" in part because it would lead to more credit (and all credit during times of stress) being provided by a "less regulated sector."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICB|2011}}, Chapter 3.21, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 [[Jane D'Arista]] and Tom Schlesinger noted that the "parallel banking system" had grown because it did not incur the regulatory costs of commercial banks.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arista and Schlesinger 1993, pp. 11-14.&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed to equalize the cost by establishing "uniform regulation" of banks and the lenders and investors in the parallel banking system.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arista and Schlesinger 1993, p. 32-38.&lt;/ref&gt; As with Kotlikoff's "limited purpose banking" proposal, only investment pools funded 100% from equity interests would remain unregulated as banks.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arista and Schlesinger 1993, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Although D'Arista and Schlesinger acknowledged the regulation of banks and of the parallel banking system would end up only being "comparable," their goal was to eliminate so far as possible the competitive advantages of the "parallel" or "shadow" banking market.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arista and Schlesinger 1993, pp. 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commentators have argued that the failure to regulate the shadow banking market was a primary cause of the financial crisis.&lt;ref name="D&amp;K" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|FCIC|2011|pp=xvii, xx, 27–37, 255, 414, and 469}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is general agreement that the crisis emerged in the shadow banking markets not in the traditional banking market.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Regulating the Shadow Banking System |last1=Gorton |first1=Gary |last2=Metrick|first2=Andrew|author-link=Gary Gorton|date=October 18, 2010 |pages=15–16 |ssrn=1676947 }}.  {{harvnb|FCIC|2011|pp= 245, 275, 343, 427, 446, and 478}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As described in the article [[Decline of the Glass–Steagall Act]], Helen Garten had identified the "consumerization" of banking regulation as producing "a largely unregulated, sophisticated wholesale market,"&lt;ref name="wholesale" /&gt; which created the risk of the "underproduction of regulation" of that market.&lt;ref&gt;Garten 1999, pp. 304-307.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurence Kotlikoff's "limited purpose banking" proposal rejects bank regulation (based on rules and supervision to ensure "safety and soundness") and replaces it with a prohibition on any company operating like a traditional "bank." All limited liability financial companies (not only today's "banks") that receive money from the public for investment or "lending" and that issue promises to pay amounts in the future (whether as insurance companies, hedge funds, securities firms, or otherwise) could only issue obligations to repay amounts equal to the value of their assets.&lt;ref name="Kot" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kotlikoff 2010, pp. 122-124.&lt;/ref&gt; All "depositors" in or "lenders" to such companies would become "investors" (as in a mutual fund) with the right to receive the full return on the investments made by the companies (minus fees) and obligated to bear the full loss on those investments.&lt;ref name="Kot" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kotlikoff 2010, pp. 126 and 131-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hoenig]] rejects both "limited purpose banking" and the proposal to regulate shadow banking as part of the banking system. Hoenig argues it is not necessary to regulate "shadow banking system" lenders as banks if those lenders are prohibited from issuing liabilities that function like bank demand deposits. He suggests that requiring money market funds to redeem shares at the funds' fluctuating daily net asset values would prevent those funds from functioning like bank checking accounts and that eliminating special [[Bankruptcy in the United States|Bankruptcy Code]] treatment for [[repurchase agreement]]s would delay repayment of those transactions in a bankruptcy and thereby end their treatment as "[[cash equivalents]]" when the "repo" was funding illiquid, long term securities. By limiting the ability of "shadow banks" to compete with traditional banks in creating "money-like" instruments, Hoenig hopes to better assure that the safety net is not ultimately called upon to "bail them [i.e., shadow banks such as Bear Stearns and AIG during the financial crisis] out in a crisis." He proposes to deal with actual commercial banks by imposing "Glass–Steagall-type boundaries" so that banks "that have access to the safety net should be restricted to certain core activities that the safety net was intended to protect—making loans and taking deposits—and related activities consistent with the presence of the safety net."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hoenig |first=Thomas | title=Do SIFIs Have a Future |date=June 27, 2011 |work=Keynote remarks to "Dodd-Frank One Year On," Pew Financial Reform Project and New York University Stern School of Business Conference |location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City|pages=5 and 7–8 |url=http://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/speeches/Hoenig-NYUPewConference-06-27-11.pdf |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glass–Steagall references in financial reform proposals===
Although the UK's ICB and the commentators presenting the proposals described above to modify banks or banking regulation address issues beyond the scope of the Glass–Steagall separation of commercial and investment banking, each specifically examines Glass–Steagall. The ICB stated Glass–Steagall had been "undermined in part by the development of derivatives."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICB|2011}}, p. 36, fn. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The ICB also argued that the development before 1999 of "the world's leading investment banks out of the US despite Glass–Steagall in place at the time" should caution against assuming the "activity restrictions" it recommended in its "ring fencing" proposal would hinder UK investment banks from competing internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ICB|2011|p=146}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boston University]] economist Laurence J. Kotlikoff suggests commercial banks only became involved with CDOs, SIVs, and other "risky products" after Glass–Steagall was "repealed," but he rejects Glass–Steagall reinstatement (after suggesting Paul Volcker favors it) as a "non-starter" because it would give the "nonbank/shadow bank/investment bank industry" a "competitive advantage" without requiring it to pay for the "implicit" "lender-of-last-resort" protection it receives from the government.&lt;ref&gt;Kotlikoff 2010, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Litan and Arthur Wilmarth presented their "narrow bank" proposals as a basis for eliminating Glass–Steagall (and other) restrictions on bank affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;Litan 1987, pp. 164-178. Wilmarth 1995, pp. 80-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1993, Jane D'Artista and Tom Schlesinger noted that "the ongoing integration of financial industry activities makes it increasingly difficult to separate banking and securities operations meaningfully" but rejected Glass–Steagall repeal because "the separation of banking and securities functions is a proven, least-cost method of preventing the problems of one financial sector from spilling over into the other" (which they stated was "most recently demonstrated in the October 1987 market crash.")&lt;ref&gt;D'Arista and Schlesinger 1993, pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Senate debate of the bill that became the Dodd–Frank Act, Thomas Hoenig wrote Senators Maria Cantwell and John McCain (the co-sponsors of legislation to reinstate Glass–Steagall Sections 20 and 32) supporting a "substantive debate" on "the unintended consequences of leaving investment banking commingled with commercial banking" and reiterating that he had "long supported" reinstating "Glass–Steagall-type laws" to separate "higher risk, often more leveraged, activities of investment banks" from commercial banking. As described above in [[#Post 2010 efforts to enact Glass–Steagall inspired financial reform legislation|post 2010 efforts to enact Glass–Steagall inspired financial reform legislation]] Elizabeth Warren and other Senators have joined Cantwell and McCain in their effort to legislate Glass–Steagall inspired restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://washpost.bloomberg.com/Story?docId=1376-MPS5FJ0YHQ0X01-7P8MUFPFOE5Q0DB5D0D71D4HII | work=Bloomberg | title=Warren Joins McCain to Push New Glass-Steagall Law for Banks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoenig agreed with Paul Volcker, however, that "financial market developments" had caused underwriting corporate bonds (the prohibition of which Volcker described as the purpose of Glass–Steagall&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt;), and also underwriting of corporate equity, revenue bonds, and "high quality asset-backed securities," to be "natural extensions of commercial banking." Instead of reinstating Glass–Steagall prohibitions on such underwriting, Hoenig proposed restoring "the principles underlying the separation of commercial and investment banking firms."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hoenig |first=Thomas | title=Letter to The Honorable Senator Maria Cantwell and The Honorable Senator John McCain |date=May 10, 2010 |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City|url=http://www.kc.frb.org/SpeechBio/HoenigPDF/Cantwell.McCain.Letter.05.10.10.pdf |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mainland Europe]], some scholars have suggested Glass–Steagall should be a model for any in-depth reform of [[bank regulation]]: notably in [[France]] where [[SFAF]] and [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] banking experts have argued that "a new Glass–Steagall Act" should be viewed within the broader context of [[separation of powers]] in [[European Union law]].&lt;ref name="Le Parisien "&gt;{{Cite news|author=M. Nicolas J. Firzli quoted by Marie Lepesant|title= Le Modèle des Banques Françaises en Question|url= http://www.leparisien.fr/milibris/liseuse/LeParisien/?type=le-parisien-economie&amp;date=20120611| work=Le Parisien Aujourd'hui en France |date= June 11, 2012  |accessdate= 12 June 2012  | location=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This perspective has gained ground after the unraveling of the [[Libor scandal]] in July 2012, with mainstream opinion leaders such as the [[Financial Times]] editorialists calling for the adoption of an EU-wide "Glass Steagall II".&lt;ref name="FT "&gt;{{Cite news | first= Page |last= Editorial|title= Restoring trust after Diamond|url= http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/498248bc-c518-11e1-b8fd-00144feabdc0.html#axzz20iPBjEvM| work=[[Financial Times]] |date= July 3, 2012  |accessdate= 15 July 2012}} quoting FT Editorial Page.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2012, former Citigroup Chairman and CEO [[Sandy Weill]], considered one of the driving forces behind the considerable financial [[deregulation]] and "mega-[[merger]]s" of the 1990s, surprised financial analysts in Europe and North America by "calling for splitting up the commercial banks from the investment banks. In effect, he says: bring back the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 which led to half a century, free of financial crises."&lt;ref name="Forbes "&gt;{{Cite news|first=Steve |last=Denning|title= Rethinking Capitalism: Sandy Weill Says Bring Back Glass–Steagall|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2012/07/25/rethinking-capitalism-sandy-weill-says-bring-back-glass-steagall/| work=[[Forbes]] |date= July 25, 2012  |accessdate= 25 July 2012}} Quoting interview on CNBC's Squawk-Box.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Weill reversed his position a year later, arguing that "big banks don't have to be split if the 'right regulation' is in place," and instead that "[banks] should decide on their own to 'split if they figure that's the best way that they can provide their services.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Matthew J. |last=Belvidere|title= Big banks don't need to be split up: Sandy Weill |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101021490| work=[[CNBC.com]] |date= September 10, 2013  |accessdate= 19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''HUD-1 Settlement Statement''' was a standard form in use in the [[United States of America]] which was used to itemize services and fees charged to the borrower by the lender or broker when applying for a loan for the purpose of purchasing or refinancing real estate. HUD refers to the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]].

The borrower had the right to inspect the HUD-1 one day prior to day of settlement. The form would have been filled out by the settlement agent who would conduct the settlement.

Beginning in 2010, the HUD-1 settlement statement also contained what was referred to as a [[Good Faith Estimate]] or GFE. This additional set of figures specified estimated settlement figures provided by the lender upon application of the loan.

Borrowers could compare their Good Faith Estimate to the HUD-1 Settlement Statement and ask their lender or broker about any changes.

As part of new rules established by the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] effective October 3, 2015, the HUD-1 Settlement Statement became obsolete. It has been replaced by a document called the Closing Disclosure that consolidates the HUD-1, Good Faith Estimate, and [[Truth in Lending Act]] disclosures.

An '''heir presumptive''' or '''heiress presumptive''' is the person entitled to inherit a throne, peerage, or other hereditary honour, but whose position can be displaced by the birth of an [[heir apparent]], male or female, or of a new heir presumptive with a better claim to the position in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://definitions.uslegal.com/h/heir-presumptive/|title=Heir Presumptive Law &amp; Legal Definition|publisher=USLegal.com|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-definition/presumptive%20nominee|title=Heir presumptive|publisher=Reverso.net|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position is however subject to law and/or conventions that may alter who is entitled to be heir presumptive.

Depending on the rules of the monarchy the heir presumptive might be the daughter of a monarch (if [[Primogeniture|males take priority]] over females and the monarch has no sons), or the senior member of a collateral line (if the monarch is childless); the birth of a legitimate child  to the monarch will displace the former heir presumptive by a new heir apparent or heir presumptive. It is not assumed that the monarch and his or her consort are incapable of having further children; the day before [[Queen Elizabeth II]] ascended the throne, her father, [[George VI]], was gravely ill and her mother was in her early 50s, but Elizabeth was still considered the heir presumptive rather than the heir apparent.

Heir presumptive, like heir apparent, is not a title or position ''per se''. Rather, it is a general term for a person who holds a certain place in the [[order of succession]]. In some monarchies, the heir apparent bears, ''[[ipso facto]]'', a specific title and rank (e.g., Denmark, Netherlands, United Kingdom), this also sometimes being the case for noble titleholders (e.g., Spain, United Kingdom), but the heir presumptive does not bear that title. In other monarchies (e.g., Monaco, Spain) the heir to the throne bears a specific title (i.e., "Hereditary Prince/Princess of Monaco", "Prince/Princess of Asturias") by right, regardless of whether she or he is heir apparent or heir presumptive.

An heir can fail to inherit for other reasons than displacement, for example by death or incapacity of the heir, abolition of the title, or changes to the rules of inheritance.

==Simultaneous heirs presumptive==
{{Main|Abeyance}}
In the [[English law|English and Welsh common law]] of [[inheritance]], there is no seniority between sisters; where there is no son to inherit, any number of daughters share equally.  Therefore, certain hereditary titles can have multiple simultaneous heirs presumptive. Since the title cannot be held by two people simultaneously, two daughters (without a brother) who inherit in this way would do so as [[co-parceners]] and before they inherit, both would be heirs presumptive. In these circumstances, the title would in fact be held in [[abeyance]] until one person represents the claim of both, or the claim is renounced by one or the other for herself and her heirs, or the abeyance is ended by the Crown.  There are [[Peerage law#Peerage disputes|special procedures]] for handling doubtful or disputed cases.

==Heirs presumptive as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}==

If her father has a legitimate son, he would be heir apparent and Leonor would lose her titles and move back one place in the line of succession.
*[[Dipangkorn Rasmijoti|Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti]] is the heir presumptive to [[Vajiralongkorn|King Vajiralongkorn]] of [[Thailand]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34581">Throughout the '''history of [[criminal justice]]''', evolving forms of [[punishment]], added [[rights]] for [[offender]]s and victims, and [[policing]] reforms have reflected changing [[customs]], political ideals, and economic conditions.

==Background==
Primates often have notions of fairness and sharing, with violations punished by exclusion or banishment from social groups.  In human history,  prior to agriculture, more nomadic cultures had systems of punishment for behavior or resistance, including those developed by the Huns throughout Mongolia.  With the development of agriculture, which led to more closely populated cities and cultures and behavior to address fears of persons taking advantage of or causing harm to others, more formal systems of punishment for crimes developed, independently around the world, or based upon other cultures, including those developed in the early Babylonian laws of Hammurabi and the Hammurabic Code.

==Ancient China ==
Law enforcement in [[History of China|Ancient China]] was carried out by "prefects." The notion of a "prefect" in China has existed for thousands of years. The prefecture system developed in both the [[Chu (state)|Chu]] and [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] kingdoms of the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] period. In Jin, dozens of prefects were spread across the state, each having a limited authority and employment period.

In Ancient China, under the rule of Dang Lin Wang, a new judicial system emerged. This new system had prefects appointed by local magistrates, who in turn were appointed by the head of state, usually the emperor of the dynasty. The prefects oversaw the civil administration of their "[[Prefecture (China)|prefecture]]", or jurisdiction.

Prefects usually reported to the local magistrate, just as modern police report to judges. Under each prefect were "subprefects" who helped collectively with law enforcement of the area. Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations, much like modern police [[detective]]s.

Eventually the concept of the "prefecture system" would spread to other cultures such as Korea and Japan. Law enforcement in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]] was also relatively progressive, allowing for female prefects. Some examples of ancient Chinese prefects include: Chong Fu - prefect of the Ying District in the East Han Dynasty and Ching Chow - prefect of the modern Shang-tung Province. An example of a female prefect would be Lady Qu&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, Jake. "UC Davis East Asian Studies".

== Pre-modern Europe ==
For the most part, crime was viewed as a private matter in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].  Even with offenses as serious as murder, justice was the prerogative of the victim's family and [[private war]] or vendetta the means of protection against criminality.  Publicly owned slaves were used by magistrates as police in Ancient Greece.  In [[Athens]], a group of 300 [[Scythian]] slaves was used to guard public meetings to keep order and for [[crowd control]], and also assisted with dealing with [[criminals]], manhandling prisoners, and making arrests. Other duties associated with modern policing, such as investigating crimes, were left to the citizens themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Hunter| first =Virginia J.| title =Policing Athens: Social Control in the Attic Lawsuits, 420-320 B.C.| publisher =Princeton University Press| year =1994| location =Princeton, NJ| url =http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5349.html| id =ISBN| page =3| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070421233311/http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5349.html| archivedate =2007-04-21| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Empire]] had a reasonably effective law enforcement system until the decline of the empire, though there was never an actual police force in the city of Rome.

During the [[Middle Ages]], crime and punishment were dealt with through [[blood feud]]s (or [[trial by ordeal]]) between the parties. Payment to the victim (or their family), known as [[wergild]], was another common punishment, including for violent crimes. For those who could not afford to buy their way out of punishment, harsh penalties included various forms of [[corporal punishment]]. These included [[mutilation]], [[Flagellation|whipping]], [[human branding|branding]], and [[flogging]], as well as [[execution]]. [[Västgötalagen]] specifies exactly how much to pay, if anything, depending on who was slain. The primary form of state-administered punishment during ancient times and the [[Middle Ages]] was banishment or [[exile]]. Though a prison, [[Le Stinche]], existed as early as the 14th century in [[Florence, Italy|Florence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wolfgang, Marvin |year=1990 |title=Crime and Punishment in Renaissance Florence |journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |volume=81 |pages=567–584 |doi=10.2307/1143848|issue=3|publisher=The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (1973-), Vol. 81, No. 3|jstor=1143848}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[incarceration]] was not widely used until the 19th century. Rather, it was used to detain prisoners before trial or for imprisoning people without judicial process.

The Anglo-Saxon system of maintaining public order was a private system of [[Tithing (country subdivision)|tithings]], since the Norman conquest led by a [[constable]], which was based on a social obligation for the good conduct of the others; more common was that local lords and nobles were responsible to maintain order in their lands, and often appointed a [[constable]], sometimes unpaid, to enforce the law.

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
When early colonists first came to America, they did not include trained lawyers or other law-knowledgeable persons. Many parts of the criminal justice system in colonial America were similar to those in [[England]], [[France]], and the [[Dutch Republic]]. Gradually French and Dutch influences disappeared in the islands. What remained was the basic idea many had of the English [[common law]] system.

This system was the best-known to seventeenth-century colonists. The [[common law]] system included a set of rules that were used to solve problems in society. It was based on the history of decisions previous judges had made instead of lawmaking codes or laws. This system made a distinction between two basic types of crimes: [[felonies]] and [[misdemeanors]]. The legal process, mostly for more serious crimes, involved a grand jury, composed of members of the community, which decided whether there was enough evidence for prosecution. However, in these proceedings no district attorneys or public prosecutors were available. The victim of the crime was responsible for instigating the prosecution and financing it. It was these fundamental principles that stuck with the colonists and were used selectively to create a new and unique criminal justice system.

Many factors influenced the colonists’ selection process by which they constructed their approach to criminal justice. As previously mentioned, there were no professional legal experts and few law resources available. This left a lot of room for creativity and mistakes. The colonists were largely left to their own devices concerning the details of their developing criminal justice system. The new environment the colonists encountered in the New World, especially the western frontier, also affected the way the law was shaped. The system was molded to fit the colonists’ needs as they settled further and further west. Vigilantism was an inevitable byproduct of the faults of the development of justice in America. Religion, especially early on in the colonial period, exerted a strong influence on law making. Legal codes, such as the 1648 Book of the General Lawes and Libertyes of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, contained very strong biblical references, more so than did the ones in England. Although this religious impact was felt most strongly in Puritan colonies, similar ideas were evident among other colonists as well. Many colonial makeshift criminal codes considered lying, idleness, drunkenness, certain sexual offenses, and even bad behavior to be crimes. These moralistic crimes stemmed from the relation of crime to sin and sin to crime. Adding to the religious factor, the colonists held individual liberty in high regard. This later influenced more contemporary criminal codes.

===County sheriff===

Besides being one of the most important criminal justice officials of the colonial period in America, the county sheriff had other responsibilities. These included collecting taxes, running and supervising elections, and handling any other legal business in the community. With such a workload, sheriffs were usually the most important political figures in the county and represented the governor and the English government. In the criminal justice system of the period, the sheriff acted as a reactive official. His job was to follow up on complaints or information of misconduct from the other citizens. He was paid through a system of fees rather than a set salary which came mostly from tax collecting. This discouraged many sheriffs from concentrating heavily on law enforcement. Such high powers often led to corruption in this field with embezzlement and other irregularities with tax collections and fees.

===Judges and magistrates===

 Judges are also known as magistrates or justices of the peace. Even though a judge held very influential positions in their counties, they were far from the professionals that they are today. They were usually religious or political leaders. The county judge was in charge of the court for the area he presided in and vehemently believed their role in society was to enforce God’s will. Their understanding of God’s will usually caused colonial justices to seek confessions and repentance from the accused rather than just punishment. The main goal was to bring order back to society. Most of the minor cases in the county only involved the judge while more serious crimes were heard by a court of several judges. The courts met only periodically, slowing down the sentencing of serious crimes.

===Colonial courts===

Although the colonial courts did closely mimic the proceedings of the courts of England, they were much simpler and more informal. They were also made available to everyone and used to relieve tensions and conflicts in the community. In addition to hearing the disputes of the local colonists, the courts also held the responsibilities of the legislature, executive, and judicial branches of the county’s government. These responsibilities illustrated the highly unspecialized nature of colonial government agencies. The courts became connected to an informal role in the county’s social and economic life.
Although some county courts were presided over by one judge, some consisted of ten to fifteen judges. However, the courts with many judges met very infrequently and this made it almost impossible to conduct any legal business in a fast and efficient way. The matter was even worse in the back country where there often was a complete lack of courts to settle any conflicts or perform governmental services.

===Legal process===

The legal process of trials in colonial America was quite different from the modern one in many ways. After an alleged crime was reported, a magistrate, or judge, would consider the presented evidence and decide whether it was a true crime. If the magistrate decided that a crime was indeed committed the accused was apprehended and sent to be questioned by the magistrate. The interrogation was usually held in the magistrate’s own house with a few marshals or deputies as witnesses. However, during this step in the procedure, no lawyers were involved on behalf of either party. After the hearing the accused was usually free to leave until the trial without bail.

Just as in the interrogation, there was no defense attorney present at the trial and the proceedings moved quickly as each witness testified against the defendant. However, a district attorney, who was often appointed by the governor and assigned to a certain district or county, usually handled the prosecution. Unlike the prosecutors in England, who worked privately and for a payment from the victim, the district attorneys of colonial America handled the prosecution in almost all trials. The district attorney’s position soon became one of the most important political position in county government because they often had to be elected.

The role of the defense attorney was minuscule, if not unheard of, in the colonial period. This stemmed from an English legal tradition of severely restricting the role of the defense to challenging or question narrow points of the law. In time the American practice of trials allowed a greater and more vigorous role to the defense of the accused. However, at that current time there were few trained lawyers to begin with and most defendants could not afford one.

Juries were also not used at that time and those who requested them were thought to be challenging the authority of the judge. Since the magistrate who had proclaimed the trial necessary was also the judge who presided over the trial, the verdict was quite often guilty. The main purpose of the trial was to give the defendant a chance to admit their guilt and repent. The theory behind the trial and punishment being very public was that they would serve to reinforce the rules of conduct and discourage others from acting out and breaking laws.

===Protection of cities===

The colonists soon realized that a sheriff was not enough to keep their colonies safe and crime-free. Many villages and cities began adding other criminal justice agents to help maintain order. The rising populations were proving to be too much to handle for just one law enforcement agent in the county. The mayor was originally the chief law enforcement official, but he acted only in extreme circumstances. In addition to the sheriff, the mayor appointed a high constable and several lesser constables and marshals to help him. Those holding such positions had powers similar to those of the sheriff.

To protect their citizens during the night, many counties established a night watch, an institution of criminal justice originally inherited from Europe. The night watch consisted of a group of civilians who patrolled and kept watch over the city, making sure to look for fires, suspicious individuals, or possible riots. This was a collective responsibility, but few were willing to serve. Certain cities imposed fines on those who refused.

The night watch, though relatively effective, only served during the night. During the day, the responsibility of protecting innocent citizens and apprehending criminals fell to the constables and marshals. Soon a day watch was implemented in many areas. In extreme situations, such as riots, the colonial communities often had to call out the militia. Riots, a common disturbance in colonial America, occurred for many reasons including to contest elections, to protest economic conditions, or to enforce standards of morality. Even at the first sign of a riot the mayor or some other official would appear and literally read the riot act to the assembled crowd.

===Punishments===
Depending on the crimes that the colonists committed, there were plenty of punishments to choose from. Most of the punishments were public, where heavy use of shame and shaming was included. Through the method of shaming, the criminal justice system meant more to teach a lesson than simply punish the offender. The “criminal” was almost always male. However, punishment for such crimes as witchcraft, infanticide, and adultery fell heavily on the women. In addition, much of the blame and punishment for crimes was attributed to those in the lowest rank in society.

[[Flagellation|Whipping]] was the most commonly used form of punishment, especially in the south with slaves. Other frequently used punishments included branding, cutting off ears, and placing people in the [[pillory]]. These punishments were sometimes harsher, depending on the crimes committed. In the American colonies, executions were less common than in England. However, when such a method was used, it was most often a public hanging. Usually capital offenses, such as murder or rape, or repeated serious offenses constituted a need for an execution.

Imprisonment was uncommon in colonial America since the budding colonies did not have people to spare to keep the community in order. Every person was valuable for their working ability, and losing even one worker to lawkeeping was neither reasonable nor an efficient use of resources. In addition, colonial communities rarely had enough extra money to build a prison and feed prisoners.

Since probation was not yet known to the colonists, they used a system of nods to guarantee troublemakers would not cause any problems. Courts began to require many problem-causing people to put up money to make sure they would stay out of trouble. This system worked especially well in communities where everyone minded each other's business.

===County jails===

In the early colonial period, prisons were not yet a major staple in the criminal justice system. They were used mainly for holding people who were awaiting trial rather than punishment. The early jails resembled ordinary houses in many aspects and had no distinctive architectural features. Prisoners were placed in rooms instead of cells and were not classified or segregated in any way. Men, women, and juveniles were mixed together causing many problems.

Overcrowding soon became a big concern, as well as poor sanitation. The jails turned into breeding houses of illness. Furthermore, the jails were even unable to fulfill their basic purpose of containing offenders within its walls. Escapes were very frequent. The prisons held not only those who were awaiting trial but also people who owed money, called debtors. These people were free during the day so they could work to pay off their debt but they returned to the jail at night. Other prisoners included the homeless, unemployed, or impoverished. They were expected to learn good work ethic during their stay.

The financial arrangements of the jailer were similar to those of the sheriff, especially since the same person usually held both jobs. He was paid by the county through a system of fees. Specific items such as food, clothing, and other things were submitted to the county commissioners for money. Just like other criminal justice positions with a lot of power, the jailer was often corrupt and was notoriously known for embezzling public funds, soliciting bribes from prisoners and their families, selling whiskey to the prisoners, and abusing the inmates.

===Administration of justice in colonial America===

====Crime problem====
The gradual development of a sophisticated criminal justice system in America found itself extremely small and unspecialized during colonial times. Many problems, including lack of a large law-enforcement establishment, separate juvenile-justice system, and prisons and institutions of probation and parole. Criminal matters were also not the top priority of the sheriff and the courts. The lack of a large institutional framework was a result of relatively small and homogenous colonial communities. These colonies were self-policing and social control was maintained by an omnipresent set of informal restrictions. They also depended on community pressure to regulate human conduct.

== Invention of "police" ==
In Western culture, the contemporary concept of a police paid by the government was developed by French legal scholars and practitioners in the 17th century and early 18th century, notably with [[Nicolas Delamare]]'s ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20081112154147/http://cujas.synasoft.fr/page.asp?ouvrage=225 Traité de la Police]'' ("Treatise of the Police", published between 1705 and 1738). The German ''[[Polizeiwissenschaft]]'' (Science of Police) was also an important theoretical formulation of police.

The first police force in the modern sense was created by the government of King [[Louis XIV]] in 1667 to police the city of [[Paris]], then the largest city of Europe and considered the most dangerous European city. The royal edict, registered by the ''[[Parlement]]'' of Paris on March 15, 1667 created the office of ''[[Prefecture of Police#List of lieutenant generals and prefects of police|lieutenant général de police]]'' ("lieutenant general of police"), who was to be the head of the new Paris police force, and defined police as the task of "ensuring the peace and quiet of the public and of private individuals, purging the city of what may cause disturbances, procuring abundance, and having each and everyone live according to their station and their duties".{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} This office was held by [[Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie]], who had 44 ''commissaires de police'' (police commissioners) under his authority. In 1709, these commissioners were assisted by ''inspecteurs de police'' (police inspectors). The city of Paris was divided into 16 districts policed by the 44 ''commissaires de police'', each assigned to a particular district and assisted in their districts by clerks and a growing bureaucracy. The scheme of the Paris police force was extended to the rest of France by a royal edict of October 1699, resulting in the creation of lieutenants general of police in all large French cities or towns.

However, this early conceptualization of police was quite different from today's police forces, exclusively in charge of maintaining order and arresting criminals. As conceptualized by the ''[[Polizeiwissenschaft]]'', the police had an economical and social duty ("procuring abundance"). It was in charge of [[demographics]] concerns and of empowering the [[population]], which was considered by the [[mercantilist]] theory to be the main strength of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Thus, its functions largely overreached simple law enforcement activities, and included [[public health]] concerns, [[urban planning]] (which was important because of the [[miasma theory of disease]]; thus, [[cemeteries]] were moved out of town, etc.), surveillance of [[prices]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Foucault]], ''Security, Territory, Population'', 1977-78 course (published 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of modern police was contemporary to the formation of the state, later defined by sociologist [[Max Weber]] as detaining "the [[monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force]]", primarily exercised by the police and the [[military]].

=== Modern police ===
After the troubles of the [[French Revolution]] the Paris police force was reorganized by [[Napoléon I]] on February 17, 1800 as the [[Prefecture of Police]], along with the reorganization of police forces in all French cities with more than 5,000 inhabitants. On March 12, 1829, a government decree created the first uniformed policemen in Paris and all French cities, known as ''sergents de ville'' ("city sergeants"), which the Paris Prefecture of Police's website claims were the first uniformed policemen in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prefecture-police-paris.interieur.gouv.fr/documentation/bicentenaire/theme_expo4.htm Bicentenaire : theme_expo4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[London]], there existed watchmen hired to guard the streets at night since 1663. Watchmen were the first paid law enforcement in the country, augmenting the force of unpaid constables, but were not professionally organized. The word "police" was borrowed from French into the English language in the 18th century, but for a long time it applied only to French and continental European police forces. The word, and the concept of police itself, was "disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression" (according to ''[[Britannica 1911]]''). Prior to the 19th century, the only official use of the word "police" recorded in the United Kingdom was the appointment of Commissioners of Police for Scotland in 1714 and the creation of the [[Marine Police Force|Marine Police]] in 1798 (set up to protect merchandise at the [[Port of London]]).

On June 30, 1800, the authorities of [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] successfully petitioned the Government to pass the [[Glasgow Police Act]] establishing the [[City of Glasgow Police]]. This was the first professional police service in the world that differed from previous law enforcement in that it was a [[preventive police]] force. This was quickly followed in other Scottish towns, which set up their own police forces by individual Acts of Parliament [https://web.archive.org/web/20090716173010/http://www.scotia-news.com/issue5/ISSUE05a.htm]. On September 29, 1829, the [[Metropolitan Police Act]] was passed by Parliament, allowing Sir [[Robert Peel]], the then [[home secretary]], to found the London [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]]. Based on the [[Peelian principles]], this was the cities first full-time, professional and centrally-organised police force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metropolitan Police|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/laworder/policeprisons/overview/metropolitanpolice/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Meteropolitain Police officers were often referred to as ´Bobbies´ after Sir Robert (Bobby) Peel. They are regarded as the first modern police force and became a model for the police forces in most countries, such as the [[United States]], and most of the then British Empire (Commonwealth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Terrill|first1=Richard J.|title=World Criminal Justice Systems: A Comparative Survey|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317228820|page=32|edition=revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ3hCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dempsey|first1=John S.|last2=Forst|first2=Linda S.|title=An Introduction to Policing|date=2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1305544684|pages=6–8|edition=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W4TCBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bobbies can still be found in many parts of the world (for example in [[British Overseas Territories]] or ex-colonies such as Bermuda, Gibraltar or St Helena). The model of policing in Britain had as its primary role the keeping of the [[Queen's Peace]] and this has continued to the present day. [https://web.archive.org/web/20051230202637/http://www.together.gov.uk/article.asp?c=442&amp;aid=1275] Many of the Commonwealth countries developed police forces using similar models, such as Australia and New Zealand.
[[Image:Robert Peel - Project Gutenberg etext 13103.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Sir [[Robert Peel]]]]
In [[North America]], the [[Toronto Police]] was founded in Canada in 1834, one of the first municipal police departments on that continent, followed by police forces in [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]] both founded in 1838. In the [[United States]], the first organized police service was established in Boston in 1838, New York in 1844, and Philadelphia in 1854.

Early on, police were not respected by the community, as [[Police corruption|corruption]] was rampant.  In the late 19th and early 20th century, there were few specialized units in police departments.&lt;ref name="reiss-1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reiss Jr |author2=Albert J. |title=Police Organization in the Twentieth Century |journal=Crime and Justice |year=1992 |volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the [[Pennsylvania State Police]] became the first [[state police]] agency established in the United States, as recommended by [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s Anthracite Strike Commission and Governor [[Samuel Pennypacker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Justice to All: The Story of the Pennsylvania State Police |author=Mayo, Katherine |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of the police car, [[two-way radio]], and telephone in the early 20th century transformed policing into a reactive strategy that focused on responding to [[calls for service]].&lt;ref name="reiss-1992"/&gt; In the 1920s, led by [[Berkeley, California]] police chief, [[August Vollmer]], police began to professionalize, adopt new technologies, and place emphasis on training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Finest of the Finest |publisher=TIME Magazine |date=February 18, 1966 |url=http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899019,00.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014095649/http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C899019%2C00.html |archivedate=October 14, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this transformation, police command and control became more centralized. [[Orlando Winfield Wilson|O.W. Wilson]], a student of Vollmer, helped reduce [[Police corruption|corruption]] and introduce professionalism in [[Wichita, Kansas]], and later in the [[Chicago Police Department]].&lt;ref name="cdlib"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf3v19n6s0&amp;doc.view=entire_text |title=Guide to the Orlando Winfield Wilson Papers, ca. 1928-1972 |publisher=Online Archive of California |accessdate=2006-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategies employed by O.W. Wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption, establishing of a non-partisan police board to help govern the police force, a strict [[:wikt:merit|merit]] system for promotions within the department, and an aggressive, recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers.&lt;ref name="nytimes-1960"&gt;{{cite news |title=Chicago Chooses Criminologist to Head and Clean Up the Police |publisher=United Press International/The New York Times |date=February 22, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such reforms, police agencies were led by highly autocratic leaders, and there remained a lack of respect between police and the community. During the professionalism era of policing, law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with [[felony|felonies]] and other serious crime, rather than focusing on [[crime prevention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Evolving Strategy of Policing: Case Studies of Strategic Change |author=Kelling, George L., Mary A. Wycoff |date=December 2002 |publisher=National Institute of Justice |id={{NCJ|198029}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following urban unrest in the 1960s, police placed more emphasis on community relations, and enacted reforms such as increased diversity in hiring.  The [[Kansas City preventive patrol experiment|Kansas City Preventive Patrol study]] in the 1970s found the reactive approach to policing to be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/kcppe.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Kansas City Preventive Patrol Experiment - A Summary Report |publisher=Police Foundation |author=Kelling, George L., Tony Pate, Duane Dieckman, Charles E.

In the 1990s, many law enforcement agencies began to adopt [[community policing]] strategies, and others adopted [[problem-oriented policing]].  In the 1990s, [[CompStat]] was developed by the [[New York Police Department]] as an information-based system for tracking and [[crime mapping|mapping]] crime patterns and trends, and holding police accountable for dealing with crime problems.  CompStat, and other forms of information-led policing, have since been replicated in police departments across the United States and around the world.

==Prisons==
Until the late 19th century, law enforcement in the United States was a responsibility of local and state governments only. In 1870, with the passage of the [[Interstate Commerce Act]], the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] in the U.S. began to take on some law enforcement responsibilities, and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] was established in 1870, to carry out these duties.&lt;ref name="langeluttig-p9"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Department of Justice of the United States |author=Langeluttig, Albert |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press |year=1927 |pages=9–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1872, control of federal prisons was transferred to the new department, from the [[United States Department of Interior|Department of Interior]].  New facilities were built, including the penitentiary at [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Leavenworth]] in 1895, and a facility for women located in [[West Virginia]], at [[Alderson Federal Prison Camp|Alderson]] was established in 1924.&lt;ref name="langeluttig-p14"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Department of Justice of the United States |author=Langeluttig, Albert |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press |year=1927 |pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In re Himmel''''', 125 Ill.2d 531, 533 N.E.2d 790 (Ill. 1988), was a case decided by the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] that upheld the suspension of an attorney's license for [[Duty to report misconduct|failing to report misconduct]] by another attorney.

==Factual background==
Himmel, an attorney, agreed to represent the 18-year-old victim of a motorcycle accident to recover settlement money from her first attorney.  The client had won a $23,000 settlement after the accident, but her first attorney had allegedly pocketed the money instead.  The client asked Himmel not to report the first lawyer's misconduct to the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission (IARDC) because she feared that it would hinder the recovery efforts. Over the course of 24 months, Himmel brokered an agreement where the first attorney promised to pay $75,000 if the client agreed not to prosecute.

In 1986, the IADRC charged Himmel with a violation of Rule 1-103(a) of the Illinois Code of Professional Responsibility for failing to report the first attorney's misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Himmel'', 533 N.E.2d 790, 791 (Ill. 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
The court held that Himmel had a duty to report the misconduct of the first attorney under Rule 1-103(a), which requires lawyers with knowledge of misconduct by another lawyer to report it to the appropriate disciplinary authority.&lt;ref&gt;107 Ill.2d R. 1-103(a)&lt;/ref&gt;  The court held that the client's communication about the first attorney's misconduct was not protected by the [[attorney–client privilege]] because she had discussed the matter in the presence of non-privileged third parties (her mother and fiance).

The court upheld the IADRC's decision to suspend Himmel's license for one year.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Himmel'', 533 N.E.2d 790, 794 (Ill. 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
In the years preceding the decision, the Illinois and Chicago bars had been greatly criticized as a result of [[Operation Greylord]], in which lawyers failed to report the misconduct of other attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Wernz, To Report or Not to Report, Bench and Bar of Minnesota (December 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Months earlier, in a case cited in this decision, ''In re Anglin'', 122 Ill.2d 531, 525 N.E.2d 550 (May 18, 1988), the Illinois Supreme Court refused to reinstate the law license of an attorney convicted of (among other felonies) possessing stolen securities, and who wished to be reinstated while continuing to withhold the name of the person or persons from whom he received the stolen securities. These combined situations greatly increased the frequency of attorney misconduct reporting.  In 1988, 154 attorneys were reported for misconduct in Illinois.  In 1989, 922 attorneys were reported for misconduct&lt;ref&gt;Daryl van Duch, ''Best Snitches: Land of Lincoln Leads the Nation in Attorneys Turning in Their Peers''.  Natl. L.J., Jan. 27, 1997, at A1&lt;/ref&gt;

Often cited discussion of the ''Himmel'' rule are by Richard W. Burke in 3 Geo.J.Legal Ethics 643 (1989-1990) and by Bruce Green in 39 William &amp; Mary Law Review pp. 357-392 (vol.39, issue 2), although the case has been cited over 300 times, as well as at least mentioned in over 200 law reviews.&lt;ref&gt;google scholar search 1/3/15 finds 326 citing documents; hein online search discloses 202 article citations.&lt;/ref&gt; At least one lawyer has criticized the ''Himmel'' rule as more effective at fostering distrust among lawyers than at rooting out misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;Duch at A1&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, California declined to follow the ''Himmel'' rule and adopted Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code § 6068(o), which requires an attorney to self-report misconduct but not the misconduct of other attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code § 6068(o)&lt;/ref&gt; The Rhode Island Supreme Court also distinguished the case in  ''In re Ethics Advisory Panel Opinion No. 92-1'' &lt;ref&gt;627 A.2d 317 (R.I. June 25, 1993) (No. 93-41-M.P.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago Bar Association most recently published a mention of the decision in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;John Levin, You Got Questions? They Got Answers, 18 C.B.A. Rec. 47 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3515">The '''Landis Report''' was written by [[James M. Landis]] as a transition team analysis of the United States' administrative agencies for incoming President [[John F. Kennedy]] on December 21, 1960.  

A long-time friend of the Kennedy family, Landis served as a legal advisor to [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] and was President Kennedy's Special Counsel. At the time of the report, Landis was on the faculty of [[Harvard Law School]]. The report recommended greater clarity on the roles and authority of agency chairs. The Kennedy Administration adopted many of the report's recommendations.

==Summary==
The report reviewed the overall state of United States administrative law and the relationship between the independent agencies and the executive branch.  Landis expressed a concern for the backlog in administrative law cases and the cost of participating in administrative hearings. The report expressed concerns about ethic of administrative proceedings, including extensive ''ex parte'' communications.&lt;ref&gt;Report at p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative Conference of the United States==
A major recommendation of the Landis Report was the establishment of the [[Administrative Conference of the United States]], which is a permanent agency to study Federal administrative procedures and develop recommendations for improvement. Similar recommendations  were made during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations.&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum Convening the President's Commission on Administrative Procedure, Public Papers 219-22 (Apr. 29, 1953); [[Executive Order (United States)|Executive Order]] 10934, 26 Fed. Reg. 3233 (Apr. 13, 1961).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Landis Report recommended that legislation be adopted to establish a permanent agency.  Such legislation was adopted in 1964 after President Kennedy's death.&lt;ref&gt;Administrative Conference Act of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-499, 5 USC 591-596.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power of agency chairs==
Many federal administrative agencies have multiple members and operate as collegial bodies with one member designated as chairman. The report noted that before World War II, the main role of an agency chair was to preside at meetings, and agencies frequently rotated the chair duties among members annually.&lt;ref name=l11&gt;Landis Report at 11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, under post-World War II reorganization plans, the President was given the responsibility to designate the chair from among the agency's commissioners, and the chair was given the power to set the internal organization and policy direction of the agency.&lt;ref name=l11/&gt; Landis noted that most chairs did not exercise this added authority, leaving the leadership of the agency to group decision making.&lt;ref name=l11/&gt;  Landis  recommended that the reorganization plans for the Federal Power Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission be amended to make the chair of each agency serve at the pleasure of the President.&lt;ref name=l60&gt;Landis Report at 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Landis also recommended that the plans for the administrative agencies clarify that the chair sets the budget, allocates funds and appoints the staff.&lt;ref name=l60/&gt;

[[File:Mangalore tile.svg|thumb|widthpx|Mangalore tile]]
'''Mangalore tiles''' (also Mangalorean tiles) are a type of [[tile]] native&lt;ref name="appa61"/&gt; to the city of [[Mangalore]], [[India]]. Typically considered to be a part of Spanish and Italian architectural styles, the tiles were first introduced to India in 1860 by a [[Germany|German]] missionary.&lt;ref name="appa61"&gt;{{harvnb|Giriappa|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k8j7tyiCAFkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA61,M1 61]|Ref=appa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, the industry has flourished in India with these red tiles, prepared from hard [[laterite]] [[clay]], in great demand throughout the country. They are exported to [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]], and the [[Far East]] and even as far as [[East Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]]{{Citation needed|reason=according to whom? the linked article is a dead link|date=December 2013}}.&lt;ref name="hot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotfrog.in/Products/Mangalore-Tiles|title=Mangalore—Tiles|publisher=Hotfrog.in|accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the only tiles recommended for government buildings in India under the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="sm1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sm2"/&gt;
[[File:OldManglaortile.jpg|thumb|Old Manglore tiles, from an old site in Karachi, Pakistan.]]
These tiles still define Mangalore's skyline and characterize its urban setting.&lt;ref name="tile"/&gt; They are a popular form of roofing and are preferred over concrete due to their good quality.&lt;ref name="MVT"/&gt;

== Etymology ==
These tiles are native to [[Mangalore]], a city in the former [[South Canara]] district on the [[Geography of India|western coast of India]].  Hence they were named ''Mangalore tiles'' by the tile factory manufacturers.&lt;ref name="appa61"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Feroke Tile factory.jpg|thumbnail|Tile Factory in [[Feroke]], India]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MAngaloretilesss.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Image of the old traditionally prepared handmade Mangalore tile]]  --&gt;
The German missionary [[Plebot]] (Georg Plebst in reality) set up the first tile factory at Mangalore in 1860,&lt;ref name="appa61"/&gt; after he found large deposits of clay by the banks of the [[Gurupura river|Gurupura]] (also Phalguni) and [[Nethravathi river|Nethravathi]] (also Bantwal) rivers. It was called "The CommonWealth Trust Ltd." or locally referred to as [[Basel Mission tile factory]], and was the first ever tile factory in India, located on the banks of the Nethravathi river, near [[Morgan's Gate]],&lt;ref name="gov2"/&gt; around {{convert|100|m|km}} from [[Ullal]] bridge.&lt;ref name="tile"/&gt; Currently Mphasis, An HP company has been established in this area.

Several other tile factories were established in the years that followed. In 1868, the [[Albuquerque tile factory]] producing these tiles was started by Mr.Pascal Albuquerque at [[Panemangalore, Karnataka|Panemangalore]] in South Canara.&lt;ref name="sm2"&gt;{{harvnb|Somerset|Bond|Wright|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8WNEcgMr11kC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA517,M1 511]|Ref=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the only tiles to be recommended for Government buildings in India during the British regime.&lt;ref name="sm1"&gt;{{harvnb|Somerset|Bond|Wright|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8WNEcgMr11kC&amp;pg=PA509&amp;lpg=RA1-PA516&amp;vq=&amp;dq=&amp;sig=ACfU3U1Shfg7Vate1ZGHKqcD_GgO1ZsEnA#PPA516,M1 510]|Ref=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus]], a [[World Heritage Site]] is also topped with these tiles due to their excellent quality and were preferred over Bombay tiles by the structure's architect [[Frederick William Stevens]].&lt;ref name="MVT"&gt;{{cite web

Since the opening of the Albuquerque tile factory, [[Mangaloreans]] have been actively involved in manufacturing these red Mangalore tiles.&lt;ref name="sm2"/&gt; In 1878, it was followed by the [[Alvares tile factory]] established by Mr.Simon Alvares of [[Mumbai|Bombay]] at Mangalore. The tiles produced by the factory were in great demand throughout the [[Indian subcontinent]] and East Africa.&lt;ref name="sm3"&gt;{{harvnb|Somerset|Bond|Wright|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8WNEcgMr11kC&amp;pg=PA509&amp;lpg=RA1-PA516&amp;vq=&amp;dq=&amp;sig=ACfU3U1Shfg7Vate1ZGHKqcD_GgO1ZsEnA#PPA517,M1 517]|Ref=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abundant deposits of clay, plenty of firewood from the [[Western Ghats]] and cheap skilled labour helped the industry flourish.&lt;ref name="tile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2007/02/17/stories/2007021701030100.htm|title=Tiles for style |last=Babu|first=Savitha Suresh|date=2007-02-17|publisher=''[[The Hindu]]''|accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1900s there were around 25 tile factories situated in and around Mangalore. By 1994 around 75 tile factories were present in Mangalore.&lt;ref name="appa61"/&gt; As per the years 1991—1992 out of a selected 12 tile factories, 6 were owned by [[Hindus]] and the other 6 by [[Christian]]s. The factories along with these tiles also manufactured materials such as [[Ridge (geometry)|ridges]], [[limestone]]&lt;ref name="sm1"/&gt; and [[brick]]s.&lt;ref name="appa62"&gt;{{harvnb|Giriappa|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k8j7tyiCAFkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA62,M1 62]|Ref=appa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominent tile factories in Mangalore of the bygone era were&lt;br&gt;
1) The Common Wealth Trust Ltd (Established by Basel Mission in 1860 &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=k8j7tyiCAFkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;) - This is supposed to be the first tile factory in Mangalore and thereby India.&lt;br&gt;
2) A Albuquerque and Sons (Established in 1868).&lt;br&gt;
3) Alvares Tile factory (Established by Simon Alvares in 1878)&lt;br&gt;
4) Hammer Tiles (Established by Mahalakshmi traders in 1889).&lt;br&gt;
5) Hamidiah Tile works (Established by [[Adhyaksha H. Coragappa]](Founder of Kudroli Shree [[Gokarnanatheshwara Temple]] [[Mangalore]] &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gokarnanatheshwara_Temple&lt;/ref&gt;) and C.Abdurahiman in 1905)&lt;br&gt;
6) King George Tiles (Established in 1905).&lt;br&gt;
7) JH Morgan and son. &lt;br&gt;
8) Rego and sons.&lt;br&gt;
9) Pioneer Tiles.&lt;br&gt;
10) BK Tiles.&lt;br&gt;

The Calicut Tile Co. (CTC) was the first fully mechanised roofing tile manufacturer in India. It was started in the year 1878. Besides roofing tiles, CTC also manufactures ceiling tiles, hourdees, hollow blocks, paver tiles, decorative garden tiles and terracotta products.  The company is currently fully operational. The products CTC at Ferok are known and sold under the brand name QUEEN. They have another factory in the state of Karnataka. The products are known under the brand name KING. 

In 2007, the industry suffered a loss with about 10 tile factories shutting down due to scarcity of raw materials like clay, and as factories struggled to find skilled and cooperative workers.&lt;ref name="gov2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/11/12/stories/2007111256740500.htm|title=Tiles are strong, industry is brittle |last=Belgaumkar|first=Govind D.|date=2007-11-12|publisher=''[[The Hindu]]''|accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality and Usage==
[[File:Mangalore tiled roof 20071228.jpg|thumb|200px|right|These tiles define Mangalore's skyline and characterize its urban setting]]
They provide excellent ventilation especially during summer and are [[aesthetic]]ally pleasing as well. Some of them are especially made to be used for roofing kitchens (for the smoke to escape) and bathrooms. Over a period of time, these tiles become dark to black from constant exposure to [[soot]] and smoke. Clay tiles offer natural insulation, thereby reducing the expense on electricity for heating or cooling as the case may be. 

Since these clay tiles are molded under extreme heat, they are resistant to damage or destruction from fire. 

These red colored clay tiles, unique in shape and size, are quite famous and are exported to all the corners of world. They are unique and are made and available in different shapes and sizes depending on the users' need. Clay tiles are often white, yellow, orange or brown in color. However, they can be colored or styled according to one’s preference by spraying enamel over the tile once it has been colored before baking it in the kiln. 

These tiles are not only [[eco-friendly]] but also cheap, durable and costs only one third of that of cement. Some of the buildings which are over 100 years old still have tile roofing. 

Clay tiles are most apt for roofing solutions in coastal areas, and in regions that experience heavy rainfall. Clay tiles for a sloping roof offer excellent water proofing in regions where it rains quite often. It is corrosion resistant, and has superior longevity compared to other materials. The Mangalore tiles are generally placed inclined at forty five degrees. The tiles get their robust red colour due to the high proportion of [[Iron#Iron compounds|iron compound]] found in the laterite clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|India: Physical Environment Geography Standard (Grade) IX|2007|p=37|Ref=geo9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tile weighs about {{convert|2|kg|lb}} to {{convert|3|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name="gov"/&gt; These kinds of tiles are most popularly used in [[Kanara|Canara]], [[Goa]], [[Kerala]], and the [[Konkan]].

==Preparation==
First, enough clay is collected, placed in a mold and is precisely cut to measurement. Then, the molded piece of clay with required length and thickness (or shape) is placed on another machine which puts the factory logo and shapes it into a tile.
Then, any extra clay is removed by hand and sent or carried for firing and later glazing. It is heated in a kiln, and the density of the clay tile is determined by the length of time and temperature at which it is heated. 

Clay tiles are often white, yellow, orange or brown in color. However, they can be colored or styled according to one’s preference by spraying enamel over the tile once it has been colored before baking it in the kiln. The extreme heat of the kiln permanently bonds the color and enamel to the tile, ensuring the color does not peel or fade away over time.

It was interesting, to say the least to see how both men and women worked cooperatively to produce the final product. Once fired and glazed, it is ready, and is stored for transport/shipping.&lt;ref name="gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/pp/2005/11/26/stories/2005112601000100.htm|title=Have an imaginative roof over your head |last=Belgaumkar |first=Govind D. |date=2005-11-26|publisher=''[[The Hindu]]''|accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade and commerce==

The '''National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit''' ('''NETCU''') was a [[British police]] organisation funded by, and reporting to, the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] (ACPO) that coordinates police action against groups in the [[United Kingdom]] it describes as [[Extremism|extremist]].

==Structure==
As of April 2007, it was headed by Superintendent [[Steve Pearl]].&lt;ref name=Copping&gt;Copping, Jasper. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/04/15/nalf15.xml "Animal rights extremists target farmers"], ''The Sunday Telegraph'', April 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ACPO is not a public body but rather a [[private limited company]], NETCU is exempt from [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|freedom of information laws]] and other kinds of public [[accountability]], even though they are funded by the [[Home Office]] and deploy police officers from regional forces.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Monbiot|Monbiot, George]].

Retrieved 5 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
"NETCU provides tactical advice and guidance on policing single-issue domestic extremism. The unit also supports companies and other organisations that are the targets of domestic extremism campaigns. NETCU reports through the National Coordinator for Domestic Extremism (NCDE) to the Association of Chief Police Officers Terrorism and Allied Matters - ACPO(TAM) committee."&lt;ref&gt;leaked NETCU policing document, [http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2008/08/405393.html?c=on#comments photos of leaked document]&lt;/ref&gt;

NETCU answers to the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]]' (ACPO) Terrorism and Allied Matters Committee, and in particular to ACPO's [[National Coordinator for Domestic Extremism]], Detective Chief Superintendent Adrian Tudway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netcu.org.uk/media/article.jsp?id=665&amp;chkx=a7f6a8cad72061dcd8101df14763f349 DCS Adrian Tudway appointed new National Coordinator for Domestic Extremism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717001838/http://www.netcu.org.uk/media/article.jsp?id=665&amp;chkx=a7f6a8cad72061dcd8101df14763f349 |date=2011-07-17 }}, NDEU/NETCU, 15 November 2010, accessed 10 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It works with the Home Office, and the National Public Order Intelligence Unit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acpo.police.uk/asp/news/PRDisplay.asp?PR_GUID=%7BCDE00F22-1020-4F1B-BED0-D64A9DE85DCC%7D  "ACPO welcomes 'economic damage' amendment to serious organised crime and police bill"], press release, Association of Chief Police Officers, January 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit was created in or around May 2004 to coordinate police action in relation to [[animal rights]] campaigns. It is based in [[Huntingdon]], Cambridgeshire, which has been a focal point for animal rights activism as a result of the [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netcu.co.uk/contact.jsp NETCU contact page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from animal rights groups, it has also investigated the [[UK Life League]], a [[direct action]] [[pro-life]] group that protests outside abortion clinics.&lt;ref&gt;Laville, Sandra. [http://education.guardian.co.uk/faithschools/story/0,,1740539,00.html "Anti-abortionists turn sights on schools and hospitals in US-style campaign"], ''The Guardian'', March 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- 
==Criticism==
NETCU Watch is a group that monitors and criticizes the activities of NETCU, mainly focusing on their activities against animal rights protesters. &lt;ref&gt;[http://netcu.wordpress.com NETCU Watch]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Takeover by the Metropolitan Police==
In November 2010 it was announced that the three ACPO units commanded by the National Coordinator for Domestic Extremism would be rebranded as the [[National Domestic Extremism Unit]] and brought under the control of the Metropolitan Police by Summer 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressassociation.com/component/pafeeds/2010/11/23/police_on_tightrope_at_protests|title=Police on 'tightrope' at protests|publisher=Press Association|date=23 November 2010|accessdate=2011-01-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224131224/http://www.pressassociation.com/component/pafeeds/2010/11/23/police_on_tightrope_at_protests|archivedate=24 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New START replaced the Treaty of Moscow ([[SORT]]), which was due to expire in December 2012. Its name is a follow-up to the [[START I]] treaty, which expired in December 2009, the proposed [[START II]] treaty, which never entered into force, and the [[START III]] treaty, for which negotiations were never concluded.

Under terms of the treaty, the number of strategic nuclear missile launchers will be reduced by half. A new inspection and verification regime will be established, replacing the SORT mechanism. It does not limit the number of operationally inactive [[nuclear stockpile|stockpiled nuclear warheads]] that remain in the high thousands in both the Russian and American inventories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker |first=Peter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/27/world/europe/27start.html?ref=global-home |title=Twists and Turns on Way to Arms Pact With Russia |work=The New York Times  |date=26 March 2010 |accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''Reuters'' report on February 9, 2017, in US President [[Donald Trump]]'s first 60-minute telephone call with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], Putin inquired about extending New START. President Trump attacked the treaty, claiming that it favored Russia and was "one of several bad deals negotiated by the Obama administration".&lt;ref name="Reuters_T100_New_Start"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-putin-idUSKBN15O2A5 |title=Exclusive: In call with Putin, Trump denounced Obama-era nuclear arms treaty |publisher=Reuters |authors=Jonathan Landay and David Rohde |location=Washington |date=February 9, 2017 |accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Under the terms of the treaty, the number of strategic nuclear missile launchers will be reduced by half. The treaty limits the number of [[Military deployment#Nuclear weapons|deployed]] strategic [[nuclear warhead]]s to 1,550, which is down nearly two-thirds from the original START treaty, as well as 10% lower than the deployed strategic warhead limit of the 2002 Moscow Treaty.&lt;ref name="O'Hanlon" /&gt; The total number of deployed warheads, however, could exceed the 1,550 limit by a few hundred because per bomber only one warhead is counted regardless of how many it actually carries.&lt;ref name="O'Hanlon"&gt;O'Hanlon, Michael E.

The treaty does not cover [[RT-23 Molodets|rail-mobile ICBM launchers]] because neither party currently possesses such systems.

==History==

===Drafting and signature===
The New START treaty is the successor to the [[START I]]. The [[START II]] was signed, but not ratified. The [[START III]] negotiating process was not successful.

The drafting of the treaty commenced in April 2009 immediately after the meeting between the presidents of the two countries, [[Barack Obama]] and [[Dmitry Medvedev]], in London.&lt;ref name="Медведев и Обама решили продолжить сокращение вооружений"&gt;{{cite web | date = 1 April 2009 | url = http://lenta.ru/news/2009/04/01/reset/ | title = Медведев и Обама решили продолжить сокращение вооружений | accessdate =1 September 2009 | language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary talks were already held in Rome on 27 April,&lt;ref name="Начались переговоры между США и Россией о сокращении ядерных вооружений"&gt;{{cite web | date = 27 April 2009 | url = http://lenta.ru/news/2009/04/01/reset/ | title = Начались переговоры между США и Россией о сокращении ядерных вооружений | accessdate =1 September 2009 | language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was originally planned to have them held in the middle of May.&lt;ref name="Россия и США определили дату начала переговоров по СНВ"&gt;{{cite web | date = 24 April 2009 | url = http://lenta.ru/news/2009/04/01/reset/ | title = Россия и США определили дату начала переговоров по СНВ | accessdate =1 September 2009 | language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prolonged talks were conducted by U.S. and Russian delegations, led on the American side by [[U.S. State Department]] Assistant Secretary [[Rose Gottemoeller]]. The Russian delegation was headed by Anatoly Antonov, director of security and disarmament at the Russian [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/27/world/europe/27start.html?pagewanted=all "Twists and Turns on Way to Arms Pact With Russia"], Peter Baker, ''New York Times'', 26 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Presidents Obama and Medvedev announced on 26 March 2010 that they had reached an agreement, and they signed the treaty on 8 April 2010 in [[Prague]].&lt;ref name=Lee /&gt;

===Ratification process===

====United States====
On 13 May, the agreement was submitted by U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] for ratification in the U.S. Senate. Ratification required 67 votes in favor (out of 100 Senators). On Tuesday, 16 September 2010 the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 14–4 in favor of ratifying New START. The measure had support from three Senate Republicans: [[Richard Lugar]] [[List of United States Senators from Indiana|of Indiana]], [[Bob Corker]] of Tennessee, and [[Johnny Isakson]] of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/09/16/senate.start.treaty/ Key Senate committee passes nuclear arms treaty], ''CNN'', 16 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Senator John Kerry&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1210/45870.html John Kerry more optimistic now about START], by Scott Wong &amp; Shira Toeplitz, Politico, 2 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] expressed optimism that a deal on ratification was near.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/254471/clinton-deal-new-start-imminent-daniel-foster Clinton: Deal on New START Imminent], by Daniel Foster, National Review Online, 3 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Republicans in the Senate generally deferred to [[Jon Kyl]] (R-AZ), a leading conservative on defense issues, who sought a strong commitment to modernize U.S. nuclear forces, and questioned whether there was time for ratification during the lame duck session, calling for an opening of the negotiation record before a vote is held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The New Start Treaty: Time for a Careful Look |author=Jon Kyl |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=8 July 2010 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704293604575343360850107760 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Ben Nelson]] (D-NE) joined Kyl in expressing skepticism over the timing of ratification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nelson: 'I Think We Can Hold Off on START' |author=Robert Costa |newspaper=National Review |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/254280/nelson-i-think-we-can-hold-start-robert-costa }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Senator [[Kit Bond]] (R-MO) expressed opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GOP senator cites new intel, won't back New START |author=Eli Lake |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/nov/22/gop-senator-cites-new-intel-wont-back-new-start/ |newspaper=The Washington Times |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama made New START ratification a priority during the 2010 post-election [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] session of Congress, and Senators [[John Kerry]] (D-MA) and [[Richard Lugar]] (R-IN), the Democratic Chairman and senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, were leading supporters of the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How New-START will improve our nation's security |author=John Kerry |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=7 July 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/06/AR2010070603942.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Zimmerman| first = Eric| title = Lugar takes shot at Romney over START| newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]| date = 8 July 2010| url = http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/107787-lugar-takes-shot-at-romney-over-start  | accessdate =10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/2791/lugar-on-new-start-and-tacnukes Lugar on New START and TacNukes], Arms Control Wonk, 8 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2010, the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] gave its advice and consent to ratification of the treaty, by a vote of 71 to 26 on the resolution of ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Memmott |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/12/22/132262684/senate-ratifies-start |title=Senate Ratifies START |publisher=npr.org |date=22 December 2010 |accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen Republican senators, all 56 Democratic senators, and both Independent senators voted for the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/world/europe/23treaty.html?_r=1&amp;hp Senate Passes Arms Control Treaty With Russia, 71-26] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama signed documents completing the U.S. ratification process on 2 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/02/us-usa-russia-start-idUSTRE71177U20110202 |agency=Reuters   | first=Patricia | last=Zengerle | title=Obama signs New START treaty documents | date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====
On 28 May 2010, the document was introduced by Medvedev for consideration in the [[State Duma]]. On 6 July, the State Duma held parliamentary hearings on the treaty, which was attended by representatives from the Foreign Ministry and General Staff. On 8 July, the Duma Defense Committee and the International Affairs Committee recommended that the State Duma ratify the treaty.

However, on 29 October, the chairman of the Duma International Affairs Committee, [[Konstantin Kosachev]], called for the return of the document to committee hearings, noting that the agreement does not restrict the activities of the United States on missile defense, as well as the fact that ballistic missiles with non-nuclear warheads are not covered under the agreement. At the same time, Federation Council Chairman Sergei Mironov proposed not to rush to the amendment, or vote on the treaty, and to monitor the discussions in the U.S. Senate.

Following ratification by the U.S. Senate, the formal first reading of the treaty was held on 24 December and the State Duma voted its approval. The State Duma approved a second reading of the treaty on 14 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/duma_new_start_sent_to_third_reading/2276545.html |title=Duma Sends 'New Start' To Third Reading |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 349 deputies out of 450 voted in favor of ratification.

The third and final reading by the State Duma took place on 25 January 2011 and the ratification resolution was approved by a vote of 350 deputies in favor, 96 against, and one abstention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/politics/adopt-bill-new-start/ |title=Duma adopts bill on ratification of New START — RT |publisher=Rt.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then approved unanimously by the [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]] on the next day.&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian Ratification of Start Follow-on Treaty |publisher=Nukes of Hazzard |url=http://nukesofhazardblog.com/story/2010/5/28/133330/351 |accessdate=22 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106225949/http://nukesofhazardblog.com/story/2010/5/28/133330/351 |archivedate=6 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 January 2011, Medvedev signed the ratification resolution passed by the Federal Assembly, completing the Russian ratification process.&lt;ref name="af.reuters.com"/&gt; The treaty went into force when Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergei Lavrov]] and U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] exchanged the instruments of ratification at the [[Munich Conference on Security Policy|Security Conference]] in Munich, Germany, on 5 February 2011.&lt;ref name="USA Today/The Associated Press"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="af.reuters.com"/&gt;

The [[Heritage Action for America]] advocacy group, an affiliate of the [[Heritage Foundation]], took the lead in opposing New START, lobbying the Senate along with running a petition drive and airing political advertisements before November's midterm elections. The effort drew the support of likely presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]], and has been credited by former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle as changing some Republican votes.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite web |title=US-Russia nuke treaty facing hurdles in US Senate| author=Desmond Butler |date=23 July 2010 |work=The New York Times |url=http://politics.usnews.com/news/articles/2010/07/23/us-russia-nuke-treaty-facing-hurdles-in-us-senate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Heritage Foundation President [[Ed Feulner]], the language of the New START treaty would "definitely" reduce America's nuclear weapon capacity but "wouldn't necessarily" reduce Russia's, and Russia would maintain a 10–1 advantage in [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, which are not counted in the treaty.&lt;ref name=Feulner&gt;{{cite web |title=Stop the New START |author=Ed Feulner |work=The Washington Times |date=9 June 2010 |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jun/9/stop-the-new-start/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arms control experts critical of the treaty included Robert Joseph, former undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, and Eric Edelman, undersecretary of defense for policy, who have written that the treaty weakens U.S. defenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New START: Weakening Our Security |author=Robert Joseph and Eric Edelman |newspaper=National Review |date=10 May 2010 |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/print/229704 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former CIA Director [[James Woolsey]] also said that "concessions to Russian demands make it difficult to support Senate approval of the new treaty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Old Problems with New START |author=R.

Senators [[Jon Kyl]] and [[Mitch McConnell]] complained about a lack of funding for the [[Next-Generation Bomber]] during the treaty debate even though this platform would not be constrained by this treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Kyl, Jon.

The Pentagon's "Report on the Strategic Nuclear Forces of the Russian Federation Pursuant to Section 1240 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012" found that even if Russia did cheat and achieved a total surprise attack with a breakout force, it would have "little to no effect" on U.S. nuclear retaliatory capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kristensen|first=Hans|title=DOD: Strategic Stability Not Threatened Even by Greater Russian Nuclear Forces|url=https://fas.org/blog/ssp/2012/10/strategicstability.php|publisher=Federation of American Scientists|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peer-to-peer file sharing''' is the distribution and sharing of [[digital media]] using [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) networking technology. P2P [[file sharing]] allows users to access media files such as books, music, movies, and games using a P2P software program that searches for other connected computers on a P2P network to locate the desired content.&lt;ref name="Carmack"&gt;{{cite web|last=Carmack |first=Carman|url= http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bittorrent1.htm|title=How Bit Torrent Works|work=computer.howstuffworks.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nodes (peers) of such networks are end-user computers and distribution servers (not required).

Peer-to-peer file sharing technology has evolved through several design stages from the early networks like [[Napster]], which popularized the technology, to the later models like the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] protocol. Microsoft uses it for Update distribution (Windows 10) and online playing games (e.g. the [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|mmorpg]] [[Skyforge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/3dmzhz/heads_up_if_youre_installing_skyforge_the/|title=Heads up if you're installing Skyforge - The downloader is a P2P client and by default starts with Windows. • /r/MMORPG|website=reddit|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;) use it as their content distribution network for downloading large amounts of data without incurring the dramatic costs for bandwidth inherent when providing just a single source.

Several factors contributed to the widespread adoption and facilitation of peer-to-peer file sharing. These included increasing Internet bandwidth, the widespread digitization of physical media, and the increasing capabilities of residential personal computers. Users are able to transfer one or more files from one computer to another across the Internet through various [[file transfer]] systems and other file-sharing networks.&lt;ref name="Carmack" /&gt;

==History==
Peer-to-peer file sharing became popular in with the introduction of [[Napster]], a file sharing application and a set of central servers that linked people who had files with those who requested files. The central index server indexed the users and their shared content. When someone searched for a file, the server searched all available copies of that file and presented them to the user. The files would be transferred directly between the two private computers. A limitation was that only music files could be shared.&lt;ref name="Tyson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tyson|first= Jeff|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/napster2.htm|title=How the Old Napster Worked|work=howstuffworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because this process occurred on a central server, however, Napster was held liable for copyright infringement and shut down in July 2001. It later reopened as a pay service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v11n1/douglas111.html|title= Copyright and Peer-To-Peer Music File Sharing: The Napster Case and the Argument Against Legislative Reform|date= March 2004|work=murdoch.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Napster was shut down, the most popular peer-to-peer services were [[Gnutella]] and [[Kazaa]]. These services also allowed users to download files other than music, such as movies and games.&lt;ref name="Tyson" /&gt;

===Technology evolution ===
[[Napster]] and [[eDonkey2000]], which both used a central server-based model, may be classified as the first generation of P2P systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gong|first1=Yiming|title=Identifying P2P users using traffic analysis|url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/identifying-p2p-users-using-traffic-analysis|publisher=Symantec|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems relied on the operation of the respective central servers, and thus were susceptible to centralized shutdown. The second generation of P2P file sharing encompasses networks like [[Kazaa]], [[Gnutella]] and [[Gnutella2]], which are able to operate without any central servers, eliminated the central vulnerability by connecting users remotely to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Stephanie|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/kazaa3.htm|title=How Kazaa Works|work=computer.howstuffworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third generation of filesharing networks are the so-called [[darknet]]s, including networks like [[Freenet]], which provide user anonymity in addition to the independence from central servers.

The [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] protocol represents a special case. In principle, it is a filesharing protocol of the first generation, relying on central servers called ''trackers'' to coordinate users. However, it does not form a network in the traditional sense. Instead new, separate networks of coordinating users are created for every set of files, called a ''torrent''. Newer extensions of the protocol removes the need of centralized trackers, allow the usage of a decentralized server-independent network for source identification purposes, referred to as the [[Mainline DHT]]. This allows BitTorrent to encompass certain aspects of a filesharing network of the second generation as well. Users create an index file containing the metadata of the files they want to share, and upload the index files to websites where they are shared with others.

Peer-to-peer file sharing is also efficient in terms of cost.&lt;ref name="Babaoglu 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Babaoglu|first=Ozalp|title=Introduction to Peer-to-Peer Systems|url=http://www.cs.unibo.it/babaoglu/courses/cas/slides/p2p.pdf|work=Complex Systems|publisher=Universitá di Bologna|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ijcsits.org/papers/vol3no22013/1vol3no2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The system administration overhead is smaller because the user is the provider and usually the provider is the administrator as well. Hence each network can be monitored by the users themselves. At the same time, large servers sometimes require more storage and this increases the cost since the storage has to be rented or bought exclusively for a server. However, usually peer-to-peer file sharing does not require a [[dedicated server]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winkelman|first=Dr. Roy|title=Software|url=http://fcit.usf.edu/network/chap6/chap6.htm|publisher=Florida Center for Instructional Technology College of Education, University of South Florida,|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic impact ==
{{Main article|File sharing#Economic impact|l1=Effects of file sharing}}
There is still ongoing discussion about the economic impact of P2P file sharing. Norbert Michel, a policy analyst at the [[Heritage Foundation]], said that because of "econometric and data issues, studies thus far have produced disparate estimates of file sharing's impact on album sales."&lt;ref name="heritage.org"&gt;J. Michel, Norbert. [http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/08/internet-file-sharing-the-evidence-so-far-and-what-it-means-for-the-future Internet File Sharing and The Evidence So far], heritage.org, August 23, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''[[The Wealth of Networks]]'', [[Yochai Benkler]] states that peer-to-peer file sharing is economically efficient and that the users pay the full transaction cost and marginal cost of such sharing even if it "throws a monkey wrench into the particular way in which our society has chosen to pay musicians and re-cording executives. This trades off efficiency for longer-term incentive effects for the recording industry. However, it is efficient within the normal meaning of the term in economics in a way that it would not have been had Jack and Jane used subsidized computers or network connections".&lt;ref name="Yochai Benkler"&gt;{{cite book | author = Yochai Benkler | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=McotnvNSjQ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=benkler#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=falsee | title = Wealth of Networks | publisher = Yale University Press | isbn = 0300127235 | date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As peer-to-peer file sharing can be used to exchange files for which the distribution right was granted (e.g. [[public domain]], [[Creative Commons]], [[Copyleft|Copyleft licenses]], online games, updates, ...).

Especially startups can save massive amounts of money compared with other means of [[content delivery network]]s.

A calculation example:

with peer to peer file sharing: &lt;math&gt;\text{total cost} = \frac{\text{filesize}}{\text{customers}} \times \text{cost-per-byte}&lt;/math&gt;

with casual content delivery networks: &lt;math&gt;\text{total cost} = \text{filesize} \times \text{customers} \times \text{cost-per-byte}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Music industry ===
The economic effect of copyright infringement through peer-to-peer file sharing on music revenue has been controversial and difficult to determine. Unofficial studies found that file sharing had a negative impact on record sales.&lt;ref&gt;Alejandro Zentner, [http://www.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1452&amp;amp;context=bejeap "File Sharing and International Sales of Copyrighted Music: An Empirical Analysis with a Panel of Countries"], ''The B.E.

March 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the TERA study entitled "Building a Digital Economy: The Importance of Saving Jobs in the EU's Creative Industries" predicted losses due to piracy reaching as much as 1.2 million jobs and €240 billion in retail revenue by 2015 if the trend continued.  Researchers applied a substitution rate of ten percent to the volume of copyright infringements per year. This rate corresponded to the number of units potentially traded if unlawful file sharing were eliminated and did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffron, Patrice.

== Public perception and usage ==
In 2004, an estimated 70 million people participated in online file sharing.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, Ray. [http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/march17/fileshare-317.html Law professors examine ethical controversies of peer-to-peer file sharing]. ''Stanford Report'', March 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[CBS News]] poll, nearly 70 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds thought file sharing was acceptable in some circumstances and 58 percent of all [[United States|Americans]] who followed the file sharing issue considered it acceptable in at least some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/18/opinion/polls/main573990.shtml Poll: Young Say File Sharing OK] ''CBS News'', Bootie Cosgrove-Mather, 2003-09-18&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, 32 million Americans over the age of 12 had downloaded at least one feature-length movie from the Internet, 80 percent of whom had done so exclusively over P2P. Of the population sampled, 60 percent felt that downloading copyrighted movies off the Internet did not constitute a very serious offense, however 78 percent believed taking a DVD from a store without paying for it constituted a very serious offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srgnet.com/pdf/Movie%20File-Sharing%20Booming%20Release%20Jan%2024%2007%20Final.pdf Solutions Research Group - Movie File-Sharing Booming: Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217011553/http://www.srgnet.com/pdf/Movie%20File-Sharing%20Booming%20Release%20Jan%2024%2007%20Final.pdf |date=2012-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, 20 percent of Europeans used file sharing networks to obtain music, while 10 percent used paid-for digital music services such as [[iTunes Store|iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;17:41 GMT, Thursday, 3 July 2008 18:41 UK.

In February 2009, a [[Tiscali]] UK survey found that 75 percent of the English public polled were aware of what was legal and illegal in relation to file sharing, but there was a divide as to where they felt the legal burden should be placed: 49 percent of people believed P2P companies should be held responsible for illegal file sharing on their networks, 18 percent viewed individual file sharers as the culprits, while 18 percent either didn't know or chose not to answer.&lt;ref&gt;MarkJ - 24 February 2009 (1:46 PM).

According to an earlier poll, 75 percent of young voters in [[Sweden]] (18-20) supported file sharing when presented with the statement: "I think it is OK to download files from the Net, even if it is illegal." Of the respondents, 38 percent said they "adamantly agreed" while 39 percent said they "partly agreed".&lt;ref&gt;TT/Adam Ewing. 8 Jun 06 09:54 CET.

== Communities in P2P file sharing networks==
Communities have a prominent role in many peer to peer networks and applications, such as BitTorrent, Gnutella and [[DC++]]. There are different elements that contribute to the formation, development and the stability of these communities, which include interests, user attributes, cost reduction, user motivation and the dimension of the community.

=== Interest attributes ===
Peer communities are formed on the basis of common interests. For Khambatti, Ryu and Dasgupta common interests can be labelled as attributes "which are used to determine the peer communities in which a particular peer can participate".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-24629-9_5|title = Structuring Peer-to-Peer Networks Using Interest-Based Communities|last = Khambatti|first = Mujtaba|date = 7 September 2003|journal = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume = 2944|pages = 48|doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-24629-9_5|last2 = Ryu|first2 = Kyung Dong|last3 = Partha|first3 = Dasgupta|isbn = 978-3-540-20968-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two ways in which these attributes can be classified: explicit and implicit attributes.

Implicit values means that peers provide information about themselves to a specific community, for example they may express their interest in a subject or their taste in music. With explicit values, users do not directly express information about themselves, albeit, it is still possible to find information about that specific user by uncovering his or her past queries and research carried out in a P2P network. 
Khambatti, Ryu and Dasgupta  divide these interests further into three classes: personal, claimed and group attributes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A full set of attributes (common interests) of a specific peer is defined as personal attributes, and is a collection of information a peer has about him or herself. Peers may decide not to disclose information about themselves to maintain their privacy and online security. It is for this reason that the authors specify that "a subset of...attributes is explicitly claimed public by a peer", and they define such attributes as "claimed attributes".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The third category of interests is group attributes, defined as "location or affiliation oriented" and are needed to form a...basis for communities", an example being the "domain name of an internet connection" which acts as an online location and group identifier for certain users.

=== Cost reduction ===
Cost reduction influences the sharing component of P2P communities. Users who share do so to attempt "to reduce...costs" as made clear by Cunningham, Alexander and Adilov.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://opus.ipfw.edu/econ_facpubs/23/|title = Peer-to-peer file sharing communities|last = Cunningham|first = Brendan|date = 28 October 2003|journal = Information Economics and Policy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 16 December 2015|last2 = Alexander|first2 = Peter|last3 = Adilov|first3 = Nodir}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their work Peer-to-peer file sharing communities, they explain that "the act of sharing is costly since any download from a sharer implies that the sharer is sacrificing bandwidth".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As sharing represents the basis of P2P communities, such as Napster, and without it "the network collapses", users share despite its costs in order to attempt to lower their own costs, particularly those associated with searching, and with the congestion of internet servers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== User motivation and size of community ===
User motivation and the size of the P2P community contribute to its sustainability and activity. In her work Motivating Participation in Peer to Peer Communities, Vassileva studies these two aspects through an experiment carried out in the University of Saskatchewan (Canada), where a P2P application (COMUTELLA) was created and distributed among students. In her view, motivation is "a crucial factor" in encouraging users to participate in an online P2P community, particularly because the "lack of a critical mass of active users" in the form of a community will not allow for a P2P sharing to function properly.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-39173-8_11|title = Motivating Participation in Peer to Peer Communities|last = Vassileva|first = Julita|date = January 2002|journal = Engineering Societies in the Agents World III|volume = 2577|pages = 141|doi = 10.1007/3-540-39173-8_11|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn = 978-3-540-14009-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usefulness is a valued aspect by users when joining a P2P community. The specific P2P system must be perceived as "useful" by the user and must be able to fulfil his or her needs and pursue his or her interests. Consequently, the "size of the community of users defines the level of usefulness" and "the value of the system determines the number of users".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This two way process is defined by Vassileva as a feedback loop, and has allowed for the birth of file-sharing systems like Napster and KaZaA. However, in her research Vassileva has also found that "incentives are needed for the users in the beginning", particularly for motivating and getting users into the habit of staying online.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This can be done, for example, by providing the system with a wide amount of resources or by having an experienced user provide assistance to a less experienced one.

=== User classification ===
Users participating in P2P systems can be classified in different ways. According to Vassileva, users can be classified depending on their participation in the P2P system. There are five types of users to be found: users who create services, users who allow services, users who facilitate search, users who allow communication, users who are uncooperative and free ride.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the first instance, the user creates new resources or services and offers them to the community. In the second, the user provides the community with disk space "to store files for downloads" or with "computing resources" to facilitate a service provided by another users.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the third, the user provides a list of relationships to help other users find specific files or services. In the fourth, the user participates actively in the "protocol of the network", contributing to keeping the network together. In the last situation, the user does not contribute to the network, downloads what he or she needs but goes immediately offline once the service is not needed anymore, thus free-riding on the network and community resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Tracking ==
Corporations continue to combat the use of the internet as a tool to illegally copy and share various files, especially that of copyrighted music. The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) has been active in leading campaigns against infringers. Lawsuits have been launched against individuals as well as programs such as [[Napster]] in order to "protect" copyright owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=f9f5f492-42ef-4892-80d3-e21faab3803c%2540sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=4111|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most recent efforts of the RIAA has been to implant decoy users to monitor the use of copyrighted material from a firsthand perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The P2P war: Someone is monitoring your activities|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128608000091|journal = Computer Networks|date = 2008-04-24|pages = 1272–1280|volume = 52|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.comnet.2008.01.011|first = Anirban|last = Banerjee|first2 = Michalis|last2 = Faloutsos|first3 = Laxmi|last3 = Bhuyan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Congressional hearings before the House Committee of Government Reform (''Overexposed: The Threats to Privacy &amp; Security on File Sharing Networks'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-108hhrg88016/pdf/CHRG-108hhrg88016.pdf|work=Overexposed: The Threats to Privacy &amp; Security on File Sharing Networks|title=Overexposed: The Threats to Privacy &amp; Security on File Sharing Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Senate Judiciary Committee (''The Dark Side of a Bright Idea: Could Personal and National Security Risks Compromise the Potential of P2P File-Sharing Networks?'') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=4f1e0899533f7680e78d03281fed5fb5|work="The Dark Side of a Bright Idea: Could Personal and National Security Risks Compromise the Potential of P2P File-Sharing Networks?"|title=The Dark Side of a Bright Idea: Could Personal and National Security Risks Compromise the Potential of P2P File-Sharing Networks?}}&lt;/ref&gt; were convened to address and discuss the issue of inadvertent sharing on peer-to-peer networks and its consequences to consumer and national security.

Researchers have examined potential security risks including the release of personal information, bundled [[spyware]], and [[Computer virus|viruses]] downloaded from the network.&lt;ref&gt;By M. Eric Johnson, Dan McGuire, Nicholas D. Willey [http://csdl2.computer.org/comp/proceedings/hicss/2008/3075/00/30750383.pdf The Evolution of the Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Industry and the Security Risks for Users]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Where Only Fools Dare to Tread: An Empirical Study on the Prevalence of Zero-day Malware|author=Håvard Vegge, Finn Michael Halvorsen and Rune Walsø Nergård|publisher=2009 Fourth International Conference on Internet Monitoring and Protection|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some proprietary file sharing clients have been known to bundle [[malware]], though [[Open-source software|open source]] programs typically have not. Some open source file sharing packages have even provided integrated anti-virus scanning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turnkeylinux.org/torrentserver Open source file sharing software with integrated anti-virus scanning]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since approximately 2004 the threat of [[identity theft]] had become more prevalent, and in July 2008 there was another inadvertent revealing of vast amounts of personal information through P2P sites. The "names, dates of birth, and [[Social Security number]]s of about 2,000 of (an investment) firm's clients" were exposed, "including [those of] [[Stephen Breyer|Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer]]."&lt;ref name="CNET"/&gt; A drastic increase in inadvertent P2P file sharing of personal and sensitive information became evident in 2009 at the beginning of [[Barack Obama|President Obama]]'s administration when the blueprints to the helicopter [[Marine One]] were made available to the public through a breach in security via a P2P file sharing site. Access to this information has the potential of being detrimental to US security.&lt;ref name="CNET"&gt;Greg Sandoval. April 21, 2009 10:41 AM PDT. [http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10224080-93.html "Congress to probe P2P sites over 'inadvertent sharing'"], ''CNET News''&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, shortly before this security breach, the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show had reported that more than 150,000 tax returns, 25,800 student loan applications and 626,000 credit reports had been inadvertently made available through file sharing.&lt;ref name="CNET"/&gt;

The United States government then attempted to make users more aware of the potential risks involved with P2P file sharing programs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=P2P File-Sharing Risks|publisher=OnGuardOnLine.gov|url=http://www.onguardonline.gov/p2p}}&lt;/ref&gt; through legislation such as H.R. 1319, the Informed P2P User Act, in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Hearing on Barrow P2P Legislation Held on Tuesday|publisher =Congressman John Barrow|date=May 2009|url=http://www.barrow.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=346&amp;Itemid=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this act, it would be mandatory for individuals to be aware of the risks associated with peer-to-peer file sharing before purchasing software with informed consent of the user required prior to use of such programs. In addition, the act would allow users to block and remove P2P file sharing software from their computers at any time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1319 "Text of H.R. 1319: Informed P2P User Act"], ''GovTrack.us''&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Federal Trade Commission]] enforcing regulations.

Nevertheless, in 2010, researchers discovered thousands of documents containing sensitive patient information on popular peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, including insurance details, personally identifying information, physician names and diagnosis codes on more than 28,000 individuals. Many of the documents contained sensitive patient communications, treatment data, medical diagnoses and psychiatric evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;Jaikumar Vijayan.

==Copyright issues==
{{Main article|Legal aspects of file sharing}}
The act of file sharing is not illegal per se and peer-to-peer networks are also used for legitimate purposes. The legal issues in file sharing involve violating the laws of [[copyrighted]] material. Most discussions about the legality of file sharing are implied to be about solely copyright material. Many countries have [[fair use]] exceptions that permit limited use of copyrighted material without acquiring permission from the rights holders. Such documents include commentary, news reporting, research and scholarship. Copyright laws are territorial- they do not extend beyond the territory of a specific state unless that state is a party to an international agreement. Most countries today are parties to at least one such agreement.

In the area of privacy, recent court rulings seem to indicate that there can be no [[expectation of privacy]] in data exposed over peer-to-peer file-sharing networks.  In a 39-page ruling released November 8, 2013, US District Court Judge [[Christina Reiss]] denied the motion to suppress evidence gathered by authorities without a search warrant through an automated peer-to-peer search tool.&lt;ref&gt;ComputerWorld.[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9243970/Don_t_expect_data_on_P2P_networks_to_be_private_judge_rules] " Don't expect data on P2P networks to be private, judge rules".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal law}}

'''Property damage''' (or, in England and Wales '''criminal damage''') is damage to or the destruction of public or private [[property]], caused either by a [[person]] who is not its [[Ownership|owner]] or by natural phenomena. Property damage caused by persons is generally categorized by its cause: neglect (including oversight and [[human error]]), and [[intent (law)|intent]]ional damage. Intentional property damage is often, but not always, [[Malice (legal term)|malicious]]. Property damage caused by natural phenomena may be [[Law|legally]] attributed to a person if that person's neglect allowed for the damage to occur.

== Intention ==
Intentional property damage may be considered a form of [[violence]], albeit one usually (but not always) less reprehensible than violence which does [[bodily harm]] other living beings. For example, allowing a [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]] to fail or a well to become poisoned may qualify as both property damage and lead to bodily harm. On a similar note, certain forms of property damage may prevent bodily harm, such as breaking a piece of machinery that was about to injure a person. Some argue that property damage signals a willingness to do bodily harm or otherwise intimidates the free flow of communication in [[politics|political]] or [[economics|economic]] debates. [[Mohandas Gandhi]] was of this opinion.

== Classification ==
The term [[vandalism]] is often used [[synonym]]ously with intentional property damage, although that term is often associated with superficial or [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] damage, such as [[defacement (vandalism)|defacement]]. When property damage is undertaken for the purpose of intimidating a government or society at large, it may be categorized as [[terrorism]].{{cn|date=September 2016}} In certain contexts, the relations between these terms are inextricably politicized. For example, the [[Earth Liberation Front]] has claimed responsibility for a number of incidents of property damage, but claims to have never harmed a living being, and in fact has a doctrine forbidding members from doing so.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}  However, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] classifies them as a "terrorist" group ostensibly because they send a political and ideological message with this destruction. Meanwhile, the [[United States Department of Defense]] restricts the term "terrorist" to groups that do actual bodily harm.

== Property damage tactics in the labor-, peace- and environmental movements ==
Property damage tactics have been part of the [[labor movement]], [[peace movement]], [[ecology movement]], [[environmental movement]] and [[anti-globalization movement]], among others. The [[infrastructural capital]] of [[logging|loggers]], [[mining|miners]], [[fishing|fishers]], [[suburbia|suburban]] [[housing development|housing developers]], the [[mass media]], employers who are subject to [[strike action]]s, and even police forces have been targeted. The property so targeted, in most cases with the notable exception of labor actions, tends to be that which is deemed to be causing or threatening some form of damage to living beings. Typical examples include [[Greenpeace]] sabotage of bulldozers, peace movement activists entering [[NATO]] bases by breaking fences, and Earth Liberation Front destruction of empty new homes that they deem to be imposing on the Arizona desert [[ecoregion]]

{{property law}}

'''Property law''' is the area of [[law]] that governs the various forms of [[ownership]] and [[tenancy]] in [[real property]] (land as distinct from personal or movable [[possession (law)|possessions]]) and in [[personal property]], within the [[common law]] [[legal system]]. In the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, there is a division between movable and immovable property. Movable property roughly corresponds to personal property, while immovable property corresponds to [[real estate]] or real property, and the associated rights, and obligations thereon.

The concept, idea or [[philosophy]] of [[property]] underlies all property law. In some [[jurisdiction]]s, historically all property was owned by the [[monarch]] and it devolved through [[feudal land tenure]] or other [[feudal]] systems of [[loyalty]] and [[fealty]].

Though the [[Code Napoleon|Napoleonic code]] was among the first [[government]] acts of [[modern history|modern times]] to introduce the notion of absolute ownership into [[statute]], protection of personal property rights was present in [[medieval]] [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]],&lt;ref name=Makdisi-2005&gt;{{Cite book |last=Makdisi |first=John |year=2005 |title=Islamic Property Law: Cases and Materials for Comparative Analysis with the Common Law |publisher=Carolina Academic Press |isbn=1-59460-110-0 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in more [[Feudalism|feudalist]] forms in the common law courts of medieval and early modern England as well

==Theory==
{{globalize|date=January 2013}}
The word ''property'', in everyday usage, refers to an object (or objects) owned by a person — a car, a book, or a cellphone — and the relationship the person has to it.&lt;ref&gt; Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; In law, the concept acquires a more nuanced rendering. Factors to consider include the nature of the object, the relationship between the person and the object, the relationship between a number of people in relation to the object, and how the object is regarded within the prevailing political system. Most broadly and concisely, property in the legal sense refers to the rights of people in or over certain objects or things.&lt;ref&gt;Badenhorst, PJ, Juanita M. Pienaar, and Hanri Mostert. ''Silberberg and Schoeman's The Law of Property''. 5th Edition. Durban: LexisNexis/Butterworths, 2006, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglo-American theory===
[[James Wilson]], [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice and professor of law at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], in 1790 and 1791, undertook a survey of the philosophical grounds of American property law. He proceeds from two premises: “Every crime includes an injury: every injury includes a violation of a right.” (Lectures, III, ii.) The government’s role in protecting property depends upon an idea of right. Wilson traces the history of property in his essay "On the History of Property." In his lecture, "Of the natural rights of individuals" (Lectures II, xii), he articulates related contemporary theory.

That theory was brought to a focus on the question of whether man exists for the sake of government, or government for the sake of man – a distinction which may derive from, or lead to, the question of natural and absolute rights, and whether property is one of them. While he doubts this is so, he nonetheless states: “In his unrelated state, man has a natural right to his property, to his character, to liberty, and to safety.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/of-the-natural-rights-of-individuals/|title=Of the Natural Rights of Individuals {{!}} Teaching American History|website=teachingamericanhistory.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Wilson asks whether “the primary and principal object in the institution of government… was… to acquire new rights by human establishment? Or was it, by a human establishment, to acquire a new security for the possession or the recovery of those rights….?” He indicates a preference for the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XeexAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=%22the+primary+and+principal+object+in+the+institution+of+government%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qmwRz1uBju&amp;sig=bH_5jtBxleMknYf2iyZljPhlG2k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-nsyy7YTaAhVCq1MKHQMJAcAQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20primary%20and%20principal%20object%20in%20the%20institution%20of%20government%22&amp;f=false|title=The Founders on God and Government|last=Dreisbach|first=Daniel L.|last2=Hall|first2=Mark D.|last3=Morrison|first3=Jeffry H.|date=2004-10-08|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9780742580466|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opening sentence of "On the History of Property," he states quite clearly: “Property is the right or lawful power, which a person has to a thing.” He then divides the right into three degrees: possession, the lowest; possession and use; and, possession, use, and disposition – the highest. Further, he states: “Man is intended for action. Useful and skillful industry is the soul of an active life. But industry should have her just reward. That reward is property, for of useful and active industry, property is the natural result.” From this simple reasoning he is able to present the conclusion that exclusive, as opposed to communal property, is to be preferred. Wilson does, however, give a survey of communal property arrangements in history, not only in colonial [[Virginia]] but also ancient [[Sparta]].

Non-legally recognized or documented property rights are known as informal property rights.  These informal property rights are non-codified or documented, but recognized among local residents to varying degrees.

==Priority==

Different parties may claim a competing interest in the same property by mistake or by fraud. For example, the party creating or transferring an interest may have a valid title, but may intentionally or negligently create several interests wholly or partially inconsistent with each other. A court resolves the dispute by adjudicating the priorities of the interests. The term "transfer of property" generally means an act by which a living person conveys property, in present or in future, to one or more other living persons, or to himself and one or more other living persons. To transfer property is to perform such an act.

==Property rights and rights to people==
Property rights are rights over things enforceable against all other persons. By contrast, [[contract]]ual rights are rights enforceable against particular persons. Property rights may, however, arise from a contract; the two systems of rights overlap. In relation to the sale of land, for example, two sets of legal relationships exist alongside one another: the contractual right to sue for damages, and the property right exercisable over the land. More minor property rights may be created by contract, as in the case of [[easements]], [[Covenant (law)|covenants]], and [[equitable servitudes]].

A separate distinction is evident where the rights granted are insufficiently substantial to confer on the nonowner a definable interest or right in the thing. The clearest example of these rights is the [[license]]. In general, even if licenses are created by a binding contract, they do not give rise to property interests.

== Property rights and personal rights ==
Property rights are also distinguished from [[personal rights]]. Practically all contemporary [[societies]] acknowledge this basic [[ontological]] and [[ethic]]al distinction. In the past, groups lacking [[political power]] have often been disqualified from the benefits of property. In an extreme form, this has meant that people have become "objects" of property—legally "things" or [[Personal property|chattels]] (see [[slavery]].) More commonly, marginalized groups have been denied legal rights to own property. These include [[Jews]] in [[England]] and married women in [[Western societies]] until the late 19th century.

The dividing line between personal rights and property rights is not always easy to draw. For instance, is one's [[reputation]] property that can be commercially exploited by affording property rights to it? The question of the proprietary character of personal rights is particularly relevant in the case of rights over human tissue, [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and other body parts.

The rights of women to control their own body have been in some times and some places subordinated to other people's control over their [[fetus]]. For example, government intervention that controls the conditions of birthing by prohibiting or requiring [[caesarian section]]s. Whether and how a woman becomes pregnant or carries a pregnancy to term is also subject to laws mandating or forbidding abortion, or restricting access to birth control. A woman's right to control her body during pregnancy or possible pregnancy – what work she does, what food or substances she ingests, other activities she engages in – have also frequently been subject to restrictions by many other parties; in response, a number of countries have passed laws banning [[pregnancy discrimination]].  [[England|English]] judges have recently made the point that such women lack the right to exclusive control over their own bodies, formerly considered a fundamental [[common law|common-law]] right.{{cn|date=September 2018}} 

In the [[United States]], a "[[quasi-property]]" interest has been explicitly declared in the [[dead body]]. Also in the United States, it has been recognised that people have an alienable proprietary "[[right of publicity]]" over their "persona". The patent/patenting of [[biotechnology|biotechnological]] processes and products based on [[human]] [[genetic material]] may be characterised as creating property in human life.

A particularly difficult question is whether people have rights to [[intellectual property]] developed by others from their [[wikt:body parts|body parts]]. In the pioneering case on this issue, the [[Supreme Court of California]] held in ''[[Moore v. Regents of the University of California]]'' (1990) that individuals do not have such a property right.

== Classification ==
Property law is characterised by a great deal of historical continuity and technical [[terminology]]. The basic distinction in common law systems is between real property (land) and personal property (chattels).

Before the mid-19th century, the principles governing the transfer of real property and personal property on an [[intestacy]] were quite different. Though this dichotomy does not have the same significance anymore, the distinction is still fundamental because of the essential differences between the two categories. An obvious example is the fact that land is immovable, and thus the rules that govern its use must differ. A further reason for the distinction is that legislation is often drafted employing the traditional terminology.

The division of land and chattels has been criticised as being not satisfactory as a basis for categorising the principles of property law since it concentrates attention not on the proprietary interests themselves but on the objects of those interests.&lt;ref&gt;Felix Cohen, "Dialogue on Private Property" (1954) ''Rutgers LR'' 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the case of [[Fixture (property law)|fixtures]], chattels which are affixed to or placed on land may become part of the land.

Real property is generally sub-classified into:
# corporeal hereditaments – tangible real property (land)
# incorporeal hereditaments – intangible real property such as an easement of way

== Possession ==
The concept of [[Possession (law)|possession]] developed from a legal system whose principal concern was to avoid civil disorder. The general principle is that a person in possession of land or goods, even as a wrongdoer, is entitled to take action against anyone interfering with the possession unless the person interfering is able to demonstrate a superior right to do so.

In England, the [[Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977]] has significantly amended the law relating to wrongful interference with goods and abolished some longstanding remedies and doctrines.

== Transfer of property ==
The most common method of acquiring an interest in property is as the result of a consensual transaction with the previous owner, for example, a [[sales|sale]] or a [[gift]]. Dispositions by will may also be regarded as consensual transactions, since the effect of a will is to provide for the distribution of the deceased person's property to nominated beneficiaries. A person may also obtain an interest in property under a [[Trust law|trust]] established for his or her benefit by the owner of the property.

It is also possible for property to pass from one person to another independently of the consent of the property owner. For example, this occurs when a person dies [[intestate]], goes [[bankrupt]], or has the property taken in execution of a court judgment.

== Priority ==
Different parties may claim an interest in property by mistake or [[fraud]], with the claims being inconsistent of each other. For example, the party creating or transferring an interest may have a valid title, but intentionally or negligently creates several interests wholly or partially inconsistent with each other. A court resolves the dispute by adjudicating the priorities of the interests. According to the Indian property law, it define the ‘Transfer of property’ means an act by which a living person conveys property, in present or in future, to one or more other living persons, or to himself and one or more other living persons; and "to transfer property" is to perform such act.

In this section "living person includes a [[company]] or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, but nothing herein contained shall affect any law for the time being in force relating to transfer of property to or by companies, associations or bodies of individuals.

== Lease ==
Historically, [[lease]]s served many purposes, and the regulation varied according to intended purposes and the economic conditions of the time. Leaseholds, for example, were mainly granted for [[agriculture]] until the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, when the growth of cities made the leasehold an important form of landholding in [[urban area]]s.

The modern law of [[landlord]] and [[leasehold estate|tenant]] in common law jurisdictions retains the influence of the common law and, particularly, the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' philosophy that dominated the law of [[contract]] and the law of property in the 19th century. With the growth of [[consumerism]], the law of [[consumer protection]] recognised that common law principles assuming equal bargaining power between parties may cause unfairness. Consequently, reformers have emphasised the need to assess residential tenancy laws in terms of protection they provide to tenants. Legislation to protect tenants is now common.

A '''screener''' ('''SCR''') is an advance screening of a [[film]] or [[television series]] sent to [[critic]]s, awards voters, video stores (for their manager and employees), and other [[film industry]] professionals, including [[Film producer|producers]] and [[distribution (business)|distributors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/terms/screener.cfm ''Screener''] definition at Afterdawn.&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[John Boorman]] is credited with creating the first [[Academy Award|Oscar]] screeners to promote his film ''[[The Emerald Forest]]'' in 1985.&lt;ref name=LosAngelesTimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-oscar-screeners-20180301-story.html |title=The Oscar screener was invented by accident, and other secrets of an awards season staple |last=Miller  |first=Daniel  |date=March 1, 2018  |website=The Los Angeles Times  |publisher= |access-date=March 13, 2018 |quote="The Emerald Forest" didn't get any Oscar nominations — but Boorman's gambit made an impact: He effectively invented the movie screener, now an integral part of Hollywood's awards season apparatus. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screeners help critics and awards voters see smaller movies that do not have the marketing advantage or distribution of major studio releases. Positive mentions can result in awards consideration.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2003-10-14-oscar-dvd_x.htm |title=Screener DVD ban could harm art-house films |first=Andy |last=Seiler |work=USA Today |date=2003-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A screener often has no [[Video post-processing|post-processing]].{{Clarify timeframe|date=March 2016}}&lt;!--"These days, screeners are high-quality DVDs."

==History==
According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Oscar screeners originated with the efforts of director [[John Boorman]] to promote his film ''[[The Emerald Forest]]'', a 1985 [[Powers Boothe]] vehicle about an American child kidnapped by a tribe in the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. The film had been lauded by critics, but due to the business troubles of its distributor, [[Embassy Pictures]], received no advertising campaign. Boorman paid for [[VHS]] copies of the film to be made available to Academy members for no charge at certain [[Los Angeles]] video rental stores. Despite the novelty of his campaign, however, ''Emerald Forest'' received no Oscar nominations.&lt;ref name=LosAngelesTimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-oscar-screeners-20180301-story.html |title=The Oscar screener was invented by accident, and other secrets of an awards season staple |last=Miller  |first=Daniel  |date=March 1, 2018  |website=The Los Angeles Times  |publisher= |access-date=March 13, 2018 |quote="The Emerald Forest" didn't get any Oscar nominations — but Boorman's gambit made an impact: He effectively invented the movie screener, now an integral part of Hollywood's awards season apparatus. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] announced that they would be ceasing distribution of screeners to Academy members, citing fears of [[copyright infringement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2003-10-14-oscar-dvd-side_x.htm |title=What's the big Oscar DVD 'screener' flap? |first=Andy |last=Seiler |work=USA Today |date=2003-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of independent film makers sued and won a decision against the MPAA. The MPAA later reinstated the screeners with the implementation of a new policy requiring recipients to sign a binding contract that they would not share the screeners with others.

In January 2004, Academy member [[Carmine Caridi]] was announced as a ''person of interest'' in an ongoing [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation into [[Warez#Movie piracy|video piracy]]. He was subsequently expelled from the Academy, after he was found to have sent as many as 60 screeners a year for at least three years to a contact called Russell Sprague in [[Illinois]]. Caridi was later ordered to pay [[Warner Bros.]] for copyright infringement of two of their films, ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]'' and ''[[The Last Samurai]]'', a total of $300,000 ($150,000 per title).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/2004/11/Carmine_Caridi_Motion_Picture_Academy_Member_Who_Handed_11-23-2004.php |title=Carmine Caridi, Motion Picture Academy Member Who Handed Over His Awards Screeners for Illegal Duplication, Ordered to Pay $300,000 to Warner Bros.

In March 2016, [[TorrentFreak]] reported that original screener DVDs appear in dozens of [[eBay]] listings.&lt;ref name="TFEbay"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/original-dvd-screeners-widely-available-on-ebay-160326/ |title=Original DVD Screeners Widely Available on eBay |author=andy |date=2016-03-26 |work=[[TorrentFreak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to eBay seller NoHo Trader, the sale of [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] screener DVDs is lawful, although studios occasionally still take down Emmy DVD auctions and other lawful promotional materials.&lt;ref name="ebayguide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebay.com/gds/SHORT-HISTORY-OF-EMMY-SCREENER-DVDs-ON-EBAY-NoHoTrader-/10000000178518206/g.html |title=SHORT HISTORY OF EMMY SCREENER DVDs ON EBAY |author=NoHo Trader&lt;!--http://www.nohotrader.com/ North Hollywood--&gt; |date=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences|Television Academy]] indicates the limited license governing the use of these screeners prohibits further distribution.&lt;ref name="FYC-emmys" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4490">The vast majority of all '''second lien loans''' are [[capital structure|senior]] [[Collateral (finance)|secured]] [[debt|obligations]] of the borrower.  Second lien loans differ from both [[unsecured debt]] and [[subordinated debt]].

==First lien secured loans==
In the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation, the assets used by the company as security would first be provided to the first lien [[secured loan|secured lenders]] as repayment of their borrowings. To the extent that the value of the assets is sufficient to satisfy the company's obligations to the first lien [[secured loan|secured lenders]], any additional proceeds from the sale of the pledged assets would then be made available to the second lien lenders as repayment of the second lien loan.

With almost no exceptions, a borrower will take a second lien loan either at the same time or after taking a traditional first lien [[secured loan]] and the secured lenders will place limitations on the borrower's ability to pledge its assets or borrow additional secured debt.

The specific rights of the first lien and second lien lenders are established in the credit agreements between the borrower and each class of lender as well as in an intercreditor agreement. An intercreditor agreement is a contract between multiple classes of lenders where each class of lender agrees to specific procedures and preferences in the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation. Secured lenders will routinely require an intercreditor agreement to protect their interests before allowing a borrower to obtain a second lien loan.

==Unsecured debt==
Unlike [[unsecured debt]], second lien loans receive a pledge of specific assets of the borrower (e.g., buildings, land, equipment, intellectual property, receivables and other financial assets).

==Subordinated debt==
[[Subordinated debt]] refers to a class of obligations that are contractually subordinated in ranking to all of the [[capital structure|senior]] obligations (i.e., general non-subordinated obligations) of the company, whether they are secured or unsecured. Although the second lien loan's security interest is subordinated to the first lien loan's interest in the pledged assets of the company, the ranking of first lien and second lien loans are the same in the event the pledged assets are not sufficient to satisfy the outstanding borrowings. In the event of a liquidation of a company, both the first lien and second lien loans would likely be repaid in full (along with trade and other general creditors) before the subordinated lenders receive any repayment of their obligations.

== Application in leveraged buyouts ==
Second lien loans are used in [[leveraged buyout]]s to fill small gaps between the financing needs of the borrower and maximum thresholds (measured by various [[leverage (finance)|leverage]] metrics) of [[capital structure|senior]] secured lenders. The arrangement fee and [[interest (finance)]] of a second lien loan are higher than those of the first lien secured loan of the same borrower because of increased risk for the lender that comes from a subordinated security interest.  However, second lien debt can often reduce the overall cost of capital in a leveraged buyout transaction, replacing other more expensive forms of financing (e.g., [[capital structure|senior]] [[unsecured debt]]).

[[File:Jean-Pierre Norblin de La Gourdaine, Sejmik w kościele (1785) - 02.png|266px|thumb|right| ''Sejmik in a church'', by [[Jean-Pierre Norblin de La Gourdaine]] (1745–1830)]]

A '''sejmik''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈsɛjmʲik}}, [[diminutive]] of ''[[sejm]]'', occasionally translated as a ''dietine'';&lt;ref name="Stone2001"/&gt; {{lang-lt|seimelis}}) was one of various local [[parliament]]s in the [[history of Poland]]. The first sejmiks were regional assemblies in the [[Jagiellon Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] (before 1572), though they gained significantly more influence in the later era of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (18th century). Sejmiks arose around the late 14th and early 15th centuries and existed until the end of the Commonwealth in 1795, following the [[partitions of Poland|partitions of the Commonwealth]]. In a limited form, some sejmiks existed in partitioned Poland (1795–1918), and later in the [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918–1939). In modern [[Poland]], since 1999, the term has revived with the ''[[voivodeship sejmik]]s'' (''sejmiki województwa''), referring to the elected councils of each of the 16 [[voivodeships of Poland|voivodeships]].

The competencies of sejmiks varied over time, and there were also geographical differences. Often, numerous different types of sejmiks coexisted in the same governance structure. Almost always presided over by the [[marshal of the sejmik|marshal]], sejmiks could often elect delegates to the national sejm, and sometimes would give such delegates binding instructions. Sejmiks attained the peak of their importance at the turn of the 18th century, when they effectively supplanted the inefficient [[Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth | national sejm]].

==Etymology==
The word sejm and sejmik are derived from [[History of the Czech language|old Czech]] ''sejmovat'', which means "to bring together" or "to summon".&lt;ref name="Davies2005"/&gt;

== History ==
The traditions of a sejmik can be traced to the institution of the [[wiec]] that actually predates the Polish state.&lt;ref name="Kriegseisen1991-17-19"/&gt; They originated from gatherings of nobility, formed for military and consultative purposes.&lt;ref name="Davies2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt; Historians disagree about the specific date of origin of the sejmiks, with some proposed dates being 1374 (the [[Privilege of Koszyce]]) and 1454 (the [[Nieszawa Statutes]]).&lt;ref name="Kriegseisen1991-17"/&gt; Geographically, sejmiks first arose in central Poland ([[Greater Poland]] province).&lt;ref name="Kriegseisen1991-17"/&gt; Over the next century or so, they spread to other provinces of Poland, and finally, by the 16th century, to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].&lt;ref name="Kriegseisen1991-20-25"/&gt; Sejmiks were legally recognized by the 1454 Nieszawa Statutes, in a privilege granted to the [[szlachta]] (Polish nobility) by King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], when the king agreed to consult with the nobility concerning certain decisions.&lt;ref name="Stone2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ertman1997"/&gt; Casimir's recognition of the sejmik stemmed from an attempt to limit the growing power of the [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnates]], and counteract it with the middle nobility.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt;

With the creation of a national [[Sejm]] in 1493, which took over the powers of taxation and the [[pospolite ruszenie]] previously granted to sejmiks at Nieszawa, the importance of regional governance somewhat diminished.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; Still, the sejmikis continued to play an important role in the governance of Poland as the most direct form of political enfranchisement of the nobility.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kriegseisen1991-25"/&gt;

After the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569, the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] had about 70 sejmiks (out of those, 24 were in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]).&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; [[Jacek Jędruch]] notes a trend of an increasing number of sejmiks over time, from about 16 in the 15th century to 104 by the late 18th century, as nobility sought to meet in places that required less travel time.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-39"/&gt; Stanisław Płaza also estimates about 100 at the turn of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Płaza1984"/&gt; Those sejmiks elected 170 deputies (48 from Lithuania).&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; Most sejmiks elected 2 deputies, but there were exceptions.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For a full list of sejmiks and the numbers of deputies elected, see [[Sejm walny#Composition]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kriegseisen1991-35"/&gt; [[Wojciech Kriegseisen]] notes that until the late 18th century, there were 44 sejmiks in Poland proper (the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]]), 24 in Lithuania, and 1 in [[Inflanty Voivodeship|Inflanty]] province.&lt;ref name="Kriegseisen1991-28-35"/&gt;

The sejmik's role grew again in the late 17th century, [[History of Poland (1569–1795)#Decay of the Commonwealth|as central power weakened]].&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt; Sejmiks attained the peak of their importance at the turn of the 18th century, when they often set their own time limits—that is, they extended their authorized periods of operation.&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt; In the face of an inefficient central government, with the national Sejm often disrupted by the [[liberum veto]] and the office of [[starosta]] losing much of its importance, sejmiks administered a portion of the taxes, and raised their own military (''wojsko powiatowe'').&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt; This period, which was known as the "rule of sejmiks" (''rządy sejmikowe''), was brought to an end by acts of the one-day [[Silent Sejm]] (Polish: ''sejm niemy'') of 1717, which removed most taxation and military competences from the sejmiks.&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt; Some sejmiks were also affected by liberum veto until it was abolished for sejmiks in 1766;&lt;ref name="FedorowiczBogucka1982"/&gt; this was not always the case, as some decided to forgo unanimity and move to majority rule.&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt;

Where the middle nobility had been the leading force at the sejmiks in the 16th century, the magnates became increasingly influential in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Lerski1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt; This stemmed from their ability to bribe masses of poorly educated, landless nobility (known as magnate's "clients" or "clientele"), as all nobles were eligible to vote in the sejmiks.&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-173-174"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roszkowski1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt; Sejmiks in Lithuania were dominated by the magnates to a greater extent than those in Poland proper, as the Lithuanian magnates were more powerful than their Polish counterparts.&lt;ref name="Kriegseisen1991-25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madariaga2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Białymstoku1972"/&gt; The magnate-dominated sejmiks, which gathered impoverished nobility, have been described as more concerned with eating and drinking than debate; for the poorest of nobility, they were a rare occasion to participate in feasts sponsored by the magnates.&lt;ref name="Kriegseisen1991-101"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borucki1972"/&gt; When they met, the drunken nobility was known to fight among themselves, which on occasion led to fatalities.&lt;ref name="Borucki1972"/&gt;

Sejmiks were significantly reformed by the ''Prawo o sejmikach'', the act on regional sejms, passed on 24 March 1791 and subsequently recognized as part of the [[Constitution of 3 May]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-178"/&gt; This law introduced major changes to the [[electoral ordinance]], as it reduced the enfranchisement of the noble class.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-173-174"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roszkowski1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt; The voting right became tied to a property qualification; to be eligible to vote, a noble had to own or lease land and pay taxes, or be closely related to another who did.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-173-174"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-178"/&gt; Some 300,000 out of 700,000 otherwise eligible nobles were thus disfranchised, much to their displeasure.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-173-174"/&gt; A document from 1792 lists only 47 sejmiks.&lt;ref name="WredeWrede1999"/&gt;

Although the independent existence of the Commonwealth ended with the [[partitions of Poland]] in 1795, the institution of the sejmik continued, albeit in a somewhat restricted fashion.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-42-43"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-50"/&gt; In the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], sejmiks elected deputies to the [[Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw]].&lt;ref name="bardach351"/&gt; Similarly, sejmiks of [[Congress Poland]] elected deputies to the [[Sejm of Congress Poland]] until its abolishment in 1831.&lt;ref name="bardach364"/&gt; Even in the Lithuanian territories incorporated into the [[Russian Empire]], some judicial sejmiks were allowed to elect lower court judges; it was the only elective representative institution to survive in the Lithuanian territories after the partition.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-42-43"/&gt; In the [[Prussian partition]] there were [[provincial sejmik]]s (Provinziallandtag) and [[powiat sejmik]]s (Kreistag).&lt;ref name="bardach400"/&gt; Near the turn of the century, some limited local representative institutions existed in the [[Russian partition]] and [[Austrian partition]], but they did not bear the name of sejmiks.&lt;ref name="bardach400"/&gt;

After Poland regained independence, provincial sejms were restored in the [[Second Polish Republic]], although they were called sejms rather than sejmiks.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-292-299"/&gt; They included the short-lived [[Sejm of Central Lithuania]] (1921–1922); the three voivodeship sejms ([[Silesian Parliament]], [[Greater Poland Sejm]], and [[Pomeranian Sejm]], 1920–1939), which preserved the tradition of sejmiks in the former Prussian partition; and the [[county sejmik]]s, of which there were 264 in 1939.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-292-299"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bardach532"/&gt; The existence of these institutions was interrupted by the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|occupation of Poland]] during the [[Second World War]], and they were not reestablished in the era of [[communist Poland]].

The sejmiks were revived again after the [[fall of communism]] in modern Poland. Since 1999, the term ''sejmik'' (in full, ''sejmik województwa'') has been used to refer to the elected council of each of the 16 [[voivodeships of Poland|voivodeships]] or regions (see [[voivodeship sejmik]]).&lt;ref name="contract"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Making of Regions in Post-Socialist Europe: the Impact of Culture, Economic Structure, and Institutions"/&gt;  The word ''sejmik'' was chosen by lawmakers in order to eliminate the term ''rada wojewódzka'' ([[voivodeship council]]), which conjured memories of voivodeship people's councils during the [[communist Poland]] era.&lt;ref name="Local Government Reform in Poland: An Insiders Story"/&gt;

==Sejmiks of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth==

=== Features ===
Sejmiks were usually held in a large, open field. The nobility would elect a presiding officer (''marszałek sejmiku'': sejmik marshal), whose role was analogous to the [[marshal of the sejm]] at national Sejms.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; (This term has been revived since 1999, but it now refers to the chairman of the voivodeship executive board rather than the presiding officer of the sejmik itself.) While the sejmiks were originally convened by the king, soon a loophole was exploited: the sejmiks would limit the number of issues discussed, using that as a pretext to reconvene later at a time chosen by the marshal.&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt; Voivodes and starosts also had the ability to convene some sejmiks.&lt;ref name="FedorowiczBogucka1982"/&gt; Until the reforms of the Constitution of 3 May, all the nobility residing in the territory that was holding a sejmik were eligible to participate in the sejmik.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-173-174"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedlar1994"/&gt;

It is estimated that most sejmiks drew around 4 to 6% of eligible participants.&lt;ref name="Leśniewski2008-27"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sławomir Leśniewski|title=Jan Zamoyski – hetman i polityk|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXozFROF9QoC&amp;pg=PA27|date=January 2008|publisher=Bellona|page=27|id=GGKEY:RRA1L0T4Y81|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===
[[File:Norblin - Bojka szlachty na sejmiku (IV).jpg|thumb|Nobility fighting at a sejmik, Jean-Pierre Norblin de La Gourdaine]]
Historians distinguish several types of sejmiks, depending on their geographical scope:
* '''General''' (Polish: ''generalny'', Latin ''conventiones generales''), held in western Poland ([[Greater Poland]]) at [[Koło]], in southern Poland ([[Lesser Poland|Little Poland]]) at [[Nowe Miasto Korczyn]], in [[Masovian Voivodeship|Masovia]] at [[Warsaw]], in [[Ruthenian Voivodeship|Red Ruthenia]] at Sądowa Wisznia ([[Sudova Vyshnia]]), and in [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] at Wołkowysk ([[Vawkavysk]]).&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-43-45"/&gt; The General Sejmiks were composed of delegates elected at the provincial sejmiks, and of Senators.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; Their goal was to agree on a position for the General Sejm ([[Sejm Walny]]) and issue instructions for the deputies on how they were supposed to vote during the General Sejm.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; The competences of the general sejmiks were defined by precedent and custom rather than law; on rare instances when external circumstances prevented a national Sejm from being convened (such as 1511, 1513 and 1577), the general sejmiks were seen as competent to legislate on national matters.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-43-45"/&gt; In the 15th century some general sejmiks reserved the right to accept or reject national legislation.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-43-45"/&gt; In the 16th century they were tasked with preparing drafts of legislation to be discussed at Sejms.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-43-45"/&gt; Around the 17th century general sejmiks were mostly abandoned (with the exceptions of those in [[Royal Prussia]], see [[Prussian estates]]); instead, provincial deputies would meet in special sessions during the Sejm proper.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kriegseisen1991-25-26"/&gt;
* '''Provincial''', '''Territorial''', '''Voivodeship''' or '''County''' (Polish: ''ziemski'', [[Latin]] ''conventiones particulares, conventiones terrestrae''). The names of these sejmiks varied depending on their administrative level and local traditions; Płaza lists [[powiat]] sejmiks (county sejmiks; ''sejmiki powiatowe''), [[ziemia]] sejmiks (territorial sejmiks; ''sejmiki ziemskie''), [[voivodeship]] sejmiks (''sejmiki wojewódzkie'') and provincial sejmiks (''sejmiki prowincjonalne'').&lt;ref name="Płaza1984"/&gt; A theoretical hierarchy that almost never existed in practice could be drawn starting from the powiat sejmiks, and moving upwards to ziemia, voivodeship, general (of several voivodeships) and provincial sejmiks ending with the final, national sejm.&lt;ref name="Płaza1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kriegseisen1991-26-27"/&gt; Almost all ziemias had their own sejmiks, but the importance of the sejmik varied based on whether the given ziemia was autonomous (that is, whether it was part of a voivodeship).&lt;ref name="Płaza1984"/&gt; Powiat sejms were common in Lithuania, but were rare in the Crown of Poland, where instead voivodeship sejms were much more common.&lt;ref name="Płaza1984"/&gt; Some voivodeships could hold a single voivodeship sejmik, and others might be covered by more than one sejmik.&lt;ref name="Płaza1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kriegseisen1991-28"/&gt; The importance of the local sejmiks began to diminish with the formation of the national sejm. Thereafter the local sejmiks were relegated to dealing with local matters and electing deputies to the General Sejms.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; They rose in importance again in the second half of the 17th century, as the central Sejm grew weaker.&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt;

Kriegseisen, quoting [[Adam Lityński]], argues that there was only one type of sejmik and that the only difference between various sejmiks was the purpose for which they were convened.&lt;ref name="Kriegseisen1991-16"/&gt; Nonetheless other scholars often distinguish between different types of sejmiks. [[Juliusz Bardach]] and Jędruch, for example, divide sejmiks based on their purpose as follows:
* '''Pre-sejm''' (Polish: ''przedsejmowe'') sejmiks were convened by the king who sent a [[writ]] (''legacja królewska'') to each sejmik, outlining the reasons the next Sejm would be held.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; Such sejmiks elected one to six deputies (''poslowie''), depending on the size and importance of the sejmik's territory, to the ''ordinary'' General Sejm (Polish: ''Sejm Walny'') that was held every two years, and to any ''extraordinary'' General Sejm that might be called at any time in an emergency.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; Sometimes pre-sejm sejmiks were referred to as electoral. In some cases, a sejmik could be called for two voivodeships – in that case it could elect more than 6 deputies. Deputies were given instructions on how to vote during the sejm proper, although on occasion the instructions could be vague, or even give the deputies full freedom.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; These sejmiks arose in the late 15th century.&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt;
* '''Relational''' or '''Debriefing''' (Polish: ''relacyjne'') sejmiks heard the reports of deputies returned from the General Sejm, usually presenting the law (''konstytucje sejmowe'') decreed by the Sejm.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; They passed specific instructions with regards to the execution of sejm decrees, and other local resolutions.&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-43-45"/&gt; Such sejmiks could also receive special requests from the king; this happened if the sejmik deputy was bound by instructions not to vote on certain issues that subsequently were voted on and passed in the national sejm. In such cases the king would request the sejmik to reconsider their decision and support the national legislation.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; These sejmiks arose in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt;
* '''Electoral''' (Polish: ''elekcyjne'') sejmiks elected higher [[officials in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|voivodeship officials]], judges in particular.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-43-45"/&gt; They were convened irregularly, as such offices were usually held for life.&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; Several candidates would be nominated, and the king would make the final appointment from among them.&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt; These sejmiks arose in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt;
* '''Deputational''' or '''Judicial''' (Polish: ''deputackie'') sejmiks met on a yearly basis and elected deputies (''deputaci'') to [[tribunal]]s ([[Crown Tribunal]] and [[Lithuanian Tribunal]]) from the times of King [[Stefan Batory]] onwards (starting in 1578 in Poland, and from 1581 in Lithuania).&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-43-45"/&gt;
* '''Administrative''' or '''Economic''' (Polish: ''gospodarcze'') sejmiks oversaw voivodeship self-government. Often, they were held on the day following the deputational sejmik. Their decrees were known as ''laudas''. Some of the specific issues that these sejmiks addressed included: dealing with taxation (distribution of national taxes) and tax collectors, managing the local (voivodeship) taxes and treasury, recruiting local military and (from mid-1700s) election of deputies to the Treasury Tribunals. These sejmiks arose in the early 16th century.&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-43-45"/&gt;
* '''Hooded''' (Polish: ''kapturowe'') sejmiks had special powers during an [[interregnum]].&lt;ref name="bardach"/&gt; These sejmiks were organized as [[confederation (Poland)|confederations]], and would elect confederation officials.&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt; The name was derived from hoods worn in the period of royal mourning. These sejmiks began during the interregnum of 1572.&lt;ref name="bardach2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-43-45"/&gt;

==Assessment and historiography==
Kriegseisen notes that the institution of the sejmik gained a negative reputation following the partitions of Poland, and it has been described as one of the dysfunctional elements of the Polish political system that contributed to the fall of the Commonwealth. He cautions against such simplistic assessments, and traces them to 18th century publications whose negative views of the sejmiks have been rarely challenged since. The [[stereotype]] of a group of drunken, fighting nobility, found in some literature, should not be seen as representative, particularly outside the period of the sejmik's decline in the 18th century. He argues that while many sensationalist descriptions of debauchery, brawling or outright bloody violence at sejmiks have survived, they did so because they were just that—sensationalist—and should be seen as exceptions to the long, uneventful, but usually constructive proceedings that were much more common.&lt;ref name="Kriegseisen1991-7-11"/&gt;

Kriegseisen also remarks that there is a myth about the uniqueness of sejmiks to Poland, and notes that similar institutions of self-governance and regional parliamentary participation by nobility can be found in other places, such as in [[Hungary]] and various German provinces ([[Silesia]], [[Prussia]], Brandenburg).&lt;ref name="Kriegseisen1991-7-11"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="993">The '''Seneschal of Normandy''' was an officer carrying out and managing the domestic affairs of the lord of the [[Duchy of Normandy]].  During the course of the twelfth century, the [[seneschal|seneschalship]], also became an office of military command.

The seneschal managed the household, coordinating between the receivers of various landholdings and the chamber, treasury, and the chancellory or chapel.  The seneschals of Normandy, like those appointed in [[Gascony]], [[Poitou]], and [[Anjou]] had custody of demesne fortresses, the regional treasuries, and presidency of the highest court of regional custom.

The '''Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act, 1968''' (Act No. 50 of 1968) was an [[act of Parliament|act]] of the [[Parliament of South Africa]] enacted under the government of [[B. J. Vorster]], which repealed the [[Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951]]. This had the effect of removing the four members of the [[House of Assembly (South Africa)|House of Assembly]] who were elected by [[Coloured]] voters in the [[Cape Province]]. Subsequently the House of Assembly would be elected solely by [[white South African|white]] voters.

The act was promulgated on 5 June 1968, but the repeal only took effect at the dissolution of the House of Assembly on 2 March 1970, before the [[South African general election, 1970|general election of 22 April 1970]]. In the interim, the term of office of the four members was extended and the filling of any vacancy in their seats was prohibited.

In 1969 Coloured citizens were given the right to elect members to the [[Coloured Persons Representative Council]], a quasi-legislative body with limited powers.

The act was repealed by the [[South African Constitution of 1983|Constitution of 1983]], which created the [[House of Representatives (South Africa)|House of Representatives]] to represent Coloured citizens in Parliament.

A '''settlement offer''' or ''' offer to settle''' is a term used to describe an offer to resolve an outstanding issue or account.  The term "settlement offer" may also refer to a statutory offer to compromise in a [[civil action|civil lawsuit]].  In either case, the term is used to describe a communication from one party to the other suggesting a [[settlement (law)|settlement]] - an agreement to fully and finally resolve the outstanding issue, account or dispute.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, offers to settle are governed by Part 36 of the Civil Procedure Rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Procedure Rules, Part 36: Offers to Settle|url=https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part36|website=Ministry of Justice|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Offers of settlement may be called ''[[Calderbank v Calderbank|Calderbank]] Offers'', ''Calderbank Letters&lt;ref&gt;[[Calderbank v Calderbank]] [1975] 3 All ER 333.&lt;/ref&gt;'' and ''Offers of Compromise''.

==United States==
In the US, [[evidence (law)|evidence]] of settlement discussions generally, and of settlement offers specifically, is generally inadmissible in court. This is a policy-based exclusion, intended to encourage the settlement of cases out of court, thus freeing up the resources of the court system. In many jurisdictions, written agreement between the litigants may become binding agreements pursuant to the rules of procedure.

===Arizona===
In Arizona, the Rules of Civil Procedure 80 governs binding settlement agreements in civil court&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=16 A.R.S. Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 80|url=https://govt.westlaw.com/azrules/Document/N54AC1010894511E699029391C09D0CE5?viewType=FullText&amp;originationContext=documenttoc&amp;transitionType=CategoryPageItem&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)|website=Arizona Court Rules|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rule 69 of the Arizona Rules of Family Law Procedure governs binding agreements in family court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=17B A.R.S. Rules Fam.Law Proc., Rule 69, Binding Agreements; Presumption of Validity|url=https://govt.westlaw.com/azrules/Document/N849C9390D61711DF9D628FC4CEFCF5D3?viewType=FullText&amp;originationContext=documenttoc&amp;transitionType=CategoryPageItem&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;bhcp=1|website=Arizona Court Rules|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connecticut===
In Connecticut an offer of compromise is governed by Connecticut General Statute 52-192a. An offer of compromise is a pleading that gets filed with a court to settle a case for a specific amount of money. If the opposing party accepts the offer the case is over. An offer of compromise can first be filed 180 days after the date of service in standard negligence cases and 365 days in medical malpractice cases. An offer of compromise can add a significant amount of money to a case. Interest runs at a rate of 8% over the offer amount and relate back to the date the lawsuit was filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Connecticut General Statutes, Sec. 52-192a. Offer of compromise by plaintiff. Acceptance by defendant. Amount and computation of interest.|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/2015/pub/chap_900.htm#sec_52-192a|website=General Statutes of Connecticut|publisher=Connecticut General Assembly|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida===
In the US state of Florida the offer of a judgment and demand for judgment in negligence-based torts are governed by Title XLV (Torts) Chapter 768 (Negligence): 768.79  "Offer of judgment and demand for judgment". It is also governed by rule 1.442 of the Florida Rules for Civil Procedure "Proposals for Settlement". This process involves making an offer by either party and how the judgment amount affects whether legal fees and costs will be awarded.

==Australia==

Like the United Kingdom, Australia may call settlement offers Calderbank offers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|599|2008|litigants=Kain v Mobbs |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or offers of compromise, pursuant to rule 20.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|NSW|reg|ucpr2005305|Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005|20.26}} Making of offer.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Calderbank offer can be made in writing or orally. Oral offers may create evidentiary issues such that less weight is given to the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|1073|2005|litigants=Gilsan v Optus (No 4) |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An effective offer can be made before action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|242|2008|litigants=Ofria v Cameron (No 2) |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Calderbank Offers and Calderbank Letters often have a major impact on the allocation, by courts, of legal costs between parties.

A '''referendum''' was held in [[Slovenia]] on 25 March 2012 on the [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Slovenia#Family Code 2011|new family code]] passed by the then-governing coalition led by [[Borut Pahor]]. The code was rejected with 54.55% of voters against the law.&lt;ref name="results"/&gt;

==Background==
The [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Slovenia#Family Code 2011|family code bill]] passed by the government of [[Borut Pahor]] which expanded existing same-sex registered partnerships to have all rights of married couples, except adoption (excluding step-child adoption). The law also expanded provisions protecting the rights of children, such as outlawing [[corporal punishment]] and establishing a children's [[ombudsman]]. A conservative group "Civil Initiative for the Family and the Rights of Children", led by the activist and philosopher [[Aleš Primc]] (member of the conservative-centrist [[Slovenian People's Party]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dnevnik.si/clanek/1042511959&lt;/ref&gt; opposed to same-sex unions gathered the required signatures to force a referendum on the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?s=a&amp;id=1722536 Family Law Referendum Signatures Filed], STA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion polls==
A February/March poll carried out by [[Delo]] found that 35.9% of the respondents would vote to uphold the law, while 26.3% said they would vote to repeal it and 20.9% were undecided. The remaining 16.9% of the respondents said they would not attend the referendum. The poll was conducted on 29 February and 1 March among 504 respondents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sloveniatimes.com/the-prospects-of-family-law-referendum The Prospects of Family Law Referendum], Slovenia Times&lt;/ref&gt;

A Ninamedia poll for PlanetSiol.net carried out between 13 and 15 March 2012 found that 47.2% of the respondents would vote to uphold a law, while 40.4% said they would vote to repeal it and 12.4% were undecided. The poll was based on the responses of 700 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siol.net/novice/slovenija/2012/03/anketa_vecina_podpira_druzinski_zakonik.aspx Anketa: Večina podpira družinski zakonik], Planet Siol.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Delo poll conducted between 14 and 20 March among 709 respondents found that 46.9% of the respondents would vote to uphold a law, while 29.2% said they would vote to repeal it and 16.4% were undecided. The remaining 7.5% of the respondents didn't want to respond. Among those who said that they would definitely or probably attend the referendum, 60% said that they would vote to uphold a law while 40% said they would vote to repeal it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://delo.si/novice/slovenija/anketa-dela-za-zakonik-in-jankovica.html Anketa Dela: Za zakonik in Jankovića]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainability standards and certifications''' are voluntary, usually third party-assessed, norms and standards relating to environmental, social, ethical and food safety issues, adopted by companies to demonstrate the performance of their organizations or products in specific areas.  There are perhaps up to 500 such standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and the pace of introduction has increased in the last decade{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.  The trend started in the late 1980s and 90s with the introduction of [[Ecolabel]]s and standards for [[Organic food]] and other products. In recent years, numerous standards have been established and adopted in the food industry in particular{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Most of them refer to the triple bottom line of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Overview article on sustainability standards in the food industry]&lt;/ref&gt; A standard is normally developed by a broad range of stakeholders and experts in a particular sector and includes a set of practices or criteria for how a crop should be sustainable grown or a resource should be ethically harvested. This might cover, for instance, responsible fishing practices that don't endanger marine biodiversity, or respect for human rights and the payment of fair wages on a coffee or tea plantation. Normally sustainability standards are accompanied by a verification process - often referred to as "certification" - to evaluate that an enterprise complies with a standard, as well as a traceability process for certified products to be sold along the supply chain, often resulting in a consumer-facing label. Certification programmes also focus on capacity building and working with partners and other organisations to support smallholders or disadvantaged producers to make the social and environmental improvements needed to meet the standard.

The basic premise of sustainability standards is twofold.  Firstly, they emerged in areas where national and global legislation was weak but where the consumer and [[NGO]] movements around the globe demanded action.  For example, campaigns by Global Exchange&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030618203029/http://www.globalexchange.org/campaigns/sweatshops/nike/ |Global Exchange Campaign - Nike]&lt;/ref&gt; and other NGOs against the purchase of goods from “[[sweatshop]]” factories by the likes of [[Nike, Inc.]], [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]] and other leading brands led to the emergence of social welfare standards like the [[SA8000]] and others.  Secondly, leading brands selling to both consumers and to the [[Business-to-business|B2B]] supply chain may wish to demonstrate the environmental or organic merits of their products, which has led to the emergence of hundreds of ecolabels{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, organic and other standards.  A leading example of a consumer standard is the [[Fairtrade]] movement, administered by [[FLO International]] and exhibiting huge sales growth around the world for ethically sourced produce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx Fairtrade Growth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225094221/http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx |date=2010-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a [[Business-to-business|B2B]] standard which has grown tremendously in the last few years is the [[Forest Stewardship Council]]’s standard (FSC) for forest products made from sustainable harvested trees.

However, the line between consumer and B2B sustainability standards is becoming blurred, with leading trade buyers increasingly demanding Fairtrade certification, for example, and consumers increasingly recognizing the FSC mark. In recent years, the business-to-business focus of sustainability standards has risen as it has become clear that consumer demand alone cannot drive the transformation of major sectors and industries{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. In commodities such as palm oil, soy, farmed seafood, and sugar, certification initiatives are targeting the mainstream adoption of better practices and [[precompetitive]] industry collaboration. Major brands and retailers are also starting to make commitments to certification in their whole supply chain or product offering, rather than a single product line or ingredient{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} .

With the growth of standards and certification as the major tool for global production and trade to become more sustainable and for the private sector to demonstrate sustainability leadership, it is essential that there are ways to assess the legitimacy and performance of different initiatives. Company and government buyers, as well as NGOs and civil society groups committed to sustainable production, need clarity on which standards and ecolabels are delivering ''real'' social, environmental and economic results. The [[ISEAL Alliance]] has emerged as the authority on good practice for sustainability standards and its Codes of Good Practice represent the most widely recognised guidance on how standards should be set up and implemented in order to be effective{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. By complying with these Codes and working with other certification initiatives, ISEAL members demonstrate their credibility and work towards improving their positive impacts.

Attempts to address the problems caused by a multiplicity of certification initiatives led to the launch of [[State of Sustainability Initiatives|The State of Sustainability Initiatives (SSI)]] project, facilitated by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) and the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] (IISD) under the auspices of the Sustainable Commodity Initiative (SCI){{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

== Origin of global standards ==

''Most'' sustainability standards that are being adopted today were initiated by [[social movements]] in particular countries, such as Rainforest Alliance in the United States and Fairtrade in the Netherlands{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards were initiated by individual companies, such as [[UTZ Certified|Utz Certified]] (Ahold), Starbucks C.A.F.E. (Starbucks), and Nespresso AAA (Nespresso). Some standards were launched by coalitions of private firms, development agencies, NGOs, and other stakeholders. For example, the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C) was initiated by an alliance of large American coffee roasters, including [[Kraft Foods]], [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]] and [[Nestle]], assisted by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development ([[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]]). One important facilitator for the development of most global standards were series of local development projects involving NGOs, coffee roasters and producers in different developing countries. For example, the Fairtrade standard was developed based on pilot projects with Mexican farmers. 4C builds on development projects in Peru, Colombia and Vietnam, involving GIZ, major coffee roasters, and local producers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1668888 Article on the Development of the Common Code for the Coffee Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely established and adopted standards are in agriculture, with 40% of global coffee production certified to one of the main schemes, and approximately 15-20% of cocoa and tea production being compliant with major international standards. Forestry and wild seafood are also sectors in which standards have been influential, with certified production pushing past 10% of the global share. Cotton, palm oil, soy, biofuels and farmed seafood are some of the commodities in which certification is growing the fastest, due in part to major roundtables that have been set up to bring the whole industry together. More recently, standards have started to emerge for mining and the extraction of metals - including gold, silver, aluminium, and oil and gas - as well as for cattle, electronics, plastics and tourism.

Evidence suggests that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) adopted willingly by firms will be much more effective than government regulated CSR so global standards by private companies show promise for effective social impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J. Scott|last2=Green|first2=Kesten C.|title=Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=2013|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43007/1/MPRA_paper_43007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[ISEAL Alliance]] in 2002 was the first collaborative effort amongst a group of sustainability standards organisations to agree to follow common good practices in how their standards are implemented and also to work together to drive up the use of standards and certification globally.

== Different sustainability standards ==
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}

Numerous sustainability standards have been developed in recent years to address issues of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity of global production and trade practices. Despite similarities in major goals and certification procedures, there are some significant differences in terms of their historical development, target groups of adopters, geographical diffusion, and emphasis on environmental, social or economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Introduction to different standards]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major differences to be aware of is based on the level of strictness of the standard. Some standards set the bar high for a sector, promoting the strongest social and environmental practices and working with the top performers to constantly push up sustainability expectations{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards are more focused on the elimination of the worst practices and operate at more of an entry-level to get a large proportion of an industry working incrementally towards better practices. Often times there are strategies between standards to move producers along this performance ladder of sustainability{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Another important distinction is that some standards can be applied internationally (usually with mechanisms to ensure local relevance and appropriateness) whereas other standards are developed entirely with a regional or national focus{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

Additional differences between standards might relate to the certification process and whether it is conducted by a first, second or third party; the traceability system in place and whether it allows for the segregation or mixing of certified and non-certified materials; and the types of sustainability claims that are made on products.

=== Fairtrade ===

The [[Fairtrade]] label was developed in the late 1980s by a Dutch development agency in collaboration with Mexican farmers{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The initiative performs [[development work]] and promotes its political vision of an [[alternative economy]], seeing its main objective in empowering small producers and providing these with access to and improving their position on global markets{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The ''most distinguishing'' feature of the Fairtrade label is the guarantee of a minimum price and a [[social premium]] that goes to the cooperative and not to the producers directly. Recently{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, Fairtrade also adopted environmental objectives as part of their certification system.

=== Rainforest Alliance ===
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}
The [[Rainforest Alliance]] was created in the late 1980s from a social movement and is committed to conserving rainforests and their biodiversity. One key element of the standard is the compulsory elaboration and implementation of a detailed plan for the development of a sustainable farm management system to assist wildlife conservation. Another objective is to improve workers’ welfare by establishing and securing ''sustainable'' livelihoods. Producer prices may carry a premium. Yet instead of guaranteeing a fixed [[floor price]], the standard seeks to improve the economic situation of producers through higher yields and enhanced cost efficiency{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== Utz Certified ===

[[UTZ Certified]] (formerly Utz Kapeh) was co-founded by the Dutch coffee roaster [[Ahold Coffee Company]] in 1997. It aims to create an open and transparent marketplace for socially and environmentally responsible agricultural products. ''Instruments'' include the UTZ Traceability System and the UTZ Code of Conduct. The traceability system makes certified products traceable from producer to final buyer and has ''stringent'' chains of custody requirements. The UTZ Code of Conduct emphasizes both environmental practices (e.g. biodiversity conservation, waste handling and water use) and social benefits (e.g. access to medical care, access to sanitary facilities at work).

=== Organic ===
The [[Organic farming|Organic]] standard was developed in the 1970s and is based on [[IFOAM]] Basic Standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. IFOAM stands for International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements and is the leading global umbrella organization for the organic farming movement. The IFOAM Basic Standards provide a framework of minimum requirements, including the omission of agrochemicals such as pesticides and chemical-synthetic fertilizers. The use of animal feeds is also strictly regulated. Genetic engineering and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are forbidden{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== trustea ===

The [http://www.trustea.org trustea code] is designed to evaluate the social, economic, [[agronomic]] and environmental performance of Indian tea estates, smallholders and Bought Leaf Factories (BLFs).

It is expected that the compliance with the code not only improves competitiveness of the tea farms but also facilitates the tea farms in achieving compliance with national regulations and international sustainability standards in a step-wise approach. The applicable control points under eleven chapters are required to be adhered to within a four-year period. The India tea code allows producers to show that they operate responsibly– producing quality tea according to strict social and environmental standards. The verification under the code provides manufacturers with the assurance of responsible production and provides opportunities to credibly demonstrate this to their customers.

=== SuRe® – The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure ===

SuRe® is a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of resilience and sustainability into infrastructure development, through various criteria across governance, social and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gib-foundation.org/sure-standard/&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently developed under ISEAL guidelines by the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) and the French bank [[Natixis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges-africa/news/sustainable-trade-infrastructure-in-africa-a-key-element-for-growth&lt;/ref&gt; GIB and Natixis launched the SuRe® standard at a [[COP21]] event on 9 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greeneconomycoalition.org/updates/gib-launches-sure%C2%AE-standard-cop21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===
Other types of standards include sector-specific schemes such as the [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]] (RSPO); standards for climate and development interventions like the Gold Standard, retailer-led sustainability certification initiatives such as [[GlobalGAP]];
Corporate own-brand sustainability initiatives such as [[Starbucks#Coffee and Farmer Equity .28C.A.F.E..29 practices|Starbucks' CAFE Practices]]; and national programmes such as the [[Bord Bia|Irish Food Board]]'s 'Origin Green' scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Topics/Product-differentiation/Special-report-Implications-of-sustainability-certification-schemes-for-the-ACP ''Agritrade'': Implications of sustainability certification schemes for the ACP] 16 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards]] (UNFSS) is a joint initiative of FAO, UNEP, ITC, UNCTAD, and UNIDO on Sustainability Standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards|url=https://unfss.org|website=UNFSS|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taxation of costs''' is a [[ministerial function]] performed by a [[court]] upon the resolution of case. It involves entering the various costs and their amounts against the party (either the [[claimant]] or [[defendant]]) against whom those costs have been awarded by the court. The [[itemisation]] of costs or the subsequent determination of the costs that should be allowed is not a determination of the outcome of the [[litigation]].

This is now known as [[detailed assessment]] in English law following the [[Civil Procedure Act 1997]].

In early [[common law]] costs were unknown, but as early as 1278 [[Statute of Gloucester|an English statute was passed]] whereby costs could be awarded to the prevailing party (''Brown v. Consolidated Fisheries Co.,'' 18 F.R.D. 433).

Such costs can include items such as [[witness]] fees, mileage and subsistence, marshal's fees, [[attorney's fees|attorney's]] and other docket fees, and a [[court reporter|reporter's]] charge for [[transcript (law)|transcript]].

A [[trademark]] is a word, phrase, or logo that identifies the source of goods or services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/trademarks/en/|title=Trademarks|website=www.wipo.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trademark law protects a business' commercial identity or [[brand]] by discouraging other businesses from adopting a name or logo that is "confusingly similar" to an existing trademark. The goal is to allow consumers to easily identify the producers of goods and services and avoid confusion.&lt;ref name=harvard&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tm.htm#toc|title=Overview of Trademark Law|website=cyber.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United States trademark law''' is mainly governed by the [[Lanham Act]]. Common law trademark rights are acquired automatically when a business uses a name or logo in commerce, and are enforceable in state courts. Marks registered with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|  U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] are given a higher degree of protection in federal courts than unregistered marks—both registered and unregistered trademarks are granted some degree of federal protection under the Lanham Act 43(a).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tm.htm#2|title=Overview of Trademark Law|website=cyber.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of U.S. trademark law==
[[United States]] law has protected trademarks under state [[common law]] since colonial times, but it was not until 1870 that [[United States Congress|Congress]] first attempted to [[Unconstitutional trademark acts|establish a federal trademark regime]]. This 1870 statute was purported to be an exercise of Congress' [[Copyright Clause]] powers, however, the Supreme Court struck down the 1870 statute in the ''[[Trade-Mark Cases]].'' In 1881, Congress passed a new trademark act, this time pursuant to its [[Commerce Clause]] powers. Congress revised the Trademark Act in 1905.

In 1946, Congress passed the [[Lanham Act]] ({{UnitedStatesCode|15|1051|1127}}). The Lanham Act defines federal trademark protection and trademark registration rules. The Lanham Act grants the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] ("USPTO") administrative authority over trademark registration.

State law continues to add its own protection, complementing (and complicating) the federal trademark system.

Recent developments in U.S. trademark law have included the adoption of the [[Federal Trademark Dilution Act]] of 1995 (see [[Trademark dilution]]), the 1999 [[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]], and the [[Trademark Dilution Revision Act]] of 2006 (see [[Trademark dilution]]).

==Purpose of U.S. Trademark Law==
Trademark law protects a company's goodwill, and helps consumers easily identify the source of the things they purchase. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In principle, trademark law, by preventing others from copying a source-identifying mark, reduces the customer's costs of shopping and making purchasing decisions, for it quickly and easily assures a potential customer that this item—the item with this mark—is made by the same producer as other similarly marked items that he or she liked (or disliked) in the past. At the same time, the law helps assure a producer that it (and not an imitating competitor) will reap the financial, reputation-related rewards associated with a desirable product. The law thereby encourages the production of quality products and simultaneously discourages those who hope to sell inferior products by capitalizing on a consumer's inability quickly to evaluate the quality of an item offered for sale.&lt;ref name=qualitex /&gt; [internal punctuation omitted]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Symbols==
U.S. Trademark rights come in two types: [[common law]] and federal registration.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;[[Trademark symbol|™]]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; – Signifies common law trademark rights. Businesses automatically receive common law trademark rights by using a brand name or logo in the normal course of commerce.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;[[Registered trademark symbol|®]]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; – Signifies a registered trademark. The ® symbol may only be used on a trademark that has been examined, approved and ''registered'' with the [[USPTO]].

==Acquiring trademark rights==
Trademark rights are acquired through use of a mark in the normal course of commerce.  For example, by using a brand name or logo on a product or its retail packaging.

===Things that can qualify as a trademark===
A word, phrase, or logo can act as a trademark. But so can a slogan, a name, a scent, the shape of a product's container, and a series of musical notes.&lt;ref name=qualitex /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The language of the [[Lanham Act]] describes that universe [of things that can qualify as a trademark] in the broadest of terms. It says that trademarks "includ[e] any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof." § 1127. Since human beings might use as a "symbol" or "device" almost anything at all that is capable of carrying meaning, this language, read literally, is not restrictive. The courts and the Patent and Trademark Office have authorized for use as a mark a particular shape (of a [[Contour bottle|Coca-Cola bottle]]), a particular sound (of [[NBC chimes|NBC's three chimes]]), and even a particular scent (of plumeria blossoms on sewing thread).&lt;ref name=qualitex /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Strength of trademarks===
{{main|Trademark distinctiveness}}
Some trademarks afford more potent rights than others. The closer the relationship between the mark and the goods, the weaker the mark. Trademarks are often separated into 4 categories of distinctiveness:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World]]'' 537 F.2d 4 (2nd Cir. 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Arbitrary and Fanciful  (strongest)
* Suggestive  (medium)
* Descriptive  (weak)
* Generic  (no protection)

====Arbitrary and Fanciful====
Where there is no logical relationship between the mark and the goods or services, trademark protection is at its strongest. Arbitrary and fanciful marks are considered inherently distinctive and are prima facia registrable. For example, ''coined words'' – such as [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]], [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]], or [[Starbucks]] – are considered fanciful and receive strong trademark protection. Arbitrary marks include preexisting words used in an arbitrary way, such as "Apple" when [[Apple, Inc.|used for computers]].

====Suggestive====
Suggestive trademarks are still broadly protected. These marks "suggest" something about the product or services they are used on.  The suggestion is a subtle connotation, not an outright description of the product. An example is "Whirlpool" [[Whirlpool Corporation|for washing machines]].

====Descriptive====
Descriptive terms immediately describe the goods, or some important characteristic of the goods. Trademark law does not protect descriptive terms unless achieve "secondary meaning" in the minds of consumers. That is,  trademark rights accrue when the public comes to associate the descriptive term with a ''particular company'' rather than the ''product in general''.

====Generic====
The [[generic term]] for a product or service cannot be trademarked.  Granting trademark rights on a generic term-say "apple" for use on apple juice-puts other companies at an unfair competitive disadvantage.  Every company has the right to describe its products and services using generic terms.

== Trademark registration==
[[File:US Trademark Registration for Apple Computer Logo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Registration for Apple Computer Logo]]
Once acquired, trademark rights may be registered with the [[USPTO]]. "The [[Lanham Act]] gives a seller or producer the exclusive right to "register" a trademark, 15 U.S.C. § 1052, and to prevent his or her competitors from using that trademark, § 1114(1)."&lt;ref name=qualitex&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Qualitex v. Jacobson Products |vol=514 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=159 |pinpoint= |court=Supreme Court |date=1995 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17905304466595211702&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,33 |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of Federal trademark registration===
Trademark protection depends on use in commerce, not registration. Both registered and non-registered trademarks are both eligible for protection under the [[Lanham Act]].  However, registration (on the "Principal Register") affords several advantages: 
* Nationwide trademark rights
* A registered mark is presumed to be a valid trademark
* The owner listed on the registration is presumed to be the true owner of the trademark rights
* Presumption that the mark has not been "abandoned" through non-use
* Access to Federal Courts for litigating trademark infringement
* "Incontestability." After five years of unopposed registration, a trademark is eligible to become "incontestable."  An incontestable mark cannot be attacked on the grounds that it is "merely descriptive."
* [[Constructive notice]] – that is, infringers cannot claim that they were unaware of a registered trademark
* Enhanced remedies for infringement, including the possibility of triple damages and criminal penalties for counterfeiting (note that counterfeiting is a more culpable type of infringement)
* Right to have the U.S. Customs Service prevent others from importing goods bearing infringing marks

===Process of application for Federal trademark registration===
Trademarks may be registered online.  The USPTO charges a $275 fee for online trademark applications. The process takes about 6 months from initial application to final registration. It is a general practice to hire a trademark lawyer to file the application on behalf of the future owner.

Once the application is filed, it sits in a queue for a few months. Eventually, a [[USPTO]] Trademark Examiner will examine the application according to the rules of the [[Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure]]. If the Trademark Examiner identifies problems with the applications, the applicant will be sent a "preliminary rejection." The applicant will then have 6 months to file a reply with arguments in favor of her trademark application. If the Trademark Examiner is persuaded by the reply arguments, the application will be granted registration. If not, a "final rejection" will be issued.

When an application is allowed, it moves on to "publication" in the ''[[Trademark Official Gazette]]''.  Once published, there is a 30-day opportunity for other companies to appeal the registration. If no appeal is filed, the registration is finally issued.

If the registration receives a final rejection from the Trademark Examiner, the applicant may appeal the rejection to the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]]. Likewise, if the application is opposed by a third party, the appeal will be reviewed by the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]].

===Actual use vs. intent to use===
An application for registration may be based upon "actual use" in commerce (a §1(a) registration) or upon a ''[[bona fide]]'' intent to use ("ITU") the mark in commerce (§1(b) registration). An ITU application is a placeholder. It will not be allowed to register until the applicant actually begins using the mark in [[interstate commerce]]. The value of ITU is in establishing ''priority''—that is, determining which business first acquired the trademark rights.

===Primary Register and Supplemental Register===
The benefits of federal trademark registration only accrue to marks listed on the "Primary Register". To be eligible for the Principal Register, a mark must be recognized as a trademark, and not just a description of some goods or services. Eligible marks include (a) arbitrary or fanciful marks, (b) "suggestive" marks, and (c) descriptive marks that have achieved "secondary meaning" or "distinctiveness."

The Supplemental Register is for "descriptive" marks that have not yet become distinctive. Descriptive marks describe some quality of the goods or services they are used with. Descriptive marks may become distinctive (acquire "secondary meaning") through 5 years of use in commerce, or through evidence of heavy advertising and market recognition.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Secondary meaning is acquired when in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a product feature... is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself.&lt;ref name=qualitex/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that "generic" terms are ineligible for trademark protection altogether, and may not be registered on either the Primary or Supplemental Registers.

===State trademark registration===
Trademarks may also be registered at the state level. State registrations are less potent than federal trademark registration. But federal registration requires use of the mark in [[interstate commerce]]. If a mark is only used in one particular state, registration at the [[U.S. state|state]] level may be appropriate. State trademark registration is usually by filing an application with the [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]] of the relevant state.

==Infringement: likelihood of confusion test==
Trademark infringement is measured by the so-called "likelihood of confusion" test. A new trademark will infringe on an existing one if the new one is so similar to the original that consumers are likely to confuse the two marks, and mistakenly purchase from the wrong company.&lt;ref name=polaroid&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Polaroid v. Polarad |vol=287 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=492 |pinpoint= |court=2nd Cir. |date=1961 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Polaroid+Corporation+v.+Polarad+Electronics&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,60,107,112,114,122,127,129&amp;case=2293827617926067028&amp;scilh=0 |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The likelihood of confusion test turns on several factors,&lt;ref name=polaroid /&gt; including:

* Strength of the plaintiff's trademark
* Degree of similarity between the two marks at issue
* Similarity of the goods and services at issue
* Evidence of actual confusion
* Purchaser sophistication
* Quality of the defendant's goods or services
* Whether the defendant's attempt to register the trademark was [[bona fide]] (''in good faith'').

This multi-factor test was articulated by Judge [[Henry Friendly]] in ''Polaroid v. Polarad''.&lt;ref name=polaroid /&gt; and are often referred to as the "Polaroid Factors".

Note that other factors may also be considered in determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists. "Even this extensive catalogue does not exhaust the possibilities—the court may have to take still other variables into account."&lt;ref name="polaroid"/&gt;

==Limits on trademark law==
Consistent with the limited nature of trademark protection and the [[free speech]] guarantees of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], U.S. law provides for a [[Fair use (US trademark law)|fair use]] defense to trademark infringement.  Fair use in trademark law does not employ the same four-pronged analysis used in [[copyright law of the United States|copyright law]]. The law recognizes two fair use defenses: classic fair use, where the alleged infringer is using the mark to describe accurately an aspect of its products;&lt;ref&gt;''KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc.'', 543 U.S. 111 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nominative fair use]], in which the trademark is being used to actually refer to the trademarked product or trademark owner.

These uses are still subject to the requirement that there be no [[consumer confusion]] as to source or sponsorship.  Trademarks may also be lawfully used in [[parody|parodies]], since in that case there is usually no likelihood of confusion.

== Trademark compared to other intellectual property laws==
In contrast to copyright or [[patent]] law, trademark protection does not have a set duration or definite expiration date. Trademark rights only expire when the owner stops using the mark in commerce.  However, federal trademark registrations expire ten years after the registration date, unless renewed within one year prior to the expiration.

The U.S. Constitution specifically grants Congress power over copyright and patent law, but not over trademark law. Instead, Congress' power to create federal trademark law is derived from the Commerce Clause. Therefore, there must be some degree of [[interstate commerce]] present for a trademark to receive [[Lanham Act]] protection.  The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] invalidated the first federal trademark law by finding that Congress could not stretch the [[Copyright Clause]] to cover trademarks,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Trade-Mark Cases]]'', {{ussc|100|82|1879}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[copyright]] law which provides for criminal penalties as well as civil damages, trademark law in the [[United States]] is almost entirely enforced through private [[lawsuit]]s. The exception is in the case of criminal [[Counterfeit#Counterfeiting of consumer goods|counterfeiting]] of goods. Otherwise, the responsibility is entirely on the mark owner to file suit in either state or federal civil court in order to restrict an infringing use.  Failure to "police" a mark by stopping infringing uses can result in the loss of protection.

The '''Virginia School''' of [[political economy]] is a [[schools of economics|school of economic thought]] originating in universities of [[Virginia]] ([[University of Virginia]], [[Virginia Tech]], and [[George Mason University]]) in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly focusing on [[public choice]] theory, [[constitutional economics]], and [[law and economics]].

== Development ==
It emerged first at the Thomas Jefferson Center at the [[University of Virginia]] established by [[James M. Buchanan]] and [[G. Warren Nutter]] in 1957.  It was there that [[Ronald Coase]] formulated his famous [[Coase theorem|theorem]] on [[The Problem of Social Cost|the problem of social cost]] (1960) and that Buchanan and [[Gordon Tullock]] wrote&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Tullock, 2004. ''Virginia Political Economy'', C. K. Rowley, ed. Liberty Fund.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Calculus of Consent]]: Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy'' (1962).

In 1969, Buchanan,  Tullock, and Charles J. Goetz established the Center for the Study of Public Choice at [[Virginia Tech]], which moved with them to  [[George Mason University]] in 1983. Other prominent scholars associated with the school include [[Dennis C. Mueller]], [[Robert D. Tollison]], [[Andrew B. Whinston]], and [[Leland B. Yeager]].&lt;ref&gt;• Charles K. Rowley and Michelle A. Vachris, 1996. F. E. Foldvary, ed., ''Beyond Neoclassical Economics: Heterdox Approaches to Economic Theory'', Edward Elgar.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • William Breit, 1987. "Creating the 'Virginia school': Charlottesville as an Academic Environment in the 1960s," ''Economic Inquiry'', 25(4), pp. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-7295.1987.tb00766.x/abstract 645]–657.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • James M. Buchanan, 2006, "The Virginia Renaissance in Political Economy: The 1960s Revisited," in ''Money and Markets: Essays in Honor of Leland B. Yeager'', Roger Koppl, ed., pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QHVJiWrPsjEC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=false&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 34–44].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic approach ==
The Virginia approach to political economy focuses on comparing private and public sector institutions as imperfect alternatives. The Virginia approach is also favored by some economists of the [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago]] and [[Austrian School|Austrian]] schools. Virginia School economists are often seen as 'fellow travelers' with Austrian economists, as members of both schools of economic thought generally favor free-market outcomes.

There are several main lines of research in the Virginia School. James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock were among the earliest economists to apply economic analysis to national constitutions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Tullock also founded the modern [[rent seeking]] literature. [[Mancur Olson]] founded modern research on [[collective action]] and special interest groups. Olson was not at GMU, Virginia, or Virginia Tech, but Virginia scholars tend to emphasize special interest group bias in government.

However the Virginia School is opposed to the Chicago school of political economy on two fundamental points. Chicago believes that politics tends towards efficiency due to the fact that human predators provoke stiffening resistance in their human prey due to the exponentially increasing deadweight loss imposed by takings. Chicago also believes that because political markets tend towards efficiency, policy advice by scholars is irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Palda, Filip. ''A Better Kind of Violence: Chicago Political Economy, Public Choice, and the Quest for an Ultimate Theory of Power''. Cooper-Wolfling Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Rowley is a prominent opponent of these notions and has set out his views in the Encyclopedia of Public Choice where he writes that Chicago's "… interpretation of the political process emanates from a fundamentally flawed application of … microeconomics to the political marketplace … while the Journal of Political Economy publishes papers that defend the U.S. federal farm program as an efficient mechanism for transferring income to poor farmers, there is justifiable cause to worry whether CPE [Chicago political economy] scholars and their journal editors ever look out from their ivory towers and survey the real world."&lt;ref&gt;Rowley, Charles K. "Public Choice and Constitutional Political Economy". Pages 3-31 in The Encyclopedia of Public Choice. Edited by Rowley, Charles, Schneider, Friedrich. Springer. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Public Choice Society is an outgrowth of the Virginia School.

'''Workers with Family Responsibilities Convention, 1981''' is  an [[International Labour Organization]] [[International Labour Organization#International Labour Conference|Convention]].

It was established in 1981, with the preamble stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Having decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to equal opportunities and equal treatment for men and women workers: workers with family responsibilities,...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 1 provides the definition of "workers with family responsibilities" and Article 3 cites [[Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention]] (ILO Convention C 111) to define the [[discrimination]]. This Convention is cited by [[Maternity Protection Convention, 2000]] (ILO Convention C 183). 
== Ratifications ==
As of May 2015, the convention had been ratified by 44 states.
