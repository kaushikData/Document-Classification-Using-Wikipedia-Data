'''Adult animation''', '''adult cartoon''' or '''mature animation''', is any type of [[animation|animated]] motion work that is mainly targeted towards adults and older adolescents, as opposed to children or all-ages audiences. Works in this genre may be considered adult for any number of reasons, such as complex themes, sexual or suggestive content, graphic violence, profane language or dark humor. Works in this genre may explore philosophical, political, or social issues. Some productions are noted for sophisticated and/or experimental storytelling and animation techniques.

In the United States, before the enforcement of the [[Hays Code]], some cartoon shorts contained humor that was aimed at adult audience members rather than children. Following the introduction of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system]], [[independent animation]] producers attempted to establish an alternative to mainstream animation. Initially, few animation studios in the United States attempted to produce animation for adult audiences, but later examples of animation produced for adults would gain mainstream attention and success.

==History==

===United States===
====Pre-code animation====
The earliest cartoon series were based upon popular [[comic strip]]s, and were directed at family audiences. Most animation produced during the [[silent film]] era was not intended to be shown to any specific age group, but occasionally contained humor that was directed at adult audience members, including risqué jokes.&lt;ref name="Cohen-9"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Animation and censorship in the silent film era |pages=9–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumed audience of these early cartoons, particularly ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', has alternated from their initial unspecific audience, to children, and back to general audiences as "classics".{{Disputed inline|"Early" cartoons|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first1=Jason|last1=Mittell|title=Genre and Television|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781135458836|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known instance of censorship in animation occurred when the censorship board of Pennsylvania requested that references to [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] be removed from [[Walt Disney]]'s 1925 short ''[[Alice Comedies|Alice Solves a Puzzle]]''.&lt;ref name="Cohen-9"/&gt; One of the earliest animated [[pornographic films]] was ''[[Eveready Harton in Buried Treasure]]'', produced circa 1928. It has often been suggested that the film was produced for a private party in honor of [[Winsor McCay]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-9"/&gt; Rumors suggest that the film was developed in [[Cuba]] years after it was completed, because no lab in New York City would process the film.&lt;ref name="Cohen-9"/&gt; When a print was screened in San Francisco in the late 1970s, the program notes attributed the animation to [[George Stallings]], George Canata, Rudy Zamora, Sr. and [[Walter Lantz]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-9"/&gt;

The [[Motion Picture Association of America]], then known as the Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors Association, was established in 1922 as the result of public objection to adult content in films, and a series of guidelines were established, suggesting content that should not be portrayed in films.&lt;ref name="Cohen-9"/&gt; Until the [[Hays Code]] was enforced, many animated shorts featured suggestive content, including [[sexual innuendo]], references to alcohol and drug use, and mild [[profanity]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-13"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Pre-Code films – the early sound era |pages=13–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1933 short ''[[Bosko's Picture Show]]'', [[Bosko]] appears to use adult words, although it has also been suggested that the character is saying "[[fox]]", or even "[[mug]]".&lt;ref name="Cohen-13"/&gt;

The [[Betty Boop]] series was known for its use of jokes that would eventually be considered taboo following the enforcement of the Hays Code, including the use of nudity.&lt;ref name="Cohen-13" /&gt; Betty Boop was initially drawn as a dog, and cast as the girlfriend of another Fleischer character, [[Bimbo (Fleischer)|Bimbo]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-13" /&gt; Betty was redesigned as a human, but the series continued to suggest a love relationship between the two that went farther than the normal relationship between humans and their pets.&lt;ref name="Cohen-13" /&gt; The short ''[[Is My Palm Read]]'' contains a scene in which Betty is shown as a child between the ages of four and five, bathing in the nude.&lt;ref name="Cohen-13" /&gt; In the 1970s, this scene was shown out of context in performances by [[Oingo Boingo|The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo]]. Concert audiences were not aware that Betty was supposed to be a baby in the sequence.&lt;ref name="Cohen-13" /&gt;

Another short, ''Bamboo Isle'', contains a sequence in which Betty dances the [[hula]] topless, wearing only a [[lei (garland)|lei]] over her breasts and a [[grass skirt]]. According to animator [[Shamus Culhane]], [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] were shocked by the sequence, but because it was a major sequence, it could not be cut out of the film. Culhane also states that he does not remember any instance in which the film was censored.&lt;ref name="Cohen-13"/&gt; Betty’s hula animation was reused for a cameo appearance with [[Popeye the Sailor]] in his self-titled animated debut short.

Following the enforcement of the Hays Code, Betty's clothing was redesigned, and all future shorts portrayed her with a longer dress which did not portray her physique and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Cohen-20"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=The effects of censorship on the Fleischer Studios |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shorts produced following the enforcement of the Hays Code were also less surreal in nature, and Betty was portrayed as a rational adult.&lt;ref name="Cohen-20"/&gt;

====After the Hays Code====
By 1968, the Hays Office had been eliminated, and the former guidelines were replaced by the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-77"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Uncensored Animation |page=77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lifting of the Code meant that animated features from other countries could be distributed without censorship, and that censorship would not be required for American productions.&lt;ref name="Cohen-77"/&gt; Some underground cartoon features from the late 1960s were also aimed at an adult audience, such as ''[[Bambi Meets Godzilla]]'' (1968), and the anti-war films ''[[Escalation (animated short)|Escalation]]'' (1968), and ''[[Mickey Mouse in Vietnam]]'' (1969). ''Escalation'' in particular is interesting because it was made by Disney animator [[Ward Kimball]], independently from the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Studios]]. Film producer John Magnuson completed an animated short based upon an audio recording of a comedy routine by [[Lenny Bruce]] titled ''[[Thank You Mask Man]]'' (1971), in which [[The Lone Ranger]] shocks the residents of the town he saves when he tells them that he wants to have sex with [[Tonto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ruppel |first1=Richard Jeffrey |title=Homosexuality in the Life and Work of Joseph Conrad: Love Between the Lines |year=2008 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=0-415-95587-4 |pages=22–23 |chapter=Male Intimacy in Conrad's Tales of Adventure |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The short was made by [[San Francisco]]-based company Imagination, Inc. and directed by Jeff Hale, a former member of the [[National Film Board of Canada]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-78"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=[[Lenny Bruce]]'s ''[[Thank You Mask Man]]'' |pages=78–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was scheduled to premiere on the opening night of ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'', as a supplement preceding the main feature, but was not shown.&lt;ref name="Cohen-78"/&gt; According to a former staff member of the festival, Magnuson ran up the aisle and shouted "They crucified Lenny when he was alive and now that he is dead they are screwing him again!"&lt;ref name="Cohen-78"/&gt; The festival's director told Magnuson that the producer of ''Z'' did not want any short shown that night. Rumors suggested that the wife of one of the festival's financiers hated Bruce, and threatened to withdraw her husband's money if the short was screened.&lt;ref name="Cohen-78"/&gt; ''Thank You Mask Man'' was later shown in art house screenings, and gained a following, but screenings did not perform well enough financially for Magnuson to profit from the film.&lt;ref name="Cohen-78"/&gt;

=====Ralph Bakshi=====
[[File:RalphBakshiJan09.jpg|thumb|left|Ralph Bakshi successfully established an alternative to mainstream animation through independent and adult-oriented productions in the 1970s.]]
By the late-1960s, animator [[Ralph Bakshi]] felt that he could not continue to produce the same kind of animation as he had in the past. Bakshi was quoted in a 1971 article for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as saying that the idea of "grown men sitting in cubicles drawing butterflies floating over a field of flowers, while American planes are dropping bombs in [[Vietnam]] and kids are marching in the streets, is ludicrous."&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartOne/FritzOne.htm |title=The Filming of ''Fritz the Cat'': Bucking the Tide |accessdate=2 March 2007 |author=Barrier, Michael |authorlink=Michael Barrier (historian) |date=Spring 1972 |publisher=Funnyworld, No. 14 |quote= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070415194357/http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartOne/FritzOne.htm| archivedate= 15 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; With producer [[Steve Krantz]], Bakshi founded his own studio, Bakshi Productions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |page=54 |chapter=First Gigs }}&lt;/ref&gt; establishing the studio as an alternative to mainstream animation by producing animation his own way and accelerating the advancement of female and minority animators. He also paid his employees a higher salary than any other studio at that time.{{sfn|Sito|2006|page=50}}

In 1969, [[Ralph's Spot]] was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for [[Coca-Cola]] and ''[[Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse]]'', a series of educational shorts paid for by [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Television/radio Age |year=1969 |publisher=Television Editorial Corp |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |pages=58; 62–63; 80–81 |chapter=''Fritz the Cat'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal. Bakshi soon developed ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'', a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt; While browsing the East Side Book Store on [[St. Mark's Place (Manhattan)|St. Mark's Place]], Bakshi came across a copy of [[Robert Crumb]]'s ''[[Fritz the Cat]]''. Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt;

''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'' was the first animated film to receive an [[X-rated|X rating]] from the MPAA, and the highest grossing independent animated film of all time.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt; While the film is widely noted in its innovation for featuring content that had not been portrayed in American animation before, such as explicit sexuality and violence, the film also offered commercial potential for alternative and independent animated films in the [[United States]], as the film offered a mature, satirical portrayal of the 1960s, including portrayal of drug use, political tension and race relations.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=John |title=Masters of Animation |year=2001 |publisher=Watson-Guptill |isbn=0-8230-3041-5 |pages=18–29 |chapter=Ralph Bakshi }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi has been credited for playing an important role in establishing animation as a medium where any story can be told, rather than a medium for children.&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert W. |last=Butler |title=''Animated films are banging seriously at the academy’s glass ceiling'' |url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/story/1008376.html |work=[[The Kansas City Star]] |date=31 January 2009 |accessdate=2 March 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the acceptance of Bakshi's features, the director suggested that ''[[War and Peace]]'' could be produced as an animated film.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;

Because of the perception that ''Fritz the Cat'' was pornographic, Krantz attempted to appeal the film's rating, but the MPAA refused to hear the appeal.&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Ralph Bakshi's ''Fritz the Cat'' and ''Heavy Traffic'' |pages=81–84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Praise from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'', and the film's acceptance into the [[1972 Cannes Film Festival]] cleared up previous misconceptions.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt; Bakshi then simultaneously directed a number of animated films, starting with ''[[Heavy Traffic]]''. Krantz was nervous about showing too much nudity and sexual content, and had several versions of some scenes animated.&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"/&gt; Thanks to ''Heavy Traffic'', Bakshi became the first person in the animation industry since [[Walt Disney]] to have two financially successful films released back-to-back.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|page=275}} Although the film was critically praised, it was banned by the film censorship board in the province of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] when it was originally released.&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"/&gt;

Bakshi's next film, ''[[Coonskin (film)|Coonskin]]'' was produced by [[Albert S. Ruddy]]. The film, culled from Bakshi's interest in African-American history in America, was an attack on racism and racist stereotypes.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Darius |title=That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury) |year=1995 |publisher= St. Martin's Griffin|location= New York|isbn=0-312-13192-5 |chapter=Rappin' with the rib-ticklin' Ralph Bakshi |pages=117–123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi hired several African-American animators to work on ''Coonskin'' and another feature, ''[[Hey Good Lookin' (film)|Hey Good Lookin']]'',&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=''Coonskin'' |pages=84–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Brenda Banks]], the first African-American female animator.{{sfn|Sito|2006|pages=230–231}} After the release was stalled by protests from the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], which accused both the film and Bakshi himself of being racist, the film was given [[limited release|limited distribution]], advertised as an [[exploitation film]], and soon disappeared from theaters.&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt;

Bakshi avoided controversy by producing [[fantasy film]]s, including ''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]''.

Although some adult-oriented animated films achieved success, very few animation studios in the United States produced explicitly adult animation during the 1970s, and much of the adult-oriented animation produced in the 1980s and 1990s was critically and commercially unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt; Krantz produced ''[[The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat]]'' without Bakshi's involvement, and it was released in June 1974 to negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sabin |first1=Roger |title=Comic Books for Adults |year=1992 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=0-415-04419-7 |page=212 |chapter=Aspects }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Swenson]] developed ''[[Down and Dirty Duck]]'' as a project for [[Flo and Eddie]] ([[Howard Kaylan]] and [[Mark Volman]], formerly of [[The Turtles]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]]) under the title ''Cheap!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |chapter=Dirty Duck |isbn=978-1-55652-591-9|page=66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen-89"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Charles Swenson's ''Dirty Duck'' |pages=89–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, produced by [[Roger Corman]], was released on June 13, 1977&lt;ref&gt;Kaylan, Howard, "Getting Spit On By the Boss Himself!".

However, in 1987, [[Italian-Canadian]] cartoonist [[Danny Antonucci]], who would later create the television series ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'' for [[Cartoon Network]], released a successful short film titled ''[[Lupo the Butcher]]''. The short follows the story of a psychotic, temperamental butcher who swears at his meat when the smallest things go wrong. Produced by [[Marv Newland]]'s International Rocketship Limited, ''Lupo the Butcher'' has become a cult following and opened floodgates to irreverent adult animated series.&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;Mac, Gabe (August 25, 2006).

The 2016 film ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke (film)|The Killing Joke]]'' was the first film in the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]] series and the first animated [[Batman]] film to receive an R rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], with [[Warner Bros. Animation]] president [[Sam Register]] explaining, "From the start of production, we encouraged producer [[Bruce Timm]] and our team at [[Warner Bros.

We felt it was our responsibility to present our core audience—the comics-loving community—with an animated film that authentically represented the tale they know all too well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/14/batman-killing-joke-animated-rated-r | title=Batman: The Killing Joke animated movie receives R rating—exclusive | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=April 14, 2016 | accessdate=April 15, 2016 | last=Gettell | first=Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in a limited theatrical screening on July 25, 2016.&lt;ref name="Fathom"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/29648-animated-batman-the-killing-joke-to-get-limited-theatrical-release.html | title=Animated BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE To Get Limited Theatrical Release | publisher=[[Newsarama]] | date=June 8, 2016 | accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sausage Party]]'', released in 2016, became the first CGI film to be rated R by the MPAA.

====Festivals====
In 1988, [[San Francisco]] exhibitor [[Expanded Cinema]] screened a compilation of adult-oriented animated shorts under the title "Outrageous Animation".&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Programs of shorts – from the Tournée of animation to Sick &amp; Twisted shows |pages=102–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising the package as containing "the wildest cartoons ever", the screenings contained shorts produced outside the United States, as well as independently produced American shorts.&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt; Reviews of the festival were mixed. ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' writer [[Mick LaSalle]] hated almost everything screened at the festival, with the exception of [[Bill Plympton]]'s ''[[One of Those Days]]''.&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt; In ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', David Armstrong gave the show a three-star review and described the films screened as having "some of the rude vitality of the great old Warner Bros. cartoons —and a good deal of the sexual explicitness denied those old favorites from a more cautious age."&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt;

In 1990, Mellow Manor Productions began screening films under the title ''[[Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation]]''.&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt; Founders Craig "Spike" Decker and Mike Gribble promoted their festival by handing out flyers on the streets rather than with traditional promotional techniques.&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt; In 1991, Decker and Gribble screened their first "All Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation", promising "wild and zany films that could never be shown to our 'normal audience'".&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt; The festival screened newer independent shorts, as well as older shorts such as ''Bambi Meets Godzilla'', and ''Thank You Mask Man''.&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt; Although the festival promoted works by animators who would later gain mainstream success, such as [[Bill Plympton]], [[Mike Judge]], [[Trey Parker]] and [[Don Hertzfeldt]], many reviewers dismissed the bulk of the programming as [[shock value]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-102"/&gt;

In 2003, Judge and Hertzfeldt created a new touring festival of animation marketed towards adults and college students. [[The Animation Show]] brought animated shorts into more North American theaters than any previous commercial festival.&lt;ref name="animation show"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animationshow.com/About |title=About The Animation Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Television animation====
From 1972 to 1974, [[Hanna-Barbera]] produced ''[[Wait Till Your Father Gets Home]]'', an adult-oriented sitcom in the style of ''[[All in the Family]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McNeil |first1=Alex |title=Total Television: A Comprehensive Guide to Programming from 1948 to 1980 |year=1980 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0-14-004911-8 |page=755 |chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series dealt with subjects such as [[feminism]] and the [[generation gap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jerome |first1=Fiona |last2=Dickson |first2=Seth |title=Classic TV: The Friends, The Foes, The Fighters of Crime, The Good, The Glam, and The Famous Last Line |year=2006 |isbn=1-4027-3672-X |page=16 |chapter=Before ''The Simpsons'' |publisher=Main Street |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of animated television programs appeared which challenged the [[Standards &amp; Practices]] guidelines, including ''[[The Simpsons]]'',&lt;ref name="Cohen-144"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Breaking the rules in the 1990s |pages=144–146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', ''[[The Critic]]'', ''[[The Brothers Grunt]]'' and ''[[Duckman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mangan |first=Jennifer|title="Modern Life Not Meant For Kids" - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=April 7, 2014 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/doc/283626453.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Breaking the rules in the 1990s |pages=143–144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' aired in prime time, therefore it was not censored as much as programs intended to air on Saturday mornings.&lt;ref name="Cohen-144"/&gt; In addition to the show's portrayal of brief nudity and mild language, the series has dealt with mature themes and subjects such as death, gambling addiction, religion and suicide.&lt;ref name="Cohen-144"/&gt;

In 1989, ''The Simpsons'' began airing on [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] in prime time, becoming a massive hit among American audiences. In response, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[NBC]] each developed animated series to air in prime time, but none of the shows were successful.&lt;ref name="PrimeTimeAnimation"&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first=Carol A. |editor1-last=Stabile |editor2-first=Mark |editor2-last=Harrison |title=Prime Time Animation: Television Animation and American Culture |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-28326-4 |pages=79–80 |chapter=The second prime time animation boom }}&lt;/ref&gt; One series, ''[[Capitol Critters]]'', focused on subjects such as gun control, interracial violence and political corruption.&lt;ref name="Lowry"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lowry |first1=Brian |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Variety Television Reviews 1991–92 |year=1994 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=0-8240-3796-0 |chapter=Capitol Critters |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of the series, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' critic Brian Lowry wrote that he felt that the series' approach was "muddled", and that "the bland central character and cartoonish elements [...] will likely be off-putting to many adults, who won't find the political satire biting enough to merit their continued attention. Similarly, kids probably won't be as smitten with the cartoon aspects or look".&lt;ref name="Lowry"/&gt; The series was cancelled after one month.&lt;ref name="PrimeTimeAnimation"/&gt; ''The Critic'' was somewhat more successful, but achieved low ratings because of ABC's sporadic scheduling, and was cancelled by the network.&lt;ref name="PrimeTimeAnimation"/&gt; Fox picked up the series, but cancelled it four months later.&lt;ref name="PrimeTimeAnimation"/&gt; While Fox allowed ''The Simpsons'' to portray animated depictions of human buttocks, ABC would not allow similar scenes to appear on ''The Critic''.&lt;ref name="Cohen-144"/&gt;

''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' was controversial for its portrayal of brief nudity, profanity and violence.&lt;ref name="Cohen-146"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=''Beavis &amp; Butt-head'' and the S&amp;P Rules |pages=146–148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the series was intended for adult audiences, it was shown in the afternoons, and multiple parents claimed that their children had imitated the show's characters.&lt;ref name="Cohen-146"/&gt; The first instance of such an accusation occurred when animal lovers in [[Santa Cruz, California]] claimed that someone had blown up a cat after seeing Beavis and Butt-head perform this act on television.&lt;ref name="Cohen-146"/&gt; In actuality, no such scene had ever been portrayed.&lt;ref name="Cohen-146"/&gt; When a five-year-old boy in Ohio set his bed on fire, killing his two-year-old sister, critics claimed that the incident was the result of an episode involving fire, although it has never been proven that the boy had ever watched the series.&lt;ref name="Cohen-146"/&gt; [[MTV]] responded by moving the series to a later airtime and adding disclaimers to future episodes stating explicitly not to imitate the actions of the characters, as well as removing all references to fire from the episodes.&lt;ref name="Cohen-146"/&gt;

Discussions involving a series based upon Trey Parker and [[Matt Stone]]'s video Christmas card, ''[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|The Spirit of Christmas]]'', led [[HBO]] to contact Ralph Bakshi in order to produce an animated series targeted specifically toward adults.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-234"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |pages=234–235 |chapter=Ups &amp; Downs }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi enlisted a team of writers, including his son, Preston, to develop ''[Spicy Detective'', later renamed ''[[Spicy City]]'', an [[anthology series]] set in a [[Film noir|noir-ish]], technology-driven future.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; Each episode featuring a different story narrated by a female host named [[Raven]], voiced by [[Michelle Phillips]]. The series premiered in July 1997, beating ''South Park'' to television by over a month and becoming the first "adults only" cartoon series.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-234"/&gt; Although critical reaction was mixed and largely unfavorable, ''Spicy City'' received acceptable ratings.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; A second season was approved, but the network wanted to fire Bakshi's writing team and hire professional [[Los Angeles]] screenwriters. When Bakshi refused to cooperate with the network, the series was canceled.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-234"/&gt;

In 2001, [[Time Warner]] established [[Adult Swim]] as a programming block on Cartoon Network, aimed for an adult audience. Its schedule currently includes original programs such as ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', ''[[Squidbillies]]'' and ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', and reruns of syndicated programs such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[King of the Hill]]'' (all of which had their original run on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Suzanne C. |last=Ryan |title=''Adult Swim makes a splash: Cartoon Network lures viewers with an edgy lineup'' |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/04/14/adult_swim_makes_a_splash/ |work=The Boston Globe |date=14 April 2005 |accessdate=4 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American audiences have become more accepting of adult-oriented animation through the popularity of American-produced comedic television shows. Dramatic series such as ''[[Aeon Flux]]'' and ''[[Invasion America]]'' are less common, and still rarely successful.&lt;ref name="Lent-65"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lent |first1=John A. |title=Animation in Asia and the Pacific |year=2001 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-34035-7 |chapter=Anime in the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In 1954, a British film studio produced an animated adaptation of [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]''. This film is believed to have been one of the earliest examples of British animation, and like the book is meant to be a portrayal or critique of [[Stalinism]] with characters serving as analogues to figures from the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].

For many years, it had been problematic to import films that did not meet the approval of the [[United States Customs Service]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-90"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Importing foreign productions |pages=90–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the [[Customs Service]] refused entry of a short film titled ''Sinderella'', depicting scenes of [[sexual intercourse]] between characters based upon ''[[Cinderella]]'', ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'', ''[[Puss in Boots (fairy tale)|Puss in Boots]]'', ''[[The Story of the Three Bears|Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]'' and ''[[Prince Charming]]''.&lt;ref name="Cohen-90"/&gt; The film was seized as obscene material, and its distributor filed a court case and an appeal in 1974, but lost both.&lt;ref name="Cohen-90"/&gt;

In 1973, [[Rene Laloux]] directed ''[[La Planète sauvage]]'' based on the [[France|French]] science fiction novel ''[[Oms en série]]'' by [[Stefan Wul]]. It has been televised in the United States and United Kingdom as ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'', and several DVD editions have been released. Also in 1973, an [[Italy|Italian]] film, ''[[Il nano e la strega|King Dick]]'', was released and became a cult classic in the United Kingdom. A [[West Germany|West German]] short called ''[[Snow White and the Seven Perverts]]'' ("''[[Schneeflittchen unter die Sieben Bergen]]''") also appeared. This little film mostly parodies [[Snow White]] and has been included as part of other compilation films.

The first foreign animated feature to receive both an X rating and [[wide release|wide distribution]] in the [[United States]] was ''[[Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle]]''.&lt;ref name="Cohen-90"/&gt; A dubbed version, which featured new dialogue performed by American actors and comedians such as [[John Belushi]], [[Adolph Caesar]], [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], [[Judy Graubart]], [[Bill Murray]] and [[Johnny Weissmuller Jr.]], received an R rating.&lt;ref name="Cohen-90"/&gt; According to distributor [[Stuart S. Shapiro]], the X rating hurt the film's distribution, but the dubbed version "took the bite out of the film. It lost its outrageousness."&lt;ref name="Cohen-90"/&gt; ''Tarzoon'' was banned by the New Zealand Board of Censors in 1980.&lt;ref name="Cohen-90"/&gt;

In [[England]], [[Martin Rosen (director)|Martin Rosen]] directed two animated features based on the novels of [[Richard Adams]]: ''[[Watership Down (film)|Watership Down]]'' in 1978, and ''[[The Plague Dogs (film)|The Plague Dogs]]'' in 1982. Both films deal with adult themes: ''Watership Down'', the negotiation of leadership to organize an exodus away from persecution, and ''[[The Plague Dogs]]'' on animal testing.

''[[Pink Floyd – The Wall]]'', an adaptation of [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[concept album]] [[The Wall|of the same name]], featured fifteen minutes of painstaking traditional animation in addition to numerous live-action sequences; although the film was not by any stretch pornographic, it was an adult film (with numerous references to drugs, mental illness and sex, along with one animated sequence portraying a character talking out of his [[rectum]] and having a [[scrotum]] for a beard) and received an R rating when imported to the United States.
	 
In 1986, England produced yet another politically-themed animation, ''[[When the Wind Blows (1986 film)|When the Wind Blows]]'', about an older couple whose home undergoes a nuclear attack.

''[[Werner (comics)|Werner]]'' - a German animated film based on the comic book. In an episode of many characters use profanity and [[middle finger|flip the bird]].

''[[Felidae (film)|Felidae]]'' is a 1994 German animated neo-noir crime film based on [[Akif Pirinçci|Akif Pirinçci's]] 1989 [[Felidae (novel)|novel of the same name]]. It features graphic violent and sexual content involving animals.

[[Soyuzmultfilm]] produced children's animation as well as animations aimed more at adults, such as [[Film, Film, Film]], a satirical animation about the film industry in the Soviet Union, and [[Laughter and Grief by the White Sea#Notes|Pomorskaya Byl]], a serious account of the death of two [[Pomor]] fishermen, stranded in the middle of the [[White Sea]].

===Japan===
{{see also|Anime}}
[[File:Anime DVDs.JPG|thumb|Shelves displaying Japanese anime.]]
Adult animation is known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|アダルトアニメ}} (adult anime). In both English and Japanese, the word "adult" may carry connotations of a sexual nature, but anime on serious topics such as ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' or ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' often get referred to as "adult" in Japan as well, even when sex is not a key part of the story.

Animated works of an erotic nature have come to be described in western fandom as ''[[hentai]]'', the Japanese word for "perverted",&lt;ref name="Poitras-50"&gt;{{cite book|title=Anime Essentials: Every Thing a Fan Needs to Know|last1=Poitras|first1=Gilles|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|year=2001|isbn=1-880656-53-1|page=50|chapter=Hentai}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Japan they are more likely to be referred to as {{nihongo|18禁アニメ}} (R-18 anime) or {{nihongo|エロアニメ}} (erotic anime).  Although some associate all anime with sexual content, hentai only makes up a very small portion of the Japanese animation industry.&lt;ref name="Poitras-50" /&gt; As the result of the misconceptions about Japanese animation, some video stores outside Japan have classified children's anime as for adults only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Poitras |first1=Gilles |title=Anime Essentials: Every Thing a Fan Needs to Know |year=2001 |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |isbn=1-880656-53-1 |page=52 |chapter=Press coverage of sex and anime }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many video stores have also categorized all adult-oriented animation as anime, including the works of [[Ralph Bakshi]], the [[France|French]] animated film ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'', the [[Canada|Canadian]] animated film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' and the [[HBO]] television series ''[[Todd McFarlane's Spawn]]''.&lt;ref name="Lent-65" /&gt;  In the case of ''Spawn'', [[Todd McFarlane]] directly listed [[anime]] as an influence, particularly [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', and stated his hope that the show would help encourage the rise of adult animation on [[North America]]n [[Television network|network]]s. This in part lead to the involvement of the Japanese studio [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] in the production, in an attempt to "combine" the Eastern and Western styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=Todd McFarlane's Spawn 2 |url= |first=Todd |last=McFarlane |authorlink=Todd McFarlane |others= |type=Special features |publisher=HBO Home Video |location= |id= |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Some of the earliest manga magazines were aimed at adults, and this provided a prime source as the basis for adult anime works. ''[[Weekly Manga Times]]'' began publication in 1956, and would be followed by ''[[Weekly Manga Goraku]]'' (1964), and ''[[Manga Action]]'' (1967). Anime works based on adult manga include ''[[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]]'', ''[[Hellsing]] Ultimate'', ''[[Maison Ikkoku]]'', ''[[Mushishi]]'', ''[[Golden Boy (manga)|Golden Boy]]'' and ''[[Tokyo Daigaku Monogatari]]''.
	 
In 1969, [[Osamu Tezuka]] and [[Eiichi Yamamoto]] released ''[[Senya Ichiya Monogatari]]'' (千夜一夜物語) the first of a series of three animated feature films aimed at an adult audience. It was dubbed and released in the United States as ''[[One Thousand and One Arabian Nights (film)|One Thousand and One Arabian Nights]]''. [[Osamu Tezuka]] and [[Eiichi Yamamoto]] collaborated on the second film in the Animerama series ''[[Kureopatora]]'' (クレオパトラ) released in the United States as ''[[Cleopatra (1970 film)|Cleopatra: Queen of Sex]]''. The third film ''[[Kanashimi no Belladonna|Kanashimi no Beradonna]]'' (哀しみのベラドンナ) was directed by [[Eiichi Yamamoto]] alone. It was entered in the [[Berlin International Film Festival]], but did not achieve commercial success.
	 
In 1984, [[original video animation]] (OVA) of an erotic nature began to be released, first ''[[Lolita Anime]]'' by Wonder Kids based on the manga work of Fumio Nakajima, and then later in the year ''[[Cream Lemon]]'', a series which proved to be a big hit in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:くりいむレモン]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[La Blue Girl]]'' and ''[[New Angel]]'' are two other erotic anime to be released in United States and Europe in the early 1990s.

1988 saw the release of ''Akira'' directed by [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] which was dubbed and shown in North American theaters, and released on [[VHS]] around the world. Its success led to a greater interest in Japanese adult anime in the US, and opened the door for other titles. In 1995, ''Ghost in the Shell'' was released as a feature film, directed by [[Mamoru Oshii]] based on the manga by [[Masamune Shirow]]. It received critical acclaim in both Japan, and abroad hinting further at the possibilities of adult animation.
	 
The North American [[Adult Swim]] channel has been airing adult-oriented anime series on Saturday nights: ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[FLCL]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'', ''[[IGPX]]'' and ''[[Space Dandy]]''. Four of the Japanese TV networks have similar late night anime blocks: [[Fuji Television]]'s ''[[Noitamina]]'', [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]]'s ''Animeism and Anime Shower'', [[Asahi Broadcasting Corporation]]'s ''Wednesday Anime'' and [[Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation]]'s ''Manpa''.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:深夜アニメ]]&lt;/ref&gt; The programs aired have included ''[[Angel Heart (manga)|Angel Heart]]'', ''[[Genji Monogatari Sennenki]]'' and ''[[Hellsing]]''.

Starting in 2004, [[Mahiro Maeda]] directed a multi-episode anime adaptation of [[Alexandre Dumas]]' novel as ''[[Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo]]''. It was aired on [[Animax]] in [[Asia]], and [[FUNimation]] in the United States, and received critical acclaim in the anime press.

An '''artist collective''' is an initiative that is the result of a group of [[artist]]s working together, usually under their own [[management]], towards shared aims. The aims of an artist collective can include almost anything that is relevant to the needs of the [[artist]], this can range from purchasing bulk [[List of artistic media|materials]], sharing equipment, space or materials, through to following shared [[ideologies]], [[aesthetic]] and [[politics|political]] views or even living and working together as an [[extended family]]. Sharing of ownership, risk, benefits, and status is implied, as opposed to other, more common business structures with an explicit hierarchy of ownership such as an [[Voluntary association|association]] or a [[company]].

==Overview==
Artist collectives have occurred throughout history, often gathered around central resources, for instance the ancient sculpture workshops at the marble quarries on [[Milos]] in Greece and [[Carrara]] in Italy. Collectives featured during both the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolution]] when they were set up by the state in all major communities, and the [[French Revolution]] when the [[Louvre]] in Paris was occupied as an artist collective.

More traditional artist collectives tend to be smallish groups of two to eight artists who produce work, either collaboratively or as individuals toward exhibiting together in [[Art gallery|gallery]] shows or public spaces. Often an artists collective will maintain a collective space, for exhibiting or as workshop or studio facilities. Some newer, more experimental kinds of groups include intentional networks, anonymous, connector, hidden or nested groups, and groups with unconventional time-scales.  Artist collectives may be formed: For economic reasons, to give members volume purchasing power and allow costs of publicity and shows to be shared. For political reasons, to increase local lobbying power for arts infrastructure, to gather behind a cause or belief. For professional reasons, to develop a higher group profile that benefits the individuals by association, to create a hub for curators and commissioners to more easily locate potential talent.

'''Athena'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|n|ə}}; [[Attic Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀθηνᾶ}}, ''Athēnā'', or {{lang|grc|Ἀθηναία}}, ''Athēnaia''; [[Epic Greek|Epic]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀθηναίη}}, ''Athēnaiē''; [[Doric Greek|Doric]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀθάνα}}, ''Athānā''}} or '''Athene''',{{efn|{{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|n|iː}}; [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀθήνη}}, ''Athēnē''}} often given the [[epithet]] '''Pallas''',{{efn|{{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|l|ə|s}}; {{lang|grc|Παλλὰς}}}} is an [[ancient Greek religion|ancient Greek goddess]] associated with wisdom, handicraft, and warfare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Inc |first1=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature |date=1995 |publisher=Merriam-Webster |isbn=9780877790426 |page=81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&amp;pg=PA81}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was later [[Interpretatio graeca|syncretized]] with the [[Roman goddess]] [[Minerva]].{{sfn|Deacy|Villing|2001|pages=}} Athena was regarded as the patron and protectress of various cities across Greece, particularly the city of [[Athens]], from which she most likely received her name.&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO SAY ATHENS WAS NAMED AFTER ATHENA. Walter Burkert, a major authority on ancient Greek religion, states, "Since -ene is a typical place-name suffix - Mykene, Pallene, Troizen(e), Messene, and Cyrene - the goddess most probably takes her name from the city; she is the Pallas of Athens, just as Hera of Argos is Here Argeie." Thank you.--&gt;{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} She is usually shown in art wearing a helmet and holding a spear. Her major symbols include [[Owl of Minerva|owls]], olive trees, [[snake]]s, and the [[Gorgoneion]].

From her origin as an Aegean [[tutelary deity|palace goddess]], Athena was closely associated with the city. She was known as ''Polias'' and ''Poliouchos'' (both derived from ''[[polis]]'', meaning "city-state"), and her temples were usually located atop the fortified [[Acropolis]] in the central part of the city. The [[Parthenon]] on the [[Athenian Acropolis]] is dedicated to her, along with numerous other temples and monuments. As the patron of craft and weaving, Athena was known as ''Ergane''. She was also a [[Women in ancient warfare|warrior goddess]], and was believed to lead soldiers into battle as ''[[Athena Promachos]]''. Her main festival in Athens was the [[Panathenaic Games|Panathenaia]], which was celebrated during the month of [[Attic calendar|Hekatombaion]] in midsummer and was the most important festival on the Athenian calendar.

In [[Greek mythology]], Athena was believed to have been born from the head of her father [[Zeus]]. In the [[founding myth]] of Athens, Athena bested [[Poseidon]] in a competition over patronage of the city by creating the first [[olive tree]]. She was known as ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' ("Athena the Virgin"), but, in one archaic [[Attica|Attic]] myth, the god [[Hephaestus]] tried and failed to rape her, resulting in [[Gaia]] giving birth to [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]], an important Athenian founding hero. Athena was the patron goddess of heroic endeavor; she was believed to have also aided the heroes [[Perseus]], [[Heracles]], [[Bellerophon]], and [[Jason]]. Along with [[Aphrodite]] and [[Hera]], Athena was one of the three goddesses [[Judgement of Paris|whose feud]] resulted in the beginning of the [[Trojan War]]. She plays an active role in the ''[[Iliad]]'', in which she assists the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] and, in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', she is the divine counselor to [[Odysseus]].

In the later writings of the Roman poet [[Ovid]], Athena was said to have competed against the mortal [[Arachne]] in a weaving competition, afterwards transforming Arachne into the first spider; Ovid also describes how she transformed [[Medusa]] into a [[Gorgon]] after witnessing her being raped by Poseidon in her temple. Since the [[Renaissance]], Athena has become an international symbol of wisdom, the arts, and [[Classics|classical learning]]. Western artists and allegorists have often used Athena as a symbol of [[freedom]] and [[democracy]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Akropolis by Leo von Klenze.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Acropolis at Athens'' (1846) by [[Leo von Klenze]]. Athena's name probably comes from the name of the city of [[Athens]].{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}}{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}}]]

Athena is associated with the city of [[Athens]].{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=230}} The name of the city in ancient Greek is ''Ἀθῆναι'' (''Athenai''), a plural [[toponym]], designating the place where—according to myth—she presided over the ''Athenai'', a sisterhood devoted to her worship.{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}} In ancient times, scholars argued whether Athena was named after Athens or Athens after Athena.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} Now scholars generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city;{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=230}} the ending -''ene'' is common in names of locations, but rare for personal names.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} Testimonies from different cities in [[ancient Greece]] attest that similar [[city goddess]]es were worshipped in other cities{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}} and, like Athena, took their names from the cities where they were worshipped.{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}} For example, in [[Mycenae]] there was a goddess called Mykene, whose sisterhood was known as ''Mykenai'',{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}} whereas at [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] an analogous deity was called Thebe, and the city was known under the plural form ''Thebai'' (or Thebes, in English, where the ‘s’ is the plural formation).{{snf|Ruck|Staples|1994|page=24}} The name ''Athenai'' is likely of [[Pre-Greek]] origin{{snf|Beekes|2009|page=29}} because it contains the presumably Pre-Greek morpheme ''*-ān-''.{{snf|Beekes|2009|page=29}}

In his dialogue ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', the Greek philosopher [[Plato]] (428–347 BC) gives some rather imaginative etymologies of Athena's name, based on the theories of the ancient Athenians and his own etymological speculations:

{{quote|That is a graver matter, and there, my friend, the modern interpreters of Homer may, I think, assist in explaining the view of the ancients. For most of these in their explanations of the poet, assert that he meant by Athena "mind" [{{lang|grc|νοῦς}}, ''[[Nous|noũs]]''] and "intelligence" [{{lang|grc|διάνοια}}, ''[[diánoia]]''], and the maker of names appears to have had a singular notion about her; and indeed calls her by a still higher title, "divine intelligence" [{{lang|grc|θεοῦ νόησις}}, ''theoũ nóēsis''], as though he would say: This is she who has the mind of God [{{lang|grc|ἁ θεονόα}}, ''a theonóa''). Perhaps, however, the name Theonoe may mean "she who knows divine things" [{{lang|grc|τὰ θεῖα νοοῦσα}}, ''ta theia noousa''] better than others. Nor shall we be far wrong in supposing that the author of it wished to identify this Goddess with moral intelligence [{{lang|grc|εν έθει νόεσιν}}, ''en éthei nóesin''], and therefore gave her the name Etheonoe; which, however, either he or his successors have altered into what they thought a nicer form, and called her Athena''.|author=Plato|title=Cratylus ''407b''}}

Thus, Plato believed that Athena's name was derived from Greek {{lang|grc|Ἀθεονόα}}, ''Atheonóa''—which the later Greeks rationalised as from the deity's (θεός, ''theós'') mind (νοῦς, ''noũs''). The second-century AD orator [[Aelius Aristides]] attempted to derive natural symbols from the etymological roots of Athena's names to be ''aether'', ''air'', ''earth'', and ''moon''.{{snf|Johrens|1981|pages=438–452}}

==Origins==
[[File:Goddess-boars-tusk-griffin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Fragment of a fresco from the Cult Center at [[Mycenae]] dating the late thirteenth century BC depicting a warrior goddess, possibly Athena, wearing a [[boar's tusk helmet]] and clutching a [[griffin]]{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|page=14}}]]

Athena was originally the [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]] goddess of the palace, who presided over household crafts and protected the king.{{sfn|Nilsson|1967|pages=347, 433}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=140}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=133}}{{sfn|Kinsley|1989|pages=141–142}} A single [[Mycenaean Greek]] inscription {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀲𐀙𐀡𐀴𐀛𐀊}} ''a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja'' /Athana potnia/ appears at [[Knossos]] in the [[Linear B]] tablets from the Late Minoan II-era "Room of the Chariot Tablets";{{sfn|Chadwick|1976|pages=88–89}}{{sfn|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|page=126}}{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|page=14}} these comprise the earliest Linear B archive anywhere.{{sfn|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|page=126}} Although ''Athana potnia'' is often translated ''Mistress Athena'',{{sfn|Palaima|2004|page=444}} it could also mean "the ''[[Potnia]]'' of Athana", or ''the Lady of Athens''.{{sfn|Palaima|2004|page=444}}{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|page=14}} However, any connection to the city of Athens in the Knossos inscription is uncertain.{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=44}} A sign series ''a-ta-no-dju-wa-ja'' appears in the still undeciphered corpus of [[Linear A]] tablets, written in the unclassified [[Minoan language]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kophinas|KO]] Za 1 inscription, line 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This could be connected with the Linear B Mycenaean expressions ''a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja'' and ''di-u-ja'' or ''di-wi-ja'' (''Diwia'', "of Zeus" or, possibly, related to a [[List of Mycenaean deities#Goddesses|homonymous goddess]]),{{sfn|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|page=126}} resulting in a translation "Athena of Zeus" or "divine Athena". Similarly, in the Greek mythology and epic tradition, Athena figures as a daughter of Zeus (Διός θυγάτηρ; ''cfr.'' [[Dyeus]]).{{sfn|Best|1989|page=30}} However, the inscription quoted seems to be very similar to "a-ta-nū-tī wa-ya", quoted as [[Kato Syme|SY]] Za 1 by Jan Best.{{sfn|Best|1989|page=30}} Best translates the initial ''a-ta-nū-tī'', which is recurrent in line beginnings, as "I have given".{{sfn|Best|1989|page=30}}

A [[Mycenea]]n fresco depicts two women extending their hands towards a central figure, who is covered by an enormous figure-eight shield;{{sfn|Mylonas|1966|page=159}}{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|pages=13–14}} this may depict the warrior-goddess with her ''[[Palladium (classical antiquity)|palladion]]'', or her palladion in an aniconic representation.{{sfn|Mylonas|1966|page=159}}{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|pages=13–14}} In the "[[List of Aegean frescos|Procession Fresco]]" at [[Knossos]], which was reconstructed by the Mycenaeans,{{sfn|Fururmark|1978|page=672}} two rows of figures carrying vessels seem to meet in front of a central figure,{{sfn|Fururmark|1978|page=672}} which is probably the Minoan precursor to Athena.{{sfn|Fururmark|1978|page=672}} The early twentieth-century scholar [[Martin P. Nilsson|Martin Persson Nilsson]] argued that the [[Minoan snake goddess figurines]] are early representations of Athena.{{sfn|Nilsson|1967|pages=347, 433}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=140}}

Nilsson and others have claimed that, in early times, Athena was either an [[owl]] herself or a [[bird goddess]] in general.{{snf|Nilsson|1950|page=496}} In the third book of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', she takes the form of a [[Sea eagle (bird)|sea-eagle]].{{snf|Nilsson|1950|page=496}} Proponents of this view argue that she dropped her prophylactic owl-mask before she lost her wings.

Athena was known as ''Atrytone'' ({{lang|grc|Άτρυτώνη}} "the Unwearying"), ''Parthenos'' ({{lang|grc|Παρθένος}} "Virgin"), and ''Promachos'' ({{lang|grc|Πρόμαχος}} "she who fights in front"). The epithet ''Polias'' (Πολιάς "of the city"), refers to Athena's role as protectress of the city.{{snf|Schmitt|2000|pages=1059–1073}} The epithet ''Ergane'' (Εργάνη "the Industrious") pointed her out as the patron of craftsmen and artisans.{{sfn|Schmitt|2000|pages=1059–1073}} Burkert notes that the Athenians sometimes simply called Athena "the Goddess", ''hē theós'' (ἡ θεός), certainly an ancient title.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} After serving as the judge at the trial of [[Orestes]] in which he was acquitted of having murdered his mother [[Clytemnestra]], Athena won the epithet ''Areia'' (Αρεία).{{sfn|Schmitt|2000|pages=1059–1073}}

Athena was sometimes given the epithet ''Hippia'' (Ἵππια "of the horses", "equestrian"),{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|page=15}}{{sfn|Hubbard|1986|page=28}} referring to her invention of the [[bit (horse)|bit]], [[bridle]], [[chariot]], and [[wagon]].{{sfn|Hurwit|1999|page=15}} The Greek geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions in his ''Guide to Greece'' that the temple of Athena ''Chalinitis'' ("the bridler"){{sfn|Hubbard|1986|page=28}} in Corinth was located near the tomb of [[Medea]]'s children.{{sfn|Hubbard|1986|page=28}} Other epithets include [[Ageleia]], [[Itonia]] and ''Aethyia'', under which she was worshiped in [[Megara]].{{sfn|Bell|1993|page=13}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], i. 5. § 3; 41. § 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''aíthyia'' ({{lang|grc|αἴθυια}}) signifies a "diver", also some diving bird species (possibly the [[shearwater]]) and figuratively, a "ship", so the name must reference Athena teaching the art of shipbuilding or navigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tzetzes]], ''ad Lycophr.'', ''l.c.''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a temple at Phrixa in [[Elis]], reportedly built by [[Clymenus]], she was known as ''Cydonia'' (Κυδωνία).{{sfn|Schaus|Wenn|2007|page=30}}

The Greek biographer [[Plutarch]] (46–120 AD) refers to an instance during the Parthenon's construction of her being called ''Athena [[Hygieia]]'' (Ὑγίεια, i.&amp;nbsp;e. personified "Health"):

{{quote|A strange accident happened in the course of building, which showed that the goddess was not averse to the work, but was aiding and co-operating to bring it to perfection. One of the artificers, the quickest and the handiest workman among them all, with a slip of his foot fell down from a great height, and lay in a miserable condition, the physicians having no hope of his recovery. When [[Pericles]] was in distress about this, the goddess [Athena] appeared to him at night in a dream, and ordered a course of treatment, which he applied, and in a short time and with great ease cured the man. And upon this occasion it was that he set up a brass statue of Athena Hygeia, in the citadel near the altar, which they say was there before. But it was [[Phidias]] who wrought the goddess's image in gold, and he has his name inscribed on the pedestal as the workman of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plutarch, Life of Pericles |date=1916 |publisher=uchicago.edu |chapter-url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pericles*.html#13 |chapter=13 |quote=The Parallel Lives by Plutarch published in Vol. III of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Homer]]'s [[Epic poetry|epic works]], Athena's most common [[epithets in Homer|epithet]] is ''Glaukopis'' ({{lang|grc|γλαυκῶπις}}), which usually is translated as, "bright-eyed" or "with gleaming eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|glaukw{{=}}pis|γλαυκῶπις|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a combination of ''glaukós'' ({{lang|grc|γλαυκός}}, meaning "gleaming, silvery", and later, "bluish-green" or "gray")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|glauko/s1|γλαυκός|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ṓps'' ({{lang|grc|ὤψ}}, "eye, face").&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|w)/y|ὤψ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''glaúx'' ({{lang|grc|γλαύξ}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Thompson, D'Arcy Wentworth |authorlink1=D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson |title=A glossary of Greek birds |date=1895 |publisher=Oxford, Clarendon Press |page=45 |url=https://archive.org/stream/glossaryofgreekb00thomrich#page/44/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; "little owl")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|glau/c|γλαύξ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is from the same root, presumably according to some, because of the bird's own distinctive eyes. Athena was clearly associated with the owl from very early on;{{sfn|Nilsson|1950|pages=491–496}} in archaic images, she is frequently depicted with an [[Owl of Athena|owl]] perched on her hand.{{sfn|Nilsson|1950|pages=491–496}} Through its association with Athena, the owl evolved into the national mascot of the Athenians and eventually became a symbol of wisdom.{{sfn|Deacy|Villing|2001|pages=}}

In the ''[[Iliad]]'' (4.514), the ''[[Odyssey]]'' (3.378), the ''[[Homeric Hymns]]'', and in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Athena is also given the curious epithet ''Tritogeneia'' (Τριτογένεια), whose significance remains unclear.{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=55}} It could mean various things, including "Triton-born", perhaps indicating that the [[Triton (mythology)|homonymous sea-deity]] was her parent according to some early myths.{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=55}} One myth relates the foster father relationship of this Triton towards the half-orphan Athena, whom he raised alongside his own daughter [[Pallas (daughter of Triton)|Pallas]].{{sfn|Graves|1960|pages=50–55}} Kerényi suggests that "Tritogeneia did not mean that she came into the world on any particular river or lake, but that she was born of the water itself; for the name Triton seems to be associated with water generally."{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=128}}&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*tritoge/neia|Τριτογένεια|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', Athena is occasionally referred to as "Tritonia".

Another possible meaning may be "triple-born" or "third-born", which may refer to a triad or to her status as the third daughter of Zeus or the fact she was born from Metis, Zeus, and herself; various legends list her as being the first child after Artemis and Apollo, though other legends identify her as Zeus' first child.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' II, 886–900.&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars have suggested a connection to the [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] god [[Trita]],{{sfn|Janda|2005|page=289-298}} who was sometimes grouped in a body of three mythological poets.{{sfn|Janda|2005|page=289-298}} Michael Janda has connected the myth of Trita to the scene in the ''[[Iliad]]'' in which the "three brothers" Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades divide the world between them, receiving the "broad sky", the sea, and the underworld respectively.{{sfn|Janda|2005|page=293}}&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' XV, 187–195.&lt;/ref&gt; Janda further connects the myth of Athena being born of the head (i.&amp;nbsp;e. the uppermost part) of Zeus, understanding ''Trito-'' (which perhaps originally meant "the third") as another word for "the sky".{{sfn|Janda|2005|page=293}} In Janda's analysis of Indo-European mythology, this heavenly sphere is also associated with the mythological body of water surrounding the inhabited world (''cfr.'' Triton's mother, [[Amphitrite]]).{{sfn|Janda|2005|page=293}}

===Pallas Athena===

Athena's epithet ''Pallas'' is derived either from {{lang|grc|πάλλω}}, meaning "to brandish [as a weapon]", or, more likely, from {{lang|grc|παλλακίς}} and related words, meaning "youth, young woman".&lt;ref&gt;Chantraine, s.v.;  the ''New Pauly'' says the etymology is simply unknown&lt;/ref&gt; On this topic, Walter Burkert says "she is the Pallas of Athens, ''Pallas Athenaie'', just as Hera of Argos is ''Here Argeie''."{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} In later times, after the original meaning of the name had been forgotten, the Greeks invented myths to explain its origin, such as those reported by the Epicurean philosopher [[Philodemus]] and the ''Bibliotheca'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus, which claim that ''Pallas'' was originally a separate entity, whom Athena had slain in combat.&lt;ref&gt;''New Pauly'' s.v. Pallas&lt;/ref&gt;

In one version of the myth, [[Pallas (daughter of Triton)|Pallas]] was the daughter of the sea-god [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]];{{sfn|Graves|1960|pages=50–55}} she and Athena were childhood friends, but Athena accidentally killed her during a friendly [[sparring]] match.{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=50}} Distraught over what she had done, Athena took the name Pallas for herself as a sign of her grief.{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=50}} In another version of the story, [[Pallas (Giant)|Pallas]] was a [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Gigante]];{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=120}} Athena slew him during the [[Gigantomachy]] and [[flaying|flayed off]] his skin to make her cloak, which she wore as a victory trophy.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=120}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=140}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=51}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=231}} In an alternative variation of the same myth, Pallas was instead Athena's father,{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=120}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=140}} who attempted to assault his own daughter,{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=120-121}} causing Athena to kill him and take his skin as a trophy.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=121}}

The ''[[Palladium (classical antiquity)|palladion]]'' was a statue of Athena that was said to have stood in her temple on the Trojan Acropolis.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=68}} Athena was said to have carved the statue herself in the likeness of her dead friend Pallas.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=68}} The statue had special talisman-like properties{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=68}} and it was thought that, as long as it was in the city, Troy could never fall.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=68}} When the Greeks captured Troy, [[Cassandra]], the daughter of [[Priam]], clung to the palladion for protection,{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=68}} but [[Ajax the Lesser]] violently tore her away from it and dragged her over to the other captives.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=68}} Athena was infuriated by this violation of her protection.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=68–69}} Although Agamemnon attempted to placate her anger with sacrifices, Athena sent a storm at Cape Kaphereos to destroy almost the entire Greek fleet and scatter all of the surviving ships across the Aegean.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=71}}

In a [[founding myth]] reported by Pseudo-Apollodorus,{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=281}} Athena competed with [[Poseidon]] for the patronage of Athens.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=124}} They agreed that each would give the Athenians one gift{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=124}} and that [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], the king of Athens, would determine which gift was better.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=124}} Poseidon struck the ground with his [[trident]] and a salt water spring sprang up;{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=124}} this gave the Athenians access to trade and water.{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=62}} Athens at its height was a significant sea power, defeating the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] fleet at the [[Battle of Salamis]]{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=62}}—but the water was salty and undrinkable.{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=62}} In an alternative version of the myth from [[Vergil]]'s ''[[Georgics]]'',{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=281}} Poseidon instead gave the Athenians the first horse.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=124}} Athena offered the first domesticated [[olive tree]].{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=124}}{{sfn|Garland|2008|page=217}} Cecrops accepted this gift{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=124}} and declared Athena the patron goddess of Athens.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=124}} The olive tree brought wood, oil, and food,{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=62}} and became a symbol of Athenian economic prosperity.{{sfn|Garland|2008|page=217}}{{sfn|Kinsley|1989|page=143}} [[Robert Graves]] was of the opinion that "Poseidon's attempts to take possession of certain cities are political myths",{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=62}} which reflect the conflict between matriarchal and patriarchal religions.{{sfn|Graves|1960|page=62}}

Pseudo-Apollodorus{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=281}} records an archaic legend, which claims that [[Hephaestus]] once attempted to rape Athena, but she pushed him away, causing him to [[ejaculate]] on her thigh.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} Athena wiped the [[semen]] off using a tuft of [[wool]], which she tossed into the dust,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} impregnating [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and causing her to give birth to [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]].{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} Athena adopted Erichthonius as her son and raised him.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} The Roman mythographer [[Hyginus]]{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=281}} records a similar story in which Hephaestus demanded Zeus to let him marry Athena since he was the one who had smashed open Zeus's skull, allowing Athena to be born.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}} Zeus agreed to this and Hephaestus and Athena were married,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}} but, when Hephaestus was about to consummate the union, Athena vanished from the bridal bed, causing him to ejaculate on the floor, thus impregnating Gaia with Erichthonius.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}

The geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=281}} records that Athena placed the infant Erichthonius into a small chest{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} (''cista''), which she entrusted to the care of the three daughters of [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]]: [[Herse]], [[Pandrosos]], and [[Aglaulus, daughter of Cecrops|Aglauros]] of Athens.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} She warned the three sisters not to open the chest,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} but did not explain to them why or what was in it.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} Aglauros, and possibly one of the other sisters,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} opened the chest.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=125}} Differing reports say that they either found that the child itself was a serpent, that it was guarded by a serpent, that it was guarded by two serpents, or that it had the legs of a serpent.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|pages=125–126}} In Pausanias's story, the two sisters were driven mad by the sight of the chest's contents and hurled themselves off the [[Acropolis]], dying instantly,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=126}} but an Attic vase painting shows them being chased by the serpent off the edge of the cliff instead.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=126}}

Erichthonius was one of the most important founding heroes of Athens{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}} and the legend of the daughters of Cecrops was a cult myth linked to the rituals of the [[Arrhephoria]] festival.{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=88–89}} Pausanias records that, during the Arrhephoria, two young girls known as the ''Arrhephoroi'', who lived near the temple of Athena Polias, would be given hidden objects by the priestess of Athena,{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=89}} which they would carry on their heads down a natural underground passage.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=89}} They would leave the objects they had been given at the bottom of the passage and take another set of hidden objects,{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=89}} which they would carry on their heads back up to the temple.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=89}} The ritual was performed in the dead of night{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=89}} and no one, not even the priestess, knew what the objects were.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=89}} The serpent in the story may be the same one depicted coiled at Athena's feet in Pheidias's famous statue of the ''Athena Parthenos'' in the Parthenon.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=88}} Many of the surviving sculptures of Athena show this serpent.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=88}}

Herodotus records that a serpent lived in a crevice on the north side of the summit of the Athenian Acropolis{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=88}} and that the Athenians left a honey cake for it each month as an offering.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=88}} On the eve of the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]] in 480 BC, the serpent did not eat the honey cake{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=88}} and the Athenians interpreted it as a sign that Athena herself had abandoned them.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=88}} Another version of the myth of the Athenian maidens is told in ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' by the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (43 BC{{snds}}17 AD); in this late variant [[Hermes]] falls in love with Herse. Herse, Aglaulus, and Pandrosus go to the temple to offer sacrifices to Athena. Hermes demands help from Aglaulus to seduce Herse. Aglaulus demands money in exchange. Hermes gives her the money the sisters have already offered to Athena. As punishment for Aglaulus's greed, Athena asks the goddess [[Invidia|Envy]] to make Aglaulus jealous of Herse. When Hermes arrives to seduce Herse, Aglaulus stands in his way instead of helping him as she had agreed. He turns her to stone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'', X. Aglaura, Book II, 708–751; XI. The Envy, Book II, 752–832.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pseudo-Apollodorus's ''Bibliotheca'', Athena advised [[Argus (son of Arestor)|Argos]], the builder of the ''[[Argo]]'', the ship on which the hero [[Jason]] and his band of [[Argonauts]] sailed, and aided in the ship's construction.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9%3Asection%3D16 1.9.16]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=124}} Pseudo-Apollodorus also records that Athena guided the hero [[Perseus (mythology)|Perseus]] in his quest to behead [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]].{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=141}}{{sfn|Kinsley|1989|page=151}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=61}} She and [[Hermes]], the god of travelers, appeared to Perseus after he set off on his quest and gifted him with tools he would need to kill the Gorgon.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=61}}&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.37, 38, 39&lt;/ref&gt; Athena gave Perseus a polished bronze shield to view Medusa's reflection rather than looking at her directly and thereby avoid being turned to stone.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=61}}&lt;ref name="Bibliotheca2.41"&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.41&lt;/ref&gt; Hermes gave him an [[adamant]]ine [[scythe]] to cut off Medusa's head.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=61}}&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.39&lt;/ref&gt; When Perseus swung his blade to behead Medusa, Athena guided it, allowing his scythe to cut it clean off.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=61}}&lt;ref name="Bibliotheca2.41"/&gt; According to Pindar's ''Thirteenth Olympian Ode'', Athena helped the hero [[Bellerophon]] tame the winged horse [[Pegasus]] by giving him a [[Bit (horse)|bit]].{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=48}}&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Olympian Ode'' 13.75-78&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Greek art]], Athena is frequently shown aiding the hero [[Heracles]].{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=64–65}} She appears in four of the twelve [[metope]]s on the [[Temple of Zeus at Olympia]] depicting Heracles's [[Labors of Heracles|Twelve Labors]],{{sfn|Pollitt|1999|pages=48–50}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=64–65}} including the first, in which she passively watches him slay the [[Nemean lion]],{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=64–65}} and the tenth, in which she is shown actively helping him hold up the sky.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=65}} She is presented as his "stern ally",{{sfn|Pollitt|1999|page=50}} but also the "gentle... acknowledger of his achievements."{{sfn|Pollitt|1999|page=50}} Artistic depictions of Heracles's [[apotheosis]] show Athena driving him to Mount Olympus in her chariot and presenting him to Zeus for his deification.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=65}} In [[Aeschylus]]'s tragedy ''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'', Athena intervenes to save [[Orestes]] from the wrath of the [[Erinyes]] and presides over his trial for the murder of his mother [[Clytemnestra]].{{sfn|Roman|Roman|2010|page=161}} When half the [[jury]] votes to [[acquittal|acquit]] and the other half votes to [[convict]], Athena casts the deciding vote to acquit Orestes{{sfn|Roman|Roman|2010|page=161}} and declares that, from then on, whenever a jury is tied, the defendant shall always be acquitted.{{sfn|Roman|Roman|2010|pages=161–162}}

===Punishment myths===
[[File:Gorgona pushkin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Classical Greek depiction of [[Medusa]] from the fourth century BC]]

The [[Gorgoneion]] appears to have originated as an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] symbol intended to ward off evil.{{sfn|Phinney|1971|pages=445–447}} In a late myth invented to explain the origins of the Gorgon,{{sfn|Phinney|1971|pages=445–463}} [[Medusa]] is described as having been a young priestess who served in the temple of Athena in Athens.{{sfn|Seelig|2002|page=895}} Poseidon lusted after Medusa, and raped her in the temple of Athena,{{sfn|Seelig|2002|page=895}} refusing to allow her vow of chastity to stand in his way.{{sfn|Seelig|2002|page=895}} Upon discovering the desecration of her temple, Athena transformed Medusa into a hideous monster with serpents for hair whose gaze [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|would turn any mortal to stone]].{{sfn|Seelig|2002|page=895-911}}

In his ''Twelfth Pythian Ode'', [[Pindar]] recounts the story of how Athena invented the ''[[aulos]]'', a kind of flute, in imitation of the lamentations of Medusa's sisters, the Gorgons, after she was beheaded by the hero [[Perseus]].{{sfn|Poehlmann|2017|page=330}} According to Pindar, Athena gave the aulos to mortals as a gift.{{sfn|Poehlmann|2017|page=330}} Later, the comic playwright [[Melanippides|Melanippides of Melos]] ({{circa}} 480-430 BC) embellished the story in his comedy ''Marsyas'',{{sfn|Poehlmann|2017|page=330}} claiming that Athena looked in the mirror while she was playing the aulos and saw how blowing into it puffed up her cheeks and made her look silly, so she threw the aulos away and cursed it so that whoever picked it up would meet an awful death.{{sfn|Poehlmann|2017|page=330}} The aulos was picked up by the satyr [[Marsyas]], who was later killed by Apollo for his [[hubris]].{{sfn|Poehlmann|2017|page=330}} Later, this version of the story became accepted as canonical{{sfn|Poehlmann|2017|page=330}} and the Athenian sculptor [[Myron]] created a group of bronze sculptures based on it, which was installed before the western front of the Parthenon in around 440 BC.{{sfn|Poehlmann|2017|page=330}}

A myth told by the early third-century BC Hellenistic poet [[Callimachus]] in his ''Hymn'' 5 begins with Athena bathing in a spring on [[Mount Helicon]] at midday with one of her favorite companions, the nymph [[Chariclo]].{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}}{{sfn|Morford|Lenardon|1999|page=315}} Chariclo's son [[Tiresias]] happened to be hunting on the same mountain and came to the spring searching for water.{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}}{{sfn|Morford|Lenardon|1999|page=315}} He inadvertently saw Athena naked, so she struck him blind to ensure he would never again see what man was not intended to see.{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}}{{sfn|Morford|Lenardon|1999|pages=315–316}}{{sfn|Kugelmann|1983|page=73}} Chariclo intervened on her son's behalf and begged Athena to have mercy.{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}}{{sfn|Kugelmann|1983|page=73}}{{sfn|Morford|Lenardon|1999|page=316}} Athena replied that she could not restore Tiresias's eyesight,{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}}{{sfn|Kugelmann|1983|page=73}}{{sfn|Morford|Lenardon|1999|page=316}} so, instead, she gave him the ability to understand the language of the birds and thus foretell the future.{{sfn|Edmunds|1990|page=373}}{{sfn|Morford|Lenardon|1999|page=316}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}}

{{Main|Judgement of Paris}}

[[File:Judgement Paris Antioch Louvre Ma3443.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Ancient Greek mosaic from [[Antioch]] dating to the second century AD, depicting the [[Judgement of Paris]]]]

The myth of the Judgement of Paris is mentioned briefly in the ''[[Iliad]]'',{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=31}} but is described in depth in an [[epitome]] of the ''[[Cypria]]'', a lost poem of the [[Epic Cycle]],{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=31–32}} which records that all the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]] (the eventual parents of [[Achilles]]).{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=31}} Only [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], goddess of discord, was not invited.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=31–32}} She was annoyed at this, so she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word καλλίστῃ (kallistēi, "for the fairest"), which she threw among the goddesses.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}}

The goddesses chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a [[Troy|Trojan]] prince.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} After bathing in the spring of [[Mount Ida]] where Troy was situated, the goddesses appeared before Paris for his decision.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} In the extant ancient depictions of the Judgement of Paris, Aphrodite is only occasionally represented nude, and Athena and Hera are always fully clothed.{{sfn|Bull|2005|pages=346–347}} Since the [[Renaissance]], however, western paintings have typically portrayed all three goddesses as completely naked.{{sfn|Bull|2005|pages=346–347}}

All three goddesses were ideally beautiful and Paris could not decide between them, so they resorted to bribes.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} Hera tried to bribe Paris with power over all [[Asia]] and [[Europe]],{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} and Athena offered fame and glory in battle,{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} but Aphrodite promised Paris that, if he were to choose her as the fairest, she would let him marry the most beautiful woman on earth.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=32–33}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} This woman was [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], who was already married to King [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta#Prehistory|Sparta]].{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=32–33}} Paris selected Aphrodite and awarded her the apple.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=32–33}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}} The other two goddesses were enraged and, as a direct result, sided with the Greeks in the [[Trojan War]].{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=32–33}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=125}}

In Books V–VI of the ''[[Iliad]]'', Athena aids the hero [[Diomedes]], who, in the absence of Achilles, proves himself to be the most effective Greek warrior.{{sfn|Burgess|2001|page=84}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=124}} Several artistic representations from the early sixth century BC may show Athena and Diomedes,{{sfn|Burgess|2001|page=84}} including an early sixth-century BC shield band depicting Athena and an unidentified warrior riding on a chariot, a vase painting of a warrior with his charioteer facing Athena, and an inscribed clay plaque showing Diomedes and Athena riding in a chariot.{{sfn|Burgess|2001|page=84}} Numerous passages in the ''Iliad'' also mention Athena having previously served as the patron of Diomedes's father [[Tydeus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 4.390, 5.115-120, 10.284-94&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Burgess|2001|pages=84–85}} When the Trojan women go to the temple of Athena on the Acropolis to plead her for protection from Diomedes, Athena ignores them.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=68–69}}

In Book XXII of the ''Iliad'', while Achilles is chasing [[Hector]] around the walls of Troy, Athena appears to Hector disguised as his brother [[Deiphobus]]{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=69}} and persuades him to hold his ground so that they can fight Achilles together.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=69}} Then, Hector throws his spear at Achilles and misses, expecting Deiphobus to hand him another,{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=69–70}} but Athena disappears instead, leaving Hector to face Achilles alone without his spear.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=69–70}} In [[Sophocles]]'s tragedy ''[[Ajax (play)|Ajax]]'', she punishes Odysseus's rival [[Ajax the Great]], driving him insane and causing him to massacre the Achaeans' cattle, thinking that he is slaughtering the Achaeans themselves.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=59–60}} Even after Odysseus himself expresses pity for Ajax,{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=60}} Athena declares, "To laugh at your enemies - what sweeter laughter can there be than that?" (lines 78–9).{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=60}} Ajax later commits [[suicide]] as a result of his humiliation.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=60}}

==Classical art==

Athena appears frequently in classical Greek art, including on coins and in paintings on ceramics.{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=193}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=126}} She is especially prominent in works produced in Athens.{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=193}} In classical depictions, Athena is usually portrayed standing upright, wearing a full-length [[chiton (costume)|chiton]].{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=28-32}} She is most often represented dressed in armor like a male soldier{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=126}}{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=28-32}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=230}} and wearing a [[Corinthian helmet]] raised high atop her forehead.{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=32}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=230}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=126}} Her shield bears at its centre the aegis with the head of the gorgon (''gorgoneion'') in the center and snakes around the edge.{{sfn|Phinney|1971|pages=445–463}} Sometimes she is shown wearing the aegis as a cloak.{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=126}} As Athena Promachos, she is shown brandishing a spear.{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=193}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=230}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|page=126}} Scenes in which Athena was represented include her birth from the head of Zeus, her battle with the [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Gigantes]], the birth of Erichthonius, and the Judgement of Paris.{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=193}}

The ''[[Mourning Athena]]'' or ''Athena Meditating'' is a famous relief sculpture dating to around 470-460 BC{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=32}}{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=193}} that has been interpreted to represent Athena Polias.{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=32}} The most famous classical depiction of Athena was the ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'', a now-lost thirty-six-meter-tall [[Chryselephantine|gold and ivory]] statue of her in the [[Parthenon]] created by the Athenian sculptor [[Phidias]].{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=28-32}}{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=193}} Copies reveal that this statue depicted Athena holding her shield in her left hand with [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the winged goddess of victory, standing in her right.{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=193}} Athena Polias is also represented in a Neo-Attic relief now held in the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]],{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=32}} which depicts her holding an owl in her hand{{efn|The owl's role as a symbol of wisdom originates in this association with Athena.}} and wearing her characteristic Corinthian helmet while resting her shield against a nearby ''[[herma]]''.{{sfn|Palagia|Pollitt|1996|page=32}} The Roman goddess Minerva adopted most of Athena's Greek iconographical associations,{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=194}} but was also integrated into the [[Capitoline Triad]].{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=194}}

Early Christian writers, such as [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Julius Firmicus Maternus|Firmicus]], denigrated Athena as representative of all the things that were detestable about paganism;{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=141–144}} they condemned her as "immodest and immoral".{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=144}} During the Middle Ages, however, many attributes of Athena were given to the [[Virgin Mary]],{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=144}} who, in fourth century portrayals, was often depicted wearing the [[Gorgoneion]].{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=144}} Some even viewed the Virgin Mary as a warrior maiden, much like Athena Parthenos;{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=144}} one anecdote tells that the Virgin Mary once appeared upon the walls of [[Constantinople]] when it was under siege by the Avars, clutching a spear and urging the people to fight.{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=144–145}} During the Middle Ages, Athena became widely used as a Christian symbol and allegory, and she appeared on the family crests of certain noble houses.{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=146–148}}

During the Renaissance, Athena donned the mantle of patron of the arts and human endeavor;{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=145–146}} allegorical paintings involving Athena were a favorite of the Italian Renaissance painters.{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=145–146}} In [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s painting ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', probably painted sometime in the 1480s, Athena is the personification of chastity, who is shown grasping the forelock of a centaur, who represents lust.{{sfn|Randolph|2002|page=221}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=145}} [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s 1502 painting ''[[Triumph of the Virtues (Mantegna)|Minerva Expelling the Vices from the Garden of Virtue]]'' uses Athena as the personification of Graeco-Roman learning chasing the vices of medievalism from the garden of modern scholarship.{{sfn|Brown|2007|page=1}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=145}}{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|pages=193–194}} Athena is also used as the personification of wisdom in [[Bartholomeus Spranger]]'s 1591 painting ''The Triumph of Wisdom'' or ''Minerva Victorious over Ignorance''.{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=194}}

During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Athena was used as a symbol for female rulers.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=147-148}} In his book ''A Revelation of the True Minerva'' (1582), [[Thomas Blennerhassett]] portrays [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I of England]] as a "new Minerva" and "the greatest goddesse nowe on earth".{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=147}} A series of paintings by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] depict Athena as [[Marie de' Medici]]'s patron and mentor;{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=148}} the final painting in the series goes even further and shows Marie de' Medici with Athena's iconography, as the mortal incarnation of the goddess herself.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=148}} The German sculptor [[Jean-Pierre-Antoine Tassaert]] later portrayed [[Catherine II of Russia]] as Athena in a marble bust in 1774.{{sfn|Aghion|Barbillon|Lissarrague|1996|page=194}} During the [[French Revolution]], statues of pagan gods were torn down all throughout France, but statues of Athena were not.{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=148}} Instead, Athena was transformed into the personification of freedom and the republic{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=148}} and a statue of the goddess stood in the center of the [[Place de la Revolution]] in Paris.{{snf|Deacy|2008|page=148}} In the years following the Revolution, artistic representations of Athena proliferated.{{snf|Deacy|2008|pages=148–149}}

A statue of Athena stands directly in front of the [[Austrian Parliament Building]] in [[Vienna]],{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=149}} and depictions of Athena have influenced other symbols of western freedom, including the [[Statue of Liberty]] and [[Britannia]].{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=149}} For over a century, [[Parthenon (Nashville)|a full-scale replica of the Parthenon]] has stood in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].{{sfn|Garland|2008|page=330}} In 1990, the curators added a gilded forty-two foot (12.5 m) tall [[Athena Parthenos#Replica at Nashville|replica of Phidias's ''Athena Parthenos'']], built from concrete and fiberglass.{{sfn|Garland|2008|page=330}} The state [[seal of California]] bears the image of Athena kneeling next to a brown grizzly bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=97 |title=Symbols of the Seal of California |publisher=LearnCalifornia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124160916/http://learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=97 |archivedate=24 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Athena has occasionally appeared on modern coins, as she did on the ancient Athenian [[drachma]].

One of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s most treasured possessions was a small, bronze statue of Athena, which sat on his desk.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=153}} Freud once described Athena as "a woman who is unapproachable and repels all sexual desires - since she displays the terrifying genitals of the Mother."{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=154}} [[Feminism|Feminist]] views on Athena are sharply divided;{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=154}} some feminists regard her as a symbol of female empowerment,{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=154}} while others regard her as "the ultimate [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] sell out... who uses her powers to promote and advance men rather than others of her sex."{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=154}} In contemporary [[Wicca]], Athena is venerated as an aspect of the [[Wiccan views of divinity|Goddess]]{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|page=109}} and some Wiccans believe that she may bestow the "Owl Gift" ("the ability to write and communicate clearly") upon her worshippers.{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|page=109}} Due to her status as one of the twelve Olympians, Athena is a major deity in [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenismos]],{{sfn|Alexander|2007|pages=31–32}} a [[Modern Paganism|Neopagan]] religion which seeks to authentically revive and recreate the religion of ancient Greece in the modern world.{{sfn|Alexander|2007|pages=11–20}}

Athena is a natural patron of universities: At [[Bryn Mawr College]] in Pennsylvania a statue of Athena (a replica of the original bronze one in the arts and archaeology library) resides in the Great Hall.{{sfn|Friedman|2005|page=121}} It is traditional at exam time for students to leave offerings to the goddess with a note asking for good luck,{{sfn|Friedman|2005|page=121}} or to repent for accidentally breaking any of the college's numerous other traditions.{{sfn|Friedman|2005|page=121}} Pallas Athena is the tutelary goddess of the international social fraternity [[Phi Delta Theta]].&lt;ref name="pdt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phideltatheta.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=122 |title=Phi Delta Theta International - Symbols |accessdate=2008-06-07 |publisher=phideltatheta.org |date= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080607045215/http://www.phideltatheta.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=122| archivedate= 7 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her owl is also a symbol of the fraternity.&lt;ref name="pdt"/&gt;

'''''Baraka''''' is a 1992 [[non-narrative film|non-narrative]] [[documentary film]] directed by [[Ron Fricke]]. The film is often compared to ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'', the first of the [[Qatsi trilogy|Qatsi]] films by [[Godfrey Reggio]] for which Fricke served as the [[cinematographer]].&lt;ref name="rotten_tomatoes" /&gt; It is also the most recent film to be photographed in the 70mm [[Todd-AO]] format, and the first film ever to be restored and scanned at [[8K resolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spiritofbaraka.com/baraka/ |title=Baraka |website=Spirit of Baraka|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roger_erbert" /&gt;

== Content ==
''Baraka'' is a [[documentary film]] with no [[narrative]] or [[voice-over]]. It explores themes via a compilation of natural events, life, human activities and technological phenomena shot in 24 countries on six continents over a 14-month period.

The film is [[Ron Fricke]]'s follow-up to [[Godfrey Reggio]]'s similar non-verbal documentary film ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]''. Fricke was cinematographer and collaborator on Reggio's film, and for ''Baraka'' he struck out on his own to polish and expand the photographic techniques used on ''Koyaanisqatsi''. Shot in [[70mm]], it includes a mixture of photographic styles including [[slow motion]] and [[time-lapse]].  Two camera systems were used to achieve this. A [[Todd-AO]] system was used to shoot conventional frame rates, but to execute the film's time-lapse sequences Fricke had a special camera built that combined [[time-lapse photography]] with perfectly controlled movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2011/magidson/index.htm |title=A Conversation with Mark Magidson and Ron Fricke |website=IN70MM.com|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locations featured include the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]], the [[Ryōan-ji|Ryoan]] temple in [[Kyoto]], [[Lake Natron]] in [[Tanzania]], burning oil fields in [[Kuwait]], the smouldering precipice of an [[active volcano]], a busy [[Rapid transit|subway]] terminal, tribal celebrations of the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] in [[Kenya]], and chanting monks in the [[Dip Tse Chok Ling]] monastery.

The film features a number of long [[tracking shot]]s through various settings, including [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|Tuol Sleng]], over photos of the people involved, past skulls stacked in a room, to a spread of bones. It suggests a universal cultural perspective: a shot of an elaborate [[tattoo]] on a bathing Japanese [[yakuza]] precedes a view of tribal paint.

== Music==
{{See also|Baraka: Music from the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack}}
The score is by [[Michael Stearns]] and features music by, among others, [[Dead Can Dance]], [[L. Subramaniam]], [[Ciro Hurtado]], [[Inkuyo]], [[Brother (band)|Brother]], [[Anugama]] &amp; Sebastiano, and [[David Hykes]].

== Reissue ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Baraka scanned at 8k.jpg|thumb|The original Baraka 65 mm negative being scanned at 8K resolution]] --&gt;
Following previous [[DVD]] releases, in 2007 the original 65&amp;nbsp;mm negative was re-scanned at [[8K resolution]] with equipment designed specifically for ''Baraka'' at [[FotoKem|FotoKem Laboratories]]. The automated 8K [[Motion picture film scanner|film scanner]], operating continuously, took more than three weeks to finish scanning more than 150,000 frames (taking approximately 12–13 seconds to scan each frame), producing over 30 [[terabyte]]s of image data in total. After a 16-month [[digital intermediate]] process, including a 96&amp;nbsp;kHz/24 bit audio [[audio mastering|remaster]] by Stearns for the [[DTS-HD Master Audio]] [[Baraka soundtrack|soundtrack of the film]], the result was re-released on DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc]] in October 2008. At the time, project supervisor Andrew Oran described the reissue of ''Baraka'' as "arguably the highest quality DVD that's ever been made".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video |title=Baraka: "Restoration" feature documentary |date=2008 |last=Oran |first=Andrew |publisher=Magidson Films, Inc |medium=DVD/Blu-ray}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' critic [[Roger Ebert]] described the Blu-ray release as "the finest video disc I have ever viewed or ever imagined."&lt;ref name="roger_erbert" &gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-baraka-1992 |title=Great Movies: Baraka (1992) |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |date=16 October 2008 |publisher=[[RogerEbert.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217075209/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20081016%2FREVIEWS08%2F810150290%2F1023 |archive-date=17 December 2008 |dead-url=no |access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sequel ==
A sequel to ''Baraka'', ''[[Samsara (2011 film)|Samsara]]'', made by the same filmmakers, premiered at the [[2011 Toronto International Film Festival]] and released internationally in August 2012. Also shot in 70mm, ''Samsara'' explores an arguably darker, updated version of many of the same themes as ''Baraka''.

== Reception ==
''Baraka'' has a score of 81% off [[Rotten Tomatoes]] out of 26 reviews.&lt;ref name="rotten_tomatoes" &gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/baraka/ |title=Baraka |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |language=en |access-date=7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] included the film in his "Great Movies" list, writing that "If man sends another Voyager to the distant stars and it can carry only one film on board, that film might be ''Baraka''."&lt;ref name="roger_erbert" /&gt;

== Filming ==
The movie was filmed at 152 locations in 23 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.barakasamsara.com/baraka/locations |title=Baraka Filming Locations |website=BarakaSamsara.com |language=en |access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some locations include: [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Cambodia]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Ecuador]], [[Egypt]], [[France]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Iran]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Israel]], [[Kenya]], [[Kuwait]], [[Nepal]], [[Poland]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Thailand]], [[Turkey]], [[United States]] and [[Vatican City]].

[[Image:Biblioburro.jpg|thumb|Luis Soriano (center) and one of his burros]]
The '''Biblioburro''' is a traveling library that distributes [[books]] to patrons from the backs of two [[donkeys]], Alfa and Beto. The program was created in [[La Gloria, Cesar|La Gloria]], [[Colombia]], by Luis Soriano.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;Romero, Simon. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/20/world/americas/20burro.html "Acclaimed Colombian Institution Has 4,800 Books and 10 Legs"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 19, 2008. Accessed October 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The biblioburro operates within the central municipalities of the [[Department of Magdalena]], on Colombia's [[Caribbean]] shore.

Soriano became fascinated with reading as a child and obtained a [[college degree]] in [[Spanish literature]] after studying with a professor who visited his village twice a month.&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;Reel, Monte. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/04/AR2005090401379.html "A Four-Legged Drive To Help Rural Readers"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', September 5, 2005. Accessed October 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A primary school teacher by profession, Soriano developed the idea after witnessing first-hand the power reading had on his students, most of whom had lived through intense life conflicts at a young age. Starting in the late 1990s, Soriano traveled to communities in Colombia's [[Caribbean Sea]] [[hinterland]]s with a portable library, which began with 70 books.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

Soriano wrote to [[Juan Gossaín]], a Colombian journalist and writer, after having heard him read excerpts from his novel ''The Ballad of Maria Abdala'' on a radio program. Soriano asked Gossaín for a copy of his book to be distributed on the Biblioburro, details that Gossaín broadcast on his radio program. The response created a flood of book donations and Soriano's collection soon expanded to 4,800 volumes. Currently, construction of a small library building funded by a local financial company is half-finished due to lack of funds.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Additional funding is also provided by the director of a community library, located nearly {{convert|180|mi}} from the Caribbean shore in [[Santa María, Huila|Santa Maria]], who hired Soriano as a satellite employee in order to share a portion of its US$7,000 annual budget.&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt;

Children's adventure stories have remained one of the most popular items distributed by the Biblioburros.&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt; In addition to encyclopedia volumes, novels, and medical texts, other items distributed by the Biblioburro include [[Horacio Quiroga]]'s animal fable ''Anaconda'', the Dictionary of the Spanish Language of the Royal Spanish Academy (''[[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española]]'') and a number of ''[[Time–Life]]'' travel pictorial books. Books lost from the collection include a sex education manual and a copy of [[Laura Esquivel]]'s 1989 novel ''[[Like Water for Chocolate]]'', both of which were not returned by borrowers. A copy of [[Paulo Coelho]]'s 1990 novel ''[[Brida (novel)|Brida]]'' was stolen by bandits, who tied up Soriano after attempting to rob him and discovered he had no money.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

[[Colombian people|Colombian]] documentary filmmaker [[Carlos Rendón Zipagauta]] has made a film that tells the story of Soriano and the Biblioburros.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/biblioburro/film_description.php#.UZShfZWYc18|title=Film Description &amp;#124; Biblioburro: The Donkey Library &amp;#124; POV &amp;#124; PBS|publisher=pbs.org|accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, Soriano had a leg amputated after an accident involving one of his burros, but as of January 2013 he continued committed to his work.&lt;ref name="educastur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.educastur.es/biblioluces/2013/01/31/homenaje-a-luis-humberto-soriano/|title=&amp;raquo; homenaje a Luis Humberto Soriano|publisher=blog.educastur.es|accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Captain Clegg''''' (released as '''''Night Creatures''''' in the United States) is a 1962 British [[adventure film|adventure]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Peter Graham Scott]] and produced by [[Hammer Film Productions]]. It is loosely based on [[Doctor Syn]], created by [[Russell Thorndike]], and stars [[Peter Cushing]], [[Yvonne Romain]] and [[Patrick Allen]].

==Plot==
In 1776, a [[mulatto]] sailor ([[Milton Reid]]) is marooned on an island after assaulting the wife of pirate captain Nathaniel Clegg.

By 1792, Clegg has supposedly been captured by the [[Royal Navy]] and hanged. His resting place is the coastal village of [[Dymchurch]] on the [[Romney Marsh]]. The surrounding countryside is home to the "Marsh Phantoms": figures on horseback who ride by night and bring terror to the village.

Captain Collier ([[Patrick Allen]]) and his band of sailors arrive in Dymchurch to investigate reports that the locals are involved in the smuggling of alcohol from France. They are accompanied by the mulatto, mute after his tongue was cut out sixteen years earlier, whom Collier saved from death and now keeps as a slave. As Collier's men ransack an [[ale house]] run by Rash ([[Martin Benson (actor)|Martin Benson]]) and his [[Ward (law)|ward]] Imogène ([[Yvonne Romain]]), the mulatto uncovers a hidden cellar. Ostensibly a varnish store, this is connected by a secret passageway to the home of coffin-maker Jeremiah Mipps ([[Michael Ripper]]), which serves as the smugglers' headquarters. The smugglers are led by the village parson Dr Blyss ([[Peter Cushing]]), whom the mulatto inexplicably attacks before being subdued by the sailors.

That night, the smugglers succeed in transporting a consignment to a nearby windmill for onward shipment, although squire's son Harry ([[Oliver Reed]]), Imogène's secret fiancé, is wounded when he is shot in the arm by the pursuing Collier. Back at the ale house, Rash kills one of the sailors to prevent the smuggling operation from being exposed. This frees the mulatto, who leaves for the churchyard to break open Clegg's grave. Collier, who spent years chasing Clegg, becomes suspicious of Blyss when the mulatto later makes a second attempt on the parson's life.

At Blyss's house, Rash finds Clegg's last will and testament. Learning that Imogène is Clegg's daughter, he angrily disowns her. While consoling Imogène, Harry is arrested by Collier when the captain notices the young man's bandaged arm. Harry is led away to Collier's ship as a hostage but escapes when the Marsh Phantoms appear, distracting the sailors. The Phantoms, who are actually villagers in disguise, take Harry and Imogène to the church, where they are hurriedly married by Blyss before leaving to start their life together.

Collier arrives at the church and announces that Clegg's grave is empty. He then tears off Blyss's collar to reveal the rope burns from an unsuccessful hanging, exposing the parson as Clegg. Clegg declares that his executioner spared his life and that he wished only to help the inhabitants of Dymchurch live comfortably. A struggle breaks out between the villagers and the sailors, enabling Clegg to flee with Mipps via the secret passageway. However, on emerging at the coffin-maker's house they run into the mulatto, who has murdered Rash and fatally impales Clegg with a spear before being shot dead by Mipps. In the film's closing scene, the villagers look on and Collier and the sailors salute as Mipps sorrowfully places Clegg's body in the open grave.

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was moderately positive, writing that the film had a "good" screenplay and "savvy" direction, "and the range of technical credits are all on the plus side, especially Arthur Grant's photography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 9, 1962 |title=Night Creatures |url= |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' was negative, writing, "The script is feeble, the acting, apart from Patrick Allen's forceful hero, uninspired, and the obsession with injury, degradation and death more dispiriting than ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=July 1962 |title=Captain Clegg |url= |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=29 |issue=342 |page=92 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chi''''' is a 2013 [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentary film by [[Anne Wheeler]] about Vancouver actress [[Babz Chula]] and her death from [[cancer]]. Part of the film was shot at an [[ayurvedic]] clinic in [[Kerala, India]], where Chula had travelled for cancer treatment in 2010.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/film-reviews/chi-up-close-and-personal-with-the-art-of-dying/article11429362/#dashboard/follows/ | title=Chi: Up close and personal with the art of dying | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] | date=19 April 2013 | accessdate=10 March 2014 | author=Adams, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leiren-Young"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Babz+Chula+lives+2013+International+Vancouver+International+Film+Festival/8959552/story.html | title=Babz Chula’s Chi lives on in 2013’s International Vancouver International Film Festival | work=[[Vancouver Sun]] | date=3 October 2013 | accessdate=10 March 2014 | author=Leiren-Young, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea to make a film about her story first occurred to Wheeler when she cast Chula, already diagnosed with cancer in real life, as a cancer patient who dispenses philosophical advice in her 2008 TV movie, ''Living Out Loud''. When Wheeler and Chula worked together again the following year on [[Carl Bessai]]'s film ''Fathers &amp; Sons'', Chula shared the story of a patient she'd met at a chemotherapy who credited her recovery to treatment in India. Wheeler, who had spent considerable time in India, decided to accompany Chula on her search for a cure.&lt;ref name="Leiren-Young" /&gt;

The film had its world premiere in April 2013 at the [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]].&lt;ref name="Adams" /&gt; On March 9, 2014, ''Chi'' was named best short documentary film at the [[2nd Canadian Screen Awards|Canadian Screen Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/2014/03/10/21522926.html | title=Enemy, Mortal Instruments dominate award show | work=QMI Agency | date=9 March 2014 | accessdate=10 March 2014 | author=Braun, Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a succession of '''Soviet secret police agencies''' over time. The first [[secret police]] after the [[October Revolution]], created by [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s decree on December 20, 1917, was called "[[Cheka]]" (ЧК). Officers were referred to as "chekists", a name that is still informally applied to people under the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security Service]] of [[Russia]], the [[KGB]]'s successor in Russia after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

For most agencies listed here secret policing operations were only part of their function; for instance, the [[KGB]] was both the secret police and the [[intelligence agency]].

== History of the Soviet state security organs ==
===Detailed chronology===
[[File:19240800-dzershinsky stalin.jpg|thumb|right|Stalin and Felix Dzerzhinsky in 1924]]

*'''[[Cheka]]''' (abbreviation of ''Vecheka'', itself an acronym for "All-Russian Extraordinary Committee to Combat Counter-Revolution and Sabotage" of the [[Russian SFSR]])
**[[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] (December 20, 1917 – July 7, 1918)
**[[Yakov Peters]] (July 7, 1918 – August 22, 1918)
**[[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] (August 22, 1918 – February 6, 1922)

February 6, 1922: Cheka transforms into GPU, a department of the NKVD of the Russian SFSR.

*'''[[NKVD]]''' – "[[People's Commissariat]] for Internal Affairs"
**'''[[State Political Directorate|GPU]]''' – State Political Directorate
***Dzerzhinsky (February 6, 1922 – November 15, 1923)

November 15, 1923: GPU leaves the NKVD and becomes all-union OGPU under direct control of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the USSR.

*'''[[State Political Directorate|OGPU]]''' – "Joint State Political Directorate" or "All-Union State Political Board"
**Dzerzhinsky (November 15, 1923 – July 20, 1926)
**[[Vyacheslav Menzhinsky]] (July 30, 1926 – May 10, 1934)

July 10, 1934: NKVD of the Russian SFSR ceases to exist and transforms into the all-union NKVD of the USSR; OGPU becomes [[GUGB]] ("Main Directorate for State Security") in the all-union NKVD.

*'''[[NKVD]]''' – "People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs"
**'''[[Main Directorate of State Security|GUGB]]''' – "Main Directorate for State Security"
***[[Genrikh Yagoda]] (July 10, 1934 – September 26, 1936)
***[[Nikolai Yezhov]] (September 26, 1936 – November 25, 1938)
***[[Lavrentiy Beria]] (November, 1938 – February 3, 1941)

February 3, 1941: The GUGB of the NKVD was briefly separated out into the NKGB, then merged back in, and then on April 14, 1943 separated out again.

*'''[[People's Commissariat for State Security|NKGB]]''' – "People's Commissariat for State Security"
**[[Vsevolod Nikolayevich Merkulov|Vsevolod Merkulov]] (February 3, 1941 – July 20, 1941) (NKGB folded back into NKVD)
*'''[[NKVD]]''' – "People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs"
**'''[[Main Directorate of State Security|GUGB]]''' – "Main Directorate for State Security"
***[[Lavrentiy Beria]] (July 20, 1941 – April 14, 1943)
*'''[[People's Commissariat for State Security|NKGB]]''' – "People's Commissariat for State Security"
**Vsevolod Merkulov (April 14, 1943 – March 18, 1946) (NKGB reseparated from NKVD)

March 18, 1946: All [[People's Commissariat]]s were renamed to [[Ministry (government department)|Ministries]].

*'''[[Ministry of State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]]''' – "Ministry of State Security"
**[[Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov|Viktor Abakumov]] (March 18, 1946 – 1951)
**[[Semyon Ignatyev]] (1951 – March 5, 1953)

The [[East Germany|East German]] secret police, the [[Stasi]], took their name from this iteration.

*'''[[KI (Soviet intelligence service)|KI]]''' – "Committee of Information" (foreign intelligence service)&lt;ref&gt;[[Svetlana Chervonnaya]], KI briefing from the Russian side, H-HOAC Discussion, 17 March 2005.

**[[Peter Fedotov]] [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]]
**[[Fedor Kuznetsov]] [[GRU]]
**[[Yakov Malik]] [[Foreign Ministry]]

May 30, 1947: Official decision with the expressed purpose of "upgrading coordination of different intelligence services and concentrating their efforts on major directions". In the summer of 1948 the military personnel in KI were returned to the [[Soviet military]] to reconstitute foreign military intelligence service ([[GRU]]). KI sections dealing with the new [[East Bloc]] and Soviet émigrés were returned to the MGB in late 1948. In 1951 the KI returned to the MGB.

March 5, 1953: MVD and MGB are merged into the MVD by [[Lavrentiy Beria]].

*'''[[MVD]]''' – "Ministry of Internal Affairs"
**Lavrentiy Beria (March 5, 1953 – June 26, 1953)
**[[Sergei Kruglov (politician)|Sergei Kruglov]] (June, 1953 – March 13, 1954)

[[File:KGB first law.jpg|thumb|right|The 1954 [[ukase]] establishing the KGB.]]
March 13, 1954: Newly independent force became the [[KGB]], as Beria was purged and the MVD divested itself again of the functions of secret policing. After renamings and tumults, the KGB remained stable until 1991.

*'''[[KGB]]''' – Committee for State Security
**[[Ivan Serov]] (March 13, 1954 – December 8, 1958)
**[[Alexander Shelepin]] (December 25, 1958 – November 13, 1961)
**[[Vladimir Semichastny]] (November 13, 1961 – May 18, 1967)
**[[Yuri Andropov]] (May 18, 1967 – May 26, 1982)
**[[Vitaly Fedorchuk]] (May 26, 1982 – December 17, 1982)
**[[Viktor Chebrikov]] (December 17, 1982 – October 1, 1988)
**[[Vladimir Kryuchkov]] (October 1, 1988 – August 22, 1991)
**[[Leonid Shebarshin]] (August 22, 1991 – August 23, 1991) (acting)
**[[Vadim Bakatin]] (August 23, 1991 – October 22, 1991)

In 1991, after the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|State Emergency Committee]] failed to overthrow [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] and [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]] took over, General [[Vadim Bakatin]] was given instructions to dissolve the KGB.

In Russia today, KGB functions are performed by the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)]], the [[Federal Security Service]] of the Russian Federation (FSB), and the [[Federal Protective Service (Russia)|Federal Protective Service (FSO)]]. The [[Main Intelligence Directorate|GRU]] continues to operate as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1051">'''Cognitive adequacy''' is a term proposed by [[Rein Raud]] as a standard of judging [[Bandwagon effect|cultural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meaning in Action: Outline of an Integral Theory of Culture|last=Raud|first=Rein|publisher=Polity Books|year=2016|isbn=9781509511242|location=Cambridge|pages=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this method, a cultural phenomenon is cognitively adequate if it provides the means of solving certain problems in a certain [[Social environment|socio-cultural context]]. This is true even when that solution is, according to other criteria, wrong. For example, before the [[Great Depression]] in the US many people thought that it is cognitively adequate to think of getting rich quickly through [[land speculation]]. All cultural phenomena are replaced by others when they are no longer cognitively adequate. For example, when a community has embraced a new religion, or when science has displaced religion as the primary explanatory discourse for their world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3124">The '''Conservation Center for Art &amp; Historic Artifacts''' (CCAHA), located in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], was founded by Marilyn Kemp Weidner in 1977, with funding from the [http://www.neh.gov/ National Endowment for the Humanities] and in response to the growing problem of paper deterioration occurring in archives in the Mid-Atlantic region.&lt;ref&gt;http://ccaha.org/about/news/2017/01/13/ccaha-s-40th-soul-of-the-new-center&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently one of the largest nonprofit paper conservation facilities in the country, CCAHA specializes in the treatment of art and historic artifacts on paper, including drawings, prints, maps, posters, historic wallpaper, photographs, books, scrapbooks, and manuscripts, as well as related materials like parchment and papyrus.&lt;ref&gt;http://ccaha.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rap-arcc.org/index.php?page=members&amp;members_req=3&lt;/ref&gt; CCAHA serves cultural, research, and educational institutions, such as museums, libraries, archives, and historical societies, both in its region and across the country. It also works with individuals and private organizations.

Treatments include [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s original lyric notebooks and scrapbooks,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccaha.org/uploads/media_items/experts-restore-a-river-of-the-boss-ephemera.original.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s architectural drawings, [[John James Audubon]] ''Birds of America'' prints,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccaha.org/uploads/media_items/baltimore-sun-article-october-2006.original.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Civil War muster rolls, and works by [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]. CCAHA was instrumental in the 2014 discovery of two previously-unknown Cézanne sketches belonging to the [[Barnes Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/arts/design/two-new-cezanne-works-discovered-by-barnes-foundation-museum.html?_r=1&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CCAHAStaff drying.jpg|thumb|CCAHA’s conservation staff laying out fire, water, and mold damaged items to dry.]]
In addition to treatment services, CCAHA offers nationwide educational programs on [[Disaster Recovery Plan|disaster planning]], collections care, and records and archives management.&lt;ref&gt;http://ccaha.org/education/program-calendar&lt;/ref&gt; These lectures, seminars, and workshops are designed for professional staff who have primary responsibility for the care and handling of artifacts, such as curators, collections managers, archivists, and librarians.

Other services include digital imaging, conservation matting and framing, on-site consultations, emergency conservation services and disaster assistance,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/when-disaster-strikes-museums-call-in-the-ateam&lt;/ref&gt; and help with grantwriting&lt;ref&gt;http://ccaha.org/fundraising&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibition planning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12819">[[File:PleyelGrandModeleDeConcert.JPG|thumb|300px|The harpsichordist [[Wanda Landowska]] was a key figure in the 20th-century revival of the harpsichord.  Her instrument of choice was a (then) modern design, the [[Pleyel]] "Grand Modèle de Concert".]]
The [[harpsichord]] was largely obsolete, and seldom played, during a period lasting from the late 18th century to the early 20th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ukpianos.co.uk/harpsichord-history.html | title=Harpsichord History | accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument was successfully revived during the 20th century, first in an [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]] form strongly influenced by the piano, then with historically more faithful instruments. The revival was the joint work of performers, builders, and composers who wrote new harpsichord pieces. However the harpsichord never completely disappeared from the public eye as it was used through the mid-19th century for basso continuendo because despite its low volume, it had considerable power to "cut through" the orchestra. The earliest revival efforts began in the mid-19th century due to its increasingly infrequent usage and there was concern that the instrument could become a forgotten relic of the past.

==Instruments==
[[File:Clavecin 1979.JPG|thumb|300px|A heavy-framed mid-century harpsichord by the Sperrhake firm. Such instruments were harshly criticized during the 1960s by [[Wolfgang Zuckermann|Zuckermann]], who described their sound as feeble and their appearance as tubby, a betrayal of the tradition of beauty seen in historical instruments.]]
[[File:Deless-10.jpg|thumb|300px|Harpsichords played today tend to follow closely the building practices established in the historical period. This modern instrument was built by Jean-Paul Rouaud based on a historical instrument made in 1707 by Nicolas Dumont.]]
In the earlier stages, 20th-century harpsichords were heavily influenced by the technology of the modern piano, and usually included metal framing (which was entirely absent in historical instruments). It was felt that such construction would increase the stability of tuning. Since heavy framing tends to stifle harpsichord sound, instruments were bolstered by other means, notably the addition of a [[Eight foot pitch|16']] stop (an additional set of strings that played an octave below normal pitch); such stops were somewhat unusual in the historical period but became widespread in the first half of the 20th century. An example was the harpsichord produced by [[Pleyel et Cie]] at the request of Landowska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.harpsichord.org.uk/EH/Vol2/No5/pleyel.pdf | title=The Pleyel Harpsichord | last=Richard | first=J.A. | publisher=The British Harpsichord Society | year=1979 | accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the mid-20th century, instruments were introduced whose construction followed historical principles, with thinner cases, historical dispositions (arrangements of choirs of strings) and no metal framing. Among the leaders of this shift were [[Frank Hubbard]], [[William Dowd]], and [[Martin Skowroneck]]. With time, such instruments came to dominate the scene, and the older heavy-frame instruments are almost never manufactured today. They retain historical value, however, since they were the instruments that early to mid-20th-century composers had in mind when they wrote their works.&lt;ref&gt;Thus the [[Neupert]] firm still offers its mid-century "Bach" model for sale, defending it explicitly on the grounds of its suitability for 20th-century music ([http://www.jc-neupert.de/en/node/48]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition of harpsichord building toward historicist principles is covered in detail by Hubbard (1965), Zuckermann (1969), and Kottick (2003), cited below.

==Music written for the contemporary harpsichord==

===Classical music===
In the 20th century, classical composers returned to the harpsichord as they sought out variation in the sounds available to them. Under the influence of [[Arnold Dolmetsch]], the [[harpsichordist]]s [[Violet Gordon-Woodhouse]] (1872–1951) and in France, [[Wanda Landowska]] (1879–1959), were at the forefront of the instrument's renaissance.

[[Harpsichord concerto|Concertos]] for the instrument were written by [[Francis Poulenc]] (the ''[[Concert champêtre]]'', 1927–28), [[Manuel de Falla]], [[Walter Leigh]], [[Bertold Hummel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bertoldhummel.de/english/register/register.html Bertold Hummel list of works]: Op. 15 is his ''Divertimento capriccioso'' for harpsichord and chamber orchestra.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henryk Mikołaj Górecki]], [[Michael Nyman]], [[Philip Glass]] and [[Viktor Kalabis]]. [[Bohuslav Martinů]] wrote both a [[concerto]] and a [[sonata (music)|sonata]] for the instrument, and [[Elliott Carter]]'s ''Double Concerto'' is scored for harpsichord, piano and two chamber [[orchestra]]s. The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] composer [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]] also wrote a harpsichord concerto for chamber ensemble (1951), and the instrument featured in one of his most famous works, ''[[Petite Symphonie Concertante]]''. 

In chamber music, [[György Ligeti]] wrote a small number of solo works for the instrument (including ''[[Continuum (Ligeti)|Continuum]]''), and [[Henri Dutilleux]]'s ''Les Citations'' (1991) is scored for harpsichord, oboe, double bass and percussions. [[Elliott Carter]]'s ''Sonata for Flute, Oboe, Cello and Harpsichord'' (1952) and his ''Double Concerto For Piano, Harpsichord, and Two Chamber Orchestras'' (1961) explore the timbre possibilities of the modern harpsichord.

[[Iannis Xenakis]] is also one of the composers who have written for harpsichord, with works like ''A l'lle de Gorée'' for amplified harpsichord and chamber orchestra, ''Komboi'' and ''Oophaa'' for harpsichord (again amplified) and percussion, and the two solo works ''Khoai'' and ''Naama''.

[[Josef Tal]] wrote ''Concerto for harpsichord &amp; electronic music'' (1964), ''Three Compositions for recorder &amp; harpsichord'' (1966) and ''Chamber Music'' (1982) for s-recorder, marimba &amp; harpsichord. Both [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] (''Hamlet'', 1964) and [[Alfred Schnittke]] (''Symphony No.8'', 1994) wrote works that use the harpsichord as part of the orchestral texture. [[John Cage]] and [[Lejaren Hiller]] wrote ''[[HPSCHD]]'' (1969) for 1-7 harpsichords and 1-51 computer-generated tapes. [[John Zorn]] has also used harpsichord in works like ''Rituals'' (1998), ''Contes de Fées'' (1999), and ''La Machine de l'Etre'' (2000).

In the Preface to his piano collection ''[[Mikrokosmos (Bartók)|Mikrokosmos]]'', [[Béla Bartók]] suggests some ten pieces as being suitable for the harpsichord.

American composer [[Vincent Persichetti]] composed a number of sonatas for the harpsichord. 

[[Benjamin Britten]] included harpsichord parts in his opera ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and his [[cantata]] ''[[Phaedra (cantata)|Phaedra]]''.

Harpsichordist [[Hendrik Bouman]] has composed pieces in the 17th- and 18th-century style, including works for solo harpsichord, harpsichord concerti, and other works that call for harpsichord continuo. Other contemporary composers writing new harpsichord music in period styles include [[Grant Colburn]], and [[Fernando De Luca]]. Notable performers include [[Oscar Milani]] and [[Mario Raskin]].

Works for harpsichord in the 21st century include Northern Irish composer Alan Mills's ''Two Cubist Inventions'' (2000 / 2013)&lt;ref&gt;Two Cubist Inventions (no date) Available at: http://www.musichaven.co.uk/Two-Cubist-Inventions.html (Accessed: 13 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and French composer Karol Beffa's ''Suite'' (2008), ''Sarabande et Doubles'' (2015) and 'Destroy'' (2007) for harpsichord and string quartet.

===Folk music===
[[Seán Ó Riada]] used the harpsichord both for the soundtracks of film music, and for interpretations of the Irish harper [[Turlough O'Carolan]] during Riada's work with the band [[Ceoltori Cualann]] (later to become [[The Chieftains]]). Riada used harpsichord for the latter with the justification that the harpsichord best replicated the sound of the metal strings of the early [[Irish harp]].&lt;ref name="CooperDawe2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Cooper|author2=Kevin Dawe|title=The Mediterranean in Music: Critical Perspectives, Common Concerns, Cultural Differences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Di1KQc6-HCwC&amp;pg=PA220|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5407-9|pages=220–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Love2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy Mason Love|title=The Film Music of Sean O Riada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zq2J4F7cAXIC&amp;pg=PA66|year=2009|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-1-109-20305-9|pages=66–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular music===
The revival of the harpsichord spilled over into [[popular music]]. Its first appearance in [[jazz music]] happened around 1940, when pianist [[Johnny Guarnieri]] was asked to play a harpsichord in [[Artie Shaw]]'s [[quintet]] "[[Gramercy Five]]".&lt;ref name="berindei"&gt;Berindei, Mihai (1976). ''Jazz Dictionary'', Scientific and Encyclopedic Publishing House, Bucharest, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The band recorded eight albums between 1940 and 1945, which were reissued in 1990 (''The Complete Gramercy Sessions'').

In the 1960s and 1970s, the harpsichord was used by groups including [[The Beatles]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[The Kinks]], [[The Monkees]], [[The Partridge Family]], [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]], and [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]]. A great number of other artists since then have used harpsichord in their work such as [[Jens Johansson]] from [[Stratovarius]].

The harpsichord also appeared in film and on television.  For example, it appeared on the television show ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', played by [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]]. It appeared in the 1960s [[Miss Marple]] films featuring [[Margaret Rutherford]] and the cult show ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

[[Boys for Pele]], the third album of American singer-songwriter [[Tori Amos]], is notable for featuring the harpsichord as the main instrument on several songs, including the lead single [[Caught a Lite Sneeze|Caught A Lite Sneeze]].

{{Missing information|the history of the subject. In particular, nothing is said about dream sequences in literature, and only one sentence addresses anything other than film|date=September 2016}}
A '''dream sequence''' is a technique used in [[storytelling]], particularly in television and film, to set apart a brief interlude from the main story. The interlude may consist of a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], a [[flashforward]], a [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]], a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]], a [[dream]], or some other element.

==Purposes==
Commonly, dream sequences appear in many films to shed light on the psychical process of the dreaming character or give the audience a glimpse into the character's past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Montgomery |first= Mark |date=December 2010 |title= Dreaming Up Dream Sequences |journal= Videomaker |pages= 57–59 |url = http://www.videomaker.com/article/14611/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance in ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'', the purpose of Pee-wee's dreams is to inform the audience of his anxieties and fears after losing his bike.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Other times major action takes place in dreams, allowing the filmmaker to explore infinite possibilities, as [[Michel Gondry]] demonstrates in ''[[The Science of Sleep]]''. Harvard psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] points out in the book ''The Committee of Sleep'' that, while the main content of dream sequences is determined by the film's overall plot, visual details often reflect the individual dream experience of the screenwriter or director. For Hitchcock's ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'', [[Salvador Dalí]] designed sharply angled sets inspired by his own dream space. [[Ingmar Bergman]] lit dream sequences in several films with a harsh glare of light which he says reflects his own nightmares (though most people's have dim light), and [[Orson Welles]] designed a scene of [[The Trial (1962 film)|''The Trial'']] to reflect the manner in which architecture constantly changed in his dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Barrett |first1= Deidre | authorlink1 = Deirdre Barrett |title= The Committee of Sleep: How Artists, Scientists, and Athletes Use Dreams for Creative Problem-Solving—and How You Can Too |chapter= Chapter 2: Dreams that Money Can Buy |year= 2010 |origyear= 2001 |publisher= Oneiroi Press| isbn=0982869509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films normally present dreams as a visually accessible or objectively observed space, a discrete environment in which characters exist and interact as they do in the world rather than restricting themselves to the subjective point of view a dream is normally experienced from in real life.&lt;ref name="altworlds"&gt;{{cite book |title= Alternative Worlds in Hollywood Cinema |last= Walters |first= James |chapter= Chapter 2 |year= 2008 |publisher= Intellect Books |location= Chicago |isbn= 1841502022}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way films succeed in presenting a coherent dreamed world alongside the [[Diegesis#In film|diegetic reality]] of the film. Via transition from one to the next, a film establishes not only the boundaries but resonances between the two worlds. These resonances can reveal a character's subjective observations or desires without breaking away from the objective viewpoint of the narrator, camera, or director with which some theorist, such as [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]], believe the viewer identifies.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Metz |first1= Christian |authorlink1= Christian Metz (critic) |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |coauthors= |editor1-first= Leo |editor1-last= Braudy | editor2-first = Marshall | editor2-last = Cohen  |title= Film Theory and Criticism: Introductory Readings |edition= 6th |year= 1999  |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= New York |isbn= 0195105982  |pages= 800–808 |chapter= Identification, Mirror (from ''The Imaginary Signifier'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively]] explain past plot elements as a dream sequence in order to maintain a plausible [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in continuing fiction, such as a television series. Such was the case with ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', which had killed off [[Bobby Ewing]], one of the more popular characters on the show; when the show's writers decided to bring Bobby back to the show, the [[Dallas (season 10)|tenth-season]] premiere "Return to Camelot" revealed that the events between Bobby's death and the end of season nine were all part of a nightmare his wife was having.

==Techniques==
Audio or visual elements, such as distinctive music or coloration, are frequently used to signify the beginning and end of a dream sequence in film. It has also become commonplace to distinguish a dream sequence from the rest of the film by showing a shot of a person in bed sleeping or about to go to sleep. Other films show a dream sequence followed by a character waking up in their own bed, such as the dream sequence [[George Gershwin]] composed for his film score to ''[[Delicious (film)|Delicious]]''. In classic Hollywood, the wavy [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolve]] was the standard way to transition between reality and a dream; there would be a close-up of the character having the dream, which would begin shimmering as we crossed over from reality to fantasy.&lt;ref name="transitions"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Morton |first= Ray |date=September–October 2011 |title= Transitions |journal= Script |volume= 17 |issue= 5 |pages=68–70 |issn= 1092-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common contemporary transitions into a fantasy is to zoom in on a character's face and then spin around to the back of that character to reveal that he/she is now standing in an alternate reality.&lt;ref name="transitions"/&gt; Perhaps the most common technique today is the post-reveal in which a character is shown in an awkward or unusual situation, the scene builds to an even more absurd or unusual situation, and then suddenly there is a cut to the character waking up,&lt;ref name="transitions"/&gt;  as exemplified by the opening sequence of ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'' where a [[pep rally]] with irreverent routines builds into an abnormal moment where a character is revealed topless; she then wakes up to the viewers' realization that she had been dreaming.

This is akin to the technique wherein a dream sequence is a [[plot device]] in which an entire story has been revealed to be a dream. As opposed to a segment of an otherwise real scenario, in these cases it is revealed that everything depicted was unreal. Often this is used to explain away otherwise inexplicable events. Because it has been done in many occasions to resolve a storyline that seemed out of place or unexpected, it is often considered weak storytelling; a particularly referenced example of this is the TV show ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' in which the entirety of season 9 was revealed after the fact to have been a dream. Furthermore, in-jokes are often made in writing (particularly television scripts) that refer to the disappointment a viewer might feel in finding out everything they have watched was a dream. For example, entire sequences of the ''[[Family Guy]]'' two-part episode [[Stewie Kills Lois and Lois Kills Stewie|"Stewie Kills Lois" and "Lois Kills Stewie"]] are revealed to have taken place within a virtual reality simulation, upon which a character asks whether a potential viewer could be angry that they have effectively watched a dream sequence, but this technique can also be effective and its use lauded when the status of dream or reality is left more ambiguous as it was in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref name="dreamvision"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Rabin |first= Staton |date=July–August 2011 |title= Dream, Vision or Fantasy? |journal= Script |volume= 17 |issue= 4 |pages=66–68 |issn= 1092-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[camera angle]]s and movements used to depict dream sequences enable this kind of play and confusion between the diegetic reality and the dreamed world by presenting the dream world as a visually accessible space in which the character moves around the same as he does in the diegetic reality, as opposed to restricting themselves cinematographically to a [[subjective viewpoint]] even though dreams are generally understood to be experienced by the dreamer from their own subjective point of view.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; This point is made salient by the films which choose to employ first-person camera angles such as ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'' (1995) when it depicts recorded memories experienced via the "SQUID" recorder, the first-person sequence of ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' (2005), the beginning of ''[[Enter the Void]]'' (2010), and others, and how radically these moments stand out against normal cinematography even when the subject matter is something as subjective as a dream. Many have cited the general impracticality and unattractiveness of sustained first-person perspective in film as a reason for its absence from filmed dream sequences.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:LifeOfAnAmericanFiremanqq01 12 56qq00013.jpg|thumb|A dream sequence in ''Life of an American Fireman'' (1903)]]
The dream sequence that Atossa narrates near the beginning of [[Aeschylus]]' Athenian tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'' (472 BCE) may be the first in the history of European theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Taxidou |first1= Olga |title= Tragedy, Modernity and Mourning |year= 2004 |month= |origyear= |publisher= [[Edinburgh University Press]] |location= [[Edinburgh]] |isbn= 0748619879 |page= 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first dream sequence in a film is more contested.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; Film critic [[Bob Mondello]] claims that the first famous movie with a dream sequence was [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'' (1924).&lt;ref name="dreamvision"/&gt; Predating this, Leslie Halpern claims that the earliest dream sequence was in [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]]'s ''[[Life of an American Fireman]]'' (1903).&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; Earlier than either of these, James Walters points out [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|G.A. Smith]]'s use of a dream sequence in ''[[Let Me Dream Again]]'' (1900), but is careful to note the precariousness of claiming any film the first to feature dream sequence given the rapid transnational development of cinema in its early years and that so many films from the period have been lost.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt;

Walters traces the dream sequence technique of revealing one thing to be another (revealing what the audience thought was a dream to actually be reality), back to [[magic lantern (projector)|magic lantern]] shows features "slipping" or "slipper" slides in which; some lantern slides for examples would feature two sheets of glass with different images painted on each, say a cocoon and a butterfly. The first sheet would be projected and then the second sheet slid on top of it to reveal a change, such as a butterfly emerging from a cocoon.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; Dream sequences became very popular in the early period of film following this change of phase format.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; Alongside this technique, a dream sequence which is introduced by a character falling asleep and then entering the dream sequence also became popular via such films as [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]]'s ''[[Dream of the Rarebit Fiend]]'' (1906).&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt; What is important to note is these films created a model for dream sequences in which a character's inner thoughts are not represented subjectively (from the character's point of view), but from an objective camera angle that gives the audience the impression less of a character having a dream than of being transported alongside the character into a dreamed world in which the character's actions are captured by the camera in the same way they are the films' real fictional worlds.&lt;ref name="altworlds"/&gt;

'''Es-Skhul''' ({{lang-ar|السخول}}, meaning kid, young goat) is a [[prehistoric]] [[cave]] site situated {{convert|20 |km|mi|1|abbr=on}} south of the city of [[Haifa]], [[Israel]], and around {{convert|3 |km|mi|1|abbr=on}} from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The  site was first excavated by [[Dorothy Garrod]] during summer of 1928. The excavation revealed the first evidence of the late [[Epipaleolithic]] [[Natufian]] culture, characterized by the presence of numerous [[microlith]] stone tools, human burials and ground stone tools. Skhul also represents an area where [[Neanderthal]]s - possibly present in the region from 200,000 to 45,000 years ago - may have lived alongside these humans dating to 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, S. &lt;u&gt;Mapping Human History.&lt;/u&gt; Houghton Mifflin, New York (2003). p.74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; The cave also has Middle [[Palaeolithic]] layers.

The remains found at Es Skhul, together with those found at the [[Wadi el-Mughara Caves]] and [[Mugharet el-Zuttiyeh]] were classified in 1939 by [[Arthur Keith]] and [[:de:Theodore D. McCown|Theodore D. McCown]] as ''Palaeoanthropus palestinensis'', a descendent of ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vHKuxy69Lc8C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59 The Palaeolithic Origins of Human Burial], [[Paul Pettitt]], 2013, p59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kl8gAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Human Adaptation in the Asian Palaeolithic: Hominin Dispersal and Behaviour during the Late Quaternary], Ryan J.

[[File:Scary Clowns at PDC2008 Party at Universal Studios (cropped).jpg|thumb|A group of people in evil clown costumes at a [[PDC 2008]] party at [[Universal Studios]]]]
The '''evil clown''' is a subversion of the traditional comic [[clown]] character, in which the playful trope is instead rendered as disturbing through the use of [[Horror and terror|horror]] elements and [[dark humor]]. The modern archetype of the evil clown was popularized by [[Stephen King]]'s 1986 novel ''[[It (novel)|It]]''. The character can be seen as playing off the sense of unease felt by sufferers of '''coulrophobia''', the [[phobia|fear]] of clowns.

==Origins==
[[File:Enrico Caruso As Canio.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Enrico Caruso]] as the murderous Canio in ''[[Pagliacci]]'']]
The modern archetype of the evil clown has unclear origins; the stock character appeared infrequently during the 19th century, in such works as [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[Hop-Frog]]",&lt;ref name="hopfrog"&gt;[[s:Hop-Frog|Poe, Edgar Allan, ''"Hop-Frog"'' (1849)]]&lt;/ref&gt; which is believed by Jack Morgan, of the [[University of Missouri-Rolla]], to draw upon an [[Bal des Ardents|earlier incident]] "at a masquerade ball", in the 14th century, during which "the king and his frivolous party, costumed—in highly flammable materials—as simian creatures, were ignited by a flambeau and incinerated, the King narrowly escaping in the actual case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Jack|title=The biology of horror: gothic literature and film|year=2002|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale|isbn=978-0809324712|pages=41–42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yk-0SmCIZ_kC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evil clowns also occupied a small niche in drama, appearing in the 1874 work ''La femme de Tabarin'' by Catulle Mendès and in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]'' (accused of being a plagiarism of Mendès' piece), both works featuring murderous clowns as central characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mendès|first=Catulle|title=La femme de Tabarin: Tragi-parade|year=1904|publisher=Librairie Charpentier et Fasquelle |pages=1–34|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/La_femme_de_Tabarin.html?id=pUcESQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dryden|first=Konrad|title=Leoncavallo: Life and Works|year=2007|publisher=The Scarecrow Press|location=Plymouth, UK|isbn=978-0-8108-5880-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s the ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' published a series of mock comic books in the pages of the magazine, entitled "Evil Clown", which featured a malevolent titular character named [[Frenchy the Clown]]. During that decade, American [[serial killer]] and [[rape|rapist]] [[John Wayne Gacy]] became known as the ''Killer Clown'' when arrested in 1978, after it was discovered he had performed as Pogo the Clown at children's parties and other events; however, Gacy did not actually commit his crimes while wearing his clown costume.&lt;ref name="gacy"&gt;{{cite book |first=Terry |last=Sullivan |first2=Peter T. |last2=Maiken |title=Killer Clown: The John Wayne Gacy Murders| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Pyrotechnic_Insanitarium.html?id=u71s2gNZqJoC | publisher=[[Kensington Books#Imprints|Pinnacle]] | location=[[New York City]] | year=2000 | isbn= 0-7860-1422-9| oclc = 156783287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern stock character of the evil clown was popularized by [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[It (novel)|It]]'', published in 1986, which introduced the fear of an evil clown to a modern audience. In the novel, the [[It (character)|eponymous character]] is a pan-dimensional monster which feeds mainly on children by luring them in the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown and then assuming the shape of whatever the victim fears the most.

The evil clown archetype plays strongly off the sense of dislike it caused to inherent elements of coulrophobia; however, it has been suggested by Joseph Durwin&lt;ref name="trickster"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Durwin| first=Joseph| title=Coulrophobia and the Trickster| journal=Trickster's Way| volume=3| issue=1| id=Article 4| publisher=Trinity University| location=San Antonio| date=15 November 2004| url=http://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=trickstersway&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.co.uk%2Fscholar%3Fstart%3D20%26q%3Devil%2Bclown%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%2C5| issn=1538-9030| accessdate=2 January 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; that the concept of evil clowns has an independent position in popular culture, arguing that "the concept of evil clowns and the widespread hostility it induces is a cultural phenomenon which transcends just the phobia alone". A study by the [[University of Sheffield]] concluded "that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7189401.stm |title=Health &amp;#124; Hospital clown images 'too scary' |publisher=BBC News |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Why scary"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=16 January 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7191721.stm|title=Why are clowns scary?|first=Finlo|last=Rohrer}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be because of the nature of clowns' makeup hiding their faces, making them potential threats in disguise; as a psychology professor at [[California State University, Northridge]] stated, young children are "very reactive to a familiar body type with an unfamiliar face".&lt;ref name="trinity"/&gt; This natural dislike of clowns makes them effective in a literary or fictional context, as the antagonistic threat perceived in clowns is desirable in a villainous character.

Researcher [[Ben Radford]], who published ''Bad Clowns''&lt;ref name="Bad Clowns"/&gt; in 2016 and is regarded as an expert on the phenomenon,&lt;ref name="kob4"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shone|first1=Colton|title=Recent scary clown trend nothing new, expert said|url=http://www.kob.com/albuquerque-news/recent-scary-clown-trend-nothing-new-expert-benjamin-radford-bad-clowns-author-book-creepy/4291893/?cat=500|website=KOB 4|accessdate=20 October 2016|authorlink=Ben Radford|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018190315/http://www.kob.com/albuquerque-news/recent-scary-clown-trend-nothing-new-expert-benjamin-radford-bad-clowns-author-book-creepy/4291893/?cat=500|archivedate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that looking throughout history clowns are seen as trickers, fools, and more; however, they always are in control, speak their minds, and can get away with doing so. When writing the book ''Bad Clowns'', Radford found that professional clowns are not generally fond of the bad-clown (or evil-clown) persona. They see them as "the rotten apple in the barrel, whose ugly sight and smell casts suspicion on the rest of them," and do not wish to encourage or propagate coulrophobia. Yet, as Radford discovered, bad clowns have existed throughout history: [[Harlequin]], the King's fool, and Mr. Punch. Radford argues that bad clowns have the "ability to change with the times" and that modern bad clowns have evolved into Internet trolls. They may not wear clown costume but, nevertheless, engage with people for their own amusement, abuse, tease and speak what they think of as the "truth" much like the court jester and "dip clowns" do using "human foibles" against their victims. Radford states that, although bad clowns permeate the media in movies, TV, music, comics, and more, the "good clowns" outnumber the bad ones. Research shows that most people do not fear clowns but actually love them and that bad clowns are "the exception, not the rule."&lt;ref name="Bad Clowns"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|authorlink=Ben Radford|title=Bad Clowns|date=2016|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=978-0-8263-5666-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[File:Scary clown.jpg|thumb|Generic "evil clown" makeup]]
The concept of the evil clown is related to the irrational fear of clowns, known as '''coulrophobia''', a [[neologism]] coined in the context of informal "[[List of phobias|''-phobia'' lists]]".&lt;ref&gt;The term is listed by  the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'' ({{OEtymD|coulrophobia}}) with the caveat that it "looks suspiciously like the sort of thing idle pseudo-intellectuals invent on the Internet and which every smarty-pants takes up thereafter". The prefix ''coulro-'' is "said to be built from Greek ''kolon'' 'limb,' with some supposed sense of 'stilt-walker,' hence 'clown'" (i.e. Greek {{lang|grc|κωλοβαθριστής}} ''kolobathristes'' "stilt-walker").
Probably coined no earlier than the late 1980s but no later than the 1990s, the term  "has been coined more on the Internet than in printed form because it does not appear in any previously published, psychiatric, unabridged, or abridged dictionary."   (Robertson 2003:62)
The ''Oxford Dictionary of English'' adopted the term in 2010, also deriving it from ''kolobatheron'' "stilt" ({{citation|editor-last=Stevenson |editor-first=Angus |contribution=coulrophobia noun |title=Oxford Dictionary of English |year=2010 |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press |contribution-url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t140.e0183900 |format={{ODNBsub}} |accessdate=14 March 2011}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural critic [[Mark Dery]] has theorized the [[postmodern]] [[archetype]] of the evil clown in "Cotton Candy Autopsy: Deconstructing Psycho-Killer Clowns" (a chapter in his cultural critique ''The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium: American Culture on the Brink'').&lt;ref name="insanitarium"&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Dery | title=The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium: American Culture on the Brink| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Pyrotechnic_Insanitarium.html?id=u71s2gNZqJoC | publisher=[[Grove Press]] | location=[[California]] | year=1999 | isbn= 0-8021-3670-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracking the image of the demented or deviant clown across [[popular culture]], Dery analyzes the "Pogo the Clown" persona of the [[serial killer]] [[John Wayne Gacy]]; the obscene clowns of the neo-[[Situationist International|situationist]] [[Cacophony Society]]; the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] (of ''[[Batman]]'' fame); the grotesque art of R.K. Sloane; the sick-funny [[Bobcat Goldthwaite]] comedy ''[[Shakes the Clown]]''; Scooby Doo's Ghost Clown from the episode "Circus Clowns"; and [[It (character)|Pennywise the Dancing Clown]] from [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (novel)|It]]''.

Using [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s theory of the carnivalesque, [[Analytical Psychology|Jungian]] and historical writings on the images of the fool in myth and history, and ruminations on the mingling of ecstasy and dread in the [[Information Age]], Dery asserts the evil clown is an icon of our times. Clowns are often depicted as murderous [[psychopath]]s at many American [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted houses]].

Wolfgang M. Zucker points out the similarities between a clown's appearance and the cultural depictions of demons and other infernal creatures, noting "[the clown's] chalk-white face in which the eyes almost disappear, while the mouth is enlarged
to a ghoulish bigness looks like the mask of death".&lt;ref name="wolfgang"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ttj.sagepub.com/content/24/3/306.short|title=The Clown as the Lord of Disorder|work=Theology Today, October 1967|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to psychology professor Joseph Durwin at [[California State University, Northridge]], young children are "very reactive to a familiar body type with an unfamiliar face".&lt;ref name="trinity"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Joseph|last1=Durwin|url=http://www.trinity.edu/org/tricksters/trixway/current/Vol%203/Vol3_1/Durwin.htm |title=Coulrophobia &amp; The Trickster |publisher=Trinity.edu |accessdate=2011-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624001158/http://www.trinity.edu/org/tricksters/trixway/current/Vol%203/Vol3_1/Durwin.htm |archivedate=2011-06-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers who have studied the phobia believe there is some correlation to the [[uncanny valley]] effect.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Additionally, clown behavior is often "transgressive" ([[anti-social behavior]]) which can create feelings of unease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/08/06/209494071/fear-of-clowns-yes-its-real|title=Fear Of Clowns: Yes, It's Real|work=npr.org|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bad clowns===
Researcher [[Ben Radford]], looking at the phenomenon of bad clowns throughout history, writes that clowns are seen as trickers, fools, and more; however, they always are in control, speak their minds, and can get away with doing so. When writing the book ''Bad Clowns'', Radford found that professional clowns are not generally fond of the bad-clown persona. They see them as "the rotten apple in the barrel, whose ugly sight and smell casts suspicion on the rest of them," and do not wish to encourage or propagate coulrophobia. Yet, as Radford discovered, bad clowns have existed throughout history: Harlequin, the King's fool, and Mr. Punch. Radford argues that bad clowns have the "ability to change with the times" and that modern bad clowns have evolved into Internet trolls. They may not wear clown costume but, nevertheless, engage with people for their own amusement, abuse, tease and speak what they think of as the "truth" much like the court jester and "dip clowns" do using "human foibles" against their victims. Radford states that, although bad clowns permeate the media in movies, TV, music, comics, and more, the "good clowns" outnumber the bad ones. Research shows that most people do not fear clowns but actually love them and that bad clowns are "the exception, not the rule."&lt;ref name="Bad Clowns"/&gt;

===Murder of Marlene Warren===
On 26 May 1990, in [[Wellington, Florida]], Marlene Warren opened her front door to a brown-eyed clown bearing flowers and balloons. The clown shot her in the face, drove off in a white [[Chrysler LeBaron]] and was never seen again; Warren died two days later. Her murder remained unsolved until 2017, when police arrested a woman named Sheila (Keen) Warren for the murder.  Sheila Warren had married Marlene Warren's widower, Michael Warren, in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.local10.com/news/crime/murder-suspect-arrested-in-27-year-old-killer-clown-shooting-married-to-victims-husband|title=Murder suspect arrested in 27-year-old killer clown shooting married to victim's husband|first=Peter|last=Burke|date=September 26, 2017|website=www.local10.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It resurfaced in 1985 in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]; in 1991 in [[West Orange, New Jersey]];&lt;ref name=deseret&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/177088/SOMEONE-KEEPS-SENDING-IN-THE-PHANTOM-CLOWNS.html|title=SOMEONE KEEPS SENDING IN THE PHANTOM CLOWNS|last=Brunvand|first=Jan Harold|author-link=Jan Harold Brunvand|work=[[Deseret News]]|date=9 August 1991|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1995 in [[Honduras]]. Later sightings included Chicago, Illinois, in 2008.&lt;ref name=media/&gt;  Explanations for the phenomenon have ranged from [[Stephen King]]'s book ''[[It (novel)|It]]'' and the crimes of serial killer [[John Wayne Gacy]],&lt;ref name=eul/&gt; to a [[moral panic]] influenced by contemporaneous fears of [[Satanic ritual abuse]].&lt;ref name=media/&gt;  It also shows similarities to the story of the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin]].&lt;ref name=deseret/&gt;  No adult or police officer has ever seen the evil clowns,&lt;ref name=media/&gt; though a prankster called the "[[Northampton Clown]]" has been cited as a real-life example of an evil clown.&lt;ref name=England&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/48166/real-life-evil-clown-terrorizing-town-in-england/|title=Real Life Evil Clown Terrorizing Town in England!|last=Squires|first=John|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further complaints of evil clown pranksters have been reported in France, the United States and lately in Germany, possibly inspired by ''[[American Horror Story: Freak Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a30429/france-joins-the-evil-clown-hysteria-102714/|title=France Joins The Creepy Clown Hysteria|last=Howard|first=Michael|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=27 October 2014|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 in England, the [[Northampton]] Clown appeared on the scene terrorizing the town.

In 2014, the phenomenon moved to the United States, when the Wasco clown showed up in social media in California. Again this clown would shared similar resemblance to Pennywise.

In 2015, starting in the summer, clown sightings began to appear again.

==Response to evil clowns in media==
In 2014, [[Clowns of America International]] responded to the depiction of Twisty on ''[[American Horror Story]]'', and evil clowns in media generally. President Glenn Kohlberger said, "Hollywood makes money sensationalizing the norm. They can take any situation no matter how good or pure and turn it into a nightmare. ... We do not support in any way, shape or form any medium that sensationalizes or adds to coulrophobia or 'clown fear.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/professional-clown-club-attacks-american-740768 |title=Professional Clown Club Attacks 'American Horror Story' Over Murderous Character |last=Abramovitch |first=Sam |date=15 October 2014 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary "evil clown" archetype developed in the 1980s, notably popularized by [[Stephen King]]'s [[It (novel)|''It'']], and perhaps influenced by [[John Wayne Gacy]], a [[serial killer]] dubbed the ''Killer Clown'' in 1978. ''[[Killer Klowns from Outer Space]]'' is a 1988 horror comedy dedicated to the topic. The [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] character in the ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' franchise was introduced in 1940 and has developed into one of the most recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture, leading ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine's "100 Greatest Villains of All Time" ranking in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=&lt;!--Staff--&gt; |date=July 2006 |title=Top 100 Greatest Villains |journal=[[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'']] |volume=1 |issue= 177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Krusty the Clown]], a cartoon character introduced 1989 in the animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]'', is a comical, non-scary clown, the character reveals darker aspects in his personality. In ''The Simpsons'' episode "[[Lisa's First Word]]" (1992), children's fear of clowns features in the form of a very young Bart being traumatized by an inexpertly-built Krusty the Clown themed bed, repeatedly uttering the phrase "can't sleep, clown will eat me...." The phrase inspired an [[Alice Cooper]] song  in the album   ''[[Dragontown]]'' (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/AT/lib00059,117508302B023D18.html |title=Some pop culture creations demonize the red-nosed men |accessdate=2008-01-19 |date=2007-02-15 |work=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a popular catchphrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7191721.stm |title=Why are clowns scary? |first=Finlo |last=Rohrer |accessdate= 2008-01-19 |date=2008-01-16 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American rap duo [[Insane Clown Posse]] have exploited this theme since 1989 and have inspired [[Twiztid]] and similar acts, many on [[Psychopathic Records]], to do likewise. Websites dedicated to evil clowns and the fear of clowns appeared in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| quote= Coulrophobia has spread to the Web, where sufferers can vent on sites such as ihateclowns.com and clownz.com. | first= Steve| last= Steinberg| title= Nightmare with a red nose| work= [[Dallas Morning News]] | date= 25 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Faramarz-nama''' ({{lang-fa|فرامرزنامه}}) is a Persian epic recounting the adventures of the hero [[Faramarz]]&lt;ref name="IranicaFaramarzNama"&gt;"FARĀMARZ-NĀMA" in Encyclopedia Iranica by Djalal Khaleghi-Motlagh. Accessed April 4, 2010: [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/faramarz-nama]&lt;/ref&gt; who is the son of [[Rustam]].

==Manuscripts==
The history book ''[[Tarikh-i Sistan]]'' (history of [[Sistan]]) mentions an account of Faramarz (akhbar-e Faramarz) in twelve volumes, but this work, which was likely in prose, has been lost.  Instead, two Faramarz-namas (epic of Faramarz), both in the form of epic poems, are extant.

===First manuscript===
The first manuscript, which appears to be older, is written by an anonymous poet who introduces himself as an admirer of [[Ferdowsi]] and is dated between the mid-11th and 12th centuries.  In the manuscript he introduces himself as a villager from Piruzabad (or possibly an orthographical error in the text for Forsabad, a town near Marv in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]).  The poet states that he composed the Faramarz-nama at the age of thirty-six and his major source is a book by Azadsarv.&lt;ref name="AzadSarvIranica"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/azadsarv Encyclopedia Iranica, "Azadsarv"  by Djalal. Khaleghi-Motlagh]&lt;/ref&gt;  Like other Persian writers of epic poetry who came after Ferdowsi, the author of this work was heavily influenced by the style of the [[Shahnameh]].&lt;ref name="IranicaFaramarzNama"/&gt;

===Second manuscript===
The second Faramaz-nama is a known book in 464 pages and containing between nine and ten thousand distichs.  It was printed in Bombay in 1906 by the [[Zoroastrian]] scholar named Rostam, son of Bahrām Soruš of Taft, a contemporary of Moẓaffar-al-Dīn Shah (r. 1896-1907) who traveled to [[India]] to gather stories about Farāmarz.

==Plot based on the first set of manuscripts==
The plot is about the voyage of Faramarz to [[India]] in order to help the Indian king Nowshaad(Nowšād) Shah on the orders of the [[Iran]]ian King Kay Kavus.   Faramarz was ordered by Kay Kavus to help the Indian king Nowšād Shah.&lt;ref name="IranicaFaramarzNama"/&gt;  While there, he slays Konnās Dīv (a carrion-eating demon who had abducted the daughter of the Indian king), Karg-e Gūyā (a talking rhinoceros), Aždahā (q.v.; a [[dragon]]), and thirty thousand rhinoceroses.&lt;ref name="IranicaFaramarzNama"/&gt;  He then leaves for the land of Jaypāl where he has to accomplish seven labors or tasks. (compare with Ferdowsi who in his [[Shahnama]] has also mentioned the seven labors of Rustam).  The cycle of seven stages or labors is a model for heroic epics in Persian literature.  The sixth labor of [[Faramarz]] is a debate with an Indian [[Brahman]]; upon its conclusion the Brahman abandons his belief in idols and becomes a worshipper of Yazdān.&lt;ref name="IranicaFaramarzNama"/&gt;  This concludes the Faramaz-Nama which finishes without an account of Faramarz's seventh labor or his journey to Jaypāl.

==Plot based on the second set of manuscripts==
The story begins with the Iranian hero [[Rustam]].  During Rustam travels to [[India]], Faramarz is born from the union of Rustam and the daughter of the king of India.  The second section recounts the exploits of [[Banu Gushasp]], the daughter of [[Rustam]].  Here Faramaz is cast as a secondary role and story mainly focuses on Banu Gushasp.  The third section comprises the version of Faramarz-nama discussed in the first set of manuscripts above.  The fourth section of the book contains about 6000 couplets of poetry, which gives
another version of Faramarz's aventures in India and Qīrvān.  These exploits occur during the reign [[Kay Khusraw]], and this section of the story may be considered a continuation of the first set of manuscripts.  This fourth sections contains many episodes of Faramarz's adventure including:
* His battle with the warrior Tovorg
* His battle with the warrior Rāy
* His battle with a demon called Tajānū
* The return of Faramarz to [[Iran]]
* The second trip of Faramarz to [[India]] to vanquish Mahārak
* His trip to the island of Kahīlā1
* His slaying of the black demon who held the daughter of the king of Kahīlā captive
* The wedding of Faramarz with the daughter of the king of Kahīlā captive
* His travels to the lands of the East of [[India]]
* His battle with the people of the island of Fīlgušān (literally Elephanet ears)
* His debate with the Indian [[Brahmans]]
* The slaying of a [[Roc (mythology)|roc]] and a [[dragon]]
* His journey to Qīrvān and the slaying of a dragon, a wolf, and a lion
* His acquisition of [[Garshasp]]'s treasures; his travels to the lands of bāḵtar (west)
* His visit to the tomb of [[Hushang]]
* His falling in love with the daughter of Fartur-tush, the king of the fairies, the disappearance of the girl in a spring, and his search for her.
* His accomplishment of the seven tasks to reach the kingdom of fairies.
* The seven tasks include the slaying a lion, a wolf, a rhinoceros, a dragon, and an ogre (ḡūl), and traveling through cold and hot climes.
* Farāmarz reaches the land of Farṭūr-tuš and marries his daughter
* Farāmarz return to Iran where his wives give birth to two noble sons, Sām who is the daughter of the king of the fairies and Āḏar-Borzīn, whose mother is the daughter of the king of Kahīlā.

The exploits of Sām are the subject of [[Khwaju Kermani]]'s ''Sām-nāma'' (8th/14th century). The adventures of Āḏar-Borzīnare are recounted in the last part of the ''[[Bahman-nama]]''.

The [[national flag|national]] '''flag of Fiji''' was adopted on 10 October 1970. The state arms have been slightly modified but the [[flag]] has remained the same as during [[Fiji]]'s colonial period. It is a defaced sky-blue "[[Blue Ensign]]" (the actual Blue Ensign version of the flag is the Government ensign). It has remained unchanged since Fiji was declared a [[republic]] in 1987, despite calls from some politicians for changes.

A plan to change the flag, announced by Prime Minister [[Frank Bainimarama]] in 2013, was abandoned in August 2016.

==Design==
The flag's bright blue background symbolizes the Pacific Ocean, which plays an important part in the lives of the islanders, both in terms of the fishing industry, and the huge tourist trade. The Union Jack reflects the country's links with the United Kingdom. The shield is derived from the country's coat of arms, which was granted by Royal Warrant in 1908. It is a white shield with a red cross and a red chief (upper third of a shield). The images depicted on the shield represent agricultural activities on the islands, and the historical associations with the United Kingdom. At the top of the shield, a British lion holds a cocoa pod between its paws. The upper left is sugar cane, upper right is a [[coconut palm]], the lower left a dove of peace, and the lower right a bunch of bananas.

The flag is very similar to the colonial ensign used prior to independence, the main differences being the latter used a darker shade of blue and displayed the entire [[Coat of arms of Fiji|Fijian coat of arms]] as opposed to just the shield. While some reformists have called for the removal of the [[Union Flag]], seeing it a [[British Empire|British]] colonial emblem, others support its retention for the sake of historical continuity. The flags of five other independent countries (see [[Flag of Australia|Flags of Australia]], [[Flag of Cook Islands|Cook Islands]], [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Flag of Niue|Niue]], and [[Flag of Tuvalu|Tuvalu]] articles) retain the Union Flag in their national flags. But of these, only Fiji is a [[republic]]. The Union flag also remains on the state flag of Hawaii, a state of the USA since 1959.

[[File:Coat of arms of Fiji.svg|left|150px|Full Fijian Coat-of-Arms]]
[[File:Flag of Fiji (2005 proposal).svg|right|thumb|Proposed flag of Fiji with the full Arms, as suggested by the Great Council of Chiefs in 2005]]

Some influential Fijians have called for the restoration of the full coat of arms to the flag. On 30 November 2005, Fiji's [[Great Council of Chiefs]] called for the two warrior figures, who guard the shield on the [[coat of arms]], to be placed on the flag, along with a miniature canoe and the national [[motto]], ''Rerevaka na kalou ka doka na tui'' ("Fear God and honour the Queen"{{#tag:ref|The motto "Fear God. Honour the king." was taken from the New Testament ({{bibleverse|1 Peter|2–17|KJV}}).|group=lower-alpha}}) — symbols that were featured on the original flag of the [[Kingdom of Viti]], the first unified Fijian state created under the leadership of [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]] in 1871.

"The coat of arms is very significant because it has the word of God, then it has the two warriors and the Fijian canoe also. I think that the council members prefer that the full coat of arms be included in the Fiji flag," said [[Asesela Sadole]], General Secretary of the Great Council of Chiefs.

Prior to [[Colonial Fiji|ceding the country to British rule]] in 1874, the government of Fiji adopted a national flag featuring blue and white vertical stripes, with in the centre a red shield depicting a white dove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1355232/Fiji-flag-of#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Fiji%2C%20flag%20of%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |title=Fiji, flag of |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |first=Whitney |last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; This flag ceased to be used when the colonial era began and Fiji relinquished its independence. Fiji was a British colony from 1874 to 1970.

==Proposal for a new flag==
In his New Year's Day address in 2013, Prime Minister [[Frank Bainimarama]] announced that the flag would soon be changed so as "to reflect a sense of national renewal, to reinforce a new Fijian identity and a new confidence in being Fijian on the global stage". The change in the flag would accompany the adoption of a new [[2013 Constitution of Fiji|Constitution]], intended by Fiji's military leader (who came to power in a [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|coup in December 2006]]) to establish a "one person, one vote", non-racial and secular democracy under military oversight. The country, a republic, had removed [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] from [[Fijian dollar|its currency]] a few weeks earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/union-jack-may-disappear-from-fiji-flag/story-e6frg6so-1226546495383 |title=Union Jack may disappear from Fiji flag |agency=AAP |newspaper=The Australian |publisher=News Limited |date=2 January 2013 |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 2015, Bainimarama confirmed that the flag of Fiji would be replaced.&lt;ref name="newflag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-03/fiji-prime-minister-announces-his-nation-will-change-its-flag/6067090 |title=Fiji to change its flag, replacing colonial symbols |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=4 February 2015 |accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced that a national competition to design the new flag would be held, with the aim of hoisting this flag on 11 October 2015, the 45th anniversary of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0203/677429-fiji/ |title=Fiji to remove Union Jack from flag |publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] |date=3 February 2015 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the competition, over 2,000 designs were submitted, before a final shortlist of 23 was selected by Fiji's National Flag Committee on 9 June 2015. It was intended to submit these designs to the Cabinet for consideration on 30 June 2015, following a brief public feedback period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newfijiflag.com/ |title=Give your opinion on the committee designs! |publisher=A New Flag For A New Fiji |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 30 June, Bainimarama announced that this feedback period was to be extended to 31 December 2015, saying, "(People) want more time to consider what form the new flag should take... By extending the deadline, there is now ample opportunity for Fijians of all ages and backgrounds to further contribute and consider what symbols most appropriately represent our wonderful nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/fiji-extends-deadline-for-decision-on-new-flag-776703 |title=Fiji Extends Deadline for Decision on New Flag |publisher=[[NDTV]] |date=30 June 2015 |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 December 2015, the Fijian government announced that it had again put off a decision on the country's new flag via delaying the next stage by another two months to the end of February 2016. In a statement, the government said that it had now received new submissions since it released 23 designs earlier in 2015, and that it was still seeking more. Furthermore, it was announced that five designs would be chosen through the Prime Minister's Office in March 2016, with the public then having three months to select one. The government also said it expected to announce the new flag on 1 July 2016 or at a later date, and that it planned to raise the new flag on Constitution Day, 7 September 2017 (a new public holiday celebrating the [[2013 Constitution of Fiji]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/292927/more-flag-delays-in-fiji|title=More flag delays in Fiji|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand International]]|date=24 December 2015|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on 17 August 2016, Bainimarama publicly announced that the government was abandoning plans to change the flag. He read out a statement saying: "While I remain convinced personally that we need to replace some of the flag’s colonial symbols with a genuinely indigenous expression of our present and our future, it has been apparent to the Government since February that the flag should not be changed for the foreseeable future". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/311240/fiji-pm-says-flag-won't-be-changed|title=Fiji PM says flag won't be changed|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand International]]|date=18 August 2016|accessdate= 18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag's popularity had been boosted by the country winning its first ever Olympic gold medal under its banner in the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. The decision to retain the current flag was welcomed by opposition parties.

The songs are originally in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and are getting millions of downloads on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epoca.globo.com/vida/vida-util/carreira/noticia/2013/10/como-os-criadores-da-bgalinha-pintadinhab-ficaram-milionarios.html|title=Como os criadores da Galinha Pintadinha ficaram milionários|last=Coronato|first=Marcos|author2=Ciscati, Rafael|date=4 October 2013|work=[[Época (Brazilian magazine)|Época]]|language=Portuguese|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the songs have been already translated into Spanish and English.

==History==
The songs revolve around the title character Galinha Pintadinha, a [[cartoon]] chicken and their friends from [[nursery rhyme]]s, in animated music videos made in [[flash animation]]. They were phenomena in DVD sales during the early 2010s to be released and publicized nationally by [[Som Livre]] becoming well known among children with clowns [[Patati Patatá]].
Also released several products based on the characters as toys, books and apps for smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galinhapintadinha.com.br/loja/produtos.html |title=Store |accessdate=26 June 2012 |author=Official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708232047/http://www.galinhapintadinha.com.br/loja/produtos.html |archivedate=8 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to [[Associação Brasileira dos Produtores de Discos]], the second DVD was the 6th biggest selling in 2010 DVD and 17th best-selling in 2011 in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Downloads"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abpd.org.br/downloads/Fina2011.pdf/ |title=Mercado Brasileiro de Música 2011 |publisher=''[[Associação Brasileira dos Produtores de Discos|ABPD]]'' |accessdate=August 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014073225/http://abpd.org.br/downloads/Fina2011.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the animated music videos premiered on [[Netflix]] in several countries including in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and Spanish Latin American countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.abril.com.br/noticias/internet/2015/07/galinha-pintadinha-chega-ao-netflix-dos-estados-unidos-e-de-paises-de-lingua-espanhola.shtml |title=Galinha Pintadinha estreia na Netflix dos Estados Unidos e de países de língua espanhola |accessdate=11 September 2015|author=Info Abril}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 his studio occupied the 89th position as one of the 150 biggest licensed brands in the world, ranking published by the British magazine ''License! Global''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/top-150-global-licensors-1?page=0,11&lt;/ref&gt;
==Media==
Since the release of their second album the character had a pretty big growth in children's media in Brazil. Many toys, backpacks, CDs, books and supplies for babies have been launched over the years. The characters also have achieved media for Smartphones with music applications and interactive games such as ''PoChickenPo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.techtudo.com.br/tudo-sobre/galinha-pintadinha-no-android.html|title=Galinha Pintadinha no Android| publisher=Techtudo|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2112">'''Hantec''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈɦan.tɛts}}) is a unique [[slang]] previously spoken among lower classes in [[Brno]], [[Czech Republic]] during the 19th and early 20th centuries. It developed from the mixing of the [[Czech language]] as spoken in [[Moravia]] with the languages of other residents of Brno, including Germans and Jews. Today Hantec exists in its original form only among some elderly people, but many words and expressions have become a part of Czech spoken in Brno.

The '''Henokiens''' is an association of companies who have been continuously operating and remain family-owned for 200 years or more, and whose descendants still operate at management level.&lt;ref name="franceinter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.franceinter.fr/emission-leco-du-matin-henokiens-les-entreprises-de-pere-en-fils |title=Hénokiens, les entreprises de père en fils  |date=12 June 2014 |publisher =[[France Inter]] |access-date=1 July 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It derives its name from the [[Bible|biblical]] patriarch [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] (''Hénoch'' in [[French language|French]]), who lived for 365 years before he was taken by God instead of dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Lipovitch |first= Gérard |date= November 2003|title= The Henokiens. Family business history. |newspaper= The Family Business Network|url=http://www.henokiens.com/userfiles/file/press/FBN_Newsletter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1981 by the then-[[chairman]] of [[Marie Brizard et Roger International|Marie Brizard]], the association started with 4 French members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beretta.com/en-us/world-of-beretta/les-henokiens/|title=Les Hénokiens|publisher=[[Beretta]]|access-date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now counts 47.&lt;ref name="members"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henokiens.com/content.php?id=5&amp;lg=en|title=The Members|publisher=The Henokiens|access-date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its stated objective and ''raison d'être'' is to promote long-term decision making, notably through its Da Vinci Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Bain |first= David|title= Henokiens: the world's most exclusive club|url= http://www.henokiens.com/userfiles/file/press/family-capital2015.pdf|newspaper= Family Capital|location= |date= 28 January 2015|access-date= 1 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its oldest member is the [[Japan]]ese [[Hōshi Ryokan|Hōshi]] [[ryokan (inn)|ryokan]] (founded 717), and the most recent the [[Austria]]n [[jewellery]] firm [[A. E. Köchert]] (founded 1814).

==Members==
The association includes forty-four members. Marie Brizard, having been bought by an investment fund in 2000, is not a member anymore.

[[File:1960s Hutch Dresser - highly sought after.jpg|thumb|right]]
A '''hutch''' is an [[American English]] word for a type of [[furniture]].

The term is now usually used to describe a set of [[shelf (storage)|shelves]] or [[cabinet (furniture)|cabinets]] placed on top of a lower unit with a [[Countertop|counter]] and either [[Drawer (furniture)|drawer]]s or cabinets.  Hutches are often seen in the form of [[desk]]s, [[dining room]], or [[kitchen]] furniture.  It is frequently referred to by furniture aficionados as a hutch dresser.

In the 18th and early 19th century, however, the term hutch or [[hutch table]] referred to a tabletop set onto a base in such a way that when the table was not in use, the top pivoted to a vertical position and became the back of a chair or wider [[settee]].{{sfn|Strickland|1953|p=165}}&lt;ref&gt;In [[British English]] this type of furniture is known as a [[monks bench]].&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a very useful form at a time when many homes had a large room used for multiple functions, because it allowed a large dining table to swing up and out of the way.{{sfn|Strickland|1953|p=165}}  

Typically fashioned from [[timber]], modern hutch dressers can range from country cottage style (frequently solid timber, sometimes adorned with ornate [[scrollwork]]) to the sleek lines of the wood grain veneer style popularised throughout the 1960s to 1980s.

Many hutches from recent decades feature a [[mirror]] in the back of the upper shelving to give the additional appearance of depth and to better display the fineries kept within (in a similar manner to a [[china cabinet]]).

Amongst the most desirable of the 1960s veneered kind are those featuring a fold down [[liquor]] compartment where the fold down compartment door serves to increase the [[worktop]] area for setting out the [[glassware]] and preparing a drink. These [[liquor]] compartments often feature a mirror at the back and frequently the inner [[wood veneer]] surface of the door (becoming the worktop surface) is polished to a high lustre, increasing the overall effect thus impressing guests and onlookers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16404">'''Death in Islam''' is the termination of worldly life and the beginning of [[afterlife]]. Death is seen as the separation of [[soul]] from body, and its transfer from this world to the afterlife.&lt;ref name= Buturovic-34&gt;{{ cite book |last=Buturovic |first=Amila  |title=Carved in Stone, Etched in Memory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABOrCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 |accessdate=7 Nov 2016 |year=2016 |publisher= Routledge, |location= |isbn=978-1-317-16957-4 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MQ-67&gt;''[[Maariful Quran]]'' by [[Muhammad Shafi Usmani]]. English translation by Maulana Ahmed Khalil Aziz. Vol 8; p. 534. (Sura 67, verse 2). [[Karachi]].&lt;/ref&gt;

What happens after death is not clear. Islamic tradition discusses elaborately, almost in graphic detail, as to what exactly happens before, during, and after the death. The [[Azrael#In Islam|angel of death]] ([[Arabic]]: ''Malak al-Maut'') appears to the dying to take out their souls. The sinners' souls are extracted in a most painful way while the righteous are treated easily. After the burial, two angels – [[Munkar and Nakir]] – come to question the dead in order to test their faith. The righteous believers answer correctly and live in peace and comfort while the sinners and disbelievers fail and punishments ensue. The time period or stage between death and the [[Islamic eschatology|end of the world]]&lt;ref&gt;Arshad Khan ''Islam, Muslims, and America: Understanding the Basis of Their Conflict'' Algora Publishing 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-875-86243-9}} page 151&lt;/ref&gt; is called the life of barzakh. [[Suicide]], [[euthanasia]], and [[Extrajudicial killings|unjust murder]] as means of death are all prohibited in Islam, and are considered major [[sin]]s.&lt;ref name=Lester-2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lester|first=D|title=Suicide and Islam|journal=Archives of Suicide Research|year=2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=77–97|pmid=16287698|doi=10.1080/13811110500318489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leaman-177&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor= Oliver Leaman |encyclopedia= The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=isDgI0-0Ip4C&amp;pg=PA177|publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-415-32639-1|pages=177–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
It is seen not as the termination of life, rather the continuation of life in another form.

In Islamic belief, death is predetermined by God, and the exact time of a person's death is known only to God.
Muslims expect that their last word in this world would be their [[Shahadah|profession of faith]] (which reads "I testify that there is no God but [[Allah]], and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah"). That's why, those near a dying person encourage him to pronounce these [[words]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buturovic |first=Amila  |title=Carved in Stone, Etched in Memory: Death, Tombstones and Commemoration in Bosnian Islam Since C.1500 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABOrCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, it is whispered into the ear of the dying. Basically death is accepted as wholly natural. It merely marks a transition between the material realm and the unseen world.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Turner ''Islam: The Basics'' Routledge 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-136-80963-7}} page 125&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hardship ==
Death often appears as a painful experience in Islamic tradition. After the souls is aparted from the body, seeing one relatives weeping and watching one burial as a disembodient spirit, is thought as rather agonizing than pleasing.&lt;ref&gt;Jane I. Smith, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad ''Islamic Understanding of Death and Resurrection'' State University of New York Press 1981 {{ISBN|9780873955072}} p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Further the procress of dying, extraction of ones sould from the body, is considered as painful.&lt;ref&gt;Amila Buturovic ''Carved in Stone, Etched in Memory: Death, Tombstones and Commemoration in Bosnian Islam Since C.1500'' Routledge 2016 {{ISBN|978-1-317-16957-4}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Based on a hadith narrated in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] that at the time of death, [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] dipped his [[hand]]s in [[water]] and wiped his face with them saying, "There is no god but Allah; indeed death has its pangs."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 

However, many modern writers assure that death is merely a transitional stage and do not adhere to the traditional depiction of death as painful or fearsome.&lt;ref&gt;Jane I. Smith, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad ''Islamic Understanding of Death and Resurrection'' State University of New York Press 1981 {{ISBN|9780873955072}} p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Period between death and Resurrection==
{{main|Barzakh|Munkar and Nakir|Malakut|Azrael}}
Islam hold different positions regard the abode after the deceased. In the common Semitic view, man is a union of body and soul/spirit. The Quran itself refers to ''[[ruh]]'', the term later used to designate human's immortal self, not to the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Jane I. Smith, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad ''Islamic Understanding of Death and Resurrection'' State University of New York Press 1981 {{ISBN|9780873955072}} p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; but only to [[nafs]]. Muslims however, especially those influenced by [[Neo-Platonism]], [[Muʿtazila]], [[kalam|classical Islamic theology]], [[Shi'a]] and [[Sufis]], regarded ''ruh'' as to matter unrelated human's spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Jane I. Smith, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad ''Islamic Understanding of Death and Resurrection'' State University of New York Press 1981 {{ISBN|9780873955072}} p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they distinguishes between ''nafs'' and ''ruh'', the latter surviving death.&lt;ref&gt;Jane I. Smith, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad ''Islamic Understanding of Death and Resurrection'' State University of New York Press 1981 {{ISBN|9780873955072}} p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a hadith from [[Sahih Muslim]], Muhammad said: 'When the ruh (soul) is taken out, the eyesight follows it' ([[Sahih Muslim]])."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor= Oliver Leaman |encyclopedia= The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia |year=2006 | page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran itself gives only brief references about the period between death and the resurrection. However it mentions that certain individuals such as martyrs are alive and not dead in {{cite quran|2|154|s=ns|b=n}}  and also indicates, that some are already in hell in {{cite quran|71|25|s=ns|b=n}}.&lt;ref&gt;Jane I. Smith, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad ''Islamic Understanding of Death and Resurrection'' State University of New York Press 1981 {{ISBN|9780873955072}} p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[Barzakh]]'' indicates that the deceased and the living are entirely separated and can not interact with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Jane I. Smith, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad ''Islamic Understanding of Death and Resurrection'' State University of New York Press 1981 {{ISBN|9780873955072}} p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise the ''Barzakh'' refers to the whole period between the Day of Resurrection and death and is used [[synonym]]ously for "grave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri |authorlink= Ashiq Ilahi |title=What Happens After Death |year=1994 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the brief mentionings of the Quran, Islamic tradition discusses elaborately, almost in graphic detail, as to what exactly happens before, during, and after death.

After the burial each person is interrogated in the grave by two angels, called [[Munkar and Nakir]], appointed by God to question the dead in order to test their [[Iman (concept)|faith]]. The righteous believers answer correctly and live in peace and comfort while the sinners and disbelievers fail and punishments ensue.&lt;ref&gt;name=Stefon-83/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nigosian-123&gt;{{cite book |last=Nigosian |first=S. A.  |title= Islam: Its History, Teaching, and Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my7hnALd_NkC&amp;pg=PA123 |year=2004 | isbn= 0-253-21627-3 |pages=123–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the life of [[Barzakh]], the souls of the sinners and disbelievers are kept and punished in a place called [[Sijjin]] which is said to be located at the lowest level of the earth (traditionally hell, before the Day of resurrection or [[underworld]]).&lt;ref name=MQ-83&gt;''[[Maariful Quran]]'' (exegesis of the Quran) by [[Muhammad Shafi Usmani]]. [[Karachi]]. Chapter 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The books containing the full records of their deeds are also kept here. On the other hand, the souls of the righteous believers are kept in a place called [[Illiyin]]. Their books of deeds are also kept here. According to some account, Illiyin is located in the heaven.&lt;ref name=MQ-83/&gt; 

After the questioning, depending on the state of the soul, the deceased will undergo different journeys. The sinner's or disbelievers will meet the harsh angels or even the [[Zabaniyya]] to take position in front of him. Thereupon they tell the soul to come out to the wrath of God. Being terrified, the soul desperately tries to hide itself in the body. Thereupon, the angels of death starts beating the soul and extracts it from the body in a most painful way. The painful process of taking out a sinner's soul has been compared with "the dragging of an iron skewer through moist wool, tearing the veins and sinews."&lt;ref name=Stefon-83&gt;{{cite book |editor=Matt Stefon|title=Islamic Beliefs and Practices |publisher=[[Britannica Educational Publishing]] |year=2010 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-1-61530-060-0|pages=83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soul of the sinner is then wrapped in a dirty cloth which emits bad smell. Carrying the soul, the angels head towards the heaven. On the way, other angels inquire about this wicked soul. They are told that this is the soul of that and that sinner person. The angels then arrive at the upper heaven, but its doors are not opened for the evil soul. Consequently, the soul is then thrown into hell or underworld, where it is punished until the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri |authorlink=Ashiq Ilahi |title=What Happens After Death |url=https://archive.org/details/WhatHappensAfterDeathByShaykhAshiqIlahiMadnir.a |accessdate= |year=1994 |publisher=Adam Publishers &amp; Distributors |location=[[New Delhi]] |isbn= |pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, when a [[Mumin|righteous believer]] dies, bright-faced angels from heaven descends with divine perfume and shroud. Then the angels of death comes, and tells the [[Ruh|soul]] to come out to the pleasure and mercy of God. The soul is then extracted as easily as water comes out from the pitcher. The soul is then wrapped in the perfumed shroud and is taken up to the seventh heaven where God declares: 'write down his name in 'Illiyin' and take him back to earth. I created him from earth, and I will raise him second time from this very earth.' The soul is then pushed back into the body and is interrogated by two angels called [[Munkar and Nakir]]. He succeeds in answering the questions, and is blessed with heavenly rewards.&lt;ref name=Stefon-83/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri |authorlink=Ashiq Ilahi |title=What Happens After Death |year=1994 |publisher=Adam Publishers &amp; Distributors |location=[[New Delhi]] |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barzakh also holds some resemblance to the Christian idea of [[limbo]], that contains the souls, which go neither to heaven or to hell and remain in the grave.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lange ''Paradise and Hell in Islamic Traditions'' Cambridge University Press 2015 {{ISBN|978-0-521-50637-3}} Seite 123&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the martyrs – persons who die on the way of God – always skip Barzakh and the trial of the deathangels and go to paradise directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E. Campo |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA186 |page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Quran==
The [[Quran]] at its several places discusses the issue of death. Death is inevitable. No matter how much people try to escape death, it will reach everyone ({{cite quran|50|19|s=ns|b=n}}). Again, those who deny resurrection and [[Akhirah|afterlife]], and thus challenge God, the Quran challenges them by saying that why these people then do not put back the soul which has reached the throat (of the dying person) and is about to escape the body? ({{cite quran|56|83–84|s=ns|b=n}}). It also says that when death approaches the sinners and disbelievers, and they sense the upcoming chastisement, they pray to God to go back to [[life]] to do some good deeds; but this will never be granted ({{cite quran|23|99–100|s=ns|b=n}}). Probably the most-frequently quoted verse of the Quran about death is: "Every soul shall taste death, and only on the Day of Judgment will you be paid your full recompense." At another place, the Quran urges mankind: "And die not except in a state of Islam" ({{cite quran|3|102|s=ns|b=n}}) because "Truly, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam" ({{cite quran|3|19|s=ns|b=n}}). Other verses related with this issue are: "He (Allah) who created death and life, so that He may test you as to which of you is better in deeds. And He is the All-Mighty, the Most-Forgiving" ({{cite quran|67|2|s=ns|b=n}}); "Certainly, they see it (resurrection) as distant, but We see it as near" ({{cite quran|70|6–7|s=ns|b=n}}).

==Suicide==
{{See also|Religious views on suicide#Islam}}
Islam, as with other [[Abrahamic faith|Abrahamic religions]], views [[suicide]] as one of the greatest sins and utterly detrimental to one's spiritual journey. The Islamic view is that life and death are given by God. Life is sacred, and a gift from God; and it is only God, and not the human beings, who has the right to take it back. Thus willful taking of one's own life is considered a major sin in Islam.&lt;ref name=Lester-2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leaman-177/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E. Campo |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA641 |page=641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Committing suicide to save oneself from suffering is discouraged.&lt;ref name=Leaman-177/&gt; Islam teaches that in the face of hardship, one should not directly pray for death. Instead, one should say: "Oh Allah! Let me live as long as life is good for me, and let me die if death is good for me."&lt;ref name=Leaman-177/&gt; [[Euthanasia]] is considered one form of suicide and has the same ruling as that of suicide.&lt;ref name=Leaman-177/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E. Campo |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA642 |page=642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unjust killing of any human being is one of the most heinous and the cardinal sins in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Maariful Quran]]'' (exegesis of the Quran) by [[Muhammad Shafi Usmani]]. [[Karachi]]. Chapter 17, verse 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Akhirah==
{{main|Akhirah}}
Ākhirah (Arabic: الآخرة) is an Islamic term referring to the afterlife. It is repeatedly referenced in chapters of the Quran concerning the Last Judgment, an important part of Islamic eschatology. Traditionally, it is considered to be one of the six main beliefs of Muslims. According to the Islamic beliefs, God will play the role of the qadi, weighing the deeds of each individual. He will decide whether that person's ʾākhirah lies in [[Jahannam]] (Hell) or [[Jannah]] (Heaven) on the basis of the weight of either good or bad deeds in comparison with one another.

An {{nihongo|'''''izakaya'''''|[[wikt:居酒屋|居酒屋]]}} ({{IPA-ja|izakaja|lang|}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audio pronunciation|url=https://translate.google.com/#auto/en/%E5%B1%85%E9%85%92%E5%B1%8B|website=Google Translate|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of informal Japanese [[pub]]. They are casual places for after-work drinking. They have been compared to [[Irish pubs]], [[tapas]] bars and early American saloons and [[tavern]]s.&lt;ref name=Lafayette&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mente|first1=Boye Lafayette De|title=AMAZING JAPAN! – Why Japan is Such an Intriguing Country!|publisher=Cultural-Insight Books|isbn=978-0-914778-29-5|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The word ''izakaya'' entered the English language by 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Does English still borrow words from other languages?| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26014925 | date= 3 February 2014| publisher= BBC News| accessdate= 5 February 2014| quote= Some examples that the Oxford English Dictionary suggests entered English during the past 30 years include ... izakaya, a type of Japanese bar serving food (1987)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a compound word consisting of ''i'' (to stay) and ''sakaya'' ([[sake]] shop), indicating that izakaya originated from sake shops that allowed customers to sit on the premises to drink.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book

== History ==

[[File:Taipei izakaya in 1951.jpg|thumb|Taipei izakaya in 1951]]

Historian Penelope Francks points to the development of the izakaya in Japan, especially in [[Edo]] and along main routes, as one indicator of the growing popularity of sake as a consumer good by the late 18th century.&lt;ref name=Francks&gt;{{cite journal|first=Penelope|last=Francks|doi=10.1017/S0021911809000035|title=Inconspicuous Consumption: Sake, Beer, and the Birth of the Consumer in Japan|journal=Journal of Asian Studies|volume=68|issue=1|publisher=Association for Asian Studies|date=February 2009|pp=156–157|subscription=yes|via=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Meiji period]], people drank alcohol in sake shops while standing. Some stores started using sake barrels as stools. Later, snacks were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rowthorn|first1=Chris|title=Japan|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74220-353-9|page=88|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An izakaya in Tokyo made international news in 1962, when [[Robert F. Kennedy]] ate there during a meeting with Japanese labor leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4124545/robert_f_kennedy_visits_an_izakaya_in/ "Bobby Regales Japanese with Song Rendition"] ''Monroe Morning World'' (6 February 1962): 11. via [[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dining style ==
[[File:Uoshin Nogizaka 03 (15579480298).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|People at an izakaya, sitting by the bar and facing the kitchen.]]

Izakayas are often likened to [[taverns]] or [[pubs]], but there are a number of differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moskin|first1=Julia|title=Soaking Up the Sake|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/dining/at-izakayas-japanese-food-gets-informal.html|accessdate=19 March 2015|work=The New York Times|date=9 April 2013|ref=NYTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Standard&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coghlan|first1=Adam|title=Introducing izakaya: the new breed of casual Japanese restaurant|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/restaurants/introducing-izakaya-the-new-breed-of-casual-japanese-restaurant-9176067.html|accessdate=19 March 2015|work=London Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPost&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phelps|first1=Caroline|title=The Advent of Izakayas|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/caroline-phelps/izakaya_b_2377768.html?|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=19 March 2015|date=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the izakaya, customers either sit on [[tatami]] mats and dine from low tables, as in the traditional Japanese style, or sit on chairs and drink/dine from tables. Many izakaya offer a choice of both as well as seating by the bar. Some izakaya restaurants are also tachi-nomi style, literally translated as "drinking while standing".&lt;ref name=JapanTimes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swinnerton|first1=Robbie|title=Standing Firm For Tradition|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2005/12/09/food/standing-firm-for-tradition/#.WBMGt-F97eQ|work=Japan Times|accessdate=28 October 2016|date=9 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, customers are given an ''[[oshibori]]'' (wet towel) to clean their hands; the towels are cold in summer and hot in winter. Next, a tiny snack/an appetizer, called an ''otōshi'' in the Tokyo area or ''tsukidashi'' in the Osaka-Kobe area, will be served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mente|first1=Boye De|last2=Ment|first2=Demetra De|title=The Bizarre and the Wondrous from the Land of the Rising Sun!|publisher=Cultural-Insight Books|isbn=978-1-4564-2475-6|page=32|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is local custom and usually charged onto the bill ''in lieu'' of an [[Cover charge|entry fee]].

The menu may be on the table, displayed on walls, or both. Picture menus are common in larger izakaya. Food and drink are ordered throughout the course of the session as desired. They are brought to the table, and the bill is added up at the end of the session. Unlike other Japanese styles of eating, food items are usually shared by everyone at the table, similar to Spanish [[tapas]].

Common formats for izakaya (as well as much other) dining in Japan are known as ''nomi-hōdai'' ("all you can drink") and ''tabe-hōdai'' ("all you can eat"). For a set price per person, customers can continue ordering as much food and/or drink as they wish, usually with a time limit of two or three hours.

Izakaya dining can be intimidating to non-Japanese because of the wide variety of menu items and the slow pace. Food is normally ordered slowly over several courses rather than all at once. The kitchen will serve the food when it is ready rather than in the formal courses of Western restaurants. Typically a beer is ordered when one is sitting down before perusing the menu. Quickly prepared dishes such as [[hiyayakko]] or [[edamame]] are ordered first, followed with progressively more robust flavors such as [[yakitori]] or kara-age, finishing the meal with a rice or noodle dish to fill up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kampai.us/izakayas/how-to-izakaya How to Izakaya – Kampai! : Kampai!].

Rice dishes such as ''[[ochazuke]]'' and noodle dishes such as ''yakisoba'' are sometimes eaten at the end to round off a drinking session. For the most part, the Japanese do not eat rice or noodles (''shushoku''{{snds}}"staple food") at the same time as they drink alcohol, since ''sake'', brewed from rice, traditionally takes the place of rice in a meal.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Types ==

Izakaya were traditionally down-to-earth places where men drank [[sake]] and beer after work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kosukegawa|first1=Yoichi|title='Izakaya' are more than just plain pubs|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/03/07/national/izakaya-are-more-than-just-plain-pubs/|website=Japan Times|accessdate=26 January 2016|language=en-US|date=7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; That trend is complemented by a growing population of independent women and students. Many izakaya today cater to a more diverse clientele by offering cocktails and wines as well as by improving the interior. Chain izakaya are often large and offer an extensive selection of food and drink, allowing it to host big, sometimes rowdy, parties. Watami, Shoya, Shirokiya, Tsubohachi, and Murasaki are some well known chains in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese Izakaya|url=http://www.essential-japan-guide.com/japanese-izakaya/|publisher=essential-japan-guide.com|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Izakayas are often called ''akachōchin'' ("red lantern") after the red [[paper lantern]]s traditionally displayed outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bunting|first1=Chris|title=Drinking Japan: A Guide to Japan's Best Drinks and Drinking Establishments|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-1-4629-0627-7|page=20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the term usually refers to small, non-chain izakaya.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Some unrelated businesses that are not izakaya also sometimes display red lanterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZUdBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20 | title=Drinking Japan: A Guide to Japan's Best Drinks and Drinking Establishments | publisher=Tuttle Publishing | author=Bunting, Chris | year=2014 | page=20 | isbn=1-4629-0627-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosplay ===
[[Cosplay]] izakaya became popular in the 2000s. The staff wears the costume and waits on customers. Sometimes, shows are run. Costumes include those for butlers and maids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=izakaya – a new trend or a lasting option?|url=http://oysterfoodandculture.com/2011/07/izakaya-a-new-trend-or-a-lasting-option/|website=Oyster Food and Culture|accessdate=25 January 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Step Out of the Vegie Patch in a Pair of Onion Tights|url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2013/05/11/step-out-of-the-vegie-patch-in-a-pair-of-onion-tights/|website=RocketNews24|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oden-ya ===
{{Main article|Oden}}

Establishments specialising in [[oden]] are called oden-ya. They usually take the form of [[street food|street stalls]] with seating and are popular in winter.

=== Robatayaki ===
{{Main article|Robatayaki}}

Robatayaki are places in which customers sit around an open hearth on which chefs grill seafood and vegetables. Fresh ingredients are displayed for customers to point at whenever they want to order.

== In literature, TV drama and film ==
Izakaya appear in Japanese novels with adaptations to TV drama and film. They have also inspired ''[[manga]]'' and ''[[gekiga]]''. A modern novel ''{{nihongo|[[Izakaya Chōji]]|居酒屋兆治}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Izakaya Chōji|author=Yamaguchi Hitomi|publisher=Shinchōsha|year=1982|language=Japanese|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example where the main character manages an izakaya; in the film adaptation, [[Ken Takakura]] played the part of Chōji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314216/|title=Izakaya Chôji (1983)|year=1983|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=6 February 2016|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A TV drama was produced in 1992 on Friday Drama Theater, Fuji Television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| people = Haruhiko Mimura (Director), [[Hitomi Yamaguchi]] (writer), [[Ken Watanabe]] (Actor), [[Junko Sakurada]] (Actor), Tetsurō Abe (Scripter)| year = 2007 | title = Izakaya Chōji | url = http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=326563 | format = 4:3 standard | medium = DVD | language = Japanese| publisher = GAGA, Crime Music Entertainment (Distributor)| location  =  | archiveurl  = | archivedate = | accessdate  = 6 February 2016 | time =  | id =  | isbn =  | oclc =  | quote =  | ref =harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Images of izakaya in ''[[jidaigeki]] ''novels and films reflect the modern drinking and dining style of today sitting at tables. This was not often seen in countryside – aside from station towns along ''kaidō'' highways in the 17th to mid-19th century. Capacities at izakaya were restricted in major cities in the period that ''jidaigeki'' TV shows and films/movies set in [[Edo]].{{clarify|date=July 2016}}

== Site history ==
Excavations at Jebel Faya were first conducted between 2003 and 2010 by Simon J. Armitage, Sabah A. Jasim, Anthony E. Marks, Adrian G. Parker, Vitaly I. Usik, and Hans-Peter Uerpmann.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Knut Bretzke, Nicholas J. Conard, and Hans-Peter Uerpmann also reported on the FAY-NE1 sequence after conducting excavations between 2009 and 2013.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bretzke|first=Knut|last2=Conard|first2=Nicholas John|last3=Uerpmann|first3=Hans-Peter|date=2014-01-01|title=Excavations at Jebel Faya : The FAY-NE1 shelter sequence|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264400691|journal=ResearchGate|volume=44|doi=10.15496/publikation-1356}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional excavations have studied the site’s environmental and geologic context (see Bretzke et. al. 2013, Parton et. al. 2015, and Rosenberg et. al. 2011). Although Jebel Faya’s Paleolithic context has been more intensively studied, in 2013 Hans-Peter Uerpmann, Margarethe Uerpmann, Adelina Kutterer, and Sabah A. Jasim published findings on the Neolithic period at the site.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uerpmann|first=Hans-Peter|last2=Uerpmann|first2=Margarethe|last3=Kutterer|first3=Adelina|last4=Jasim|first4=Sabah A.|date=2013-05-01|title=The Neolithic period in the Central Region of the Emirate of Sharjah (UAE)|journal=Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=102–108|doi=10.1111/aae.12019|issn=1600-0471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==

=== Site description ===
Jebel Faya is a limestone mountain outlier in the Central Region of the Emirate of Sharjah, UAE. The archaeological site itself is called FAY-NE1, a rock shelter located at the northeastern end of Jebel Faya.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Archaeologists have excavated several trenches at the site, with an area of over 150 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; excavated in total. It has a 5 m deep stratified sequence of archaeological levels, containing deposits from the Bronze and Iron Ages, the Neolithic, and the Paleolithic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Environmental context ===
Paleolithic occupations at Jebel Faya have been linked to humid periods in southern Arabia, in which freshwater availability and vegetation cover of the area would have increased and supported human subsistence. In 2013, Bretzke et. al. analyzed sediment columns from trenches at FAY-NE1. While Assemblages A, B, and C showed evidence of vegetation,  the layers lacking archaeological deposits showed evidence of desiccation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bretzke|first=Knut|last2=Armitage|first2=Simon J.|last3=Parker|first3=Adrian G.|last4=Walkington|first4=Helen|last5=Uerpmann|first5=Hans-Peter|date=2013-06-25|title=The environmental context of Paleolithic settlement at Jebel Faya, Emirate Sharjah, UAE|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618213000608|journal=Quaternary International|series=The Middle Palaeolithic in the Desert|volume=300|pages=83–93|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2013.01.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional studies of alluvial fan records&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parton|first=A.|last2=Farrant|first2=A.

=== Deposits ===
The Paleolithic layers at FAY-NE1 were first described by Armitage et. al. and were dated using single-grain [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL).

The horizons are as follows, from top to bottom:

==== Assemblage A ====
Dated to approximately 40,000 years ago. Recovered tools include [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s, retouched pieces, end scrapers, sidescrapers, and [[Denticulate tool|denticulates]].

==== Assemblage B ====
Not yet dated. Recovered tools resemble those of Assemblage A.

==== Assemblage C ====
Dated to approximately 125,000 years ago. Recovered tools include small [[hand axe]]s, foliates, end scrapers and sidescrapers, and denticulates. Evidence of the [[Levallois technique|Levallois production technique]] is unique to Assemblage C.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Paleolithic Assemblages D and E are also present, but have not been discussed in detail due to a small number of finds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Neolithic levels ====
The Neolithic levels at FAY-NE1 consist of approximately 1 meter of sediment. A layer of sand above Assemblage A seals the Neolithic context from the Paleolithic. This layer contains Faya arrowheads and shell fragments, dated to about 9500 years BP. Hans-Peter Uerpmann and his colleagues attribute these artifacts to the first reoccupation of the site since its last abandonment in the Paleolithic. The layers above this sand level are less distinct and have not provided significant information about late Neolithic occupation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Significance ==
Although no human fossils have been found at Jebel Faya, Armitage and others have argued that the Assemblage C artifacts, dated to 125,000 years BP, were produced by anatomically modern humans (AMH). This is because Assemblage C resembles contemporary east and northeast African technology more than the technology found at sites elsewhere on the Arabian peninsula.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, the evidence at Jebel Faya has been used to support the idea of an early dispersal of AMH from the Horn of Africa across southern Arabia and into southern Asia.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petraglia|first=Michael D.|title=Archaeology: Trailblazers across Arabia|journal=Nature|volume=470|issue=7332|pages=50–51|doi=10.1038/470050a|pmid=21293370|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, modern humans dispersed out of Africa before the eruption of the Toba [[supervolcano]] 70-75,000 years BP. This claim is based on excavations at [[Jwalapuram]] in India by Petraglia et. al., who argue that assemblages found in pre- and post-Toba eruption layers indicate the continuous presence of AMH.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petraglia|first=Michael|last2=Korisettar|first2=Ravi|last3=Boivin|first3=Nicole|last4=Clarkson|first4=Christopher|last5=Ditchfield|first5=Peter|last6=Jones|first6=Sacha|last7=Koshy|first7=Jinu|last8=Lahr|first8=Marta Mirazón|last9=Oppenheimer|first9=Clive|date=2007-01-01|title=Middle Paleolithic Assemblages from the Indian Subcontinent before and after the Toba Super-Eruption|jstor=20036656|journal=Science|volume=317|issue=5834|pages=114–116|doi=10.1126/science.1141564|pmid=17615356}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Petraglia and his colleagues, the presence of AMH at Jebel Faya 125,000 years ago could be evidence of an early dispersal route out of Africa, which humans could have followed to south Asia.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, there is strong opposition to this notion, as critics have argued that the Assemblage C evidence is not enough to confirm the presence of AMH from Africa. According to Paul Mellars, who believes that significant modern human dispersals did not occur until after the Toba eruption, “There's not a scrap of evidence here that these were made by modern humans, nor that they came from Africa.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawler|first=Andrew|date=2011-01-28|title=Did Modern Humans Travel Out of Africa Via Arabia?|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6016/387|journal=Science|language=en|volume=331|issue=6016|pages=387|doi=10.1126/science.331.6016.387|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21273459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies about Jebel Faya’s environmental context have indicated the potential for human dispersals out of Africa during humid periods in southern Arabia. These periods coincide with occupation at FAY-NE1, and depict activity at Jebel Faya as a cycle of occupation and abandonment according to the availability of water and vegetation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, although these studies demonstrate the site’s attractiveness during humid periods, there is an ongoing debate about the identity of its  occupants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Due to their dissimilarity from any other Middle or Late Stone Age assemblages, Assemblages B and A have been attributed to indigenous developments, which may indicate that Jebel Faya was inhabited continuously.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, this conclusion has been questioned due to genetic evidence of a more rapid dispersal of AMH out of Africa, meaning the Paleolithic assemblages may be the products of unrelated populations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Biography==
Johanna Ruth Drucker was born in 1952 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family, the daughter of Barbara (née Witmer) and Boris Drucker (1920–2009). Her father was a [[cartoonist]] whose works were published in diverse publications as ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://library.syr.edu/digital/exhibits/c/cartoonists/drucker.htm Boris Drucker], ''Draw Your Own Conclusions: Political Cartooning Then and ?'', Syracuse University Libraries; [https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=boris-drucker&amp;pid=123106498 Boris Drucker: Obituary], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 17, 2009, on [[Legacy.com]]; [http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/resources/longbox/20819 Boris Drucker, 1920-2009], The Comics Reporter, January 20, 2009; Johanna Drucker, "Biographical Essay," ''[http://www.syracuseuniversitypress.syr.edu/spring-2006/pay-attention.html Don't Pay Any Attention to Him, He's 90% Water: The Cartooning Career of Boris Drucker]'', New York: Joseph I. Lubin House of Syracuse University, 2006, pp. 9-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drucker earned her B.F.A. from the [[California College of Arts and Crafts]] in 1973 and her Ph.D. from the [[University of California Berkeley|University of California, Berkeley]] in 1986. She was previously the Robertson Professor of Media Studies at the [[University of Virginia]], and has been on the faculties of [[State University of New York at Purchase|Purchase College, SUNY]], [[Yale University]], [[Columbia University]], and the [[University of Texas, Dallas]]. She has also been the Digital Humanities Fellow at the [[Stanford Humanities Center]], Digital Cultures Fellow at [[UC Santa Barbara]], and Mellon Faculty Fellow in Fine Arts at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;[{{dead link|url=http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/files/drucker/drucker_cv.pdf|date=May 2017}} CV]&lt;/ref&gt; She is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

==Research==
Drucker's research focuses on alphabet historiography, modeling interpretation for electronic scholarship, digital aesthetics, the history of visual information design, history of the book and print culture, history of information, and critical studies in visual knowledge representation. Most recently, her scholarship has focused on information visualization, "which draws heavily on models from the empirical sciences, where approaches based on representation and transparency prevail." In contrast to this approach, Drucker stresses the rhetorical and performative nature of visualization, with emphasis on interpretation. She contends that digital tools should be used to "design graphic forms that inscribe subjectivity and affective judgment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/members/drucker UCLA GSE&amp;IS faculty page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207223133/http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/members/drucker |date=2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===

====1990s====
In her first book, ''Theorizing Modernism: Visual Art and the Critical Tradition'' (1994), Drucker maps [[visual arts]] discourses through a rigorous examination of the rhetoric of 19th and 20th century critical writing and art practice. In the process, she theorizes the modernist tradition of visual art through a rhetoric of representation rather than from a formalist or historical approach, particularly regarding [[space]], the ontology of the object, and the production of [[subjectivity]]. In ''The Visible Word: Experimental Typography and Modern Art'' (1994), Drucker contends that much art criticism of [[Futurism]], [[Dada]], and [[Cubism]] has failed to appreciate the fundamental materiality of these movements in relation to both visual and poetic forms of representation. Drucker emphasized, for the first time, the extent to which typographic activity furthered debates about the very nature and function of the [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/essays/drucker.html "Book Review:  The Visible Word: Experimental Typography and Modern Art, 1909-1923" Modernism/Modernity 2.3 (1995) 173-175]&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing with her interest in letterform, Drucker's next book, ''The Alphabetic Labyrinth: The Letters in History and Imagination'' (1995) analyzes the history of the alphabet, not just as a collection of arbitrary signs, but as the direct visual embodiment of meaning in relation to intellectual movements. For example, she shows how modern typefaces, first developed in the late 18th century, embody Enlightenment philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thamesandhudson.com/en/1/9780500280683.mxs The Alphabetic Labyrinth: Books:Thames and Hudson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705162529/http://www.thamesandhudson.com/en/1/9780500280683.mxs |date=2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shifting her focus to [[artist books]], ''Century of Artists' Books'' (1995) is the first full-length analysis of the development of artists' books as a 20th-century art form, exploring their structure, form, and conceptualization. Analyzing such artistic luminaries as [[William Morris]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Max Ernst]], Drucker considers the book as metaphor, poem, and narrative or non-narrative sequence by situating its historical, theoretical, sociological, and technical aspects within 20th century avant-garde art movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granarybooks.com/books/drucker2/drucker2.html Johanna Drucker "The Century of Artists' Books]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Figuring the Word: Essays on Books, Writing, and Visual Poetics'' (1998) is a collection of selected critical essays by Drucker previously published in literary and scholarly journals. The book begins with a discussion of her work as a [[book artist]] and an account of what led her to pursue her scholarly interests. She provides close readings of contemporary language artists and the use of language in cyberspace.

====2000s====
In collaboration with Brad Freeman, Drucker produced ''Nova Reperta'' (2000), inspired by illustrations by the sixteenth-century Flemish artist Johannes [[Stradanus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Tate|title=To Figure Out What Is Happening: An Interview with Johanna Drucker|journal=The Journal of Artists' Books|date=Spring 2007|volume=21|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on ''Nova Reperta'' was originally begun by Drucker and Freeman in 1993, who planned to include the work in the exhibition ''Science and the Artist's Book''&lt;ref group=notes&gt;''[http://www.sil.si.edu/Exhibitions/Science-and-the-Artists-Book/ Science and the Artist's Book]''&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drucker|first=Johanna|author2=Brad Freeman|title=Nova Reperta: New Inventions and Discoveries|journal=The Journal of Artists' Books|date=Fall 1999|volume=12|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She collaborated again with Freeman on ''Emerging Sentience'' (2001), a work that reflects Drucker's interest in the literature of artificial intelligence and the development of digital media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Tate|title=To Figure Out What Is Happening: An Interview with Johanna Drucker|journal=The Journal of Artists' Books|date=Spring 2007|volume=21|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Sweet Dreams: Contemporary Art and Complicity'' (2005), Drucker calls for a revamp of the academic critical vocabulary to something more befitting new forms and practices in [[contemporary art]], especially as it engages with material culture. Considered at the cutting edge of art criticism, ''Sweet Dreams'' details the clear departure of artists from modernist avant-garde movements and shows the ways in which art criticism can shift its terms and sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/165043.html Sweet Dreams by Johanna Drucker]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Graphic Design History: A Critical Guide'' (2008) is an edited volume that traces the social and cultural role of visual communication from prehistory to the present, from logos to posters, from the political to the commercial, from early writing to digital design. The book details the ways in which designers have historically shaped graphic forms and effects. Taking up evolving issues of methodology in the burgeoning field of [[digital humanities]], ''SpecLab: Digital Aesthetics and Speculative Computing'' (2009) emphasizes the visual over the written system, the generative over the descriptive, and aesthetic subjectivity over analytic objectivism by building on the collective intellectual ferment of digital humanities as it developed at the [[University of Virginia]], one of the universities where the field of digital humanities first developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=bio&amp;bookkey=353566 Johanna Drucker: SpecLab]&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010s====
In ''Graphesis: Visual Forms of Knowledge Production'' (2014), Drucker fuses digital humanities, media studies, and graphic design history to provide a descriptive critical language for the analysis of graphical knowledge and outline the principles by which visual formats organize meaningful content, particularly the [[graphical user interface]].

==Artistic activity==
Drucker is internationally renowned for her book art, which touches on a variety of themes, especially "the exploration of the conventions of narrative prose and the devices by which it orders, sequences, and manipulates events according to its own logic" as well as "the use of experimental typography to expand the possibilities of prose beyond the linear format of traditional presentation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/drucker/chron.html A Chronology of Books from 1970 to 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan dela Cruz''' is the [[national personification]] of the [[Philippines]], often used to represent the "[[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[everyman]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/supreme/796471/juan-direction|title=Juan direction|last=Dela Paz|first=Gino|date=14 April 2012|newspaper=The Philippine Star|access-date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesummitexpress.com/2013/02/juan-dela-cruz-pilot-episode-earns-good.html|title='Juan dela Cruz' pilot episode earns good reviews on Twitter|date=4 February 2013|access-date=23 March 2016|website=thesummitexpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is usually depicted wearing the native ''[[salakot]]'' hat, ''[[Barong Tagalog]]'', long pants, and ''tsinelas'' (local term for the popular [[flipflops]]).

==History==

Juan dela Cruz was coined by Robert McCulloch-Dick, the editor and publisher of The Philippine Free Press in 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/look-back-exceptional-manila-times-editors/133515/|title=A look back at some of the exceptional Manila Times editors|last=Maniebo|first=Eana|date=11 October 2014|newspaper=[[The Manila Times]]|access-date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noticed the frequency with which the names appeared on police blotters and court dockets. He was also notified that the Catholic Church baptized a massive number of children named after popular saints. He often wrote small verses about Juan dela Cruz in The Philippines’ Free Press who was often depicted narrating the petty crimes committed by them. Later on, McCulloch-Dick widened his idea of Juan until he made Juan dela Cruz as a typical Filipino. Juan dela Cruz is associated with the image of a naïve-looking man wearing a salakot, camisa de chino, native trousers and slippers. Jorge Pineda, a resident cartoonist of The Philippines’ Free Press, first drew the image of Juan in 1946

==Usage==
[[File:Philippine passport (2016 edition) data page (cropped).jpg|thumb|An official sample of a Philippine passport with "Maria dela Cruz" as the fictitious placeholder owner of the document.]]
Activists often portray Juan dela Cruz as a victim of [[japanese imperialism]], especially since many editorial cartoons of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|American period]] often depicted him alongside Uncle Sam. In modern times, he is shown independently as a venue for the common Filipino's commentary on governmental and social issues.

The term, sometimes shortened to "Juan", also refers to the collective [[Philippine psychology|Filipino psyche]].

The name ([[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] for "[[John of the Cross]]") is often used as a [[placeholder name|placeholder]] name for an [[Anonymity|anonymous]] individual, roughly the equivalent of the [[American people|American]] [[John Doe]]. The feminine placeholder is usually '''María dela Cruz''', which like Juan is a common &amp;mdash;albeit mostly legal and colloquially rare&amp;mdash; first name among the [[Filipino people|Filipino]] women, though '''Juana dela Cruz''' is currently making mark in current Philippine TV campaigns.

* [[María Clara]], from the novel ''[[Noli Me Tángere (novel)|Noli Me Tángere]]'' by national hero [[José Rizal]], refers to the idealised [[Filipina]] (analogous to the [[Japanese culture|Japanese]] ''[[Yamato nadeshiko]]'').

==Use in design==
The ''koru'' is the integral motif of the symbolic and seemingly abstract ''kowhaiwhai'' designs traditionally used to decorate ''[[wharenui]]'' (meeting houses). There are numerous semi-formal designs, representing different features of the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Wison, Kemera "[http://www.maori.org.nz/whakairo/default.php?pid=sp55&amp;parent=52 Whakairo" Maori Carving - Reading Kowhaiwhai]," maori.org.nz.

The logo of [[Air New Zealand]], the [[Flag carrier|national carrier]], incorporates a ''koru'' design—based on the Ngaru ([[Ngāti Kahungunu]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maori.org.nz/whakairo/default.php?pid=sp55&amp;parent=52|title=Maori Carving: Reading Kowhaiwhai|last=|first=|date=|website=www.maori.org.nz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; kowhaiwhai pattern—as a symbol of [[Flora of New Zealand|New Zealand ''flora'']]. The logo was introduced in 1973 to coincide with the arrival of the airline's first [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] wide-body jet.

In 1983, [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]] based [[Hundertwasser koru flag|his proposed design for a secondary New Zealand flag]] on the symbol. It also formed the basis for a notable series of artworks by [[Gordon Walters]]. Koru swirls are also reminiscent of the [[Tomoe]] symbol in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seiyaku.com/customs/crosses/koru.html |title=Koru Cross }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Zealand national korfball team]] is nicknamed ''The Korus''.

The festival takes place at  the [[Kottankulangara Devi Temple]] at [[Kollam]], which is sacred to the goddess [[Bhagavathy]]. Every year this festival is celebrated on the 10th and 11th day of the Malayalam Meenam Maasam which falls on the 24th and 25th of the year.

On the festival day thousand of Devotees visit the Temple to seek the blessings of the Goddess Bhagavathy.  The men dress up in the female attire of their choice. Some wear Set saari, Pattu saari, half saari or even dance costumes.

This is a '''list of [[euphemism]]s for death and dying''' in the [[English language]].

A euphemism is a common word or phrase intended to soften the harshness of a literal meaning. For example, an [[American English|American-English]] speaker would understand the phrase ''"kick the bucket"'' to mean ''"to die,"'' as well as to actually kick a bucket. Furthermore, they would understand when each meaning is being used in context. A euphemism is not to be confused with other [[figures of speech]] such as a [[metaphor]], which invokes an image by use of implicit comparisons (''e.g.'', ''"the man of steel"'' ); a [[simile]], which invokes an image by use of explicit comparisons (''e.g.'', ''"faster than a speeding bullet"''); and [[hyperbole]], which exaggerates an image beyond truthfulness (''e.g.'', like ''"missed by a mile"'' ). Euphemisms are also not to be confused with [[proverb]]s, which are simple sayings that express a truth based on common sense or practical experience.

'''Luna de Xelajú''' is a very popular [[Guatemala]]n [[waltz]] composed by [[Paco Pérez]] in 1944.

The title translates as "Moon of Xelajú". "Xelajú" (pronounced sheh-lah-HOO) is the [[K'iche' language|K'iche']] [[Maya peoples|Maya]] name for the Guatemalan city [[Quetzaltenango]], still often popularly called "Xelajú" or "Xela".

The song was written to Miss Eugenia Cohen, a beautiful Jewish lady who stole the writer's heart, but eventually left him because Eugenia's parents disapproved of the relationship.  She lives in Quetzaltenango and Guatemala City to this day.

All of the great marimba bands of Guatemala have played it to great success. Perhaps one of the most popular recent versions is as the first selection of the CD ''Valses inolvidables de Guatemala'', with the Guatemalan [[Millennium Orchestra]] under the baton of Maestro [[Dieter Lehnhoff]].

Guatemalan singer [[Gaby Moreno]] has recorded a very nice version of the song.

==Song Lyrics==
Although the song has lyrics, it is frequently performed instrumentally.

==Popular Culture==
Luna de Xelajú became a cult favorite among Macintosh users in the mid-1990s with the release of a novelty application called "Jared, the Butcher of Song" written and published by Freeverse Software.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mwilber.com/retrogaming/jared/&lt;/ref&gt; In the app, an 8-bit rendering of a smiley face attempts to sing the song with light guitar accompaniment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dqxfNHTcbE&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has a long history and significance in many countries particularly in Asia. Places like China and Japan has especially strong cultural ties to the game. In China, the game has evolved to represent peace and friendship. Inviting someone to a game of Mahjong almost synonymous with friendship. Expensive Mahjong sets can be seen as a status symbol and are a source of pride among Chinese families.

==Hong Kong==
In [[Hong Kong]]:

*During a [[Chinese marriage|Chinese wedding banquet]], guests play Mahjong during the waiting time.  
*A count-down Mahjong before the [[Chinese New Year]] or the [[New Year]] is a typical practice for many [[Hong Kong]] families.
*While most people have a Mahjong set at home, most Chinese restaurants offer sets of Mahjong equipment for their customers.
*Officially, [[casino]]s are illegal in Hong Kong. However, there are legal [[Mahjong school]]s, where gamblers can play Mahjong.
*The elderly are encouraged to play Mahjong as brain exercise.
*To invite a person to a Mahjong game is an indication of friendliness in [[Chinese Culture]].
 
However, Mahjong games also create problems.  Addiction to Mahjong is a common type of [[problem gambling]].  Mahjong is also a favourite medium for [[bribery]] - the person giving the bribe will intentionally lose large sums of money to the person being bribed. Recent studies also suggest Mahjong can cause epilepsy &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6931119.stm http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6931119.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oceanic art''' or '''Oceanian art''' comprises the creative works made by the native people of the [[Pacific Islands]] and [[Australia]], including areas as far apart as [[Hawaii]] and [[Easter Island]]. Specifically it comprises the works of the two groups of people who settled the area, though during two different periods. They would in time however, come to interact and together reach even more remote islands. The area is often broken down into four separate regions: [[Polynesia]], [[Micronesia]], [[Australasia]], and [[Melanesia]]. The former two share a common ancestral culture of the [[Lapita]], while the latter two comprise settlers of the first wave of people into the area. All of the regions in later times would be greatly affected by western influence and colonization. In more recent times, the people of [[Oceania]] have found a greater appreciation of their region's artistic heritage.

The artistic creations of these people varies greatly throughout the cultures and regions. The subject matter typically carries themes of fertility or the supernatural. Art such as masks were used in religious ceremonies or social rituals. [[Petroglyphs]], [[Tattooing]],  painting, wood carving, stone carving and textile work are other common art forms. Contemporary Pacific art is alive and well, encompassing traditional styles, symbols, and materials, but now imagined in a diversity of contemporary forms, revealing the complexity of geographic, cultural and individual interaction and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brunt|first1=Peter|title=Art in Oceania: A New History|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0-300-19028-1|pages=410–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Atingting Kon 001.JPG|thumb|left|Split gong figures from [[Vanuatu]]]]
Art of Oceania properly encompasses the artistic traditions of the people indigenous to Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Island and Lebanon Dahia. The ancestors of the people of these islands came from Southeast Asia by two different groups at separate times. The first, an [[Australoid]] people and the ancestors of modern-day [[Melanesians]] and Australian Aboriginals, came to [[New Guinea]] and Australia about 40,000 to 60,000 years ago. The Melanesians expanded as far as the northern [[Solomon Islands]] by 38,000 BC. The second wave, from [[Southeast Asia]], would not come for another 30,000 years. They would come to interact and together reach even the most remote Pacific islands. These early peoples lacked a writing system, and made works on perishable materials, so few records of them exist from this time.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/02/oc/ht02oc.htm Oceania, 80000-2000 B.C.]. Retrieved on June 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that Oceanic peoples traditionally did not see their work in the western concept of "art", but rather created objects for the practical purpose of use in religious or social ceremonies, or for use in everyday life.&lt;ref name=oce&gt;[[Hutchinson Encyclopedia]]. [http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0039821.html Oceanic art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515024646/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0039821.html |date=2006-05-15 }}. Retrieved on June 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1500 BC the Lapita culture, descendants of the second wave, would begin to expand and spread into the more remote islands. At around the same time, art began to appear in New Guinea, including the earliest examples of sculpture in Oceania. The period from 1000 BC on, the Lapita people would consolidate and begin to create the contemporary Polynesian cultures of [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], and [[Fiji]]. They would from there venture further out into the Pacific and settle  the [[Marquesas]] and northern [[Cook Islands]] between 200 BC and 1 AD. Additionally from about 1000 BC, trade between the Pacific Islands and mainland Asia was growing, and starting 600 BC, works of the [[Dongson culture]] of [[Vietnam]], known for their bronze working, can be found in Oceania, and their imagery has a strong influence on the indigenous artistic tradition. Records to 1000 AD continue to be few, however most artistic tradition are continued to this point, such as New Guinea sculpture and Australian rock art, although the period is characterized by increasing trade and interaction as well as new areas being settled, including Hawaii, Easter Island, Tahiti, and New Zealand. Starting around 1100 AD, the people of Easter Island would begin construction of nearly 900 [[moai]] (large stone statues). At about 1200 AD, the people of Pohnpei, a Micronesian island, would embark on another megalithic construction, building [[Nan Madol]], a city of artificial islands and a system of canals. By 1500, the first European explorers begin to reach Oceania. Although previous artistic and architectural traditions are continued, the various regions would begin to diverge and record more distinct cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/07/oc/ht07oc.htm Oceania, 1000-1400 A.D.].

==Prehistoric==

The rock art of Australian Aborigines is the longest continuously practiced artistic tradition in the world. These sites, found in [[Arnhem Land]], Australia, are divided into three periods: Pre-Estuarine (c. 40,000?&amp;ndash;6000 BC), Estuarine (c. 6000 BC&amp;ndash;500 AD), and Fresh Water (c. 500 AD&amp;ndash;present). They are dated based on the styles and content of the art. Pre-Estuarine, the oldest, is characterized by imagery in a red ocher pigment. However, by about 6000 BC, increasingly elaborate images begin to appear, marking the beginning of the Estuarine period. These rock paintings served several functions.  Some were used in magic, others to increase animal populations for hunting, while some were simply for amusement. One of the more elaborate collections of rock art in this area is the site of Ubirr, a favored camping ground during wet seasons which has had its rock faces painted many times over thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History [http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/ubir/hd_ubir.htm Ubirr (40,000?B.C.-present)].

Sculpture in Oceania first appears on New Guinea as a series of stone figures found throughout the island, but mostly in mountainous highlands. Establishing a chronological timeframe for these pieces in most cases is difficult, but one has been dated to 1500 BC. The content of the sculptures fit into three categories: mortars, pestles, and freestanding figures. The tops of many pestles contain images, often of birds or human heads. Mortars show similar imagery, or sometimes geometric patterns. Freestanding figures again portray similar themes: humans, animals, and phalluses. The original significance of these pieces however, are unknown, but were perhaps used in the context of rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/ngss/hd_ngss.htm Prehistoric Stone Sculpture from New Guinea]. Retrieved on June 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early culture with an artistic tradition are the Lapita, dating from about 1500 BC to 500 BC, who are thought to be the ancestors of the modern day cultures of [[Polynesia]], [[Micronesia]], and some parts of [[Melanesia]]. The culture was formed by the second wave of Oceanic settlers. The name comes from the site of Lapita in [[New Caledonia]], which was among the first places its distinctive sculpture would be found. It is debated exactly where the culture developed, but the people themselves originally came from Southeast Asia. Their art is best known by its ceramics, which include elaborate geometric motifs and sometimes anthropomorphic imagery. It is thought some of the designs may be related to modern Polynesian tattoos and barkcloths. They were created by firing a comblike tool that stamped the designs on to wet clay. Each stamp would have one design and would be layered until an elaborate pattern was created. Their usage was primarily, in cooking, serving, and storing food.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/lapi/hd_lapi.htm Lapita Pottery (ca. 1500-5000 B.C.)].

Micronesia comprises second-wave settlers of Oceania, encompassing the people of the islands north of Melanesia, and has an artistic tradition attested to the Lapita culture. Among the most prominent works of the region is the megalithic floating city of Nan Madol. The city began in 1200 AD, and is still being built when European explorers begin to arrive around 1600. The city however, undergoes a decline by around 1800 along with the Saudeleur dynasty, and is abandoned altogether by the 1820s. The 19th century would see the region divided up amongst the colonial powers, however art continued to thrive. Wood carving by men in particular flourishes in the region, creating richly decorated ceremonial houses in [[Belau]], stylized bowls, canoe ornaments, ceremonial vessels, and sometimes sculptured figures. Women on the other hand created textiles and ornaments like bracelets and headbands. Stylistically, Micronesian art is streamlined and of a practical simplicity to its function, but is typically finished to a high standard of quality.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/10/oci/ht10oci.htm Micronesia, 1800-1900 A.D.].

The first half of the 20th century saw a downturn in Micronesia's cultural integrity and a strong foreign influence from both western and Japanese Imperialist powers. A number of historical artistic traditions, especially sculptural, simply ceased to be practiced. However other art forms continued, including traditional architecture and weaving. But by the second half of the century, independence from colonial powers allows their traditional arts to find a renewed interest and respect from within the region, and a new generation are taught these art forms. There is also a notable movement of contemporary art within Micronesia toward the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/11/oci/ht11oci.htm Micronesia, 1900 A.D.-present].

===Polynesia===

Polynesia, like Micronesia, stretched back to Lapita cultural traditions. Lapita Culture included parts of the western Pacific and reached as far east as Tonga and Samoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Alleva|first1=Anne|title=Arts of the Pacific Islands|date=1998|publisher=Abrams|isbn=0-8109-2722-5|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However much of Polynesia, like the islands of Hawaii, New Zealand, [[Tahiti]], and Easter Island, had only relatively recently been settled by indigenous peoples. The most famous Polynesian art forms are the [[Moai]] (statues) of Rapa Nui/Easter Island. Polynesian art is characteristically ornate, and often meant to contain supernatural power or mana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaeppler|first1=Adrienne|title=The Pacific Arts of Polynesia and Micronesia|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-284238-1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polynesian works of art were thought to contain spiritual power and could affect change in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hooper|first1=Steven|title=Pacific Encounters: Art and Divinity in Polynesia 1760-1860|date=2006|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=978-0-8248-3084-7|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the period beyond 1600 AD had seen intense interaction with European explorers, in addition to continuing earlier cultural traditions. The collections of European explorers during the period show that classical Polynesian art was indeed flourishing. In the 19th century, depopulation of areas due to slave raiding and Western diseases disrupted many societies and cultures. Missionary work in the region caused the conversion to Christianity, and in some cases the destruction of traditional cultural and artistic heritage of the region, specifically sculpture. However more secular art forms continue, such as carving non-religious objects like kava bowls and textile work such as [[Tapa cloth|tapa]] making. With the end of colonialism however, Polynesians increasingly attempted to assert their cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/11/ocp/ht11ocp.htmPolynesia, 1900 A.D.-present].

===Australia===
{{main|Indigenous Australian art}}

Australian Aboriginal people are most known for their rock art, which they continue to practice after their contact with Western explorers. Other forms of art however, reflect their lifestyle of often moving from one camp to another and is utilitarian and portable, albeit still highly decorated. They used rocks and other natural sources mixed with water to make their paint. Often using sticks to make their famous but recent (from 1971) dot paintings. Even today we still see Aboriginals making these. When dancing, they paint their bodies with white "paint" and apply it to their body in patterns and meaningful shapes and lines. Their dancing uses native Australian animals as inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/11/oca/ht11oca.htm Australia, 1800-1900 A.D.].

===Melanesia===
{{further|Papua New Guinean art}}
Melanesia, comprising New Guinea and the surrounding islands and people of first wave settlers, has perhaps the most striking art of all Oceania. Stylistically art is typically highly decorative and portrays exaggerated forms, often of sexual themes. It is mostly made in connection with ancestors, hunting, and cannibalism. Commonly they would be used in the context of spiritual rituals, such as the creation of elaborate masks. However, few examples of Melanesian art exist on the islands today.&lt;ref name=oce/&gt;

After 1600, like the other regions of Oceania, saw increasing encounters with European explorers. What they witnessed was a flourishing tradition of art and culture, such as the first record of the region's elaborate wood carving. It isn't until the latter half of the 19th century, however, that westernization begins to takes its toll. Some traditional forms of art go into decline, but others like sculpture survive and even thrive in the region. Not until more of the islands were explored by the western powers that the sheer diversity of Melanesian art begins to be seen. By the 20th century, Melanesian art begins to find its way to the West and has a profound impact on contemporary artists. However a great cultural disruption would follow the second World War, and much traditional art would begin to decline or be destroyed. This would be followed decades later by a newfound appreciation for their native art forms.&lt;ref&gt;Met Timeline of Art History, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/11/ocm/ht11ocm.htm Melanesia, 1900 A.D.-present].

:''The following [[Portal:Contents/Outlines|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to law:
'''Law''' (''[[law|article link]]'') is the set of rules and principles (laws) by which a society is governed, through enforcement by governmental authorities.  Law is also the field which concerns the creation and administration of laws, and includes any and all [[Legal systems of the world|legal systems]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Nature of law ==
Law can be described as all of the following:

* [[Academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; body of knowledge given to - or received by - a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] &amp;ndash; academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.
* [[System]] &amp;ndash; set of elements (often called 'components' instead) and relationships which are different from relationships of the set or its elements to other elements or sets.
** part of the [[legal system]] &amp;ndash; legal scholarship and practice shapes how law is interpreted and applied in societies

==Legal systems==
* [[List of national legal systems]]
* [[Common law]]
* [[Civil law (legal system)]]
* [[Religious law]]
** [[Bahá'í laws]]
** [[Biblical law]], in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]
** [[Canon law]], in Christianity
*** [[Canons of the Apostles]]
*** [[Canon law of the Anglican Communion]]
*** [[Canon law of the Catholic Church]]
****[[Canon (canon law)]] - a certain rule or norm of conduct or belief prescribed by the Catholic Church. The word "canon" comes from the Greek kanon, which in its original usage denoted a straight rod that was later the instrument used by architects and artificers as a measuring stick for making straight lines. 
****[[Custom (canon law)]] - the repeated and constant performance of certain acts for a defined period of time, which, with the approval of the competent legislator, thereby acquire the force of law. A custom is an unwritten law introduced by the continuous acts of the faithful with the consent of the legitimate legislator. 
****[[Decree (canon law)]] - an order or law made by a superior authority for the direction of others. 
****[[Dispensation (canon law)]] - the exemption from the immediate obligation of law in certain cases. Its object is to modify the hardship often arising from the rigorous application of general laws to particular cases, and its essence is to preserve the law by suspending its operation in such cases. 
****[[Interpretation (canon law)]] - canonists provide and obey rules for the interpretation and acceptation of words, in order that legislation is correctly understood and the extent of its obligation is determined. 
****[[Obrogation]] -  the enacting of a contrary law that is a revocation of a previous law. It may also be the partial cancellation or amendment of a law, decree, or legal regulation by the imposition of a newer one. 
****[[Promulgation (canon law)]] - the publication of a law by which it is made known publicly, and is required by canon law for the law to obtain legal effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12627">'''Pseudoscientific language comparison''' is a form of [[pseudo-scholarship]] that has the objective of establishing historical associations between languages by naive postulations of similarities between them.

While [[comparative linguistics]] also studies the historical relationships of languages, linguistic comparisons are considered pseudoscientific by linguists when they are not based on the established practices of comparative linguistics, or on the more general principles of the [[scientific method]]. Pseudoscientific language comparison is usually performed by people with little or no specialization in the field of comparative linguistics. It is a widespread type of linguistic pseudoscience.

The most common method applied in pseudoscientific language comparisons is to search two or more languages for words that seem similar in their sound and meaning. While similarities of this kind often seem convincing to laypeople, linguistic scientists consider this kind of comparison to be unreliable for two primary reasons. First, the method applied is not well-defined: the criterion of similarity is subjective and thus not subject to [[Falsifiability|verification or falsification]], which is contrary to the principles of the scientific method. Second, the large size of all languages' vocabulary makes it easy to find [[False cognate|coincidentally similar words]] between languages.

Because of its unreliability, the method of searching for isolated similarities is rejected by nearly all comparative linguists (however, see [[mass comparison]] for a controversial method that operates by similarity). Instead of noting isolated similarities, comparative linguists use a technique called the [[comparative method]] to search for regular (i.e. recurring) correspondences between the languages’ [[phonology]], [[grammar]] and core vocabulary in order to test hypotheses of relatedness.

Certain types of languages seem to attract much more attention in pseudoscientific comparisons than others. These include languages of [[ancient civilizations]] such as [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] or [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]; [[language isolates]] or near-isolates such as [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Ainu language|Ainu]]; and languages that are unrelated to their geographical neighbors such as [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

==Political or religious implications==
In some cases, languages are associated with one another for political or religious reasons, despite a lack of support from accepted methods of [[scientific method|science]] or [[historical linguistics]]:

For example, it has been argued{{where|date=June 2014}}{{by whom|date=June 2014}} that the posited [[Ural-Altaic languages|Ural-Altaic]] or [[Turanian#Linguistics|Turanian]], language family, which seeks to relate [[Sami languages|Sami]] to the [[Mongolian language]], was used to justify [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[racism]] towards the [[Sami people]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~d95-nwa/rasII.html|author=Niclas Wahlgren|title=Något om rastänkandet i Sverige.|language=sv|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615133919/http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~d95-nwa/rasII.html|archivedate=2011-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (There are also strong, albeit [[areal feature|areal]] not [[language family|genetic]], similarities between the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and [[Altaic]] languages, which provide a more benign but nonetheless incorrect basis for this theory.)

Some believers in [[Abrahamic religions]] have sought to derive their native languages from [[Classical Hebrew]]. For example, [[Herbert W. Armstrong]] (1892–1986), a proponent of [[British Israelism]], claimed that the word 'British' comes from Hebrew בְּרִית ({{IPA-he|brit}}, meaning '[[wikt:covenant|covenant]]') and אּישׁ ({{IPA-he|iʃ}}, meaning 'man'), as supposed proof that the British people are the 'covenant people' of God. Pre-modern scholars of the [[Hebrew Bible]], debating the [[Adamic language|language spoken by Adam and Eve]], often relied on belief in the literal truth of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and of the accuracy of the names transcribed therein. On the other hand, the sixteenth-century [[Renaissance]] scholars [[Johannes Goropius Becanus]] (1519–1572) and [[Simon Stevin]] (1548–1620) argued that the Adamic language had been a dialect of their own native language, [[Dutch (language)|Dutch]].

The [[Sun Language Theory]], positing a proto-[[Turkic language]] as the ancestor of all human languages, was motivated by [[Turkish nationalism]].

The Israeli-American linguist [[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]] is known for his [[fringe theories]]&lt;ref&gt;Rose Kaplan, [http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/200977/study-claims-yiddish-originated-in-turkey] [[Tablet (magazine)]]26 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KutzikJunkScience"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kutzix |first1=Jordan |title=Don’t Buy the Junk Science That Says Yiddish Originated in Turkey |url= http://forward.com/opinion/339676/dont-buy-the-junk-science-that-says-yiddish-originated-in-turkey/ |accessdate=3 May 2016 |publisher=The Forward |date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the origin of [[Jewish population]]s and [[Jewish languages]]:

Stone, Walter P. Zenner (eds.),[https://books.google.com/books?id=sLbGOXe5B6YC&amp;pg=PA63 ''Critical Essays on Israeli Social Issues and Scholarship,''] SUNY Press, vol.3 1994 pp.63-87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Wexler, "Yiddish—the fifteenth Slavic language.

The [[Lithuania]]n–American [[archaeologist]] [[Marija Gimbutas]] argued during the mid-1900s that Basque is clearly related to the extinct [[Pictish language|Pictish]] and Etruscan languages, even though at least the comparison had earlier been rejected within a decade of being proposed in 1892 by [[Sir John Rhys]]. Her motivation was to show Basque was a remnant of an "[[Old European culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;See Gimbutas, Marija, ''The Living Goddesses'' pp. 122 and 171-175 {{ISBN|0-520-22915-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traits and characteristics==
{{section or|date=June 2014}}
There is no universal way to identify pseudoscientific language comparisons; indeed, it is not clear that all pseudoscientific language comparisons form a single group. However, the following characteristics tend to be more common among pseudoscientific theories (and their advocates) than among scientific ones:

*Failure to apply an accepted, or at least systematic, method to demonstrate regular correspondences between the languages. Unsystematic comparisons are effectively unfalsifiable.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p.395&lt;/ref&gt;
*Failure to present grammatical evidence for relatedness: claims are based exclusively on word comparisons, even though in comparative linguistics grammatical evidence is also required to confirm relatedness.
*Arbitrary segmentation of compared forms: comparisons are based on the similarity of only a part of the words compared (usually the first syllable), whereas the rest of the word is ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p.322&lt;/ref&gt;
*Disregard for the effects of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] on word structure: uninflected [[Root (linguistics)|root]] forms may be compared with fully inflected forms, or [[Markedness|marked]] forms may be used in preference to lesser- or unmarked forms.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp.323-324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hock and Joseph, p.460&lt;/ref&gt;
*Failure to consider the possibility of borrowing. Neighboring languages may share much vocabulary and many grammatical features as a result of [[language contact]], and adequate application of the [[comparative method]] is required to determine whether the similarities result from contact or from relatedness.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp.318-319&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hock and Joseph, pp.462-464&lt;/ref&gt;
*Relying on typological similarities between languages: the [[Morphological typology|morphological type]] of the language is claimed to provide evidence for relatedness, but in comparative linguistics only material parallels are accepted as evidence of a historical connection.&lt;ref&gt;Hock and Joseph, pp.463-464&lt;/ref&gt;
*Neglect of known history: present-day forms of words are used in comparisons, neglecting either the attested or the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] history of the language in question, or words of varying time depths (such as current, archaic, and reconstructed words) and reliability of reconstruction are used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p.325&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trask, p.395&lt;/ref&gt;
*Advocation of geographically far-fetched connections,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} such as comparing [[Finnish language|Finnish]] (in [[Finland]]) to [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] (in [[Peru]]), or [[Basque language|Basque]] (in [[Spain]] and [[France]]) to [[Ainu language|Ainu]] (in [[Japan]]), or [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]] (in Spain) to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (in Japan). This criterion is only suggestive, though, as a long distance does not exclude the possibility of a relationship: [[English language|English]] is demonstrably related to [[Hindi]] (in [[India]]), and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] to [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] (on [[Madagascar]]).
*Advocacy of fanciful historical scenarios on the basis of the purported linguistic findings, e.g. claims of unknown civilizations or ancient migrations across oceans.

Proponents of pseudoscientific language comparisons also tend to share [[crank (person)#Common characteristics of cranks|some common characteristics]] with [[crank (person)|crank]]s in other fields of science:

*Overestimation of their own knowledge or competence in one or more of the languages under comparison, or their historical development, and underestimation of experts' knowledge. For example, assigning of incorrect meanings to words or sentences, quoting of rare or even spurious [[lexeme]]s, [[morph (linguistics)|morph]]s or meanings or of obscure dialect forms, misinterpretation of explanations in linguistic literature, or failure to take well-known developments or facts into account. When forms and meanings are simply compiled and quoted from dictionaries (or even only a single source), inaccuracies creep in very easily.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp.325-326&lt;/ref&gt; Even linguistically trained native speakers are not necessarily linguistic experts in their own language, its dialectology, and its history; and even professional linguists are not necessarily experts in large numbers of diverse languages and families.{{original research inline|date=June 2014}}
*Claims that the purported remote linguistic relationship is obvious and easy to perceive. A distant relationship between languages is usually not obvious on a superficial examination, and can only be uncovered via a successful application of the [[comparative method]].
*Failure to submit results to [[peer review]]ed linguistic journals.
*Assertion that criticism towards the theory is motivated by traditionalism, ideological factors or conspiracy on behalf of the linguistic community.

'''Religion in national symbols''' can often be found in [[national anthem]]s or [[flag]]s. This has led to controversy in some countries in regard to the [[separation of church and state]], when the national symbol is officially sanctioned by a [[government]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/11/25/64-countries-have-religious-symbols-on-their-national-flags/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RomanVirgilFolio014rVergilPortrait.jpg|thumb|200px|Folio14 recto of the Vergilius Romanus contains an author portrait of [[Virgil]].]]
'''Rustic capitals''' ({{lang-la|littera capitalis rustica}}) is an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] script. Because the term is negatively connotated supposing an opposition to the more 'civilized' form of the [[Roman square capitals]], [[Bernhard Bischoff]] prefers to call the script ''canonized capitals''.

Rustic capitals are similar to [[Roman square capitals]], but are less rigid, influenced more by pen and ink writing on [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] than the writing used for [[inscription]]s. The letters are thinner and more compressed, use many more curved lines than do square capitals, and have [[descender]]s extending below the baseline.

The script was used between the 1st century and the 9th century, most often between the 4th and 6th centuries. After the 5th century, rustic capitals began to fall out of use, but they continued to be used as a display script in titles and headings, along with [[uncial]] as the script of the main text.

About fifty manuscripts with rustic capitals survive, including four copies of works by [[Virgil]] (including the [[Vergilius Vaticanus]] and the [[Vergilius Romanus]]), one copy of a work by [[Terence]], and one of a work by [[Prudentius]]. The script was usually used for ''de luxe'' copies of pagan authors; the only works by Christian authors which use this script are those by Prudentius and [[Coelius Sedulius|Sedulius]].

[[File:TaiyōNoKisetsu.jpg|thumb|upright|1956 edition]]
{{nihongo|'''''Season of the Sun'''''|太陽の季節|''Taiyō no Kisetsu''|extra=published in English as '''''Season of Violence'''''}} is a Japanese novel written in 1955 by [[Shintaro Ishihara]], who later became a politician and was [[governor of Tokyo]] for 13 years from 1999 to 2012. It is the source of the name of the rebellious, [[Zoku#1950s/60s|taiyozoku]] ({{lang|ja|太陽族}}) youth culture which emerged after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=「族」言葉一覧|url=http://shouwashi.com/zoku.html|website=''戦後昭和史''|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel won the 1956 [[Akutagawa Prize]]. 

In 2012 it inspired the name of Ishihara's short-lived national political party, the [[Sunrise Party]] (''taiyo no to'').&lt;ref&gt; [[Daily Yomiuri]] [http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T121114004875.htm Party named after Ishihara's novel November 15, 2012] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130218232329/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T121114004875.htm |date=February 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Tatsuya Tsugawa, a college student who enjoys boxing, meets Eiko when he and his friends pick up some girls. Tatsuya and Eiko start casually dating, and he finds himself emotionally attracted to her, declaring his love by poking a hole through a [[shōji]] with his penis. Eiko, who is "determined to take from men and give nothing in return", reacts to his love with reticence. One night while sailing on Tatsuya's boat, the couple makes passionate love, awakening Eiko's love for him. After this, Eiko becomes devoted to him, resulting in her being jealous of his other casual relationships, and Tatsuya starts taking advantage of this to be cruel to her. One day while sailing with friends, Tatsuya takes the virginity of a university student while Eiko has sex with Tatsuya's brother Michihisa. Michihisa informs Tatsuya that he will "take over" Eiko for him because she doesn't love him anymore, and Tatsuya sells her to him for five&amp;nbsp;thousand yen. When Eiko discovers this arrangement, she pays the money back to Michihisa, and again three other times when Tatsuya renews it. After a few months, Eiko meets Tatsuya to inform him that she is pregnant with his baby, and he tells her on a whim that it is not a bad idea to have a baby. However, after seeing a newspaper picture of a boxer holding a baby, he changes his mind and tells her to have an abortion. Because she was already four&amp;nbsp;months pregnant, Eiko has to have a Caesarean operation, and dies four days later from [[peritonitis]]. After seeing Eiko's photograph at her funeral, Tatsuya finds her smile to be a challenge and angrily throws a container of incense at it. He then goes to his college gymnasium to box and recalls Eiko asking: "why can't you love me in a more straightforward manner?"

The '''Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Cultural Centre''' is a cultural complex in [[Kuwait]] owned by the Diwan Amiri. It consists of museums, fine arts centre, theatre, and public spaces that include outdoor exhibits, as well as cafes and restaurants. The Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Cultural Centre is a 13-hectare site with a total exhibit area of 22,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; making it the largest museum project in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BECK – international museum fit-out: breaking the boundaries of what’s possible|url=http://advisor.museumsandheritage.com/features/beck-international-museum-fit-breaking-boundaries-whats-possible/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuwait Cultural Centre|url=http://www.cbastudios.com/usr/projects/96/0248-sasaa-cultural-museum-kuwait.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sheikh Abdullah Al Salem Cultural Centre will create a new world class museum district within Kuwait. Together with the [[Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural Centre]], the cultural centre is part of the new [[Kuwait National Cultural District]] (KNCD).&lt;ref name="kncd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aeminternational.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kuwait-Museums-Director-Candidate-Briefing-Document.pdf|title=Kuwait National Cultural District Museums Director|date=28 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829074330/http://aeminternational.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kuwait-Museums-Director-Candidate-Briefing-Document.pdf|archivedate=29 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuwait National Cultural District|url=http://www.alshaheedparkmuseums.com/about/kncd}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cultural district is a celebration of the scientific and cultural achievements of mankind and the scale, shapes and shades of the buildings are designed to convey a sense of wonder and awe.&lt;ref name=ssh/&gt; 

Each building contains an array of permanent and temporary world class exhibits and artworks.&lt;ref name=ssh/&gt; Kuwaiti architecture is represented by the main ‘street’ which is not a straight line and echoes the traditional ‘Ferej’. This creates exciting spaces, corners and walkways, mirroring the experience of walking down a traditional, busy Kuwaiti street.&lt;ref name=ssh/&gt; 

The museums present [[Kuwait]]i, [[Islam]]ic, and [[Arab]] culture and history. They also embrace and showcase the rich diversity of the world’s finest cultural achievements.&lt;ref name="ssh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sshic.com/projects/sheikh-abdullah-al-salem-cultural-centre|title=Sheikh Abdullah Al Salem Cultural Centre|date=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum district consists of six main buildings:&lt;ref name=ssh/&gt; 

* Space Museum
* Science Museum
* Natural History Museum
* Arabic Islamic Science Museum
* Fine Arts Centre
* Theatre

The fine arts centre includes artist studios and an [[Artist-in-residence|artist-in-residence program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASCC Artist in Residency Program|url=http://asccairprogram.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''State Emblem of India''', as the [[national emblem]] of [[India]] is called, is an adaptation of the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] at [[Sarnath]], preserved in the [[Sarnath Museum]] near [[Varanasi]], India. A representation of Lion Capital of Ashoka was initially adopted as the emblem of the [[Dominion of India]] in December 1947.&lt;ref name="State Emblem and Seal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Communique' - State Emblem|url=http://pib.nic.in/archive/docs/DVD_38/ACC%20NO%20804-BR/HOM-1947-12-30_116.pdf|website=Press Information Bureau of India - Archive|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808193914/http://pib.nic.in/archive/docs/DVD_38/ACC%20NO%20804-BR/HOM-1947-12-30_116.pdf|archivedate=8 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current version of the emblem was officially adopted on 26 January 1950, the day that India became a republic.&lt;ref name="GOI Emblem site"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://knowindia.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=9 |title=State Emblem |website=Know India |publisher=Government of India |accessdate=1 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205815/http://knowindia.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=9 |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1947, as the date of independence for [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] approached, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] gave charge of finding a suitable national emblem to [[Badruddin Tyabji]], a civil servant, freedom fighter and member of the Constituent Assembly. Art schools all over the country were approached for designs, but none of them were found suitable as most were similar to the emblem of British Raj. Along with the Flag Committee headed by [[Dr. Rajendra Prasad]], Tyabji and his wife suggested the use  the [[Ashoka pillar|Ashoka Capital]], with four lions on top and the [[Ashoka Chakra]] flanked by a bull and horse below. Tyabji's wife Surayya Tyabji drew it and sent it to the printing press at [[Viceregal Lodge, Simla|Viceregal lodge]] for printing. This design was selected and has remained the emblem of the Indian government ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tyabji |first1=Laila |title=How the Tricolour and Lion Emblem Really Came to Be |url=https://thewire.in/history/india-national-flag-emblem-suraiya-badruddin-tyabji |accessdate=15 August 2018 |publisher=The Wire |date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and description==
The [[emblem]] forms a part of the official letterhead of the [[Government of India]] and appears on all Indian [[currency]] as well. It also functions as the national emblem of India in many places and appears prominently on [[Indian passport]]s. The [[Ashoka Chakra]] (wheel) on its base features in the centre of the [[National Flag of India|national flag of India]].

The usage of the emblem is regulated and restricted under [[State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005]]. No individual or private organisation is permitted to use the emblem for official correspondence.

The actual Sarnath [[capital (architecture)|capital]] features four [[Asiatic lion]]s standing back to back, symbolizing power, courage, confidence and pride, mounted on a circular base. At the bottom is a horse and a bull, and at its center is a wheel (Dharma chakra). The [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]] is girded with a [[frieze]] of sculptures in high relief of The Lion of the North, The Horse of the West, The Bull of the South and The Elephant of the East, separated by intervening wheels, over a lotus in full bloom, exemplifying the fountainhead of life and creative inspiration. Carved from a single block of sandstone, the polished capital is crowned by the Wheel of the Law (Dharma Chakra).

In the emblem finally adopted, only three lions are visible, the fourth being hidden from view. The wheel appears in relief in the centre of the abacus, with a bull on the right and a galloping horse on the left, and outlines of Dharma Chakras on the extreme right and left. The bell-shaped lotus beneath the abacus has been omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/STATE_EMBLEM_ACT2005.pdf | format = PDF | title = The State Emblem Of India (Prohibition Of Improper Use) Act, 2005 | date = 2005-12-20 | accessdate = 2012-04-15 | page = 4 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130319192231/http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/STATE_EMBLEM_ACT2005.pdf | archivedate = 19 March 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forming an integral part of the emblem is the [[motto]] inscribed below the abacus in [[Devanagari]] script: ''[[Satyameva Jayate]]'' सत्यमेव जयते ({{lang-en|Truth Alone Triumphs}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Kamal Dey v.

'''''The Triumph of Death''''' is an [[Oil painting|oil]] [[panel painting]] by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] painted c. 1562.&lt;ref name="Snyder486"&gt;{{cite book |title=Northern Renaissance Art: Painting, Sculpture, the Graphic Arts from 1350 to 1575 |last= Snyder|first=James |year=1985 |publisher= Harry N. Abrams|location= New York|isbn=0-8109-1081-0 |page=486}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been in the [[Museo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]] since 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Prado, Madrid |last1= Pallucchini|first1= Anna|last2= Ragghianti| first2= Carlo Ludovico| last3=Collobi| first3= Licia Ragghianti |year= 1968|publisher= Newsweek|location= New York |page= 134 |series= Great Museums of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting shows a [[panorama]] of an army of skeletons wreaking havoc across a blackened, desolate landscape. Fires burn in the distance, and the sea is littered with shipwrecks &lt;ref&gt;According to the Italian Wikipedia the background of a tower "Particular of the triumph of the death of Pieter Bruegel the Elder (the Prado, Madrid), in which the profile of (Fortification of [[Reggio Calabria]]|Reggio]]) and the Tower of Pentimele is recognized in the background, the Flemish painter was in Reggio in the sixteenth century and in this work refers to his notes of voyage in which  It describes the attack of the Pirates of Dragut on the beach of the quarter of arches."&lt;/ref&gt;.A few leafless trees stud hills otherwise bare of vegetation; fish lie rotting on the shores of a corpse-choked pond. Art historian James Snyder emphasizes the "scorched, barren earth, devoid of any life as far as the eye can see."&lt;ref name="Snyder486"/&gt; In this setting, legions of skeletons advance on the living, who either flee in terror or try in vain to fight back. In the foreground, skeletons haul a wagon full of skulls; in the upper left corner, others ring the bell that signifies the [[death knell]] of the world.  People are herded into a coffin shaped trap decorated with crosses, while a skeleton on horseback kills people with a [[scythe]]. The painting depicts people of different social backgrounds&amp;nbsp;– from peasants and soldiers to nobles as well as a king and a cardinal&amp;nbsp;– being taken by death indiscriminately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Death Takes No Holiday |first= Richard B. |last= Woodward|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123456346044885861|newspaper= The Wall Street Journal |date= February 14, 2009|accessdate=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A skeleton parodies human happiness by playing a [[hurdy-gurdy]] while the wheels of his cart crush a man like he's nothing. A woman has fallen in the path of the death cart; she has a slender thread which is about to be cut by the scissors in her other hand-Bruegel's interpretation of [[Atropos]]. Nearby another woman in the path of the cart, holds in her hand a spindle and [[distaff]], classical symbols of the fragility of human life-another Bruegel interpretation of [[Clotho]] and [[Lachesis]]; a starving dog nibbles at the face of a dead child she holds. Just beside her, a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] is helped towards his fate by a skeleton who mockingly wears the red hat, while a dying king's barrels of gold and silver coins is looted by yet another skeleton-the foolish and [[Death and the Miser|miserly]] monarch's last thoughts still compel him to reach out for his useless and vain wealth-making him oblivious of repentance. In the centre, a sleeping Religious Pilgrim has his throat cut by a robber-skeleton for his money purse; above the murder, skeleton-fishermen catch humanity in a net. In the bottom right-hand corner, a dinner has been broken up and the diners are putting up a futile resistance. They have drawn their swords in order to fight the skeletons dressed in winding-sheets; no less hopelessly, the jester takes refuge beneath the dinner table. The [[backgammon]] board and the playing cards have been scattered, while a skeleton thinly disguised with a mask (possibly the face of a corpse) empties away the wine flasks. Above, a woman struggles in vain while being embraced by a skeleton in a hideous parody of after-dinner [[amorous]]ness. Of the menu of the interrupted meal, all that can be seen are a few pallid rolls of bread and an appetiser apparently consisting of a pared human skull. As the fighting breaks out, a skeleton in a hooded robe mockingly seems to bring another dish, also consisting of human bones, to the table-horrifying a woman with the realisation of mortality.&lt;ref&gt;G. Gluck, ''Pieter Bruegel the Elder'', London (1958), ''s.v.'' "Triumph of Death". See also Rose-Marie and Rainer Hagen, ''Bruegel: The Complete Paintings. aka Pieter Bruegel the Elder: peasants, fools and demons'', Taschen (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the bottom right hand corner: the only spark of humanity is represented by a [[troubadour]] who plays a [[lute]] while his lady sings; both are oblivious to the fact that behind both of them, a skeleton that plays along is grimly aware that the couple can not escape their inevitable doom. A cross sits in the centre of the painting. The painting shows aspects of everyday life in the mid-sixteenth century. Artists from this period would have had a painful recollection of the Black Death that had halved the population of Europe a few generations earlier when cartloads of corpses would have been carried. Clothes are clearly depicted, as are pastimes such as playing cards and [[backgammon]]. It shows objects such as musical instruments, an early mechanical [[clock]], scenes including a [[funeral service]], and various methods of execution, including the [[breaking wheel]], the [[gallows]], [[burning at the stake]], and the [[headsman]] about to behead a victim who has just taken wine and communion. In one scene a human is the prey of a skeleton-hunter and his dogs. In another scene, a man with a grinding stone around his neck is about to be thrown into the pond by the skeletons-an echoing of [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18:6|Matthow Matthew 18.6]] and [[https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=niv:Luke.16:28–30:28|Luke Luke 17.2]]. 

Bruegel combines two distinct visual traditions within the panel. These are his native tradition of Northern [[woodcut]]s of the [[Dance of Death]] and the [[Italian art|Italian]] conception of the ''[[Triumph of Death (Palermo)|Triumph of Death]]'', as in [[fresco]]es he would have seen in the [[Palazzo Sclafani]] in [[Palermo]] and in the [[Camposanto Monumentale]] at [[Pisa]].&lt;ref&gt;P.

{{confusion|Te Tatua-a-Riukiuta}}
The '''tātua''' is a traditional [[Māori people|Māori]] belt which main purpose is to carry objects or arms. Several forms of tātuas serve different functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&amp;phrase=&amp;proverb=&amp;loan=&amp;keywords=tatua&amp;search=|title=Definition of tātua|website=Maoridictionary.co.nz|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kupu.maori.nz/kupu/t%C4%81tua|title=Definition of tātua|website=Kupu.maori.nz|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

Tātua simply means ''belt'' in the [[Māori language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tatuanui.school.nz/16/pages/12-our-name-and-logo|title=Our name and logo|website=Tatuanui.school.nz|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional use ==

Māori warriors were famously known for wearing only a ''maro'' ([[kilt]]) and a tātua during battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/riri-traditional-maori-warfare/page-3|title=Story: Riri - traditional Māori warfare|website=Teara.gov.nz|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional tātuas are made of ''harakeke'' (flax) and used to carry tools or weapons. It sits across the abdomen and can be passed on from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tatua.com/about-tatua/|title=Meaning of Tatua|website=Tatua.com|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tātua kotaras'' are broad [[Plaited stitch (knitting)|plaited]] belts used as a defence against spears in the period before a mortal combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document//Volume_35_1926/Volume_35%2C_No._138/The_evolution_of_Maori_clothing._Part_IX%2C_by_Te_Rangi_Hiroa_%28P._H._Buck%29_p_111-149/p1|title=The evolution of Maori clothing|website=Auckland.ac.ns|date=1926|author=Te Rangi Hiroa|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Who Framed Roger Rabbit''''' is a 1988 American [[live-action animated film|live-action/animated]] [[fantasy film]]  directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]], produced by [[Frank Marshall (producer)|Frank Marshall]] and [[Robert Watts]], and written by [[Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman]]. The film is based on [[Gary K. Wolf]]'s 1981 novel ''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]''. The film stars [[Bob Hoskins]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Charles Fleischer]], [[Stubby Kaye]], and [[Joanna Cassidy]]. Combining live-action and animation, the film is set in [[Hollywood]] during the late 1940s, where [[animated character]]s and people co-exist. The story follows Eddie Valiant, a private detective who must exonerate "Toon" (i.e. cartoon character) Roger Rabbit, who is accused of murdering a wealthy businessman.

[[Walt Disney Pictures]] purchased the film rights for ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit''{{'}}s story in 1981. Price and Seaman wrote two drafts of the script before Disney brought in executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]], and his production company, [[Amblin Entertainment]]. Zemeckis was brought on to direct the film, and Canadian animator [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] was hired to supervise the animation sequences. Production was moved from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Elstree Studios]] in England to accommodate Williams and his group of animators. While filming, the production budget began to rapidly expand and the shooting schedule ran longer than expected.

Disney released the film through its [[Touchstone Pictures]] division on June 22, 1988, to critical and commercial success, becoming a [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]. The film brought a renewed interest in the [[Golden Age of American animation]], spearheading [[modern animation in the United States|modern American animation]] and the [[Disney Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Susan|title=Classic Hollywood: On the case of 'Roger Rabbit'|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-roger-rabbit-classic-hollywood-20130401,0,7123062,full.story|accessdate=April 16, 2013|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the film was selected for the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 to 700 words only. --&gt;
In 1947 [[Los Angeles]], "[[Animated cartoon|toons]]" act in theatrical cartoon shorts as with live-action films; they regularly interact with real people and animals and reside in Toontown, a fictional place where animated cartoon characters (toons) reside. Private detective Eddie Valiant and his brother, Teddy, once worked closely with the toons on several famous cases, but after Teddy was killed by a toon, Eddie lapsed into alcoholism and vowed never to work for toons again.

R.K. Maroon, head of Maroon Cartoon Studios, is concerned about the recent poor performances of one of his biggest stars, [[Roger Rabbit]]. Maroon hires Valiant to investigate rumors about Roger's voluptuous toon wife [[Jessica Rabbit|Jessica]] being romantically involved with businessman and gadget inventor Marvin Acme, owner of both [[Acme Corporation]] and Toontown. After watching Jessica perform at the underground Ink and Paint Club, Valiant secretly photographs her and Acme playing [[patty-cake]] in her dressing room, which he shows to Roger. Maroon suggests to Roger that he should leave Jessica, but a drunken Roger refuses and flees.

The next morning, Acme is discovered dead at his factory by the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] with a safe dropped on his head, and evidence points to Roger being responsible. While investigating, Valiant meets [[Judge Doom]], Toontown's superior court judge, who has created a substance capable of killing a toon: a toxic "dip" made of [[turpentine]], [[acetone]], and [[benzene]]. Valiant runs into Roger's toon co-star, [[List of Who Framed Roger Rabbit characters#Baby Herman|Baby Herman]], who believes Roger is innocent and that Acme's missing will, which will give the toons ownership of Toontown, may be the key to his murder. Valiant finds Roger, who begs him to help exonerate him, hiding in his office. Valiant reluctantly hides Roger in a local bar, where his ex-girlfriend, Dolores, works. Jessica approaches Valiant and says that Maroon forced her to pose for the photographs so he could blackmail Acme.

Doom and his toon weasel henchmen discover Roger, but he and Valiant escape with Benny, an [[anthropomorphic]] taxicab. They flee to a theater, where Valiant tells Roger that a toon killed Teddy when they were investigating a bank robbery by dropping a piano on his head. As they leave with Dolores, Valiant sees a newsreel detailing the sale of Maroon Cartoons to Cloverleaf, a mysterious corporation that bought the city's trolley network shortly before Acme's murder. Valiant goes to the studio to confront Maroon, leaving Roger to guard outside, but Jessica knocks Roger out and puts him in the trunk. Maroon tells Valiant that he blackmailed Acme into selling his company so he could sell the studio, then tearfully admits he only did so out of fear for the safety of the toons and is killed before he can explain the consequences of the missing will. Valiant spots Jessica fleeing the scene, and assuming she is the culprit, follows her into Toontown. Jessica reveals that Doom killed Acme and Maroon and that Acme gave her his will for safekeeping, but she discovered that the will was blank. She and Valiant are captured by Doom and the weasels.

At the Acme factory, Doom reveals his plot to destroy Toontown with a machine loaded with dip to build a freeway, the only way past Toontown since Cloverleaf (which Doom owns) has bought out Los Angeles' [[Pacific Electric Railway]]. Roger unsuccessfully attempts to save Jessica, and the couple is tied onto a hook in front of the machine's hose. Valiant performs a comedic [[vaudeville]] act, causing the weasels to [[Death from laughter|die of laughter]]; Valiant kicks their leader into the machine's dip vat, killing him. Valiant fights Doom, who is flattened by a steamroller, but survives, revealing him as a toon. Doom reveals that he killed Teddy. Valiant uses a toon mallet with a spring-loaded boxing glove and fires it at a switch that causes the machine to empty its dip onto Doom, dissolving him to death.

The empty machine crashes through the wall into Toontown, where it is destroyed by a train. Toons run in to regard Doom's remains, and Roger discovers that he inadvertently wrote his love letter for Jessica on Acme's will, which was written in [[invisible ink|disappearing/reappearing ink]]. Roger shocks Valiant with a [[joy buzzer]], and Valiant gives him a kiss, having regained his sense of humor. Valiant happily enters Toontown with Dolores, and Roger with Jessica, followed by the other toons.

==Characters==
{{main|Roger Rabbit|Jessica Rabbit|Judge Doom}}
The main characters of the film are [[Roger Rabbit]], a cartoon rabbit, his cartoon-human wife [[Jessica Rabbit]], and human detective [[Eddie Valiant]] and [[Judge Doom]].

Other characters in the film include:

'''Baby Herman''' is Roger's major co-star in the animated shorts in which they appear. He is Roger's best friend. Baby Herman's "mother", Mrs. Herman (voiced by [[April Winchell]]), makes an appearance at the beginning of ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' and its spin-off short films, but she is only shown from the waist down.

Baby Herman and Roger Rabbit comprised an [[Abbott and Costello]]-like comedy team for the fictitious [[Maroon Cartoons]] studio in the 1940s. A typical Roger/Baby Herman cartoon consists of Roger being given responsibility for Baby Herman's well-being; Herman immediately begins crawling through a number of dangerous situations from which Roger must rescue him. In the process, Roger suffers extravagant injuries and humiliations reminiscent of those in classic [[Tex Avery]] cartoons, while Baby Herman remains unscathed. For both book adaptations, Baby Herman was murdered, leaving behind a doppelganger for Eddie Valiant to help solve the crime.

In the film, Baby Herman's role was downplayed. In one scene, he tells Eddie that Roger did not murder Marvin Acme and tips off that Acme had a will that promised to leave Toontown to the Toons, which is the reason why Acme was killed. Baby Herman later appears at the end of the film, expressing his annoyance that Acme did not leave his will where it could easily be found.

Despite his name and appearance, "Baby" Herman is actually a middle-aged, cigar-smoking Toon who looks like an infant. While filming "in character", he speaks [[baby talk]] in a typical baby boy's voice provided by Winchell; off-camera, he has a loud, gravelly voice provided by [[Lou Hirsch]]. Animation director [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] loved the character of "adult" Baby Herman so much that he personally animated all of the scenes of the character in the film. When he loses his cigar and finds himself unable to reach it, he starts crying like a baby (albeit with his voice still sounding like a middle-aged man).

'''Benny the Cab''' is a [[taxicab]] that services the Los Angeles area in the film ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit''. He is voiced in all appearances by [[Charles Fleischer]]. In the original story, ''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]'', a different character named Bennie is an insect who deals in second-hand items at the junkyard. The character was expanded for the movie, as an anthropomorphized colorful yellow [[Volkswagen Beetle]]-style taxi cab.

The '''Toon Patrol''' is a group of five [[anthropomorphic]] animated tailless [[weasel]]s who serve as [[henchmen]] to Judge Doom in ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit''. They serve as the secondary antagonists of the film. In the film, the Toon Patrol comprises the "[[police officer]]s" of Toontown, but they behave less like law enforcers and more like gangsters and crooks. Judge Doom hires them to capture Roger Rabbit for the [[murder]] of Marvin Acme. The Toon Patrol drives around in a black [[Dodge|Dodge Humpback]] [[paddy wagon]] labeled with the Los Angeles city seal like with cruisers of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]].

The weasels [[schadenfreude|enjoy laughing at the misery of others]], including each other. Like all the other Toons in the movie, they are invincible to physical body harm except for the dip. However, prolonged laughter is also shown to be [[Death from laughter|lethal to them]]. Eddie Valiant jokes around in front of them during the climax of the movie, causing all but Smartass to "die" from laughing at him, after which their Toon souls rise to heaven in angel forms. According to Judge Doom, they once had [[hyena]] cousins that died in the same manner.

While being designed, the weasels and their fondness of weapons were modeled after the weasels in the 1949 [[Disney]] cartoon ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''. The weasels make an appearance in the [[Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin]] attraction located at [[Disneyland]] and [[Tokyo Disneyland]].

'''Dolores''' ([[Joanna Cassidy]]) is [[Eddie Valiant]]'s girlfriend who works as a [[Waiting staff|waitress]] in a bar. She is involved in helping Eddie solve the case against Judge Doom.

'''R.K. Maroon''' ([[Alan Tilvern]]) is the owner of [[Maroon Cartoons]]. He paid Eddie $100 to photograph Jessica and Marvin Acme, which eventually led to Acme's murder. Maroon later admitted that he was trying to blackmail Acme into selling Toontown to Cloverleaf Industries so that he could sell his studio as well, since Cloverleaf wanted to buy both properties at once. Before he could reveal who was behind the plot, he was shot and killed by Judge Doom.

'''Marvin Acme''' ([[Stubby Kaye]]) is the owner of Acme Products and Toontown. He is known around Hollywood as "the gag king" for the prank items he makes his living selling. Among his top sellers are Disappearing/Reappearing Ink and a hand buzzer. In a blackmail scheme by R.K. Maroon, he has an "affair" with Toon Jessica Rabbit which Eddie Valiant (who briefly meets Acme) photographs. Acme is murdered later that night by Judge Doom, who drops a safe on his head and frames Jessica's husband, Roger.

'''Lt. Santino''' ([[Richard LeParmentier]]) is a lieutenant with the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]], and friend of Eddie. He accompanies Eddie to the Acme factory, where Marvin Acme has been murdered and everyone suspects Roger. Here they are introduced to Judge Doom who explains the ingredients of the Dip. When Doom demonstrates the Dip on a defenceless Toon shoe, Santino turns away in distress, unable to watch the Toon die. Santino is present with several officers when Eddie discovers that it was Doom who killed Acme along with Maroon and Teddy.

'''Theodore "Teddy" J. Valiant''' is the deceased brother of Eddie. Teddy was killed by a piano dropped onto him by a Toon later revealed to be Judge Doom while investigating a robbery in Toontown. Due to his brother's death, Eddie, with whom Teddy had cracked many a case and helped Toons who were in trouble, vowed never to work for a Toon again and wouldn't for many years. To honor his brother, Eddie left Teddy's desk the way it was the day he died and refuses to allow anyone to sit at it. Eddie avenged his brother's death when he destroyed Doom with Doom's Dip.

'''Angelo''' ([[Richard Ridings]]) is a client of Dolores's bar. Eddie is not particularly fond of Angelo, as he makes fun of Eddie for his detective work. Eddie regards Angelo as the kind of guy who would sell someone out at the first opportunity, but Angelo helps Roger avoid Judge Doom's search after Roger makes him laugh. When asked by Doom if he has seen a rabbit, Angelo mocks him by gesturing to a patch of empty space and saying, "Say hello to the Judge, Harvey." - a reference to [[Harvey (play)|the 1944 play of that name]] by [[Mary Coyle Chase]].

'''Bongo''' (voiced by Morgan Deare, [[Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin]] voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]]) is a cartoon [[gorilla]] [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] of The Ink and Paint Club. The password that Eddie uses to get in was "[[Walt Disney|Walt]] sent me" and Bongo lets him in. He also tosses Eddie out of the club when he catches Eddie spying on Jessica Rabbit and Marvin P. Acme in Jessica's dressing room.

'''Lena Hyena''' is a Toon [[Hag]] that resembles Jessica Rabbit. When Eddie was looking for Jessica Rabbit, he saw what appeared to be her in an apartment building. When Eddie entered the room, he encountered Lena Hyena who developed a crush on Eddie and chased him around parts of Toon Town. Eddie was able to get rid of her by tricking her into running into the wall of a building.

The '''Toon Bullets''' are a group of six bullets with personalities similar to those of characters in Western movies. They were a present from [[Yosemite Sam]], thanking Eddie for "springing him from the hoosegow."

When Eddie Valiant decides to enter Toontown in pursuit of Judge Doom, he discards his pistol in favor of an oversized Toon revolver and loads the bullets into it. He fires at Doom, but the bullets become confused as to where he went and turn in the wrong direction. "Dum-dums," Eddie says sourly.  (This is a wordplay insofar as dum-dums are a type of bullet, specifically ones which are hollow-nosed or soft-nosed.)

==Production==
===Development===
[[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] purchased the [[film rights]] to [[Gary K. Wolf]]'s novel ''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]'' shortly after its publication in 1981. [[Ron W. Miller]], then president of Disney, saw it as a perfect opportunity to produce a [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]].&lt;ref name="War"&gt;Stewart, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman]] were hired to write the script, penning two drafts. [[Robert Zemeckis]] offered his services as director in 1982,&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;{{cite book | author = Norman Kagan | title = The Cinema of Robert Zemeckis |date = May 2003| publisher = [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] | location = Lanham, Maryland | chapter = Who Framed Roger Rabbit | pages = 93–117 | isbn = 0-87833-293-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Disney declined as his two previous films (''[[I Wanna Hold Your Hand (film)|I Wanna Hold Your Hand]]'' and ''[[Used Cars]]'') had been [[box-office bomb]]s.&lt;ref name="comment"&gt;Robert Zemeckis, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, Ken Ralston, [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], Steve Starkey, DVD audio commentary, 2003, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1981 and 1983 Disney developed test footage with [[Darrell Van Citters]] as animation director, [[Paul Reubens]] voicing Roger Rabbit, [[Peter Renaday]] as Eddie Valiant, and [[Russi Taylor]] as Jessica Rabbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author =TheThiefArchive|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yxyGZNS4|title=Early unmade version of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" [Paul Reubens, Darrell Van Citters, Disney 1983]|publisher=YouTube|date=September 5, 2014|accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was revamped in 1985 by [[Michael Eisner]], the then-new CEO of Disney. [[Amblin Entertainment]], which consisted of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]] and [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]], were approached to produce ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' alongside Disney. The original budget was projected at $50 million, which Disney felt was too expensive.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book | author= [[James B. Stewart]] | title = [[DisneyWar]] | publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year =2005 | location = New York City | page = 86 | isbn = 0-684-80993-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Roger Rabbit'' was finally [[Green-light|green-lit]] when the budget decreased to $30 million, which at the time still made it the most expensive animated film ever green-lit.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt; [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] argued that the hybrid of live action and animation would "save" Disney's [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|animation department]]. Spielberg's contract included an extensive amount of creative control and a large percentage of the [[box-office]] profits. Disney kept all merchandising rights.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt; Spielberg convinced [[Warner Bros.]], [[Fleischer Studios]], [[King Features Syndicate]], [[Felix the Cat|Felix the Cat Productions]], [[Turner Entertainment]], and [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]/[[Walter Lantz Productions]] to "lend" their characters to appear in the film with (in some cases) stipulations on how those characters were portrayed; for example, Disney's Donald Duck and Warner's Daffy Duck appear as equally talented dueling pianists, and Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny also share a scene. Apart from this agreement, Warner Bros. and the various other companies were not involved in the production of ''Roger Rabbit''. Additionally, the producers were unable to acquire the rights to use [[Popeye]], [[Tom and Jerry]], [[Little Lulu]], [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]], or the [[Terrytoons]] for appearances from their respective owners (King Features, Turner, [[Western Publishing]], [[Harvey Comics]], and [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]).&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="comment" /&gt;

[[Terry Gilliam]] was offered the chance to direct, but he found the project too technically challenging. ("Pure laziness on my part," he later admitted, "I completely regret that decision.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Ian Nathan | title = Dreams: Terry Gilliam's Unresolved Projects | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date = May 1996| pages = 37–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Zemeckis was hired to direct in 1985, based on the success of ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' and ''Back to the Future''. Disney executives were continuing to suggest Darrell Van Citters to direct the animated sequences, but Spielberg and Zemeckis decided against it.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt; Richard Williams was eventually hired to direct the animation. Zemeckis wanted the film to imbue "Disney's high quality of animation, Warner Bros.' characterization, and [[Tex Avery]] humor".&lt;ref name="WakingSB"&gt;[[Don Hahn]], [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]], ''Waking Sleeping Beauty'' DVD commentary, 2010, [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
[[Harrison Ford]] was Spielberg's original choice to play Eddie Valiant, but Ford's price was too high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/harrison-ford-lost-roles/4/|title=‘Who Framed Roger Rabbit?’ And Six Other Big Roles Harrison Ford Missed Out On|date=July 13, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Murray]] was also considered for the part, but due to his idiosyncratic method of receiving offers for roles, Murray missed out on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-farr/bill-murray-and-the-roles_b_5850434.html|title=Bill Murray and the Roles That Got Away|first=John|last=Farr|date=September 19, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eddie Murphy]] reportedly turned down the role of Eddie, which he later came to regret.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Eddie Murphy|date=7 April 2011|publisher=[[Splitsider]]|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/04/the-lost-roles-of-eddie-murphy/|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other actors were also considered for the role of Eddie Valiant, including [[Chevy Chase]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[Ed Harris]], [[Charles Grodin]], and [[Don Lane]].&lt;ref name="mentalfloss.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/62910/15-things-you-might-not-know-about-who-framed-roger-rabbit|title=15 Things You Might Not Know About ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit''|date=April 10, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate Hoskins' performance, [[Charles Fleischer]] dressed in a Roger bunny suit and "stood in" behind camera for most scenes.&lt;ref name="ears" /&gt; Animation director Williams explained Roger Rabbit was a combination of "[[Tex Avery]]'s cashew nut-shaped head, the swatch of red hair...like [[Droopy]]'s, [[Goofy]]'s overalls, [[Porky Pig]]'s bow tie, [[Mickey Mouse]]'s gloves, and [[Bugs Bunny]]-like cheeks and ears."&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt;

[[Kathleen Turner]] provided the uncredited voice of [[Jessica Rabbit]], Roger Rabbit's Toon wife.&lt;ref name="kt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/kathleen-turner-talks-the-perfect-family-body-heat,73499/ | title=Kathleen Turner talks ''The Perfect Family'', ''Body Heat'', and her return to cinema | publisher=[[The Onion]] | work=[[The A.V. Club]] | date=May 4, 2012 | accessdate=November 24, 2012 | author=Rabin, Nathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Lloyd]] was cast because he previously worked with Zemeckis and Spielberg on ''[[Back to the Future]]''. Lloyd compared his part as Doom to his previous role as the Klingon commander Kruge in ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'', both being overly evil characters which he considered being "fun to play".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/articles/random-roles-christopher-lloyd,86582/ | title = Christopher Lloyd on playing a vampire, a taxi driver, a toon, and more | publisher = [[The A.V.

Fleischer also voiced Benny the Cab and two members of Doom's weasel gang, Psycho and Greasy. Lou Hirsch, who supplied the voice for Baby Herman, was the original choice for Benny the Cab, but was replaced by Fleischer.&lt;ref name="ears"&gt;Robert Zemeckis, Richard Williams, [[Bob Hoskins]], [[Charles Fleischer]], [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], [[Alan Silvestri]], Ken Ralston, ''Behind the Ears: The True Story of Roger Rabbit'', 2003, [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
[[File:PELogoBW.svg|thumb|200px|alt=Pacific Electric Logo|The plot incorporated the actual closing of [[Pacific Electric]].]]
Price and Seaman were brought aboard to continue writing the script once Spielberg and Zemeckis were hired. For inspiration, the two writers studied the work of [[Walt Disney]] and [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] from the Golden Age of American animation, especially Tex Avery and [[Bob Clampett]] cartoons. The Cloverleaf streetcar subplot was inspired by ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''.&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; Price and Seaman said that "the [[Red Car]] plot, [[suburb]] expansion, [[urban culture|urban]] and [[political corruption]] really did happen," Price stated. "In Los Angeles, during the 1940s, car and tire companies [[Great American streetcar scandal|teamed up]] against the [[Pacific Electric Railway]] system and bought them out of business. Where the [[freeway]] runs in Los Angeles is where the Red Car used to be."&lt;ref name="comment"/&gt; In Wolf's novel ''Who Censored Roger Rabbit?'', the toons were [[comic-strip]] characters rather than movie stars.&lt;ref name="Norman"/&gt;

During the writing process, Price and Seaman were unsure of whom to include as the villain in the plot. They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain, but they made their final decision with newly created character Judge Doom. Doom was supposed to have an animated vulture sit on his shoulder, but this was deleted due to the technical challenges this posed.&lt;ref name="comment"/&gt; Doom would also have a suitcase of 12 small animated kangaroos that [[Kangaroo court|act as a jury]], by having their [[Joey (marsupial)#Early development|joeys]] pop out of their pouches, each with letters, when put together would spell YOU ARE GUILTY. This was also cut for budget and technical reasons.&lt;ref name="script"&gt;Who Shot Roger Rabbit, 1986 script by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman&lt;/ref&gt; Doom's five-man weasel gang (Stupid, Smart Ass, Greasy, Wheezy, and Psycho) satirizes the Seven Dwarfs (Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey), who appeared in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937). Originally, seven weasels were to mimic the dwarf's complement, but eventually, two of them, Slimey and Slezey, were written out of the script.&lt;ref name="comment"/&gt; Further references included The "Ink and Paint Club" resembling the [[Cotton Club (New York City)|Harlem Cotton Club]], while Zemeckis compared Judge Doom's invention of "the dip" to eliminate all the toons as [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Final Solution]].&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; Doom was originally the hunter who killed [[Bambi]]'s mother.&lt;ref name="script"/&gt; Benny the Cab was first conceived to be a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] before being changed to a [[taxicab]]. Ideas originally conceived for the story also included a sequence set at Marvin Acme's funeral, whose attendees included Eddie, Foghorn Leghorn, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Tom and Jerry, [[Heckle and Jeckle]], [[Chip n' Dale]], [[Mighty Mouse]], [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]], Popeye, [[Olive Oyl]], [[Bluto]], [[Clarabelle Cow]], and the Seven Dwarfs in [[cameo appearance]]s. However, the scene was cut for pacing reasons and never made it past the storyboard stage.&lt;ref name="script"/&gt; Before finally agreeing on ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' as the film's title, [[working title]]s included ''Murder in Toontown'', ''Toons'', ''Dead Toons Don't Pay Bills'', ''The Toontown Trial'', ''Trouble in Toontown'', and ''Eddie Goes to Toontown''.&lt;ref&gt;DVD production notes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Judgedoom.PNG|thumb|Judge Doom ([[Christopher Lloyd]]) threatens Roger Rabbit before introducing him to the dip. [[Mime artist]]s, [[puppeteer]]s, [[mannequin]]s, and [[robotic arm]]s were commonly used during filming to help the actors interact with "open air and imaginative cartoon characters".&lt;ref name="ears" /&gt;]]

Animation director Richard Williams admitted he was "openly disdainful of the Disney [[bureaucracy]]"&lt;ref name="Katz" /&gt; and refused to work in Los Angeles. To accommodate him and his animators, production was moved to [[Elstree Studios]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England. Disney and Spielberg also told Williams that in return for doing ''Roger Rabbit'', they would help distribute his uncompleted film ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]''.&lt;ref name="Katz" /&gt; Supervising animators included [[Dale Baer]], [[James Baxter (animator)|James Baxter]], [[David Bowers (director)|David Bowers]], [[Andreas Deja]], [[Chris Jenkins (film producer)|Chris Jenkins]], [[Phil Nibbelink]], [[Nik Ranieri]], and [[Simon Wells]]. The animation production, headed by associate producer [[Don Hahn]], was split between Richard Williams' London studio and a specialized unit in Los Angeles, set up by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] and supervised by Dale Baer.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Scott (2008). "[https://archive.is/20120908053504/http://www.mouseclubhouse.com/Interviews/don-hahn/don-hahn-beauty-roger-rabbit.htm DON HAHN talks about 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?']". ''Mouseclubhouse.com''. Retrieved December 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The production budget continued to escalate, while the shooting schedule lapsed longer than expected. When the budget reached $40 million, Disney president [[Michael Eisner]] seriously considered shutting down production, but [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] talked him out of it.&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;Stewart, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the budget escalating to over $50 million, Disney moved forward on production because they were enthusiastic to work with Spielberg.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;

[[VistaVision]] cameras installed with [[motion-control]] technology were used for the photography of the live-action scenes which would be composited with animation. Rubber mannequins of Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman, and the weasels would portray the animated characters during rehearsals to teach the actors where to look when acting with "open air and imaginative cartoon characters".&lt;ref name="ears" /&gt; Many of the live-action props held by cartoon characters were shot on set with either robotic arms holding the props or the props were manipulated by strings, similar to a [[marionette]].&lt;ref name="comment" /&gt; The actor who played the voice of Roger, Charles Fleischer, insisted on wearing a Roger Rabbit costume while on the set, to get into character.&lt;ref name="ears" /&gt; [[Principal photography|Filming]] began on December 2, 1986, and lasted for seven months at Elstree Studios, with an additional month in Los Angeles and at [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] (ILM) for [[Chroma key|blue screen]] effects of Toontown. The entrance of [[Ren-Mar Studios|Desilu Studios]] served as the fictional Maroon Cartoon Studio lot.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], [[Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman|Jeffrey Price]], [[Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman|Peter Seaman]], [[Steve Starkey]], and [[Ken Ralston]]. ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit - Blu-ray audio commentary'', 2013, [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animation and post-production===
[[Post-production]] lasted for 14 months.&lt;ref name="comment" /&gt; Because the film was made before [[computer animation]] and [[digital compositing]] were widely used, all the animation was done using [[cel]]s and [[Optical printer|optical compositing]].&lt;ref name="ears" /&gt; First, the animators and lay-out artists were given black-and-white printouts of the live-action scenes (known as "photo stats"), and they placed their animation paper on top of them. The artists then drew the animated characters in relationship to the live-action footage. Due to Zemeckis' dynamic camera moves, the animators had to confront the challenge of ensuring the characters were not "slipping and slipping all over the place."&lt;ref name="ears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="comment" /&gt; After rough animation was complete, it was run through the normal process of traditional animation until the cels were shot on the [[rostrum camera]] with no background. The animated footage was then sent to ILM for compositing, where technicians animated three lighting layers (shadows, highlights, and tone mattes) separately,  to make the cartoon characters look three-dimensional and give the illusion of the characters being affected by the lighting on set.&lt;ref name="ears" /&gt; Finally, the lighting effects were optically composited on to the cartoon characters, who were, in turn, composited into the live-action footage. One of the most difficult effects in the film was Jessica's dress in the nightclub scene, because it had flashing [[sequin]]s, an effect accomplished by filtering light through a [[plastic bag]] scratched with [[steel wool]].&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt;

Disney]], Vice Chairman of the Walt Disney Company, felt ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' was too risqué with sexual references.&lt;ref name="Mickey" /&gt; Eisner and Zemeckis disagreed over various elements of the film, but since Zemeckis had [[final cut privilege]], he refused to make alterations.&lt;ref name="ears" /&gt; Roy E. Disney, head of Feature Animation along with studio chief [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], felt it was appropriate to release the film under their [[Touchstone Pictures]] banner instead of the traditional [[Walt Disney Pictures]] banner.&lt;ref name="Mickey" /&gt;

''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' opened in the United States on June 22, 1988, grossing $11,226,239 in 1,045 theaters during its opening weekend, ranking first place in the domestic box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1988&amp;wknd=26&amp;p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for June 24-26, 1988 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | date=June 27, 1988 | accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film went on to gross $156,452,370 in North America and $173,351,588 internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $329,803,958.

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film four stars out of four, predicting it would carry "the type of [[word of mouth]] that money can't buy. This movie is not only great entertainment, but [also] a breakthrough in craftsmanship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Roger Ebert]] | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19880622/REVIEWS/806220301/1023 | title = Who Framed Roger Rabbit | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = June 22, 1988 | accessdate = November 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert and his colleague [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' spent a considerable amount of time in the ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel &amp; Ebert]]'' episode in which they reviewed the film analyzing the film's painstaking filmmaking. Siskel also praised the film, and ranked it number two on his top-ten films list for 1988, while Ebert ranked it as number eight on a similar list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Ebert | first=Roger | date=December 31, 1988 | title=The Best 10 Movies of 1988 | publisher=''Roger Ebert's Journal'' | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/the-best-10-movies-of-1988 | access-date=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented, "although this isn't the first time that cartoon characters have shared the screen with live actors, it's the first time they've done it on their own terms and make it look real".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Janet Maslin]] | title = Who Framed Roger Rabbit | work = [[The New York Times]] | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DEFDD163FF931A15755C0A96E948260 |date = June 22, 1988 | accessdate = June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desson Thomson]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' considered ''Roger Rabbit'' to be "a definitive collaboration of pure talent. Zemeckis had Walt Disney Pictures' enthusiastic backing, producer Steven Spielberg's pull, Warner Bros.'s blessing, Canadian animator Richard Williams' ink and paint, Mel Blanc's voice, Jeffrey Price and Peter S.

[[Richard Corliss]], writing for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', gave a mixed review. "The opening cartoon works just fine but too fine. The opening scene upstages the movie that emerges from it," he said. Corliss was mainly annoyed by the [[Homage (arts)|homages]] to the [[Golden Age of American animation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Richard Corliss]] | title = Creatures of A Subhuman Species | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967766,00.html | format = Registration required to read article | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = June 27, 1988 | accessdate = November 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animation legend [[Chuck Jones]] made a rather scathing attack on the film in his book ''Chuck Jones Conversations''. Among his complaints, Jones accused Robert Zemeckis of robbing Richard Williams of any creative input and ruining the piano duel that both Williams and he storyboarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Furniss | first=Maureen | authorlink=Maureen Furniss | date=2005 | title=Chuck Jones: Conversations | pages=152–153 | series=Conversations with Comic Artists | location=Jackson, Miss. | publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]] | isbn=1-578067-2-86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' rekindled an interest in the Golden Age of American animation, and sparked the modern animation scene.&lt;ref name="Gore" /&gt; In 1991, [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] began to develop [[Mickey's Toontown]] for [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]], based on the Toontown that appeared in the film. The attraction also features a ride called [[Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin]].&lt;ref name="Mickey"&gt;Stewart, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Three [[Roger Rabbit short films|theatrical animated shorts]] were also produced: ''[[Tummy Trouble]]'', played in front of ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]''; ''[[Roller Coaster Rabbit]]'' was shown with ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''; and ''[[Trail Mix-Up]]'' was included with ''[[A Far Off Place]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Aljean Harmetz | title = Marketing Magic, With ''Rabbit'', for Disney Films | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = July 19, 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maria"&gt;{{cite news | author = Maria Eftimiades | title = It's Heigh Ho, as Disney Calls the Toons to Work | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = April 29, 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also inspired a short-lived comic-book and video-game [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], including [[Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988 video game)|two]] [[Hare Raising Havoc|PC games]], the Japanese version of ''[[The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle]]'' (which features Roger instead of Bugs), a [[Who Framed Roger Rabbit (NES game)|1989 game]] released on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], and a [[Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1991 video game)|1991 game]] released on the [[Game Boy]].&lt;ref name="Maria" /&gt;

In December 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-16-209/with-20000-leagues-the-national-film-registry-reaches-700/2016-12-14/|title=With "20,000 Leagues," the National Film Registry Reaches 700|publisher=|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
With the film's [[LaserDisc]] release, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' first reported in March 1994 that observers uncovered several scenes of antics from the animators that supposedly featured brief nudity of the Jessica Rabbit character. While undetectable when played at the usual rate of 24 [[film frame]]s per second, the Laserdisc player allowed the viewer to advance frame-by-frame to uncover these visuals. Whether or not they were actually intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No Underwear Under There|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-03-22/features/9403220085_1_frames-viewers-jessica-rabbit|accessdate=August 18, 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=March 22, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = https://variety.com/1994/voices/columns/jessica-rabbit-revealed-119154/ | title = Jessica Rabbit revealed | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = March 14, 1994 | accessdate = November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many retailers said that within minutes of the Laserdisc debut, their entire inventory was sold out. The run was fueled by media reports about the controversy, including stories on [[CNN]] and various newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Adam Sandler | url = https://variety.com/1994/digital/features/rabbit-frames-feed-flap-119269/ | title = ''Rabbit'' frames feed flap | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = March 16, 1994 | accessdate = November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another frequently debated scene includes one in which Baby Herman [[the finger|extends his middle finger]] as he passes under a woman's dress and re-emerges with drool on his lip.&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Snopes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snopes.com/disney/films/jessica.asp#add|title=Naked Jessica Rabbit|publisher=[[Snopes.com]]|accessdate=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, controversy exists over the scene where Daffy Duck and Donald Duck are playing a piano duel, and during his trademark ranting gibberish, it is claimed that Donald calls Daffy a "goddamn stupid [[nigger]]"; however, this is a misinterpretation, with the line from the script being "doggone stubborn little—."&lt;ref name="Schweizer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schweizer|first=Peter|last2=Schweizer |first2= Rochelle|title= Disney: The Mouse Betrayed.|publisher=Regnery|year=1998|pages=143 &amp; 144|isbn=0-89526-387-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snopes.com/disney/films/donald.asp|title=Quacking Wise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Dave|title=[[Disney A to Z: The Official Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal issue===
Gary K. Wolf, author of the novel ''Who Censored Roger Rabbit?'', filed a lawsuit in 2001 against the Walt Disney Company. Wolf claimed he was owed royalties based on the value of "gross receipts" and merchandising sales. In 2002, the trial court in the case ruled that these only referred to actual cash receipts Disney collected and denied Wolf's claim. In its January 2004 ruling, the California Court of Appeal disagreed, finding that expert testimony introduced by Wolf regarding the customary use of "gross receipts" in the entertainment business could support a broader reading of the term. The ruling vacated the trial court's order in favor of Disney and remanded the case for further proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Paul Sweeting | title = Disney, ''Roger Rabbit'' author in spat | work = Video Business | date = February 5, 2004 | url = http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA614737.html | accessdate = November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 2005 hearing, Wolf estimated he was owed $7 million.

===Proposed sequel===
Spielberg discussed a sequel in 1989 with [[J. J. Abrams]] as writer and Zemeckis as producer. Abrams's outline was eventually abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | author1 = [[J. J.

Similar to the previous film, ''Toon Platoon'' featured many cameo appearances by characters from the Golden Age of American animation. It began with Roger Rabbit's early years, living on a farm in the midwestern United States.&lt;ref name="Gore" /&gt; With human Ritchie Davenport, Roger travels west to seek his mother, in the process meeting Jessica Krupnick (his future wife), a struggling Hollywood actress. While Roger and Ritchie are enlisting in the Army, Jessica is kidnapped and forced to make pro-Nazi Germany broadcasts. Roger and Ritchie must save her by going into Nazi-occupied Europe accompanied by several other Toons in their Army platoon. After their triumph, Roger and Ritchie are given a Hollywood Boulevard parade, and Roger is finally reunited with his mother, and father: [[Bugs Bunny]].&lt;ref name="Gore"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Chris Gore]] | title = The 50 Greatest Movies Never Made |date = July 1999| publisher = [[St. Martin's Press]] | location = New York City | chapter = Roger Rabbit Two: The Toon Platoon | pages = 165–168 | isbn = 0-312-20082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.filmbuffonline.com/FBOLNewsreel/wordpress/2005/08/07/script-review-roger-rabbit-ii-the-toon-platoon/ | title = Script Review: Roger Rabbit II: Toon Platoon | work = FilmBuffOnline.com | accessdate = September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mauldin later retitled his script ''Who Discovered Roger Rabbit''.

Although they kept Roger's search for his mother, Stoner and Oliver replaced the WWII subplot with Roger's inadvertent rise to stardom on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and Hollywood. Disney was impressed and [[Alan Menken]] was hired to write five songs for the film and offered his services as executive producer.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; One of the songs, "This Only Happens in the Movies", was recorded in 2008 on the debut album of Broadway actress [[Kerry Butler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=25560 | title = Kerry Butler's 'Faith, Trust and Pixie Dust' Set For May Release | work = Broadway World | date = February 28, 2008 | accessdate = November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Goldberg (film director)|Eric Goldberg]] was set to be the new animation director, and began to redesign Roger's new character appearance.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt;

Spielberg became busy establishing [[DreamWorks]], while Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy decided to remain as producers. Test footage for ''Who Discovered Roger Rabbit'' was shot sometime in 1998 at the Disney animation unit in [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida]]; the results were a mix of CGI, traditional animation, and live-action that did not please Disney. A second test had the Toons completely converted to [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]]; but this was dropped as the film's projected budget would escalate past $100 million. Eisner felt it was best to cancel the film.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt; In March 2003, producer [[Don Hahn]] was doubtful about a sequel being made, arguing that public tastes had changed since the 1990s with the rise of computer animation.

He stated, "Yeah, I couldn't possibly comment. I deny completely, but yeah... if you're a fan, pretty soon you're going to be very, very, very happy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=28191 |title=Exclusive: The Lion King To Go 3D! &amp;#124; Movie News &amp;#124; Empire |publisher=Empireonline.com |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[Bob Hoskins]] stated he was interested in the project, reprising his role as Eddie Valiant.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} However, he retired from acting in 2012 after being diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] a year earlier, and died from complications in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2012-08-08/bob-hoskins-retires-from-acting/ |title=Bob Hoskins retires from acting |publisher=Itv.com |date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall has confirmed that the film is a prequel, similar to earlier drafts, and that the writing was almost complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/frank-marshall-roger-rabbit-2-sequel-bourne-legacy/187006/ |title=Frank Marshall Talks WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT 2 Sequel, THE BOURNE LEGACY, THE GOONIES 2, More |publisher=Collider |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview at the premiere of ''[[Flight (2012 film)|Flight]]'', Zemeckis stated that the sequel was still possible, despite Hoskins' absence, and the script for the sequel was sent to Disney for approval from studio executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Russ|title=Despite Bob Hoskins' Retirement, the 'Roger Rabbit' Sequel is Still Possible|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/despite-bob-hoskins-retirement-the-roger-rabbit-sequel-is-still-possible/|publisher=[[SlashFilm|/Film]]|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Gary K. Wolf, writer of the original novel, said Erik Von Wodtke and he were working on a development proposal for an animated Disney buddy comedy starring Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit called ''The Stooge'', based on [[The Stooge|the 1952 film of the same name]]. The proposed film is set to a prequel, taking place five years before ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' and part of the story is about how Roger met Jessica, his future wife. Wolf has stated the film is currently wending its way through Disney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=30567 |title=• View topic - Mickey Mouse &amp; Roger Rabbit in The Stooge |publisher=Dvdizzy.com |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, while promoting his latest film, ''[[Allied (film)|Allied]]'', in England, Zemeckis stated that the sequel "moves the story of Roger and Jessica Rabbit into the next few years of period film, moving on from film noir to the world of the 1950s". He also stated that the sequel would feature a "digital Bob Hoskins", as Eddie Valiant would return in "ghost form". While the director went on to state that the script is "terrific" and the film would still use hand-drawn animation, Zemeckis thinks that the chances of Disney green-lighting the sequel are "slim". As he explained more in detail, "The current corporate Disney culture [the current studio management of [[The Walt Disney Company]]] has no interest in Roger, and they certainly don't like Jessica at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brew|first=Simon|title=Who Framed Roger Rabbit 2 would include "digital Bob Hoskins"|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/who-framed-roger-rabbit-2/45599/who-framed-roger-rabbit-2-would-include-digital-bob-hoskins|publisher=Den of Geek|accessdate=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roger Rabbit dance===
Roger Rabbit was the inspiration for a popular dance move in America in the early 1990s, called "[[The Roger Rabbit (dance)|the Roger Rabbit]]" due to the floppy movements of the character in the film.&lt;ref&gt;For example, fitness expert [[Monica Brant]] verifies her efforts to learn the dance in the 1990s in Monica Brant, ''Monica Brant's Secrets to Staying Fit and Loving Life'' (Sports Publishing LLC, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=_-XovLHmb5EC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=%22The+Roger+Rabbit+(dance)%22&amp;ei=hTMbSYy8PIjUMpDrye8N 4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The dance is even used in the dedication of W. Michael Kelley, ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Calculus'' (Alpha Books, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=H-0L9Dxor6sC&amp;pg=PR2&amp;dq=%22The+Roger+Rabbit+(dance)%22&amp;ei=hTMbSYy8PIjUMpDrye8N ii].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book cover==
The book cover was inspired by the cover of [[The Beatles]] album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. It features rock and pop musicians [[Josipa Lisac]], [[Bebi Dol]], [[Nele Karajlić]], [[Oliver Mandić]], [[Marina Perazić]], [[Branimir Štulić]], [[Slađana Milošević]] and [[Dado Topić]], [[Đorđe Marjanović]], [[Dušan Kojić]], [[Arsen Dedić]], [[Đorđe Balašević]], [[Viktorija]], [[Kornelije Kovač]], [[Siluete|Zoran Miščević]], [[Goran Bregović]], [[Žika Jelić|Žika]] and [[Dragi Jelić]], [[Oliver Dragojević]] and [[Mišo Kovač]], [[Zdravko Čolić]] (in the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] uniform, from a photograph taken during his army service), [[Bora Đorđević]] (in a uniform similar to the ones The Beatles members are wearing on the cover of ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''), and [[Momčilo Bajagić]]. The album cover also features the [[White Angel]], [[Saint Sava]], football player [[Dragan Džajić]], bodybuilder [[Petar Čelik]] and his wife Irena (from the cover of [[Laboratorija Zvuka]] album ''Telo''), actor [[Zoran Radmilović]] (in the role of [[King Ubu]]), scientist [[Nikola Tesla]], film director [[Emir Kusturica]], basketball player [[Vlade Divac]], [[folk music|folk]] musician [[Toma Zdravković]], [[Romani people|Romani]] musician [[Šaban Bajramović]], actors [[Dragan Nikolić]] and [[Milena Dravić]] (from the time of their hit TV show ''Obraz uz obraz''), and a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of the former Yugoslav president [[Josip Broz Tito]].

==Reactions==
In his 2010 book ''Smijurijada'', former [[Azra]] frontman [[Branimir Štulić]] commented on the book:

{{cquote|''Funny thing, if you take these top ten albums of Yugoslav rock (out of one hundred of them) and apply the weighted points system that gets used for those sort of lists (ten points for the first spot, nine for the second, eight for the third, one for the tenth), turns out Azra gets the top spot (as it should, although that wasn't the intention of the people who organized the voting that was, by the way, limited to the local [[Belgrade]] cocoon), which is something that occurs to no one because, naturally, in the actual list [[Idoli]]&lt;nowiki&gt; are on top, then comes the Belgrade trio [&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Šarlo Akrobata]], [[Električni Orgazam]]&lt;nowiki&gt;, Idoli], followed by the rest of the acts, while among the one hundred albums, the most successful is &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Bijelo Dugme|Dugme]], then [[Riblja Čorba|Čorba]], then me (no, I'm not bitter). So, another proof that neither myself nor [[Nikola Tesla|Tesla]] belong to that company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=1090349 "Smijurijada: Mada sam svoju pamet mogao i na nečem značajnijem pokazati", vreme.com]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 2011 interview for ''[[Večernje novosti]]'', [[Električni Orgazam]] frontman [[Srđan Gojković|Srđan Gojković "Gile"]], commented on the fact that Električni Orgazam albums ''[[Distorzija]]'' and ''[[Kako bubanj kaže]]'' came in at No.24 and No.73, respectively:

{{cquote|''To be honest, it doesn't mean much to me because it doesn't quite match my opinion. For instance, I think Kako bubanj kaže didn't quite turn out the way it was supposed to. Although there are good songs on it that we still play, I believe it's one of the two weakest Orgazam albums. I think [[Lišće prekriva Lisabon]] deserves to be on that list much more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/spektakl.147.html:356360-Srdjan-Gojkovic-Gile-Kako-bubanj-kaze-je-los-album "Srđan Gojković Gile: Kako bubanj kaže je loš album", novosti.rs]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2013, for the book's 15th anniversary, Balkanrock.com [[webzine]] interviewed some of the musicians whose work made the list. [[Zdenko Kolar]] (who played on [[Idoli]] albums ''[[Odbrana i poslednji dani]]'' and ''[[VIS Idoli (EP)|VIS Idoli]]'', ranked No.1 and No.71 respectively, as well as on the split album ''[[Paket aranžman]]'', ranked No.2) stated:

{{cquote|''On the one hand, I was glad — it's nice when someone remembers you, when you hear that someone appreciates your work; "It was not all in vain", as they say — and on the other hand, I believe that lists and similar 'rankings' don't reflect reality. Sure, this is a collection of a great number of relevant people's opinions, but if it were another hundred people being polled, or had the poll been organized a few years earlier, the result might not have been the same. [The fact that Odbrana i poslednji dani is ranked No.1 and Paket aranžman is ranked No.2] doesn't mean much to me. It was a long time ago, after all, and life goes on, bringing new things that are more current and contemporary, which from this point of view seem more important to me and have, I think, been more fulfilling to me. [...] It's interesting that the ranking of the [Idoli] albums on this list is inversely proportional to the number of copies they sold. I really couldn't tell you if the list is fair, or whether some album is missing, or if some of those that made the list are overrated/underrated.

In the same online piece, Vedad Hadžiabdić, [[Teška Industrija]] guitarist (whose album ''Teška Industrija'' was ranked No.95), stated:

{{cquote|''In my opinion, it includes everything that was important on the Yugoslav rock scene. [...] From this point of view, I think Teška Industrija could have been ranked a bit higher.

{{cquote|''I never attached all that much importance to these types of lists because, in the end, it's just a collection of individual viewpoints. Of course, having said that, back 15 years ago when they told me I made the list, I was a bit surprised, and it wasn't like I wasn't glad. My thinking is similar today, some things have definitely been unjustly omitted, and a lot of the overrated albums have been included. Besides, you can just glance through the list and look at each album individually for a few moments, and ask yourself 'how many of these songs have successfully stood the test of time', 'how many of them are still alive today'.

'''Zapin Api''' (lit: "Zapin of Fire"; [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: زاڤين اڤي) is a [[firedance]] technique of the [[Malay people|classical Malay]] [[Zapin]] founded in [[Rupat Island|Pulau Rupat Utara]], [[Bengkalis]], [[Riau]], [[Indonesia]]. The identifying characteristic of Zapin Api is the incorporation of fire and strong focus on the [[Malay folklore|mystical elements]]. The dance form was historically dormant and extinct for nearly 40 years before its revival in 2013.&lt;ref name="Syahnan Rangkuti 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Syahnan Rangkuti|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
===The legends of Tari Api===
[[File:Rupat.png|thumb|The shores of [[Rupat Island|Pulau Rupat]] witnessed an exodus of [[Malay people|Malays]] arriving from [[Malacca]] in 1511, thus becoming the ancestors for most of the islanders today.]]
The dance traced its origin from the precursor Tari Api ritual performed by the people of Pulau Rupat. The area was settled by the [[Malay people|Malay]] refugees who fled from the turmoil in [[Malaccan Sultanate|Malacca]], after the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|fall of the kingdom]] to the [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese hands]] in 1511.&lt;ref name="M. Hapis 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|M. Hapis|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend attested that Pulau Rupat was cursed under a series of [[Natural disasters|catastrophes]] in the 1500s and a harmonious balance between all of the elements should be called for in order to restore peace in the area. This led the islanders under the leadership of Panglima Sage Dagendang, a representative from the Malaccan courts to seek the assistance from the four ''Pawang Besar'' (Great Mystique) of four natural elements: [[earth]], [[fire]], [[wind]] and [[water]]. The mystique agreed upon their request and summoned the ''[[Jinn|jins]]'' (spirits) from the each respective elements for reconciliation.&lt;ref name="Putur Fajar Arcana 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Putur Fajar Arcana|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the jins accepted the invitation to meet with the mystique, except the fire spirit. He demanded that he only would arrive in the entourage with a condition, that a special celebration would be held for him. The mystique agrees and he asked the spectators to take of their clothes and usher the arrival of the fire jin.&lt;ref name="M. Hapis 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|M. Hapis|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jin arrives and the mystique became his intermediate between the real world and the spiritual underworld. Thus, commencing the reconciliation process between the two entities. The fire spirit sets the rules and regulations for the performance, together with the condition that the elements of fire should be used in the dance and added mantra that the mortals should abide during the performance, thus signifying birth of the Tari Api.

===Zapin Api===
The arrival of the [[Arab]]-[[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] Islamic missionaries transformed the ideals of the classical Tari Api. The traditional paganistic mantras and rituals were complimented with religious prayers and worshiping. The dance emulated the fusion and the cultural accumulation between the traditional Arab ''[[Zaffa]]'' with the Zapin form of the Malays. In contrast to the predominantly [[Sufi]]-infused Arabic Zaffa, the strong element of the cultural mysticism of the Malay was present in the performance.&lt;ref name="Putur Fajar Arcana 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M. Hapis 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|M. Hapis|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dance form was widely staged by the Bengkalis Malay community, especially during the major festival and celebrations in the area including in the wedding receptions, [[circumcision]] ceremony and the ritualistic ''Safar'' Bath. However, the meteoric rise of the new form of entertainments in the area resulted the gradual death of Zapin, superseded by the modern-[[karaoke]] and [[Dangdut]] celebrations by the locals. By the 1980s, the fatal blow was hit and the Zapin Api performance was declared extinct in the area.

===Resurrection===
By 2013, by the initiative of Pak Edwar, the head of the [[Bengkalis]] Tourism Department requested Pak Abdullah, the ringmaster of the traditional Zapin Api for a revival of the traditional dance art in the area.  He enthusiastically began to recruit young men and nurture them about the Malay art form.  Thus, commencing his journey on resurrecting the once extinct zapin api. Not long after, the dance is once again staged in the island.&lt;ref name="Syahnan Rangkuti 2016"/&gt;

==Performance==
===Philosophy===
Based on the observation by Tom Ibnur, a Zapin-enthusiast, he observed that Zapin Zapi was a true fusion between the Arabic Zaffa which was orchestrated as a form of religious entertainment by the Islamic missionaries with the indigenous Malay [[firedance]]. The element of Zapin can be witnessed in the form of the rhythms and the coordinations, while the native pre-Islamic elements can clearly observed when the performers was in an unconscious hallucinations and hypnotic euphoria during the climax of the dance.&lt;ref name="Putur Fajar Arcana 2017"/&gt;

===The dance===
[[File:Zapin Api 2.jpg|thumb|A Zapin Api performer in a [[trance]], with Mr. Abdullah, the ringmaster playing the [[Gambus]], one of the main instrument accompanying the dance.]]
There are several strict rituals that must be adhered to by the ringleader, players and even the spectators. All the dancers, musicians and the instruments are required bathed upon a sacred water and smoked by mantras a few days before the performance. While during the Zapin, it is strongly prohibited for the spectators to light up any fires nor call the players name.

The performance begins when the participants reciting prayers with the burning [[incense]]. The court was then set with [[Bonfire]] made from burning [[coconut shell]], as a preparation of the dance. The leader recite his mantras and commencing the Malay orchestra in the background to summon the spirits. He intensifies his mantras as the music plays along.&lt;ref name="Wiwik Setiawati 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Wiwik Setiawati|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The players dance along with the orchestra, slowly one by one succumbed into a spellbinded position and drawn directly into the fire. They continued to dance erratically while playing with the fiery coconut shell. Some would collapse in ecstasy during the performance.&lt;ref name="Syahnan Rangkuti 2016"/&gt;

When the music is set, the stage is alight and the zapin commenced, the performers usually recalled that the staged was suddenly transformed into a beautiful [[orchard]] and they were accompanied by a [[nymph]] who had suddenly emerged and leading them to dance. The performance may last several hours long, drawing many of the performers became unconscious after induced in a [[cataleptic]] affair.&lt;ref name="Wiwik Setiawati 2016"/&gt;

The Zapin would only ends based on the discretion of the ringleader. Ironically, there was no sign of burning on the skins of the performers, despite spending hours of dwelling in the blazing fire.

===Contemporary development===
The dance slowly gained wide recognition and interest following its revival from the stage of Bengkalis since 2013. The government of [[Riau Province]] also hailed the dance as among the components of the local tourist industry, drawing local and international crowds alike to witness its mystical performance.
