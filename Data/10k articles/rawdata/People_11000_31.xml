      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="110512">The [[2009 World Series of Poker]] was the 40th annual [[World Series of Poker]] (WSOP). Held in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] at the [[Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino]], the 2009 series began on May 27 and featured 57 [[poker]] championships in [[List of poker variants|several variants]]. All events but the $10,000 World Championship No Limit [[Texas hold 'em]] Main Event, the most prestigious of the WSOP events, ended by July 15. The final table of the Main Event, known as the [[November Nine]], was suspended until November, to allow for better television coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldseriesofpoker.com/news/article.asp?newsID=1855 |title=2008 World Series of Poker Set for May 30 through July 15 in Las Vegas |publisher=WorldSeriesofPoker.com |accessdate=2008-09-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080916221056/http://www.worldseriesofpoker.com/news/article.asp?newsID=1855| archivedate= 16 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the WSOP custom since 1976, each of the event winners received a [[World Series of Poker bracelet|championship bracelet]] in addition to that event's prize money, which this year ranged from US$87,778 for the $500 Casino Employees No-Limit Hold'em  to US$8,546,435 for the Main Event.

==WSOP game variants==
Most of the tournaments played at the WSOP are variants of [[Texas Hold 'em]].  Hold 'em is a [[community card]] game where each player may use any combination of the five community cards and the player's own two [[glossary of poker terms#hole|hole cards]] to make a poker hand, in contrast to [[poker variants]] such as [[stud poker|stud]] or [[draw poker|draw]] in which each player holds a separate individual hand.  Between 2000 and 2009, hold'em surpassed [[seven-card stud]] as the most common game in U.S. casinos.&lt;ref name="15stud"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.twoplustwo.com/magazine/issue21/clark0906.html| title=The Dying Days of Las Vegas 1-5 Stud| accessdate=October 4, 2006| last=Clark | first=Bryan|date=September 2006 | work=Two Plus Two Internet Magazine | publisher=Two Plus Two Publishing | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061123021244/http://www.twoplustwo.com/magazine/issue21/clark0906.html  | archivedate = 2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seven-card stud is a poker variant wherein each player is dealt two hole cards and one face-up to start the hand, followed by three more face-up cards one at a time, and then another hidden card, with betting after each round. Another poker variant played is [[Omaha hold 'em|Omaha]], a game in which each player is dealt four hole cards and must use exactly two of them in conjunction with three community cards to make the best possible five-card hand.  Other games played at the 2008 tournament included [[Razz (poker)|Razz]], [[HORSE]], and Deuce-to-Seven.

Within each of these poker variants a myriad of options exist.  For example, depending on the betting structure, a tournament might be described as [[glossary of poker terms#no-limit|no limit]], [[glossary of poker terms#limit|limit]] or [[glossary of poker terms#pot-limit|pot-limit]]. Games may also include other variations on the rules governing the execution of the specific game such as [[glossary of poker terms#shootout|shootout]], [[Glossary of poker terms#E|eight or better]], or [[Glossary of poker terms#H|heads up.]]

==2009 highlights==
There were 57 events, two more [[2008 World Series of Poker results|than in 2008]].  The main event had 6,494 buy-ins, 350 fewer than the previous year. Other changes for 2009 include the elimination of [[Buying in (poker)|rebuy events]] and the introduction of triple starting chips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pokerworks.com/poker-news/2009/03/16/2009-wsop-rule-and-structure-changes.html Expect Rule and Structure Changes at 2009 WSOP], a March 16, 2009 article from pokerworks.com. Accessed 2009-07-29.  [https://www.webcitation.org/5jdtN0bP5?url=http://pokerworks.com/poker-news/2009/03/16/2009-wsop-rule-and-structure-changes.html Archived] 2009-09-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition that 2009 was the 40th WSOP, the tournament started with a special $40,000 No-Limit event.  As one of the most expensive poker tournaments ever, the event attracted what considered to be one of the toughest poker fields ever assembled.&lt;ref name ="top10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/7126-2009-wsop-the-10-best-performances-of-the-summer|title=2009 WSOP—The 10 Best Performances of the Summer|last=Murphy|first=Stephen|date=2009-07-03|accessdate=2009-07-08|publisher=''Cardplayer Magazine''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poker pro, [[Vitaly Lunkin]], won his second bracelet in this event.  Lunkin then finished in second place at the $10,000 pot-limit Omaha event and the $50,000 HORSE Championship, finishing the summer with over $2.7 million.&lt;ref name = "top10" /&gt;  [[David Bach (poker player)|David Bach]], a player with several final table appearances, won his first bracelet in the $50,000 HORSE Championship.  At 18 hours and 44 minutes the final table of the $50K HORSE event was the second longest final table in WSOP history.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

[[Jeff Lisandro]] became the fifth player to ever win three bracelets in the same year, and the first ever to win bracelets in all three stud variants offered at the WSOP (stud high-only, stud high-low, and Razz) in the same year. Poker superstar [[Barry Greenstein]], said that "A lot of people might have said before this year, we may not ever see another guy win three bracelets because the fields are so big... Lisandro proved them wrong."&lt;ref name = "top10" /&gt;  He was the first player to do so since Phil Ivey did it in 2002.  By winning two bracelets, Ivey, considered by many to be the best overall poker player in the world,&lt;ref name = "top10" /&gt; became the youngest player to ever amass seven WSOP bracelets. The milestone means he is tied with [[Poker Hall of Fame]]r [[Billy Baxter (poker player)|Billy Baxter]] at sixth place on the [[World Series of Poker multiple bracelet winners|most bracelets list]].

Due to capacity limitations, the 2009 WSOP turned away over 500 players from the Main Event.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  [[Patrik Antonius]], [[T. J. Cloutier]], [[Layne Flack]], [[Ted Forrest]], [[Brandon Adams (poker player)|Brandon Adams]], [[Richard Ashby]], and [[Mickey Appleman]] were among the notable players turned away from the Main Event.  [[1996 World Series of Poker|1996 WSOP]] champion [[Huck Seed]] would have been included in that list, if he had not won the [[National Heads-Up Poker Championship]] which meant he was guaranteed entry into the 2009 WSOP Main Event.&lt;ref name = "soldout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/7145-hundreds-turned-away-from-the-wsop-main-event|title=Hundreds Turned Away from the WSOP Main Event| last=Murphy| first=Stephen| date=2009-07-06| accessdate=2009-07-08| publisher=''Cardplayer Magazine''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tournament which met its capacity limits was the "$1,000 buy-in Stimulus Special." This event set a new record for a non-main event tournament with 6,012 participants.&lt;ref name="early records"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokernewsdaily.com/wsop-1000-stimulus-special-tournament-sold-out-2670/ |title=WSOP $1,000 Stimulus Special Tournament Sold Out |last=Jenkins |first=Tom |date=2009-05-30 |accessdate=2009-05-31 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jdtKzGbd?url=http://www.pokernewsdaily.com/wsop-1000-stimulus-special-tournament-sold-out-2670/ |archivedate=2009-09-08 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PocketFives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketfives.com/online-poker-scene/numerous-records-shattered-at-2009-wsop-4324639 |title=Numerous Records Shattered at 2009 WSOP |work=PocketFives |publisher=PocketFives |date=2009-05-31 |accessdate=2009-05-31 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jdtKB6Mp?url=http://www.pocketfives.com/online-poker-scene/numerous-records-shattered-at-2009-wsop-4324639 |archivedate=2009-09-08 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{note label|Event 2|a|a}}The $7.7 million prize pool was the largest non-main event prize pool in WSOP history.&lt;ref name = "early records" /&gt;

{{note label|Event 3|b|b}}The 918 players set a record turnout for an Omaha event at the WSOP.&lt;ref name = "early records" /&gt;

{{note label|Event 4|c|c}}Event 5 was originally scheduled to end on June 2, but because of the size of the field the tournament was extended a day.

{{note label|Event 4|d|d}}Event 4 had the lowest buy-in of all the open events since the 2006 WSOP.  Dubbed the "$1,000 buy-in Stimulus Special," it set a new record for a non-main event tournament with 6,012 participants.  This number would have been larger, but the tournament was capped at 6,012 players.&lt;ref name="early records"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PocketFives"/&gt;

{{note label|Event 52|e|e}}Like all the Pot Limit Omaha events, event 52 was a "Triple Chance" event.  In these events players had access to three equal units of chips.  For example, in a $2500 event, players have access to a total of 7500 in chips, but they had to option to start with either 2500, 5000 or all 7500.  If they started with 2500, and lost those chips, they could access another 2500 or their remaining 5000.  They were not eliminated until they had lost all 7500 of their possible starting chips.  Thus the event was not a [[Glossary of poker terms#rebuy|rebuy event]](There were no rebuy events in 2009 WSOP.), but rather one where players could lose all their chips during the first three rounds but not be eliminated until they lost all 7500 chips.  If a player started with less than the full 7500, at the end of three rounds any remaining available 2500 units were added to the player's stacks, and anyone losing all their chips after that point would be eliminated.

{{note label|Event 52|f|f}}The final table of the Main Event is now known as the [[November Nine]] as the nine players have to wait until November to determine who the champion is.

Sir '''Alexander Seton''', also known as '''Alexander de Seton''' ([[fl.]] 1311–c1348) was the Governor (sometimes referred to as the Keeper or the Captain) of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]].

==Life==
Alexander Seton took part in [[Edward Bruce]]'s 1315 campaign in Ireland.&lt;ref name=Bruce&gt;[https://archive.org/details/houseofsetonstv100seto Seton, Bruce Gordon. ''The House of Seton'', Vol. I, Lindsay and MacLeod, Edinburgh, 1939]&lt;/ref&gt; He signed the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] of 1320 asserting the independence of Scotland.

==Berwick-upon-Tweed==
{{Campaignbox Second War of Scottish Independence}}
In 1327 he was said to be appointed keeper of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]]. For how long is unclear as on March 21 King Robert applied for a Safe-Conduct for him to go to England for negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, William, ''The Scottish Nation'', Edinburgh, 1861, vol.8, p.436.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1331 Sir Robert de Lawedre of The Bass was Keeper of the Scottish Marches and Custodian of the Castle of Berwick-upon-Tweed, receiving a fee attributed to those positions, at Pentecost, of £33.6s.8p. He is also described as Sheriff of Berwick, for which he received a further payment. &lt;ref&gt;''Exchequer Rolls of Scotland'', vol.1, 1264-1359, Edinburgh, 1878, pps: 279,313,339 &amp; 399.&lt;/ref&gt; He was still holding those positions the following year as mentioned by the historian of the town.&lt;ref&gt;''Berwick-upon-Tweed, the History of the Town and Guild'', by John Scott, London, 1888, pps.248-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1333 [[Edward Balliol]], son and heir of King John Balliol, and Henry Beaumont, 4th Earl of Buchan, along with their supporters and those of the late [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]] invaded Scotland with the tacit support of [[Edward III of England]]. The army advanced quickly towards Berwick, which [[Capture of Berwick (1333)|was placed under siege]].

In 1333 Alexander Seton was again governor of the town of Berwick&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 1861, p.436.&lt;/ref&gt;, while [[Patrick V, Earl of March|Patrick de Dunbar, Earl of March]] was entrusted with the defence of the castle. After a long siege, an agreement to surrender Berwick within a certain time unless it has been relieved was obtained. Alexander's son, Thomas Seton, was given as a hostage.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 1861, p.436.&lt;/ref&gt;

A small party of Scots led by Sir William Keith managed with some difficulty to make their way across the charred ruins of the old bridge to the northern bank of the Tweed and were able to force their way through to the walled town, which sat below the castle. Guardian of the Realm [[Archibald Douglas (died 1333)|Archibald Douglas]], who had crossed the Border into England in order to draw Edward, viewed this as a technical relief and sent messages to Edward calling on him to depart.

King [[Edward III of England]] viewed it differently, and as the town had not surrendered by the agreed date, saw this as a breach of the agreement and hanged Thomas Seton within sight of the besieged and his parents. Another treaty was agreed to so as to protect the other hostages. Berwick was eventually surrendered after the defeat of the Scots at the [[Battle of Halidon Hill]] on 19 July 1333. In this month, in a double tragedy, Seton's son William drowned in an attack upon the English fleet at Berwick, again in sight of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 1861, p.436.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was present in [[Edward Balliol]]'s parliament on 10 February 1334 and witnessed the (temporary) cession of Berwick to the English. He had a Safe-conduct to go to England, 15 October 1337, and in August 1340 he was one of the hostages for John, Earl of Moray.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 1861, p.436.&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem]], after 1341 and was styled [[Torphichen Preceptory|Master of Torphichen]] in 1345 after being appointed to the charge of the Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem House of Torphichen by the [[Hélion de Villeneuve]], Grand Master at Rhodes. Alexander obtained an temporary dispensation granted on 6 February 1346-47 by [[Pope Clement VI]], permitting Alexander to choose a confessor. As a Knight of the Order he was granted safe-conduct dated 12 August 1348 to enable him to visit King [[David II of Scotland]], who was imprisoned within the [[Tower of London]]. Alexander seems to have died shortly afterwards.

==Marriage and issue==
He married Christian, daughter of [[Francis le Chen|Francis le Cheyne of Straloch]]; they had issue:
* Thomas, executed outside Berwick in 1333 during the siege.
* William, drowned July 1333 in an attack upon the English fleet at Berwick, during the siege.
* Margaret, the heiress, married [[Alan de Wyntoun]], and had issue. Their children took the surname of Seton.
* [[Alexander Seton (d. 1332)|Alexander]], killed opposing the landing of [[Edward Balliol]] at Kinghorn, 6 August 1332.&lt;ref name=Bruce/&gt;
* [[John Seton, 1st Baron Parbroath|John of Parbroath]], died c. 1327.

'''Angie Sanselmente Valencia''' also known as '''Angie Sanclemente Valencia''' (born 25 May 1979)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interpol.int/public/Data/Wanted/Notices/Data/2010/38/2010_10938.asp Interpol Wanted Notice for Angie Sanclemente Valencia]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former [[Colombia]]n beauty queen and lingerie model believed to be the ringleader of one of the world's largest drug syndicates.

==Background==
Valencia is originally from Colombia. where she won the Reinado Nacional del Café, a national qualifying competition for the prestigious [[Reinado Internacional del Café]] (International Queen of Coffee) beauty pageant, in 2000 but was dethroned two days later when it was found she was married. The title was awarded to Ximena Andrea García Buitrago.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/03/24/colombia.drug.queen/index.html?hpt=C1|title=Model, allegedly drug queen, on the lam|publisher=CNN|author= Karl Penhaul|date=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Zamora | first =Héctor Fabio | title =Destronada la Reina Nacional del Café | work =Archives | publisher =El Tiempo | date =2000-07-06 | url =http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-1220246 | accessdate =2011-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syndicate==
Valencia's operation is believed to be a "rival empire" to that of her former boyfriend, a Mexican drug baron known as "The Monster".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/argentina/7304510/Lingerie-model-runs-one-of-worlds-largest-drug-gangs-according-to-police.html Telegraph.co.uk: Lingerie model runs one of world's largest drug gangs, according to police]&lt;/ref&gt; She formed her own cartel after splitting with him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/world/1016790/police-hunt-ex-model-turned-cocaine-kingpin NineMSN: Police hunt ex-model turned 'cocaine kingpin'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227091035/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/world/1016790/police-hunt-ex-model-turned-cocaine-kingpin |date=February 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is alleged to have recruited other models, whom she is quoted referring to as her "unsuspicious, beautiful angels" as drug traffickers, paying them up to around $5,000 (£3,200) per trip to transport [[cocaine]] from Argentina to England by way of [[Cancún]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/02/lingerie-model-sought-for-allegedly-hiring-beautiful-models-to-smuggle-cocaine/1 USAToday: Lingerie model allegedly hired beautiful models to smuggle cocaine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Valencia's alleged syndicate was believed to have been exposed on 13 December 2009, when a 21-year-old woman, "Ariel L", was arrested with a suitcase containing 55&amp;nbsp;kg (121 pounds) of cocaine at [[Ezeiza International Airport]], Buenos Aires, Argentina.  "L" made no attempt to hide the drugs inside her bags, leading authorities to suspect the ring had help from employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/02/24/2010-02-24_lingerie_model_angie_valencia_running_global_cocaine_ring__using_fellow_catwalke.html NY Daily News: Lingerie model Angie Valencia running global cocaine ring -- using fellow catwalkers as mules: cops]&lt;/ref&gt;  She is reported to have been told that no one at the airport would try to stop her, and an investigation was launched to find employees of the airport with possible links to the syndicate.  After questioning "L", three additional arrests were made and a warrant was issued for Valencia's arrest.  Authorities believed she was still in Argentina after she fled a hotel where she had been staying with her [[Pomeranian (dog)|pomeranian]]. Investigators attempted to trace her location through the address under which the animal was registered, but it only led them to an abandoned warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1253347/Runaway-lingerie-model-Angie-Sanselmente-Valencia-named-head-drug-gang.html DailyMail.co.uk: On the run, the lingerie model who heads an all-women cocaine-smuggling cartel]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 [[Interpol]] issued an international warrant for her arrest.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

Valencia was finally arrested in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on May 26, 2010, while staying in a local [[hostel]]. Police reported that she had registered under a false name and had tried to alter her appearance by dyeing her hair blonde.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/05/26/argentina.model.arrested/?hpt=T2 CNN: Former model arrested in Argentina on drug charges]&lt;/ref&gt;

She was initially jailed on 27 May 2010 in the "Centro Federal de Detención de Mujeres Unidad número 31" in the city of Ezeiza, Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. In October of the same year she was moved to the "Instituto Correccional de Mujeres Unidad número 3" also in Ezeiza after she suffered some violent attacks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=543682&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hurley | first =Bevan | title ='Cocaine queen' moved after assaults in prison | work =New Zealand Herald | publisher =APN Holdings NZ | date =1 May 2011 | url =http://www.nzherald.co.nz/bevan-hurley/news/article.cfm?a_id=645&amp;objectid=10722644 | accessdate =19 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was released from prison and deported back to Colombia on 27 September 2013&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/argentina-frees-deports-colombia-narco-model InsightCrime.org: Argentina Frees, Deports Colombia 'Narco Model']&lt;/ref&gt; after serving only half of her original 6 year and 8-month prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/narcotrafico/Confirman-anos-prision-Angie-Sanclemente_0_827317508.html Clarin.com: Confirman la pena de casi 7 años de prisión para Angie Sanclemente]&lt;/ref&gt; She is banned from returning to Argentina.

== Production ==
Anselme produces [[Jacques Selosse]] champagne, named after his father. He took over the family vineyard in 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodandwine.com/articles/champagnes-pop-stars|title=Champagne's Pop Stars|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; after attending enology school in [[Burgundy]] and working alongside the legendary vignerons at [[Domaine Coche-Dury]], [[Domaine Leflaive]], and Domaine des Comtes Lafon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rarewineco.com/producer/selosse-champagne/|title=Selosse Champagne - Rare Wine Co.|website=www.rarewineco.com|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=But First, Champagne|last=White|first=David|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-1-5107-1144-0|location=New York, NY, USA|pages=251|language=English|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, the Selosse fields numbered 37 acres, in 42 different parcels, almost all [[chardonnay]] with some [[pinot noir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com//2006/06/15/tiny-bubble-makers/|title=Tiny Bubble-Makers|last=Asimov|first=Eric|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His particular type of wine is known as [[Grower Champagne]], where grapes used to produce the wines are grown in vineyards owned by the Selosse family, rather than being purchased from other growers. He was one of the first winemakers to show that small producers can make their own wine.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Anselme is considered a pioneer of biodynamics in Champagne and grows his grapes in an organic way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Selosse wines are fermented in [[Oak (wine)|oak barrels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/26/food/fo-wine26|title=The Questing Knight of New Age Champagne|last=SMITH|first=ROD|date=2001-12-26|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the majority of Champagne producers who often use stainless steel tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1039119215825133713|title=Something New Is Bubbling In the Champagne Region|last=Journal|first=William Echikson Special to The Wall Street|date=2002-12-06|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the wines are often described as [[Artisan|artisnal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/wine/article/Champagne-s-solo-act-Single-vineyard-bottlings-3210472.php|title=Champagne's solo act: Single-vineyard bottlings allow France's revered houses to buck tradition|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[Gault Millau|Gault-Millau]] guide named him France’s best winemaker in every category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.departures.com/shopping/worldly-goods/frances-distinctive-affordable-champagne|title=France's Distinctive, Affordable Champagne|website=Departures|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antonio Galloni''' is an [[United States of America|American]] [[wine]] [[critic]] and founder and CEO of Vinous, one of the world's most influential wine publications, for which he is also the lead critic covering the wines of Bordeaux, California, Italy, and Champagne. From 2006 to 2013 Galloni was a  [[wine tasting|tasting]] staff member of [[Robert M. Parker, Jr.|Robert Parker]]'s publication ''[[The Wine Advocate]]''. In May 2013, Galloni founded [[Vinous Media|Vinous]] (http://vinousmedia.com).&lt;ref name=sf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Official Vinous website (May 20, 2013).

== Biography ==
Galloni was born in Caracas, Venezuela to an Italian father and American mother. When he was 11 the family moved to Sarasota, Florida where his parents retailed Italian wines. This early exposure to wine began a lifelong fascination with wine. Galloni’s maternal grandmother introduced him to the wines of Burgundy, while his father instilled in him that “there are two great wines in the world: Barolo and Champage”.

Galloni received a degree from Boston’s Berklee College of Music in jazz composition and guitar. After a stint as a musician and waiter, which led him to get to know many of the new California wineries of the time, he took a job with Putnam Investments and was soon after sent to Putnam’s Milan office. This opportunity was a total immersion in Italian wine and culture. Galloni returned to the U.S. to acquire a formal business education.

==Career==
In 2004, while studying for an MBA at MIT's Sloan School of Management, Galloni began publication of the ''Piedmont Report'' newsletter profiling the wine of [[Piemonte wine|Piedmont]]. At the time the only critic who had been writing about the wines of Italy in English was James Suckling. Within weeks ''Piedmont Report'' had subscribers in more than 25 countries and quickly established itself as the premier guide in the world for Piedmont wines. Galloni turned down an offer to write for Robert Parker’s ''The Wine Advocate'' to work for a brief stint at Deutsche Bank in New York City. In 2006, he accepted Parker’s offer to join ''The Wine Advocate'' as a reviewer of [[Italian wine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Goldberg |first= Howard G., ''Decanter.com'' |title= Parker announces new staff |url= http://www.decanter.com/news/wine-news/487005/parker-announces-new-staff |date=September 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a contributor to Parker's ''Wine Buyer’s Guide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Comiskey |first= Patrick, ''Los Angeles Times'' |title=Robert Parker shares his soapbox World of wine scores |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/15/food/fo-parker15 |date= October 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, as Parker restructured the coverage of his staff of reviewers and announced he would no longer review [[California wine]], Galloni's area of coverage was expanded to include California, [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]], [[Chablis wine|Chablis]] and the [[Côte d'Or (escarpment)|Côte d'Or]].&lt;ref name=sf&gt;Bonné, Jon, ''San Francisco Chronicle'' (February 7, 2011).

[http://www.vinography.com/archives/2011/02/the_end_of_an_era_robert_parke.html The End of an Era: Robert Parker Stops Reviewing California Wine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Galloni has stated in ''The Wine Advocate'' issue 186 that he will only review Champagne that provides a [[Disgorging|disgorgement]] date so he may accurately rate a Champagne by its release.&lt;ref name=sf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colman, Tyler, drvino.com (December 29, 2009). [http://www.drvino.com/2009/12/29/champange-champagne-values-bargains-bordeaux/ SIPPED: upgrading label info?]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Antonio left the ''TWA ''to start ''Vinous''. At the time of his departure, Galloni was the lead critic at ''The Wine Advocate'', and had authored 1/3rd of the reviews published by ''TWA'' in 2012. Galloni also ran the world’s most followed bulletin board on Italian wines and spearheaded ''TWA''’s production of video content. He developed tailored public events &amp; seminars such as the highly anticipated “La Festa del Barolo,” vertical tastings focused on the benchmark wines of Italy, and numerous charity dinners.

==Vinous launch==
In February 2013, following the announcement by Parker that he was stepping down as editor-in-chief of ''The Wine Advocate'' and had sold a controlling stake to a Singapore investor, Galloni announced himself that he would leave the publication and establish his own internet publication,&lt;ref name="nyt13"&gt;Asimov, Eric, ''The New York Times'' (February 12, 2013).[http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/a-new-web-venture-for-antonio-galloni/ A New Web Venture for Antonio Galloni]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barmann, Jay, ''GrubStreet.com'' (February 12, 2013).

Aimed towards a broader demographic of wine consumers, Galloni has stated he would continue to report on the wines of Italy, Champagne, California and Burgundy and will cover wines from [[Bordeaux]] from the 2013 vintage, as well as craft spirits.&lt;ref name="deca-ag" /&gt;

Vinous has since acquired Stephen Tanzer’s ''International Wine Cellar'' and the apps Delectable and Banquet.

==Lawsuit==

In March 2013, it was reported that ''The Wine Advocate'' had filed a [[United States federal courts|federal]] [[lawsuit]] against Galloni five weeks after his departure for breach of contract, fraud and defamation.&lt;ref name="sf-sue"&gt;Bonné, Jon, ''San Francisco Chronicle'' (March 20, 2013).

[http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/robert-parker-vs-antonio-galloni/ Robert Parker vs. Antonio Galloni]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The lawsuit, filed in [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] in Maryland, advancing the complaint, was never served.&lt;ref name="shk-sue"&gt;''Shanken News Daily'' (March 21, 2013). [http://www.shankennewsdaily.com/index.php/2013/03/21/5406/parkers-advocate-suing-former-contributor-galloni-in-federal-court/ Parker’s Advocate Suing Former Contributor Galloni In Federal Court]&lt;/ref&gt;
All the articles cited in the case have subsequently appeared on Galloni's [[Vinous Media]] website.&lt;ref&gt;Official Vinous website. [http://vinousmedia.com/articles Articles]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Parker, ''The Wine Advocate’s'' efforts were “simply a matter of retrieving a service we paid for,” rather than “an attempt to stop Antonio from moving on; we continue to wish him our very best.”

'''Arthur Jay Finkelstein''' (May 18, 1945 – August 18, 2017) was a [[New York (state)|New York State]]-based [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (GOP) consultant who had worked for [[American conservatism|conservative]] and right-wing candidates in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Israel]], [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] over the past four decades.

With his brother, Ronald, he ran a political consulting and survey-research firm based in [[Irvington, New York]]. Finkelstein's specialties were polling, strategy, message, media, ad placement, and advising on general campaign management. In 2013, he was honored by the [[American Association of Political Consultants]], and named to its Hall of Fame, "the highest honor that the working members of the profession can bestow upon a colleague."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theaapc.org/awards/hall-of-fame|title=Hall of Fame|website=theaapc.org|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth and education==
Finkelstein grew up in a lower-middle-class [[American Jews|Jewish]] family, living in [[Brooklyn]]'s East New York section until age 11, then in [[Levittown, New York]], and later [[Queens]]. He and his two brothers attended local public schools; Finkelstein graduated from Forest Hills High School. Their parents were immigrants from Eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="samroberts"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/19/us/politics/arthur-finkelstein-innovative-influential-conservative-strategist-dies-at-72.html|title=Arthur Finkelstein, Innovative, Influential Conservative Strategist, Dies at 72|first=Sam|last=Roberts|date=August 19, 2017|accessdate=August 26, 2017|website=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com&amp;gwh=089C9969ED118EFCCA3706372C68E4B0&amp;gwt=pay]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909232900/http://www.google.com/ |date=September 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the father worked as a cabdriver&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/05/nyregion/1992-elections-new-york-state-behind-victory-d-amato-strategist-shuns-spotlight.html?scp=1&amp;sq=%22Arthur+J.+Finkelstein%22+d%27amato&amp;st=nyt|title=BEHIND THE VICTORY; D'Amato Strategist Shuns the Spotlight|last=Janofsky|first=Michael|date=November 5, 1992|work=The |accessdate=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did various jobs in the garment trade. While a student at [[Columbia University]], Finkelstein interviewed and helped produce radio programs for author/philosopher [[Ayn Rand]],&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~maw/Link%20Paper.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015155426/http://www.princeton.edu/~maw/Link%20Paper.pdf |archivedate=October 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a volunteer at the New York headquarters of the [[Draft Goldwater Committee]] in 1963–64 (the famous "Suite 3505").&lt;ref name="samroberts"/&gt; He eventually earned a bachelor's degree from [[Queens College]] in 1967 in economics and political science.&lt;ref name="samroberts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;Schudel, Matt, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/arthur-finkelstein-shadowy-campaign-mastermind-and-gop-operative-dies-at-72/2017/08/19/0bd638c6-84e8-11e7-902a-2a9f2d808496_story.html "Arthur Finkelstein, quietly influential GOP campaign mastermind, dies at 72"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career (Buckley, Nixon, Helms, Reagan), 1968–76==
In 1968, Finkelstein did behind-the-scenes election analysis for [[NBC News]], part of the network's team working under former Census director [[Richard M. Scammon]] and exit-polling pioneer Irwin A. "Bud" Lewis.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

In 1969–70, he worked as a computer programmer in the Data Processing department of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] at its offices on 11 Wall Street in lower Manhattan. He was a familiar face in Greenwich Village, where he often argued politics from a street-corner soapbox.&lt;ref name="samroberts"/&gt; In his spare time, he aided State Senator [[John Marchi]] in his unsuccessful Republican-Conservative campaign for Mayor of New York City in 1969.&lt;ref name="Lynn, Frank 1979"&gt;Lynn, Frank, "A Political Pollster for Conservatives", ''The New York Times'', December 16, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[F. Clifton White]], mastermind of the [[Draft Goldwater Committee]], was Finkelstein's political patron and consulting partner in the early 1970s in the firm, DirAction Services. The young pollster's first electoral success came at age 25 in 1970, with the independent Conservative campaign of [[James L. Buckley]] for senator from New York. This was one of several New York statewide contests where he was able to maneuver his clients to victory in three-way scenarios. Buckley won a plurality upset victory over GOP incumbent [[Charles Goodell]] and favored Democrat [[Richard Ottinger]]. Of that election night, Buckley later wrote, "By 10 pm, ... Finkelstein (my volunteer analyst who called the final results within one-tenth of one percent based on a Sunday-night telephone survey) assured me that I had won."&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, James L., ''If Men Were Angels: A View From the Senate'' (New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1976), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein encapsulated Buckley's message in the catchphrase, "Isn't it about time we had a Senator?"&lt;ref name="samroberts"/&gt;

Finkelstein's work in New York led to his serving in 1971-72 as one of several pollsters for President [[Richard M. Nixon]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1972|re-election campaign]] developing sophisticated [[demographics|demographic]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Evidence of Finkelstein's polling work for Nixon is cited in ''Catholic Historical Review'', Jan 2012 issue, Vol 98, No. 1, "CATHOLIC CACOPHONY: Richard Nixon, The Church and Welfare Reform", specifically "Letter from Arthur Finkelstein to Robert Marik, December 16, 1971, attached to Memorandum from Roy Morey to John Ehrlichman, September 24, 1971, White House Central Files, Subject File - Religious Matters, Box 18, Folder: RM 3-1 Catholic 1/1/71-12/72, RMNPP"&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1972 election also saw the first of his three victorious campaigns to elect [[Jesse Helms]] as U.S. senator from North Carolina.&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130208131845/http://www.newsweek.com/id/102818/page/2]&lt;/ref&gt; After the election, Finkelstein worked with Helms political aides [[Thomas F. Ellis|Tom Ellis]] and [[Carter Wrenn]] to establish a permanent conservative organization, the [[National Congressional Club]],&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Paul, ''The Washington Post'',  October 15, 1982, "Helms Modernizes GOP Political Machine for the Electronic Age"&lt;/ref&gt; which lasted until 1995.&lt;ref name="Christensen, Rob 2017"&gt;Christensen, Rob, ''Raleigh News &amp; Observer'', September 8, 2017,  "He was the man behind the curtain in NC politics"&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein and White went their separate ways in the mid-1970s,&lt;ref name="Lynn, Frank 1979"/&gt; and he founded his own firm, Arthur J. Finkelstein &amp; Associates (often later shortened to AJF &amp; Associates).&lt;ref name="samroberts"/&gt; In the 1976 presidential primaries, White supported [[Gerald Ford]],&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', January 11, 1993, "OBIT: F. Clifton White; Architect of '64 Goldwater Campaign"&lt;/ref&gt; while Finkelstein worked for [[Ronald Reagan]]'s insurgent campaign.

He helped Helms's Congressional Club turn around the faltering Reagan effort with a victory in the April North Carolina primary.&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"/&gt; His work continued in the subsequent Texas primary. "Finkelstein had been a key figure in 1976, when he helped orchestrate Reagan's campaign-saving comeback in North Carolina" which was crucial in Reagan's further political advancement.&lt;ref name="North Carolina 1976"&gt;{{cite book|title=Reagan's Revolution: The Untold Story of the Campaign That Started It All|last=Shirley|first= Craig|authorlink= Craig Shirley|year=2005|publisher=Nelson Current|location= Nashville, Tennessee|isbn= 0-7852-6049-8|page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Finkelstein's urging, Reagan made a major issue of the impending [[Panama Canal Treaties]], which [[Gerald Ford]] was negotiating and which infuriated conservative voters. (This proved to be Reagan's signature issue throughout the late 1970s.) As [[Jules Witcover]] later reported, "Tens of thousands of [[George Wallace|Wallace]] voters were gradually cut adrift during his slide [in the primaries] ... and Reagan media man Arthur Finkelstein recruited a Wallaceite from Fort Worth to radio and television spots for Reagan ... It was dynamite."&lt;ref&gt;Witcover, Jules, ''Marathon'' (New York: Viking Press, 1977), p. 419&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]]'s Mike Robinson wrote Finkelstein was "viewed by many as instrumental in Gov. Reagan's 1976 primary successes in North Carolina and Texas."&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Mike, Washington Dateline, [[Associated Press]], May 5, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

==NCPAC, a GOP Senate majority, and Reagan's victory, 1975–80==
Passage of the post-Watergate [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] (FECA) amendments, and the subsequent 1976 Supreme Court decision in [[Buckley v. Valeo]], drastically altered the rules by which Presidential and Congressional contests were waged. Finkelstein was among the first to sense an opportunity, and pioneered the concept and execution of [[independent expenditure]] campaigns, which would operate as a third force in an election beyond the control of candidate or party officials.&lt;ref name="samroberts"/&gt;

Beginning in 1975, Finkelstein was the chief strategist behind the most successful IE operation of this period, the [[National Conservative Political Action Committee]] (NCPAC).&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, Ward, ''The Washington Post'',  October 8, 1982, "Is Politics Threatening to Become Poll-itics?; The Electorate and the Art of Pulse-Taking"&lt;/ref&gt; Its Executive Director was Finkelstein protégé [[Terry Dolan (activist)|Terry Dolan]]. In 1981 New Right activist [[Richard Viguerie]] wrote, "NCPAC relies heavily on research and polling, a reflection of one of its founders, conservative pollster Arthur Finkelstein."&lt;ref&gt;Viguerie, Richard, ''The New Right: We're Ready to Lead'' (Falls Church, Va.: Viguerie Co., rev. ed. 1981), p. 57; and Edwards, Lee, ''The Conservative Revolution'', (New York: Free Press, 1999), p. 186&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, NCPAC was instrumental in the defeat of Democrats [[Dick Clark (senator)|Dick Clark]] in Iowa and [[Thomas J. McIntyre]] in New Hampshire. Both liberal senators were replaced by committed conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Post'', December 13, 1982, "Latest Mixers Of Politics, Religion Scrutinized"&lt;/ref&gt; NCPAC ran hard-hitting ads for television, radio and newspapers, crafted by Finkelstein. A central idea behind the strategy was to expose the liberal words and actions in Washington of elected officials, usually senators, whose moderate or conservative public image at home was at odds with their actual voting record.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Lawrence, ''Toronto Globe and Mail'', December 28, 1978, "U.S. veers toward New Right on anti-Government wave"&lt;/ref&gt;

NCPAC hit its peak in 1980, operating IEs in six states, its ads and organizing efforts helping to topple liberal Democrats in Iowa ([[John Culver]]), Indiana ([[Birch Bayh]]), Idaho ([[Frank Church]]) and South Dakota ([[George McGovern]]).&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Tena, Associated Press, October 3, 1980, "National Conservative Group Drops out of Anti-McGovern Campaign"&lt;/ref&gt; Less well-known were NCPAC's TV ads in the presidential contest, both negative (one featuring [[Jimmy Carter]] in a 1976 debate, another with [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] shouting "And no more Jimmy Carter!") and positive (footage of [[Ronald Reagan]] speaking on values); Finkelstein concentrated these ad buys in closely contested Southern states (e.g., Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama), all of which switched from Carter to Reagan in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Herbert, ''Financing the 1980 Election'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein believed in the usefulness of third forces to help conservatives win elections, but not a conservative third party (a much-discussed option in the mid-1970s). At a February 1977 conference, he told activists, "The development of a third party may very well hurt conservative options in the future by diluting them," warning that traditional and emotional ties to party labels would keep many conservatives in their present parties.&lt;ref&gt;Don McLeod, Associated Press, February 4, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; He said the Watergate scandal had cost the GOP the one clear advantage it had over the Democrats - the perception by voters that it was the more honest of the two parties. Nevertheless, he counseled against third-party option, saying this would succeed only in drawing conservatives out of both parties, creating a weak satellite party and leaving the major parties more liberal.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, Lou,  "Conservatives Are Cool To Forming Third Party", ''The Washington Post'', February 5, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides NCPAC, Finkelstein found particular success during this period in guiding individual Senate and House campaigns. Reagan backer and political unknown [[Orrin Hatch]] won a resounding 56% victory in Utah in 1976 against a three-term Democratic incumbent. In 1978, he was consultant to the successful re-election campaigns of [[Jesse Helms]] in North Carolina and [[Strom Thurmond]] in South Carolina&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Post'',  May 29, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; — the latter being Thurmond's last seriously contested race (he served until 2002, age 100). That same year, Finkelstein shepherded [[Carroll Campbell]] to his first win in South Carolina's Greenville-area 4th Congressional District.&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gailey, Phil, ''The New York Times'', September 24, 1986, "Bigotry Issue in Carolina Campaign"&lt;/ref&gt;

After a brief interlude early in 1979 as adviser to conservative Congressman [[Phil Crane]],&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Mike, Associated Press March 6, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein returned as one of the pollsters advising [[Ronald Reagan]]'s primary campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Frank, ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 16, 1979, Sec. 22, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; His services were also reportedly sought by the [[George H.W. Bush]] campaign.&lt;ref name="Lynn, Frank 1979"/&gt;

In 1980, he engineered&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Robin, ''The New York Times'', August 23, 1980, "A Persistent D'Amato Focuses on Javits's Record and Health"&lt;/ref&gt; the improbable Senate victory of Long Island supervisor [[Alfonse D'Amato]] over incumbent [[Jacob Javits]], another three-way contest where the Democrat (Congresswoman [[Liz Holtzman]]) was favored.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; He advised the successful campaign of 31-year-old State Senator [[Don Nickles]] for U.S. Senate from Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1997/08/28/1997-08-28_sen__fires_gay_pollster.html|location=New York|work=Daily News|title=Sen. Fires Gay Pollster|date=August 28, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most unlikely was the victory (aided by [[National Congressional Club]] allies) of [[John Porter East|John East]] in the North Carolina Senate contest;&lt;ref name="Allen, Kenneth S. 1988"&gt;Allen, Kenneth S., ''St. Petersburg Times'', April 11, 1988, "''Attack politics' specialist to lead Mack campaign"&lt;/ref&gt; East was a little-known professor who used a wheelchair, recruited for the race by [[Jesse Helms]] and elected through the efforts of Ellis, Wrenn, Finkelstein and the Helms organization.&lt;ref name="Christensen, Rob 2017"/&gt;

Besides Campbell, House winners included [[Duncan Hunter]] in California and [[Denny Smith]] in Oregon (both 1980), the latter toppling House [[Ways and Means Committee]] chair [[Al Ullman]]. Finkelstein also had his share of Senate losses, including two by previous client [[James L. Buckley|James Buckley]] (1976, New York,&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', October 18, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; and 1980, Connecticut),&lt;ref&gt;Madden, Richard L., ''The New York Times'', December 21, 1980, "It Costs More to Win Votes"&lt;/ref&gt; and with Avi Nelson (1978, Massachusetts). Finkelstein was also pollster-strategist for Maryland Congressman [[Robert Bauman]], who narrowly lost his seat after he was charged in DC with homosexual solicitation, one month before the November election.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein, John,  "Bauman: 'I'll Carry This to My Grave'", ''The Washington Post'', August 15, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1980s==
During the 1980 campaign Finkelstein was a Reagan pollster and had been "aboard the Reagan campaign" since mid-1979.&lt;ref name="Reagan on Carter in Baltimore 478"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rendezvous with Destiny: Ronald Reagan and the Campaign That Changed America|last=Shirley|first=Craig|authorlink= Craig Shirley|year=2009|publisher=ISI Books|location=Wilmington, Delaware|isbn=978-1-933859-55-2|page=478}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the early primary days all the way through November. Having ridden (and driven) the Republican wave of 1977–80, he found the 1980s a period of consolidation, helping clients grow their base and win re-election.

In 1981, Finkelstein was one of four pollsters designated to do work on behalf of the Reagan White House, paid by the [[Republican National Committee]]. (The others were [[Richard Wirthlin]], [[Robert Teeter]] and Tully Plesser).&lt;ref&gt;Cattani, Richard, Reagan will keep close tabs on public image, ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', January 13, 1981, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newsweek]] reported in 1982 that "each of the President's top three advisers has his own numbers man: "Wirthlin became [[Edwin Meese]]'s pollster, Teeter became [[James Baker]]'s and now Finkelstein has become [[Michael Deaver]]'s."&lt;ref&gt;Gelman, Eric, A Third Pollster for the White House, ''[[Newsweek]]'', July 5, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout Reagan's first term and into the 1984 re-election campaign, Finkelstein advised Deaver, conducting polls and planning events and visuals (e.g. Reagan's trip to France for the 40th anniversary of [[D-Day]]). As ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported: "For the White House, Finkelstein is more of an idea man than a pollster, specializing in media events such as the president's "spontaneous" drop-ins on disadvantaged individuals and institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, Lou, "Public's Personality Seems Split in Its Perception of Reagan", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', July 12, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also began dabbling in gubernatorial contests—in New Jersey (1981), for [[Jim Wallwork]] (defeated by [[Thomas Kean|Tom Kean]] in the GOP primary);&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Maurice, "Wallwork Seeks to Ride Conservative Tide in New Jersey", ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 5, 1981, p. B2&lt;/ref&gt; and in New York (1982), for [[Paul J. Curran|Paul Curran]] (defeated by [[Lewis Lehrman]] for the nomination).&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Frank, "Curran Trails Lehrman at Start of GOP Race", ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 19, 1982, pp. 2–28&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Finkelstein client [[Orrin Hatch]] sailed to re-election in Utah, while in Florida, banker [[Connie Mack III]] won his first campaign for the House.&lt;ref name="Allen, Kenneth S. 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/19/4/134.pdf|format=PDF|title=A Senator's Quest To Beat Cancer|website=Content.healthaffairs.org|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; But his efforts on behalf of Democrat-turned-Republican Congressman [[Eugene Atkinson]] of Pennsylvania ended in defeat,&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, William, ''The New York Times'',  October 17, 1981, "PENNSYLVANIANS HOPING TO BENEFIT IN LEGISLATOR'S SHIFT TO G.O.P."&lt;/ref&gt; as did the Congressional campaign in Westchester County of John Fossel, chairman of Oppenheimer Funds.&lt;ref name="Purdum"/&gt;

That year, NCPAC (with Finkelstein as pollster-strategist) was successful in only one targeted race (helping to oust Democrat [[Howard Cannon]] in Nevada), failed in several others (e.g. Maryland),&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Donald P., Washington Post, June 3, 1981, "Rep. Holt Working Toward A Challenge of Sen. Sarbanes; GOP Rep. Marjorie S. Holt Working Toward Challenging Democratic Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes"&lt;/ref&gt; and thereafter declined in influence. The pitfalls of running IEs and campaigns at the same time were illustrated when NCPAC was sued for running ads in early 1982 against New York Sen. [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]]—around the same time as Finkelstein was working for GOP Senate candidate [[Bruce Caputo]].&lt;ref&gt;Albin Krebs and Robert McG. Thomas, ''The New York Times'', September 16, 1981, "NOTES ON PEOPLE; Senator Moynihan Gets a Challenger for 1982 "&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, a federal court ruled against NCPAC, and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' editorialized, "Both NCPAC and the Caputo campaign used the same pollster, Arthur Finkelstein. They could hardly be said to be independent unless the Caputo side of Mr. Finkelstein's brain refrained from communicating with the NCPAC side."&lt;ref&gt;"The FEC's Good News", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 22, 1986, p. A18&lt;/ref&gt; (Finkelstein himself was not sued or charged; ironically, Caputo's campaign had imploded after revelations he'd lied about serving in the military, and Moynihan was never seriously challenged.)&lt;ref&gt;Edsall, Thomas B., "Election Law Violations Admitted in '82 Race", ''The Washington Post'', January 20, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1987, Finkelstein was doing surveys for NCPAC (e.g. in New Mexico).&lt;ref&gt;NCPAC Release on New Mexico and [[Jeff Bingaman]], April 30, 1987; accessed through PR Newswire.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1980s, Finkelstein became involved in international polling, for groups such as Canada's [[National Citizens Coalition]]&lt;ref&gt;United Press International, January 13, 1983, "Clark's popularity in decline, poll says"&lt;/ref&gt; and (in 1986) the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]] after losing their majority in the [[Ontario Legislature]] following the 1985 elections.&lt;ref&gt;Speirs, Rosemary, "The Tories' desperate bid to hang on", ''Toronto Star'', October 15, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1984 election cycle saw him involved in three pitched battles for the Senate, the most heralded being the challenge of Democratic Governor [[Jim Hunt]] to Helms in North Carolina. The Ellis-Wrenn-Finkelstein team used the permanent assets of the [[National Congressional Club]] to wage a three-year campaign to undermine Hunt,&lt;ref name="Christensen, Rob 2017"/&gt; including a groundbreaking opposition-research and advertising effort that redefined the popular governor as a tax-raising national Democrat.&lt;ref name="Allen, Kenneth S. 1988"/&gt; Helms won with 52%, in what was then the most expensive Senate race in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=FF8B80E5-3048-5C12-004D234BCA6E32A4|title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 16, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716055026/http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=FF8B80E5-3048-5C12-004D234BCA6E32A4|archivedate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was the last Helms campaign on which Finkelstein would serve as pollster. Before Helms' 1990 re-election campaign, Finkelstein told the North Carolina team he couldn't work for the Senator any more. According to Carter Wrenn the New Yorker was polite about it, didn't offer a reason and recommended one of his proteges, John McLaughlin, handle the survey and strategy work. At the time, Helms was becoming one of the leading critics of the gay rights movement. "I took it that Arthur wasn't comfortable with Jesse's stand on the social issues," Wrenn said, and chalked it up to Finkelstein's libertarian views.&lt;ref name="Christensen, Rob 2017"/&gt;

in November 1984, Finkelstein also found success in New Hampshire, as he aided freshman conservative Sen. [[Gordon Humphrey]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary McGrory|McGrory, Mary]], "Sen. Humphrey's Unexpected Stand With the MX Mavericks", ''The Washington Post'', June 2, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; in overcoming a tough challenge from long-time Democratic Congressman [[Norman D'Amours]]. But in Massachusetts, after winning a contested primary against [[Elliot Richardson]],&lt;ref&gt;Black, Chris, ''Boston Globe'', September 9, 1984, "GOP SENATE RACE A STUDY IN CONTRASTS"&lt;/ref&gt; businessman [[Ray Shamie]] lost a close uphill battle to Lt. Gov. [[John Kerry]] for the Senate seat vacated by [[Paul Tsongas]].&lt;ref&gt;Scammon, Richard ''et al'', ''America Votes 16 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 1984'' (CQ Press, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Another client, Congressman [[Tom Corcoran (politician)|Tom Corcoran]], failed to dislodge incumbent [[Charles H. Percy|Charles Percy]] from the Senate nomination in Illinois, despite tough ads (attributed to Finkelstein) suggesting Percy was personally close to [[PLO]] leader [[Yasser Arafat]].&lt;ref name="Neal, Steve 1986"&gt;Neal, Steve, "Dirty Political Ads Can Muddy the Perpetrator", ''Chicago Tribune'', April 13, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

His Congressional clients in 1984 included three New Yorkers -- [[Joseph DioGuardi]] (who won election in Westchester County),&lt;ref&gt;Feron, James, ''The New York Times'',  October 5, 1986, "Abzug and DioGuardi On Road to November"&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Quinn (who lost in Nassau County)&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Frank.  "A WEALTHY NOVICE TAKES ON INCUMBENT FOR SEAT IN CONGRESS", ''The New York Times'', October 28, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Serphin Maltese]] (who lost a close race for [[Geraldine Ferraro]]'s seat in Queens).&lt;ref&gt;Maltese campaign press release, October 19, 1984, accessed through PR Newswire&lt;/ref&gt; He helped guide [[Bill Cobey]] to an upset victory for Congress in North Carolina against incumbent [[Ike Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Andrew &amp; Timothy Bannon, "GOP House gains tied to money, religious groups", United Press International, November 11, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Finkelstein polled for the gubernatorial campaign of Virginia Attorney General [[Marshall Coleman]], losing the nomination to Wyatt Durrette (who was then defeated by Democrat [[Gerald Baliles]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, Tom, "Coleman Poll Shows Voters Favor Him for Va. Governor; Durrette, Parris Dismiss Effect of Survey", ''The Washington Post'', November 15, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Republicans lost their Senate majority in the November 1986 midterm elections. Nevertheless, Finkelstein's leading clients won re-election — [[Alfonse D'Amato]] in New York,&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Frank, ''The New York Times'', October 20, 1986, "Aggressive Tactics Raise $7.7 million for D'Amato"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Don Nickles]] in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstel, Steve, United Press International, April 20, 1986, "Political Notebook"&lt;/ref&gt; However, his candidate to succeed John East in North Carolina, [[David Funderburk]], lost his primary,&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Journal]]'', May 3, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and he fared no better in Ohio, where Congressman [[Tom Kindness]] made little headway against incumbent Sen. [[John Glenn]] as well as in Illinois, where state legislator [[Judy Koehler]] failed to dislodge Senator [[Alan Dixon]].&lt;ref name="Neal, Steve 1986"/&gt;  Finkelstein also steered Californian [[Elton Gallegly]] to his initial victory for Congress,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Alan C., "Gallegly Bets on Force of Incumbency", ''Los Angeles Times'', June 6, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to push State Sen. [[Edward M. Davis|Ed Davis]] to victory in the California U.S. Senate primary.&lt;ref&gt;Love, Keith &amp; Balzar, John, ''Los Angeles Times'', September 8, 1985, "Fear of Cranston, Unrest Clouding GOP Convention"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985–87, Finkelstein was part of the team advising former U.N. Ambassador [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]] for a possible campaign for the Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Sneed, Michael et al, Inc Hears That (column), ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', May 1, 1985, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edsall, Thomas B., "Kirkpatrick Indicates Interest in White House; Kemp May Suffer if Ex-Envoy Runs", ''The Washington Post'', October 17, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkpatrick ultimately declined to run.

The Florida Senate contest of 1988 — closest in the country that year — was among Finkelstein's signature efforts.&lt;ref&gt;''St. Petersburg Times'', November 8, 1987, "Mack brings in some big guns"&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman [[Connie Mack III]] won a tougher-than-expected primary, but his campaign did not wait for the results of the early-October Democratic runoff.&lt;ref&gt;Blanton, Donna, ''Orlando Sentinel'', November 9, 1988, "MacKay, Mack Cliffhanger Down to Absentees"&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein determined (correctly) that Congressman [[Buddy MacKay]] would emerge from the bitter face-off, and began running TV and radio ads re-defining MacKay through his liberal voting record, with the tagline, "Hey Buddy, You're a Liberal."&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Kenneth S., ''St. Petersburg Times'', October 30, 1988, "Candidates turn up 'contrast' in TV ads"&lt;/ref&gt; MacKay's primary and runoff campaign had focused on ethics&lt;ref&gt;Zaldivar, R.A., Paul Anderson &amp; Mark Silva, "Democrats Turn TV Into Senate Title Bout", ''Miami Herald'', September 21, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; — appropriate for defeating Democrat [[Bill Gunter]], but useless against Mack — and he failed to blunt the ideological attack. Still, the "Hey Buddy" ads were unpopular with the press, and 22 of 23 Florida daily newspapers endorsed MacKay.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Robert, "Democrat Battles Tide in Florida", ''The Washington Post'', November 5, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mack continued to press the liberal vs. conservative contrast in debates and ads,&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, David, ''St. Petersburg Times'', October 31, 1988, "MacKay labors as Mack glides"&lt;/ref&gt; closing with endorsements by the highly popular [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]], plus footage of MacKay endorsing various tax increases. A slight majority of voters casting ballots on Election Day backed MacKay,&lt;ref&gt;Kleindienst, Linda,  "Local Absentee Votes May Decide Governor's Race", ''South Florida Sun-Sentinel'', November 2, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; but an aggressive GOP absentee-voter program&lt;ref&gt;"Mack May Owe Victory to Party's Absentee-Voter Drive", ''Orlando Sentinel'', November 12, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; had already banked a margin of tens of thousands of votes,&lt;ref&gt;Babcock, Charles R., "Being There Unnecessary for Republican Victories - GOP Credited in Rounding Up Absentee Voters", ''The Washington Post'', November 25, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mack was elected senator by a total of 34,512 votes out of 4 million cast.&lt;ref&gt;Scammon, Richard ''et al'', ''America Votes 18 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 1988'' (CQ Press, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein also advised [[Joe Malone (politician)|Joe Malone]] in his campaign against Massachusetts Sen. [[Edward Kennedy]];&lt;ref&gt;United Press International,  September 1, 1988, "Dukakis shown hurting in home state"&lt;/ref&gt; Malone lost with 34%, but gained enough positive recognition that, in 1990, he was elected Treasurer in the overwhelmingly Democratic state. Another client, [[Joseph DioGuardi]], lost his congressional re-election contest in New York, 47.5% to 50.3%, to [[Nita Lowey]].&lt;ref&gt;Feron, James, ''The New York Times'', October 23, 1988, "A Quickening Congressional Race"&lt;/ref&gt; But, in another tight contest decided by absentee voters, [[Denny Smith]] won re-election to Congress in Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Post'', November 12, 1988, "Rep. Denny Smith Wins a Squeaker"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus on New York, 1989–94==
Brooklyn native Finkelstein had long advised local and state party organizations in New York (e.g., the powerful GOP committees of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]],&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Frank, "Suburbs' Power Mirrored in Tally of G.O.P. Victories", ''The New York Times'', November 9, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]]&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Frank, "D'Amato Victory Increases Stature of Island in G.O.P.", ''The New York Times'', September 14, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Suffolk]] Counties,&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Frank, "Shoreham Issue Splits Party Ranks in Suffolk", ''The New York Times'', October 16, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; then dominant in all three suburban areas).

In 1989, he dove into the contentious world of New York City politics. [[Rudolph Giuliani]]'s initial candidacy for Mayor was met with a primary challenge by cosmetics billionaire [[Ronald Lauder]], backed by Sen. D'Amato and guided by Finkelstein.&lt;ref&gt;Duggan, Dennis, ''Newsday'', January 31, 1989, "'Resources' to Be Competitive"&lt;/ref&gt; The Giuliani-D'Amato feud had begun in 1988 over the selection of Rudy's successor as [[U.S. Attorney]] for the [[Southern District of New York]];&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Frank, "G.O.P. Battling Over Giuliani's Future", ''The New York Times'', January 13, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; it colored Republican politics in the Empire State for the next several years. In this first skirmish, Lauder's millions of dollars' worth of hard-hitting advertising failed to prevent Giuliani's winning the GOP nomination. (Giuliani later blamed Lauder's primary ads for his narrow loss to [[David Dinkins]] that November.)&lt;ref&gt;Borsellino, Robert, "Giuliani Won't Run for Governor, Hints At Challenging D'Amato", ''Albany Times Union'', March 16, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, in the disastrous 1990 gubernatorial election, GOP nominee [[Pierre Rinfret]] nearly finished in third place (behind [[Conservative Party of New York State]] upstart [[Herbert London]]). D'Amato, and by extension Finkelstein, assumed dominance over the moribund state party apparatus. Long-time [[Rensselaer County]] activist [[William Powers (politician)|William Powers]], a staunch D'Amato ally, was named chairman, and began the rebuilding process.&lt;ref&gt;Borsellino, Robert, "Powers Elected to Lead Battered GOP", ''Albany Times Union'', January 15, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; (D'Amato allies had started their own state PAC in 1989, the Committee for New York, in order to aid Republicans independent of the decaying party team.&lt;ref&gt;"GOP PAC Supported D'Amato's Cause; State Contributions Skirt Federal Limits", ''Newsday'', May 24, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;)

At this time, the Reaganite Finkelstein was not a fan of the current Administration of [[George H.W. Bush]]. In a rare public appearance in February 1991, after the GOP's poor national showing in the November 1990 elections, he reminded a conservative audience that Reagan prospered through unabashed ideological appeals that drew crossover votes from sympathetic Democrats. But Bush and other GOP candidates "kicked that away" in 1990 by raising taxes, sidestepping abortion and other social issues, and soft-pedaling their anti-communism while rooting for [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to succeed. "We are going to have to go back to the things that got us here," Finkelstein said.&lt;ref&gt;Harwood, John, "National Conservatives Concerned About Movement's Future", ''St. Petersburg Times'', February 8, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, D'Amato faced mounting ethical problems, and these occupied much of Finkelstein's time in 1990 and 1991. Though the New York senator was ultimately cleared by the [[Senate Ethics Committee]] in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Douglas, "Ethics Panel Absolves D'Amato; Ruling Chides Senator for Allowing Misuse of Office", ''Buffalo News'', August 3, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; he was the subject of ceaseless negative news stories and editorials.

When CBS's ''[[60 Minutes]]'' ran a highly damaging story on D'Amato, Finkelstein produced a response program that refuted many of its charges and misstatements.&lt;ref&gt;Schanberg, Sydney, "Chutzpah Stars on the Senator Al Show", ''Newsday'', May 31, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; All the while, D'Amato's aggressive casework program and advocacy for New York interests was emphasized in paid and earned media.&lt;ref name="Purdum"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/nyregion/1994-campaign-strategists-2-wizards-smoke-mirror-trade-guiding-cuomo-pataki.html|work=The New York Times|title=THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE STRATEGISTS; The 2 Wizards of the Smoke-and-Mirror Trade Guiding Cuomo and Pataki|first=Todd S.|last=Purdum|date=November 4, 1994|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, going into his 1992 re-election campaign, D'Amato was shown in surveys to be a near-certain loser to most prospective challengers. The indictment of his brother, [[Armand D'Amato]], on two dozen counts of [[mail fraud]] in March 1992 darkened the clouds further.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Nicholas and Alan Eysen, "Consensus: A Bad Blow To Senator's Campaign", ''Newsday'', March 12, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Democrats nominated Attorney General [[Robert Abrams]] in September, Finkelstein's polls showed D'Amato down 25 points, just seven weeks before the election.&lt;ref&gt;D'Amato, Alfonse M., ''Power, Pasta and Politics: The World According to Senator Al D'Amato'' (New York: Hyperion, 1995), p. 225&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With the huge lead enjoyed by Democratic presidential nominee [[Bill Clinton]] in New York, the Bush-Quayle ticket was a positive drag on D'Amato. As with the Mack-MacKay race in 1988, Finkelstein moved to define Abrams by his liberal positions on issues. Support for a single-payer national health scheme was translated into "a 6% tax on every job in America"—a contention never challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyJl4DDA1KQ|title=Al D'Amato Campaign Ad - 1992 -  New York Senate Race|first=|last=Random Stuff I Find on VHS|date=January 16, 2011|accessdate=August 26, 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His backing for other tax increases was documented and publicized in TV and radio ads, with the tagline, "Bob Abrams: Hopelessly liberal".&lt;ref name="samroberts"/&gt;

The D'Amato campaign was no less bold on the ethics issue, repeating [[pay-for-play]] charges made by ex-Rep. [[Geraldine Ferraro]] during the Democratic primary, with ads featuring excerpts from the Abrams-Ferraro debate. When news stories late in the campaign revealed the nominee's disallowed business-tax deductions, Finkelstein's closing ad ran: "Bob Abrams never met a tax he didn't like ... except his own."&lt;ref&gt;D'Amato, Alfonse M., ''Power, Pasta and Politics: The World According to Senator Al D'Amato'' (New York: Hyperion, 1995), p. 229&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN neede --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On Election Day 1992, as [[Bill Clinton]] was winning New York State by 16 points, D'Amato won re-election by 1.2 points, a margin of 80,794 votes — with a wave of Clinton-D'Amato split-ticket voting&lt;ref&gt;Halverson, Guy &amp; Mouat, Lucia, "Campaign '92 Most Mid-Atlantic Incumbents Win", ''Christian Science Monitor'', November 6, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; in Brooklyn, Queens and Buffalo the deciding factor.

Finkelstein had several other results that day. In North Carolina, he helped the Ellis-Wrenn-Congressional Club team guide businessman and former Democrat [[Lauch Faircloth]] to victory over incumbent Sen. [[Terry Sanford]].&lt;ref name="Christensen, Rob 2017"/&gt; [[Don Nickles]] easily won a third term as senator from Oklahoma. But in Illinois, the candidacy of [[Richard S. Williamson|Rich Williamson]] failed to defeat Democrat [[Carol Moseley Braun]] to replace Sen. [[Alan Dixon]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

D'Amato's comeback win had demonstrated the Republicans' window of opportunity in New York City's [[outer boroughs]], among working-class Catholics&lt;ref&gt;Keeler, Bob, ''Newsday'', November 5, 1992, "His Winning Ways on Ropes, D'Amato Found Fighting Legs"&lt;/ref&gt; and (especially) Jewish voters angered by Democratic leaders' handling of the [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] violence and subsequent incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, Elizabeth, "U.S. Senate Second-Guessing Abrams' Effort", ''Newsday'', November 5, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The senator's ticket-splitting performance had the effect of shielding downticket candidates from the Bush debacle, and Republicans actually made Congressional gains in strong D'Amato areas — e.g., working-class Buffalo ([[John Quinn (New York politician)|Jack Quinn]]),&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Robert J., "Local Election Results Defy Definition, Experts Say Voters Reject Traditional Party Loyalty, Exercise Independent Thinking", ''Buffalo News'', November 8, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and suburban Long Island ([[Rick Lazio]])&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Lawrence C., "L.I.'s Strong Message to the Republicans", ''Newsday'', November 5, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; — while holding the majority in the powerful State Senate, which strengthened the hand of D'Amato, Finkelstein and Powers going into 1993 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Maurice, Newsday, December 31, 1993, "POLS &amp; POLITICS Republicans Are Gunning For Guv Race"&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani's second Mayoral campaign in 1993 benefited from the resurgent New York GOP. He had made a point of endorsing the Senator for re-election,&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Maurice, "City Pols: What's In It For Me? Ponder Vote's Local Impact", ''Newsday'', November 5, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and D'Amato and Finkelstein did not again back a primary challenger. This time, Giuliani ran a more effective race, riding to victory on a wave of discontent with incumbent [[David Dinkins]], with even stronger turnout among ethnic Catholics and Jewish voters than in 1989, and in the same areas where D'Amato had done well a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;William Bunch, Michael H. Cottman and Mitch Gelman, "A Rudy Makeover Polish paved way to win", ''Newsday'', November 4, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York City in November 1993, Finkelstein and [[Ronald Lauder]] also guided to victory a measure limiting the terms of elected city officials.&lt;ref name="stevenleemyers"&gt;Myers, Steven Lee, [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/03/nyregion/new-yorkers-approve-limit-of-2-terms-for-city-officials.html "New Yorkers Approve Limit of 2 Terms for City Officials"], ''The New York Times'', November 3, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' called this vote "a terrific defeat for the city's mostly Democratic political establishment, which had fought in court throughout the summer to kill the referendum, only to have the state's highest court order it on the ballot just two weeks [before the election]."&lt;ref name="stevenleemyers"/&gt;

Finkelstein had specialized in federal elections to this point, and it was uncertain how he would adapt to the localized issues and personal style of a gubernatorial contest. Reluctantly at first, and only after considering several alternative candidates, he and D'Amato settled on supporting little-known State Senator [[George Pataki]] of [[Peekskill]] for Governor in 1994.&lt;ref name="Pataki, George 1998 pp. 69–72"&gt;Pataki, George, with Daniel Paisner, ''Pataki: An Autobiography'' (New York: Viking, 1998), pp. 69–72&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They guided him through the State Convention in May, and to a smashing 3-to-1 primary victory in September over [[Nelson Rockefeller]]'s longtime political wheelhorse Richard Rosenbaum.&lt;ref&gt;Humbert, Marc, "Cuomo, Pataki Win Primaries, Face Showdown", Associated Press, September 14, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main challenge was defining the race against Cuomo. Finkelstein's first ad radiated disappointment and sowed seeds of disbelief: "Desperate candidates do desperate things ... [[Mario Cuomo]] could have been senator or President ..."&lt;ref&gt;AP story by Marc Humbert in ''Albany Times Union'', September 16, 1994, "Cuomo's Campaign Takes Both High Road and Low Road"&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent spots, often as brief as 10 seconds, highlighted Cuomo-era failures (e.g. snarled traffic and record-high utility rates in Long Island),&lt;ref&gt;Sack, Kevin, [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/01/nyregion/1994-campaign-overview-cuomo-pataki-go-long-island-hunt-for-votes.html?pagewanted=all "THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE OVERVIEW; CUOMO AND PATAKI GO TO LONG ISLAND IN HUNT FOR VOTES"], ''The New York Times'', November 1, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Ian,  [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/nyregion/the-1994-campaign-issues-clamor-over-death-penalty-dominates-debate-on-crime.html?pagewanted=all "THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: ISSUES; Clamor Over Death Penalty Dominates Debate on Crime"], ''The New York Times'', October 9, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially the litany of tax increases over his 12 years. The persistent tagline: "Mario Cuomo: Too liberal for too long."&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Nicholas &amp; John Riley, "Pataki: Cuomo 'Too Too' Challenger unveils ads attacking governor", ''Newsday'', September 15, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pataki introduced himself in ads first as a gentle reformer, then angry in responding to Cuomo attacks, and finally enthusiastic (in excerpts from rally speeches at campaign's close). Cuomo defended his record and played up D'Amato's sponsorship of Pataki's campaign (to the tune of [[Paul Simon]]'s "[[You Can Call Me Al]]"), but had trouble overcoming the anti-incumbent tide.&lt;ref name="Purdum"/&gt; Pataki had a slight lead in public surveys when, on October 24, Giuliani endorsed Cuomo, with attacks on his fellow Republican quickly becoming a staple on evening news programs.&lt;ref&gt;Purdum, Todd, [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/25/nyregion/1994-campaign-analysis-who-can-most-mayor-s-endorsement-cuomo-reflects-political.html "THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: NEWS ANALYSIS - Who Can Do the Most?; Mayor's Endorsement of Cuomo Reflects Political Interests and Financial Realities"], ''The New York Times'', October 25, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Poll numbers fluctuated wildly, with Finkelstein's own tracking survey showing a Cuomo lead ballooning to 13 points within days.&lt;ref&gt;A ''The New York Times''/WCBS survey, completed 5 days after Giuliani's endorsement, showed Cuomo at 44%, Pataki at 34%.&lt;br&gt;See Moody, Nekesa Mumbi, Associated Press, October 30, 1994, "National Republicans Go After Mayor for Endorsing Democrat Governor".&lt;/ref&gt; It required a swift response. He elected to attack Giuliani's endorsement as a corrupt deal with Cuomo,&lt;ref&gt;Purdum, Todd, [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/02/nyregion/1994-campaign-ad-campaign-race-for-governor-pataki-says-cuomo-buying-election.html "THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN; Race for Governor: Pataki Says Cuomo Is Buying Election"], ''The New York Times'', November 2, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; the ad using headlines citing suspiciously timed New York State grants to the City to suggest the Governor had used taxpayer money to buy the Mayor's backing.&lt;ref name="Pataki, George 1998 pp. 69–72"/&gt; Pataki relentlessly pushed this argument in public appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, John, ''Newsday'', October 29, 1994, "Pataki on New Offensive"&lt;/ref&gt;

The pendulum swung back, with negative reaction to Giuliani especially strong Upstate and in the Metro North and Long Island suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Charisse, [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/28/us/1994-campaign-campaign-upstate-pataki-s-new-message-giuliani-endorsement-has.html "THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE CAMPAIGN; Upstate, Pataki's New Message: Giuliani Endorsement Has Price"], ''The New York Times'', October 28, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; (GOP protestors even chased the Mayor's plane on an airport tarmac during a statewide flyaround for Cuomo.) Pataki closed the sale with an energetic tour of the state, appearing alone on a WCBS-TV Election Eve program when Cuomo refused a one-on-one debate.&lt;ref&gt;Pleven, Liam &amp; John Riley,  "Upstate key for Pataki", ''Newsday'', November 8, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The final result: Pataki defeated Cuomo by 4 points. In an historic Republican landslide year, Mario Cuomo was the most prominent Democrat to fall. As [[Todd Purdum]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote that November, "For good or ill, Mr. Pataki's campaign [wa]s almost entirely a creation of Mr. Finkelstein."&lt;ref name="Purdum"/&gt;

Delaware provided another win for Finkelstein in November 1994, as longtime Senator [[Bill Roth (politician)|Bill Roth]] coasted to victory for his fifth term, 56% to 44%.&lt;ref&gt;Scammon, Richard ''et al'', ''America Votes 21 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 1994'' (CQ Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

==NRSC, Netanyahu, and Being 'Outed,' 1995–96==
Following Election Day 1994, D'Amato and Finkelstein were handed new challenges and opportunities, as the 14-year incumbent was named by his Senate peers as chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] (NRSC), one of the four permanent GOP campaign operations in Washington. They had a tough act to follow — [[Phil Gramm]] of Texas had just piloted Republicans to a 7-seat gain and recaptured control of the Senate. For Finkelstein, it was his first bow as an inside player on a Washington campaign committee, his dealings previously being as representative of an individual candidate. Now he and D'Amato were responsible for helping to direct Senate campaigns in 33 states simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, Steven,  [http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/19/gop-campaign-guru-arthur-finkelstein-dies-at-72-241826 "GOP campaign guru Arthur Finkelstein dies at 72"], Politico, August 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of their first moves was to break the cycle of hiring parochial-minded Senate aides to manage the sprawling committee; their choice for Executive Director was [[John Heubusch]] (later a top executive with [[Gateway Computers]] and head of the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation]]). Other key hires were [[Jo Anne B. Barnhart]] as Political Director, and [[Gordon Hensley]] as Communications Director.&lt;ref&gt;"Politics' Fabulous Fifty", ''Roll Call'', September 23, 1996, p. A24.&lt;/ref&gt; (Barnhart was a long-time aide and campaigner for Sen. [[William V. Roth, Jr.|William Roth]], and later served as Commissioner of the [[Social Security Administration]].) All three were singled out by ''Roll Call'' newspaper in 1996 as among national "Politics' Fabulous Fifty."&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Charles E.,  "Political Surveyor" column, p. 5, ''Roll Call'', December 12, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRSC faced several challenges beyond their control, many emanating from the two dominant Republicans of 1995–96, House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and Senate Majority Leader [[Bob Dole]]. The [[Oklahoma City bombing]] had given President [[Bill Clinton]] an opportunity to marginalize his opponents, and slowed the momentum of the reform-minded Republican Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Many sources, e.g. http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2010/04/remembering_oklahoma_city_and.html and https://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/flashback-how-clinton-exploited-oklahoma-city-for-political-gain/Content?oid=2167590&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1995, unrelenting Democratic/press attacks, and his own missteps, had turned Gingrich into a pariah through much of the country (2-to-1 unfav-fav ratio in surveys); meanwhile, Dole was running for President, and allowing ambition to overshadow his Senate work. In mid-1996, Dole resigned from the Senate to campaign full-time, but by then he was behind Clinton to stay, and eventually polled less than 41% nationwide.&lt;ref name="Scammon, Richard 1997"&gt;Scammon, Richard ''et al'', ''America Votes 22 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 1996'' (CQ Press, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Amato remained personally devoted to Dole, but Finkelstein and the NRSC team urged Republican Senate candidates to cut loose from unpopular national leaders and carve their own individual profiles on issues.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, David, [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/27/us/gop-hopes-for-senate-ride-on-pollster-s-tactics.html "G.O.P. Hopes for Senate Ride on Pollster's Tactics"], ''The New York Times'', October 27, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Amato remained a champion fundraiser and the committee found new legal ways to deliver assistance to Senate campaigns and local parties. The NRSC paid particular attention to blunting the wave of millionaire political unknowns (e.g., [[Tom Bruggere]] in Oregon, Elliott Close in South Carolina) recruited that year by the Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;Schantz, Harvey, [https://books.google.com/books?id=su-S6liKHx4C&amp;pg=PT261&amp;lpg=PT261&amp;dq=bruggere+d%27amato+1996&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3ipTXO02cf&amp;sig=k6YYspmL0DRRCgBhxMtEx5IMOw8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX1-mb1-TVAhUn94MKHS4nCXQQ6AEIVDAM#v=onepage&amp;q=bruggere%20d'amato%201996&amp;f=false ''Politics in an Era of Divided Government: The Election of 1996 and its Aftermath'', pp. 93-99]; accessed August 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It shored up many endangered incumbents, including [[Robert C. Smith|Bob Smith]] (New Hampshire), [[John Warner]] (Virginia), 75-year-old Jesse Helms (North Carolina) and 94-year-old Strom Thurmond (South Carolina).&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz, Howard, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/10/22/gop-consultants-strategy-label-opponents-liberally/8ef6af9b-6fae-4ac0-878e-961befb62d2c/ "GOP CONSULTANT'S STRATEGY: LABEL OPPONENTS LIBERALLY"],  ''The Washington Post'', October 22, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Election Night, as Clinton defeated Dole by nearly 9 points and Gingrich's House Republicans lost a net 8 seats, Senate Republicans won open seats in Alabama, Arkansas and Nebraska, while losing South Dakota. In a poor GOP year, the D'Amato-Finkelstein NRSC had gained a net 2 seats (and narrowly missed another gain in the [[Max Cleland]] - [[Guy Millner]] race in Georgia).&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, Steven, [http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/19/gop-campaign-guru-arthur-finkelstein-dies-at-72-241826 "GOP campaign guru Arthur Finkelstein dies at 72"], Politico, August 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein was not a consultant to the Dole Presidential campaign, despite his closeness to several of its top staffers. But, in the election's waning days, ''Time'' magazine reporter Erik Pooley detected the New Yorker's influence on strategy, writing: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;For Arthur Finkelstein, this week might have been a vindication: Bob Dole finally started labeling Bill Clinton a "spend-and-tax liberal," using a crude but often effective strategy known as "Finkel-think" by some Dole advisers, because the secretive Republican strategist has been deploying it on behalf of his clients for 20 years ... These days, Finkelstein is exercising a kind of remote control. The Senator's latest brain trust is dominated by "Arthur's Boys" ... And Dole is rushing around the country chanting the Finkelstein mantra. "Liberal! Liberal! Liberal!" he cried in St. Louis, Missouri.&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"&gt;Pooley, Erik, ''Time'', October 7, 1996, "The Mystery Man Who Inspired Dole's Latest Strategy," accessed thru http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/analysis/time/9610/07/pooley.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His own statewide clients in 1996 showed a mixed record, with Senator [[Larry Pressler]] (South Dakota) and ex-Senator [[Rudy Boschwitz]] (Minnesota) both losing, albeit in close races. [[Robert C. Smith|Bob Smith]] survived with a 49% plurality win. New Jersey Congressman [[Dick Zimmer (New Jersey politician)|Dick Zimmer]] was defeated in his Senate bid against [[Robert Torricelli]].''&lt;ref&gt;Orr, J. Scott, "Hired guns add fire to Senate race", ''Star-Ledger'', October 27, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;''

Earlier in 1996, he also helped [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] oust [[Shimon Peres]] as Prime Minister of Israel in a close upset.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/news/9610/10/karl.finkelstein/index.shtml|work=CNN|title=Arthur Finkelstein: Out Of Sight But In Control|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', "Finkelstein was largely responsible for the strategy that brought Netanyahu victory in the 1996 general elections."&lt;ref&gt;Shimon, Kamoun, It's Sad To Be the Mayor of Jerusalem, ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', November 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Times of Israel]]'', "Finkelstein was behind the "Peres will divide Jerusalem" slogan that helped Netanyahu overcome Shimon Peres who had been forecast to sweep to power in the wake of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin the previous November. That election was credited with changing the tone of Israeli campaigns, bringing more American-style, aggressive and negative campaigning to Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/arthur-finklestein-master-campaign-strategist-dies-at-72 "Arthur Finklestein, strategist who helped Netanyahu to power, dies at 72"], ''Times of Israel'', August 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; But his expertise helped in subtler ways as well; biographer Neill Lochery wrote in 2016 that Finkelstein was behind such ideas as dyeing Netanyahu's salt-and-pepper hair gray to give him a more statesmanlike appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Lochery, quoted by Fisher, Ben, in ''Jerusalem Post Online'', November 24, 2016, "Books: Unstoppable Bibi"&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff Barak of the ''Jerusalem Post'', a harsh critic of Finkelstein and Netanyahu, called the strategist "the brains behind Netanyahu's first election victory in 1996. Netanyahu's campaign back then, from which he has never wavered, was that you're either for him or an enemy of the people. His campaign slogan at the time, 'Netanyahu is good for the Jews,' encapsulated this. By implication, if you're not for Netanyahu then you're not good for the Jews, and therefore an enemy. And if Netanyahu is good for the Jews, then this also not-so-subtly hints that Netanyahu's bad for the Arabs, regardless of the fact that they are supposedly citizens of equal standing who comprise around 20% of the country's population."&lt;ref&gt;Barak, Jeff, ''Jerusalem Post'', May 8, 2017, "Reality Check: Which US Jew has really influenced today's Israel?"&lt;/ref&gt;

But Finkelstein's greatest personal challenge that year came with the August issue of ''[[Boston magazine]]'', which revealed his private life as a homosexual;&lt;ref&gt;Finnegan, Michael, [http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/gop-guru-gay-sez-mag-article-1.743078 "GOP GURU GAY, SEZ MAG"], ''New York Daily News'', September 13, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; the ostensible excuse for the outing was that several Finkelstein clients had voted against gay-rights measures in Congress, and his work to elect them was therefore inconsistent and/or hypocritical. In September, D'Amato said, "I don't think a person's sexual orientation, his private life — a person's private life should be brought up and I think the question is offensive, it's wrong. He's a wonderful, decent person and whatever his sexual orientation is, that's his business."&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;

==Back to the Empire State, 1997–98==
Finkelstein's next two years anchored him again in New York, for the simultaneous re-election campaigns of Senator D'Amato and Governor Pataki in 1998. The contests were as different as the candidates themselves, with the calm, earnest Pataki winning high approval ratings and discouraging stronger Democrats from challenging him. New Yorkers' approval of Republican executives was signaled with the landslide re-election of Giuliani as Mayor in November 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone, David, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/06/nyregion/the-1997-elections-the-voters-big-victory-but-gains-for-mayor-are-modest.html "THE 1997 ELECTIONS: THE VOTERS; Big Victory, but Gains For Mayor Are Modest"], ''The New York Times'', November 6, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein crafted a highly positive campaign for Pataki, focusing on fulfillment of promises from 1994 (e.g., tax cuts) and policy innovations (the STAR tax program for seniors&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/14/.../your-home-homeowner-tax-cuts-in-new-york.html "Homeowner Tax Cuts in New York"], ''The New York Times'', December 14, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;) Raising $21 million, Pataki defeated New York City Council President [[Peter Vallone Sr.|Peter Vallone]] by 21 percentage points, polling 54.3%, the largest share by a Republican for Governor since [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Perez-Pena, Richard, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/nyregion/1998-elections-new-york-state-governor-pataki-wins-election-second-term-hefty.html "THE 1998 ELECTIONS: NEW YORK STATE -- THE GOVERNOR; Pataki Wins Election to a Second Term by a Hefty Margin"], ''The New York Times'', November 4, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Amato was another matter; since his narrow victory in 1992, his profile had grown more partisan Republican in this still-heavily Democratic state. Summoning First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] to testify before his Senate committee in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Philip, [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/03/news/the-senator-cannot-help-being-himself.html "The Senator Cannot Help Being Himself"], ''The New York Times'', March 3, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and aggressive campaigning for Dole in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/nyregion/d-amato-to-support-dole-in-96.html "D'Amato to Support Dole in '96"], ''The New York Times'', March 7, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; damaged D'Amato in a state where [[Bill Clinton]] crushed the Kansan by nearly 2-to-1 (59.5% to 30.6%), doubling his 1992 margin over Bush.&lt;ref name="Scammon, Richard 1997"/&gt;

D'Amato's decision to divorce his wife after a long separation&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/08/nyregion/d-amato-and-wife-granted-a-divorce.html "D'Amato and Wife Granted a Divorce"], ''The New York Times'', April 8, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and announce his engagement to a young socialite&lt;ref&gt;Barron, James, [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/22/nyregion/d-amato-says-he-s-in-love-he-must-be-she-s-a-democrat.html "D'Amato Says He's in Love. He Must Be: She's a Democrat"], ''The New York Times'', February 22, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; did not help his favorable ratings, while others recalled his mock-Japanese impression of [[O.J. Simpson]] case Judge [[Lance Ito]] in 1995 (for which he was forced to apologize on the Senate floor).&lt;ref&gt;Henneberger, Melinda, [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/07/nyregion/d-amato-gives-a-new-apology-on-ito-remarks.html "D'Amato Gives A New Apology On Ito Remarks"], ''The New York Times'', April 7, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Amato raised a record $26 million for the 1998 campaign, and Finkelstein went to work early shoring up his client's "Senator Pothole" image of close attention to local needs and the problems of individual New Yorkers (as he had done successfully in 1992).&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Alessandra, [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/19/nyregion/senator-pothole-s-ultimate-race-al-d-amato-runs-big-guy-for-all-those-little.html?pagewanted=all "Senator Pothole's Ultimate Race; Al D'Amato Runs as the Big Guy for All Those Little Guys"], ''The New York Times'', October 19, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; State polls showed a swing back to such issues as health care and social concerns, which needed to be addressed. The tagline of these ads: "Al D'Amato Cares, Al D'Amato Makes a Difference, Al D'Amato Gets Things Done."&lt;ref&gt;Berkowitz, Harry, "Riding the Airwaves, D'Amato Hones Image", ''Newsday'', August 28, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democratic primary was ultimately between Queens politician [[Geraldine Ferraro]] and U.S. Representative [[Charles Schumer]] of Brooklyn. Finkelstein prepared for both eventualities. When Schumer won by a surprisingly large margin, he immediately began ads that raised questions about the candidate's work ethic. (As Congressman, Schumer had missed an inordinate number of committee meetings.)&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Joel. "Attending to Issues: Al Scolds Chuck For Votes He Missed in House", ''New York Daily News'', October 22, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected line of attack stymied the Democrat in late September and early October, and despite his weaknesses D'Amato gamely held onto a lead.&lt;ref name="Albany Times-Union' 1998"&gt;''Albany Times-Union'' poll, cited in ''New York Post'',  October 24, 1998, "PUTZ' CHUCK ; SAYS AL LIED ABOUT IT ; D'AMATO GIVES BRUSHOFF: "IT FITS' by ROBERT HARDT Jr. &amp; GREGG BIRNBAUM&lt;/ref&gt;

All this collapsed in late October, after a remarkable show of hubris and bad judgment at a closed-door meeting with Jewish supporters in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name="Albany Times-Union' 1998"/&gt; First, D'Amato did a waddling impression of then-obese Democratic U.S. Rep. [[Jerrold Nadler]].&lt;ref&gt;Halbfinger, David, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/23/nyregion/the-1998-campaign-the-senate-d-amato-says-he-s-sorry-but-not-to-schumer.html "THE 1998 CAMPAIGN -- THE SENATE; D'Amato Says He's Sorry, but Not to Schumer"], ''The New York Times'', October 23, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the meeting, he referred to Schumer as a "putzhead" (a mangling of the [[Yiddish]] vulgarism "[[wikt:putz|putz]]"). He later denied using this characterization, during questions from reporters (but was swiftly contradicted by his own supporters, present at the meeting, including [[Ed Koch]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Nagourney|Nagourney, Adam]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/22/nyregion/1998-campaign-senate-schumer-fires-counterattack-d-amato-holocaust.html "THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE SENATE; Schumer Fires Counterattack at D'Amato on the Holocaust"], ''The New York Times'', October 22, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Film of the denial was turned into a Schumer TV ad within days.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, Blaine, "The Gaffe Heard 'Round N.Y.; D'Amato Campaign Slowed By His Insult of Schumer", ''The Washington Post'', October 28, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein's tracking survey the night of D'Amato's "putzhead" comment showed the senator leading Schumer by 10 points with two weeks to go. But the meltdown was quick and decisive, especially among Jewish voters,&lt;ref&gt;Birnbaum, Gregg &amp; Robert Hardt, Jr., ''New York Post'', November 4, 1998, "Too Many Flubs Doomed D'Amato"&lt;/ref&gt; with Schumer's ads relentlessly driving the message of D'Amato's dishonesty and dislikeability. The Democrat's closing tagline was itself a homage to Finkelstein: "D'Amato: Too many lies for too long." Schumer won, 54.6% to 44.1%—a 20-point turnaround.&lt;ref&gt;Brand, Rick, Newsday, November 4, 1998, "ELECTION '98 / Schumer Topples Senator D'Amato / 'The battle is over,' incumbent concedes"&lt;/ref&gt;

In other races that year, Sen. [[Lauch Faircloth]]—who had earlier replaced Finkelstein for his 1998 reelection campaign in North Carolina — brought him back into the fold in the closing weeks of the race. (Faircloth ultimately lost a close contest to Democrat [[John Edwards]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/19/gop-campaign-guru-arthur-finkelstein-dies-at-72-241826|title=GOP campaign guru Arthur Finkelstein dies at 72|website=Politico.com|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later clients and campaigns, 1999–2017==
===International===
In the 2000s, Finkelstein spent more time working overseas than in previous decades, with clients in [[Albania]], [[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Kosovo]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Azerbijan]] (the last, in coordination with [[George Birnbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Azerbaijan News Gazette'', October 4, 2016, "EU Reporter: Polls show occupied region is main concern in Azerbaijan"&lt;/ref&gt;) He continued to consult in Israeli elections, working again for [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]   in 1999, [[Ariel Sharon]] (whom he helped become Prime Minister in 2001&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/arthur-finkelstein-shadowy-campaign-mastermind-and-gop-operative-dies-at-72/2017/08/19/0bd638c6-84e8-11e7-902a-2a9f2d808496_story.html|title=Arthur Finkelstein, quietly influential GOP campaign mastermind, dies at 72|website=Washington Post|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and finally [[Avigdor Lieberman]] and his [[Yisrael Beytenu]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/arthur-finklestein-master-campaign-strategist-dies-at-72/|title=Arthur Finkelstein, strategist who helped Netanyahu to power, dies at 72|website=Timesofisrael.com|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida===
Having twice steered [[Connie Mack III]] to Senate victories in 1988 and 1994, Finkelstein was in demand for the 2000 Florida contest upon Mack's retirement. His candidate was 10-term Congressman [[Bill McCollum]], and he helped clear the Republican field early in anticipation of a tough general election against Insurance Commissioner [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;Bousquet, Steve, ''Miami Herald'', November 1, 2000, "MCCOLLUM USES `L-WORD,' CALLS NELSON A LIBERAL"&lt;/ref&gt; It was a nail-biter with many echoes of the 1988 Senate campaign, but with a different outcome. As enthusiasm among Republican voters faltered in the final days (after revelations of [[George W. Bush]]'s 1976 DUI conviction), GOP coattails and McCollum's slim lead disappeared, and Nelson was elected, 51% to 46%.&lt;ref name="Scammon, Richard 2001"&gt;Scammon, Richard ''et al'', ''America Votes 24 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 2000'' (CQ Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

McCollum ran for the other Florida Senate seat on Democrat [[Bob Graham]]'s retirement in 2004, but succumbed to eventual Senator [[Mel Martinez]] after low fundraising allowed the challenger to overcome his early lead.&lt;ref&gt;Caputo, Marc, ''Miami Herald'', July 25, 2004,"IN U.S. SENATE RACE, ADS GO LONG WAY, BUT TIME IS SHORT"&lt;/ref&gt; But McCollum was more successful in 2006, when he was the consensus GOP choice for Attorney General, and defeated Democrat [[Skip Campbell]], 52.7% to 47.3%, polling well in a poor year for Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;''St. Petersburg Times'', January 28, 2009, "THE BUZZ: FLORIDA POLITICS"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 and 2010, Finkelstein helmed McCollum's campaign for Florida Governor, where he was the favorite of the state's GOP Establishment.&lt;ref&gt;''St. Petersburg Times'', May 12, 2010, "THE BUZZ: FLORIDA POLITICS"&lt;/ref&gt; These plans were upended by the surprise candidacy of wealthy businessman [[Rick Scott]], whose bottomless spending that year ($75 million from his personal coffers) led to a furious contest for the nomination. McCollum fought gamely, but lost the bid to Scott, 43.5% to 46.3%, who went on to win election to the Statehouse that November against Democrat [[Alex Sink]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Rhodes, ''America Votes 29 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 2010'' (CQ Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 open seat in Florida's 14th Congressional District allowed Finkelstein to help create a political dynasty, as he steered State Rep. [[Connie Mack IV]] to a narrow victory in a four-way primary, then general-election wins in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;''News-Press, The'' (Fort Myers, FL), July 17, 2008, "Mack prevails in fundraising"&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein served as strategist for Mack's Senate campaign in 2012;&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Alex, ''Tampa Bay Times'', July 12, 2012, "NATIONAL SUPER PACS AIM BLITZ AT NELSON "&lt;/ref&gt; a late entrant in the primary, the Congressman won the GOP nomination with 58%, but was defeated by incumbent [[Bill Nelson]] by a million votes in the Obama re-election year.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Rhodes, ''America Votes 30 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 2012'' (Sage Press, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; (Mack IV later became a lobbyist, whose clients included the government of Hungary, whose leader [[Viktor Orbán]] was a leading Finkelstein client in the 2010s.)&lt;ref&gt;Novak, Benjamin, ''Budapest Beacon'', December 13, 2016, "Connie Mack IV says blue skies and sunshine in store for US-Hungary relations,"  Accessed thru https://budapestbeacon.com/connie-mack-iv-says-blue-skies-sunshine-store-us-hungary-relations/&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===
Pataki's third gubernatorial campaign, in 2002, provided some fresh challenges to Finkelstein, including a contest for the [[Conservative Party of New York State]] nomination, a still-shrinking Republican base, and a strong third-party challenge from millionaire [[B. Thomas Golisano]], running again on the [[Independence Party of New York|Independence Party]] line.&lt;ref name="Dicker, Frederic U. 2002"&gt;Dicker, Frederic U., ''New York Post'', November 6, 2002, "WINNERS AND LOSERS"&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein positioned Pataki as an economic conservative but far more moderate on social and spending issues than in previous campaigns. This shift won the endorsement of influential union leaders such as [[Dennis Rivera]] and [[Randi Weingarten]].&lt;ref&gt;Rau, Jordan, ''Newsday'', October 11, 2002, "Hardball-Playing Pataki Hits All Bases"&lt;/ref&gt; Pataki enjoyed a 15-point victory, polling 48.3% to 32.7% for state Comptroller [[H. Carl McCall]], and 14% for Golisano.&lt;ref&gt;Scammon, Richard ''et al'', ''America Votes 25 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 2002'' (CQ Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein tried to make use of Pataki's likely coattails by helming the campaign of David Cornstein for the state Comptroller slot being vacated by McCall. Cornstein, a successful businessman and Giuliani's appointed chief of [[Off-Track Betting]], brought personal resources and a strong finance team to the table.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Thai, ''Newsday'', June 6, 2001, "State Comptroller Race Grows"&lt;/ref&gt; He was a longtime ally of both the Mayor and Governor, with a City/Long Island base and unusual appeal as a Jewish Republican running as a moderate-conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Humbert, Marc, AP story in ''Albany Times Union'', August 5, 2001, "SPENDING IS ALREADY REVVING UP FOR 2002"&lt;/ref&gt; But party regulars instead fell in decisively behind former Upstate Assemblyman [[John Faso]], a onetime legislative leader for the GOP minority, and Cornstein abandoned his run in 2001. (Faso further failed to expand his appeal beyond the limited Republican base, losing with 46.5% in November 2002; in his subsequent 2006 bid for Governor of New York, [[Eliot Spitzer]] crushed him, Faso polling just 29.2%.)&lt;ref&gt;Scammon, Richard ''et al'', ''America Votes 27 : a handbook of contemporary American election statistics, 2006'' (CQ Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in New York, Finkelstein in April 2005, Finkelstein announced the organization of [[Stop Her Now]], a [[527 committee]] dedicated to defeating then-Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[New York United States Senate election, 2006|2006 New York U.S. Senate race]]. Clinton sailed to an easy re-election, and the PAC was not a factor in the contest.&lt;ref&gt;Weigel, David, "It takes an agenda: conservatives cannot live by Hillary-hate alone", ''[[The American Conservative]]'', October 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the titanic struggle over new stadium construction on Manhattan's [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]], Finkelstein was hired to defeat the proposal by [[Cablevision]], [[Madison Square Garden Company|MSG]] and its allies;&lt;ref&gt;Janison, Dan, Newsday, May 23, 2005, "CITY HALL: Stadium a bonanza for insiders"&lt;/ref&gt; they ultimately prevailed, and the [[new Yankee Stadium]] was instead built in the Bronx, next to the old ballfield site, opening in 2009. It was the only time that the Finkelstein firm filed disclosure forms as a lobbyist (the filer was Ronald Finkelstein, not Arthur).&lt;ref&gt;New York City lobbying filings, Calendar Year 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein advised former Congressman [[Rick Lazio]] during his campaign for the 2010 Republican nomination for New York Governor.:&lt;ref&gt;''Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin'' (Binghamton, NY),  July 25, 2010, "Money crucial in governor's race"&lt;/ref&gt; Lazio lost the GOP nomination contest to businessman [[Carl Paladino]].

===North Carolina===
Finkelstein continued to partner with Carter Wrenn on Tar Heel State races after the demise of the National Congressional Club.&lt;ref name="Christensen, Rob 2017"/&gt; In 2000, former Charlotte mayor (and UNC basketball star) [[Richard Vinroot]] sought the Governorship, to succeed the term-limited Democrat [[Jim Hunt]]. Vinroot won a contested fight for the GOP nomination,&lt;ref&gt;Squitieri, Tom &amp; Welch, William M., ''USA Today'', May 1, 2000, "Primary voters to set up key state races this week"&lt;/ref&gt; but the drop in Republican-voter enthusiasm in the closing days (noted above in Florida) hurt here as well, and Vinroot was defeated by [[Mike Easley]], 44.2% to 52.4%.&lt;ref name="Scammon, Richard 2001"/&gt;

In one of Finkelstein's last major races before his death, he worked with Wrenn in 2016 to win a spirited primary fight between two sitting Congressmen -- [[George Holding]] and [[Renee Ellmers]]. Wrenn had helped Ellmers pull one of the shocking House upsets of the 2010 election, but she abandoned the veteran consultant after her swearing-in and allied herself closely with House GOP leaders. In this primary, Wrenn backed Holding (a former US Attorney he'd guided to victory in 2012 and 2014), after a court-ordered redistricting combined the constituencies of the two suburban-Raleigh members.  Aided by Wrenn's management and Finkelstein's polling and advice,&lt;ref name="Christensen, Rob 2017"/&gt; Holding crushed Ellmers, 53.4% to 23.6%, and went on to a 56% re-election in November against Democrat John P. McNeil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article112593858.html|title='Odd duck' Democrat seeks to unseat congressman in GOP-leaning 2nd District|website=newsonserver.com|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ballotpedia.org/John_McNeil_(North_Carolina)|title=John McNeil (North Carolina) |website=Ballotpedia.org|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other States and Presidential===
In Delaware, Finkelstein continued as pollster in 2000 to Senator [[Bill Roth (politician)|Bill Roth]], but the 30-year lawmaker fell to a 56%-44% defeat that November to [[Thomas Carper]].&lt;ref&gt;''Campaigns &amp; Elections'', May 2000 (Vol 21; Issue 4), "2000 Senatorial Races: Campaign Consultant Roundup"&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas businessman [[David Dewhurst]] first approached Finkelstein in 1993 about running for Governor; he advised Dewhurst against challenging [[George W. Bush]], who stormed to victory a year later. In 1998, he shepherded the millionaire to victory for the post of state Land Commissioner,&lt;ref&gt;Kuempel, George, ''Dallas Morning News'', November 4, 1998, "GOP's Dewhurst wins land commissioner race: Businessman defeats state Rep. Raymond"&lt;/ref&gt; then to two successive wins in 2002 and 2006 for the job of Lieutenant Governor.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppe, Christy, ''Dallas Morning News'', May 16, 2002, "GOP practicing the 'liberal' arts: Republicans paste tag on Democrats who prefer middle of road"&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Finkelstein worked against Dewhurst in the U.S. Senate primary, polling for the campaign of former ESPN broadcaster [[Craig James (American football)|Craig James]].&lt;ref&gt;Gromer Jeffers Jr., ''Dallas Morning News'', March 15, 2012, "Texas GOP candidates for U.S. Senate prepare for Thursday debate"&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein also served as pollster for the 2004 primary challenge by conservative Pennsylvania Congressman [[Pat Toomey]] against moderate incumbent Sen. [[Arlen Specter]],&lt;ref name="Roll Call 2010"&gt;''Roll Call'', April 29, 2010, "Wealthy Businessman Hires Media Recluse"&lt;/ref&gt; pairing with strategist Jon Lerner.&lt;ref name="Hagstrom, Jerry 2010"&gt;Hagstrom, Jerry, ''National Journal'', November 4, 2010, "The GOP's Smiling Consultants"&lt;/ref&gt; Specter averted defeat narrowly only after massive assistance from the NRSC and Bush White House (and then switched parties after the 2008 election); Toomey was elected to Specter's seat in 2010 and 2016.

In 2005, Finkelstein polled for the gubernatorial campaign of [[Doug Forrester]] in New Jersey; he was defeated by [[Jon Corzine]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Dan, ''Star-Ledger'', September 6, 2005, "NEW JERSEY -- GAME ON, GLOVES OFF"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Connie Mack IV]]'s 2007 marriage to Congresswoman [[Mary Bono]] led to Finkelstein's aiding her sharply contested (but successful) California campaign in November 2008, defeating Democrat Julie Bornstein in Obama's triumphant year.&lt;ref name="Roll Call 2010"/&gt; Bono finally lost in 2012, after her [[Riverside County]] seat was redistricted, falling to [[Raul Ruiz (politician)|Raul Ruiz]].&lt;ref&gt;''Desert Sun'', September 23, 2012, "Political Insider: Poll: Ruiz closing in on Bono Mack"&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein returned to New Hampshire in 2009-10, taking on the insurgent campaign of [[Bill Binnie]] for the GOP Senate nomination.&lt;ref name="Roll Call 2010"/&gt; Binnie was defeated by former Attorney General [[Kelly Ayotte]], who went on to election that November.

In May 2011, Finkelstein told an audience in Prague that three presidential candidates had asked him to serve as pollster on their campaign for the 2012 Republican nomination, and he had turned all three down. (He further noted that [[Ron Paul]] was not one of those three.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfCBpCBOECU|title=CEVRO Institut Forum / Arthur Finkelstein / English|first=|last=CEVROInstitut|date=April 8, 2012|accessdate=August 26, 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaign style and reviews ==
Finkelstein was known for his hard-edged political campaigns, which often focused on a single message with great repetition. He is credited with helping to make "[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]" a dirty word in the United States during the late 1980s and 1990s through the use of commercial messages such as this, intended to damage the image of [[Jack Reed (politician)|Jack Reed]]:

{{quote|That's liberal. That's Jack Reed. That's wrong. Call liberal Jack Reed and tell him his record on welfare is just too liberal for you.&lt;ref name="karl"&gt;{{cite news | first=Jonathan | last=Karl | url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/news/9610/10/karl.finkelstein/index.shtml | title=Arthur Finkelstein: Out Of Sight But In Control | work=Inside Politics | publisher=CNN | date=October 10, 1996 | accessdate=July 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While often successful (as with NCPAC's attacks on seemingly moderate Democrats, or the D'Amato and Pataki campaigns in New York), Finkelstein's tactics sometimes backfired – in 1996, his repeated attacks against [[Minnesota]] U.S. Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] (calling him "Embarrassingly liberal. Decades out of touch."&lt;ref name="dionne"&gt;{{cite news | first=E.J., Jr. | last=Dionne | url=http://www.wpyellowpages.com/wp-srv/politics/talk/zforum/wellstone/wellstone011997.htm | title=Radical Realist | work=The Washington Post | page=W08 | date=January 19, 1997 | accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) may have helped galvanize Wellstone's liberal grass-roots base. Republican Sen. [[Rod Grams]] eventually condemned Finkelstein's negative ads against Wellstone as excessive; however, his client (former Sen. [[Rudy Boschwitz]]) came closer that year than any GOP challenger to defeating a Democratic incumbent.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Senate elections, 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}

Finkelstein refused the notion he engaged in negative campaigning, a phrase he said connotes false accusations: "It just means that you speak about the failings of your opponent as opposed to the virtues of your candidate"—a strategy he called "rejectionist voting"—a formula based on slogans that disparaged adversaries.&lt;ref name="samroberts"/&gt;

[[Time magazine]] in October 1996 reported the Liberal-branding strategy was dubbed "Finkel-think" by leading [[Bob Dole]] advisers, and the presidential nominee was (belatedly) employing it against President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/analysis/time/9610/07/pooley.shtml|title=AllPolitics - TIME This Week: Oct. 07, 1996|website=Cnn.com|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist Darrell M. West, in 1996 said ". . .He uses a sledgehammer in every race ... I've detected five phrases he uses — ultraliberal, superliberal, embarrassingly liberal, foolishly liberal and unbelievably liberal."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Philip Friedman, a Manhattan consultant who got his start working for Finkelstein's frequent Democratic rival [[David Garth]], described the pollster as "the ultimate sort of [[Dr. Strangelove]], who believes you can largely disregard what the politicians are going to say and do, what the newspapers are going to do, and create a simple and clear and often negative message, which, repeated often enough, can bring you to victory".&lt;ref name="Purdum"/&gt;

Republican strategist [[Roger Ailes]], who worked with Finkelstein on numerous races in the 1980s, described "Art" as "a polling guy with creative talents",&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

John Fossel, chairman of Oppenheimer Funds, characterized him as "basically sort of a mad scientist". Finkelstein polled in Fossel's unsuccessful Republican Congressional campaign in Westchester County in 1982. "We had a knock-down, drag-out over whether busing was an issue in Westchester. His polls told him it was. I said, 'I don't think it is, but if it is, it isn't to me,' and we didn't use it."&lt;ref name="Purdum"/&gt;

[[Carter Wrenn]], who worked on Republican campaigns for 44 years with Finkelstein in North Carolina, called him "one of the most creative people I have ever worked with ... He is brilliant in terms of analyzing polls and numbers. He has a unique combination of an analytical and creative mind ... This guy's a workaholic. He must work 18 hours a day ... If you need him, he comes."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

[[Thomas F. Ellis|Tom Ellis]], cofounder of the [[National Congressional Club]] said "Just knock on his head, and he'll give you an idea."&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"/&gt;

In 1990, [[Randall Rothenberg]] of ''The New York Times'' documented the rise of political and other ads intended to create controversy (in and of themselves), as well as to persuade. While [[Roger Ailes]] was credited by some as pioneering the tactic, "other Washington political hands give credit to Finkelstein, another Republican consultant, who deployed numerous news-generating commercials in his 1982 work for the [[National Conservative Political Action Committee]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Randall, New Yoirk Times News Service, published in the Toronto Globe and Mail, January 9, 1990, "Controversial ads aimed at attracting news coverage"&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein's early style is described in an scholarly account of a Congressional primary race in Arizona, published in 1979 in the "[[Quarterly Journal of Speech]]".&lt;ref name="benson"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00335638109383581|last=Benson|first=Thomas W.|year=1981|title=Another Shooting in Cowtown|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=67|issue=4|pages=347–406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein gave advice to political candidates or elected officials to perform the "dance of the honest man", a metaphor for responding to "questions about transparency, honesty, or integrity" by imagining oneself as a typical, honest voter.&lt;ref name="politickernj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politickernj.com/jeffmichaels/28936/dance-honest-man|title=The Dance of the Honest Man|last=Michaels|first=Jeff|date=April 11, 2009|work=PolitickerNJ.com|accessdate=May 13, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517081608/http://www.politickernj.com/jeffmichaels/28936/dance-honest-man|archivedate=May 17, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' credited Finkelstein with using polling data to pinpoint the division of [[Jerusalem]] as an issue over which Israelis would reject a deal with the Palestinians, during the 1996 election in Israel. The newspaper attributed Benjamin Netanyahu's victory in part to Finkelstein's "scare-mongering".&lt;ref&gt;Colvile, Robert, The world is spinning on the hustlers' axis, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', August 16, 2008, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other businesses ==
Finkelstein's office shared a small building with Diversified Research, a separate but related firm that executes telephone surveys and packages their results for political and business consultants (including some media pollsters).&lt;ref name="Associated Press 1988"&gt;Associated Press,  October 27, 1988, "Presidential Dead Heat in New York"&lt;/ref&gt; The firm, long based in [[Irvington, New York]], had formerly been located in nearby [[Mount Kisco]].&lt;ref name="Lynn, Frank 1979"/&gt;

Finkelstein also had interests in Murphy-Powers Media Inc. (whimsically named for two young campaign-manager proteges),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.politicalresources.com/2013-02-19-22-18-56/directory/campaign-media-services/media-consultants/murphy-powers-media-inc&lt;/ref&gt; and Multi-Media Services (a media-buying firm helmed for years by [[Tony Fabrizio]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Matea, ''Los Angeles Times'', January 20, 2011, "Alexandria, Va., hosts a quiet hub of Republican power," accessed thru http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/20/nation/la-na-king-street-20110121/2&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Arthur's Kids" ==

==One World Trade Center inscription==
Finkelstein is also reportedly the author of the words inscribed on the cornerstone of [[One World Trade Center]] (otherwise called the Freedom Tower), completed in 2014. At the 2004 dedication, Gov. Pataki read aloud the inscription: "To honor and remember those who lost their lives on September 11th, 2001 and as a tribute to the enduring spirit of freedom—July Fourth, 2004."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panynj.gov/press-room/press-item.cfm?headLine_id=489|title=Press Release Article - Port Authority of NY &amp; NJ|website=Panynj.gov|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Finkelstein was hired by the ''[[New York Post]]'' to do polling in the hotly contested Democratic presidential primary,&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, Andrew, Behind the Forecasts of a Close Race: Why Some Are Off the Mark, ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 21, 1988, pg. D-25.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the surprisingly close presidential race in the state that fall.&lt;ref name="Associated Press 1988"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1996, ''[[Boston Magazine]]'' [[outing|outed]] Finkelstein as a homosexual in a feature story. In April 2005, Finkelstein acknowledged that in December 2004, he had married his partner of forty years in a civil ceremony at his home in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="nagourney"&gt;{{cite news | first=Adam | last=Nagourney | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/09/politics/09finkelstein.html | title=G.O.P.

Finkelstein was a self-identified [[libertarianism|libertarian]] conservative. (He once did polling work for the Free Libertarian Party.)&lt;ref name="Lynn, Frank 1979"/&gt; In his final years he increasingly distanced himself personally from [[social conservatism|social conservative]] elements within the Republican Party (while nevertheless still working for many conservative candidates).&lt;ref name="nagourney" /&gt;  In a 1979 interview, he denied he was "a hard-core right-winger," but noted there was hardly "a serious conservative over the last 10 years [i.e. 1969-79] whom I haven't been involved with."&lt;ref name="Lynn, Frank 1979"/&gt;

Finkelstein died of lung cancer on August 18, 2017, aged 72, in [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arthur Finklestein, master campaign strategist, dies at 72|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/arthur-finklestein-master-campaign-strategist-dies-at-72/|accessdate=August 19, 2017|work=Times of Israel|date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schudel|first1=Matt|title=Arthur Finkelstein, quietly influential GOP campaign mastermind, dies at 72|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/arthur-finkelstein-shadowy-campaign-mastermind-and-gop-operative-dies-at-72/2017/08/19/0bd638c6-84e8-11e7-902a-2a9f2d808496_story.html|accessdate=August 19, 2017|work=Washington Post|date=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Survivors included his husband, Donald Curiale, of Ipswich and Fort Lauderdale; two daughters, Jennifer Delgado of Danvers, Mass., Molly Finkelstein of Alpharetta, Ga.; two brothers; and a granddaughter Maryn BairdKelly.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

* "Stupid people say stupid things." ([[Hebrew language]] paper [[Maariv]] in 1999)
* "I have been criticized for 20 years for running ideologically arched campaigns.  I plead guilty. I will continue to run ideologically arched campaigns as long as there are more conservatives than there are liberals, rather than more Democrats than there are Republicans." (Speech to Conservative Political Action Conference, 1991)&lt;ref name="samroberts"/&gt;
* Finkelstein insisted he never lied -- "I do not slander somebody without proof."&lt;ref name="samroberts"/&gt;
* "In politics, it's what you perceive to be true that's true, not truth.  If I tell you one thing is true, you will believe the second thing is true.  A good politician will tell you a few things that are true before he will tell you a few things that are untrue, because you will then believe all the things he has said, true and untrue."

* "The political center has disappeared, and the Republican Party has become the party of the Christian right more so than in any other period in modern history ...

* "I think I'm the playwright or the director, and not the actor. And the actors need to be onstage, not the director. And I think it's absurd that people who do what I do become as important, as celebrated, as the ones who are running."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* Speaking to GOP congressional hopefuls in 1978: "If any of you do get elected, and chances are 19-to-1 you won't ... don't run your own campaign; don't let your spouse do it; and don't listen to the nice lady who praises the brilliance of your speech—she probably was the only one in the audience who thought so." He said [[Proposition 13]] (just passed in California) shouldn't be interpreted as "evidence people want services cut. They want taxes cut," and voters aren't sophisticated enough to understand that one leads to the other.&lt;ref name="Baker, Donald P. 1978"&gt;Baker, Donald P., "GOP 'Pupils' Learn Humility; Workshop for Congressional Hopefuls" ''[[The Washington Post]]'', June 20, 1978, C1&lt;/ref&gt;
* He cited the 1965 New York mayoral campaign of [[John Lindsay]], elected because "he promised to cut the budget in half and double the services. Four years later, when it was apparent that he had doubled the budget and cut services; Lindsay said, 'Yes, I made a mistake,' but he was re-elected when he promised to help end the Vietnam War."&lt;ref name="Baker, Donald P. 1978"/&gt;
* Said in 1979 that there are three kinds of candidates' wives—the wife "who hates politics and refuses to come out of the house," the wife who is reluctant but "will do what she is asked," and the wife "who wants to be the candidate and loves politics more than her husband does." He put [[Rosalynn Carter]] and Arlene (Mrs. Phil) Crane in the last category.&lt;ref name="Lynn, Frank 1979"/&gt;
* After being praised for his winning advice in a Nassau County election: "I'm a hero, but the first time a town clerk loses an election after my figures show him winning, I will be over the hill and a bum."&lt;ref name="Lynn, Frank 1979"/&gt;
* Longtime associate George Birnbaum: "I would always say, 'Arthur, do you realize how much we're changing history?' He would say, 'I don't know how much we're changing history; we're touching history."&lt;ref name="samroberts"/&gt;

She is a widely read and award-winning [[columnist]] and [[essayist]], and author of 21 books. Ehrenreich is perhaps best known for her 2001 book ''[[Nickel and Dimed|Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America]]''. A memoir of Ehrenreich's three-month experiment surviving on [[minimum wage]] as a waitress, hotel maid, house cleaner, nursing-home aide, and [[Wal-Mart]] clerk, it was described by ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine as "jarring" and "full of riveting grit,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meadows|first=Susannah|title=A Working Knowledge|newspaper=Newsweek|date=4 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' as an "exposé" putting "human flesh on the bones of such abstractions as 'living wage' and 'affordable housing'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2001/05/28/010528crbn_brieflynoted2|accessdate=9 May 2011|newspaper=New Yorker|date=28 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Ehrenreich was born '''Barbara Alexander''' to Isabelle Oxley and Ben Howes Alexander in [[Butte, Montana|Butte]], Montana, which she describes as then being "a bustling, brawling, blue collar mining town."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ehrenreich |first=Barbara |title=About Barbara |url=http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com/barbara_ehrenreich.htm |accessdate=8 May 2011 |newspaper=barbaraehrenreich.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623005647/http://barbaraehrenreich.com/barbara_ehrenreich.htm |archivedate=23 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on [[C-SPAN]], she characterized her parents as "strong union people" with two family rules: "never [[Strikebreaker|cross a picket line]] and never vote Republican."&lt;ref name=booknotes/&gt; In a talk she gave in 1999, Ehrenreich called herself a "fourth-generation atheist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|title=My Family Values Atheism: Acceptance speech upon receiving the 1999 Freethought Heroine Award|url=http://www.ffrf.org/legacy/fttoday/2000/april2000/ehrenreich.html|publisher=Freedom From Religion Foundation|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"As a little girl," she told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1993, "I would go to school and have to decide if my parents were the evil people they were talking about, part of the Red Menace we read about in the Weekly Reader, just because my mother was a liberal Democrat who would always talk about racial injustice."&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Ivana|title=Barbara Ehrenreich's Writing Attracts an Attentive Audience|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/17/nyregion/barbara-ehrenreich-s-writing-attracts-an-attentive-audience.html?pagewanted=2|accessdate=8 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a [[copper mining|copper miner]] who went to the [[Montana Tech of the University of Montana|Montana School of Mines]] (now Montana Tech&lt;ref&gt;https://mtech.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;), and then to [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. He eventually became a senior executive at the [[Gillette Corporation]]. Her parents later divorced.

Ehrenreich studied [[chemistry]] at [[Reed College]], graduating in 1963. Her senior thesis was entitled ''Electrochemical oscillations of the silicon anode''. In 1968, she received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in [[Immunology|cellular immunology]] from [[Rockefeller University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=http://vimeo.com/channels/theschooloflife#10454695|title=The School of Life|publisher=|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Ehrenreich gave birth to her daughter [[Rosa Brooks]] in a public clinic in New York. "I was the only white patient at the clinic," she told ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' newspaper in 1987. "They induced my labor because it was late in the evening and the doctor wanted to go home. I was enraged. The experience made me a feminist."&lt;ref name="Sherman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherman|first=Scott|title=Class Warrior: Barbara Ehrenreich's Singular Crusade|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/DemocraticLeft/message/11149|accessdate=9 May 2011|newspaper=Columbia Journalism Review|date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

After completing her doctorate, Ehrenreich did not pursue a career in science. Instead, she worked first as an analyst with the [[Bureau of the Budget]] in New York City and with the [[Health Policy Advisory Center]], and later as an assistant professor at the [[State University of New York at Old Westbury]]. In 1972, Ehrenreich began co-teaching a course on women and health with feminist journalist and academic [[Deirdre English]]. Through the rest of the seventies, Ehrenreich worked mostly in health-related research, advocacy and activism, including co-writing, with English, several feminist books and pamphlets on the history and politics of women's health. During this period she began speaking frequently at conferences staged by women's health centers and women's groups, by universities, and by the United States government. She also spoke regularly about [[socialist feminism]] and about feminism in general.&lt;ref name="oasis.lib.harvard.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Papers of Barbara Ehrenreich, 1922-2007 (inclusive), 1963-2007 (bulk): A Finding Aid|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch01203|publisher=Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University|accessdate=8 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216220246/http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch01203|archive-date=2011-12-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1979 and 1981, she served as an adjunct associate professor at [[New York University]] and as a visiting professor at the [[University of Missouri]] at Columbia and at [[Sangamon State University]]. She lectured at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], was a writer-in-residence at the [[Ohio State University]], [[Wayne Morse]] chair at the [[University of Oregon]], and a teaching fellow at the graduate school of journalism at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. She has been a fellow at the [[New York Institute for the Humanities]], the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]], the [[Institute for Policy Studies]], and the New York-based Society of American Historians.&lt;ref name="oasis.lib.harvard.edu"/&gt;

In 2006, Ehrenreich founded United Professionals, an organization described as "a nonprofit,  non-partisan membership organization for [[white-collar worker]]s, regardless of profession or employment status. We reach out to all unemployed, underemployed, and anxiously employed workers—people who bought the American dream that education and credentials could lead to a secure middle class life, but now find their lives disrupted by forces beyond their control."&lt;ref&gt;

In 1980, Ehrenreich shared the [[National Magazine Award]] for excellence in reporting with colleagues at [[Mother Jones magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Magazine Awards Database of Past Winners and Finalists|url=http://www.magazine.org/asme/magazine_awards/searchable_database/index.aspx|publisher=American Society of Magazine Editors|accessdate=8 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110526232156/http://www.magazine.org/asme/magazine_awards/searchable_database/index.aspx| archivedate= 26 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the cover story ''The Corporate Crime of the Century'',&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Columnist Biography: Barbara Ehrenreich|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/opinion/ehrenreich-bio.html|accessdate=8 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; about "what happens after the U.S. government forces a dangerous drug, pesticide or other product off the domestic market, then the manufacturer sells that same product, frequently with the direct support of the State Department, throughout the rest of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dowie|first=Mark|title=The Corporate Crime of the Century|url=http://motherjones.com/toc/1979/11/table-contents|accessdate=8 May 2011|newspaper=Mother Jones|year=1979|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006204928/https://www.motherjones.com/toc/1979/11/table-contents|archivedate=6 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the [[American Humanist Association]] named her "Humanist of the Year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist of the Year|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_the_AHA/Humanists_of_the_Year|publisher=American Humanist Association|accessdate=8 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110522103346/http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_the_AHA/Humanists_of_the_Year| archivedate= 22 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, she won a National Magazine Award for her essay "Welcome to Cancerland: A mammogram leads to a cult of pink kitsch," which describes Ehrenreich's own experience of being diagnosed with breast cancer, and describes what she calls the "breast cancer cult," which "serves as an accomplice in global poisoning -- normalizing cancer, prettying it up, even presenting it, perversely, as a positive and enviable experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harper's Magazine Awards and Honors|url=http://www.harpers.org/advertising/pdfs-2008-10/Harpers_Magazine_AwardsAndHonors.pdf|publisher=Harper's Magazine|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ehrenreich |first=Barbara |title=Welcome To Cancerland |url=http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com/cancerland.htm |accessdate=8 May 2011 |newspaper=Harper's Magazine |date=November 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609202708/http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com/cancerland.htm |archivedate=9 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, Ehrenreich received the prestigious [[Erasmus Prize]] by King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]] for her work in investigative journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.erasmusprijs.org/Nieuws?mode=detail&amp;item=Press+release+2018+Erasmus+Prize+awarded+to+Barbara+Ehrenreich&amp;lang=en|title=Press release: 2018 Erasmus Prize awarded to Barbara Ehrenreich|last=|first=|date=2018-03-01|website=www.erasmusprijs.org|publisher=Stichting Praemium Erasmianum|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and family==

Ehrenreich has one brother, Ben Alexander Jr., and one sister, Diane Alexander.

When Ehrenreich was 35, according to the book ''Always Too Soon: Voices of Support for Those Who Have Lost Both Parents'', her mother died "from a likely suicide."&lt;ref name="Edited by Allison Gilbert and Christina Baker Kline 2006 269"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edited by Allison Gilbert and Christina Baker Kline|title=Always Too Soon: Voices of Support for Those Who Have Lost Both Parents|year=2006|publisher=Seal Press|pages=269|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygkEWnnIrpkC&amp;lpg=PA269&amp;dq=%22always%20too%20soon%22%20barbara%20ehrenreich&amp;pg=PA269#v=onepage&amp;q=%22always%20too%20soon%22%20barbara%20ehrenreich&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father died years later from Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name="Edited by Allison Gilbert and Christina Baker Kline 2006 269"/&gt;

She has been married and divorced twice. She met her first husband, [[John Ehrenreich]], during an [[Peace movement|anti-war activism]] campaign in [[New York City]], and they married in 1966. He is a clinical psychologist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bitters and Cream (personal site)|url=http://www.bittersandcream.com/index.php?p=1_4_About-Me|publisher=John Ehrenreich|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they co-wrote several books about health policy and labor issues before divorcing in 1977. In 1983, she married Gary Stevenson, a [[trade union|union]] organizer for the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]].&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt; She divorced Stevenson in 1993.&lt;ref name="oasis.lib.harvard.edu"/&gt;

Ehrenreich has two children. Born in 1970, her daughter [[Rosa Brooks|Rosa]] was named after [[Rosa Parks]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], and a great-grandmother.&lt;ref name="Sherman"/&gt; She is a Virginia-based law professor, national security and foreign policy expert and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/author/RosaBrooks|title=Foreign Policy - the Global Magazine of News and Ideas|publisher=|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in 1972, her son [[Ben Ehrenreich|Ben]] is a journalist and novelist in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ben-ehrenreich-david-grann-new-yorker-gq-atlantic-2011-5|title=Meet The Los Angeles Writer Who Beat The New Yorker, GQ, And The Atlantic|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-03-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filling in for a vacationing [[Thomas Friedman]] as a columnist with ''The New York Times'' in 2004, Ehrenreich wrote about how, in the fight for women's reproductive rights, "it's the women who shrink from acknowledging their own abortions who really irk me," and said that she herself "had two abortions during my all-too-fertile years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|title=Owning Up To Abortion|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/22/opinion/owning-up-to-abortion.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=9 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1990 book of essays ''The Worst Years of Our Lives'', she wrote that "the one regret I have about my own abortions is that they cost money that might otherwise have been spent on something more pleasurable, like taking the kids to movies and theme parks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Robert|title=The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations|year=1993|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cl5c4T9LWkC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22The%20one%20regret%20I%20have%20about%20my%20own%20abortions%20is%20that%20they%20cost%20money%20that%20might%20otherwise%20have%20been%20spent%20on%20something%20more%20pleasurable%2C%20like%20taking%20the%20kids%20to%20movies%20and%20theme%20parks.%22&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20one%20regret%20I%20have%20about%20my%20own%20abortions%20is%20that%20they%20cost%20money%20that%20might%20otherwise%20have%20been%20spent%20on%20something%20more%20pleasurable,%20like%20taking%20the%20kids%20to%20movies%20and%20theme%20parks.%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ehrenreich was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] shortly after the release of her book ''[[Nickel and Dimed|Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America]]''. This resulted in the award-winning article "Welcome to Cancerland," published in the November 2001 issue of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''. The article inspired the 2011 documentary ''[[Pink Ribbons, Inc.]]''.&lt;ref name=ctvcp&gt;{{cite news|last=Szklarski|first=Cassandra|title=NFB doc examines the politics of marketing disease|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20120131/nfb-breast-cancer-documentary-120131/|accessdate=31 January 2012|newspaper=[[CTV News]]|date=31 January 2012|agency=[[Canadian Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Ehrenreich endorsed the [[Ralph Nader presidential campaign, 2000|Presidential campaign of Ralph Nader]]; in 2004, she urged voters to support [[John Kerry]] in the [[swing states]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/news2004/0914-20.htm Nader's Top Endorsers From 2000 Urge "Swing States" Support for Kerry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111708/http://www.commondreams.org/news2004/0914-20.htm |date=2016-03-04 }}, [[Common Dreams]], Sept. 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2008, Ehrenreich expressed support for Senator [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehrenreich.blogs.com/barbaras_blog/2008/02/unstoppable-oba.html "Unstoppable Obama"] February 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">Lieutenant General '''Bazilio Olara-Okello''' (1929 &amp;ndash; 9 January 1990) was a [[Uganda]]n [[Officer (armed forces)|military officer]] and one of the [[commander]]s of the [[Uganda National Liberation Army]] (UNLA) that together with the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force|Tanzanian army]] overthrew [[Idi Amin]] in 1979. In 1985, he was briefly the chairman of the ruling Military Council and ''de facto'' [[President of Uganda|head of state of Uganda]], and later, [[Lieutenant General]] and chief of the armed forces.

During the [[Ugandan Bush War|civil war in Uganda]] between the UNLA (which was now the national army) and [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s [[National Resistance Army]], president [[Milton Obote]] alienated much of the [[Acholi]]-dominated officer corps, including Olara-Okello and General [[Tito Okello]], by appointing his fellow ethnic [[Langi people|Lango]], Brigadier Smith Opon Acak, as army Chief of Staff. On 27 July 1985, an army brigade of the UNLA commanded by Olara-Okello, and composed mostly of [[Acholi]] troops, staged a [[coup d'état]] against [[Milton Obote]]'s government and seized power. The [[National Assembly of Uganda|National Assembly]] was dissolved and a Military Council was established. Between 27 and 29 July 1985, Olara-Okello was Chairman of the Military Council, and ''de facto'' head of state.

On 29 July, General [[Tito Okello]] replaced Olara-Okello as Chairman of the Military Council, and Olara-Okello was promoted from the rank of [[Brigadier]] to that of [[Lieutenant General]], and named chief of the armed forces. He commanded the army until [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s [[National Resistance Army]] seized power on 26 January 1986. Olara-Okello fled to exile in [[Sudan]], where he lived until he died in [[Omdurman]] Hospital in [[Khartoum]] on 9 January 1990.

'''Belarusians''' ({{lang-be|беларусы|biełarusy}}) are an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] [[ethnic group]] who are native to modern-day [[Belarus]] and the immediate region. There are over 9.5 million people who proclaim Belarusian ethnicity worldwide, with the majority residing either in Belarus or the adjacent countries where they are an autochthonous minority.

Belarusians are an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] [[ethnic group]] who populate the majority of the [[Belarus]]. Belarusian minority populations live in countries neighboring Belarus: in Ukraine, in Poland (especially in the [[Podlaskie Voivodeship]]), in the Russian Federation and in Lithuania. At the beginning of the 20th century Belarusians constituted a minority in the regions around the city of [[Smolensk]] in Russia.

Significant numbers of Belarusians emigrated to the United States, Brazil and Canada in the early 20th century. During Soviet times (1917–1991), many Belarusians were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported or migrated]] to various regions of the USSR, including [[Siberia]], Kazakhstan and Ukraine.

Since the breakup of the [[USSR]] in 1991 several hundred thousand have emigrated to the [[Baltic states]], the United States, Canada, Russia, and [[European Union|EU countries]].

==Languages==
The two official languages in Belarus are [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and Russian. Russian is the most spoken language, principally by 72% of the population, while Belarusian is only used by 11.9%&lt;ref name="belta.by"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belta.by/ru/news/society?id=422619|title=Общество|website=Belta.by|accessdate=18 March 2015}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in everyday life. According to a study, in varying degrees, the vast majority of residents speak the Belarusian language: 29.4% are fluent, being able read and write it, 52.5% can speak and read the language, 8.3% can understand it but can't speak or read it, while a further 7% are able to understand the parts of Belarusian language that are similar to Russian.&lt;ref name="belta.by"/&gt;  Belarusian is a language of the [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic group]].

The name ''Belarus'' can be literally translated as ''[[White Ruthenia]]'' that is a historical region in the east of modern Republic of Belarus, known in Latin as ''Ruthenia Alba'' ({{lang-en|White Rus}}). This name was in use in the West for some time in history, together with ''White Ruthenes''. Belarusians trace their name back to the people of [[Rus' people|Rus']].

The term Belarusians was promoted mostly during the 19th century by the [[Russian Empire]]. For instance, this can be traced by editions of folklorist researches by [[Ivan Sakharov]], where in the edition of 1836 Belarusian customs are described as ''Litvin'', while in the edition of 1886 the words Литва (''Lithuania'') are replaced by respectively Беларусь (''Belarus'') and беларусы (''Belarusians'').

==History==
[[File:Baltic Tribes c 1200.svg|thumb|right|Baltic population in the 12th century]]
The Belarusian people trace their distinct culture to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], earlier [[Kievan Rus]] and the [[Principality of Polatsk]]. Most Belarusians are descendants of the East Slav tribes [[Dregovichs]], [[Krivichs]] and [[Radimich]]s, as well as of a [[Balts|Baltic tribe]] of [[Yotvingians]] who lived in the west and north-west of today's Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/istoriya/BELORUSI.html|title=БЕЛОРУСЫ                                                                                             - Энциклопедия Кругосвет|website=Krugosvet.ru|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belarusians began to emerge as a people during the thirteenth through fourteenth centuries in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Mostly on the lands of the upper basins of [[Neman River]], [[Dnieper River]] and the [[Daugava River|Western Dvina River]].&lt;ref&gt;Беларусы : у 10 т. / Рэдкал.: В. К. Бандарчык [і інш.]. — Мінск : Беларус. навука, 1994–2007. — Т. 4 : Вытокі і этнічнае развіццё... С. 36, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 13th–18th centuries Belarusians were known as ''[[Ruthenians]]'' and spoke [[Ruthenian language]], while being part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], which conquered the lands of [[White Ruthenia]], [[Black Ruthenia]] and [[Polesia]]. [[Casimir's Code]] of 1468 and all three editions of [[Statutes of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (1529, 1566, and 1588) were written in the Ruthenian language. From the 1630s it was replaced by [[Polish language|Polish]], as a result of [[Poles|Polish]] high culture acquiring increasing prestige in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

Between 1791 and 1917 much of Belarus, with its Christian and Jewish populations, was acquired by the [[Russian Empire]] in a series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers, and was made part of a region known as the [[Pale of Settlement]].

After World War I Belarusians created their own national state, with varying degrees of independence – first as the short-lived [[Belarusian National Republic]] under German occupation, then as the [[Belarusian SSR]] from 1919 until 1991, which merged with other republics to become a constituent member of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922. Belarus gained full independence with the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982-91)|dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.

'''Beth Clement'''&lt;!-- we don't have a reliable source for whether this is short for Elizabeth or Bethany, so please don't add it unless you also provide such a source--&gt; is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[Channel 4]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by [[Sinéad Moynihan]]. Beth first appeared as a student at [[Hollyoaks Community College]], studying for a nursing degree and was later involved in an [[accidental incest]] storyline with her half-brother, [[Rhys Ashworth]] ([[Andrew Moss]]). Beth died in a [[Traffic collision|car accident]] on 18 April 2008.

==Character creation==
The character of Beth was introduced in November 2007, played by [[Sinéad Moynihan]], as a love interest for established character [[Rhys Ashworth]] ([[Andrew Moss]]).&lt;ref name="sinead"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a71695/sexy-chicks-secret-past-to-rock-hollyoaks.html |title=Sexy chick's secret past to rock Hollyoaks |work=Digital Spy |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Kris |last=Green |date=14 August 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed that the character would discover she is the half-sister of Rhys, starting an incestuous relationship.

Speaking of her character, Moynihan said: "I'm thrilled to be joining the cast of ''Hollyoaks'' and to be playing the character of enigmatic rock chick Beth. She's a quick-witted and independent young woman who loves indie and rock music as well as having a real lust for life." She continued, "Beth's got some great storylines lined up and I'm looking forward to the viewers' reactions as both her character and relationship with Rhys develops."&lt;ref name="sinead"/&gt; A Channel 4 spokesperson also commented on Beth's upcoming storyline, saying: "Beth's going to be central to a massive autumn storyline for Hollyoaks which will turn certain characters' worlds upside down."&lt;ref name="sinead"/&gt;

==Storylines==
Beth first appears when she is run over by [[Rhys Ashworth]] whilst they are both on their way to purchase tickets to see a band. Beth is not injured, but discovers Rhys has bought the last tickets for himself. Rhys gives Beth a ticket, which belonged to his friend [[Gilly Roach]]. The pair swap numbers and begin to date. They quickly fall for each other. Rhys's family does not believe him when he tells them he has found a girlfriend. However, Beth begins to avoid Rhys. Unknown to Rhys, this is because her father has died. Rhys's father [[Noel Ashworth]] dies and Rhys attends the wake. Noel's brother [[Neville Ashworth|Neville]] then introduces Rhys to Noel's daughter, Beth. Rhys and Beth avoid each other, and Rhys is angry, believing Beth had known all along that they were half siblings. He then tells her that he never wants to see her again. However, Beth soon begins at Hollyoaks Community College, despite applying for a transfer. Beth befriends fellow students, [[Zoe Carpenter]] and [[Kris Fisher]], giving her a reason to stay in the village. Slowly, Rhys and Beth resolve their differences as Beth moves in with the Ashworths. The family throw her a birthday party to make her feel welcome. She becomes friends with her cousin [[Hannah Ashworth]] and they go on a double date with Gilly and [[Danny Valentine]]. Beth and Gilly eventually kiss and become a couple, which makes Rhys jealous. After months of hiding their feelings, Rhys and Beth give in. However, they both try to forget about it the next day. Gilly then takes Beth on a trip to [[Thailand]]. Before they leave, Beth and Rhys admit their love for each other, despite knowing it is illegal.

Beth and Gilly return from Thailand and are surprised to see Rhys has a new girlfriend, [[Mercedes McQueen]]. The following day, Rhys warns Beth that Gilly is planning to propose marriage to her. When Gilly proposes, Beth reluctantly agrees, despite continuing an affair with Rhys. Rhys and Beth decide to run away together, but Rhys realises his family need him. Beth becomes even more jealous of Rhys and Mercedes' relationship. Eventually Beth breaks down in front of Rhys, telling him she wants to be with him. As they kiss, they are both unaware that Mercedes' sister, [[Michaela McQueen]] is watching. Michaela confronts them. However, they tell her it is due to her drug habit. Angered, Michaela tells Gilly what she saw. However, he refuses to believe her. Despite this, he returns home, only to find Rhys and Beth in bed together. As the rest of the Ashworths return home, Gilly attacks Rhys and informs his family of his affair. Neville, [[Suzanne Ashworth|Suzanne]], [[Josh Ashworth|Josh]] and Hannah are disgusted. Rhys and Beth are then thrown out of their home, having to move into the student accommodation. Beth and Rhys are questioned by the police and a court date is set. Realising they face prison, the couple decide to flee Hollyoaks. Gilly confronts them, before giving them the keys to his campervan. Rhys and Beth drive off. However, as they kiss, Rhys unknowingly drives onto the wrong side of the road and ends up in a collision with a lorry. Rhys wakes up in hospital the next day. However, he is told Beth was killed in the crash.

'''Charles Burt''' was a Scottish artist known for line engraving.

==Life== 
He was born in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]], 8 Nov 1823(?) to Charles and Jessie (Kennedy) Burt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Cyclopedia of American Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gawYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA386 |publisher=J.T.White, US, 1904|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed a gift for drawing at a young age. At the age of 17 he won the student contest for best drawing of the Eddystone lighthouse, drawn from a verbal description: this work was apparently hanging in the halls of Edinburgh high school for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Cyclopedia of American Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gawYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA386 |publisher=J.T.White, 1904|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still in Scotland, he was apprenticed to William Home Lizars. He emigrated to [[New York City]] in 1836, and went to work for Alexander L. Dick. Under his employ, Burt illustrated many books and engraved a number of portraits. Most of this work during this time is untraceable, as it was all published under Dick's name. It is widely assumed that the engraving of Leonardo's Last Supper is Burt's handiwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barnaby|first1=Paul|title=The Walter Scott Digital Archive|url=http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/portraits/engravers/burt.html|website=The Walter Scott Digital Archive|publisher=Edinburgh University Library|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leonardo's Last Supper.jpeg|thumbnail|This engraving, printed by Alexander L. Dick is widely believed to be the work of Charles Burt.]]

[[File:The Signing of the Death Warrant for Lady Jane Grey.jpg|thumbnail|The Signing of the Death Warrant for Lady Jane Grey, 1848.]]

As a member of the [[American Art Union]], Burt engraved several signed larger plates including: Sir Walter Raleigh Parting with his Wife (after Emanuel Leutze -1846); The Signing of the Death Warrant of Lady Jane Grey (after Daniel Huntington -1848); Anne Page, Slender, and Shallow (after Charles Robert Leslie -1850); Bargaining for a Horse (after William Sidney Mount -1851), and Marion Crossing the Pedee (after William Tylee Ranney -1851).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burt|first1=Alice|title=Catalogue of Line Engravings, Etchings and Original Drawings by Charles Burt, dec'd.|date=1 April 1893|publisher=Burt Estate|location=Brooklyn, NY|url=https://archive.org/details/catalogueoflinee00burt|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anne Page, Slender and Shallow.jpg|thumbnail|Anne Page, Slender and Shallow. 1850.]]

However, it was as one of the principal engravers for the US Treasury Department, that Burt is most remembered. He engraved Lincoln's portrait for the $100 bill In 1869. (This image remained on other large notes until 1928 when currency was reduced to the smaller size in use today: Lincoln's portrait remained on the $5 bill until 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moneyfactory.gov/wcflincolnexhibitcase1.html|website=US Department of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing|publisher=US Gov.|accessdate=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027025036/http://moneyfactory.gov/wcflincolnexhibitcase1.html|archivedate=27 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1850, Burt's focus was mainly on banknote engraving, which he was to do for over thirty years on behalf of the U.S. Treasury. He also engraved plates for postage stamps for Canada, Brazil, Italy, Russia and Chile, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Cyclopedia of American Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gawYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA386 |publisher=J.T.White, 1904|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincoln's face on the $5 bill.jpg|thumbnail|Burt engraved Lincoln's face for the $100 bill - later used on the $5.]]

Charles Burt was married on 3 June 1844 in Rockaway, NJ, to Margaret, daughter of Thomas Sargeant (of Parsipanny, NJ.). He lived most of his life in Brooklyn NY and died there on 25 March 1892. He was survived by his wife, one son and seven daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Cyclopedia of American Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gawYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA386 |publisher=J.T.White, 1904|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copenhagen Suborbitals''' is the world's only manned, amateur, crowd funded space programme. Since its beginning in 2008, Copenhagen Suborbitals has flown five home built rockets and two mock-up space capsules. Their stated goal is to have one of the members fly into space (above 100&amp;nbsp;km), on a [[sub-orbital spaceflight]], in a space capsule on the Spica rocket. The company is planning to launch its Nexø II rocket in summer 2018.

As an amateur organisation, the 55 members use their spare time on the project, while at the same time having regular dayjobs. At the annual general assembly, they elect a chairman and boardmembers. Currently (2017), the chairman is Kristian Elof Sørensen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://copenhagensuborbitals.com/mission/the-team/|title=The Team - Copenhagen Suborbitals|work=Copenhagen Suborbitals|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also leads the Copenhagen Suborbitals maritime group.

==Astronauts==

As of 2017, three members are candidates for becoming the first astronaut to fly on the Spica rocket:
* Mads Stenfatt
* Anna Olsen
* Carsten Olsen (father of Anna Olsen)

==Crowd funding==

Funding comes from people all over the world donating to the project, many of them on a monthly basis as members of Copenhagen Suborbitals Support. This is augmented by fees from speeches and lectures done by group members. Also, in 2015 Copenhagen Suborbitals taught students from the National Technical University of Singapore in basic rocket design, for which the group received a fee. All income goes directly to the group's project, with all members working completely for free.

==Sea launch==
[[File:TPE IMG 3516.jpg|thumb|The floating launch platform ''MLP Sputnik'' with HEAT 1X Tycho Brahe, photographed June 2011]]
[[Image:Vostok011.jpg|thumb|right|M/S Vostok in 2012.]]
A unique aspect of the project is that all rockets are launched at sea. As a non-governmental, non-commercial organisation, flying rockets from land is virtually impossible anywhere in the world. Therefore, the group conducts all flights from a mobile launch platform, MLP Sputnik, in international waters on the [[Baltic Sea]], east of the [[Denmark|Danish]] island [[Bornholm]]. The port of [[Nexø]] becomes the Copenhagen Suborbitals fleet's homeport during the summer launch missions, affectionately dubbed Spaceport Nexø. The group operates 3 ships:
* MLP Sputnik: A twin-hull, selfpropelled mobile, launch platform that has carried all the group's rockets and space capsules since 2010. Owned by Copenhagen Suborbitals.
* M/S Vostok. Originally built as a rescue vessel for the German Coast Guard, she's the command ship during launch and recovery, acting as flagship of the mission fleet. Owned by Copenhagen Suborbitals.
* M/S Antares. Support ship. Owned by Copenhagen Suborbitals member Carsten Olsen
During missions, the three vessels are augmented by multiple ships (often including the patrol vessel MHV903 Hjortø from the [[Home Guard (Denmark)|Danish Naval Home Guard]]), boats and aircraft. When not deployed, Vostok and Sputnik are based at Copenhagen Suborbitals HQ in the port of [[Copenhagen]].

==History==
[[File:CopenhagenSuborbitalCrew.jpg|thumb|right|The crew gathered in front of the static rocket test setup in November 2011]]
Copenhagen Suborbitals was founded in 2008 by [[Kristian von Bengtson]] and now-disgraced [[Peter Madsen (inventor)|Peter Madsen]] (who was later convicted of [[Murder of Kim Wall|murdering Kim Wall]]) as a non-profit, crowd funded project where important aspects of the operation were described in detail on blogs&lt;ref name=Wired_blog&gt;{{cite news|title=ROCKET SHOP|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/rocketshop|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rumfart på den anden måde|url=http://ing.dk/blogs/rumfartpaadenandenmaade|publisher=ing.dk|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TEDxCopenhagen - Kristian von Bengtson - Danes in space|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua9oGxNNGd0|publisher=TED X|accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 February 2014 the board of Copenhagen Suborbitals announced that Kristian von Bengtson had left the group, after falling out with Madsen. In June 2014 Madsen also left the group, after years of disagreement with the other members of the group. Since then Madsen has had no connection with Copenhagen Suborbitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://copenhagensuborbitals.com/statement-former-copenhagen-suborbitals-member-peter-madsen/|title=Our statement on former Copenhagen Suborbitals member Peter Madsen – Copenhagen Suborbitals|website=copenhagensuborbitals.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suborbital space flight profile==

[[File:Flightpath02.jpg|right|thumb|Drawing of the flight path]]
From the launch site on the Baltic Sea, the Spica rocket will carry the Spica capsule and the astronaut into space above 100&amp;nbsp;km. The capsule will separate and fall back to earth, where it will be decelerated by a [[ballute]] and [[parachute]]s, and land back in the Baltic Sea.

==Facilities==

[[File:Copenhagen Suborbitals Hangar 02-13-2010.jpg|thumb|Interior of the HAB building]]
CS started on a barge called M/S Half Machine in [[Port of Copenhagen]]. On 1 August 2009 they relocated to its base and office on [[Refshaleøen]], the old [[Burmeister &amp; Wain]] shipyard, in [[Copenhagen]]. Their workshop is dubbed HAB 2 ("Horizontal Assembly Building" as a reference to NASA's VAB).

==Rockets and engines==

===Spica===
In 2014, Copenhagen Suborbitals settled on the basic design for their first crewed rocket and space capsule. The rocket will be named Spica, and will stand 12–14 m tall with a diameter of 950&amp;nbsp;mm. It will be powered by the BPM-100 engine class, using liquid oxygen as oxidizer and ethanol as fuel, producing 100 kilonewtons of thrust. It's likely to feature pressure blow down tanks, optimised by a dynamic pressure regulation (DPR) system, but turbo pumps are also a possibility, albeit they are very difficult to build. Flight control will be thrust vectoring via a gimbal engine. The rocket will be fully guided by homebuilt electronics and software. Most of the systems and technology will initially be tested on the smaller Nexø class rockets in 2016/18. The space capsule will be of a tubular design as its predecessor Tycho Brahe, but its greater diameter will allow the astronaut to assume a sitting position during launch and re-entry, in order to withstand the G-forces.

===BPM-2 and BPM-5===
In 2014/2015 the group designed, built and tested a series of smaller engines with a nominal thrust of 2 and 5&amp;nbsp;kN.
The BPM-5 class will fly on the Nexø I and II rockets in 2016/2018, paving the way for the much bigger Spica rocket and engine. The purpose was to validate the performance and operation of the group's new engine design direction. The tests were highly successful, with results exceeding expectations. Different fuel additives (such as [[TEOS]]) as well as different jet vane material were also tested.
The BPM engines are bi-liquid rocket engines using [[LOX]] and [[ethanol]], [[Regenerative cooling (rocket)|regeneratively cooled]] by the ethanol fuel. The spring/summer 2015 test firings used passive pressure blow-down, and in winter 2015/2016 will see the test firings continue with a dynamic pressure (DPR) regulation system, which then will fly on the Nexø II rocket in spring 2018.

===Engines and propellant 2008 - 2014===
From 2008 to 2012, the group based the work on a [[hybrid rocket]], using [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) as [[oxidizer]]. Originally, the HEAT-1X rocket was to be fuelled by [[paraffin wax]], but a ground test 28 February 2010 revealed that some of the paraffin wax had only partially melted, instead of evaporating. The result was that HEAT-1X had less power than expected. A ground test firing of HEAT-1X-P (P for [[polyurethane]]) was conducted 16 May 2010. It was positive, the polyurethane had the right power but showed heavy [[oscillation]]. Until 2011 the group had performed more than 30 tests of various engine types at their [[rocket engine test facility]] at [[Refshaleøen, Copenhagen|Refshaleøen]]. In fall of 2012 a concept engine using [[white fuming nitric acid]] and [[furfuryl alcohol]] was tried using a static test setup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ing.dk/artikel/132056-spectra-testen | title=Spectra-testen | accessdate=September 10, 2012 | author=Madsen, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was decided to switch to bi-propellant, liquid fuelled engines running on liquid oxygen and ethanol.

===HATV===
[[File:Hatv guidance 320.jpg|thumb|Static test of the HATV at Refshaleøen 2011]]
The HATV (Hybrid Atmospheric Test Vehicle) was a 220&amp;nbsp;mm diameter hybrid booster, used for testing purposes, it is 1/3 the size of the HEAT rocket. It produces approximately 12&amp;nbsp;kN thrust within a combustion time of 20 seconds.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===HEAT-1X===
{{Main article|HEAT 1X Tycho Brahe}}
HEAT 1X (''Hybrid Exo Atmospheric Transporter'')&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://copenhagensuborbitals.com/spacecraft.php|title=Spacecraft|publisher=Copenhagen Suborbitals|accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Launch vehicle|rocket booster module]], intended to launch the Space capsule ''Tycho Brahe'' into space, the combination being known as HEAT-1X TYCHO BRAHE.
The rocket design was the result of numerous static booster tests of the solid fuel [[resin|epoxy]] and the liquid oxidizer [[nitrous oxide]]. A combination which was also used in the scale-down test rocket HATV (''Hybrid Atmospheric Test Vehicle'') which was only 1/3 size of the HEAT.
Stabilization of the rocket was by [[rolleron]]s, a mechanism also used to stabilize missiles. The rocket was successfully launched 3 June 2011 but the test was aborted at an altitude of 2.8&amp;nbsp;km.

===TM-65 and TM-65 IIA and TM-65 IIB===
{{Main article|TM65}}
TM-65 and TM6-5 IIA/B were [[Liquid-propellant rocket|liquid propellant engine]]s using 75% [[Ethanol]] and liquid oxygen (LOX) as [[oxidizer]]. These engines produced about 65&amp;nbsp;kN thrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TM65 Liquid propellant rocket engine|url=https://copenhagensuborbitals.com/tm65.php|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; First static tests were conducted in May 2012. One TM65 II engine was for HEAT-2X and one was for HEAT-1600 LE. The TM-65 engine passed the test undamaged, and was fired at up to 50% of its rated thrust. The group planned to repeat the test with higher thrust levels, until the TM-65 class in 2014 was abandoned in favour of the BPM-100 engine concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=En stor dag for suborbitals.|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/129424-en-stor-dag-for-suborbitals|accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2012|6|20}}

===HEAT-2X===
The HEAT-2X was a rocket built for flight testing the TM-65 engine. It was planned to carry a 1:3 scale, 80&amp;nbsp;kg space capsule mock-up, TDS-80, into the stratosphere.

The rocket was not flown as it suffered an engine fire during a static test in the summer of 2014. The rocket nozzle imploded and a welding seam opened resulting in the expulsion of all the ethanol fuel (some 500 L) in just 3 seconds resulting in a large fire which damaged the part of the rocket.
The engine failure and subsequent fire was filmed&lt;ref name="Youtube"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-4n-2MtECE] Gopro Hero 3 camera&lt;/ref&gt; up close with a high speed camera, which although burned on the outside, survived the inferno enough for the film to be recovered.

===HEAT-1600 LE and HEAT-1600===
The HEAT-1600 LE and HEAT-1600 (after the 1600&amp;nbsp;mm diameter of the rockets), were the biggest rocket concept by the group, and was in pre-production in 2013. However, the 1600&amp;nbsp;mm diameter rocket and capsule concept was abandoned in 2014, in favour of the 950&amp;nbsp;mm diameter Spica rocket and capsule. HEAT-1600 LE was to be a full size version of the HEAT-1600 with only one TM-65 engine. The HEAT-1600 was planned to fly with a single 260&amp;nbsp;kN engine or a cluster of 4 x TM-65 engines fed by turbo pumps on a single stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/05/heat-1600-concept-development-the-manifestation-of-dreams-and-ambitions-for-download/ | title=HEAT 1600 Concept Development – The Manifestation of Dreams and Ambitions (for Download) | publisher=wired.com | date=2013-05-11 | accessdate=2013-05-12 | author=Von Bengtson, Kristian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tycho Brahe ===
{{Main article|HEAT 1X Tycho Brahe}}
{{Double image|right|Rocket tacking02.jpg|{{#expr: (150 * (700 / 504)) round 0}}|Tycho Sketch.jpg|{{#expr: (150 * (2848 / 4272)) round 0}}|Tycho Brahe being stacked.|Sketch of the Tycho interior}}
The micro space craft (MSC), named [[Tycho Brahe]] after the Danish [[astronomer]], has a steel pressure hull, with room for one passenger. The passenger would be able to view the outside through a [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Perspex]] dome.&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt; The occupant would fly in a half-standing/half-sitting position, in a specially designed seat, and wearing [[G-suit|anti-G trousers]] to avoid [[G-LOC|blackout]]. Another compartment contains both the high-speed drogue parachute and the low-speed main parachutes for deceleration. The sheer volume of the MSC will provide the [[buoyancy]] in the water upon touchdown.

The first MSC was christened "Tycho Brahe 1" and its first flight was uncrewed using a [[crash test dummy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Danish-Manned-Spacecraft-Built-by-Volunteers-153441.shtml | title=Danish Manned Spacecraft Built by Volunteers | author=Biliuti, Smaranda | publisher=Softpedia | date= 24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new aluminium MSC called [[MAX-1 (Spacecraft)|MAX-1]] named after [[Maxime Faget]] is under development.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
According to the group development on this capsule has been abandoned due to the physiological problems associated with large acceleration of a human in standing position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ing.dk/artikel/131361-store-nyheder-om-store-raketter | title=Store nyheder om store raketter | publisher=Ingeniøren | date=August 18, 2012 | accessdate=August 22, 2012 | author=Madsen Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The craft is now on display in the [[Tycho Brahe Planetarium]] in Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetariet.dk/oplevelser/udstillingen/rumkapsel-landet-p%C3%A5-planetariet |title=Rumkapsel landet på planetariet |publisher=planetariet.dk |accessdate=September 30, 2012 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109034516/http://planetariet.dk/oplevelser/udstillingen/rumkapsel-landet-p%C3%A5-planetariet |archivedate=November 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tycho Deep Space ===
[[File:TychoDeepSpaceAndLaunchEscapeSystem.jpg|thumbnail|left|Tycho Deep Space during testing of the Launch Escape System]]
''Tycho Deep Space'' is a space capsule developed by [[Kristian von Bengtson|von Bengtson]]. The first version officially named "Beautiful Betty" by [[Mikael Bertelsen]], the capsule's protector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://copenhagensuborbitals.com/contentgfx/bertelsen_daab.jpg | title=Capsule protector Mikael Bertelsen naming the capsule | accessdate=August 22, 2012 | author=Olsen, Jev}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uncrewed capsule was launched on 12 August 2012 at sea by a test [[Launch Escape System]], off the coast of [[Bornholm]]. The launch did not provide enough height for the parachute to deploy and the capsule was partly damaged on impact with the sea. The capsule is 2 meters in diameter, allowing for an astronaut to be in a horizontal position relative to the acceleration during launch and landing.

==Missions==

The group originally focused on launching from a land based [[spaceport]] like [[Andøya Rocket Range|Andøya]], [[North European Aerospace Test range|Kiruna]] or [[Naval Air Station Keflavik|Iceland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=da&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://ing.dk/artikel/97766-ground-launch-site-den-onde-joker&amp;act=url|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus however turned towards a sea launch, just outside the [[Territorial waters#Territorial sea|territorial waters]] of Denmark.
A permission to launch was given by Danish authorities, but the first option, the [[North Sea]], a possibility suggested by [[Danish Civil Aviation Administration]] (''Statens Luftfartsvæsen''), was rejected in 2009 by the [[Danish Maritime Authority]] (''Søfartsstyrelsen''). They preferred another area and then gave a formal and written permission to launch from the military [[firing range]] ESD138/ESD139, which is located on the position {{Coord|55|02|57|N|15|36|11|E|region:DK|display=inline}} in the [[Baltic Sea]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
It is just outside [[Nexø]] on the Danish island of [[Bornholm]] and is therefore nicknamed Spaceport Nexø. The CS then had to build a floating [[mobile launcher platform]] (MLP), called ''Sputnik'' after [[Sputnik 1|the Russian spacecraft]] which was the first [[artificial satellite]] to be put into orbit.
Their launch campaigns includes the following ships:{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* ''MLP-Sputnik'', at first had to be towed, but later it had two diesel engines installed, and now sails under her own power.
* ''MHV Hjortø'', a [[Home Guard (Denmark)#Naval Home Guard|Naval Home Guard]] vessel which serves as [[mission control]] and recovery vessel.
* Two small [[rigid-hulled inflatable boat]]s.

===2010: The first launch attempt===
The first full-scale test-launch aimed at 30&amp;nbsp;km altitude was planned to be conducted off the coast of [[Bornholm]] between 30 August and 13 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://copenhagensuborbitals.com/campaignsep2010.php LAUNCH CAMPAIGN SEP 2010], Copenhagen Suborbitals&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle carried a [[crash test dummy]] "Rescue Randy" instead of a human pilot, with crewed flight not planned for some years. The success criteria were the completion of the sea voyage and countdown with launch and recovery planned as a bonus.&lt;ref name="ing-criteria"&gt;{{cite web|last=Andersen|first=Kasper Brøndgaard|title=Experienced rocket builder doubts success (Danish)|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/111447-erfaren-raketbygger-tvivler-paa-succesfuld-dansk-opsendelse|publisher=Ing.dk|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Tuesday, 31 August 2010, the privately built Danish [[submarine]] [[UC3 Nautilus]] pushed the launch platform Sputnik carrying the rocket and spacecraft from Copenhagen towards the launch area near [[Nexø]], [[Bornholm]].&lt;ref name="ingtow"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ing.dk/artikel/111523-nyt-fra-raket-holdet-vi-naar-nexoe-kl-2030 | title=Nyt fra raket-holdet: Vi når Nexø kl. 20.30 | publisher=ing.dk | date=1 September 2010 | accessdate=1 September 2010 | author=Jensen, Mette Buck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A launch attempt was made on Sunday, 5 September 2010, 14:43 [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]],&lt;ref name=Ikke_i_luften&gt;{{cite web|title=Raketten kom ikke i luften|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/111678-raketten-kom-ikke-i-luften|publisher=ing.dk|accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the motor could not be started due to a failure of the [[liquid oxygen|LOX]] valve which is assumed to be caused by insufficient heating of the valve. The design famously included a consumer [[hair dryer]] for defrosting the LOX-valve; in effect it was not the blow-dryer but its power supply that failed.&lt;ref name=ingnext2&gt;{{cite web|last=Djursing|first=Thomas|title=Powerless hairdryer stopped rocket|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/111683-stroemsvigt-til-foetex-foentoerrer-stoppede-raket|publisher=ing.dk|accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group promised to come back the year after to attempt the launch again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ing.dk/artikel/111713-vi-er-stolte-vi-er-glade-vi-gir-aldrig-op | title=Vi er stolte - vi er glade - vi gir aldrig op...(Danish) | publisher=ing.dk | date=6 September 2010 | accessdate=1 January 2012 | author=Kristian von Bengtson and Peter Madsen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011: First flight of ''HEAT-1X Tycho Brahe''===
[[File:20110603-1851.jpg|thumb|right|HEAT 1X Tycho Brahe lifting off from MLP-Sputnik]]
Having done updates on the rocket, and the valve, and with MLP-Sputnik under her own power, and a support vessel, the group sailed again for Spaceport Nexø on May 28 at 4:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. They again met up with [[Home Guard (Denmark)#Naval Home Guard|MHV Hjortø]], a Naval Home Guard vessel that serves as [[mission control]] and recovery vessel.
The second launch attempt was more successful and the maiden flight took place 3 June 2011, at 16:32 local time (CEST) (14:32 GMT). The HEAT-1X rocket lifted off and ascended to an altitude of only 2.8&amp;nbsp;km,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/06/03/danish-teams-homemade-space-capsule-blasts-off/|title=Danish Team's Homemade Space Capsule Blasts Off|publisher=foxnews | date=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; because Mission Control had to shut the engine off after 21 seconds.&lt;ref name="success-pol"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://politiken.dk/videnskab/ECE1299139/flyt-jer-lige-lidt-nasa-her-kommer-danmark/ | title=Flyt jer lige lidt, Nasa: Her kommer Danmark | publisher=Politiken | date=3 June 2011 | accessdate=3 June 2011 | author=Astrup, Søren | author2=Lindqvist, Andreas | language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were problems with the parachutes, the ''HEAT-1X Tycho Brahe'' was recovered and the flight produced useful data for subsequent development of the program.

===2013: Guidance system development===

====SAPPHIRE-1 Mission====
''SAPPHIRE-1'', a modification of the HATV, was a 4.5 m rocket whose main purpose was to test the [[Guidance system|active guidance system]] developed by Copenhagen Suborbitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ing.dk/artikel/130956-katapultsaede-til-dansk-rumkapsel-skydes-op-til-12-kilometer-om-faa-dage | title=Ejection seat soon to launch | accessdate=2 August 2012 | author=Djursing, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was successfully launched on 23 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/kaempe-succes-raket-floej-lodret-til-over-otte-kilometer-159938|title=Kæmpe succes: Raket fløj lodret over otte kilometer - Ingeniøren|date=23 June 2013|website=Ing.dk|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nexø I===
Nexø I was launched Saturday, 23 July 2016, with inaugural BPM-5 engine. It was a partial success. The supply of liquid oxygen to the engine was insufficient due to partial premature evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://copenhagensuborbitals.com/roadmap/nexo-i|title=Nexø I – Copenhagen Suborbitals|website=Copenhagensuborbitals.com|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nex&gt;{{cite web|url=https://copenhagensuborbitals.com/nexo|title=Nexø 1 Guidance Navigation &amp; Control – Copenhagen Suborbitals|website=Copenhagensuborbitals.com|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nexø II===
The preparation of the launch of Nexø II is ongoing. However, as of April 2018, the rocket didn't get off the ground this year due to NoGo from the Swedish air traffic control. It launched on 04 August 2018, with slightly modified BPM-5 engine.&lt;ref name=nex /&gt;

==Goals and records achieved==
Some of the things Copenhagen Suborbitals have achieved so far are:
* Most powerful amateur rocket ever flown.
* First amateur rocket flown with a payload of a full size [[crash test dummy]].
* First [[Main engine cutoff|Main Engine(s) Cut-Off]] (MECO) command sent to, received and performed by an amateur rocket.
* Handling and orchestration of a sea launch, by a "small budget"-organization.
On 3 October 2013, Copenhagen Suborbitals was awarded the "Breitling Milestone Trophy" award by [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] at a ceremony in [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/news/37886-2013-fai-awards-ceremony|title=2013 FAI Awards Ceremony|first=Faustine|last=Carrera|website=Fai.org|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Søren Munch.

Accessed: 7 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support group==
On 5 October 2010 an independent group of space enthusiasts founded the Copenhagen Suborbitals Support group (CSS). The main purpose of this group is to "support CS economically, morally and practically in their mission". Within two days after its founding, CSS reached 100 members. November 15, 2011 marked a major milestone for CSS as 500 members was reached. As of early 2014, around 1000 members was recorded.

By paying a fixed monthly amount, the members of Copenhagen Suborbitals Support now covers most of the fixed costs for the project in addition to donating various forms of hardware.&lt;ref name="raketvenner"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rocketfriends.org/ | title=The official Copenhagen Suborbitals support group | publisher=Copenhagen Suborbitals Support | accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, CS was supported with {{£|12,500}} per month.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Julian.

'''''Crank Yankers''''' is an American [[Television program|television show]] produced by [[Adam Carolla]], [[Jimmy Kimmel]] and [[Daniel Kellison]] that featured actual [[Prank call|crank calls]] made by show regulars and celebrity guests and re-enacted onscreen by [[Puppet|puppets]] for a visual aid to show the viewer what is happening in the call. The show premiered in 2002 on [[Comedy Central]] and returned to [[MTV2]] on February 9, 2007, running again until March 30, 2007. The show screened in Australia on [[SBS Television]] and [[The Comedy Channel]] between 2003 and 2008.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In 2011, there was a pilot for a traditionally-animated spinoff called ''Birchum'' featuring Dick Birchum as the main character. He was redesigned to look younger and had a mustache. The pilot was made for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] but was not picked up as a series.&lt;ref&gt;http://splitsider.com/2012/07/watch-adam-carollas-failed-animated-pilot/&lt;/ref&gt;
==Behind the scenes==
The performers are given a basic outline of a premise by the writers, and call telephone numbers from a list of selected targets (known as "marks"). Using the basic premises, the performers improvise most of their lines, playing off of the responses of their marks, with the intention to keep them on the phone as long as possible.

With the exception of a few outside sources (including previous material from Jim Florentine and the [[Touch-Tone Terrorists]]), all the calls are made from [[Nevada]]. The [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]] makes it illegal in most states to record telephone calls without both parties' consent. Under Nevada law, only one of the parties has to give consent (i.e., the caller), so prank calls can be recorded without the consent of the prank victims. One result of this was the series' schedule of creating and airing new episodes was fairly sporadic due to most of the celebrities living in Los Angeles, having Los Angeles-based jobs, and so were only periodically able to go to Las Vegas to make calls. Adam Carolla, for example, took [[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|his radio program]] to Las Vegas once or twice a year, and while there would record new calls for the program.

The puppet designs were drawn by artist [[Todd James]] before being constructed based on the various marks' voices, and, along with a series of stock characters (such as "Niles Standish", "Bobby Fletcher", and "Special Ed") based on the performers' character voices, the calls are re-enacted for the skits. 

The main character puppets for the first season were constructed by Bob Flanagan's company [[Den Design]] with additional puppets built by BJ Guyer, Carol Binion, Rick Lyon, Ron Binion, Jim Kroupa, and Artie Esposito. An in-house puppet shop was set up for the following seasons to accommodate the fast-paced schedule of the show and the sheer volume of puppet characters required for each episode.

The puppets are puppeteered by Ronald Binion, Rick Lyon, BJ Guyer, Victor Yerrid, Paul McGinnis, Alice Dinean Vernon, and Artie Esposito.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Originally, the show was titled ''Prank Puppets''; it was renamed after Comedy Central lawyers deemed that it implied [[Malice (law)|malice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Adam Carolla Show: Matt Atchity (January 6, 2012)|url=http://www.adamcarolla.com/matt-atchity-2/|work=Podcast|publisher=ACE Broadcasting|accessdate=7 January 2012|date=January 6, 2012|quote=@31:00min: Crank Yankers was originally called 'Prank Puppets' and the pussy fucking lawyers said ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paris_75001_Place_des_Pyramides_Jeanne_d'Arc_equestre_by_Frémiet_S1.jpg|thumb|Emmanuel Frémiet's statue (made in 1874) of Joan of Arc in armor, located outside [[Place des Pyramides]] in [[Paris]].]]

'''[[Joan of Arc]]''' (Fr: ''Jeanne d'Arc''), a French historical figure executed by the English for heresy in 1431, is a national heroine of [[France]] and a [[Roman Catholic]] saint. Joan accompanied an army during the Hundred Years War, adopting the clothing of a soldier, which ultimately provided a pretense for her conviction and execution. Whether her [[crossdressing]] and lifestyle have implications for her [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] or [[gender identity]] is debated.

==Background==

Kelly DeVries notes that, "No person of the Middle Ages, male or female, has been the subject of more study than Joan of Arc. She has been portrayed as [[saint]], [[heresy|heretic]], religious zealot, seer, demented teenager, proto-feminist, aristocratic wanna-be, savior of France, person who turned the tide of the [[Hundred Years War]] and even [[Marxism|Marxist]] liberator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc / A Woman As A Leader Of Men| first=Kelly| last=DeVries| authorlink=Kelly DeVries| publisher=Garland Publishing| year=1996| pages=3}} Due to such widely differing interpretations of her life and its meaning, many interpretations of the implications of her adoption of male clothing and lifestyle have been debated.


Susan Crane comments, "Joan of Arc wore men's clothes almost continually from her first attempts to reach the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]], later crowned [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]], until her execution twenty-eight months later. In court, on campaigns, in church, and in the street she cross-dressed, and she refused to stop doing so during the long months of her trial for heresy. Joan's contemporary supporters and adversaries comment extensively on her clothing, and the records of her trial provide commentary of her own, making her by far the best-documented [[transvestite]] of the later [[Middle Ages]]" {{cite journal| title=Clothing and Gender Definition: Joan of Arc| first=Susan| last=Crane| authorlink=Susan A Crane| publisher=Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies| volume=26| pages=297| year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her capture during the siege of Compiegne while retreating from a failed attack at [[Margny, Ardennes|Margny]], Joan was sold to the [[England|English]], imprisoned, and subsequently put on trial for heresy. Despite the attempts by the judges to induce her to repent for her wearing of male attire, Joan repeatedly defended the wearing of this clothing as a "small matter" that was "the commandment of God and his [[angels]]." As Pernoud and Clin note, "Other questions about her mode of dress provoked only repetitions of these answers: She had done nothing that was not by the commandment of God. Probably not even Cauchon could then have guessed the importance that her mode of dress would come to assume."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Joan of Arc| first=Régine| last=Pernoud| authorlink=Régine Pernoud|author2=Marie Véronique Clin| year=1998| publisher=St. Martin's Press| pages=114}} As Beverly Boyd observed, "The issue was, of course, [Joan's] voices .. but the emblem of the heresy was her wearing of men's clothing." {{cite journal| title=Wyclif, Joan of Arc, and Margery Kempe| publisher=Mystics Quarterly| volume=12| year=1986| authorlink=Beverly Boyd| first=Beverly| last=Boyd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan signed a [[cedula]], possibly without understanding the text, indicating that she would no longer wear men's clothing, only to "relapse" later, giving the court justification to have her executed ("Only those who had relapsed -- that is, those who having once adjured their errors returned to them -- could be condemned to death by a tribunal of the Inquisition and delivered for death.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Joan of Arc| first=Régine| last=Pernoud| authorlink=Régine Pernoud|author2=Marie Véronique Clin| year=1998| publisher=St. Martin's Press| pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 30, 1431, Joan of Arc was burned at the stake.

==Historical context==

Life and society in the late Middle Ages was heavily dominated by the teachings of the church. Concerning crossdressing, [[Deuteronomy]] 22:5, which states, "The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2022&amp;version=9]&lt;/ref&gt; made crossdressing anathema. On the other hand, there were the guidelines of [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], who wrote that "... it is in itself sinful for a woman to wear man's clothes, or vice versa; especially since this may be a cause of sensuous pleasure ... Nevertheless this may be done sometimes without sin on account of some necessity, either in order to hide oneself from enemies, or through lack of other clothes, or for some similar motive.",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| first=Thomas| last=Aquinas| authorlink=St. Thomas Aquinas| title=Summa Theologiae II, II, Question 169, Article 2, Reply to objection 3| url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3169.htm}} thus giving some leeway to whether crossdressing is justifiable under church law in certain circumstances. Schibanoff states that, in modern terms, what church doctrine permitted and what medieval society in general would accept, is not merely [[cross dressing]], as partial or episodic transvestment where the subject's biological sexual identity remains apparent, but [[Passing (gender)|passing]], where the subject adopts all aspects of the target gender. {{cite book| title=Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc / Transvestism and Idolatry| authorlink=Susan Schibanoff| first=Susan| last=Schibanoff| publisher=Garland Publishing| year=1996| pages=41}}  The condemned were not those who wished to "better" themselves by becoming male, like the female saints, but those who "wear the breeches" or, as Chaucer's Wife of Bath, put on the spurs, but otherwise remain recognizably female. {{cite book| title=Crossdressing, Sex, and Gender| authorlink=Vern L. and Bonnie Bullough| publisher=Philadelphia| year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vern and Bonnie Bullough comment that despite the specific canons against it, one might search the church fathers in vain for overt and unconditional approbations on transvestism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Crossdressing, Sex, and Gender| authorlink=Vern L. and Bonnie Bullough| publisher=Philadelphia| page=51 |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, Susan Schibanoff notes that "one version of transvestism appears to have been both admired and encouraged, albeit indirectly, in the legends of female [[saint]]s who disguised themselves as men to live as [[monks]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc / Transvestism and Idolatry| authorlink=Susan Schibanoff| first=Susan| last=Schibanoff| publisher=Garland Publishing |date=1996 |pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, Joan's accusers were forced to carefully frame their accusations that Joan retained "nothing about her to display and announce her sex, save Nature's own distinctive marks". That is, unlike the holy transvestites, who totally disguised their sex, Joan had not concealed her anatomy or other "marks" of her biological femininity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc / Transvestism and Idolatry| authorlink=Susan Schibanoff| first=Susan| last=Schibanoff| publisher=Garland Publishing| year=1996| pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "holy transvestite" - i.e., transvestite female saint - was a common medieval archetype, and one of the grounds used to defend Joan's attire. [[Saint Pelagia]] followed the classic story: fearing for her virginity on her wedding night, she cut off her hair, donned male attire, left her husband, joined a [[monastery]], passing herself off as "Brother Pelagius". The devil tested her by framing her for the pregnancy of one of the nuns, and she was driven into exile.

With regard to the holy transvestites, Gaunt argues that "Sexuality is central to the construction of sanctity in the Middle Ages," and that holy men and women are not removed from sexuality, but continue to define themselves through reference to sexuality that has been reshaped and redirected. Gaunt agrees with Anson in the description of these stories as "monastic fantasy" that attempts to appease sexual longing by imagining a woman in the monastery who need not inspire guilt; however, the appeasing of the longing is complexly gendered by the apparent masculinity of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Straight Minds/Queer Wishes in Old French Hagiography: La Vie de Sainte Euphrosine| authorlink=Simon Gaunt| first=Simon| last=Gaunt| publisher=GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies| year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

15th-century Europe possessed a significant cultural lore of such saints extending back nearly as far as the history of [[Christianity]]. [[Thecla|Saint Thecla]], sourced from the [[New Testament Apocrypha]] The "[[Acts of Paul and Thecla]]", was so enraptured with the teachings of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] that she left her fiance and followed him, dressing as a man part of the time while in his retinue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Acts of Paul and Thecla| pages=Chapter 9, 9:25| url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/thecla.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thecla's story was very popular and widespread, with depictions of her and dedications ranging from [[Antioch]] to [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Acts of Thecla: A Pauline Tradition Linked to Women |authorlink=Nancy A.

Saint Margaret, for example, escaped on her wedding night in men's clothes. ... A saint especially popular among the common people in Europe from the eleventh century on ... was [[Wilgefortis|Saint Uncumber]]. She was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] princess who refused to be married to the heathen King of [[Sicily]], and prayed to God to be saved from this fate. Her salvation was unusual; she suddenly grew a beard. Variations on this theme recur more often ... As always, myth and reality interact, and several medieval women took these saints as their models. The example that first comes to mind here is Joan of Arc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Tradition of Female Transvestism In Early Modern Europe| authorlink=Rudolf M. Dekker, Lotte C. van de Pol| publisher=St. Martin's Press| year=1989| pages=45, 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, numerous legends and tales from Medieval Europe (and, likewise, elsewhere in the world) discuss transvestism and sex change (often miraculous). Folklorist Stith Thompson documents only a few traditional "sex tests" for unmasking men dressed as women, but numerous tests for women, ranging from placing a [[spinning wheel]] nearby to scattering [[peas]] on the ground to cause women to slip but not men. The latter example is well known from [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]], but can also be found in [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[As You Like It]], and the trick is even attributed to as far back as [[King Solomon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Tradition of Female Transvestism In Early Modern Europe| authorlink=Rudolf M. Dekker, Lotte C. van de Pol| publisher=St. Martin's Press| year=1989| pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these examples, female cross-dressers in Europe were little accepted. The only known case of accepted female gender inversion in Medieval Europe comes from the [[Balkans]], and extends back as far as the 15th century, as noted by a mention in the ''[[Qanun (law)|Kanun]]''. These women could escape the very rigid social rules by declaring themselves [[sworn virgin]]s, and would dress as men, live as men, and share the same status as them. Families without male heirs could even declare their infant daughters to be men and rear them as boys. Such a tradition did not exist elsewhere in Europe at the time. Dr. Carleton S. Coon noted the same custom among the mountaineers of Albania, and that under certain circumstances a woman dressing as a man becomes the head of the family and assumes a completely male role.

Bennett and Froide, in "Single women in the European Past", note: "Other single women found emotional comfort and sexual pleasure with women. The history of same-sex relations between women in medieval and early modern Europe is exceedingly difficult to study, but there can be no doubt of its existence. Church leaders worried about lesbian sex; women expressed, practiced, and were sometimes imprisoned or even executed for same-sex love; and some women cross-dressed in order to live with other women as married couples." They go on to note that even the seemingly modern word "lesbian" has been traced back as far as 1732, and discuss lesbian subcultures, but add, "Nevertheless, we certainly should not equate the single state with lesbian practices." While same-sex relationships among men were highly documented and condemned, "Moral theologians did not pay much attention to the question of what we would today call lesbian sex, perhaps because anything that did not involve a phallus did not fall within the bounds of their understanding of the sexual ... Some legislation against lesbian relations can be adduced for the period ... mainly involving the use of "instruments," in other words, [[dildo]]es."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Singlewomen in the European Past| authorlink=Judith M. Bennett and Amy M. Froide| year=1999| publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press| pages=10–11, 128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crane agrees, commenting on a "penitential doctrine that conceived homoerotic acts but not homosexual identity ... Discourses of sexuality such as ''fine amor'' and mystical marriage with God may be less visible now than penitential doctrine, but their effects on subjectivity deserve the greater efforts of recovery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Clothing and Gender Definition: Joan of Arc| first=Susan| last=Crane| authorlink=Susan A Crane| publisher=Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies| volume=26| pages=298| year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the time, Joan was familiar with a long line of female cross-dressers living fully male lives, often at what they saw as God's calling. However, while she may have been aware of the context, she knew that her transvestism, while potentially acceptable to a degree, still carried social risks.

==Historical perspective==
[[Image:Joan of Arc miniature graded.jpg|right|thumb|Joan of Arc in armor, with a sword.]]
During and immediately following her life, perspectives on Joan varied widely, often (although not always) along factional lines. Rumors of a woman leading an opposing army was historically used to incite troops against the obvious heresy, sorcery, and immorality. Comments from English soldiers at the time concerning Joan range from referring to her as a "bloody tart" to asking "whether she expected [her soldiers] to surrender to a woman" and referring to her troops as "unbelieving pimps". The English author of ''The Brut'' claimed that her troops followed her by "crafte of sorcerie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc / A Woman As A Leader Of Men| authorlink=Kelly DeVries| first=Kelly| last=deVries| publisher=Garland Publishing| year=1996| pages=4, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his defeat at Orleans, Bedford reported to the English crown that his men had been bewitched by a satanic agent in the form of a woman dressed as a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc / Le Franc on Gerson and Joan of Arc| authorlink=Gertrude H. Merkle| first=Gertrude| last=Merkle| publisher=Garland Publishing| year=1996| pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crane notes that she was referred to as "femme monstrueuse," "femme désordonnée et diffamée, estant en habit d'homme et de gouvernement disslut" ("monstrous woman, disorderly and notorious woman who dresses in men's clothes, whose conduct is dissolute").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Clothing and Gender Definition: Joan of Arc| first=Susan| last=Crane| authorlink=Susan A Crane| publisher=Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies| volume=26| pages=306| year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other side of the English channel, the situation was largely reversed. From the beginning, for whatever reason, there was surprisingly little hesitation on the side of the French. Of special note was the loyalty given to her by her soldiers, who were among the most skilled in France. The Bourgeois of Paris claimed that this was because, "all who disobeyed her should be killed without mercy", but the author of the ''Journal du siege d'Orleans'' noted that "All regarded her with much affection, men and women, as well as small children." Jean de Macon, an eyewitness to the siege of Orleans, noted that there was only one act of derision, while the Cronique de Lorraine added that "All the army promised to always obey her. Each victory motivated more loyalty and further victory. Even disobedience to her higher command seems to have invited loyalty; she brought action and victory, while the older, noble generals achieved nothing but inaction and defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc / A Woman As A Leader Of Men| authorlink=Kelly DeVries| first=Kelly| last=deVries| publisher=Garland Publishing| year=1996| pages=7, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;


These viewpoints tended to extend to her trials : first the Condemnation trial in the hands of the English, and later the rehabilitation trial under a commission appointed by Pope [[Calixtus III]] and organized by [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]]. As Pinzino notes, "The pro-English (Burgundian) party into whose hands Joan fell in 1430, over a year after her role in the vital French victory at Orleans, worked to defame her self-asserted divine calling and executed her at age nineteen in the marketplace of Rouen in 1431. In the years following, however, political power in France permanently reverted to the pro-French (Armagnac) party of Joan's supporters. Promptly after Normandy and the city of Rouen itself had been restored to the French (1449) and the ecclesiastical archives there were retrieved and opened, the proceedings to nullify Joan of Arc's condemnation were undertaken by her supporters ... these proceedings were virtually unprecedented in ecclesiastical judicial history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc / A Fifteenth-Century Defense| authorlink=Jane Marie Pinzino| first=Jane| last=Pinzino| publisher=Garland Publishing| year=1996| pages=162, 163}} 


The Condemnation trial found Joan's transvestism condemning. The primary cross-dressing charge, that Joan dressed entirely as a man "save Nature's own distinctive marks", was designed to evade Aquinas's exceptions on cross dressing—as Raoul Le Sauvage phrased it, to "escape violence and keep one's virginity", was predicated on total disguise and passing. Joan never attempted to "pass", but simply wore the attire of men, thus giving the English cause to condemn her for the act. {{cite book| title=Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc / Transvestism and Idolatry| authorlink=Susan Schibanoff| first=Susan| last=Schibanoff| publisher=Garland Publishing| year=1996| pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Charles VII, who owed his crown to Joan and had followed her, believing her to be divinely inspired, found himself now having been brought to power by a convicted heretic. On February 15, 1450, Charles dispatched a letter ordering the creation of a Royal Commission to reexamine the Condemnation trial, under the leadership of Guillaume d'Estouteville, Charles's cousin. As Pernoud and Clin note, "That trial was now a symbol of complex cultural fissures in search of closure: of the internal fractures of a riven France, of national splits enervated by English invasion, and of religious and civil power struggles sustained by the University of Paris."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Joan of Arc| first=Régine| last=Pernoud| authorlink=Régine Pernoud|author2=Marie Véronique Clin| year=1998| publisher=St. Martin's Press| pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rehabilitation trial focused strongly on the transvestism charge, which Pope [[Pius II]] noted was problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Memoirs of a Renaissance Pope| authorlink=Pope Pius XII, translated by Florence Gragg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals testifying during the trial stressed the necessity of her dress, both for means of keeping order in her troops in battle and for protecting her chastity. As the trial noted, she wore "long, conjoined hosen, attached to the aforesaid doublet with twenty cords ([[aiguillettes]])" and "tight leggings", with the cords being used to securely tie the parts of the garment together so her clothing couldn't be pulled off by the English guards.&lt;ref&gt;BAN Lat. 1119 f.47r; Proces... Vol I page 220,221&lt;/ref&gt; Guillaume Manchon testified, "And she was then dressed in male clothing, and was complaining that she could not give it up, fearing lest in the night her guards would inflict some act of [sexual] outrage upon her," a claim backed up by a number of other witnesses. The same justification was given for her relapse by a number of witnesses, such as Friar Martin Ladvenu, Pierre Cusquel, Giullaume Manchon, and Friar Isambart de la Pierre, although a number of others, such as Jean Massieu, Pierre Daron, and Guillaume Colles, alternatively claimed that she was entrapped into wearing male clothing by a guard who took away her female clothing). Jean Moreau testified that he had heard Joan reply to the preacher that she had adopted male clothing during her campaign because she had to live among soldiers, among whom it was more appropriate for her to be in male, rather than female clothing. The court ruled that "nothing improper has been found in her, only good humility, chastity, piety, propriety, simplicity."

These viewpoints remained the dominant perspective on Joan's crossdressing up until the modern age. As Régine Pernoud comments in the foreword to ''Joan of Arc'', serious books about her in any language "numbered only a few dozen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Joan of Arc| first=Régine| last=Pernoud| authorlink=Régine Pernoud and Marie Véronique Clin| year=1998| publisher=St. Martin's Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the lack of modern acceptance of and knowledge about gender identity and sexuality further limited discourse on the subject.

==Modern perspective==
{{Cross-dressing}}
One of the first modern writers to raise issues of gender identity and sexuality was novelist [[Vita Sackville-West]]. In "[[Saint Joan of Arc (biography by Vita Sackville-West)|Saint Joan of Arc]]", published in 1936, she indirectly suggests that Joan of Arc may have been a lesbian.&lt;ref&gt;She cites Simon Beaucroix's testimony, "Joan slept always with young girls, she did not like to sleep with old women." {{cite book| title=Saint Joan of Arc| authorlink=Vita Sackville-West| first=Vita| last=Sackville-West| publisher=Doubleday| year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebuttals were forthcoming and are widely mentioned. The most prominent rebuttal refers to the common medieval practice of women sharing beds with one another; bed sharing had no connotations in regard to sexuality. Bonnie Wheeler of the International Joan of Arc Society called the book "dead wrong but fun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.the-orb.net/bibliographies/joan.html| title=Bibliographies: Joan of Arc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pernoud credits Joan's clothing to necessity and her belief that it was ordained by God. Among other things, Pernoud cites large amounts of testimony, including Guillaume Manchon from the Rehabilitation trial: "... at that time, she was dressed in male clothing, and kept complaining that she could not do without it, fearing that the guards would violate her in the night; and once or twice she had complained to the Bishop of Beauvais, the Vice-Inquisitor, and Master Nicholas Loiseleur that one of the guards had attempted to rape her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Joan of Arc| first=Régine| last=Pernoud| authorlink=Régine Pernoud| year=2007| publisher=Ignatius Press| pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warner argues that in pre-industrial Europe, a link existed between transvestism and priestly functions, hence justifying the historical interpretation of her as both a [[witch]] and a saint. Warner further argues for Joan as not occupying either a male or female gender. "Through her transvestism, she abrogated the destiny of womankind. She could thereby transcend her sex. ... At the same time, by never pretending to be other than a woman and a maid, she was usurping a man's function but shaking off the trammels of his sex altogether to occupy a different, third order, neither male nor female". Warner categorizes Joan as an [[androgyne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Joan of Arc: The Image of Female Heroism | authorlink=Marina Warner| first=Marina| last=Warner| year=1981}}/ref&gt;

Transgender activist and author Leslie Feinberg argues in &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Transgender Liberation&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; that "Joan of Arc was burned at the stake by the Inquisition of the Catholic church because she refused to stop dressing as a man." According to Feinberg, "... she was a transvestite - an expression of her identity she was willing to die for rather than renounce." Feinberg criticizes the fact that "[m]any historians and academicians have seen Joan's transvestism as inconsequential. In the verbatim proceedings of her interrogation, however, the court records show that Joan's judges found her transvestism repugnant and demanded that she wear women's clothing. Joan of Arc's testimony in her own defense revealed how deeply her transvestism was rooted in her identity. She vowed, 'For nothing in the world will I swear not to arm myself and put on a man's dress.'"ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Transgender Studies Reader|last=Feinberg|first=Leslie|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=041594709X|editor-last=Stryker|editor-first=Susan|location=New York|pages=205-220|chapter=Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come|editor-last2=Whittle|editor-first2=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the direction of L’Académie française, the Centre Jeanne d'Arc in Orleans has been working on a re-edition of Jules Quicherat's ''Procès de Jeanne d'Arc''. According to Bouzy, Quicherat's work forms the basis of most modern scholarship on Joan, but has been discovered to contain a number of errors, selective editing, and use of "originals" that were often highly edited or manipulated versions of earlier documents. Relevant to Joan's crossdressing is Jacques Gelu's treatise, one of the theological treatise ordered by Charles VII for her rehabilitation. Quicherat criticized the text as "uninstructive hodgepodge", and, according to him, "made it considerably shorter, taking out parts of the passages where points of religious dogma are discussed." As Bouzy, a member of the Centre working on the project notes, "This text has hardly ever been consulted by historians, although it provides interesting evidence for the way the fifteenth-century church perceived Joan. The text stresses the problem of Joan's cross dressing — this shows that in 1429, even the prelates who supported Charles VII were reluctant to accept a young girl dressed as a man. Apparently, Charles VII decided in favor of Joan only because his confessor, Gérard Machet, was convinced that Joan was the girl whose coming had been announced in a prophecy by Marie Robine, a hermit from Avignon; and even then, Charles required that she be thoroughly examined. Several other treatises that have never been translated (apart from Gerson's tract) are likely to hold surprises for us as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc / Errors In Joan of Arc's Texts| authorlink=Olivier Bouzy| first=Olivier| last=Bouzy| publisher=Garland Publishing| year=1996| pages=75–76}} 

Weiskopf begins ''Secrecy, Specularity, and Speculation'' with the Bourgeois of Paris's recording of Joan's death, where he describes her being burned to death, then the removal of her clothes to show the audience that she was indeed female ("to take away any doubts from peoples' minds"), and the burning of the rest of her body. Weiskoph states, "What "doubt" haunts the crowd in the Bourgeois's description? And what secrets in this quasi-pornographic account are the spectators hoping to discover ... Anne Llewellyn Barstow offers the most literal explanation, linking the Bourgeois's morbid description to the crowd's fascination with and confusion over Joan's sexual identity. Troubled by the notion that a woman could be "a powerful war leader," both friend and foe "thirsted to know whether she was a man or a woman." Barstow's reading of the crowd's confusion over Joan's sexuality is neither the feminine or the masculine pronoun, the Bourgeois writes quizzically of Joan, "What ''it'' was, God only knows." Linked solely to her sexual identity or not, much of this uncertainty about how to interpret Joan remains." {{cite book| title=Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc / Readers of the Lost Arc: Secrecy, Specularity, and Speculation in the Trial of Joan of Arc| authorlink=Steven Weiskopf| first=Steven| last=Weiskoph| publisher=Garland Publishing| year=1996| pages=113, 114}}/ref
In the Journal of Modern and Medieval Studies, Crane writes, "Isolating transvestism from sexual identity risks assuming both that heterosexuality is the only possible position for Joan and that self-presentation has nothing to do with sexuality -- that sexuality is innate and prior to choices of gendered behavior." Crane argues that "an intensified relation to the law produces not her acquiescence in self-correction but instead her persistent effort to distinguish herself from the category of womanhood as she understands it." She notes Joan's repeated justification of her attire that it "pleases God that I wear it" ("il plaist a Deu que je le porte", etc.), dodges a question on whether she would liked to have been male,ref and comments that the argument that her defenders at the Rehabilitation trial used — male clothing as a protection against rape — does not stand up when considering how she kept herself identifiably female, slept naked both in field and prison, and given large amounts of Joan's own commentary. Crane backs up the distinction between Joan and the holy transvestites, in that Joan lays claim to her virginity and her womanhood instead of burying it, identifying herself not with the traditional religious crossdressers — as Bynum notes, "as brides, as pregnant virgins, as housewives, as mothers of God"—but as a fighter. "... Her continued engagement in secular affairs and her noninstrumental, secular cross-dressing queer her virginity -- that is, they move her virginity beyond its canonical meanings in ways that suggest a revision of heterosexual identity."{{cite journal| title=Clothing and Gender Definition: Joan of Arc| first=Susan| last=Crane| authorlink=Susan A Crane| publisher=Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies| volume=26| pages=297–314 | year=1996}}

In [[Gender-neutral pronoun|hir]] book, "Transgender Warriors: Making History From Joan of Arc to [[Dennis Rodman]]", transgender author [[Leslie Feinberg]] popularized the notion of Joan of Arc being [[transgender]]. Under the heading ''They Called Her 'Hommasse' '', Feinberg cites Evans and Murray on the "enormous importance" of Joan's male costume to her identity, and states, "Joan of Arc suffered the excruciating pain of being burned alive rather than renounce her identity ... What an inspirational role model -- a brilliant transgender peasant teenager leading an army of laborers into battle."{{cite book| title=Transgender Warriors: Making History From Joan of Arc to Rupaul| authorlink=Leslie Feinberg| first=Leslie| last=Feinberg| publisher=Beacon Press| year=1996| pages=36, 37}} In "Evolution's Rainbow: Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People", transgender biologist [[Joan Roughgarden]] cites and agrees with Feinberg's assessment, describing Joan as a "male-identified trans person".{{cite book| title=Evolution's Rainbow: Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People| authorlink=Joan Roughgarden| first=Joan| last=Roughgarden| publisher=University of California Press| date=May 17, 2004| pages=}}/ref

'''Donald Charles "DC" Pierson IV''' (born December 27, 1984) is an [[United States|American]] [[comedian]], author, and [[actor]]. He is best known for his involvement in the [[sketch (comedy)|sketch]] and [[improvisational comedy]] group [[Derrick Comedy]].

==Early life and education==
Pierson was born in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].

Pierson attended [[Mountain Pointe High School]], where he started acting and performing in a short-form improv group. He went on to attend NYU, joining the sketch comedy group [[Wicked Wicked Hammerkatz|Hammerkatz NYU]] in the fall of 2003. He worked as both assistant director and director during his 3-year tenure with the group. Pierson graduated from NYU's Dramatic Writing Department in 2007 with a degree in writing for television. He also made three brief appearances on NBC's ''Community'', on which his Derrick Comedy co-star [[Donald Glover]] plays a main character, as a ''Greendale Gazette'' member.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080227220523/http://newyork.ucbtheatre.com/performers/3391 ] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Derrick Comedy===
Pierson, along with other Hammerkatz alumni [[Donald Glover]], [[Dominic Dierkes]] and [[Dan Eckman]], formed the group Derrick Comedy after meeting at NYU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://odeo.com/episodes/4196173-Comedian-DC-Pierson-Interview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311032804/http://odeo.com/episodes/4196173-Comedian-DC-Pierson-Interview |date=March 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierson is both one of the principal actors and writers for Derrick Comedy.

Derrick Comedy has performed as an improvisational comedy group at the [[UCB Theatre]] in New York, but are best known for their sketches that appear on [[YouTube]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/derrickcomedy|title=Derrickcomedy|work=YouTube.com|accessdate=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CollegeHumor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.collegehumor.com/user:40756/uploaded ]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierson has played roles including an emo teenager and a man making a plea to the Godfather. Pierson co-wrote Derrick Comedy's first feature-length film, ''[[Mystery Team]]'', in which he also plays a self-described boy genius named Duncan.

===Other works===
On January 21, 2010, Pierson's first novel, ''The Boy Who Couldn't Sleep and Never Had To'', was released on [[Random House]]. The story follows two high school students who are social outcasts.

Answers on 13 August 2012. On the page, the student asked for help in reviewing the book, a task which had been assigned to her by her teacher. She stated that lack of time, among other things, caused her to be unable to read the book. The author's reply to the student was first recognized by Techcrunch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/13/author-fights-for-his-book-on-the-internet-after-slacking-student-pleads-for-a-quick-summary|title=Author Fights For His Book On The Internet After Slacking Student Pleads For A Quick Summary|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this coverage helped encourage more users to buy and read his book. One of Pierson's primary influences for his novel was the late [[J.D. Salinger]]. He is currently working on turning the book into a film, which will be directed by [[Dan Eckman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/dan-eckman-directing-boy-who-couldnt-sleep-never-had-to/111352/|title=MYSTERY TEAM Director Dan Eckman Adapting THE BOY WHO COULDN'T SLEEP AND NEVER HAD TO; Directing Episode of Community This Season|work=Collider|accessdate=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierson's second novel, Crap Kingdom, was released in 2013.

Pierson was featured on both of [[Childish Gambino]]'s "I Am Just A Rapper" mixtapes, contributing verses to three different songs, 49ers (Orange Shirt), The Truth (Goth Star), and Different (Feel It All Around). Pierson along with Nick Packard was also featured on Childish Gambino's "Assassins" from the 2008 Album "Sick Boi". He was also featured along with Amber Petty on Childish Gambino's "Starlight" from the 2009 album Poindexter. [[Childish Gambino]] is the rap moniker of his fellow Derrick Comedy member, [[Donald Glover]]. He is also credited with the story told during "That Power" on [[Childish Gambino]]'s Camp.

DC Pierson has made a mixtape called "Something Has Survived: A Small Rap Mixtape."

Pierson writes short stories on his website as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcpierson.com/|title=ham fisted theatrics heard that you always kinda wondered|work=Dcpierson.com|accessdate=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Pierson appeared on the [[YouTube]] sketch-comedy show ''[[Let's Talk About Something More Interesting]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eud5QL9GdAk&amp;feature=related|title=DC Pierson @ Let's Talk About Something More Interesting|date=11 January 2012|work=YouTube.com|accessdate=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Pierson had a brief cameo in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] tech support.

'''Derek Roy Taunt''' (16 November 1917&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|(Note 1)]]&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ndash; 15 July 2004) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]] who worked as a [[Cryptanalysis|codebreaker]] during [[World War II]] at [[Bletchley Park]].

Taunt attended [[Enfield Grammar School|Enfield Grammar]], then the [[City of London School]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1467625/Derek-Taunt.html|title=Obituary: Derek Taunt|date=23 July 2004|newspaper=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied mathematics at [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] between 1936 and 1939.&lt;ref name="taunt"&gt;Derek Taunt, ''Hut 6 From the Inside'', pp. 77-93 in ''Action this Day'', edited by Ralph Erskine and Michael Smith, 2001, {{ISBN|0-593-04982-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was accepted as a research student by [[G. H. Hardy]], but this was postponed by the outbreak of World War II. Taunt registered with the Joint Recruiting Board, and was initially allocated to work on [[ballistics]] at Kemnal Manor in [[Chislehurst]], preparing range tables for new weapons. Finding that the task required only trivial mathematics ("more like advanced arithmetic than real mathematics"&lt;ref name="taunt"/&gt;), he sought more appropriate work.

In August 1941 he was moved to Bletchley Park and assigned to [[Hut 6]], the section in charge of decrypting German Army and Air Force [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] signals. While there, he was best man at the marriage of co-workers [[Bob Roseveare]] and Ione Jay.

After his wartime work, he returned to Cambridge, and worked on [[group theory]]. He was a research student (1945), wrote a doctoral dissertation under [[Philip Hall]], won a [[Smith's Prize]] in 1949, and was a Lecturer from 1949 with the honorific title of 'Cayley Lecturer' from 1965 until retirement in 1982. As a Fellow of [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]] he was at various times a director of studies, tutor, bursar, and from 1979 to 1982 was President.  In 1982 he became Emeritus Fellow, "with most of the privileges and none of the duties of a Fellow." His doctoral students include [[Roger Carter (mathematician)|Roger Carter]].

On 18 December 1952 Taunt was elected a member of the [[London Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsletter.lms.ac.uk/330/330_09.html Deaths: DEREK TAUNT, LMS Newsletter, London Mathematical Society] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140217151614/http://newsletter.lms.ac.uk/330/330_09.html |date=2014-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
1. The obituary published in the Telegraph gives his birth date as the 16th,&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; while that in the 2004 Jesus College Annual Report incorrectly records it as the 17th.&lt;ref name="jesus"&gt;[http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/alumni/publications/Annual%20Report%202004.pdf Jesus College Annual Report for 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630001411/http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/alumni/publications/Annual%20Report%202004.pdf |date=2006-06-30 }}, p. 83-85&lt;/ref&gt; GRO death index gives it as the 16th.

2. Derek Taunt gives an account of his war work in: {{cite book  | first1 = F.H. | last1 = Hinsley | first2 = Alan | last2 = Stripp |title = Codebreakers: The inside story of Bletchley Park | publisher = [[OUP]] | year = 1994   | isbn = 0-19-285304-X | chapter = 13: Hut 6 1941-1945}}

'''Elisabeth Volkenrath''' (née Mühlau; 5 September 1919 – 13 December 1945) was a German supervisor at several [[Nazi concentration camps]] during [[World War II]].

Volkenrath, née Mühlau, was an ''ungelernte Hilfskraft'' (unskilled worker) when she volunteered for service in a concentration camp. She started in October 1941 at [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] as a simple ''[[Aufseherin]]''. In March 1942, she went to [[Auschwitz Birkenau]] where she worked in the same function as at Ravensbrück. At Auschwitz, she met ''SS-Rottenführer'' Heinz Volkenrath, who had worked there since 1941 as ''SS-Blockführer''. They married in 1943. Elisabeth Volkenrath participated in the selection of prisoners for the gas chambers and in November 1944 was promoted to ''Oberaufseherin'' for all camp sections for female prisoners at Auschwitz.&lt;ref name="New Exhibition Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knoch|first=Habbo (ed)|title=Bergen-Belsen: Wehrmacht POW Camp 1940–1945, Concentration Camp 1943–1945, Displaced Persons Camp 1945–1950.

Elisabeth Volkenrath was transferred to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] when Auschwitz was closed. From February 1945, she was ''Oberaufseherin'' (supervising wardress) at Bergen-Belsen.&lt;ref name="New Exhibition Guide"/&gt;{{rp|218}}

==Belsen trial==
In April 1945, she was arrested by the [[British Army]], and stood trial in the [[Belsen Trial]]. Found guilty, she was [[death sentence|sentenced to death]], and executed by hanging at [[Hamelin]] prison by [[Albert Pierrepoint]] on 13 December 1945.&lt;ref name="New Exhibition Guide"/&gt;{{rp|218}}

His family relocated to [[Richmond, Virginia]] when Yamin was 11, and his parents divorced when he was 14, his father returning to Los Angeles. Yamin went to school in Richmond at Tuckahoe Middle School, and later, [[Douglas S. Freeman High School]]. Dropping out of high school in his [[wiktionary:sophomore|sophomore]] year, he later achieved a high school [[General Educational Development|GED]] while working at [[Foot Locker]] (in their management program), a pharmacy, and as an on-air disc jockey for local R&amp;B radio station [[WCDX|WCDX/Power 92 FM]], using the name '''E-Dub'''&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite web | title = ‘Idol’ Yamin’s mom surprised by his talent | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12707801/ | publisher=MSNBC.com, AP, Michael Felberbaum, May. 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; before auditioning for ''American Idol''.
Yamin has an older half-sister on his mother's side, Jodi Queen, a married mother of two children (Yamin's niece Sophia and nephew Jed) and a younger brother, Scott Yamin, in pharmacy school at [[Campbell University]] in Buies Creek, North Carolina.&lt;ref name="reality"&gt;{{cite web | title = Former 'American Idol' finalist Elliott Yamin's mother Claudette dies

Yamin first discovered his vocal talent while singing karaoke in his late teens. Although he had not been musically trained, he sang in a local jazz band and in amateur performance forums emulating [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Whitney Houston]], and [[Donny Hathaway]].

Yamin was in Viña Del Mar, Chile, during the 8.8 magnitude [[2010 Chile earthquake]] on February 27, 2010.

Yamin auditioned in Boston, Massachusetts, singing [[Leon Russell]]'s "[[A Song for You]]",&lt;ref&gt;[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=elliott yamin|bio=true}} Billboard.com - Biography - Elliott Yamin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but his audition was not aired (it was later aired on October 24, 2009, as part of the ''[[American Idol Rewind]]'' - season 5 show). He performed the song again in front of the judges during Hollywood rounds, as well as [[Rascal Flatts]]'s "[[Bless the Broken Road]]". During the group auditions, Yamin and his group performed "It's In Her Kiss" (aka "The Shoop Shoop Song") from [[Betty Everett]]; [[Simon Cowell]] disliked the group performance, but [[Randy Jackson]] said Yamin was the best one in his group, and [[Paula Abdul]] said it was a good thing she could look past two left feet, in a way of saying he did not dance well but he could definitely sing. He was sent through by the judges and made it through to the finals of the competition.

During one weekly rehearsal, guest coach Stevie Wonder told Yamin that he should definitely pursue a career in music. [[Simon Cowell]] stated that he thought Yamin was "potentially the best male vocalist" in five seasons on ''American Idol'' and later, after Yamin's "A Song for You" performance, he declared that it was a "vocal masterclass". His performance of "A Song for You" ranked third on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s countdown of the 16 best American Idol performances in the series history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Slezak | first =Michael | title ='American Idol': The 16 Best Performances Ever | work =Entertainment Weekly | url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20007164_20171835_20189900_14,00.html | accessdate = 2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the May 10, 2006, results show Yamin, [[Taylor Hicks]], and [[Katharine McPhee]] were announced as the top three finalists. All three returned to their respective hometowns for a day of festivities in their honor. Yamin's homecoming visit included radio and television interviews; performing "Home" for more than 4,000 fans, capped by Mayor [[Douglas Wilder]] presenting the key to the city; and meeting Governor [[Tim Kaine]], whom Yamin greeted with a hug. Yamin threw out the first pitch before a sold-out crowd at [[The Diamond (Richmond, Virginia)|The Diamond]] for a [[Richmond Braves]] game and sang a verse a cappella of "A Song for You".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last =Roop | first =Jason | title =Elliott's Return | work =Style Weekly | date =2006-05-17 | url = http://www.styleweekly.com/article.asp?idarticle=12340 | accessdate = 2008-01-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080508053713/http://www.styleweekly.com/article.asp?idarticle=12340 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video highlights were shown on the top three results show.

Yamin was eliminated from ''American Idol'' on May 17, 2006, after the tightest race; each of the three top contestants received an almost exactly equal percentage of the viewer votes necessary for advancement to the remaining two spots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Dehnart | first =Andy | title =Lack of ‘Idol’ vote information frustrates fans | work =MSNBC | date =2006-05-23 | url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12819946/ | accessdate = 2007-12-22 }}

*&lt;small&gt;{{note|1|Note 1}}: When [[Ryan Seacrest]] announced the results for this particular night, Yamin was among the Bottom 2 but declared safe when [[Paris Bennett]] was eliminated.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Semi-finals:'''
*'''Week 1:''' "[[If You Really Love Me]]" (Stevie Wonder) The judges loved his performance. Jackson called him a hot one and brilliant, Abdul said it was a great performance since beginning to end, and Cowell called him potentially the best male vocalist in the show in five seasons.
*'''Week 2:''' "[[Moody's Mood For Love]]" ([[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]]) Jackson gave Yamin a stand-up ovation, Abdul said his performance was brilliant, and Cowell said although he was growing on confidence and gave a great performance, he "can't win a show like this with a song like that".
*'''Week 3:''' "[[Heaven (Bryan Adams song)|Heaven]]" ([[Bryan Adams]]) Jackson said he would sign Yamin right after his performance, and Abdul called him phenomenal, amazing and fantastic. Cowell though said it was a copout and for the first time there was a disconnect between Yamin and the song.
'''Finals:'''
*'''Week 1: Stevie Wonder''' - "[[Knocks Me Off My Feet]]" Jackson said it was not Yamin's best performance but at the end it was good. Abdul loved his passion, and Cowell said it lacked of originality and lacked the "wow" factor, although it was a good rendition. Guest Stevie Wonder confessed to be impressed with Yamin, and said he should definitely choose singing as a profession.
*'''Week 2: Songs of the '50s''' - "[[Teach Me Tonight]]" ([[Al Jarreau]]) Jackson said Yamin chose the toughest song of the night and he worked it out. Abdul said she was moved by his performance, and Cowell said it was fantastic. Guest [[Barry Manilow]] said Yamin sings great but should keep remembering him about the story on the song.
*'''Week 3: Songs of the 21st Century''' - "[[I Don't Want To Be]]" ([[Gavin DeGraw]]) Jackson and Abdul liked the performance and the arrangements, Jackson calling Yamin a hot one, while Abdul called him "a funky white boy". Cowell said: "great song, terrible arrangement, good vocals and hideous dancing"; show host [[Ryan Seacrest]] liked the equation.
*'''Week 4: Country Songs''' - "[[If Tomorrow Never Comes]]" ([[Garth Brooks]]) Jackson said the competition finally started with Yamin's rendition. Abdul called him humble and understated, and stated he has a reckless abandon. Cowell called it safe and thought Yamin was nervous that night, which Yamin agreed. Guest [[Kenny Rogers]] thought Yamin could do great with the song. Yamin was in the Bottom 2 that week.
*'''Week 5: [[Queen (band)|Queen]]''' - "[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]" Jackson said he sang the hardest song and loved it despite some pitch problems. Abdul said he was the best vocals of the night and said it was his best performance so far. Cowell agreed in that Yamin chose the tough one and he pulled it off. Guests [[Brian May]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]] (Queen members) thought Yamin chose the tough one that night and did a good job. Yamin was in the Bottom 3 that week.
*'''Week 6: Songs from The Great American Songbook''' - "[[It Had to Be You (song)|It Had to Be You]]" ([[Frank Sinatra]]) Jackson said Yamin did a very nice job, and Abdul loved his performance. Cowell said it was a good vocal, but that he showed no personality, to what Yamin replied "I disagree"; Jackson and Abdul disagreed with Cowell too. Guest [[Rod Stewart]] called Yamin a blue-eyed soul.
*'''Week 7: Love Songs''' - "A Song for You" (Leon Russell as performed by Donny Hathaway) Jackson hated the arrangements but loved Yamin's performance. Abdul was moved to tears and called Yamin an American Idol and said he celebrates what the competition is about. Cowell called it superb and said it was in part a vocal masterclass. Guest [[David Foster]] seemed impatient with Yamin, but recognized he sings well.
*'''Week 8: Songs from the contestant's birth year (1978); Songs from the Top 10 of any Billboard Chart''' - "[[On Broadway (song)|On Broadway]]" (by [[Barry Mann]] &amp; [[Cynthia Weil]], recorded by [[George Benson]]); "[[Home (Michael Buble song)|Home]]" ([[Michael Bublé]]) Jackson and Abdul said Yamin started rough in "On Broadway", but then got it together, while Cowell said it was disjointed. After "Home", Jackson said Yamin showed a tender side and made a nice job, and Abdul said it showed the richness of his voice. Cowell though said he was slightly worried for Yamin for singing a song that states he wants to go home and because the song has not enough of a hook. Yamin was in the Bottom 2 that week.
*'''Week 9: [[Elvis Presley]]''' - "[[If I Can Dream]]"; "[[Trouble (Elvis Presley song)|Trouble]]" The judges liked his rendition of "If I Can Dream"; Jackson said it was hot, Abdul said it was his best vocal performance during the season, and Cowell said Yamin came to the show that night as the underdog, chose a song that not many people know and yet gave the best performance. Jackson and Abdul said "Trouble" was Yamin's best performance ever, and Cowell said Yamin fought, showed personality and deserved to get through to the next round. Guest [[Tommy Mottola]] said Yamin is a laidback kid and that he pulled it off well.
*'''Week 10: [[Clive Davis]]' pick; Judge's pick (Paula Abdul); Contestant's pick''' - "[[Open Arms (Journey song)|Open Arms]]" ([[Journey (band)|Journey]]); "[[What You Won't Do for Love (song)|What You Won't Do for Love]]" ([[Bobby Caldwell]]); "[[I Believe to My Soul]]" ([[Ray Charles]], as performed by Donny Hathaway) The judges had divergent opinions about "Open Arms", with Jackson saying he had problem in the chorus and he should take chances, Abdul said he was in excellent voice and did a great job, and Cowell said he was stiff and he should loosen up. Same happened with "What You Won't Do for Love": Jackson said Yamin was sharp, Abdul liked it and Cowell said he was pretty good because the style suit him although it was not the best song in the world. After "I Believe To My Soul" Jackson said it was not the perfect song for him but he could definitely sing and he did a good job, Abdul said nobody can sing songs like that like he did and called him a funky white boy again, and Cowell said Yamin is a great guy and a great singer and has made his mother proud, but also stated his song choices would not carry him through to the next round. Yamin was eliminated that week.
'''Finale:'''
Yamin performed a duet with [[Mary J. Blige]] and participated in the Top 12 [[Burt Bacharach]]'s medley and the "guys' medley". 
*'''Guys Medley:''' "Takin' Care Of Business" ([[Bachman–Turner Overdrive]]) / "Tobacco Road" ([[John D. Loudermilk]]) / "Don’t Stop" ([[Fleetwood Mac]]).
*"[[One (U2 song)|One]]" ([[U2]] as performed by Mary J. Blige &amp; U2) with Mary J. Blige

*A {{anchor|endnote_A}}'''[[#ref_A|^]]'''For the issue date of April 7, 2007, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reported that first week sales placed the album at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/charts/2007-04-07/billboard-200 The Billboard 200]&lt;/ref&gt; Selling close to 100,000 copies in its first week is the greatest accomplishment for an indie release thus far, making him the highest new artist debut on an independent label in SoundScan history. The album also debuted at number one on the [[Independent Albums]] chart&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/charts/2007-04-07/independent-albums Independent Albums]&lt;/ref&gt; and at number eleven on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/charts/2007-04-07/r-b-hip-hop-albums Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums]&lt;/ref&gt;
*B {{anchor|endnote_B}}'''[[#ref_B|^]]'''Yamin's cover of [[Donny Hathaway]]'s song "This Christmas" was originally released as a single online to AOL Music and iTunes on December 6, 2006. The rendition was later included on ''Sounds of the Season: The Elliott Yamin Holiday Collection'', released in October 2007. Although the song was first released in 2006, it achieved its peak ''Billboard'' chart position in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/charts/2008-01-05/adult-contemporary Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]&lt;/ref&gt;
*C {{anchor|endnote_C}}'''[[#ref_C|^]]'''"Wait for You" was the first official single released from Yamin's self-titled debut. It premiered on radio on March 1, 2007, and was released to iTunes on March 13, 2007. The song was added to Z100 NYC's (the most listened radio station in the U.S.) Top 40 list in late May 2007, making Yamin one of the few independent artists to be played on that radio station.
*D {{anchor|endnote_D}}'''[[#ref_D|^]]'''"Wait For You" has been included in the ''[[Now That's What I Call Music! 25 (U.S. series)|Now That's What I Call Music! 25]]'' collection, the ''[[Radio Disney Jams, Vol. 10]]'' compilation, and the ''[[Kidz Bop 13]]'' album. The [[Jason Nevins]] GTR Mix of the song has been included on [[Ultra Records|''Ultra]].2008'', a collection of dance club remixes.

'''Felix Bloch''' (23 October 1905 – 10 September 1983) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[physicist]], working mainly in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hofstadter, Robert|authorlink=Robert Hofstadter|title=Obituary: Felix Bloch|journal=Physics Today|date=March 1984|volume=37|issue=3|pages=115–116|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v37/i3/p115_s1?bypassSSO=1|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130930140642/http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v37/i3/p115_s1?bypassSSO=1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-09-30|doi=10.1063/1.2916128|bibcode=1984PhT....37c.115H}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and [[Edward Mills Purcell]] were awarded the 1952 [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] for "their development of new ways  and methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements."&lt;ref name="fn_1"&gt;Sohlman, M (Ed.) ''Nobel Foundation directory 2003.'' Vastervik, Sweden: AB CO Ekblad; 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1954–1955, he served for one year as the first Director-General of [[CERN]]. Felix Bloch made fundamental theoretical contributions to the understanding of electron behavior in crystal lattices, ferromagnetism, and nuclear magnetic resonance.

==Life and work==
[[File:Felix Bloch 1950s.jpg|thumb|270px|Felix Bloch in the lab, 1950s]]
Bloch was born in [[Zürich]], Switzerland to [[Jewish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Quantum Exodus|author=Fraser, Gordon|chapter=Chapter 7|page=182|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwGhmwYyDLQC&amp;pg=PA182|isbn=978-0-19-959215-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; parents Gustav and Agnes Bloch.

He was educated at the Cantonal Gymnasium in Zürich and at the [[ETH Zürich|Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule]] (ETHZ), also in Zürich. Initially studying engineering he soon changed to [[physics]]. During this time he attended lectures and seminars given by [[Peter Debye]] and [[Hermann Weyl]] at ETH Zürich and [[Erwin Schrödinger]] at the neighboring [[University of Zürich]]. A fellow student in these seminars was [[John von Neumann]]. Bloch graduated in 1927, and was encouraged by Debye to go to [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] to study with [[Werner Heisenberg]].&lt;ref name="Stanford-physics-memorial"&gt;{{cite web |title="Memorial Resolution: Felix Bloch (1905 - 1983)" |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Robert |last2=Chodorow |first2=Marvin |last3=Schawlow |first3=Arthur |last4=Walecka |first4=Dirk |url=https://physics.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/BlochF.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170311100004/https://physics.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/BlochF.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 March 2017 |accessdate=11 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloch became Heisenberg's first graduate student, and gained his doctorate in 1928.&lt;ref name="Stanford-physics-memorial"/&gt; His doctoral thesis established the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory of solids]], using [[Bloch wave]]s to describe [[electron]]s in periodic lattices.

He remained in European academia, working on superconductivity with [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in Zürich; with [[Hans Kramers]] and [[Adriaan Fokker]] in Holland; with Heisenberg on [[ferromagnetism]], where he developed a description of boundaries between magnetic domains, now known as "[[Domain wall (magnetism)#Bloch wall|Bloch walls]]"; with [[Niels Bohr]] in [[Copenhagen]], where he worked on a theoretical description of the stopping of charged particles traveling through matter; and with [[Enrico Fermi]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="Stanford-physics-memorial"/&gt; In 1932, Bloch returned to Leipzig to assume a position as "Privatdozent" (lecturer).&lt;ref name="Stanford-physics-memorial"/&gt; In 1933, immediately after [[Hitler]] came to power, he left Germany because he was Jewish, returning to Zürich, before traveling to Paris to lecture at the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PQgaAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Because+of+his+Jewish+faith%22 "Bloch, Felix"], ''[[Current Biography]]'', [[H. W. Wilson Company]], 1954. Accessed 24 February 2013. "Because of his Jewish faith, his position soon became uncomfortable and he went to Paris, where he lectured at the Institut Henri Poincaré."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the chairman of [[Stanford University|Stanford]] Physics invited Bloch to join the faculty.&lt;ref name="Stanford-physics-memorial"/&gt; Bloch accepted the offer and emigrated to the United States. In the fall of 1938, Bloch began working with the 37 inch cyclotron at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] to determine the magnetic moment of the neutron. Bloch went on to become the first professor for theoretical physics at Stanford. In 1939, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States.

In 1940 he married [[Lore Misch]] (1911–1996), a physicist working on [[X-ray crystallography]], whom he had met at an [[American Physical Society]] meeting.&lt;ref name="royalsoced1"&gt;[http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf Former Fellows of The Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002]. royalsoced.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had four children.&lt;ref name="Stanford-physics-memorial"/&gt;

During [[World War II|WWII]], Bloch briefly worked on the [[Manhattan Project|atomic bomb project]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]. Disliking the military atmosphere of the laboratory and uninterested in the theoretical work there, Bloch left to join the [[radar]] project at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="AIP-oral-history"&gt;{{cite web |title="Oral Histories: Felix Bloch" |first=Weiner |last=Charles |publisher=American Institute of Physics |date=15 August 1968 |accessdate=11 November 2017 |url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he concentrated on investigations into nuclear induction and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]], which are the underlying principles of [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Alvarez | first=Luis W. |authorlink=Luis Walter Alvarez| last2=Bloch |first2=F. | year=1940 | title=A Quantitative Determination of the Neutron Moment in Absolute Nuclear Magnetons | journal=[[Physical Review]] | volume=57 | issue=2 | pages=111–122 | bibcode=1940PhRv...57..111A | doi=10.1103/PhysRev.57.111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1946 he proposed the [[Bloch equations]] which determine the time evolution of nuclear magnetization. Along with [[Edward Mills Purcell|Edward Purcell]], Bloch was awarded the 1952 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on nuclear magnetic induction.

When [[CERN]] was being set up in the early 1950s, its founders were searching for someone of the stature and international prestige to head the fledgling international laboratory, and in 1954 Professor Bloch became CERN's first Director-General,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://cds.cern.ch/record/1730968|title = People and things : Felix Bloch |accessdate = 1 September 2015|journal = CERN Courier|publisher = CERN}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the time when construction was getting under way on the present [[Meyrin]] site and plans for the first machines were being drawn up. After leaving CERN, he returned to [[Stanford University]], where he in 1961 was made [[Max Stein]] Professor of Physics.

At Stanford, he was the advisor of [[Carson D. Jeffries]], who became a professor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley.

In 1964, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00002770 |title=F.

'''George Poindexter''' (1779{{spaced ndash}}September 5, 1853) was an American politician, lawyer and judge from [[Mississippi]]. Born in Virginia, he moved to the Mississippi Territory in 1802. He served as United States Representative from the newly admitted state, was elected as Governor (1820–1822), and served as a [[United States Senator]].

==Early life==
Poindexter was born in [[Louisa County, Virginia]] in 1779.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=15-16}} He was the son of Thomas Poindexter and Lucy (Jones) Poindexter;{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=15-16}} the Poindexters were a large Virginia family of French [[Huguenot]] and English ancestry.&lt;ref name="Appleton"&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Poindexter, George|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poindexter received a sporadic education,&lt;ref name="Appleton" /&gt; primarily from studying under the tutelage of two of his brothers.  He was orphaned after his father died when Poindexter was 17; Poindexter inherited two slaves and a share of his father's land, and resided with an older brother until he came of age.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=18-19}} The Poindexter family of Virginia made frequent use of the names George, Thomas, and John; as a result, their genealogy is difficult to trace.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=15-16}}  He may have been the uncle of Ohio abolitionist preacher [[James Preston Poindexter]], whose father was Joseph Poindexter, a journalist at the Richmond Enquirer.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Martha. Preaching with Sacred Fire: An Anthology of African American Sermons, 1750 to the Present. WW Norton &amp; Company, 2010. p322-323&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact details of Poindexter's legal studies are not known, but according to family tradition, Poindexter [[reading law|studied under practicing attorneys]], first in [[Kentucky]], and later in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=21-22}}  He was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in 1800, and began to practice in Milton, an [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]] town along the [[Rivanna River]] which no longer exists.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|page=22}}

==Move to Mississippi==
[[File:George Poindexter 1808.jpg|thumb|left|George Poindexter, 1808]]
After moving to the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1802, Poindexter set up his law practice in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]].{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|page=28}}  He soon became a friend of Governor [[William C. C. Claiborne]], and a leader in the local [[Democratic-Republican Party]].{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|page=63}}  As a result, in 1803, he was appointed [[Mississippi Attorney General|Attorney General of the Territory]];{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|page=63}} he served until 1807,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trinity College |date=1942 |title=Historical Papers |volume=25-28 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nxQAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22george+poindexter%22+%22mississippi%22+%22attorney+general%22+%221803%22+%221807%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22attorney+general+of+mississippi+territory%2C+1803-1807%22 |location=Durham, NC |publisher=Trinity College Historical Society |page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he took up his duties as a member of the [[Mississippi House of Representatives|Territorial House of Representatives]], to which he had been elected in 1806.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=74-75}}  (He had been an unsuccessful candidate for the legislature in 1804.){{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|page=67}}

During Mississippi's early years, nearby areas were under Spanish control.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|page=75}}  When tensions rose over Mississippi's expansion, and the Spanish threatened an attack, residents of [[Adams County, Mississippi|Adams County]] formed a militia;{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|page=75}} Poindexter was one of the main organizers of a company in Natchez, the Mississippi Blues, and he was elected commander with the rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]].{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|page=75}}  No attack from Spain materialized, and the militia soon disbanded.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|page=75}}

When former [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] [[Aaron Burr]] appeared in Mississippi while traveling south as part of the [[Burr conspiracy]] in 1807, acting Governor [[Cowles Mead]] declared martial law, and appointed Poindexter and [[William B. Shields]] as [[aide-de-camp|aides-de-camp]] on his military staff, and sent them to interview Burr and determine his intentions.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=76-77}}  When Burr was arrested, Poindexter conducted the prosecution until Burr's escape from custody.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=76-77}}  After Burr escaped, Governor [[Robert Williams (Mississippi politician)|Robert Williams]] returned from vacation at his home in North Carolina to personally take control of the situation;{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=80-81}} he criticized Mead and fired the militia officers Mead had appointed, including Poindexter.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=80-81}}

==Territorial delegate to Congress==
Poindexter was elected as a delegate to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from the Mississippi Territory; he served in the [[10th United States Congress|10th]], [[11th United States Congress|11th]] and [[12th United States Congress|12th Congresses]] (1807 to 1813).{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=84-85}}  As a delegate, Poindexter concentrated his efforts largely on questions germane to Mississippi, such as federal patronage, as well as advocating for Mississippi's admission to the Union.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=84-85}}  Poindexter also worked to resolve and standardize land titles in Mississippi, where residents possessed deeds and grants from Spain, France, England, and the United States, due to the number of times the area had changed hands.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=104-106}}  He also opposed those who claimed the [[Yazoo lands]], but in 1810 the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Fletcher v. Peck]]'', resolved the claims in their favor.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|page=107}}

Before leaving for [[Washington, DC]] to begin his duties, Mead informed Poindexter of disparaging comments Williams had made to Mead about Poindexter following Burr's escape.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=79-80}}  Poindexter responded by challenging Williams to a duel;{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=80-82}} Williams replied that he would admit to any comment Mead attributed to him, but that he would not "involve either his public or private character with such a man."{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=80-82}}  Poindexter responded by writing letters to the editor that made it appear that he had been wronged by Williams and was unable to obtain satisfaction, which had the effect of making Williams appear cowardly in the eyes of his constituents.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=80-82}}

Poindexter was in Richmond in October 1807 to testify at Burr's treason trial;{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=82-83}} his testimony suggested that Burr's arrest had been based on flimsy evidence, which probably played a part in Burr's acquittal.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=82-83}}

In 1811, Poindexter's outspoken opposition to the [[Federalist Party]] resulted in a [[duel]] with wealthy merchant and planter [[Abijah Hunt]].{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=114-115}}  Poindexter killed Hunt, but afterwards Poindexter's political opponents alleged that he had broken the [[code duello]] by firing at Hunt prematurely.&lt;ref name="Appleton" /&gt;

==Judgeship and the House of Representatives==
Poindexter did not run for reelection in 1812; after his final term in Congress ended he was appointed as federal Judge for the Mississippi Territory, and he served from 1813 to 1817.&lt;ref name="Appleton" /&gt;  Poindexter also served as a volunteer aide to [[William Carroll (Tennessee politician)|William Carroll]] as Carroll commanded a division of Tennessee militia at the [[War of 1812]]'s decisive 1814 [[Battle of New Orleans]].{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=129-130}}

Poindexter was chairman of the committee that was appointed to draft a constitution for the new state of Mississippi. After its admission in 1817, he was elected to be the state's first representative in Congress.&lt;ref name="Appleton" /&gt; He served in the [[15th United States Congress|15th Congress]] from 1817 to 1819, when he chaired the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|Committee on Public Lands]].

After that, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1820 to the [[17th United States Congress|17th Congress]] and in 1822 to the [[18th United States Congress|18th Congress]].

==Governor of Mississippi==
In 1819 Poindexter was elected the second [[List of Governors of Mississippi|Governor of Mississippi]] by a large margin, winning more than 60% of the vote. He served from 1820 to 1822.  During his time in office he oversaw a reorganization of the militia, the state created its first free public schools, state courts were reorganized, and Jackson was selected as the site for the state capital.

==United States Senate==
Poindexter was appointed to the [[United States Senate]] in 1830 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[Robert H. Adams]], and served from 1830 to 1835. Soon after his appointment, he learned of the financial distress of [[Martha Jefferson Randolph]], whose father [[Thomas Jefferson]], the late president, had left an estate heavily encumbered by debt. Poindexter introduced a bill to grant Randolph 50,000 acres in Virginia, with the idea she could sell the land to raise money to live on. The bill failed to pass the Senate, and was rejected by the two Virginia senators in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcleepson.com/savingmonticello/excerpts/chap1.html Marc Leepson, Chap. One, "Stealing Monticello"], ''Saving Monticello: The Levy Family's Epic Quest to Rescue the House that Jefferson Built'', University of Virginia, 2001, accessed November 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Poindexter served as chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Claims|Committee on Private Land Claims]] in the [[22nd United States Congress|22nd Congress]] from 1831 to 1833, of the [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|Committee on Public Lands]] in the [[23rd United States Congress|23rd Congress]] from 1833 to 1835 and was [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate]] from June to November 1834.

Poindexter's tenure as chairman of the Committee on Private Land Claims had been considered moderately controversial at the time, as he had espoused some views that could be considered [[Socialist]], regarding government repossession of land. Poindexter was thought to have made these claims to support President [[Andrew Jackson]]'s fight with the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. He was a supporter of President Jackson, and had defended him against calls for [[censure]] stemming from the [[Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident]], but had slowly become less happy with the President's policies.&lt;ref name="Appleton" /&gt;

In 1834 Poindexter had his home in [[Washington, D.C.]] painted by [[Richard Lawrence (failed assassin)|Richard Lawrence]].  A deranged man, Lawrence came to believe that he was the ruler of England and the United States, and that Jackson was a usurper. In January 1835 Lawrence made two attempts to shoot at Jackson using two separate pistols, both of which misfired. The assassination attempt occurred as President Andrew Jackson was attending a memorial service for a Congressman at the House of Representatives. It was the first attempt to assassinate a President. Jackson accused various political enemies as being behind Lawrence. Among them was Poindexter, who denied any connection except for having his house painted. Poindexter also took issue with Vice President [[Martin Van Buren]]'s support of Jackson during the debate over the Bank, and made explicit threats that caused Van Buren to carry pistols for self-defense when presiding over the Senate.  The accusations about Lawrence followed Poindexter back to Mississippi, and he was unsuccessful in running for a second term.

He became embittered by these political problems in Mississippi due to his opposition to Jackson.&lt;ref name="Appleton" /&gt;

==Retirement from politics==
In 1835, Poindexter moved to [[Kentucky]], where he continued practicing law in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]]. He later moved back to [[Jackson, Mississippi]] and continued his law practice until his death there on September 5, 1853. He was interred in [[Greenwood Cemetery, Mississippi|Greenwood Cemetery]] in Jackson.

==Family==
In 1804 Poindexter married Lydia Carter (1789–1824),{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|page=66}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Charles Owen |date=1961 |title=The Genealogy of Several Allied Families: Frazer, Owen, Bessellieu, Carter, Shaw, Wright, Landfair, Briggs, Neill, Tidwell, Johnson, and Others |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSFWAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22lydia+carter%22+%22george+poindexter%22+brimfield&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Lydia+Carter+wife+Lewis+Williams+died+on+August+28%2C+1824%22 |location=Gretna, LA |publisher=Pelican Publishing |page=465 |ref={{sfnRef|''The Genealogy of Several Allied Families''}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of a prominent Natchez businessman and plantation owner.{{sfn|''The Genealogy of Several Allied Families''|page=465}}  They had two sons, George Littleton (or Lytleton) and Albert Gallatin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCain |first=William David |date=1995 |title=The Journal of Mississippi History |volume=57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zksTAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22george+poindexter%22+mississippi+sons+george+albert&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22albert+gallatin%22 |location=Jackson, MS |publisher=Mississippi Department of Archives and History |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They divorced after Poindexter publicly accused his wife of infidelity and claimed that their second child, whom he disavowed, was the product of an extramarital affair between his wife and their neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wyatt-Brown |first=Bertram |date=1994 |title=The House of Percy: Honor, Melancholy, and Imagination in a Southern Family |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swtTqxjN8nwC&amp;pg=PA73 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=73 |isbn=978-0-19-505626-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820 Lydia Carter Poindexter married Reverend Lewis Williams and moved to [[Brimfield, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|''The Genealogy of Several Allied Families''|page=465}}  Her sons remained with her;{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=134-135}} Poindexter provided for the support of George, but disavowed Albert and refused to provide for him.{{sfn|''The Early Life of George Poindexter''|pages=134-135}}

In 1816 Poindexter married Agatha Ball Chinn (1794–1822).  They had one son who died of yellow fever as a child while Poindexter was Governor, and Agatha Poindexter died soon afterwards.

He was said to have a serious liaison with a slave woman.

When several years before, Representative [[Richard Mentor Johnson]] of Kentucky was criticized for his common-law marriage with his slave Julia Chinn, he said, "Unlike [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], Clay, Poindexter and others, I married my wife under the eyes of [[God]], and apparently He has found no objections."&lt;ref name="burke"&gt;Henry Robert Burke. [http://www.coax.net/people/lwf/HRB_RMJ.HTM  Richard Mentor Johnson: "Window to the Past"], Lest We Forget Communications. Retrieved on January 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Burke has written,
&lt;blockquote&gt;During slavery times, there was no particular stigma attached to the fact that many southern plantation owners, along with their white [[Slavery in the United States#Efficiency of slaves|overseers]], often fathered [[mulatto]] children born of black slave women. As long as the white father denied the facts, the customs that created [[miscegenation]] were usually overlooked by Southern society.&lt;ref name="burke"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Johnson violated the norms by acknowledging Chinn as his wife and their daughters as his, plus trying to introduce his daughters to "polite society".&lt;ref name="burke"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3840">'''Zvi Hirsch Gregor Belkovsky''' (RU: Григорий Александрович Белковский) (1865 Odessa Russian Empire - 1948 Tel Aviv) was a jurist, political [[economist]], one of the leaders of the Bulgarian Zionists and an organizer for the [[first Zionist Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Political, Social, and ... edited by Spencer C. Tucker, Priscilla Roberts, ABC-CLIO,2008,  page 208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2821-belkovsky-gregoire&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier life ==
Belkovsky was born in 1865 in [[Odessa]], in the [[Kherson Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]) to Saul Sender who was a poor laborer. He studied in Jewish elementary school and was a gifted student. He later studied Law at [[University of Odessa]] and specialized in Roman and Criminal law. During his student years he was active in Jewish National movement in Odessa. Belkovsky won a medal for his work and after graduation he was offered a professorship which he rejected because it was conditional on conversion to Christianity. He did not receive a license to practice Law because he remained Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel, Volume 1, Raphael Patai Herzl Press, 1971 , page 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bulgaria ===
In 1892 while he was in Germany, Belkovsky met one of his former professors from [[University of Odessa]] which accompanied him to meet Bulgarian minister of Education Georgi Zhivkov. Zhivkov offered Belkovsky a professorship in [[University of Sofia]] and Bulgarian government headed by [[Stefan Stambolov]] approved this position immediately. This was unprecedented because Belkovsky was both foreign and Jewish. Upon his arrival in Sofia, he started learning Bulgarian language. Belkovsky published several articles on Roman law in Bulgarian and at the same time he was promoting Zionism in Bulgarian. Belkovsky was the leader of the Zionist movement in Bulgaria and met with Joseph Marco Baruch several times.

Belkovsky was very close to [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]]. In 1896 central Zionist Committee was established in Sofia and Belkovsky became its leader. On June 17, 1896 [[Theodore Herzl]] arrived in Bulgaria and met with Belkovsky.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2821-belkovsky-gregoire&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further activities ===
From 1891 even prior to establishment of [[World Zionist Organization]] Belkovsky was in contact with prominent Zionists. In September 1893 prominent European Zionists created a preliminary conference in Vienna which Belkovsky attended.

He was one of the extreme opponents of the Uganda plan and rejected any settlement of Jews outside Eretz Israel. After the October Revolution Belkovsky continued Zionist activities and was appointed chairman of Central Zionist Committee in Russia.

In 1924 Belkovsky was arrested in the Soviet Union and was sentenced to exile in Siberia. However his sentence was reduced to deportation and he was deported to Mandatory Palestine. In Palestine he continued to practice Law.

== Death ==
Belkovsky died in [[Tel Aviv]], in [[Mandatory Palestine]] on 11 January 1948 and was buried in a large funeral. He had one daughter.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Political, Social, and ... edited by Spencer C. Tucker, Priscilla Roberts, ABC-CLIO,2008,  page 208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2821-belkovsky-gregoire&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henri de Talleyrand-Périgord, comte de Chalais''' (1599–1626) was a favorite of [[Louis XIII of France]].

He was born in 1599 as son to Daniel de Talleyrand-Périgord, Prince de Chalais and Françoise de Montluc, daughter of [[Blaise de Lasseran-Massencôme, seigneur de Montluc|Maréchal de Montluc]]. He started to serve in the military early in his life. He was at the [[Siege of Montauban]] in 1621. He became Head of the King's Wardrobe to King Louis XIII.

He married Charlotte de Castille and fought and killed her lover in a duel.

He was accused of conspiracy against [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]], arrested at [[Nantes]], and [[beheading|beheaded]] by an unskilled axeman who took over 30 blows to sever the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.executedtoday.com/2009/08/19/1626-henri-talleyrand-chalais-marie-rohan-chevreuse/|title = 1626: Henri Talleyrand, Comte de Chalais|accessdate = 26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kamakahukilani Von Oelhoffen''' (1935&amp;ndash;1999) was a [[Native Hawaiian]] [[educator]], [[poet]], and [[activist]] known for her repeated assertion of the rights of indigenous [[cultural practice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namaka.com/transcripts/tribunal.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209110951/http://www.namaka.com/transcripts/tribunal.html |date=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Walking, Talking Education" was Kamaka's motto, along with other distinctive phrases, such as "Long Live Life."

Kamakahukilani was a contemporary of and close friend to [[Kawaipuna Prejean]].  Both were students of the legendary [[Pilahi Paki]].  Kamaka, Kawaipuna, and their friend (songwriter) [[Liko Martin]] travelled extensively throughout the continental U.S. and beyond, sharing music and culture with other [[activists]] and [[indigenous peoples]] worldwide.

Born Elizabeth Kamakahukilani Von Oelhoffen, she grew up in the housing projects of [[Palolo, Hawaii|Palolo]] Valley.  Her childhood friends included singer [[Kui Lee]].  Her mother was an activist, though she had to do this in hiding.  During the "[[Red Scare]]", her family hid [[haole]] socialists in their small home. Kamaka's schoolteacher, Gottfried Seitz, whom she described as an important mentor to the children of Palolo, was among those persecuted; his persecution was what inspired her to become an activist herself.

Her genealogy came from an ancient navigational line; hence the name "Kamakahukilani" (eyes that pull the heavens".  Throughout her life, Kamaka was fascinated by [[archaeo-astronomy]], star lore, [[navigation]], [[geometry]] and indigenous [[physics]].  She also studied Arabian astronomy, ancient architecture, and the works of historical figures such as [[Pythagoras]].  She was known for instructing her students at night with the use of her "kako'o", or walking-stick, to visually demonstrate the alignment of constellations, stars, and planets.

Kamakahukilani was featured in a 1983 [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] article on activism, which highlighted her struggles on the island of Hawai'i.  She was a strong figure in the struggles for [[Halawa Valley]] and [[Mauna Kea]], among others.

At one time Kamakahukilani served as [[Serjeant-at-arms|Sergeant-at-arms]] for [[Ka Lahui Hawai'i]].  However, she was always known for her "free agency" in working with all parts of the [[Hawaiian Sovereignty Movement]].

Kamaka was at one time married to a former prisoner who died soon after they married.  He gave her a copy of the book "[[The Prophet (book)|The Prophet]]" by [[Khalil Gibran]], which inspired her own writing.  Because of her marriage, Kamaka's legal last name was Palakiko at the time of her death.

Kamakahukilani died of cancer at the age of 64.

'''Yusuf Rahim''' (born '''Levi Rabetts''';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/307199|title=Levi Bellfield - a timeline|date=2011-05-26|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 17 May 1968), formerly known as '''Levi Bellfield''', is an English [[serial killer]]. He was convicted on 25 February 2008 of the murders of Marsha McDonnell and Amélie Delagrange&lt;ref name="bbc_students_conviction" /&gt; and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, and sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="bbc_students_conviction" /&gt; 

On 23 June 2011, Bellfield was found guilty of the [[murder of Milly Dowler]].&lt;ref name="bbc_dowler" /&gt; On both occasions, the judge recommended that he should never be released. He converted to [[Islam]] in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12125889/Milly-Dowler-killer-Levi-Bellfield-admits-crimes-for-the-first-time.html | work = The Daily Telegraph| accessdate = 10 July 2017 | date = 28 January 2016 | title = Levi Bellfield admits killing Milly Dowler for the first time | first = David | last = Barrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and personal life==
Bellfield was born at the [[West Middlesex Hospital]], [[Isleworth]],&lt;ref name="times_timeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesProfile"/&gt; Greater [[London]], to Jean and Joseph Rabetts (née Bellfield),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/36115/He-loathed-women-especially-blondes|title=He loathed women...especially blondes|last=Reporter|first=John Twomey, Crime|date=2008-02-26|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is of [[Romani people|Romani]] descent.&lt;ref name="TimesProfile"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jun/24/levi-bellfield-profile-milly-dowler| date= 24 June 2011 | work = [[The Guardian]] | location = London | accessdate = 21 November 2011 | title = Levi Bellfield: obsessed with schoolgirls and sexual violence| first = Caroline | last = Davies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Bellfield was 10 years old his father died, at the age of 52, from [[leukaemia]].&lt;ref name="TimesProfile"/&gt; He has two brothers and two sisters and was brought up on a southwest London [[council estate]].&lt;ref name="TimesProfile"/&gt; He attended Forge Lane Junior School then secondary school at [[Hampton High, London|Rectory Secondary School]], Hampton later moving to [[Springwest Academy|Feltham Comprehensive School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Richard|title=Milly Dowler murder: parents to learn if Levi Bellfield will face trial|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7536046/Milly-Dowler-murder-parents-to-learn-if-Levi-Bellfield-will-face-trial.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=30 Mar 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has fathered five children with three women, the three youngest with his most recent girlfriend, Emma Mills.&lt;ref name="times_timeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian_manzoor"/&gt; His first conviction was for burglary in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Richard|title=Levi Bellfield: A violent control freak|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1579859/Levi-Bellfield-A-violent-control-freak.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=26 February 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was convicted of assaulting a police officer in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7190212.stm|title=Levi Bellfield takes the stand|publisher=BBC | first=Ben|last=Ando|date=15 January 2008|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has convictions for [[theft]] and driving offences.&lt;ref name="TimesProfile"/&gt; By 2002, he had nine convictions and had spent almost one year in prison for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article3434436.ece| title =  Violent woman-hater Levi Bellfield is main Milly Dowler murder suspect| work = [[The Times]] | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
In an interview with the media, Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton of the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], who led the murder hunt, said of him: "When we started dealing with him he came across as very jokey, like he's your best mate. But he's a cunning individual, violent. He can switch from being nice to being nasty, instantly."&lt;ref name="evil"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7212354.stm
|title=Bellfield 'is controlling and evil'
|last=Bell
|first=Sarah
|publisher=[[BBC News]]
|date=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellfield searched for victims on streets he knew intimately. Detectives tracked down a number of ex-girlfriends, who all described a similar pattern of behaviour when they got involved with him. "He was lovely at first, [[Superficial charm|charming]], then completely controlling and evil. They all said the same," said Detective Sergeant Jo Brunt.&lt;ref name="evil"/&gt;

==Modus operandi==
{{BLP sources|section|date=August 2017}}
At the time of the attacks, Bellfield ran a [[Wheel clamp|wheel-clamping]] business which operated in and around [[West Drayton]] in west London where he lived.  Detective Chief Inspector Sutton speculated: "[Bellfield] has a massive ego to feed, he thinks he's God's gift to everyone. He drives around in his car, feels a bit 'whatever' and sees some young blonde girl. Young blonde girl says 'go away' and he thinks 'you dare to turn down Levi Bellfield, you're worth nothing' and then she gets a whack over the head. It is shown in the case of Kate Sheedy. She was smart enough to think she didn't like the look of his car and crosses the road. He thinks 'You think you're so clever' and whoosh, he runs her over."&lt;ref name="evil"/&gt;

Bellfield was seen driving around in his van, talking to young girls at bus stops, while under police surveillance.&lt;ref name="evil"/&gt; Amélie Delagrange was seen by CCTV cameras which showed her walking towards [[Twickenham]] Green after she missed her stop on the bus home.&lt;ref name="evil"/&gt; She may have stopped and spoken to Bellfield between the last two sightings of her.  She was attacked shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="evil"/&gt;

Bellfield was arrested early on the morning of 22 November 2004 on suspicion of the murder of Amélie Delagrange. On 25 November, he was charged of three counts of rape in Surrey and West London. On 9 December 2004, he was charged with assaulting a woman in Twickenham between 1995 and 1997 and remanded in custody. Bellfield was rearrested and charged with Amélie Delagrange's murder on 2 March 2006, along with the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy and the attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm to Irma Dragoshi. On 25 May 2006 Bellfield was charged with the murder of Marsha McDonnell.

==Victims==

===Milly Dowler===
{{main|Murder of Milly Dowler}}
Amanda Jane "Milly" Dowler was a 13-year-old girl who went missing on leaving the [[Walton-on-Thames railway station|railway station in Walton-on-Thames]] on 21 March 2002 and was found dead in Yateley Heath Woods, [[Yateley]], six months later. In August 2009, [[Surrey Police]] submitted a dossier to the [[Crown Prosecution Service|CPS]] containing evidence of Bellfield's involvement in the murder of Dowler. On 30 March 2010, Bellfield was charged with the [[kidnap]] and [[murder]] of Milly, as well as the attempted kidnap of then 12-year-old Rachel Cowles on 20 March 2002.&lt;ref name="times_dowler_charge"&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article7081126.ece|title=Levi Bellfield to be charged with Milly Dowler murder|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=30 March 2010|accessdate=30 March 2010 | location=London | first=Steve | last=Bird}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellfield refused to give evidence at his trial and always denied any involvement in Dowler's death. A jury convicted Bellfield of Dowler's murder on 23 June 2011.&lt;ref name="bbc_dowler"/&gt; 

===Marsha McDonnell===
Marsha Louise McDonnell, a 19-year-old woman, died in hospital, two days after being admitted, as a result of being beaten over the head with a blunt instrument near her home in [[Hampton, London]], in February 2003. The wound was inflicted shortly after she got off the [[London Buses route 111|111 bus]] from [[Kingston upon Thames]] at the stop on Percy Road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2731467.stm Student's death 'was murder'] 6 February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Bellfield sold his [[Vauxhall Corsa]] car for £1,500 six days after the murder, having bought it for £6,000 just five months earlier.&lt;ref name="times_timeline"/&gt;

===Kate Sheedy===
Kate Sheedy, then aged 18, was run over as she crossed the road near an entrance to an industrial estate in [[Isleworth]] on 28 May 2004. She survived, but suffered multiple injuries and spent several weeks in hospital. Nearly four years later, she gave evidence against Bellfield when he was tried with her [[attempted murder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3778029.stm |title = Hit-and-run student phoned mother | date= 4 June 2004| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amélie Delagrange===
Amélie Delagrange was a 22-year-old [[French people|French]] student visiting the UK. She was found at [[Twickenham|Twickenham Green]] on the evening of 19 August 2004 with serious head injuries, and died in hospital the same night. Within 24 hours, the police established that she might have been killed by the same person who had killed Marsha McDonnell 18 months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3582958.stm Murder police probe Marsha 'link'] 20 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Bellfield reportedly confessed to the murder while on remand.&lt;ref name="times_timeline"/&gt;

===Charges of abduction and attempted murder===
Bellfield was also charged with [[Kidnapping|abduction]] and [[false imprisonment]] of Anna-Maria Rennie (then aged 17) at [[Whitton, London|Whitton]] on 14 October 2001, after she identified him in a video identity parade four years later. He was also charged with the [[attempted murder]] of Irma Dragoshi (then aged 39) at [[Longford, London|Longford]] on 16 December 2003. The jury failed to reach verdicts on either of these charges.&lt;ref name="times_timeline"/&gt;

==Conviction and imprisonment==
Bellfield was found guilty of the murders of Marsha McDonnell and Amélie Delagrange (as well as the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy) on 25 February 2008 more than three years after the last of the three attacks. The following day, he was sentenced to life imprisonment [[Whole life tariff|with a recommendation that he should never be released]].&lt;ref name="Bellfield_tariff"&gt;{{cite news | title=Bellfield given 'whole life' term | date=26 February 2008 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7264138.stm | work =BBC News | accessdate = 14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellfield was not in court to hear his sentence, as he had refused to attend court owing to "unfair press coverage" following his conviction.

On 30 March 2010, Bellfield was charged with Dowler's abduction and murder, pre-dating the earliest of the other three charges by almost a year. Milly was 13 years old when last seen alive on her way home from school in [[Walton-on-Thames]] on 21 March 2002; her body was found in woodland near [[Yateley]], [[Hampshire]], six months later. Bellfield was named as the prime suspect in connection with the murder in the immediate aftermath of his trial in 2008.&lt;ref name="charge"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article7081126.ece|title=Levi Bellfield to be charged with Milly Dowler murder|work=[[The Times]]|date=4 August 2009|accessdate=9 October 2010 | location=London | first=Steve | last=Bird}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the inquest into the death was adjourned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23831491-levi-bellfield-trial-delays-milly-dowler-inquest.do |title=Levi Bellfield trial delays Milly Dowler inquest |work=[[London Evening Standard]] |date=7 May 2010 |accessdate=8 October 2010 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516154328/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23831491-levi-bellfield-trial-delays-milly-dowler-inquest.do |archivedate=16 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 6 October 2010 he appeared in court via video link and was formally charged with one count each of attempted [[Kidnapping|abduction]], (actual) abduction, disposal of evidence{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and [[Murder in English law|murder]].

Bellfield's second trial began at the [[Old Bailey]] on 10 May 2011&lt;ref name=blink&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8506314/Levi-Bellfield-trial-a-blink-of-the-eye-and-Milly-Dowler-was-gone.html|title= Levi Bellfield trial: a blink of the eye and Milly Dowler was gone|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=11 May 2011|accessdate=14 May 2011|first=Caroline|last=Gammell|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 23 June 2011 the jury found Bellfield guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13875507 | title = Levi Bellfield guilty of Milly Dowler murder| date= 23 June 2011 | accessdate = 23 June 2011 | publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was again sentenced to life imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13903710 | title = Levi Bellfield trial jury discharged| date= 24 June 2011 | accessdate = 24 June 2011 | publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following day and the trial judge recommended that his life sentence should mean life – just as the judge at his trial for the other crimes had done three years earlier. The trial of Bellfield on another charge of attempted abduction of Rachel Cowles, an 11-year-old girl offered a lift in the Walton area by a man in a red car on the day preceding this murder, was abandoned due to newspapers publishing prejudicial material,&lt;ref name=guardian-20110627&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/jun/27/milly-dowler-parents-family-levi-bellfield |title=The Dowler family's ordeal is no case for silent witnesses |author=Joshua Rozenberg |date=27 June 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=28 June 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the judge ordered that the charge should remain on file.&lt;ref name=guardian-20110624&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/jun/24/medialaw-judiciary |title=Were the media wrong to report on serial murderer Bellfield? |author=Roy Greenslade |date=24 June 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=28 June 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 January 2016, Surrey Police announced that Bellfield had admitted, for the first time, abducting, raping and murdering Dowler, after being interviewed about whether he had an accomplice.&lt;ref name="BBC News 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Levi Bellfield admits Milly Dowler murder | website=BBC News | date=27 January 2016 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35419507 | accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levi Bellfield later issued a denial that he made any such confession, but  Surrey Police stood by their earlier statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/12/levi-bellfield-denies-confessing-to-milly-dowlers|title=Levi Bellfield denies confessing to Milly Dowler's murder|work=The Guardian|date=12 February 2016|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Links to other crimes==
After his February 2008 convictions, Bellfield was named by police as a suspect in connection with numerous unsolved murders and attacks on women dating back to 1990 – as well as the murder of his childhood girlfriend, 14-year-old Patsy Morris in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/he-murdered-two-how-many-more-did-bellfield-target-1.875373|title=He murdered two... how many more did Bellfield target?|work=Herald Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police were informed in early 2015 that Bellfield, in his cell at [[HM Prison Wakefield]], had admitted to unsolved rape and murder cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/09/no-evidence-to-link-levi-bellfield-to-fresh-crimes-says-met-police|title=No evidence to link Levi Bellfield to fresh crimes, says Met police|work=The Guardian|date=9 November 2016|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Metropolitan Police co-ordinated the subsequent investigations of 10 police forces. On 9 November 2016, they issued a statement which said: "All lines of inquiry have now been exhausted and the decision has been taken to close this investigation as there is no evidence to link the individual to any case for which he has not already been convicted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37926858|title=Levi Bellfield: 'No link' to other crimes found by inquiry|publisher=BBC News|date=9 November 2016|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed by police that Bellfield may have lied about other murders so he could inflict pain on their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/serial-killer-levi-bellfield-lied-9236492|title=Serial killer Levi Bellfield may have lied about other murders to hurt victims' families|work=The Mirror|last=Pettifor|first=Tom|date=10 November 2016|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Lim Kit Siang series}}
'''Lim Kit Siang''' ({{zh|c=林吉祥|p=Lín jíxiáng|poj=Lîm Kiat-siâng}}; born 20 February 1941) is a Malaysian politician and party leader. He is a prominent leader of the [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP), a component party of the current ruling [[Pakatan Harapan]] (PH) coalition in [[Malaysia]]. He had previously served as the [[Leader of the Opposition (Malaysia)|Opposition Leader of Malaysia]] for 1 year (1973-1974), another 24 years (1975-1999) before assuming the role again for a four-year stint from 2004-2008.

==Personal==
Lim was educated from [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1977. He is married with four children. Since 1978, he has authored 34 books.&lt;ref name=biodata/&gt; His son [[Lim Guan Eng]] is the current [[Minister of Finance (Malaysia)|Finance Minister of Malaysia]] and a former [[Chief Minister of Penang]].

===Ancestry===
Lim Kit Siang together with his son Lim Guan Eng first visited his ancestral home in China in Nov 2008 (reported in Chinapress). His ancestral village is located in [[Zhangzhou]], Fujian province which makes him a Minnan native. He met his brother-in-law during the visit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinchew.com.my/node/91953?tid=43 與家人福建尋根‧冠英“還鄉”百感交集], 2008-11-26, [[Sin Chew Daily]] (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

His birthplace was questioned by Pertubuhan Minda Sosial Prihatin (PMSP) president Ramesh Rao, who noticed Lim's Wikipedia page stated that he arrived in Malaya in 1957. Lim was infuriated when asked by the press, where he told the reporters to do their own research before asking him such question, adding that he felt sorry for the journalist.
.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nst.com.my/news/politics/2017/08/263700/kit-siang-unhappy-when-bombarded-questions-birth-place Kit Siang unhappy when bombarded with questions on birth place]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

===Member of Parliament===
Lim first emerged as a politician when he was National Organising Secretary of the DAP from 1966 to 1969. At the same time he was also entrusted to edit the party's newspaper, the ''Rocket''. The course of the political landscape changed when he was promoted to Secretary-General in 1969 after being acting Secretary-General for a short period during a turbulent period in the country's history. He considers himself a [[democratic socialist]] and is also a supporter of [[social democracy]].

Lim was first elected as an MP for the Bandar Melaka seat in 1969. His election was initially held to be void, however, because the law prohibited an election agent who had previously failed to discharge his duties from standing for election in the future. The [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], [[Tun Abdul Razak]], moved a motion in Parliament to prevent Lim from serving as an MP, granting him instead a period of time to request a royal pardon from the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (King). After receiving the royal pardon, Lim was allowed to retain his seat.&lt;ref name="election snafu"&gt;Rahman, Rashid A. (1994). ''The Conduct of Elections in Malaysia'', pp. 204–205. Kuala Lumpur: Berita Publishing. {{ISBN|967-969-331-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from 1999 to 2004, during which time he lost his seat due to the Chinese disenchantment with DAP entering into a political pact with the Islamist [[PAS (political party)|PAS]] for the general elections, Lim represented various constituencies in five states:
* [[Malacca City|Bandar Melaka]] (1969–1974)
* Kota Melaka (1974–1978)
* [[Petaling, Selangor|Petaling]], Selangor (1978–1982)
* Kota Melaka (1982–1986)
* [[George Town, Penang|Tanjong]], Penang (1986–1999)
* [[Ipoh|Ipoh Timor]], Perak (2004–2013)
* [[Gelang Patah]], Johor (since 2013)

He also served as a state assemblyman in [[Melaka]] and [[Penang]] during the following periods: Kubu, Melaka (1974–1982); Kampong Kolam, Penang (1986–1990); and Padang Kota, Penang (1990–1995).

In addition, Lim Kit Siang has also served as the [[Leader of the Opposition (Malaysia)|Opposition Leader of Malaysia]] three times over a span of 29 years. He was first elected Opposition Leader for an 18-month stint from January 1973 to July 1974. Next, he assumed the position in November 1975 for the next 24 years before he lost his parliamentary seat in the [[Malaysian general election, 1999|1999 general elections]]. He served in the post once more for a four-year stint following the [[Malaysian general election, 2004|2004 general elections]] until 2008.

He led the party in the capacity of Secretary-General until 1999 when he was elected party chairman, succeeding [[Chen Man Hin]]. In 2004, he refused re-appointment as the chairman and [[Karpal Singh]] was elected to replace him. Lim was then elected to an advisory role as the leader of a newly created body called the "Policy and Strategic Planning Commission". His son, [[Lim Guan Eng]], is currently the Secretary-General of the party and was the [[Minister of Finance (Malaysia)|Finance Minister of Malaysia]].

After winning a parliamentary seat from Ipoh Timor during the [[Malaysian general election, 2004|2004 general election]], which also saw his party clinching the most seats of any opposition party, Lim became the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Parliamentary Opposition Leader]]. In recent years the opposition have been campaigning for freer and fairer elections within Malaysia. On 10 November 2007, a mass rally, called the [[2007 Bersih Rally|BERSIH Peaceful People's Gathering]], took place in the [[Dataran Merdeka]] Kuala Lumpur at 3pm to demand for clean and fair elections. The gathering was organised by BERSIH, a coalition comprising political parties and civil society groups, and drew supporters from all over the country.

In the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|March 2008 general election]], he was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Ipoh Timor with a majority of 21,942 votes.

Lim contested and won in Gelang Patah against Barisan Nasional's heavyweight and former [[Menteri Besar of Johor]] [[Abdul Ghani Othman|Datuk Abdul Ghani]] in the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013 general election]]. He called this election the "dirtiest ever GE in Malaysian history" and has called for a "clean" election.{{citation needed |date=October 2014}}

===Detention without trial===
In 1969 Kit Siang was detained under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] for 18 months. Ten years later, in 1979, he was convicted of five charges under Official Secrets Act for exposing an inappropriate arms deal between the government and a Swiss company.

Lim was one of the people arrested during "[[Operation Lalang]]" in 1987. He spent 17 months in prison under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]],&lt;ref name=biodata&gt;[http://limkitsiang.com/biodata.htm Lim Kit Siang: Biodata]&lt;/ref&gt; which allows for two years of detention without trial at the pleasure of the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Home Minister]]. The two-year sentence may, in practice, be extended indefinitely without any avenues for [[due process]] or appeal.

==Controversy==
Lim is a controversial figure for his strongly held views about Malaysian politics; some, such as Malay Malaysian writer Bakri Musa, have labelled him and fellow DAP leader [[Karpal Singh]] as racial provocateurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Musa |first=M. Bakri |title=Towards A Competitive Malaysia |year=2007 |publisher=Strategic Information and Research Development Centre |location=Petaling Jaya |isbn=978-983-3782-20-8|pages=79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, after winning 12th general election, Lim Kit Siang issued an instruction for all DAP representatives to stay away from the swearing-in ceremony for Perak Menteri Besar, claiming that there was no DAP CEC mandate for PAS Menteri Besar in Perak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.limkitsiang.com/2008/03/12/no-dap-cec-mandate-for-pas-menteri-besar-in-perak/ No DAP CEC mandate for PAS Menteri Besar in Perak.]&lt;/ref&gt; This caused the Perak MB swearing-in ceremony to be cancelled and&lt;ref&gt;http://thestar.com.my/election/story.asp?file=/2008/3/13/election2008/20080313171328&amp;sec=Election2008{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Perak MB swearing-in ceremony cancelled (updated)&lt;/ref&gt; only took place after Lim Kit Siang apologised and retracted his instruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=320904 Swearing-in of Perak MB Tomorrow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406000844/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=320904 |date=6 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Samy Vellu and the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal ===

In 1992, Lim Kit Siang was suspended from Parliament for eight months for calling on the then Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] to present a White Paper in Parliament on the outcome of ACA re-opening of investigations into the MIC President and the Minister for Energy, Posts and Telecommunications, Datuk Seri S. [[Samy Vellu]] and the MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibliotheca.limkitsiang.com/1994/09/29/dap-calls-on-the-prime-minister-to-present-a-white-paper-in-next-month%e2%80%99s-parliament-on-the-outcome-of-aca-re-opening-of-investigations-into-samy-vellu-and-the-maika-telekom-shares-hijacking-sc/ MAIKA Telekom shares hijacking scandal]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maria Osmarina Marina Silva Vaz de Lima'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senado.gov.br/senadores/dinamico/paginst/senador59a.asp|title=Home - Senado Federal|website=www.senado.gov.br|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 8 February 1958) is a Brazilian politician and environmentalist. She is currently the spokeswoman for the [[Sustainability Network|Sustainability Party]] (REDE). During her political career, Silva served as a Senator of the state of [[Acre (state)|Acre]] between 1995 and 2011 and Minister of the Environment from 2003 to 2008. She ran for president in 2010, 2014 and 2018.

Born in a rubber plantation in [[Acre (state)|Acre]], Marina moved to the state capital [[Rio Branco, Acre|Rio Branco]] as a teenager, where she became literate. After graduating high school, she completed her undergraduate degree in History from the [[Federal University of Acre]] at 26. She developed an interest in politics and joined the Communist Revolutionary Party, a Marxist organization that was housed in the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers Party (PT)]], later helping to found the Central Workers' Union of Acre. She helped [[Chico Mendes]] to lead the trade union movement, being elected as councillor of Rio Branco in 1988 for her first mandate in a public office.   

Silva was a member of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|PT]] until 2009, and served as a Senator before becoming Minister of the Environment in 2003. She ran for president in the [[Brazilian presidential election, 2010|2010 Brazilian elections]] as the candidate for the [[Green Party (Brazil)|Green Party (PV)]], coming in 3rd with 19% of the first-round vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://placar.eleicoes.uol.com.br/2010/1turno/|title=Eleições 2010 – Apuração|publisher=uol.com.br|language=Portuguese|year=2010|accessdate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, [[Eduardo Campos]] announced his candidacy for the fall [[Brazilian general election, 2014|2014 presidential election]], naming Marina Silva as his vice presidential candidate.&lt;ref name="CamposMarinaElec"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-27029256|title=Campos-Silva in Brazil 2014 election|date=14 April 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 September 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Campos's death in a plane crash on August, she was selected to run as the [[Brazilian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]]'s candidate for the Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/marina-silva-obvious-successor-after-campos-death|title=Marina Silva emerges as obvious successor after Campos death|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Jonathan Watts|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first round of the October 2014 election, she won 21% of the vote (less than many of the opinion polls had predicted), coming in 3rd and failing to advance to the run-off.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-29501500|title=Brazil election: Dilma Rousseff to face Aecio Neves in run-off|editor=BBC|date=6 October 2014|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second round, she supported [[PSDB]] candidate [[Aécio Neves]] over [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|PT]] incumbent [[Dilma Rousseff]]. She is running for president again in the [[Brazilian general election, 2018|2018 election]], this time under the Sustainability Network.

Silva has won a number of awards from US and international organizations in recognition of her environmental activism. In 1996, Silva won the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] for South &amp; Central America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/recipient/marina-silva/|title=Marina Silva - Goldman Environmental Foundation|work=Goldman Environmental Foundation|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the United Nations Environment Program named her one of the [[Champions of the Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/championsofearth/laureates/2007/he-marina-silva|title=H.E Marina Silva {{!}} Champions of the Earth|website=www.unep.org|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2009 [[Sophie Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-environment-prize/brazilian-forest-conservationist-silva-wins-norway-prize-idUKTRE5305MJ20090401|title=Brazilian forest conservationist Silva wins Norway prize|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.K.|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, Marina Silva was elected by the British ''[[Financial Times]]'' newspaper as one of its ''Women of the Year''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/57610270-7f9c-11e4-adff-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3LnyrLN1v|title=Women of 2014: Marina Silva, presidential candidate|date=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silva is also a member of [[Washington, D.C.]]-based think tank, the [[Inter-American Dialogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedialogue.org/experts/marina-silva/|title=Inter-American Dialogue {{!}}   Marina Silva|website=www.thedialogue.org|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, she, along with [[Cécile Duflot]], [[Monica Frassoni]], [[Elizabeth May]] and [[Renate Künast]], were named by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine to its list of top global thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/29/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,30 Top 100] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018134430/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/29/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,30|date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for taking [[Green politics|Green]] mainstream. In 2012 she was one of eight people chosen to carry the flag for the opening ceremonies of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/media/press/2012/liberty-director-carries-the-olympic-flag-in-opening-cer.php|title=Liberty Director carries the Olympic Flag in opening ceremony|date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
[[File:Marina Silva em Xapuri 02.jpg|thumb|left|Marina Silva in [[Xapuri]], Acre]]
[[File:Marina Silva em Xapuri 01.jpg|thumb|left|Silva in [[Amazon rainforest]], Acre]]
Marina Silva was born '''Maria Osmarina da Silva''' in the small village of Breu Velho, 70&amp;nbsp;km outside [[Rio Branco, Acre]]. Silva is a descendant of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Black people|black African]] ancestors in both her maternal and paternal lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EMI88634-15223,00.html Marina Silva deixa o PT] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of eleven children in a community of [[Rubber tapping|rubber tappers]] on the ''Bagaço'' rubber tree plantation ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Seringal Bagaço''), in the western state of [[Acre (state)|Acre]]. Growing up, she survived five bouts of malaria in addition to cases of hepatitis and metal poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/3149004/the-green-activist-who-might-become-brazils-next-president/ |title=The Green Activist Who Might Become Brazil's Next President |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=20 August 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ea83371c-26b4-11e4-bc19-00144feabdc0|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orphaned at age 16, young Marina moved to the state capital, Rio Branco, to study and receive treatment for hepatitis. She was taken in by nuns in a convent and received a Catholic education. There, she became the first person in her family to learn to read and write. After leaving the convent, she went to work as a housemaid in exchange for lodging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-28865958|title=Tragedy puts Marina Silva at heart of Brazil campaign|first=Julia|last=Carneiro|date=21 August 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 September 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She completed her undergraduate degree in History from the [[Federal University of Acre]] at 26 and became increasingly politically active. In 1984 Silva helped create Acre's first workers' union.&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=Tom |url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/summary/2115--I-d-lost-the-strength-to-carry-on- |title=I'd lost the strength to carry on |publisher=[[chinadialogue]] |date=20 June 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005181454/http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/summary/2115--I-d-lost-the-strength-to-carry-on- |archivedate=5 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She led demonstrations called ''empates'' with [[Chico Mendes]] to warn against [[deforestation]] and the outplacement of forest communities from their traditional locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/162 |title=Marina Silva |publisher=The Goldman Environmental Prize |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821103758/http://goldmanprize.org/node/162 |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Silva as a Senator ==
In 1994, Ms. Silva was the first rubber tapper ever elected to the [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]]. As a native Amazonian and a senator, she built support for environmental protection of the reserves as well as for social justice and [[sustainable development]] in the [[Amazon region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/162 |title=Marina Silva |accessdate=2008-08-08 |publisher=The Goldman Environmental Prize |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821103758/http://goldmanprize.org/node/162 |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Deforestation decreased by 59% from 2004 to 2007, during which she implemented an integrated government policy. It simultaneously fostered sustainable development, favored territorial zoning, and attached greater value to standing forests. It also incorporated elements from international conventions and documents.&lt;ref name="Embassy of Brazil in London"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brazil.org.uk/environment/deforestation.html |title=Fall in Amazon deforestation rates (2004–2007) |accessdate=2008-08-08 |publisher=Embassy of Brazil in London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006034747/http://www.brazil.org.uk/environment/deforestation.html |archivedate=6 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "All of this demonstrates that, when there is integrated planning and effort, it is truly possible to change the picture," Silva said in a statement to the Embassy of Brazil in London.&lt;ref name="Embassy of Brazil in London" /&gt;

== Lula's minister ==
A member of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]], Marina Silva was appointed Environment Minister by [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula]] in his first term (2003). She remained in office until 2008 and received several criticisms from entrepreneurs (mainly related to [[agribusiness]]) on account of delays in granting permits for projects with large environmental impact. In early 2005, however, she stated that she would not give up upon facing challenges even if imposed by the government to which she belonged, like the controversy over the [[São Francisco River|São Francisco River Diversion Project]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/8575010.stm|title=Brazil's huge river diversion project divides opinion|author=Henry Mance|publisher=BBC News|date=12 April 2010|accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the building of the BR-163 highway through the [[rainforest]]: "I don't admit defeat, just challenges that must be overcome".&lt;ref name="IPS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsterraviva.net/tv/wsf2005/viewstory.asp?idnews=146|title=ENVIRONMENT – THE FRAGILE BALANCE OF A MINISTRY|last=Wodianer Marcondes|first=Adalberto|publisher=[[Inter Press Service]]|date=29 January 2005|accessdate=2010-07-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713170317/http://www.ipsterraviva.net/TV/WSF2005/viewstory.asp?idnews=146|archivedate=13 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2005, Silva established her main lines of action for the next two years: social participation, [[sustainable development]], creation of a National Environmental System, and an Integrated Environmental Policy. As she said, "Our ministry is new. It's only 13 years old, and it needs to be rebuilt".&lt;ref name="IPS" /&gt;

In the same year, Silva was confronted by Paulo Adário, coordinator of [[Greenpeace]] Brazil, over her environmental actions during her tenure in the ministry. Ever since her tenure began, Ms. Silva, together with the [[Federal Police (Brazil)|Federal Police]], the [[Brazilian Army]] and the [[Federal Highway Police]], performed 32 operations against illegal [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon]]. But Adário claims that his organization monitors the Amazon region and that only one such operation was conducted in October 2004, in the town of [[Itaituba]], Pará. According to him, even if the 32 operations had actually been carried out, it would represent only half of what was anticipated in the National Plan to Combat Deforestation.&lt;ref name="IPS" /&gt;

== Resignation ==

Silva resigned from the Lula government in May 2008. She was replaced by [[Carlos Minc]].&lt;ref name="Barrionuevo"&gt;{{cite news |last=Barrionuevo |first=Alexei |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/world/americas/16brazil.html?ref=world |title='Stagnation' Made Brazil's Environment Chief Resign |work=New York Times |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silva cited "the growing resistance found by our team in important sectors of the government and society" as the reason for her resignation.&lt;ref name="Phillips" /&gt; Tension between her and the rest of the Lula administration increased when President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]] chose Minister of Strategic Affairs [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]] to coordinate a sustainable development plan for the Amazon, instead of her. She had become increasingly isolated in [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]]'s government due to her views against hydroelectric dams, [[biofuels]], and genetically modified crops.&lt;ref name="Barrionuevo" /&gt;

== Party switch and 2010 presidential bid ==
[[File:Lovejoy, Silva, and Schneider.jpg|thumb|alt=Waist high portrait of three middle aged people in the library of what could be a boat or other confined space.|Silva (center) with [[Thomas Lovejoy]] and [[Stephen Schneider]]]]
On 19 August 2009, Silva announced her switch from the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] to the [[Green Party (Brazil)|Green Party]], primarily in protest against the environmental policies endorsed by the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|PT]]. Confirming the expectations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8211549.stm|title=Amazon activist eyes election bid|date=20 August 2009|publisher=|accessdate=3 September 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marina Silva launched her candidacy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/10/03/brazilian-presidential-profile-marina-silva/|title=Brazilian presidential profile: Marina Silva|date=3 October 2010|publisher=|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Brazilian presidential election, 2010|2010 election]] under the Green Party ticket on 16 May 2010 in the city of Nova Iguaçu, [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state of Rio de Janeiro]]. Silva said she wanted to be "the first black woman of poor origin" to become president of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abril.com.br/noticias/brasil/marina-silva-diz-querer-ser-primeira-mulher-negra-ser-presidente-568637.shtml Marina Silva diz querer ser primeira mulher negra a ser presidente] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716023826/http://www.abril.com.br/noticias/brasil/marina-silva-diz-querer-ser-primeira-mulher-negra-ser-presidente-568637.shtml |date=16 July 2011 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has also become a Pentecostal Christian&lt;ref name="Equal Times"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Castro |first1=Nazaret |title=The rising political power of Evangelicals in Latin America |url=https://www.equaltimes.org/the-rising-political-power-of#.W5GWKvZFxPY |website=Equal Times |accessdate=6 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CP World"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blair |first1=Leonardo |title=Devout Evangelical Christian Marina Silva Started Life Illiterate in the Amazon; Now She's Primed to Become Brazil's First Black President |url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/devout-evangelical-christian-marina-silva-started-life-illiterate-in-the-amazon-now-shes-primed-to-become-brazils-first-black-president-125539/ |website=The Christian Post |publisher=The Christian Post, INC |accessdate=6 September 2018 |language=en-US |date=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Assemblies of God]], the second largest Christian denomination in Brazil after the declining but still mainstream [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/evangelical-population-explodes-in-brazil-as-catholic-church-shows-signs-of-decline-77470/|title=Evangelical Population Explodes in Brazil as Catholic Church Shows Signs of Decline|editor=CP World|author=Andrea Madambashi|date=1 July 2012|accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulsamerica.co.uk/2012/07/02/brazil-catholic-church-on-the-decline/|title=Brazil: Catholic Church on the decline|editor=Pulsamerica|author=Benjamin Ahnert|date=2 July 2012|accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, during her election campaign, she was criticized by one of the main leaders of the Brazilian [[Assemblies of God]], Pastor [[Silas Malafaia]], after having proposed a [[referendum]] on abortion and [[Legality of cannabis|decriminalization of marijuana]]. According to Malafaia, Marina Silva should be "more courageous and consistent" in defense of her religious convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidneyrezende.com/noticia/102263|title=Pastor Silas Malafaia critica Marina Silva e vira destaque no Twitter|language=Portuguese|date=28 September 2010|accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SBT Brasil, Carlos Nascimento, Marina Silva, Karyn Bravo.jpg|thumb|left|Silva on [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão|SBT]]]]
In her campaign, Silva defended the "exercise of citizen-based political principles and values", "education for the knowledge society", "economy applied to a sustainable society", "social protection, health, welfare and 3rd generation of social programs", "[[quality of life]] and safety for all Brazilians", and "strengthening of culture and diversity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minhamarina.org.br/home/home_campanha.php|title=Marina Silva – Official Site|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2012-08-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728202331/http://www.minhamarina.org.br/home/home_campanha.php|archivedate=28 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With her speech against the endemic corruption in Brazil (see ''[[A Privataria Tucana]]'' and ''[[Mensalão scandal]]''), and in favor of sustainable development (with a due consideration to environmental issues), Silva managed to attract the middle class sectors disillusioned with the government of the [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]]'s [[Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira|PSDB]] and dissatisfied with the compensatory social policies of Lula da Silva's administration. As a result, she came to be seen as an alternative.&lt;ref name="Maciel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifch.unicamp.br/formulario_cemarx/selecao/2012/trabalhos/7355_Maciel_David.pdf|title=De Lula à Dilma Roussef: crise econômica, hegemonia neoliberal e regressão política|author=David Maciel|format=PDF|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marina Silva received strong support among young and highly educated voters. Running on a small party ticket, she had about 1/20th of the TV time compared to the other two biggest party coalitions.

The participation of Marina Silva as one of the eight invited [[flag-bearer]]s to carry the [[Olympic flag]] at the opening of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London Summer Games 2012]], took by surprise the [[Brazilian government]] representatives present at the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jconline.ne10.uol.com.br/canal/londres-2012/noticia/2012/07/28/marina-silva-causa-mal-estar-entre-ministros-em-londres-50735.php|title=Marina Silva causa mal estar entre ministros em Londres|language=Portuguese|editor=jconline.com.br|date=28 July 2012|accessdate=2012-08-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111223000/http://jconline.ne10.uol.com.br/canal/londres-2012/noticia/2012/07/28/marina-silva-causa-mal-estar-entre-ministros-em-londres-50735.php|archive-date=11 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/9437285/London-2012-Olympics-Brazilians-caught-up-in-right-royal-kerfuffle-over-Danny-Boyles-opening-ceremony.html|title=London 2012 Olympics: Brazilians caught up in right royal kerfuffle over Danny Boyle's opening ceremony|editor=telegraph.co.uk|author=Jacquelin Magnay|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/olympics/article-2180781/London-2012-Olympics-Brazilian-government-angered-flagbearer.html|title=Brazilian government angered as Amazon campaigner carries flag at opening ceremony|editor=dailymail.co.uk|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Brazilian press headlines like "Marina steals [[Dilma Rousseff|Dilma]]'s attention" appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/noblat/posts/2012/07/28/jornal-das-olimpiadas-marina-silva-rouba-cena-de-dilma-457538.asp|title=Jornal das Olimpíadas – Marina Silva rouba a cena de Dilma|editor=[[O Globo]]|language=Portuguese|date=28 July 2012|accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/politica/olimpiada-2012/marina-silva-sera-homenageada-na-abertura-da-olimpiada/|title=Marina Silva será homenageada na abertura da Olimpíada|editor=[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]|language=Portuguese|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=2012-08-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801230101/http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/politica/olimpiada-2012/marina-silva-sera-homenageada-na-abertura-da-olimpiada/|archivedate=1 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the event, [[Aldo Rebelo]], Brazilian Sports Minister from the PT, which realised it would likely lose votes to Marina in a presidential contest, said that Silva "always had good relations with the [[European aristocracy]]" and that it was the responsibility of the [[House of Windsor|Royal House]] to choose who would participate in the event.

== Sustainability Network ==
On 16 February 2013 a new party, ''Rede Sustentabilidade'' ("Sustainability Network"), was officially launched in Brasilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-21487993|title=Brazil's Marina Silva launches 'sustainability party'|editor=[[BBC News]]|date=16 February 2013|accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to its founders, the name to be used at the polls would be simply REDE ("NETWORK").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2013/02/novo-partido-de-marina-silva-vai-se-chamar-rede-sustentabilidade.html|title=Novo partido de Marina Silva vai se chamar Rede Sustentabilidade|author=Iara Lemos|editor=[[O Globo]]|language=Portuguese|date=16 February 2013|accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 2013, the [[Supreme Electoral Court]] blocked the party's creation, there being insufficient signatures to register it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Bragon, Ranier |author2=Falcão, Márcio |title=Electoral Court Blocks Marina Silva's Party|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2013/10/1351715-electoral-court-blocks-marina-silvas-presidential-bid.shtml|accessdate= 6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Marina announced her affiliation to the [[Brazilian Socialist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazil's Marina Silva and Socialists eye 2014 elections.|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-24416480|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2014 presidential bid ==
[[File:Marina Silva e Eduardo Campos 2013.JPG|thumb|180px|With [[Eduardo Campos]].]]
In April 2014, [[Eduardo Campos]] announced his name for the [[Brazilian general election, 2014|October 2014 presidential election]], naming Marina Silva as his candidate for vice president.&lt;ref name="CamposMarinaElec" /&gt;

On Wednesday, 13 August 2014, Campos' private jet, with six others on board, crashed in bad weather as it was preparing to land in the coastal city of [[Santos, Brazil|Santos]], just south of [[São Paulo]]. After his death, Silva&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/brazil-party-chooses-marina-silva-as-presidential-candidate-1408235460|title=Brazil Party Chooses Marina Silva as Presidential Candidate|editor=WSJ|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the Brazilian Socialist Party's candidate for President of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-28822676|title=Brazil: Marina Silva 'to replace' late candidate Campos|publisher=BBC|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/08/16/uk-brazil-election-silva-idUKKBN0GG09X20140816|title=Brazil party plans to launch Marina Silva presidential bid|editor=Reuters|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after taking the place of Campos in the bid, Marina polled 20% of the votes, 10% more than Campos was polling. She enjoys strong support among young voters and evangelicals, but because of her pro-environmental stance she is largely distrusted by Brazil's powerful agribusiness sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.msn.com/world/brazil-presidential-candidate-campos-killed-in-plane-crash|title=Breaking News Stories from US and Around the World - MSN News|website=news.msn.com|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[Evangelical Christian]], she opposes [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-15/deadly-plane-crash-turns-green-evangelical-into-brazil-kingmaker.html Bloomberg: "Deadly Plane Crash Turns Evangelical Into Brazil’s Kingmaker" By Raymond Colitt and David Biller] 15 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 August 2014, Silva generated considerable controversy when she renounced the party's support for [[same-sex marriage]], which was supported by Campos and had been included in the party's manifesto, published a day earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/brazilian-presidential-candidate-drops-short-lived-gay-marriage-pledge010914-0|title=Brazilian presidential candidate drops short-lived gay marriage pledge: Marina Silva revises pro-gay government plan just one day after publication|editor=Gay Star News|date=1 September 2014|accessdate=14 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909135205/http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/brazilian-presidential-candidate-drops-short-lived-gay-marriage-pledge010914-0|archivedate=9 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, 5 October 2014, Silva received 21% of the vote in the first round of the election, to Rousseff's 41% and Neves's 34%.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; Although many observers had expected Silva to advance to a second round against Rousseff, Silva ultimately received a much lower share of the vote than most opinion polls had indicated in the lead-up to the election, and did not advance to the 26 October run-off.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; Some days after the election she endorsed Aecio Neves in the run-off against Dilma Rousseff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/brazil-election-blows-rousseff-silva-backs-rival|title=Brazil election blow for Rousseff after Silva backs rival for presidency|first=Jonathan|last=Watts|date=12 October 2014|website=the Guardian|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==2018 Presidential bid==
On 4 August 2018, Marina Silva was officially nominated as the Sustainability Network's presidential candidate in the [[Brazilian general election, 2018|2018 elections]]. Silva's running mate is [[Eduardo Jorge]] of the [[Green Party (Brazil)|Green Party]].&lt;ref&gt;https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2018/08/04/rede-confirma-candidatura-de-marina-silva-a-presidencia-da-republica.ghtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Until August 2018, Silva came in third in [[Opinion polling for the Brazilian general election, 2018|opinion polls]] for the presidency, behind [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] (whose candidacy was later barred) and [[Jair Bolsonaro]]. However, she has later been overtaken by [[Ciro Gomes]], [[Fernando Haddad]], and [[Geraldo Alckmin]], and was later polling fifth on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brazil election Coverage |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-brazil-election/ |website=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few days before the election, her poll numbers dropped significantly, and in the end she polled around a single percentage point. She came out eight with 1.0% and 1,066,893 votes.

==Political views==
Marina Silva is generally considered to be a [[Centrism|centrist]] and an [[environmentalist]].&lt;ref name="Reuters anti-graft"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics/marina-silva-counts-on-brazil-anti-graft-wave-in-threadbare-campaign-idUSKBN1JW2PE |title=Marina Silva counts on Brazil anti-graft wave in threadbare campaign |last=Paraguassu |first=Lisandra |date=July 6, 2018 |work=Reuters U.S. |access-date=2018-09-06 |publisher=Reuters |last2=Brito |first2=Ricardo |location=Brazilia |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is running on an anti-corruption platform.&lt;ref name="Reuters anti-graft" /&gt; She opposes Brazil's nuclear energy program, and wants to redistribute the nuclear energy funds in order to allocate more money towards solar and wind power.

'''Mark Abraham Bright''' (born 6 June 1962) is an English former [[Association football|footballer]] who is now a sports [[pundit]] on [[BBC Television|BBC]], [[Eurosport|British Eurosport]] and [[Al Jazeera]], as well as a coach at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].

He made the move from non-league [[Leek Town F.C.|Leek Town]] to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in 1981, where he remained for three years before he signed with [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. In 1986, he transferred to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], where he would score 92 league goals over the next six years. Joining [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in 1992, he stayed with the club for five years before moving to Swiss side [[FC Sion]] in 1997, following a short loan stay at [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. He returned to England later in 1997 to play for [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], before he announced his retirement in 1999. A [[Forward (association football)|forward]], he scored 166 goals in 461 league games throughout an 18-year career in [[the Football League]]. He played in one [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and two [[FA Cup]] finals, all of which ended in defeat. He helped Crystal Palace and Charlton Athletic to win promotion to the top-flight via the play-offs.

==Football career==
After a spell working in a factory and playing part-time at [[Cheshire County League]] outfit [[Leek Town F.C.|Leek Town]], Bright moved to [[John McGrath (footballer, born 1938)|John McGrath]]'s [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in October 1981, a club that had previously released him from their youth team at the age of 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football: Top players must lead way on ref respect, says Vale hero Bright|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Football-players-lead-way-ref-respect-says-Vale/story-15199172-detail/story.html|accessdate=11 February 2012|newspaper=[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel]]|date=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his full debut on the last day of the [[1981–82 Port Vale F.C. season|1981–82]] season, in a 2–0 win over [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] at [[Vale Park]], two weeks after coming on as a [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a goalless home draw with [[York City F.C.|York City]] on 1 May 1982.&lt;ref name="kent"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Jeff|title=Port Vale Personalities|publisher=Witan Books|page=41|year=1996|isbn=0-9529152-0-0|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Port-Vale-Personalities-Jeff-Kent/dp/0952915200}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played just once in the [[1982–83 Port Vale F.C. season|1982–83]] [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] promotion campaign, scoring Vale's second goal in a 2–0 home win over [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] on 9 October.&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt; Bright came to prominence for the "Valiants" under the stewardship of new boss [[John Rudge]] towards the end of the [[1983–84 Port Vale F.C. season|1983–84]] season, scoring ten goals in 31 games, though this was not enough to save the club from relegation out of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt; [[Graham Barnett]] advised him to reject John Rudge's offer of a two-year contract, and in June 1984 Bright was sold to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] for £33,333.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Jeff|title=Port Vale Tales: A Collection Of Stories, Anecdotes And Memories|publisher=Witan Books|date=December 1991|pages=30|isbn=0-9508981-6-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fee was later doubled due to a top-up clause.&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt;

[[Gordon Milne]]'s "Foxes" struggled in the lower half of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] table in the [[1984–85 Football League|1984–85]] and [[1985–86 Leicester City F.C. season|1985–86]] seasons. Bright scored six goals in 42 league games in his two seasons on [[Filbert Street]]. He was sold on by new manager [[Bryan Hamilton]] early in the [[1986–87 Leicester City F.C. season|1986–87]] season.

Bright was signed to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] by manager [[Steve Coppell]] for a £75,000 fee in November 1986. The "Eagles" were pressing for promotion out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], but finished two points outside the play-offs in [[1986–87 Football League|1986–87]]. He earned the Golden Boot for the highest scorer in the division in [[1987–88 Football League|1987–88]] with 24 goals, though again the club finished one place and two points outside of the play-offs.&lt;ref name="BBCPO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/sport/markbright.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202201514/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/sport/markbright.shtml |archivedate=2 February 2007 |title=Mark Bright |publisher= ''BBC Press Office''|date=April 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third-place finish in [[1988–89 Football League|1988–89]] secured them a play-off place. In the [[1989 Football League play-offs|play-offs]], he scored in the semi-final victory over [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], which helped Palace to reach the [[1989 Football League Second Division play-off Final|play-off final]]; Palace then beat [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] 4–3 on aggregate, to win promotion to the top-flight.

His 12 goals in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in [[1989–90 Football League|1989–90]] were an important part of Palace's creditable showing, and it was Bright's crashing drive at the start of the second-half that began Palace's recovery against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[FA Cup]] semi-final and ultimately helped them to get to the [[1990 FA Cup Final|final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. Their victory over Liverpool was particularly remarkable as they had [[Liverpool 9–0 Crystal Palace (1989)|lost 9–0]] at [[Anfield]] at the start of the season. After a 3–3 draw in the original tie, Palace lost 1–0 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the replay of the final.

As Palace impressed in the First Division throughout [[1990–91 Crystal Palace F.C. season|1990–91]], Bright proved his predatory skills at the highest level with a sequence of seven top-flight goals in just ten midwinter games as the "Eagles" secured their highest ever league finish of third. The potency of Bright and [[Ian Wright]]'s partnership was demonstrated on 25 September 1990, when both players scored hat-tricks in an 8–0 win over [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] at [[Selhurst Park]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]. Even after Wright had left the club Bright continued his great form for Palace, and his 17 First Division goals in [[1991–92 Crystal Palace F.C. season|1991–92]] was, at the time, a record return for a Palace striker in the top-flight; he was also the division's seventh highest scorer.

Bright left Palace for [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in September 1992 in a cash plus player exchange deal involving fellow striker [[Paul Williams (footballer, born 1965)|Paul Williams]].  He finished as the [[List of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. seasons|club's top-scorer]] for three consecutive seasons, taking pressure off club stalwart [[David Hirst (footballer)|David Hirst]]. He eventually became the "Owls" highest goalscorer in the [[Premier League]] to date, scoring 48 goals between 1992 and 1996.&lt;ref name="BBCPO" /&gt; After scoring six goals in the [[1992–93 Football League Cup|League Cup]], Bright played in the [[1993 Football League Cup Final|League Cup Final]], which ended in a 2–1 defeat to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. One of Bright's notable goals came in the [[Steel City derby|All-Sheffield]] FA Cup [[1992–93 FA Cup|semi-final in 1993]], Bright's extra-time header sealing a place in the [[1993 FA Cup Final|final]]. He fared far less well in the final itself, controversially elbowing Arsenal defender [[Andy Linighan]] in the face, causing a broken nose. Later, with the scores level in the last minute of extra time, a heavily bandaged Linighan out-jumped Bright from a corner to score the winning goal.&lt;ref name="ldd"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/7109931.New_season_will_begin_again_minus_a_Linighan/|title=New season will begin again minus a Linighan|date=11 May 2001 |work=The Northern Echo|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With 19 goals, he was Wednesday's highest scorer and the Premier League's seventh highest scorer in [[1993–94 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season|1993–94]]. He then hit 13 goals in the [[1994–95 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season|1994–95]] season, in manager [[Trevor Francis]]'s last season in charge. Bright played in the [[1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup]], scoring goals against [[Poland|Polish]] club [[Górnik Zabrze]], German side [[Karlsruher SC]], and [[Denmark|Danish]] side [[Aarhus Gymnastikforening|AGF]]. The [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] outfit then finished 15th in the league in [[1995–96 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season|1995–96]] under the stewardship of [[David Pleat]]. Bright then fell out of the first team picture in [[1996–97 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season|1996–97]], and was loaned to Second Division side [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], before joining Swiss club [[FC Sion]] in January 1997. He left soon after due to unpaid wages and issues with his transfer fee with Sheffield Wednesday.&lt;ref name="Sion"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/29210/9242320/brits-abroad-former-crystal-palace-hero-mark-bright-discusses-his-brief-stay-in-switzerland-with-fc-sion|title=Brits abroad: Former Crystal Palace hero Mark Bright discusses his brief stay in Switzerland with FC Sion|date=4 April 2014|work=Sky Sports|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright joined [[Alan Curbishley]]'s [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] towards the end of the [[1996–97 Charlton Athletic F.C. season|1996–97]] season. He helped the "Addicks" to finish fourth in the second tier in [[1997–98 Football League|1997–98]], and played in their dramatic win over [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the [[1998 Football League First Division play-off Final|1998 play off final]],&lt;ref name="BBCPO" /&gt; which was won 7–6 on [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]] after a 4–4 draw. He left [[The Valley (London)|The Valley]] and retired from professional football at the end of the [[1998–99 Charlton Athletic F.C. season|1998–99]] season.

==Media career==
After retiring, Bright became a football correspondent on ''[[The Big Breakfast]]''. He currently works on the [[BBC]] show ''[[Football Focus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/football_focus/3569255.stm|title=Mark Bright|date=25 March 2004|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also commentates on some international matches, often alongside [[Jonathan Pearce]] and [[Steve Wilson (football commentator)|Steve Wilson]] on ''[[Match of the Day]]''.&lt;ref name="BBCPO" /&gt; He is also the sports correspondent for [[BBC London News]].&lt;ref name="BBCPO" /&gt; He has also written for ''[[Match (magazine)|Match]]'' magazine, appeared on ''[[606 (radio show)|606]]'' phone-in show, ''[[Fighting Talk]]'' radio show, ''[[5 live Sport]]'' radio show, and on television programme ''[[Final Score]]''.

In 2013, Bright agreed to join the British Eurosport team to commentate on the live [[2013 Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations]] matches.

Bright featured as himself in a television advert for [[Cancer Research UK|Prostate Cancer UK]] in January 2013 alongside impressionist [[Jon Culshaw]], who featured as [[Tiziano Crudeli]].

For the 2013/14 season, Bright joined [[Al Jazeera]] as a [[pundit]] on their [[Premier League]] coverage.

==Coaching career==
In summer 2009 he joined the Crystal Palace academy set-up, along with his former teammate [[John Salako]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10323~1790306,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224075535/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10323~1790306%2C00.html |archivedate=24 February 2012 |title=Palace Legends Join Academy Set Up |publisher=Crystal Palace FC |date=11 September 2009 |accessdate=12 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bright's father was [[The Gambia|Gambian]] and his mother was English, he was raised in his mother's hometown of [[Stoke-on-Trent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Pupils-Bright-idea-African-aid-mission/story-12481558-detail/story.html|title=Former Port Vale star returns to school to help African children|date=11 June 2009|work=The Sentinel|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He met British singer and actress [[Michelle Gayle]] in 1995, the couple later married in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and in 2000 had a son they named Isaiah. They separated in 2007, though remain on good terms.

In his spare time he enjoys playing [[golf]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/jul/04/newsstory.sport3|title=Mark Bright|date=4 July 2003|work=The Guardian|accessdate=12 October 2013 | location=London | first=Dan | last=Rookwood}}&lt;/ref&gt; and riding [[Motorcycle|motorbike]]s.&lt;ref name="BBCPO" /&gt;

Bright has completed six [[half marathon]]s since his retirement in 1999, all of them in the [[Great North Run]].&lt;ref name="BBCPO" /&gt; He is also a regular competitor in the [[London Marathon]], raising funds for [[cancer research]] in 2000, the [[Willow Foundation]] in 2005 and The Rhys Daniels Trust in 2006.&lt;ref name="BBCPO" /&gt; In 2006, he starred in [[Cirque de Celebrité]], only to be the first person to be voted off. In March 2007, he scored the first goal at the new [[Wembley Stadium]] for a "Geoff Thomas Foundation Charity XI", in aid of his captain at Palace, [[Geoff Thomas (footballer, born 1964)|Geoff Thomas]]; his team won 2–0 ([[Simon Jordan]] scoring the second goal).&lt;ref name="BBCPO" /&gt;

'''Mary Edwards Walker''' (November 26, 1832 &amp;ndash; February 21, 1919), commonly referred to as '''Dr. Mary Walker''', was an American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], [[prohibition]]ist, [[prisoner of war]] and [[Surgery|surgeon]]. She was the only woman to ever receive the [[Medal of Honor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Case of Dr. Walker, Only Woman to Win (and Lose) the Medal of Honor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/04/archives/the-case-of-dr-walker-only-woman-to-win-and-lose-the-medal-of-honor.html|accessdate=January 6, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 4, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, she earned her medical degree at Syracuse Medical College in New York,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Amazons to Fighter Pilots - A Biographical Dictionary of Military Women (Volume Two)|last=Pennington|first=Reina|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2003|isbn=0-313-32708-4|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=474–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; married and started a medical practice. She volunteered with the Union Army at the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] and served as a surgeon at a temporary hospital in Washington, D.C., even though at the time women and sectarian physicians were considered unfit for the Union Army Examining Board.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiegel|first1=Allen |last2=Suskind |first2=Peter |title=Mary Edwards Walker, M.D. A Feminist Physician a Century Ahead of Her Time|journal=Journal of Community Health|date=June 1, 1996|volume=21|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was captured by Confederate forces&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; after crossing enemy lines to treat wounded civilians and arrested as a spy. She was sent as a prisoner of war to [[Richmond, Virginia]] until released in a prisoner exchange.

After the war, she was approved for the [[Medal of Honor]], for her efforts to treat the wounded during the Civil War. Notably, the award was not expressly given for gallantry in action at that time, and in fact was the only military decoration during the Civil War. Walker is the only woman to receive the medal and one of only eight civilians to receive it. Her name was deleted from the Army Medal of Honor Roll in 1917 (along with over 900 other male MOH recipients); however, it was restored in 1977.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After the war, she was a writer and lecturer supporting the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]] until her death in 1919.

==Early life and education==
Mary Edwards Walker was born in the [[Oswego (town), New York|Town of Oswego]], New York, on November 26, 1832, the daughter of Alvah (father) and Vesta (mother) Walker. She was the youngest of seven children: she had five sisters and one brother. Alvah and Vesta raised both their son and their daughters in a progressive manner that was revolutionary for the time. Their nontraditional parenting nurtured Mary's spirit of independence and sense of justice that she actively demonstrated throughout her life. While they were devoted Christians, the Walkers were "free thinkers" who raised their children to question the regulations and restrictions of various denominations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dr. Mary Walker: American Radical, 1832–1919|last = Harris|first = Sharon M.|publisher = Rutgers University Press|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-8135-4611-7|location = Piscataway, NJ|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walker parents also demonstrated non-traditional gender roles to their children regarding sharing work around the farm: Vesta often participated in heavy labor while Alvah took part in general household chores.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Walker worked on her family farm as a child. She did not wear women's clothing during farm labor because she considered it too restricting. Her mother reinforced her views that corsets and tight lacings were unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Graf, 2010, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Her elementary education consisted of attendance at the local school that her parents had started. The Walkers were determined that their daughters be as well-educated as their son, so they founded the first free schoolhouse in Oswego in the late 1830s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After finishing primary school, Mary and two of her older sisters attended Falley Seminary in Fulton, New York.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Falley was not only an institution of higher learning, but a place that emphasized modern social reform in gender roles, education, and hygiene.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Its ideologies and practices further cemented Mary's determination to defy traditional feminine standards on a principle of injustice. In her free time, Mary would pore over her father's medical texts on anatomy and physiology; her interest in medicine is attributable to her exposure to medical literature at an early age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a young woman, she taught at a school in Minetto, New York, eventually earning enough money to pay her way through Syracuse Medical College, where she graduated with honors as a medical doctor in 1855, the only woman in her class.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She married a fellow medical school student, Albert Miller, on November 16, 1855, shortly before she turned 23.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Walker wore a short skirt with trousers underneath, refused to include "obey" in her vows, and retained her last name, all characteristic of her obstinate nonconformity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They set up a joint practice in [[Rome, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Graf, 2010, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The practice did not flourish, as female physicians were generally not trusted or respected at that time.&lt;ref name=Walker26-27&gt;Walker, 2010, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; They later divorced, on account of Miller's infidelity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Yankee Women: Gender battles in the Civil War|last = Leonard|first = Elizabeth D.|publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year = 1994|isbn = 0-393-31372-7|location = New York, New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker briefly attended Bowen Collegiate Institute (later named [[Lenox College]]) in [[Hopkinton, Iowa]], in 1860, until she was suspended for refusing to resign from the school's debating society, which until she joined had been all male.

== Dress reform ==
Inspired by her parents' novel standard of dressing for health purposes, Walker was infamous for contesting traditional female wardrobe. In 1871, she wrote, "The greatest sorrows from which women suffer to-day are those physical, moral, and mental ones, that are caused by their unhygienic manner of dressing!"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She strongly opposed women's long skirts with numerous petticoats, not only for their discomfort and their inhibition to the wearer's mobility but for their collection and spread of dust and dirt.  As a young woman, she began experimenting with various skirt-lengths and layers, all with men's trousers underneath. By 1861, her typical ensemble included trousers with suspenders under a knee-length dress with a tight waist and full skirt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While encouraged by her family, Walker's wardrobe choices were often met with criticism. Once, while a schoolteacher, she was assaulted on her way home by a neighboring farmer and a group of boys, who chased her and attacked her with eggs and other missiles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Female colleagues in medical school criticized her choices, and patients often gawked at her and teased her. She nevertheless persisted in her mission to reform women's dress. Her view that women's dress should "protect the person, and allow freedom of motion and circulation, and not make the wearer a slave to it" made her commitment to dress reform as great as her zeal for abolitionism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She famously wrote to the women's journal, ''The Sibyl: A Review of the Tastes, Errors, and Fashions of Society'', about her campaign against women's fashion, amongst other things, for its injuries to health, its expense, and its contribution to the dissolution of marriages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her literature contributed to the spread of her ideas, and made her a popular figure amongst other  feminists and woman physicians. 

In 1870, Dr. Walker was arrested in New Orleans and mocked by men because she was dressed as a man. The arresting officer Mullahy twisted her arm and asked her if she had ever had sex with a man. Dr. Walker was released from custody when she was recognized at Police Court. New Orleans Republican February 22, 23, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;This incident was also cited by Perry Young in the ''Mistick Krewe, Chronicles of Comus and His Kin'', 1931, page 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Civil War==
Despite having kept a private practice for many years, Walker volunteered at the outbreak of [[American Civil War]] as a surgeon - first for the Army, but was rejected because she was a woman. She was offered the role of a nurse but declined and chose to volunteer as a surgeon for the [[Union Army]] as a civilian. The U.S. Army had no female surgeons, and at first, she was allowed to practice only as a nurse.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; During this period, she served at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (Manassas), July 21, 1861, and at the Patent Office Hospital in [[Washington, D.C.]] She worked as an unpaid field surgeon near the Union front lines, including at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] and in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] after the [[Battle of Chickamauga]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tsui|first=Bonnie|title=She Went to the Field: Women Soldiers of the Civil War|location=Guilford|publisher=TwoDot|date=2006|ISBN=0762743840|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a suffragist, she was happy to see women serving as soldiers, and alerted the press to the case of [[Frances Hook]], in Ward 2 of the Chattanooga hospital, a woman who served in the Union forces disguised as a man.&lt;ref&gt;Blanton, DeAnne, and Lauren M. Cook.  ''They Fought Like Demons: Women Soldiers in the American Civil War''. Baton Rouge, Louisiana State University Press, 2002, page 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Walker was the first female surgeon of the Union army.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; She wore men's clothing during her work, claiming it to be easier for high demands of her work.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In September 1862, Walker wrote to the War Department requesting employment as a spy, but her proposal was declined.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, RG108, E22, M1635, Mary E. Walker to Edwin M. Stanton, September 22, 1862&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1863, she was employed as a "Contract Acting Assistant Surgeon (civilian)" by the [[Army of the Cumberland]], becoming the first female surgeon employed by the U.S. Army Surgeon.&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{Cite book |accessdate=February 11, 2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BIuvXw6ky1AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Mary+Edwards+Walker%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |author=Walker, Dale L. |title= Mary Edwards Walker: Above and Beyond |work= American Heroes Series |publisher= Macmillan |year= 2005 |isbn=978-0-7653-1065-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker was later appointed assistant surgeon of the [[52nd Ohio Infantry]]. During her service, she frequently crossed battle lines and treated civilians.

On April 10, 1864, she was captured by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] troops, and arrested as a spy, just after she finished helping a Confederate doctor perform an amputation. She was sent to [[Castle Thunder (prison)|Castle Thunder]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]], and remained there until August 12, 1864, when she was released as part of a [[prisoner exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;Massey, 1994, pp 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; While she was imprisoned, she refused to wear the clothes provided her, said to be more "becoming of her sex". Walker was exchanged for a Confederate surgeon from Tennessee on August 12, 1864.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

She went on to serve as supervisor of a female prison in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and as the head of an [[orphanage]] in [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;

==Later career==
[[File:Mary edwards walker.jpg|thumb|upright|Walker, c. 1870. She often wore masculine clothes.|alt=A black and white image of Mary Walker wearing a suit and standing facing the camera with her right hand tucked into her jacket.]]

After the war, Walker was awarded a disability pension for partial muscular atrophy suffered while she was imprisoned by the enemy. She was given $8.50 a month, beginning June 13, 1865, but in 1899 that amount was raised to $20 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiegel|first1=Allen|last2=Suskind|first2=Peter|title=Mary Edwards Walker, M.D: A Feminist Physician a Century Ahead of Her Time|journal=Journal of Community Health|date=1 June 1996|volume=21|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became a writer and lecturer, supporting such issues as [[health care]], [[Temperance movement|temperance]], [[women's rights]], and [[dress reform]] for women. She was frequently arrested for wearing men's clothing, and insisted on her right to wear clothing that she thought appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Massey, 1994, pp 360–361&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote two books that discussed women's rights and dress. She replied to criticism of her attire: "I don't wear men's clothes, I wear my own clothes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lineberry|first1=Cate|title='I Wear My Own Clothes'|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/02/i-wear-my-own-clothes/|accessdate=October 22, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker was a member of the central woman's suffrage Bureau in Washington, and solicited funds to endow a chair for a woman professor at Howard University medical school.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; She attempted to register to vote in 1871, but was turned away. The initial stance of the movement, following her lead, was to claim that women already had the right to vote, and Congress needed only to enact enabling legislation. After a number of fruitless years advocating this position, the movement promoted the adoption of a [[constitutional amendment]]. This was diametrically opposed to her position, and she fell out of favor with the movement. She continued to attend suffrage conventions and distribute her own literature, but was virtually ignored by the rest of the movement. Her penchant for wearing masculine clothing, including a top hat, only exacerbated the situation.{{clarify|date=March 2016}}&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; She received a more favorable reception in England than in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Massey, 1994, p 361&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Walker published "Crowning Constitutional Argument", in which she argued that some States, as well as the federal Constitution, had already granted women the right to vote. She testified on women's suffrage before committees of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1912 and 1914.

After a long illness, Walker died at home on February 21, 1919, at the age of eighty-six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr. Mary Walker, Crusader, is Dead|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/02/23/97077779.pdf |accessdate=October 22, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 23, 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried at Rural Cemetery in [[Oswego, New York]], in a plain funeral, with an American flag draped over her casket, and wearing a black suit instead of a dress.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 49247). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Her death in 1919 came one year before the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which guaranteed women the right to vote.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;

==Honors and awards==

===Medal of Honor===
[[File:Dr Mary Edwards Walker man's top coat and hat c 1911.jpg|thumb|Mary Edwards Walker, around 1911.]]
After the war, Walker sought a retroactive brevet or commission to validate her service. President Johnson directed Secretary of War Edwin Stanton to study the legality of the issue, and he solicited an opinion from the Army's Judge Advocate General, who determined that there was no precedent for commissioning a female, but that a "commendatory acknowledgment" could be issued in lieu of the commission. This led Johnson to personally award the Medal of Honor as an alternative. Thus, Walker was not formally recommended for the [[Medal of Honor]], and this unusual process may also explain why authorities overlooked her ineligibility, ironically on the grounds of lacking a commission.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Harris, Dr. Mary Walker: An American Radical (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2009), 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] created a pension act for Medal of Honor recipients, and in doing so created separate Army and Navy Medal of Honor Rolls. The Army was directed to review eligibility of prior recipients in a separate bill not related to the pension rolls, but which had been requested by the Army in order to retroactively police undesirable awards. The undesirable awards resulted from the lack of regulations on the medal; the Army had published no regulations until 1897, and the law had very few requirements, meaning that recipients could earn a medal for virtually any reason, resulting in nearly 900 awards for enlistment extensions not in combat. The Army's Medal of Honor Board deliberated from 1916 to 1917, and struck 911 names from the Army Medal of Honor Roll, including those of Dr. Mary Edwards Walker and [[Buffalo Bill|William F. "Buffalo Bill" Cody]]. The latter were considered ineligible for the Army Medal of Honor because the 1862, 1863, and 1904 laws strictly required recipients to be officers or enlisted members. In Walker's case, she was a civilian contract surgeon, and was not a commissioned officer. Nevertheless, the Medal of Honor Board most certainly discriminated against Walker because it declined to revoke the Medal of at least two other contract surgeons who were equally ineligible. One of these was Major General Leonard Wood, a former Chief of Staff of the Army who was a civilian contract surgeon in the same status as Walker when he was recommended for the award. This was known to the Medal of Honor Board, as board president General Nelson Miles had twice recommended Wood's medal and knew that he was ineligible. The disenrolled recipients were not ordered to return their medals per a recommendation from the Army Judge Advocate General, who noted that Congress did not grant the Army the jurisdiction to enforce this provision of the statute, rendering both the repossession and criminal penalties inoperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dwight|last= Mears |title=The Medal of Honor: The Evolution of America's Highest Military Decoration |place=Lawrence, KS|publisher= University Press of Kansas||isbn=9780700626656|oclc=	1032014828|pages= 57-59, 169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several sources attribute President [[Jimmy Carter]] with restoring Walker's medal posthumously in 1977, this is probably incorrect, since the action was taken well below the Secretary of the Army, at the level of the Army's Assistant Secretary for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, which was acting on a recommendation from the Board for Correction of Military Records. In fact, both the Ford and Carter Administrations opposed the restoration; the Carter White House reacted with confusion to the announcement of the Board's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dwight|last= Mears|title= The Medal of Honor: The Evolution of America's Highest Military Decoration|place=Lawrence, KS|publisher= University Press of Kansas|date=2018||isbn=9780700626656|oclc=	1032014828|page= 172}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent historical work documented that the Board for Correction probably exceeded its authority in making a unilateral restoration of the medal, since the Board is merely a delegation of the authority of the Secretary of the Army, and thus cannot contradict a standing law much less a law that expressly required the revocation of Walker's medal. Therefore, the decision was controversial because it raised separation of powers issues; the Board's mandate was only to correct errors or injustices within its authority, not act against the authority of public law. This very point was illustrated by the awarding of Garlin Conner's Medal of Honor in early 2018, which also originated from the Board for Correction, but instead went through the President and required a statutory waiver from Congress-- seen to be a requirement because the Board lacked the authority to contravene a public law and the associated statutes of limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dwight|last= Mears|title= The Medal of Honor: The Evolution of America's Highest Military Decoration|place= Lawrence, KS|publisher= University Press of Kansas)|date=2018|pages= 171, 192|isbn=9780700626656|oclc=	1032014828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker felt that she had been awarded the Medal of Honor because she had gone into enemy territory to care for the suffering inhabitants, when no man had the courage to do so, for fear of being imprisoned.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Mohamed Ghannouchi''' ({{lang-ar|محمد الغنوشي}} ''Muhammad Al-Ghannushi''; born 18 August 1941) is a Tunisian politician who was [[Prime Minister of Tunisia]] from 1999 to 2011. Regarded as a [[technocrat]], Ghannouchi was a long-standing figure in the Tunisian government under President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]].

After Ben Ali's ousting in the 2011 [[Tunisian Revolution]], he remained Prime Minister for six weeks before stepping down.

==Political career==
Ghannouchi was a member of the Tunisian parliament for the [[Democratic Constitutional Rally]]. He was Minister of Finance from 1989 to 1992.  From 1992 to 1999, he served as Minister of International Co-operation and Foreign Investment, and from 1999 to 2011 he was the Prime Minister of Tunisia,&lt;ref name="allbusiness_minister"&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/government/778529-1.html TUNISIA - Mohamed Ghannouchi], AllBusiness, 9 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt; making him the longest serving prime minister since the proclamation of independence, surpassing his predecessor [[Hamed Karoui]].&lt;ref name="allbusiness_minister"/&gt;

After the fall of President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] on 14 January 2011 in the wake of the [[2010–2011 Tunisian uprising]], he was the self-proclaimed acting President of the country for a few hours starting on 14 January 2011,&lt;ref name="BBC 12195025"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12195025|title=Tunisia: President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali forced out|publisher=BBC News|date=14 January 2011|accessdate=15 January 2011|archivedate=15 January 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115053136/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12195025|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Angelique Chrisafis"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chrisafis|first=Angelique|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/14/tunisian-president-flees-country-protests|title=Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali flees Tunisia as interim president takes control|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 January 2011|accessdate=15 January 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115053940/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/14/tunisian-president-flees-country-protests|archivedate=15 January 2011|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; under Article 56 of the [[Constitution of Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="Ben Ali quits"&gt;{{cite news|date=14 January 2011|accessdate=15 January 2011|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/01/14/133432.html|title=Ben Ali quits after 23 yrs in power &amp; leaves Tunisia|agency=[[Al Arabiya]]|archivedate=15 January 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115012355/http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/01/14/133432.html|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM replaces"&gt;{{cite news|date=14 January 2011|accessdate=15 January 2011|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/2011114172228117723.html|title=PM replaces Tunisia president|agency=[[Al Jazeera]]|archivedate=14 January 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114221522/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/2011114172228117723.html|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained Prime Minister for six weeks before stepping down.

===WikiLeaks description===
In a 2006 diplomatic cable from the United States that was leaked by [[WikiLeaks]] during the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]], Ghannouchi was described as being generally popular among the population of Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Black|first=Ian|title=Tunisia: The WikiLeaks connection|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/15/tunisia-wikileaks-ghannouchi|accessdate=15 January 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghannouchi was seen as a respected technocrat by US diplomats in early 2010, with a cable stating, "Prime Minister Ghannouchi, the respected, {{sic|dil|ligent}}, pragmatic, and apolitical technocrat, has served in his post since 1999 and with his reappointment appears set to surpass longevity records for senior officials since Tunisia's independence in 1956. Tunis oddsmakers had expected Ghannouchi, reportedly tired after a decade on the job, to move on, but it appears Ben Ali has come to view him as indispensable."&lt;ref name="10TUNIS34"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=Gordon|title=Ben Ali's January 14 cabinet shuffle is a nod to the U.S., but not a strategic reversal|id={{WikiLeaks cable|10TUNIS34}}|publisher=WikiLeaks/Al Akhbar|date=15 January 2010|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/soc/wl/al-akhbar/10TUNIS34.html|accessdate=15 January 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vkEFzytw?url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/soc/wl/al-akhbar/10TUNIS34.html|archivedate=15 January 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passport, a blog by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', gave a different view of Ghannouchi, saying he "is not necessarily any more popular than Ben Ali, though he's not nearly as tainted by the lurid tales of corruption and excess that so damaged the ruling family. But Tunisians certainly don't respect the prime minister; they call him 'Mr. Oui Oui' because he's always saying yes to Ben Ali".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hounshell|first=Blake|title=Mr. Oui Oui takes charge|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/01/14/mr_oui_oui_takes_charge|work=Foreign Policy|accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role following 2010–2011 Tunisian uprising===
On 14 January 2011, before Ben Ali had fled the country during the [[Tunisian Revolution]], Ghannouchi announced that Ben Ali had called for parliamentary elections in six months, dismissed the government, and asked him to form a new government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ben Ali dismissed the government|url=http://www.ennaharonline.com/en/international/5540.html|accessdate=15 January 2011|newspaper=# Ennaharonline|date=14 January 2011|archivedate=26 July 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726023622/http://www.ennaharonline.com/en/international/5540.html|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the evening, Ghannouchi announced that he was taking temporary control of the country on state television.&lt;ref name="newyork"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David|title=Prime Minister Claims Power in Tunisia as President Flees|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/world/africa/15tunis.html?_r=3&amp;src=me|accessdate=15 January 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=14 January 2011|archivedate=24 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224211745/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/world/africa/15tunis.html?_r=3&amp;src=me|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghannouchi promised to begin discussing political and economic reforms the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tunisia protests force president from power|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-0115-tunisia-protests-20110115,0,4294274.story|accessdate=15 January 2011|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=15 January 2011|author=Borzou Daragahi|author2=Sihem Hassaini}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghannouchi said he would hold new elections within sixty days, as required by the Tunisian Constitution.&lt;ref name="econ"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mohamed Ghannouchi|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2011/01/tunisias_troubles|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=15 January 2011|date=15 January 2011|archivedate=16 January 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116201854/https://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2011/01/tunisias_troubles|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 15, ''The Economist'' reported that some protesters were calling for Ghannouchi to step down.&lt;ref name="econ"/&gt; On that same day, it was announced that [[Parliament of Tunisia|Congress]] [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] [[Fouad Mebazaa]] was taking the post of Acting President of Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/ansalatina/notizie/fdg/201101151257393872/201101151257393872.html 57 MUERTOS EN INCENDIO EN PRISION DE MONASTIR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al Jazeera]] claimed that some lawyers disagreed with Ghannouchi's claim to power, interpreting the [[Constitution of Tunisia|constitution]] differently, in particular referring to Article 57.&lt;ref name="aljazeera_constitution_deb"&gt;{{cite news|title=Constitutional debate after Ben Ali|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/2011114204942484776.html|date=14 January 2011|agency=Al Jazeera|accessdate=15 January 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vk6hpRok?url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/2011114204942484776.html|archivedate=15 January 2011|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards he resumed as Prime Minister and formed a new national unity government that included members of opposition parties, civil society representatives, and even a blogger, [[Slim Amamou]], who only a week previous had been imprisoned by the regime of the deposed President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2011/01/new_government_tunisia|title=Out with the old?|date=19 January 2011|work=The Economist|accessdate=19 January 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120042523/https://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2011/01/new_government_tunisia|archivedate=20 January 2011|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghannouchi resigned his membership of the RCD on 18 January. His resignation was followed by similar action by the other RCD members within the government; but on 27 January, Ghannouchi carried out a major reshuffle of the government to remove all former RCD members other than himself.

After a new wave of protests, Ghannouchi resigned as PM on 27 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12591445 Tunisian interim PM Ghannouchi resigns over protests], ''[[BBC News]]'', 27 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/02/27/uk-tunisia-idUKTRE71Q1H820110227 Tunisia prime minister resigns after protests], ''[[Reuters]]'', 27 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''murder of Muriel Drinkwater''' is an unsolved 1946 child murder case from [[Wales]]. Drinkwater, a 12-year-old schoolgirl, was raped and shot in  the woods in [[Penllergaer]], [[Swansea]]. The case became known as the '''Little Red Riding Hood murder'''. In 2008, a DNA profile of the suspect was extracted from her clothes, possibly the oldest one in the world to be successfully extracted in a murder investigation.&lt;ref name="bbc2008"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gabriel|first1=Clare|title=Mystery of 1946 murder in woods|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/7711196.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=17 September 2016|date=5 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder and investigation==
Muriel Joan Drinkwater was the youngest of four daughters born to John Percival and Margaret (''née'' Morgans) Drinkwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Robin|title=Hunt on for 80-year-old Swansea killer|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/hunt-80-year-old-swansea-killer-2138485|website=Wales Online|accessdate=17 September 2016|date=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 June 1946, she took the school bus home from Penllergaer Grammar School. She was last seen at 2:30 p.m., singing as she headed for the one-mile walk to her family's home, Tyle-Du Farm. The path she walked home on curved in and out of the woods; her mother saw her walking home along the path and go into the woods, but not come out again. The last person who reported seeing her was Hubert Hoyles, then 13, who passed her on the path returning from her family farm, where he had gone to buy eggs.&lt;ref name="dm20082"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Barbara|title=Real waking the dead: This schoolgirl's savage murder has mystified police for 62 years.

The next day, Drinkwater's body was found in the woods by a police inspector. She had been raped, shot twice in the chest, and beaten in the head. Two days later, police found one of the murder weapons, a World War I-era [[M1911|Colt .45]].&lt;ref name="wales"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Robin|title=Secrecy over 1940 murder as DNA offers new leads|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/secrecy-over-1940-murder-dna-1932226|website=Wales Online|accessdate=17 September 2016|date=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2008"/&gt; Glamorgan police, assisted by the 169th Bomb Disposal Unit, used a metal detector to search for a second weapon suspected to have been used, but never located it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McConnell |first1=Ed |title=The unsolved murder of a 12-year-old brutally abused and killed |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/unsolved-murder-12-year-old-15290561 |accessdate=20 October 2018 |work=Wales Online |date=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detectives from [[Scotland Yard]] came to Swansea to assist in the investigation of the murder, among a rash of slayings of women during the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serial Slaying of Pretty Women Has New Scotland Yard Confused|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19460729&amp;id=Si4rAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NZkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3598,4267424|website=The Montreal Gazette|accessdate=17 September 2016|agency=Associated Press|date=29 July 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police visited every house within 150 square miles, and interviewed 20,000 men in Swansea and neighbouring [[Aberdare]] and [[Carmarthenshire]].&lt;ref name="wales"/&gt;

More than 3,000 mourners attended Drinkwater's funeral on 2 July. She was buried at St David's Church in Penllergaer.&lt;ref name="wales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2008"/&gt;

A description of a person of interest was circulated; he was described as approximately 30 years old, with "thick fluffy hair and wearing brown corduroy trousers and a light brown sports jacket."&lt;ref name="bbc2008"/&gt;

Police also circulated photos of the American army issue gun; notably, perspex had been used to modernise the original wooden stocks next to the grip. It was believed a similar weapon had been used in the murder of a cinema manager in [[Bristol]]. In August, the police appealed to the United States public for assistance, as many Americans had been stationed in Penllergaer during the recent war and there was a possibility one of the servicemen had sold the weapon.&lt;ref name="bbc2008"/&gt;

==DNA discovery==
In 2003, detectives re-opened the case in the hope of finding DNA evidence on the gun, but were not successful as too many people had handled the gun. It was believed her clothes had been lost.&lt;ref name="dm2008"/&gt;

In 2008, a team of retired detectives investigating cold cases found Drinkwater's clothes in storage. Her blue coat, underwear and school uniform had been wrapped in a paper bag and stored. On the back of the coat, a no-longer visible semen stain was circled with yellow crayon.&lt;ref name="wales"/&gt; Scientists successfully retrieved a DNA profile from the stain on the coat. A familial DNA profile was extracted using a technique called [[Y-STR]], but no match was found in the national DNA database.&lt;ref name="bbcdna"&gt;{{cite web|title=DNA breakthrough on 1946 murder|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/7708974.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=17 September 2016|date=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubert Hoyles, who saw her after buying eggs at her parent's farm, was cleared by the DNA evidence. He stated he had long been suspected by some locals as the murderer and was happy to clear his name.&lt;ref name="dm20082"/&gt;

==Sheila Martin==

In 2009, Welsh police began reinvestigating any link with the murder of 11-year-old Sheila Martin, who was raped and strangled 250 miles away in Sun Hill Wood, [[Fawkham Green]], [[Kent]], on 7 July 1946, 10 days after Drinkwater's murder. Both girls were murdered in woods within a half mile of their homes. South Wales Police detectives requested the original case file from Kent Police to determine if there was a connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Neill |first1=Sean |title=Detectives link Muriel Drinkwater and Sheila Martin murders |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/detectives-link-muriel-drinkwater-and-sheila-martin-murders-vw3fx2ltcsp |accessdate=3 July 2018 |work=The Times |date=23 March 2009 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kent"&gt;{{cite news |last1=McConnell |first1=Ed |title='I know who killed girl in woods in 1946' |url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/dartford/news/i-know-who-killed-girl-158735/ |accessdate=3 July 2018 |work=Kent Online |date=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welsh [[true crime]] author Neil Milkins has theorised that notorious child murderer [[Harold Jones (murderer)|Harold Jones]] (1906–1971) was responsible for both murders.&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt;

==Public access==
In 2010, the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Council on [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Records and Archives]] closed off public access to the case. The public can no longer access the Drinkwater files by Freedom of Information Act requests or in person at the archives office in [[Kew]]. The reason given for sealing the files was that it could help the police catch the perpetrator.&lt;ref name="wales"/&gt;

'''National Missing Children's Day''' has been commemorated in the United States on May 25, since 1983, when it was first proclaimed by President [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=1305|title=National Missing Children's Day - May 25|work=National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children|accessdate=April 23, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423190718/http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=1305|archivedate=April 23, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It falls on the same day as the [[International Missing Children's Day]], which was established in 2001.

In the several years preceding the establishment of National Missing Children's day, a series of high-profile missing-children cases made national headlines.

On May 25, 1979, [[Etan Patz]] was only six years old when he disappeared from his [[New York City]] home on his way from bus to school. The date of his disappearance was designated as National Missing Children's Day. At the time, cases of missing children rarely garnered national media attention, but his case quickly received extensive coverage. His father, a professional photographer, distributed black-and-white photographs of him in an effort to find him. The resulting massive search and media attention that followed focused the public's attention on the problem of child abduction and the lack of plans to address it.

For almost three years, media attention was focused on [[Atlanta, Georgia]], where the bodies of young children were discovered in lakes, marshes, and ponds along roadside trails. Twenty-nine bodies were recovered in the [[Atlanta murders of 1979–1981]] before a suspect was arrested and convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Victims linked to Atlanta serial killings |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/05/31/atlanta.murders.victims/ |publisher=CNN |accessdate=May 25, 2016 |date=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2132">'''Philippe de Maldeghem''' (died 1611) was a Renaissance courtier, mayor of the [[Brugse Vrije]] and a translator of [[Petrarch]].

==Life==
Philippe's father was Josse van Maldeghem, lord of Leyschot and Oetsel, chamberlain to the duke of Bavaria, and mayor of the [[Brugse Vrije]]; his mother was Anne de Joigny de Pamele.&lt;ref name=BWN&gt;[[A. J. van der Aa]], ''Biographisch Wordenboek der Nederlanden'', continued by K.J.R van Harderwijk and G.D.J. Schotel, vol. 12, part 1 (Haarlem, 1869), 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippe himself was steward and chamberlain to [[Ernest of Bavaria]], [[Archbishop-Elector of Cologne]] and [[Prince-Bishop of Liège]], and followed in his father's footsteps as mayor of the Brugse Vrije (1578–1608).&lt;ref name=BWN/&gt;

In 1600 he published a French translation of Petrarch in Brussels, dedicated to [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian of Bavaria]].&lt;ref name=BWN/&gt;

He was knighted on 21 May 1605.

In 1567 he married Martine de Boonem (died 1607), who brought the lordship of Avelgem to the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;M. de Vegiano, ''Nobiliaire des Pays-Bas et du comté de Bourgogne'', revised by J.S.F.J.L. de Herckenrode, vol. 3 (Ghent, 1868), pp. 1285-1286.&lt;/ref&gt; Together they had a number of children:
# Adolf, lord of Leyschot, Oetsel and Avelgem (knighted 30 March 1617), who several times served as mayor of [[Bruges]]
# Josse, governor of Damme and of Landrecies
# Robert, lord of Grimârès, who served in the [[Army of Flanders]], rising to the rank of Lieutenant-General (knighted 15 August 1610)

'''''Primary Colors: A Novel of Politics''''' is a ''[[roman à clef]]'', a work of fiction that actually describes real life characters and events – namely, [[Bill Clinton]]'s first [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|presidential campaign]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992]]. It has been compared to two other novels about American politics: [[Robert Penn Warren]]'s ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1946)&lt;ref name="author author"/&gt; and ''[[O: A Presidential Novel]]'' (2011).&lt;ref name="who wrote"/&gt;

The book was originally published by an anonymous author, who was later found to be columnist [[Joe Klein (journalist)|Joe Klein]]. Klein completed a sequel of sorts, ''The Running Mate'' in 2000, focusing on the ''Primary Colors'' character of Charlie Martin.&lt;ref name="crossfire"/&gt;

==Unmasking of "Anonymous"==
An early reviewer opined that the author wished to remain unknown because "Anonymity makes truthfulness much easier".&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; Later commentators called the publishing of the book under an anonymous identity an effective marketing strategy that produced more publicity for the book, and thus more sales, without calling into question the author's actual inside knowledge.&lt;ref name="who wrote"/&gt;

Several people, including former Clinton speechwriter David Kusnet, believed the style of writing had similarities to that of Klein. This was also supported by a quantitative [[stylometry|stylometric]] analysis of the book by [[Vassar College|Vassar]] professor [[Donald Foster (professor)|Donald Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2000/11/02/foster_5/ ''Author Unknown'' by Gavin McNett Salon November 2, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Klein initially denied writing the book and publicly condemned Foster.&lt;ref name="enlightens readers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="great unknown"/&gt; Klein denied authorship again in ''[[Newsweek]]'', speculating that another writer wrote it. ''[[Washington Post]]'' Style editor David von Drehle, in an interview, asked Klein if he was willing to stake his journalistic credibility on his denial, to which Klein agreed.&lt;ref name="media's true"/&gt;

On July 17, 1996, after ''The Washington Post'' published the results of a handwriting analysis of notes made on an early manuscript of the book, Klein finally admitted that he was "Anonymous".&lt;ref name="mea culpa"/&gt;

==Plot summary==
The book begins as an idealistic former congressional worker, Henry Burton, joins the presidential campaign of Southern governor Jack Stanton, a thinly disguised stand-in for [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; The plot then follows the primary election calendar beginning in New Hampshire where Stanton's affair with Cashmere, his wife's hairdresser, and his participation in a Vietnam War era protest come to light and threaten to derail his presidential prospects.&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; In Florida, Stanton revives his campaign by disingenuously portraying his Democratic opponent as insufficiently pro-Israel and as a weak supporter of Social Security.&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; Burton becomes increasingly disillusioned with Stanton, who is a policy wonk who talks too long, eats too much and is overly flirtatious toward women.&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; Stanton is also revealed to be insincere in his beliefs, saying whatever will help him to win.&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt; Matters finally come to a head, and Burton is forced to choose between idealism and realism.

==Reviews==
''The New York Daily News'' described the book as a farce and praised it as funny, truthful, and as containing "uncannily accurate" portraits of its thinly disguised characters.&lt;ref name="politics makes"/&gt;

'''Qol Ghali''' ({{lang-tt|Кол Гали}}, {{lang-ba|Ҡол Fәли}}, {{lang-cv|Кул Али}}, {{lang-ru|Кул Гали}}, ''Kul Gali''; circa 1183-1236) was a famous [[Muslim]] [[Volga Bulgar]] poet, the founder of medieval Tatar literature. His most famous poem is  ''Qíssai Yosıf'' (''Tale of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Yusuf]]''), written in the [[Old Tatar language|Turki literary language]], which is not mutually intelligible with the modern Tatar, Bashkir and Chuvash languages.

It is believed that he was born in what is today Eastern [[Tatarstan]]. He studied in the [[Khwarezm]]ean [[madrassah]]. He wrote his immortal poem in 1233. He was probably killed in 1236 during the [[Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Language icon|cv}} [http://www.chuvash.org/e/d09ad183d0bb20d090d0bbd0b8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
His poems are celebrated by the [[Tatars]], the [[Bashkirs]] and the [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]].

''Qíssai Yosıf'' was inspired by [[Qur'an]]ic stories of [[Joseph in Islam|Joseph]]. The poem is devoted to the struggle against evil and for human happiness. The poem played a major role in the Muslim Volga Bulgar culture and later the Tatar culture. More than 200 manuscripts have been found among the [[Volga Tatars|Tatars]]. The poem was prepared for publishing for the first time by the poet [[Utız İmäni]] and printed in 1839 by [[Räxmätulla Ämirxanov]]. Since then it has been republished 80 times.&lt;ref name="TES"&gt;{{TES|Кол Гали}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qol Ghali award==
The ''Qol Ghali International Award'' is named after Qol Ghali. It is awarded to recognize excellence in literature and poetry. The award was established in 1992.&lt;ref name="TES"/&gt;

'''Alexander "Sasha" Siemel''' ({{lang-lv|Aleksandrs Ziemelis}}; 1890-1970) was an [[United States|American]]/[[Argentina|Argentinian]]  adventurer, hunter, guide, actor, writer, [[photographer]], and lecturer of [[Latvians|Latvian]] origin. He spoke seven languages and boasted of having experienced more adventure in a single year than most men had witnessed in a lifetime. He is known among sportsmen, claiming to have successfully hunted more than 300 [[jaguar]]s — or "onças", as the big cats are colloquially known in parts of Latin America—in the [[Mato Grosso]] jungles of Brazil. Siemel's accomplishments in pursuing the large and often dangerous jaguar (the biggest cat in the western hemisphere and third largest in the world) are all the more impressive because on many of his hunts he was allegedly armed only with a spear.

== Biography ==

Born in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]], Siemel moved to the United States in 1907 at the age of 17. Staying in the states for only two years, he subsequently headed for Argentina where he was employed in a Buenos Aires printing shop. In 1914 Siemel traveled to the jungles of Brazil where he worked as a gunsmith and mechanic in the diamond mining camps of the Mato Grosso. There he met a native who taught him to become a "Tigrero;" that is, a hunter who kills jaguars armed only with a spear.  In the article "Interviewing the Tiger-Man", Siemel states: "… I learned the art from a poor native who had nothing but a home-made spear where I had my high-powered rifle. But I do think I was a good pupil and will admit that it calls for experience and judgment."&lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;  In the July 1937 issue of ''Ye Slyvan Archer'', he wrote that: "It is only logical and natural that I should (prefer the bow to the rifle). The spear is a primitive weapon, so is the bow.  While I would not want to say that hunting big cats with a rifle can not be plenty dangerous and exciting under all circumstances, particularly so in our Matto Grosso jungles, where vision is extremely limited, it seems to me that the bow complements the spear.  If I now had any use for a shield besides, I should feel perfectly equipped."&lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt;

With his skill as a hunter Siemel worked on ranches of the Pantanal hunting jaguars, or "onças," hired by landowners to protect their livestock. In 1925, he killed his first jaguar using a ''zagya,'' a seven-foot spear, making him the first white man to accomplish such a feat. This did not long go unnoticed by the "civilized world." By 1931 a monograph, ''Green Hell,'' by Julian Duguid, appeared. The book recounts a 1929 trip across the Pantanal where the author and two fellow adventurers employ Siemel as their guide. Here Siemel is first given the moniker "Tiger Man," which went on to become the title of Duguid's 1932 biography of the hunter. Encouraged by Duguid, Siemel began to lecture at explorer clubs throughout the world.
&lt;!--[[Image:junglemenace2.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Original poster for ''[[Jungle Menace]]'' (1937)]]--&gt;
In 1937, while lecturing in Philadelphia, Siemel met Edith Bray, a young photographer, who later joined him in the Pantanal. Three years later, at the age of 47, he married Edith, and the two remained in the Pantanal and began raising a family. During this time, Siemel became an actor, appearing in the 1937 fifteen-episode [[Frank Buck (animal collector)|Frank Buck]] serial ''[[Jungle Menace]]'' as Tiger Van Dorn. The serial was compiled into a feature film in 1946 and released under the title ''Jungle Terror''.

Sasha, Edith and their children, Sondra, Dora, and Sasha Jr. (Sashino), moved to southeastern Pennsylvania after purchasing a farm in 1947. Bom Retiro, as they named the farm, became Siemel's permanent residence for the rest of his life. Here the Siemels' second son, Carlie, was born in 1955, completing the family. Siemel led a quiet life, lecturing and continuing to lead expeditions to South America. He now spoke six languages: Latvian (learned in the streets in Riga), Russian (in the schools he attended as a youngster in Latvia), German (at home, his mother was German), English (in the USA), Spanish (in Argentina), and Portuguese (in Brazil).

As an author, Siemel had been writing articles for various outdoor magazines, including ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''. In 1949, Sasha and Edith co-wrote the book ''Jungle Wife'', an account of family life in the jungle. He penned his autobiography,''Tigrero'', in 1953. It was to be made into a movie by director Samuel Fuller. Instead, Tigrero is the subject of  a 1994 documentary by Mika Kaurismäki. ''Tigrero: A Film That Was Never Made'' featured Fuller and Jim Jarmusch visiting the proposed Amazon locations of the film. In 1954, Siemel's book ''Jungle Fury'' was published. (''Jungle Fury'' is the same book as ''Tigrero'' but retitled for the UK.)

Siemel was interviewed by journalist Charles Collingwood for the ''[[Adventure (TV series)|Adventure]]'' series produced by the [[American Museum of Natural History]] and broadcast on the CBS television network in 1953.  The family returned to Brazil briefly in 1959, when Sashino was thirteen years old. His adventure is told in the 1965 book ''Sashino''.
 
In 1963,The Sasha Siemel Museum and Store opened in Perkiomenville, Pennsylvania, in a century-old former story mill located on the Perkiomen Creek. The museum housed Siemel's collection of hunting trophies, works of art, curios, minerals, shells, coins, weapons, Indian utensils and many other items. "Among the most interesting of the displays are Sasha Siemel's mementos of his many years of daring adventures and explorations as the only white man to hunt jaguars armed with a hand-made spear. Here are the trophies of many exciting hunts and the equipment used in hunting and capturing jaguars."&lt;ref&gt;3&lt;/ref&gt; Museum admission was 75 cents for adults and 25 cents for children. The museum closed in 1969 after Siemel's last trip to the Pantanal, in which he guided a group of geologists. Sasha Siemel died in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, in 1970 at the age of 80 .

SEGMENT 1: Spear Hunting Jaguars. Charles Collingwood, narrator of the Adventure series, interviews Sasha Siemel, a professional hunter for 35 years who makes his living spear hunting jaguars for cattle ranchers in South America. Siemel, who has lectured at the AMNH, shows films of various forms of wildlife around his home in Matto Grosso, Brazil, and also lets the viewers see his hunting activities: capturing a cub in the jungle and spearing a jaguar. (Jaguars are the largest cats in the New World.) Siemel has killed over 300 jaguars, but only 31 by spear. Siemel demonstrates in the studio the movements of a spear hunter and shows some of his own hand-made spears to the studio while discussing their construction techniques.

'''Tahrohon Wayne Shannon''' (born February 24, 1978) is an American politician from [[Oklahoma]]. Shannon was elected to the [[Oklahoma House of Representatives]] from his hometown of Lawton in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ok.gov/elections Oklahoma State Election Board] (accessed March 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In a ceremony on January 8, 2013, Shannon took the oath of office to be Oklahoma’s first African-American [[List of Speakers of the Oklahoma House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]].&lt;ref&gt;McNutt, Michael.

Shannon of Lawton officially takes Oklahoma House speakers post]," ''The Oklahoman'', January 9, 2013 (accessed March 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Shannon stepped down as the Speaker of the House to run for the Republican nomination in the [[United States Senate special election in Oklahoma, 2014|special Senate election]] to succeed [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Tom Coburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/29/tw-shannon-senate_n_4687252.html|title=T.W.

Despite Tea Party support and endorsements that included U.S. Senator [[Ted Cruz]] and former Governor [[Sarah Palin]], Shannon lost the Republican nomination for the Senate to [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[James Lankford]] by almost 20 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/oklahoma-primary-2014-james-lankford-108269.html?hp=f2|title=James Lankford wins Oklahoma GOP Senate nomination outright|date=June 24, 2014|accessdate=June 25, 2014|first=Tarini|last=Parti|work=[[POLITICO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/james-lankford-defeats-tw-shannon-oklahoma-senate-primary "James Lankford defeats T.W.

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Oklahoma]] on February 24, 1978, Shannon earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|Bachelor of Arts degree]] in communications from [[Cameron University]] and holds a [[Juris Doctor]] from Oklahoma City University Law School. He worked as a field representative for former Congressman [[J. C. Watts]] a decade ago{{when|date=February 2014}} and served in the same position for Congressman [[Tom Cole]] the following two years. An enrolled member of the [[Chickasaw Nation]], he worked as the chief administrative officer for Chickasaw Nation Enterprises.

Shannon attends Bethlehem Baptist Church in Lawton. He met his wife, Devon (Murray), at [[Cameron University]] and married her in 2001.&lt;ref name="speakerfeature"&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/article.aspx/Oklahoma_House_Speaker_TW_Shannon_making_name_for_himself/20130428_16_A1_CUTLIN414577 Oklahoma House Speaker T.W. Shannon making name for himself], ''Tulsa World'', April 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They have two children, a daughter and son. Today, he operates a home-based public relations business.&lt;ref name="speakerfeature"/&gt;

==Political career==
[[File:7G2U5163.jpg|thumb|left|Shannon is sworn in as Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives.]]

Shannon was first elected to the [[Oklahoma House of Representatives]] in 2006, beating opponent Janice Drewry in the general election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ok.gov/elections/documents/06sh.pdf 2006 General Election], Oklahoma State Election Board (accessed May 27, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; He rose to leadership in the state House, where he served as deputy majority whip in his first term, chaired the transportation committee in his second term and was elected speaker-designate in his third term. On January 8, 2013, Shannon took the oath of office to be the [[Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives]].

He has advocated for identifying and selling off state-owned properties that were not being fully utilized.&lt;ref&gt;McNutt, Michael. [http://newsok.com/oklahoma-should-sell-some-buildings-to-fund-capitol-repairs-lawmaker-says/article/3623053 Oklahoma should sell some buildings to fund capitol repairs, lawmaker says]''The Oklahoman'' November 14, 2011. (accessed March 23, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Shannon sponsored an eight-year plan to divert state income tax revenue to repairing Oklahoma’s structurally deficient bridges.&lt;ref&gt;Hoberock, Barbara. [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=336&amp;articleid=20120605_16_A1_CUTLIN537471 Oklahoma funding to increase bridge repairs], ''Tulsa World'', June 12, 2012. (accessed March 23, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

As Speaker, Shannon authored legislation to create a long-term plan to address the maintenance of state-owned properties and consolidate property management entities.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://newsok.com/effort-to-sell-oklahomas-unused-buildings-properties-continues/article/3764283 Effort to sell Oklahoma's unused buildings, properties]", ''The Oklahoman'' March 10, 2013 (accessed March 23, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first sale under the program to sell off state-owned properties was the sale of a former studio for the state public television station for $130,000. The next properties up for sale are a townlot in Buffalo and 5.58 acres in Marietta.&lt;ref name="oeta"&gt;Krehbiel, Randy. "[http://www.tulsaworld.com/article.aspx/Former_Oklahoma_Educational_Television_Authority_studio/20130704_11_A10_Thesta696335 Ex-OETA studio sold through new state program]", ''Tulsa World'', July 4, 2013. (accessed July 11, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon advocated a controversial measure to require Oklahoma recipients of the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (food stamps) to perform at least 35 hours of work activities or be denied aid. The work requirement was scaled back after the cost of providing job training to SNAP recipients became clear.&lt;ref&gt;McNutt, Michael and Kemp, Adam. "[http://newsok.com/oklahoma-house-speaker-scales-back-food-stamp-work-requirement/article/3763518/ Oklahoma House speaker scales back food stamp work requirement]", ''The Oklahoman'', March 8, 2011. (accessed June 27, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GOPAC]], an organization whose mission it is to support up-and-coming Republican leaders, added Shannon to its national advisory board in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conservative.org/cpac/ CPAC] (accessed March 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

House District 62 encompasses [[Lawton, Oklahoma]] and its surrounding communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okhouse.gov/Research/HouseDistricts.aspx House Districts, Congressional and Other Maps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507095639/http://www.okhouse.gov/Research/HouseDistricts.aspx |date=2009-05-07 }}, [http://www.okhouse.gov Oklahoma House of Representatives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622043630/http://okhouse.gov/ |date=2013-06-22 }}.

'''Terje Larsen''' (22 August 1958 – 10 May 2018), known as "'''The Wanderer'''" ({{lang-no|Vandreren}}), was a Norwegian convicted serial [[burglar]]. Convicted of 664 burglaries, but suspected of carrying out several thousand, he has been described as a legend in Norwegian criminal history. Since the beginning of the 1980s, Larsen wandered throughout the country, burglarizing hundreds of [[Cottage|cabins]] and [[Ski lodge|lodges]], often spending several nights in the process, all the while avoiding law enforcement. He was named one of Norway's most notorious criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Redaksjonen|title=De notoriske: Norges topp 10 kriminelle|url=http://www.nattogdag.no/artikler/4456/de-notoriske-norges-topp-10-kriminelle#.UfGNsUBwtng|accessdate=25 July 2013|newspaper=Natt og Dag|date=22 November 2010|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Larsen was born on 22 August 1958, in a Gypsy family in [[Sandviken]], a neighborhood in [[Bergen]], and has four siblings. Old acquaintances describes the family as being very interested in recreational activities, spending a lot of time outdoors. The children learned early to survive in the mountains. They could hunt, fish, and make "anything with their hands." And they learned to hike and trek through the forests.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite web|last=Østli|first=Kjetil|title=Vandreren er i området!|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/amagasinet/Vandreren-er-i-omradet-6454411.html#.UfGO0UBwtng|publisher=Aftenposten.no|accessdate=25 July 2013|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to outdoor activities, Larsen had a great passion for [[Association football|football]], and was once expected to become a professional footballer. He played as a winger with IL Sandviken. After school, he went to [[Copenhagen]] and joined the Danish club [[Fremad Amager]], but soon dropped out and started living on the streets.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

==Criminal life==
After returning to Bergen from Copenhagen in the late 1970s, he found himself homeless and jobless. He soon started breaking into multiple cabins, receiving his first criminal conviction in 1979. He continued burglarizing however, first in the vicinity around Bergen, before moving to [[Voss]] and [[Hardanger]]. Here he would raid the area and gather large depots of stolen goods. On 20 July 1989, he left Bergen with his cousin and friend Svend Dahle, and moved to eastern Norway. One year later, on 3 August 1990, the two were raiding a cottage in [[Tolga, Norway|Tolga]] in [[Østerdalen]] when, both drunk after having raided the cottage's alcohol store, they started fighting. Larsen left the cottage, and when he came back he found the cottage burned down and Dahle dead inside it. Larsen was charged and convicted of involuntary manslaughter, but was later released on parole.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

After receiving thirteen convictions throughout the 1990s for over 450 burglaries, he was arrested again in October 2000 and charged with 221 new counts of burglary, and was subsequently sentenced to three years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Austejord|first=Kai|title=Vandreren får tre års fengsel|url=http://www.tv2.no/nyheter/innenriks/vandreren-faar-tre-aars-fengsel-31136.html|accessdate=25 July 2013|newspaper=tv2.no|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, in late April 2001, he escaped from prison while on temporary [[parole]]. After slipping away into the forest, he immediately embarked upon a massive burglary-spree. During the next four months, Larsen robbed 60 cabins in [[Ringsaker]], over 50 cabins in [[Stor-Elvdal]], 25 cabins in [[Alvdal]] and [[Folldal]], as well as over 30 cabins on around [[Dovre|Mount Dovre]]. By mid-August, the search for Larsen had turned into a large manhunt, involving the police, hunters, cabin owners and local volunteers, all scouring the forests and wilderness and conducting 24-hour patrols of popular hiking areas, searching for any trace of the notorious criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Redaksjonen|title=Vandreren mistenkes for 150 hytteinnbrudd|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=3648622|accessdate=26 July 2013|newspaper=Vg.no|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 August, after receiving dozens of reports of forced entries, Norwegian police started plotting Larsen's itinerary on the map. Police detectives read the terrain and calculated Larsen's likely next step. They then arranged for police units to stay one step ahead of him. The plan worked, and they managed to track Larsen down when a police patrol found him walking on the mountainous border between [[Lom, Norway|Lom]] and [[Skjåk]]. He was handcuffed and escorted under heavy guard a few kilometers through the steep and difficult terrain to the nearest road, before being transported back to prison in [[Hønefoss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Larsen|first=Mads|title=Vandreren overlistet i natt|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2001/08/19/275671.html|accessdate=26 July 2013|newspaper=Dagbladet.no|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 August 2005, Larsen was again released on probation, but once again he disappeared into the woods. Almost immediately after, police were flooded with reports about break-ins in lodges and cottages throughout [[Buskerud]] county. After receiving a tip-off, Larsen was apprehended on 10 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nyhetsbyrå|first=Avisenes|title="Vandreren" tatt igjen|url=http://www.ringblad.no/Innenriks/krim/article1776161.ece|accessdate=26 July 2013|newspaper=Ringblad.no|date=10 October 2005|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He confessed to having burglarized 70 cabins in [[Sigdal]], [[Modum]], [[Øvre Eiker]] and [[Ringerike (municipality)|Ringerike]]. He was sentenced to a further 2 years and 6 months in February the next year.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite news|last=Andersen|first=Christian|title=Vandreren fikk 2,5 års fengsel|url=http://www.ringblad.no/nyheter/article1974237.ece|accessdate=26 July 2013|newspaper=Ringblad.no|date=26 February 2006|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larsen was subsequently incarcerated in [[Ringerike Prison]]. In 2007, he was brutally assaulted by a fellow inmate after an altercation, causing him to suffer a [[cerebral hemorrhage]], requiring life-saving surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sæter|first=Kjetil|title=Fortsatt kritisk for "Vandreren"|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1711517.ece#.UfKlu0Bwtng|accessdate=26 July 2013|date=27 March 2007|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hiatus and return to crime ==
After being released from prison some time after 2008, he spent some time at a psychiatric hospital, being treated for [[anxiety]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jahren|first=Audun|title=Tre år for "Vandreren"-vold|url=http://www.ringblad.no/nyheter/article3636098.ece|accessdate=26 July 2013|newspaper=Ringblad.no|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larsen spent many years out of the public eye, without committing serious offenses. On 23 July 2013 however, when the Kirkvoll family entered their mountain lodge at [[Geilo]] they found it broken into and vandalized. They also found Larsen heavily intoxicated sleeping in one of the bedrooms. When they confronted him, he introduced himself before running out and disappearing into the nearby woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Skarvøy|first=Lars Joakim|title=Politiet tror "Vandreren" har gjort nytt innbrudd|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10118623|accessdate=26 July 2013|newspaper=Vg.no|date=23 July 2013|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 July, he was arrested outside Geilo, and subsequently confessed to seven additional break-ins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hvidtsten|first=Ingrid|title="Vandreren" innrømmer flere hytteinnbrudd|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10105595|accessdate=31 July 2013|newspaper=Vg.no|date=31 July 2013|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modus operandi==
Although convicted 14 times of 664 separate break-ins, he is suspected of carrying out thousands. This is due to his [[modus operandi]] remaining unchanged throughout the years. After breaking into an unoccupied cabin or lodge, Larsen would typically live there for several nights, drinking all of the alcohol he could find (Larsen was a long-time [[alcoholic]], and was a recovering drug-addict) as well as eating all of the food.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Orø|first=Marit|title=Frykter "Vandreren" står bak hytteinnbrudd|url=http://www.ringblad.no/nyheter/article1733486.ece|accessdate=26 July 2013|newspaper=Ringblad.no|date=9 May 2005|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owners have also described scenes of vomit and urine, while leaving a "signature" of excrement on the living room floor was considered Larsen's [[trademark]]. He also typically stole outdoors-equipment such as sleeping bags and clothing, which he needed for wandering the wilderness.

'''Tim Page''' (born October 11, 1954) is a writer, editor, [[music critic]], producer and professor. He is a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning music critic, the editor and biographer of the American author [[Dawn Powell]], and the chronicler of his own experiences growing up with undiagnosed [[Asperger syndrome]].

==Biography==
Page was born in [[San Diego, California]]. He grew up in [[Storrs, Connecticut]], where his father, [[Ellis Batten Page]], was a professor of education at the [[University of Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/23/national/23page.html?_r=0|title=Ellis Page : Obituary|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, he was the subject of a short documentary, ''A Day With Timmy Page'', that chronicled his early interest in filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.uconn.edu/about/giving/how-giving-helps/tim-page-patron-of-the-music-collection |title=Tim Page: Patron of the Music Collection &amp;#124; University Libraries |publisher=Lib.uconn.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page moved to New York in 1975, attended the [[Mannes College The New School for Music]] for two years, and then transferred to [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=pulitzer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/biography/1997-Criticism |title=The Pulitzer Prizes &amp;#124; Biography |publisher=Pulitzer.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his graduation in 1979, Page was writing for the arts magazine ''Soho News'' and other publications and hosting a contemporary music program on the Columbia radio station, [[WKCR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/30/archives/the-pop-life-fusion-wkcr-and-the-tomato-label.html?sq=tim%2520page%2520wkcr&amp;scp=1&amp;st=cse | title=The Pop Life; 'Fusion,' WKCR and the Tomato label | newspaper=''[[The New York Times]]'' | first=John | last=Rockwell | date=March 30, 1979 | accessdate=January 5, 2012}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, he began an 11-year association with [[WNYC|WNYC-FM]], where he presented an afternoon program that broadcast interviews with composers and musicians, including [[Aaron Copland]], [[Virgil Thomson]], [[Philip Glass]] and [[Steve Reich]].&lt;ref name=USC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.usc.edu/tim-page/ |title=Tim Page &amp;#124; USC Thornton School of Music |publisher=Music.usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interview with [[Glenn Gould]], comparing the pianist's [[The Goldberg Variations (Gould album)|two versions]] of [[Bach]]'s ''[[Goldberg Variations]]'', was released as part of a three-CD set entitled ''[[A State of Wonder|A State of Wonder: The Complete Goldberg Variations 1955 &amp; 1981]]'' in 2002.&lt;ref name=USC/&gt; In 1982, Page joined ''[[The New York Times]]'', where he was a music writer and culture reporter until 1987,&lt;ref name=USC/&gt; and he became chief music critic of ''[[Newsday]]'' in 1987.&lt;ref name=pulitzer/&gt;

Page was appointed the chief classical music critic of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 1995,&lt;ref name=pulitzer/&gt; and in 1997 he was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Criticism]] for what the Pulitzer board called his "lucid and illuminating music criticism";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/1997-Criticism |title=The 1997 Pulitzer Prize Winners: Criticism|publisher=Pulitzer.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}} &lt;/ref&gt; in the preceding year he had written subjects that included the decline of classical music recordings and the position of the violin section in the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McAllister|first1=Bill|title=Post Music Critic Tim Page Wins Pulitzer; Newspapers in Seattle, New Orleans Each Receive Two Awards|work=The Washington Post|date=April 8, 1997|page=A.01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written widely on film and literature for the ''Post'' and elsewhere. Page edited works of [[Dawn Powell]], beginning in the 1990s, and wrote a biography of the author, ''Dawn Powell: A Biography'' (1998). He later edited and annotated the [[Library of America]]'s two-volume collection of Powell's work published in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dawn Powell |url=http://www.loa.org/volume.jsp?RequestID=169 |title=Dawn Powell Novels 1930–1942 (The Library of America) |publisher=Loa.org |date=2001-09-01 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Page served as the first executive producer for BMG Catalyst, a short-lived record label. Projects included ''Spiked'', an album of music by [[Spike Jones]] with liner notes by [[Thomas Pynchon]]; ''Memento Bittersweet'', an album of music by Chris DeBlasio, Kevin Oldham, Lee Gannon and other composers; ''Night of the Mayas'', the first CD devoted entirely to orchestral works by [[Silvestre Revueltas]], Mexico's leading composer; two solo recital discs by violinist Maria Bachmann and several others.&lt;ref name=USC/&gt; [[Bruce Brubaker (musician)|Bruce Brubaker]] recounted how Page introduced him to [[Philip Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce Brubaker |url=http://www.artsjournal.com/pianomorphosis/2009/06/first_glass.html |title=First Glass &amp;#124; PianoMorphosis |publisher=Artsjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page has also produced concerts at venues ranging from [[Carnegie Hall]] to New York's [[Mudd Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://annenberg.usc.edu/faculty/journalism/tim-page ''Professor Tim Page''].  Staff Profile.  [[University of Southern California]].  (USA).&lt;/ref&gt; From 1999 to 2001, he was the artistic advisor and creative chair for the [[St. Louis Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref name=USC2&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/music/private/faculty/ellispag.php |title=Faculty Search &amp;#124; USC Thornton School of Music |publisher=Usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has helped launch revivals of the writings of [[Sigrid Undset]] and [[Robert Green Ingersoll]], and he wrote an appreciation of the late singer-songwriter [[Judee Sill]], whom Page considers "an artist of extraordinary gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/29/AR2006122901782.html | title=A Brief Life, an Enduring Musical Impression | first=Tim | last=Page | publisher=''The Washington Post'' | date=December 30, 2006 | accessdate=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On solo careers for child artists, Page has written skeptically, calling them "unwarranted exposure", and writing "the cult of the prodigy has always struck me as one of the most debased aspects of the music world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Page |first=Tim |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/talented-young-musicians-run-the-risk-of-burning-out-early/2011/12/23/gIQANhUeQP_story.html |title=Talented young musicians run the risk of burning out early |publisher=The Washington Post |date=December 30, 2011 |accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote: "I mistrust the "cute kid" brigade for two principal reasons: It is deeply exploitative and often ruinous to young artists, and it transforms age&amp;nbsp;... into a liability for more seasoned players."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/music/features/timpagebye.htm | title=A Critic's Closing Lines: Tim Page, Leaving on A Fond &amp; Hopeful Note | publisher=''The Washington Post'' | first=Tim | last=Page | date=July 11, 1999|page= G01 | accessdate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand he was an early champion of [[Midori Gotō]], about whom he wrote a profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/29/arts/unpretentious-prodigy-puzzled-by-all-the-fuss.htm|title = Unpretentious Prodigy Puzzled by All the Fuss|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date = July 29, 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Page has also written on [[Frederica von Stade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/22/arts/von-stade-conquers-her-fear-of-the-contemporary.html|title=Von Stade Conquers Her Fear of the Contemporary|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Magnetic Fields|Magnetic Fields]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9rK8hKqO7YC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=tim+page+magnetic+fields&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1cP919w2v7&amp;sig=ezTAIBpRuTYcXizkgagLz_ZzK5A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UDnmVKDBM9OTNvX9gPgN&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20page%20magnetic%20fields&amp;f=false |title=Tim Page on Music: Views and Reviews - Tim Page - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2000-05-07 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[High Llamas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9rK8hKqO7YC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=high+llamas+tim+page&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1cP919w3r2&amp;sig=rrct6QS_Ufs8kHImRMHLydXRMKM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iDnmVIi0F8KrggTrmISQDA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=high%20llamas%20tim%20page&amp;f=false |title=Tim Page on Music: Views and Reviews - Tim Page - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007 Page sent an e-mail from his ''Post'' account in response to an unsolicited press release about former Washington mayor [[Marion Barry]]'s views concerning a hospital. Page's e-mail read: "Must we hear about it every time this crack addict attempts to rehabilitate himself with some new – and typically half-witted – political grandstanding? ... I cannot think of anything the useless Marion Barry could do that would interest me in the slightest, up to and including overdose."  Page apologized but claimed that Barry's aide had been rude to him in a previous request to be taken off the e-mail list. The aide denied any previous contact with Page.&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz, Howard.

After leaving the ''Post'' in 2007, Page was named a professor of journalism and music at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://annenberg.usc.edu/Faculty/Communication%20and%20Journalism/PageT.aspx |title=USC Annenberg &amp;#124; Tim Page |publisher=Annenberg.usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently lives in [[South Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Lucey |url=http://www.newspaperalum.com/2012/06/tim-page-former-washington-post-music-critic-opened-a-new-chapter-of-his-life-at-usc.html |title=Tim Page, Former Washington Post Music Critic, Opened a New Chapter of His Life at USC |publisher=NewspaperAlum |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he was appointed "Visiting Scholar in Residence" at Oberlin College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weisblum|first=Vida|url=http://www.oberlinreview.org/7376/arts/on-the-record-tim-page-acclaimed-music-critic-and-visiting-scholar/|title=On the Record: Tim Page, Acclaimed Music Critic and Visiting Scholar|date=February 13, 2015|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asperger syndrome===
In August 2007 Page revealed in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that he had been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, "in the course of a protracted effort to identify – and, if possible, alleviate – my lifelong unease".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/08/20/070820fa_fact_page | title=Parallel Play: A lifetime of restless isolation explained | publisher=''The New Yorker'' | first=Tim | last=Page | date=August 20, 2007 | accessdate=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book-length memoir ''[[Parallel Play (memoir by Tim Page)|Parallel Play]]'' was published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in September 2009 and is about his experience growing up with the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/10/21/DI2009102103314.html |title=Living with Asperger's syndrome |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Page does not glorify or mythologize his condition, nor does he render a portrait of a soul victimized by circumstance", Samantha Dunn wrote in her review for the ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-tim-page6-2009sep06-story.html |title='Parallel Play: Growing Up With Undiagnosed Asperger's' by Tim Page |publisher=LA Times |date=2009-09-06 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Titusz Dugovics''' or '''Titus Dugović''' ({{lang-hu|Dugovics Titusz}}; * ? ; † 21 July 1456) was a mythical [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] soldier of [[Croatians|Croatian]] or [[Serbs|Serbian]] ethnicity who was stationed during the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s forces in Belgrade. However, the historical truth of his existence is in some doubt, because all known records that describe him are of highly questionable veracity.&lt;ref name="mult-kor"/&gt;

==The siege==
Nándorfehérvár ([[Belgrade]]) was at this time under the command of Hunyadi. From 4 to 22 July 1456, Nándorfehérvár was besieged by the Sultan [[Mehmed II]]. After ongoing, fierce battles, Ottoman troops attacked the city walls on 21 July, and a [[Janissary]] succeeded, according to legend, to climb a turret and momentarily hoist the Ottoman banner.  It was immediately overthrown by soldiers in the same moment that Dugovics grabbed the bearer. As a result, both Dugovics and the standard-bearer plunged from the walls to their deaths.

This heroic act was significant in the repulse of the Ottomans and honours the memory of the defenders of Nándorfehérvár.

==Fictional person?==
In his study,&lt;ref&gt;Szőcs 2009, p. 3–35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[historian]] Tibor Szőcs claims Titusz Dugovics did not exist. A familiar figure in Hungarian history, Dugovics is the embodiment of anti-Ottoman resistance and self-sacrifice. This heroic deed by him has served as the subject of numerous works of literature and art since the middle of the 19th century, and several streets in Hungary have been named after him.

Nevertheless, an analysis of the available sources proves that the story cannot be considered as historically accurate. The heroic act was first documented in [[Antonio Bonfini]]'s chronicle written at the end of the 15th century, where an anonymous Hungarian fighter is mentioned. The same story is told by both Bonfini and the Serbian [[Konstantin Mihailović]], in relation to the [[Siege of Jajce]] in 1464, featuring an unnamed soldier as well. Early modern-era Czech historical literature by [[Jan Dubravius]] also refers to the hero of Belgrade/Nándorfehérvár as being unknown, but defining his nationality as [[Czech people|Czech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

From the end of the 18th century, with the forming of Hungarian national consciousness, the valiant soldier had been regarded as a national hero and role model. Imre Dugovics, a member of the [[Hungarian nobility|Western Hungarian noble family]] of Croatian origin, took advantage of that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hvg.hu/Tudomany.tortenelem/20100107_dugovics_titusz_legendaja.aspx?s=24h Dugovics Titusz legendája kipukkadt]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, by means of three false documents, he attempted to verify that the anonymous fighter had been an ancestor of his family, called Titusz Dugovics. The name was made known to the public by Gábor Döbrentei, a recognised scholar of the period, who had been deceived by the false documents, and published them in study.&lt;ref name="mult-kor"/&gt; Thus, Titusz Dugovics and his story soon became (and have ever since remained) a part of Hungarian historical consciousness, although his character should not be considered more than early-19th-century fiction. The only element of the story that may be accepted as authentic is that of the unknown soldier described by Bonfini and Konstantin.&lt;ref name="mult-kor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mult-kor.hu/20090619_igy_lett_romantikus_nemzetkepunk_hose_dugovics_titusz |title=Így lett romantikus nemzetképünk hőse Dugovics Titusz |publisher=www.mult-kor.hu |accessdate=7 May 2012}} (Hungarian text: " A 15. századi források vizsgálata azt mutatja, hogy keringett valamiféle történet egy ismeretlen katonáról, aki így adta bizonyságát hősiességének. A 18-19. század fordulóján ezt a vitéz tettet fedezte fel újra a magyar történelmi emlékezet, amely a romantikus nemzeti múlt-kép egyik fontos epizódja lett. Az 1820-as évek elején ezt a hírességet használta ki Dugovics Imre, aki saját családját kívánta rokonságba hozni a belgrádi hőssel. Céljai elérése érdekében a hamis oklevelek gyártatásától sem riadt vissza. Azonban ő sem gondolta, hogy Döbrentei Gábor lelkesedésének köszönhetően Dugovics Titusz alakja bekerül a nemzeti panteonba. " - 

Translation: "The 15th-century sources show that there was a story about an unknown soldier who proved his bravery by his action. At the turn of the 19th century the Hungarian historical memory re-explored this heroic deed, which thus became an important part of the nation's romantic past. At the beginning of the 1820s, a certain Imre Dugovics took advantage of this famous act when he wanted to establish a relationship between his family and the hero of Belgrade. He actually  falsified records to achieve his aim, but even he never counted on Titusz Dugovics making it into the national pantheon by historian Gábor Döbrentei's enthusiasm")&lt;/ref&gt;
