'''''2B''''' is a 2009 [[science fiction film]] directed by Richard Kroehling and starring [[James Remar]]. It is based on the ideas of [[transhumanism]] and the [[technological singularity]]. The film was released on October 2, 2009 at the [[Woodstock Film Festival]]. It was produced in conjunction with [[Terasem Movement|Terasem Media and Films]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terasemmovementfoundation.com/mission About the Terasem Movement Foundation Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Set in the near future, ''2B'' portrays a familiar decaying world on the cusp of "great transformation and awesome wonders". The story is based upon real science and evolving technologies. When the world's first transhuman is created by a renegade corporate CEO and bioscientist, the foundations of society's beliefs are threatened in a transhuman world where man merges with technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodstockfilmfestival.com/festival2009/details.php?id=20876 World Premiere, [[Woodstock Film Festival]], Retrieved 2012-06-05]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4422">'''4G-LTE filter''' is a [[low-pass filter]], to be used in [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]]-reception installations (both [[collective]] and individual) if one wants to keep the old [[UHF]] [[TV antenna]], previously installed, without the risk of [[Adjacent-channel interference|interference]]s caused by the 4G-LTE transmitters,&lt;ref name=interference&gt;{{cite book|title=Brouillage des fréquences TNT par la 4G|url=http://pro.clubic.com/technologie-et-politique/actualite-444336-tnt-4g-besson-bouygues.html|publisher=Clubic.com|pages=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latest standard generation of [[cellphones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guide pratique World_ENG_Final|url=http://www.entreprises.gouv.fr/files/files/guides/guide-pratique-world.pdf|publisher=French government|pages=–|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These filters are only required for existing facilities as for new installations in urban or rural areas, antennas and amplifiers sold from the application of the new standard should already be configured to receive, with good signal gain, only [[Television|TV channels]] from 21 to 60 of the UHF band, the other higher channels (former TV channels 61 to 69)  being attenuated.

== Interference between 4G LTE and DTT ==


4G LTE is the fourth generation mobile phone standard. In urban areas, the 4G uses a frequency band located between 2500&amp;nbsp;MHz and 2600&amp;nbsp;MHz, and therefore is quite far from the TV band for causing any type of interference problem.

In rural areas, however, the major operators have asked to use part of the UHF band. Since the UHF frequency band is not expandable, it was agreed that television broadcasting should limit its number of channels. Thus, the frequency band dedicated to the TV will be between 470&amp;nbsp;MHz and 790&amp;nbsp;MHz (channels 21-60), and the 4G LTE will use the frequency band between 790 and 860&amp;nbsp;MHz (former TV channels 61 to 69) being the interval separating the two bands (DTT and 4G) of only 1&amp;nbsp;MHz, so that there is a risk of [[Adjacent-channel interference|interference]]s &lt;ref name=interference/&gt; in the areas close to the [[4G-LTE]] transmitting towers.&lt;ref name=interference/&gt;  In practice, the band used (790 to 862&amp;nbsp;MHz),{{clarify|reason=in view of the band used?, in the band used?|date=December 2014}} called [[Digital dividend]], this will not become a real problem until 2015 (or the start of the 4G deployment in these areas).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiredstore.com.au/2018/07/18/can-the-4g-lte-cause-interference-tv-reception/|title=Can the 4G LTE signal cause interference to your TV reception? - Wired Store|website=wiredstore.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital dividend==

[[File:Dividendo-Digital.jpg|thumb|650px|Graphic description of the Digital Dividend use]]
[[Digital dividend]] to frequency 06&amp;nbsp;MHz (TV Channels 61 to 69) assigned by the plan for the New UHF Frequency Band distribution agreed in ''The World Radio Congress (WRC-07)'' which identified 108&amp;nbsp;MHz of Digital Dividend Spectrum from 698 to 806&amp;nbsp;MHz for ITU-R Regions 2-1 and nine countries in Regions 3-2, including China, India, Japan and Rep. of Korea.&lt;ref name= dividend&gt;{{cite book|title=The benefits of digital dividend|url=http://www.4gamericas.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/benefits-digital-dividend-americas/|publisher=www.4gamericas.org|pages=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Digital dividend is used to improve the coverage of the 4G-LTE new standard in rural areas, needed with the arrival of 4G-LTE and requires therefore the redistribution of UHF frequency band. Starting from January 2015 (in some countries), the main mobile operators will begin to deploy their networks of very high band width "True 4G" or LTE using the frequency previously attributed to TV Channels 61 to 69, which is known as "digital dividend".&lt;ref name= dividend/&gt;

'''''5 Flights Up''''' (released in the United Kingdom as '''''Ruth &amp; Alex''''') is a 2014 American [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Richard Loncraine]], written by Charlie Peters, and starring [[Morgan Freeman]] and [[Diane Keaton]]. The film, based on the novel ''Heroic Measures'' by [[Jill Ciment]], was released on May 8, 2015, by [[Focus World]].

==Plot==
Alex and Ruth Carver, an older couple, want to move because living in a 5-story walk-up is too difficult without an elevator. Alex is a painter and uses one of the rooms as his studio. Ruth is a retired school teacher. They have lived there so many years that it and the neighborhood have become intertwined with their lives. Their niece Lilly is their broker who believes the apartment is worth up to $1M.

Three other plot lines develop simultaneously with the sale of the apartment. One is the problem with the Carvers' old dog Dorothy who gets a ruptured disc and the issue of how much money to spend to help her. The second is an ongoing news story about a driver of a disabled tanker truck, a supposed terrorist, on the bridge near the Carvers' apartment. The third is the Carvers looking at new apartments.

The vet tells them that an operation costing $10,000 might fix Dorothy's ruptured disk. Alex is against it at first but later agrees with Ruth that they have to do whatever it takes to save Dorothy. After the operation, Dorothy is still unable to move her legs. Toward the end of the movie, while still under the care of the vet, Dorothy starts walking again.

In their search for a replacement apartment, Ruth finds one she really likes, and their offer is accepted. However, the sellers' agent wants a deposit check that evening or it will go back out to bid. When Alex, Ruth, and Lilly arrive at the apartment to write the deposit, the owners tell them it's not enough. Meanwhile, the news reports that the driver of the tanker has been apprehended. Alex is startled that the driver is "just a kid".

Alex does not like the owners' attitude and refuses to write a deposit check. Alex and Ruth leave. As they are leaving, Lilly finds out that the Carvers are no longer interested in selling their apartment. She flips them off and walks away.

The film ends with Alex walking Dorothy up the stairs to their apartment in the winter. He sees a young couple moving into their building, similar to when he and Ruth first moved in 40 years ago.

The A-7 is a portable man-pack, radio transceiver with narrow-band frequency modulation. The set can be used as a radio telephone in a wired network and managed remotely. Setting the frequency of the receiver and transmitter circuits is adjusted in tandem by one control handle. The antenna and buffer oscillator circuits are common for the receiving and transmitting circuits.

The receiver section is a [[superheterodyne]] design with a single frequency conversion, consisting of 8 identical 2K2M [[Vacuum tubes|valves]]. A regenerative detector with adjustable feedback is used. The transmitter section includes a 2K2M modulator valve, a CO-257 buffer amplifier valve, and a CO-257 power amplifier valve. Switching from reception to transmission is achieved by switching the power from the heater circuits of the receiver and transmitter valves, alternately.&lt;ref name = "User manual"&gt;http://www.rkk-museum.ru/documents/archives/images/2-43-01.pdf User manual. Retrieved 15 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transceiver with power supplies and accessories is housed in a wooden box with shoulder straps for carrying as a backpack. For long distances, the set is carried by two soldiers. The set only requires one radio operator. The deployment time is typically not more than 5 minutes.

*Frequency range: 27-32&amp;nbsp;MHz.
*Number of frequency channels: 101.
*Transmitter output power: 1W.
*Sensitivity of the receiver: 1-1.5 μV.&lt;ref name = "User manual"/&gt;
*Intermediate frequency: 1100&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name = "User manual"/&gt;
*Antennas: a whip with a height of 2.5 m or a flexible wire 6.4 m long.&lt;ref name = "User manual"/&gt;
*Range of action:
**On rough terrain - up to 7–8&amp;nbsp;km.
**On urban conditions - 3–4&amp;nbsp;km.
**On slightly cross-country terrain outside of buildings - 10&amp;nbsp;km and more.
*Power source: two dry anode batteries BAS-80 with a total voltage of 160 V and two 2 NKN-10 nickel-cadmium batteries. The time of continuous operation from one set is 35–40 hours.&lt;ref name = "User manual"/&gt;
*Dimensions of the transceiver (without protruding parts): 285 × 135 × 165&amp;nbsp;mm.
*Dimensions of the packing box: 210 × 385 × 330&amp;nbsp;mm.
*Mass of the radio station: 15.5&amp;nbsp;kg, the battery weighs 6&amp;nbsp;kg.

===A-7a===
A-7a is a simplified version of the A-7. The total number of valves was reduced to 9. In the transmitter section, the functions of the modulator and power amplifier were combined into one valve, and in the receiver section one valve was used to simultaneously perform the functions of a high-frequency and low-frequency amplifier (the so-called [[Reflex receiver|reflex circuit]]). The ability to work by telegraph was removed. Energy consumption was decreased by about 30%, other main characteristics were not changed. The A-7a set was manufactured by various factories in several different variants: with and without a tone button, with one or two measuring instruments, etc.

===A-7b===
[[File:РАДИОСТАНЦИЯ А-7-Б.jpg|thumb|A-7b]]
A-7b is a 10 valve version introduced in 1945. In the transmitter section two output valves are used in parallel. The transmitting range was increased by around 50%. The frequency range is 24-28&amp;nbsp;MHz. There is no feedback adjustment in the detector circuit.

The A-7b was also manufactured from 1950 to 1956 in Pardubice, Czechoslovakia by the [[Tesla (Czechoslovak company)|Tesla]] company.

'''Aguinaldo''' is a [[folk music|folk]] [[genre]] of [[Christmas]] music in several [[Latin America]]n countries, based on Spanish [[Christmas carol]]s or [[villancicos]] which is traditionally sung on Christmas itself or during the [[holiday season]]. Aguinaldo music is often performed by ''parrandas'' - a casual group of people, often family or friends, who merrily go from house to house taking along their singing.

== Venezuelan aguinaldo ==
In [[Venezuela]], ''aguinaldo'' is a genre of [[Christmas]] music and generally have six verses. Played by "parranderos" or "aguinalderos"  that announce their arrival in song and seek to gain entry to the community houses to relate the story of the birth of Christ, and to share in the joy of the message of Peace on Earth and to all People of Good Will. Aguinaldos are played with typical instruments such as the [[Cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]] (a small, four-string guitar), [[Friction drum|furruco]], and [[maracas]]. Other instruments often used are [[violin]], [[guitar]], [[tambourine]], [[mandolin]], [[bandol (instrument)|bandol]], [[caja vallenata|caja]] (a percussive box instrument), and [[marímbula]] (an Afro-Venezuelan instrument). In exchange for the entertainment, "parranderos" are traditionally given food and drink: [[hallaca]]s, [[panettone]], [[rum]] and "Ponche Crema" (a form of alcoholic [[eggnog]]).  Aguinaldos are also played at Christmas church celebrations.

== Puerto Rican aguinaldo ==
[[File:Phoenix-Musical Instrument Museum-Puerto Rican Güiro.jpg|150px|thumb|Puerto Rican Güiro]] 
In [[Puerto Rico]], the ''aguinaldo'' is a musical gift offered during the [[Christmas]] season and is a tradition inherited from the island's Spanish colonizers.  As a musical gift, aguinaldos are mostly played by "parranderos" or "trullas" during the Christmas holidays. This is a practice that is slowly being lost.&lt;ref name="Puerto Rican Aguinaldo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mason|first1=J. Alden|last2=Espinosa|first2=Aurelio M.|title=Porto-Rican Folk-Lore. Décimas, Christmas Carols, Nursery Rhymes, and Other Songs|journal=The Journal of American Folklore,|date=1918|volume=31|issue=121|pages=289-450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, ''aguinaldos'' were  "[[villancicos]]" with strong religious connotations but soon evolved to "[[Copla (music)|coplas]]" (quartets) and "decimas" (ten-verses compositions) about all kinds of everyday topics. Aguinaldos were played with typical instruments such as the [[bordonúa]], a [[tiple]], a [[Cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]], a carracho or [[güiro]], a [[cowbell]], [[barriles de bomba]], an [[accordion]], and [[maracas]]. With bordonua players becoming more difficult to find, the [[guitar]] became a staple accompanying the cuatro. Today, panderos (also known as "[[pandereta plenera|plenera]]s"), brass instruments and whatever makes noise, are used.&lt;ref name="Puerto Rican Aguinaldo" /&gt;

As a genre, the ''aguinaldo'' is played mostly on the radio on key Christmas holidays in Puerto Rico; the day before Christmas and in Christmas, on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, and the day before Three Kings Day and on Three King's Day (January 6). Aguinaldos are also played at Christmas church celebrations.&lt;ref name="Puerto Rican Aguinaldo" /&gt;

== Philippine aguinaldo ==
In the [[Philippines]], the word ''aguinaldo'' has come to refer instead to the gift&amp;mdash;usually cash or coins&amp;mdash;collected by small groups of children that go [[Christmas in the Philippines#Caroling|carolling]]. A traditional instrument used is a makeshift tambourine made of several ''tansan'' (aluminium [[bottle cap]]s) strung on some wire. Carollers solicit homeowners with the chant "''Namamasko po!''" (approx. "wassailing!"), and after singing wait to be rewarded with ''aguinaldo''.

== Trinidadian aguinaldo ==
Aguinaldo or Serenal is a music genre used in [[Parang]] (Parranda) a type of Christmas music that came to [[Trinidad and Tobago]] from [[Venezuela]]. Singers and instrumentalists (collectively known as  "parranderos") travel from house to house in the community, often joined by friends and neighbours family, using whatever instruments are to hand. Popular parang instruments include the [[Cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]] and maracas (locally known as chac-chacs).

The [[United States|American]] '''Theater Hall of Fame''' in [[New York City]] was founded in 1972. Earl Blackwell was the first head of the organization's Executive Committee. In an announcement in 1972, he said that the new ''Theater Hall of Fame'' would be located in the [[Uris Theatre]] (then under construction, now the Gershwin). [[Nederlander Organization|James M. Nederlander]] and Gerard Oestreicher, who leased the theatre, donated the space for the Hall of Fame; Arnold Weissberger was another founder. Blackwell noted that the names of the first honorees would "be embossed in bronze-gold lettering on the theater's entrance walls flanking its grand staircase and escalator."&lt;ref&gt;Calta, Louis. "A Hall of Fame for the Theater To Honor Outstanding Figures", ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 7, 1972, {{ISSN|0362-4331}}, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  The first group of inductees was announced in October 1972.&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/10/27/91353154.pdf| title=Uris Hall of Fame Names First Group| work=The New York Times|date=October 27, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eligible inductees come from disciplines including actors, playwrights, song writers, designers, directors and producers who have had a career in American theater for at least twenty-five years and, at least five major production credits on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].&lt;ref name=atca/&gt;&lt;ref name=hodges&gt;{{cite book| last=Hodges| first=Ben| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yGx3tLELoEoC&amp;pg=PA394| title=The Theater Hall of Fame| series=Theatre World (2008-2009)|  volume=65| publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation| year=2009| isbn=978-1423473695| pages=393-394}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has since been modified.{{cn|date=December 2016}} Selections are made each year by voting members of the Theater Hall of Fame and the [[American Theatre Critics Association]] (ATCA). Induction takes place at a ceremony at the [[Gershwin Theatre]] in New York City, where the plaques containing the names of the inductees are hung.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08030/853132-42.stm "Hall of Fame: theater veterans get a night in limelight"],''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', January 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, full accounts of the annual induction ceremonies, with quotes from both inductees and their presenters, have appeared in the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''.

===Bandai Entertainment===
{{see also|:Category:Bandai Entertainment anime titles}} 
Bandai Entertainment is a defunct subsidiary of Bandai America, founded in 1998.&lt;ref name="goliath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/product-compint-0001127396-page.html|title=Bandai Entertainment Inc.|publisher=Goliath|accessdate=2007-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bei-about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandai-ent.com/about/ |title=Bandai Entertainment |accessdate=2007-07-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627171734/http://www.bandai-ent.com/about/ |archivedate=June 27, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first releases were under the AnimeVillage.com label up until 1999 when Bandai Entertainment started releasing its titles. Despite its name it was not directly established by Bandai Visual. Originally separate from Bandai Visual USA, Bandai Namco Holdings announced that Bandai Entertainment would absorb Bandai Visual USA in 2008.&lt;ref name="USAEnd" /&gt; Headquartered in [[Cypress, California]], it licensed [[anime]] properties from various Japanese companies for North American distribution; most of those licenses coming from Bandai and its sister company [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]]. The company also licensed [[manga]] series for release with English translation, and published American-made [[graphic novel]]s.&lt;ref name="bei-manga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandai-ent.com/products/manga.cfm |title=Bandai Entertainment |accessdate=2007-07-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717210717/http://www.bandai-ent.com/products/manga.cfm |archivedate=July 17, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many North American anime distributors, Bandai Entertainment offered a 'fan support' program to facilitate public screenings of licensed content at [[anime club]]s and [[anime convention]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-12-02/bandai-announces-anime-club-support-progam|title=Bandai announces anime club support program|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2002-12-02|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company confirmed on January 2, 2012 that they would stop offering new DVD, Blu-ray disc and manga releases by February, but would continue to produce their current library of content. Bandai Entertainment was restructured to focus on licensing anime to other companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-02/bandai-entertainment-to-stop-releasing-new-dvds-bds-manga|title=Bandai Entertainment to Stop Releasing New DVDs, BDs, Manga|date=2012-01-02|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 30, 2012, Bandai America announced that it will shut down Bandai Entertainment and discontinue distributing their home video and print catalog on March 1, 2013. They made their final shipment to retailers on November 30, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bandai Entertainment to Discontinue Home Video, Manga, Novel Sales|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-08-31/bandai-entertainment-to-discontinue-home-video-manga-novel-sales|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many former Bandai Entertainment titles have been re-licensed by companies like [[Funimation]], [[Aniplex of America]], [[Discotek Media]], [[Nozomi Entertainment]] &amp; [[Sentai Filmworks]].
====Beez Entertainment====
Beez Entertainment was the European branch of Bandai Entertainment that also distributed anime and music and were also owned by Bandai Namco Holdings.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beez.fr/company.php?&amp;lng=en | title=About Beez: Company Profile | publisher=Beez Entertainment | accessdate=2007-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is an acronym for Bandai Entertainment European Zone. Following the discontinuation of Bandai Entertainment, Beez has also stopped releasing anime in the European market.&lt;ref name="animenewsnetwork.com"&gt;[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-05/france-beez-entertainment-stops-releasing-new-anime France's Beez Entertainment Stops Releasing New Anime - News]. Anime News Network (2012-01-05). Retrieved on 2014-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Their anime releases were licensed in North America by Bandai Entertainment and Bandai Visual USA.

===Bandai Visual USA===
Bandai Visual USA was established in 2005 to distribute and market Bandai Visual's productions in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bandai Visual Establishes US Office|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-01-24/bandai-visual-establishes-us-office|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Bandai Entertainment, Bandai Visual USA's releases were of high quality and were aimed at collectors. Their titles were released under the Honnêamise label (named after their Bandai Visual's first production, [[Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise]]).  Bandai Visual USA's anime products were distributed in North America initially by [[Image Entertainment]] and later, [[Geneon Universal Entertainment|Geneon Entertainment USA]] and in Europe by [[Beez Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bandai Visual USA to Launch Honneamise Label|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-12-05/bandai-visual-usa-to-launch-honneamise-label|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bandai Visual USA New Licenses and Distribution Label|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-03-05/bandai-visual-usa-new-licenses-and-distribution-deal|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 23, 2008, Bandai Namco Holdings announced that Bandai Visual USA would be merged into Bandai Entertainment.&lt;ref name="USAEnd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-05-23/bandai-visual-usa-to-be-liquidated-by-september |title=Bandai Visual USA to be Liquidated by September |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2008-05-23 |accessdate=2008-05-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080525214216/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-05-23/bandai-visual-usa-to-be-liquidated-by-september| archivedate= May 25, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bandai Visual USA was dissolved on July 1, 2008.

====Honnêamise====
Honnêamise was Bandai Visual USA's boutique label that distributed deluxe editions of anime and artsier products. The label's namesake comes from ''[[Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise]]''. The label was shut down on July 1, 2008 when Bandai Visual USA was absorbed into Bandai Entertainment. The label's releases were distributed by [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan#Geneon USA|Geneon Entertainment USA]] and [[Image Entertainment]].

[[File:Metric levels.svg|thumb|350px|Metric levels: beat level shown in middle with division levels above and multiple levels below.]]

In [[music]] and [[music theory]], the '''beat''' is the basic unit of time, the [[pulse (music)|pulse]]{{cfn|date=October 2018}} (regularly repeating event), of the ''mensural level''&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Wallace (1976/1986). ''Structural Functions in Music'', p. 349. {{ISBN|0-486-25384-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (or ''beat level'').&lt;ref&gt;Winold, Allen (1975). "Rhythm in Twentieth-Century Music", ''Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music'', p. 213. With, Gary (ed.). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice–Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-049346-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The beat is often defined as the rhythm listeners would tap their toes to when listening to a piece of music, or the numbers a musician [[counting (music)|counts]] while performing, though in practice this may be technically incorrect (often the first multiple level). In popular use, ''beat'' can refer to a variety of related concepts including: [[pulse (music)|pulse]], [[tempo]], [[meter (music)|meter]], specific [[rhythm]]s, and [[groove (popular music)|groove]].

Rhythm in music is characterized by a repeating sequence of [[#On-beat and off-beat|stressed and unstressed beats]] (often called "strong" and "weak") and divided into [[bar (music)|bars]] organized by [[time signature]] and [[tempo]] indications.

[[Meter (music)#Metric structure|Metric levels]] faster than the beat level are division levels, and slower levels are multiple levels. Beat has always been an important part of music.  Some [[music genre]]s such as [[funk]] will in general de-emphasize the beat, while other such as [[disco]] emphasize the beat to accompany dance.&lt;ref name="hhd"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hip Hop Dance |last=Rajakumar |first=Mohanalakshmi |year=2012 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313378461 |page=5 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jGZhfy9UaGIC |accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Division==
{{Main|Metre (music)#Metric structure}}

As beats are combined to form measures, each beat is divided into parts. The nature of this combination and division is what determines meter. Music where two beats are combined is in [[duple meter]], music where three beats are combined is in [[triple meter]]. Music where the beat is split in two are in simple meter, music where the beat is split in three are called compound meter. Thus, simple duple (2/4, 4/4, 2/2, etc.), simple triple (3/4), compound duple (6/8), and compound triple (9/8). Divisions which require numbers, [[tuplet]]s (for example, dividing a quarter note into five equal parts), are irregular divisions and subdivisions. Subdivision begins two levels below the beat level: starting with a quarter note or a dotted quarter note, subdivision begins when the note is divided into sixteenth notes.

==Downbeat and upbeat==

The ''downbeat'' is the first beat of the [[bar (music)|bar]], i.e. number 1. The ''upbeat'' is the '''last beat''' in the '''previous bar''' which immediately '''precedes,''' and hence anticipates, the '''downbeat'''.&lt;ref name=Groveupbeat&gt;{{cite web |title=Upbeat |url=http://www.grovemusic.com|accessdate=2007-02-10 |last= Dogantan|first= Mine|year= 2007 |work=Oxford Music Online |publisher=Grove Music Online | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516041031/http://www.grovemusic.com/| archivedate=May 16, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both terms correspond to the direction taken by the hand of a [[conductor (music)|conductor]].

{{Quote|This idea of directionality of beats is significant when you translate '''its''' effect on music. The crusis of a measure or a phrase is a beginning; it propels sound and energy forward, so the sound needs to lift and have forward motion to create a sense of direction. The anacrusis leads to the crusis, but doesn't have the same 'explosion' of sound; it serves as a preparation for the crusis.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland, Kent D. and Dobrea-Grindahl, Mary (2013). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wvTSsKLSxWsC&amp;pg=PT34&amp;dq=anacrusis+example&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGwKqWiaPWAhVL82MKHVfyBAcQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=anacrusis%20example&amp;f=false Developing Musicianship Through Aural Skills]'', unpaginated. Routledge. {{ISBN|9781135173050}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An anticipatory note or succession of notes occurring before the first barline of a piece is sometimes referred to as an upbeat figure, section or phrase. Alternative expressions include "pickup" and "[[anacrusis]]" (the latter ultimately from Greek ''ana'' ["up towards"] and ''krousis'' ["strike"/"impact"] through French ''anacrouse''). In English, ''anákrousis'' translates literally as "pushing up". The term anacrusis was borrowed from the field of [[poetry]], in which it refers to one or more unstressed extrametrical [[syllable]]s at the beginning of a line.&lt;ref name=Groveupbeat/&gt;

==On-beat and off-beat==

In typical Western music [[Quadruple time|{{music|time|4|4}} time]], [[counting (music)|counted]] as "&lt;tt&gt;1&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;4, 1&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;4...&lt;/tt&gt;", the first beat of the bar (downbeat) is usually the strongest [[Accent (music)|accent]] in the melody and the likeliest place for a chord change, the third is the next strongest: these are "on" beats. The second and fourth are weaker—the "off-beats". Subdivisions (like eighth notes) that fall between the pulse beats are even weaker and these, if used frequently in a rhythm, can also make it "off-beat".&lt;ref name=beat&gt;{{cite web |title= Beat: Accentuation. (i) Strong and weak beats. |accessdate=2007-02-10 |url=http://www.grovemusic.com |year= 2007 |work=Oxford Music Online |publisher=Grove Music Online |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516041031/http://www.grovemusic.com/ |archivedate=May 16, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect can be easily simulated by evenly and repeatedly counting to four. As a background against which to compare these various rhythms a bass drum strike on the downbeat and a constant eighth note subdivision on ride cymbal have been added, which would be counted as follows ('''bold''' denotes a stressed beat):
* &lt;tt&gt;'''1''' 2 3 4 '''1''' 2 3 4&lt;/tt&gt;  —{{audio|Backbeat example eighth notes.mid|play eighth notes and bass drum alone}}
* &lt;tt&gt;'''1''' 2 '''3''' 4 '''1''' 2 '''3''' 4&lt;/tt&gt;—the stress here on the "on" beat {{audio|Backbeat example unsyncopated.mid|play}} But one may syncopate that pattern and alternately stress the odd and even beats, respectively:
*&lt;tt&gt;1 '''2''' 3 '''4''' 1 '''2''' 3 '''4'''&lt;/tt&gt; —the stress is on the unexpected" or syncopated beat {{audio|Backbeat example.mid|play}}

So "off-beat" is a musical term, commonly applied to [[syncopation]] that emphasizes the weak even beats of a bar, as opposed to the usual on-beat. This is a fundamental technique of [[African polyrhythm]] that transferred to popular western music. According to Grove Music, the "Offbeat is [often] where the downbeat is replaced by a rest or is tied over from the preceding bar".&lt;ref name=beat/&gt; The downbeat can never be the off-beat because it is the strongest beat in {{music|time|4|4}} time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Off-beat|url=http://www.grovemusic.com  |accessdate=2007-02-10 |year= 2007 |work=Oxford Music Online |publisher=Grove Music Online | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516041031/http://www.grovemusic.com/| archivedate=May 16, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain genres tend to emphasize the off-beat, where this is a defining characteristic of rock'n'roll and [[Ska]] music.

Slap bass executions on the backbeat are found in styles of country western music of the 1930s, and the late '40s early '50s music of Hank Williams reflected a return to strong backbeat accentuation as part of the honky tonk style of country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|type=Ph.D. |first=Gary Neville |last=Tamlyn |title=The Big Beat: Origins and Development of Snare Backbeat and other Accompanimental Rhythms in Rock'n'Roll |publisher=??? |year=1998 |pages=342–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the mid-1940s "[[country music|hillbilly]]" musicians the [[Delmore Brothers]] were turning out boogie tunes with a hard driving back beat, such as the No. 2 hit "Freight Train Boogie" in 1946, as well as in other boogie songs they recorded.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Similarly [[Fred Maddox]]'s characteristic backbeat, a [[slapping bass]] style, helped drive a rhythm that came to be known as [[rockabilly (rhythm)|rockabilly]], one of the early forms of [[rock and roll]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.honkytonks.org/showpages/maddox.htm Riding the Rails to Stardom - The Maddox Brothers and Rose]", ''NPR News''.

In today's popular music the [[snare drum]] is typically used to play the backbeat pattern.&lt;ref name="Schroedl" /&gt; Early [[funk music]] often delayed one of the backbeats so as "to give a 'kick' to the [overall] beat".&lt;ref name="Mattingly"&gt;Mattingly, Rick (2006).

'''Betty Lou Bredemus''' (August 13, 1934 – February 19, 2015) was an American actress and acting coach. The matriarch of the Roberts family, which includes [[Academy Award]]-winning actress [[Julia Roberts]],  [[Academy Award]]- nominee actor [[Eric Roberts]], and granddaughter [[Emma Roberts]], she also served in the [[United States Air Force]] and received a [[National Defense Service Medal]] for her service, which was spent entertaining the troops in Air Force base theatrical productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Liz |last=McNeil |title=Julia Roberts's Mother, Betty Lou Bredemus, Has Died |url=http://www.people.com/article/julia-roberts-mom-died-betty-lou-bredemus |accessdate=February 22, 2015 |work=People.com |date=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
{{one source|section|date=February 2018}}
Betty Lou Bredemus was born in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota, the daughter of Wendell John Bredemus (1904-1955), a football player, and Elizabeth Ellen ([[née]] Billingsley).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:V4HN-JCN|title=Wendell John Bredemus|work=Minnesota, Death Index|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|accessdate=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surname "Bredemus" or "Bredimus" is a typical [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg|Luxembourgish]] name, originating from places like Waldbredimus or Stadbredimus, near the Moselle-river. Betty Lou had one brother, Jim. She graduated from [[Austin High School (Minnesota)|Austin High School]] in 1952. In school she sang in the choir, and performed in the drama club ''Dirk &amp; Bobble'', appearing in productions like ''[[You Can't Take It with You (play)|You Can't Take It with You]]''.

The summer after graduation, Bredemus joined a stock company and performed in several plays, and then returned to Austin, where she studied dramatic arts at the local junior college. She was forced to leave school after her father became ill. Her brother had his education paid for by joining the Navy, which gave Bredemus the idea to join the United States Air Force. She signed up for two years, and started basic training in Texas in 1953. She spent her service at [[Keesler Air Force Base|Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi]].

==Career==
{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}
Bredemus met her husband Walter Grady Roberts (1933-1977) while performing in the play ''[[George Washington Slept Here]]'' together, which was directed by [[Rance Howard]], father of director [[Ron Howard]]. Howard and his wife [[Jean Speegle Howard|Jean]], Roberts and Bredemus became close friends, and decided to tour to a couple of USO bases performing plays. Bredemus and Roberts were married in 1955, and soon after their first child was born, actor [[Eric Roberts]] in April 1956.

After the army, Walter decided to pursue a career as a playwright, so he moved the family to Louisiana so he could attend [[Tulane University]]. The family lived on campus in family housing. Walter left school just shy of graduating, and he moved the family to [[Decatur, Georgia]] in 1960. Bredemus soon began working at [[Emory University]] in the public relations area, while Walter worked in various theatrical jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Julia Roberts booking|url=http://www.entertainmentbookingagency.com/artists/julia-roberts|accessdate=February 22, 2015|work=Entertainmentbookingagency.com|publisher=Entertainment Book Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Bredemus and Roberts created a children's show for the local network titled ''Bum Bum and His Buddies''. In the first episode, Bredemus played the role of Bum Bum the clown. Betty and Walter had previously created a short-lived series titled ''Creole Capers''. After 15 episodes of ''Buddies'', Bredemus and Roberts moved on to create the Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop, teaching classes to youth ages five to eighteen.&lt;ref name=wYmRoberts &gt;{{cite web| title = Julia Roberts Biography&amp;nbsp;— Yahoo!

The workshop became a huge success and popular among the children of Atlanta.

Among the children that enrolled were the children of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and his wife, [[Coretta Scott King|Coretta]]. Their eldest daughter [[Yolanda King]] took acting classes taught by Walter. In 1967, their daughter [[Julia Roberts]] was born. Bredemus' pregnancy caused commotion within the workshop community as she temporarily had to stop performing the various tasks needed to put on a show. When Julia was born Betty and Walter were experiencing financial difficulty, and Coretta Scott King offered to pay the hospital bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James|last=Spada|title=Julia: Her Life|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007|ISBN=9781429980975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King children were taking classes at the workshop when their father was assassinated.

The workshop eventually closed, and Roberts and Bredemus divorced in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;"Julia: Her Life", James Spada. St Martin's Press, New York.

'''''Bring It On''''' is a 2000 American [[Teen film|teen]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Peyton Reed]] and written by [[Jessica Bendinger]]. The film stars [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Eliza Dushku]], [[Jesse Bradford]], and [[Gabrielle Union]]. It was the first of the ''[[Bring It On (film series)|Bring It On]]'' film series and was followed by five [[direct-to-video]] sequels, none of which contain any of the original cast members: ''[[Bring It On Again]]'' (2004), which shared producers with the original, ''[[Bring It On: All or Nothing]]'' (2006), ''[[Bring It On: In It to Win It]]'' (2007), ''[[Bring It On: Fight to the Finish]]'' (2009) and ''[[Bring It On: Worldwide Cheersmack]]'' (2017). The plot of the film centers around a team's preparation for and participation in cheerleading competitions.

''Bring It On'' was released in theaters in the North America on August 25, 2000. ''Bring It On'' earned a worldwide gross of approximately $90 million. Since its release, the film has become a [[Cult film|cult classic]].&lt;ref name="IFC"/&gt;

==Plot==
Torrance Shipman, an 11th grade student at Rancho Carne High School in [[San Diego]], anxiously dreams about her first day of senior year. Her boyfriend, Aaron has gone to college, and her [[cheerleading]] squad, the Toros, is aiming for a sixth consecutive national title. Torrance is elected to replace the team captain, "Big Red" who is graduating. Soon, however, teammate Carver is injured and can no longer compete with her broken leg. Torrance holds an audition for Carver's replacement and gains Missy Pantone, a gymnast who recently transferred from Los Angeles to the school for senior year with her twin brother Cliff, with whom Torrance develops a flirtatious friendship. While watching the Toros practice, Missy recognizes their routines from a rival squad that her previous high school used to compete against. After accusing Torrance of being a liar and stealing the routine, she learns from Torrance's offended and passionately defensive reaction that she was completely unaware.  So Missy drives Torrance to her hometown of [[Los Angeles]], where they watch an [[African American]] and  Latino/Hispanic team, the [[East Compton, California|East Compton]] Clovers, perform routines that are virtually identical to their own team's. Isis, the Clovers' team captain, angrily confronts the two. Torrance learns that "Big Red" regularly attended the Clovers' practices to videotape and steal their routines. In the meantime, Missy is seen as a threat by the other female members of the squad (because of her outstanding gymnastic abilities), but she ends up becoming Torrance's best friend and de facto co-captain.

Isis informs Torrance of her plans to defeat the Toros at the regional and national championships, which the team has never attended due to their economic hardship. When Torrance tells the Toros about the routines, the team still votes in favor of using the current routine to win; Torrance reluctantly agrees. At the Toros' next home game, Isis and her teammates show up and perform the Toros' routine in front of the whole school, humiliating them. The Toros realize that they have no choice but to learn a different routine. In desperation, they employ a professional choreographer named Sparky Polastri to provide one, as suggested by Aaron. But at the Regionals, the team scheduled immediately ahead of the Toros performs the exact routine they had been practicing. The Toros have no choice but to perform the very same routine. After the debacle that ensues, Torrance speaks to a competition official and is told Polastri provided the routine to several other teams in California. As the defending champions, the Toros are nevertheless granted their place in Nationals, but Torrance is warned that a new routine will be expected. Torrance, crushed by her failure to lead the team successfully, considers quitting.

Cliff encourages and supports her, intensifying their growing attraction. Aaron, however, suggests that she is not leadership material and recommends that she step down from her position, [[selling out|selling her out]] in the process to Courtney and Whitney who have set themselves up as Torrance's rivals. When Cliff sees Torrance and Aaron together, he angrily severs his friendship with Torrance, to her distress. But her confidence is renewed by Cliff's encouragement and she convinces her unhappy team to create an innovative, new routine instead. She breaks up with Aaron, realizing his infidelity and his inability to be supportive, but Cliff still refuses to forgive her. Meanwhile, the Clovers are initially unable to compete at Nationals due to financial problems. This prompts Torrance to get her dad's company to sponsor the Clovers, but Isis rejects the money and gets her team to Nationals by appealing to a talk show host who grew up in their area. In the finals, the Toros place second, while the Clovers win. However, at the end of the movie, Torrance and Isis find respect in each other. Cliff and Torrance share a romantic kiss.

Bloopers run alongside the end credits, as the characters dance and lip-sync to [[B*Witched]]'s cover of "[[Mickey (song)|Mickey]]".

==Production==
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}
''Bring It On'' was produced by [[Marc Abraham]] and [[Thomas Bliss]]. It was the debut film of director [[Peyton Reed]]. His major concern with the film was pushing the sexual aspects of cheerleading without losing a [[PG-13]] rating.&lt;ref name="IFC"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rizov |first=Vadim |date=July 15, 2010 |title=The unexpected cult status of Peyton Reed’s "Bring It On." |url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2010/07/bring-it-on |publisher=[[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]] |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] from the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' argued that this agenda followed a trend of films at the time that watered down material in order to avoid an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]] and increase box office gross.&lt;ref name="CST2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=August 25, 2000 |title=Bring It On |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000825/REVIEWS/8250301 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to auditioning for the film, actors were expected to have a cheer prepared.&lt;ref name="DVDTalk"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kleinman |first=Geoffrey |title=Peyton Reed - Director of Bring it On |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/interviews/peyton_reed_dir.html |publisher=[[DVD Talk]] |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid the use of [[stunt double]]s, Reed required all the actors to undergo a four-week cheerleading camp.&lt;ref name="DVDTalk"/&gt; Reed and [[Gabrielle Union]] met numerous times to discuss the best way to approach her character.&lt;ref name="DVDTalk"/&gt; "I think she was able to find what was cool about that character that in a way I doubt other actresses could have," Reed explained in an interview, "Whenever she's on the screen she has this charisma."&lt;ref name="DVDTalk"/&gt; When editing the film, Reed and editor Larry Bock watched cheerleading exploitation films from the 1970s.&lt;ref name="IFC"/&gt;

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Bring It On'' was released in North America on August 25, 2000. The film grossed $17,362,105 in 2,380 theaters during its opening weekend, ranking first at the North American box office.&lt;ref name="BOM2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bring It On: 2000 |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=bringiton.htm |work=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it experienced an 18% decline in gross earnings, the film held the top position for a second consecutive week, and later on a third.&lt;ref name="BOM2"/&gt; The film went on to gross $68,379,000 in North America and an additional $22,070,929 overseas for a total gross of $90,449,929.&lt;ref name="BOM1"/&gt;

===Critical response===
[[File:Kirsten Dunst Cannes 2016.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Many critics felt the film displays Dunst's range as an actor.]]

The film received a 63% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on a total of 117 compiled reviews; the site's consensus reads: "Despite the formulaic, fluffy storyline, this movie is surprisingly fun to watch, mostly due to its high energy and how it humorously spoofs cheerleading instead of taking itself too seriously."&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|bring_it_on|Bring It On}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gave the film an average score of 52 based on 31 reviews, indicating "Mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bring It On |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bring-it-on |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. O. Scott]] from ''[[The New York Times]]'' commended the film for being able to "gesture toward serious matters of race and economic inequality", as well as for its "occasional snarl of genuine satire".&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Scott |first=A. O. |date=August 25, 2000 |title=Bring It On (2000) Film Review; Strong, Modest and Sincere Behind All the Giddy Cheer |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=980DE2D81431F936A1575BC0A9669C8B63&amp;partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Thomas of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' also favored the film, calling it a "Smart and sassy high school movie that's fun for all ages."&lt;ref name="Metacritic"/&gt; Steven Rae from ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' found it to be a "likable, low-budget high school comedy".&lt;ref name="Metacritic"/&gt; Meanwhile, Kim Morgan of ''[[The Oregonian]]'' dubbed it the "newest, and probably first, true cheerleading movie."&lt;ref name="Metacritic"/&gt;

However, some reviewers criticized the plot of the film. Although David Sterritt of ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' gave praise for the writing, he likened the storyline's simplicity to that of "the average football cheer".&lt;ref name="Metacritic"/&gt; Kim Edwards from the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', in a negative review, found the film "Absurdly unrealistic at times."&lt;ref name="Metacritic"/&gt; The ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''{{'}}s Paula Nechak concluded that the film was "predictable and surprisingly confusing in its ultimate message. "&lt;ref name="Metacritic"/&gt;

Many critics reserved praise for Kirsten Dunst's performance. In his review, A. O. Scott called her "a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; Charles Taylor of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' noted that "among contemporary teenage actresses, Dunst has become the sunniest imaginable parodist."&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Charles |date=August 25, 2000 |title="Bring It On": Two, four, six, eight, who do we appreciate? Spunky cheerleaders rip up the color line. |url=http://www.salon.com/2000/08/25/bring_it_on/ |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jessica Winter from ''[[The Village Voice]]'' shared this sentiment, commenting that "[Dunst] provides the only major element of ''Bring It On'' that plays as tweaking parody rather than slick, strident, body-slam churlishness."&lt;ref name="VV"&gt;{{cite web |last=Winter |first=Jessica |date=August 29, 2000 |title=Cheer and Loathing |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2000-08-29/film/cheer-and-loathing/1/ |work=[[The Village Voice]] |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Stack of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', despite giving the film an unfavorable review, commended Dunst for her willingness "to be as silly and cloyingly agreeable as it takes to get through a slapdash film."&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stack |first=Peter |date=August 25, 2000 |title=Navel Maneuvers / Cheerleader comedy `Bring It On' shows its stomachs, not its brains |url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Navel-Maneuvers-Cheerleader-comedy-Bring-It-3238944.php |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural historian [[Maud Lavin]] says that despite ''Bring It On''{{'}}s predictable plot, its depiction of aggressive and competitive women, the differences shown between class and race, and the playful way it deals with homophobia gives it deeper cultural clout and meaning. In particular, Lavin says that the film suggests race relations could be "smoothed and transcended through level-playing-field sports competitiveness."&lt;ref&gt;Lavin, Maud (2010). "Push Comes to Shove: New Images of Aggressive Women", p. 58. The MIT Press, Cambridge. {{ISBN|978-0-262-12309-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
The film ranked #30 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s list of the 50 Best High School Movies.&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20215654,00.html#1185785 |title=50 Best High School Movies | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=July 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially unimpressed with the film and giving it 2 of 4 stars, [[Roger Ebert]] later referred to it as the "''[[Citizen Kane]]'' of cheerleader movies."&lt;ref name="SunTimes2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=February 18, 2009 |title=Fired Up |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090218/REVIEWS/902189993 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Several of cast members from the ''Bring It On'' film franchise have gone on to greater fame or notoriety. [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Eliza Dushku]], [[Gabrielle Union]], [[Jesse Bradford]], [[Clare Kramer]], [[Lindsay Sloane]], and several others from the original film were already notable entertainers and television actors or have grown into such roles since their participation in the original film. [[Ryan Drummond]] voiced [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] from 1999 through 2004. [[Felicia Day]], who appeared in ''Bring It On Again'', became a highly respected actress in [[Joss Whedon]]'s projects such as ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'' and ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog]]'', as well as a screenwriter (''[[The Guild (web series)|The Guild]]''), entrepreneur and web content creator. [[Bree Turner]], who starred in ''Bring It On Again'', would go on to star in NBC's ''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]''. [[Joshua Gomez]], also from ''Bring It On Again'', was going to be well known as ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'' regular [[Morgan Grimes]]. [[Bethany Joy Lenz]] and [[Hayden Panettiere]], who appeared in ''Bring It On Again'' and ''Bring It On: All or Nothing'', went on to find sizable television audiences due to their roles on the television programs ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]''/''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]'', respectively. Lenz also appeared with [[Michael Copon]] (who co-starred in ''Bring It On: In It to Win It'') during ''One Tree Hill''{{'}}s second season. Copon also starred in ''[[Power Rangers Time Force]]'', [[Ashley Benson]] from ''In It to Win It'', became known as [[Hanna Marin]] in the [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] television series ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'' and [[Cassandra Scerbo]] from ''In It to Win It'', who later known as Nova Clarke in [[Syfy]]'s [[Sharknado (film series)|''Sharknado'' film series]]. The R&amp;B/Pop trio [[Blaque]] have a recurring role in ''Bring It On''. Noteworthy R&amp;B singer and film actress [[Christina Milian]], also appears as the main character in ''Bring It On: Fight to the Finish''. Brittany Anne Pirtle from ''Fight to the Finish'', went on to star as the Yellow Power Ranger in [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[Power Rangers Samurai]]'' and [[Holland Roden]] from ''Fight to the Finish'', became known as Lydia Martin in the [[MTV]] supernatural-drama ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]''. Finally, [[Cristine Prosperi]] from ''Bring It On: Worldwide Cheersmack'', who star as Imogen Moreno in ''[[Degrassi: The Next Generation]]''.

===Sequels===
''Bring It On'' has so far spawned a total of five [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]]s:
* ''[[Bring It On Again]]'' (2004)
* ''[[Bring It On: All or Nothing]]'' (2006)
* ''[[Bring It On: In It to Win It]]'' (2007)
* ''[[Bring It On: Fight to the Finish]]'' (2009)
* ''[[Bring It On: Worldwide Cheersmack]]'' (2017)

The only sequel to feature any of the original crew from ''Bring It On'' was 2004's ''[[Bring It On Again]]'', which shared the film's same producers. These producers did not return for the subsequent sequels, and none of the films share recurring cast members. Original star [[Eliza Dushku]] has even been quoted in interviews as never even having been invited to participate in the sequels. [[Steve Rash]] directed two of the sequels and Alyson Fouse has written four. Otherwise, none of the films in the ''Bring It On'' franchise share any personnel whatsoever.

The five films that follow ''Bring It On'' share only tenuous links with one another. The plot of each film typically follows that of the one originally laid out in the first film - a competitive cheerleading team who has to change routines or other elements they have grown accustomed to in order to win.

===Stage musical===

The ''New York Times'' reviewer wrote of the Ahmanson Theatre production: "After an opening number that truly dazzles as it reveals the cast’s impressive gymnastic prowess, the score hits its stride only when Campbell transfers to Jackson High. Driven by surging R&amp;B grooves and churning lyrics that suggest the fingerprints of Mr. Miranda ... the dance numbers for the Jackson crowd kick the musical into high gear for most of the first act.... Like most entertainments about the trials and triumphs of the teenage years, 'Bring It On' has as much sap as it does pep in its DNA. It’s distinguished primarily by the electrifying dance routines and the elaborate cheer-squad performances."&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

'''''Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller''''' is a 4-part [[episodic video game|episodic]] [[point-and-click]] [[graphic adventure game]] released by [[Phoenix Online Studios]] for multiple platforms.  Funded through [[Kickstarter]] in 2011, four episodes were released on the [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Macintosh|Mac]], with the first two on the [[iPad]].  [[Jane Jensen]], creator of the [[Sierra On-Line]] [[Gabriel Knight]] series, was a story consultant for the development of the game.

The first episode, ''The Hangman'', was released on October 30, 2012 and the final episode, ''The Cain Killer'', was released on September 19, 2013.

==Plot==
The story of ''Cognition'' revolves around Boston FBI agent Erica Reed, who has the unusual ability of [[postcognition]], the ability to see into the past of any object that she touches.  At first this power can’t be controlled, but, after training with an antique shop owner named Rose, Erica is not only able to control her power, but use it in different ways.  From seeing brief glimpses of the past on an object to helping someone regain lost memories to combining objects to see a vision of a scene where they were together, each ability is useful to help solve each murder mystery. The only person who knows her secret is her partner, John McCoy.

Each episode focuses on a different serial killer and covers a contained story arc while continuing the overarching story of the entire game: Erica's search for the Cain Killer, who murdered her brother Scott but was never caught. After losing her brother three years previous to the start of the game, Erica is determined to track down his killer to the point of obsession.  She gets taken off the case by her boss, and is moved onto others under their jurisdiction.  But as the game progresses, it becomes clear that these seemingly unrelated killings all have clues that only Erica can find, meaning that someone else knows her secret and wants something from her—someone who has a grudge with the FBI. As Erica gets closer to the truth, with people around her dying and being hurt, she also gets closer to her goal of finding the Cain Killer. But she must make her choice between justice and revenge when the moment comes.

==Episodes==
Each episode provides around 3–6 hours of gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tech-gaming.com/cognition-episode-4/ Cognition Episode 4: The Cain Killer Review] by Tech-Gaming&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Episode One: The Hangman'' (October 30, 2012) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postudios.com/blog/?p=2139 Episode 1 Release Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;===
It is three years after the death of Scott Reed, FBI agent Erica Reed's brother, and she is still on the case of his killer.  Unfortunately, the director of the Boston branch, Madison Davies, has closed the file on his murder, despite Erica's protest.  In the middle of the night, just as she was finishing up, her partner, John McCoy, tells her that the FBI has been called in to investigate the hanging of an unknown man.

Looking over the scene, taking evidence, and talking to other agents, Erica is able to deduce how the man died.  But not everything is as it seems.  Using her unstable cognitive powers, she manages to find a piece of a child's wooden toy.  Urged by her partner to seek out an antiques dealer by the name of Rose, Erica begins her journey to unlocking more mysteries of her latent abilities.  And finding out that the item is one part of a French toy called a Le Pendu, and that other parts are left behind by the killer as clues.

As she gathers these pieces to unlock another clue, a mysterious text is sent to her cell phone that brings to her attention an old case of a similar style.  Following this trail leads Erica to Robert Goodman, the husband of the previously hanged victim.  Trying to bring forth a long forgotten memory about the day she died, Erica learns her second power of regression.  After sorting out the memory fragments, she uncovers the name of the murderer: Antony Longmore.

Unfortunately, it is found out that the body discovered WAS Longmore.  Erica soon discovers that the next victim is her boss, Davies.  After an intense shootout in a church, Davies ends up dead, her neck snapped by a noose.  Erica is left wondering why she was targeted and by whom.

===''Episode Two: The Wise Monkey'' (January 30, 2013)  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postudios.com/blog/?p=2313 Episode 2 Release Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;===
Right after Davies’ tragic death, Erica and other agents involved are brought in to be debriefed by the new director of the Boston branch, Samuel McAdams.  McAdams was the Director there years ago, and is returning now to act as the interim director. During her grilling, both Erica and McAdams hear a noise coming from the main office and go out to investigate.  Jared “Sully” Sullivan, a fellow agent with whom Erica has an on-again/off-again relationship, is seen dragged off by the new office assistant, who leaves behind Sully's ear and a silver musical charm.

The current case being handled by Sully, "The Wise Monkey", is now tossed into Erica's lap.  The serial killer is named such due to her MO of cutting out the eyes, ears, and tongues of her victims.  She also leaves small musical charms on their bodies.  The lead suspect is a student at the Berklee College of Music, Kelsey Gardner, and the investigation revolves around trying to learn her whereabouts and what motive she could possibly have for killing the victims.

Erica goes to see the dean of the college, Kelsey's apartment, Kelsey's former roommate, and her boyfriend's (Joey Goethals) place of work and residence.  During her investigation, Erica discovers that the dean is secretly using loan money to fund extravagant purchases and that Kelsey confronted him about it whereupon her life was turned upside down because of his embezzlement.

Through the use of another ability gained thanks to Rose's help, called “synergy”, Erica is able to use the six charms that she has collected up to this point together to get a vision of the same alley where “The Hangman” was killed.  Seeing the past brought on by these charms, she realizes that Joey is the killer, not Kelsey.  Kelsey was in fact, Joey's first victim and he was cutting out his other victims' sense organs to make her perfect again, after feeling remorse over killing her.  However, we also find out that he became a victim of his own modus operandi.

The final confrontation takes place at Joey's hideout, where Erica has to figure out the way to rescue Sully who's trapped and next in line to be killed.  Thankfully, she manages to get inside quickly enough to save him.  The end of the episode shows Joey being tossed off a balcony of the Enthon Towers apartments.

===''Episode Three: The Oracle'' (May 16, 2013) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postudios.com/blog/?p=2946 Episode 3 Release Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;===
Throughout the first two episodes, Erica is introduced to Cordelia Smith.  She also lost a brother six years ago and is first seen confronting Erica about stealing a rose for Scott's grave at the cemetery.  Getting over this quickly, they hit it off from the start and talk about their brothers.  It is also discovered that Cordelia lives at the Enthon Towers and that she was afraid that someone was out to get her.  Through subterfuge, Erica manages to send a police car to keep tabs on the place.

The entirety of ''The Oracle'' takes place at the Towers and the player is constantly shifting between Cordelia's past and Erica's present.  It is revealed very early on in the episode that Cordelia is also a [[Psionics|psion]], with the power of [[precognition]] (she can see the future).  It is also revealed that she is the one that killed off Longmore, Davies, Goethals, and kidnapped Sully.

Erica tries to enter the Towers, but is blocked from doing so by McAdams and an elderly man by the name of Skorobeus.  Managing to sneak in, she goes looking for McCoy who went investigating the death of Joey Goethals.  From this point forward the episode has many flashbacks of what happened six years ago to the Smith family.  For they owned the Towers and this tells the tale of how Max Smith died at the hands of Cordelia.

In her visions of the future, Cordelia saw herself shooting and killing her brother.  She goes to the FBI and begs John McCoy to help because the agents investigating Max, Davies and McAdams, don’t believe her.  Through a series of four flashbacks where the player controls Cordelia and investigates the penthouse in the present as Erica, we discover that Skorobeus and Max are involved in some financial disputes. It is eventually revealed that Cordelia's other brother, Keith, is in fact elder gentleman's son, though he does not know this.

Following a hidden pathway to a sub-basement level, Erica confronts John who admits to knowing everything that happened leading up to her brother's death at the hands of the killer and demands to know why he didn’t say anything.  Discovering Keith's heavily injured and bandaged body (from the confrontation three years ago during a struggle with Erica) chained up in the room, they find out that Cordelia had kept him down there to do her dirty work to get Erica involved. After releasing him, Erica finds out that Keith is the Cain Killer that Erica has been searching for the past three years (and three episodes).

The episode ends as Erica accidentally shoots John, caught in the fear that her vision of herself getting shot by an shadowy figure was coming true.

===''Episode Four: The Cain Killer'' (September 19, 2013) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postudios.com/blog/?p=3339 Episode 4 Release Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;===
The series finale starts off with a flashback set three years ago, prior to Scott's abduction and subsequent death.  On the trail of the Cain Killer, Erica and John have arrived at a warehouse and she is preparing to infiltrate a contact of Cain's to find out information on the serial killer's whereabouts.  Her cover is eventually blown and she discovers, much to her horror, that Scott has been taken by Cain and is waiting for her arrival to complete his macabre scene.  She rushes to the cemetery, and since what follows has already been dealt with at the beginning of the first episode, the scene fades to Scott's funeral.

Fade to Cordelia's point-of-view.  She tracks Keith to an old family lake house and tries to figure out how to confront him for she knows what he's done and will do.  Having already met his flaming fate at the hands of Erica, burn scars are all over him and he's in the bathroom trying to clean up.  Cordelia looks around and finds implements of his MO and grabs some powder to subdue him.  Knocking him out, she takes him away.

In the present day and we see Erica and Cordelia talking.  After a brief kiss, Cordelia tells Erica to ask Rose about Bao Thanh.  Arriving at the antique shop, Erica uses her regression ability to help solidify this memory and reveal that not only was Bao Thanh as psion but so is Rose—she can read minds.  That is why she was helping both Erica and Cordelia with their abilities.

Moving on, Erica returns to the FBI station and is pulled from duty by McAdams because of what she did to John at the end of the previous episode.  Furious, she nonetheless sneaks into the interrogation room and roughs up Skorobeus to find out that Keith used to work out of the Smith family lake house.  Rushing over there, she meets up with Cordelia and after a tense conversation the two agree to work together to take down Keith.

Discovering his room of horrors in the basement, the two use their combined abilities of being able to see the past and future to uncover his next target: Erica's father.  Before they can leave, McAdams shows up and takes Erica into custody while Cordelia gets away.  Whether she can convince the director to help her or not, they end up back at the cemetery where it all started and Erica has to work with Cordelia again to save her father.  In one final epic confrontation with the Cain Killer, Cordelia sacrifices her own life to take out Cain, and to save Erica from choosing revenge over justice as she once did. In the epilogue, it is revealed that Erica is leaving the FBI to look for and help other psions, and that John died after the shooting in Episode 3, though Erica appears to use her powers to talk to an image of him. She goes to see Sully in the hospital, bringing him the lunch he asked her out for back in the first episode.

==Development==
[[Phoenix Online Studios]] ran a [[Kickstarter]] campaign from October 29, 2011 through December 10, 2011 to fund for Cognition.  Their goal was $25,000 and they brought in $34,247&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postudios/cognition-an-erica-reed-thriller Cognition Kickstarter]&lt;/ref&gt;  by November 21.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postudios/cognition-an-erica-reed-thriller/posts/142715 Kickstarter Update #8]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the campaign, the team began developing the game, using the Unity engine.

[[Skype]] and [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] were used for inter-team communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postudios.com/blog/?p=1643 Developer Diary: Managing an Online Team on a Shoestring Budget]&lt;/ref&gt;  The script was written by Cesar Bittar, Katie Hallahan and Nick Bryan, and music composed by Austin Haynes.  [[Jane Jensen]] acted as a story consultant, to help streamline the story, with [[Robert Holmes (composer)|Robert Holmes]] composing a song for the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postudios.com/blog/?p=1750 Robert Holmes composes main song for Cognition]&lt;/ref&gt;  Raleigh Holmes was selected to voice Erica Reed and sing the song, “The Taking”, with the Scarlet Furies.

==Reception==
Overall, ''Cognition'' has been viewed positively, with praise given to the story, production values, audio and music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://expansivedlc.com/review-cognition-erica-reed-thriller/ Review: Cognition - An Erica Reed Thriller] by Expansive DLC&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon release, reviewers commented on graphical issues, such as clipping issues and erratic walking animations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alteredconfusion.com/reviews/2013/9/29/cognition-an-erica-reed-thriller-review.html Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller Review] by Altered Confusion&lt;/ref&gt; but these have since been patched.  Erica's use of [[cognitive]] powers as a gameplay mechanic was positively received by fans and reviewers.

Critical reception generally increased as the series continued, excepting the final episode which received mixed reviews.   During the online release party for the final episode, ''The Cain Killer'', Phoenix suggested that a second season is planned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kickstartadventure.com/home/cognition-episode-4-the-cain-killer-review/ Cognition Episode 4: The Cain Killer REVIEW] by KickstartVentures&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Confrontation''''' is a tactical role-playing game developed by [[Cyanide (company)|Cyanide]] and based on [[Rackham]]'s [[Confrontation (Rackham)|miniatures game]]. The game is set in the fantasy universe of [[Aarklash]], a continent riven by an unending war. The player follows a party of Akkylannian fighters in their quest to seek out and destroy the source of the latest threat posed by the Alchemists of Dirz. Their journey will take them through numerous settings with rich decors where they will encounter other races which populate the continent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Gameplay==
Confrontation aims to reproduce the tactical combat of [[heroic fantasy]] classics as [[Baldur's Gate]]. The party is made up of four characters, chosen by the player amongst 12 available classes. Various synergies are possible and any combination could work to succeed a mission. However, it is far more challenging with an unbalanced party.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Four of Aarklash's factions are found in the game. The Akkylannian people built an empire whose aims are both religious and military. The Syhar are depraved scientists, specialized in alchemy and ungodly experiments. Their origins lie within the Empire of Akkylannie, but their quest to create the perfect being led them to be condemned for heresy and they were forced to flee. Seeking an army to protect themselves, the Syhars mixed goblin blood with that of men and created the Orcs. The union of Yllia, the Moon goddess, with the leader of a great pack of wolves, lead to the birth of the Wolfen. They are the protectors of nature and are guided only by their predatory instincts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Reception ==

The game received "mixed" reviews, according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/confrontation&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3564">'''''Dancing for eels''''' was a dance competition activity that was practiced during the 19th century by African-Americans at the market in [[Catherine Street and Catherine Slip]] in [[New York City]]. The dancing steps and gestures used were characterized by relatively fixed [[choreography]]. This activity is depicted in a number of folk paintings, and is described in [[Thomas F. De Voe]]’s 1862 ''The Market Book''. It is also analyzed in the 1998 book ''Raising Cain: Blackface performance from Jim Crow to Hip Hop'' by [[W.T. Lhamon]], in connection with the development of [[blackface minstrelsy]] as well as [[African-American music]] and [[African-American dance]] performances.

According to Thomas de Voe’s description, dancing for eels was a popular practice at [[Catherine Market]], which in the 19th century was a destination place for African-American slaves from [[Long Island]] who would bring to the market berries, herbs, fish, clams and oysters in order to make a few [[shilling]]s. Originally those African-Americans would be hired by the market people to dance for money or for fish (hence dancing for eels).

The Catherine Market in the 19th century was a mixed meeting place for people of various backgrounds, and white working-class people were frequent spectators of the dancing contests. According to W. T. Lhamon, [[blackface]] performance was strongly influenced by Catherine Market dancing elements. Modern rap and hip-hop performance also contain traces of gestural continuity from the New York street dancers, which, for example, can be observed in [[MC Hammer]]’s using the Market Step in his video [[U Can't Touch This]]: a knees open, heel-to-toe rock, often accompanied by one or both hands overhead. This move traces back to ''Dancing for Eels 1820 Catherine Market'', one of the folk drawings depicting the old competition. This drawing is supposedly the source for a later painting, which dates to 1880-1890s. This painting is oil paint on canvas, laid over a tin backing.  The subject and composition has a long popularity in American culture.

According to an 1849 fishing manual, black men still would meet at the market at dawn to skin eels and engage in dance competition for bundles of fish. The audience would vote for the winner through making noises and cheering for their most favorited performance. This style of completion carried on throughout African American culture all the way to modern day freestyle rap competing. These forms of entertainment grew into routines that featured singing, dancing, and humor for more on stage acts performed by professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Freedom on My Mind|last = White|first = Deborah Gray|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-0-312-64883-1|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Editing''' is the process of selecting and preparing [[written language|written]], [[Image editing|visual]], [[Audio engineer|audible]], and [[Film editing|film]] media used to convey information. The editing process can involve correction, condensation, organization, and many other modifications performed with an intention of producing a correct, consistent, accurate and complete work.&lt;ref&gt;Mamishev, Alexander, Williams, Sean, ''Technical Writing for Teams: The STREAM Tools Handbook'', Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, John Wiley &amp; Sons. Inc., Hoboken, 2009, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The editing process often begins with the author's idea for the work itself, continuing as a collaboration between the author and the editor as the work is created. Editing can involve creative skills, human relations and a precise set of methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encarta Dictionary definition of "editing" |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/editing.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwbaCYwg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/editing.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encarta Dictionary definition of "editor" |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/editor.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwbaiWpi?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/editor.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Editorial office of Bild newspaper, West Berlin, 1977.jpg|thumb|right|Editors work on producing an issue of ''[[Bild]]'', [[West Berlin]], 1977. Previous front pages are affixed to the wall behind them.]]
There are various editorial positions in publishing. Typically, one finds editorial assistants reporting to the senior-level editorial staff and directors who report to senior executive editors. Senior executive editors are responsible for developing a product for its final release. The smaller the publication, the more these roles overlap.

The top editor at many publications may be known as the [[chief editor]], [[executive editor]], or simply the editor. A frequent and highly regarded contributor to a [[magazine]] may acquire the title of editor-at-large or [[contributing editor]]. Mid-level newspaper editors often manage or help to manage sections, such as business, sports and features. In U.S. newspapers, the level below the top editor is usually the [[managing editor]].

In the book [[publishing]] industry, editors may organize [[Anthology|anthologies]] and other compilations, produce definitive editions of a classic author's works (scholarly editor), and organize and manage contributions to a multi-author book (symposium editor or volume editor). Obtaining manuscripts or recruiting authors is the role of an ''acquisitions editor'' or a ''[[commissioning editor]]'' in a publishing house.&lt;ref name="PolandLouise"&gt;Poland, Louise, The business, Craft and Profession of the Book Editor, in Carter, David, Galligan, Anne, (eds.), ''Making books: contemporary Australian publishing'', Queensland University Press, 2007, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Finding marketable ideas and presenting them to appropriate authors are the responsibilities of a sponsoring editor.

[[copy editing|Copy editors]] correct [[spelling]], [[grammar]] and align writings to [[Style guide|house style]]. Changes to the [[publishing]] industry since the 1980s have resulted in nearly all copy editing of book manuscripts being outsourced to [[freelance]] copy editors.&lt;ref name="PolandLouise" /&gt;

At [[newspaper]]s and [[wire services]], copy editors write headlines and work on more substantive issues, such as ensuring accuracy, fairness, and taste. In some positions, they [[news design|design pages]] and select news stories for inclusion. At U.K. and Australian newspapers, the term is ''sub-editor''. They may choose the layout of the publication and communicate with the printer. These editors may have the title of ''[[News design|layout or design editor]]'' or (more so in the past) ''makeup editor''.
[[File:JACK BREIBART, 1994.jpg|thumb|right|Page 1 Editor Jack Breibart in the San Francisco Chronicle newsroom, 1994.]]
==Scholarly books and journals==
Within the publishing environment, editors of scholarly books are of three main types, each with particular responsibilities:

* ''Acquisitions editor'' (or ''commissioning editor'' in Britain), who contracts with the author to produce the copy
* ''Project editor'' or ''production editor'', who sees the copy through its stages from manuscript to bound book and usually assumes most of the budget and schedule responsibilities
* ''Copy editor'' or ''manuscript editor'', who prepares the copy for conversion into printed form.

In the case of multi-author [[edited volume]]s, before the manuscript is delivered to the publisher it has undergone substantive and linguistic editing by the volume's editor, who works independently of the publisher.

As for [[scholarly journal]]s, where spontaneous submissions are more common than commissioned works, the position of ''journal editor'' or [[editor-in-chief]] replaces the acquisitions editor of the book publishing environment, while the roles of production editor and copy editor remain. However, another editor is sometimes involved in the creation of scholarly research articles. Called the [[authors' editor]], this editor works with authors to get a manuscript fit for purpose before it is submitted to a scholarly journal for publication.

The primary difference between copy editing scholarly books and journals and other sorts of copy editing lies in applying the standards of the publisher to the copy. Most scholarly publishers have a preferred style that usually specifies a particular dictionary and style manual—for example, ''[[the Chicago Manual of Style]]'', the ''[[MLA Style Manual]]'' or the [[APA style|''APA Publication Manual'']] in the US, or the [[New Hart's Rules]] in the U.K.

==Technical editing==
{{see also|Technical writing|Technical communication}}
Technical editing involves reviewing text written on a technical topic, identifying usage errors and ensuring adherence to a style guide.

Technical editing may include the correction of grammatical mistakes, misspellings, mistyping, incorrect punctuation, inconsistencies in usage, poorly structured sentences, wrong scientific terms, wrong units and dimensions, inconsistency in significant figures, technical ambivalence, technical disambiguation, statements conflicting with general scientific knowledge, correction of synopsis, content, index, headings and subheadings, correcting data and chart presentation in a research paper or report, and correcting errors in citations.

Large companies dedicate experienced writers to the technical editing function. Organizations that cannot afford dedicated editors typically have experienced writers peer-edit text produced by less experienced colleagues.

It helps if the technical editor is familiar with the subject being edited. The "technical" knowledge that an editor gains over time while working on a particular product or technology does give the editor an edge over another who has just started editing content related to that product or technology. But essential general skills are attention to detail, the ability to sustain focus while working through lengthy pieces of text on complex topics, tact in dealing with writers, and excellent communication skills.

==Editing services==
{{Redirect|Paid editing|paid editing on Wikipedia|Paid editing on Wikipedia}}

Editing is a growing field of work in the [[service industry]]. '''Paid''' '''editing services''' may be provided by specialized editing firms or by self-employed ([[Freelancer|freelance]]) editors.

Editing firms may employ a team of in-house editors, rely on a network of individual contractors or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Appiah |first=Bernard |title=Science editing at an Indian firm: perspectives of two US visitors |journal=Science Editing |year=2009 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=118–119 |url=http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/files/scienceeditor/v32n4p118-119.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928030255/http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/files/scienceeditor/v32n4p118-119.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such firms are able to handle editing in a wide range of topics and genres, depending on the skills of individual editors. The services provided by these editors may be varied and can include [[proofreading]], [[copy editing]], [[online editing]], [[developmental editing]], editing for [[search engine optimization]] (SEO), etc.

Self-employed editors work directly for clients (e.g., authors, publishers) or offer their services through editing firms, or both. They may specialize in a type of editing (e.g., copy editing) and in a particular subject area. Those who work directly for authors and develop professional relationships with them are called [[author editing|authors' editors]].

'''''Enter Achilles''''' is a performance created by the theatre company [[DV8 Physical Theatre]] and directed by [[Lloyd Newson]]. First performed on 7 June 1995 at [[Vienna Festival|Vienna Festwochen]] in Vienna, [[Austria]], the piece initially toured around the UK and Europe in 1995, before moving to Australia in early 1996. The performance was later revived and toured in 1997, visiting Europe and North America, and again in 1998, where it toured Europe and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dv8.co.uk/projects/archive/enter-achilles/tour-dates--original-productions|title=ENTER ACHILLES|work=dv8.co.uk|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stage ==

The performance, with a run time of 75 minutes, explores masculinity and our perception of the stereotypical 'bloke'. Set in a dark, dusty, British pub, a group of men gather around the blasting jukebox, a pint in one hand and a cigarette in the other. Movement and dance based, this physical theatre performance uncovers the men's insecurities and vulnerability.  The concept of gender is investigated through the understanding of what we deem as 'unmanly' and this is closely represented through the gestures, action and movement of the performers, a technique which is often associated with the work of Lloyd Newson and DV8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dv8.co.uk/projects/archive/enter-achilles/original-text|title=ENTER ACHILLES|work=dv8.co.uk|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at conformity regarding male relationships, friendships and identity the performance attempts to realise the struggle of being a 'real' man. The piece is an exploration, concentrating on the complications of existence within a mans world. After receiving its world premiere in Vienna in 1995, the piece went on to tour extensively, and was critically acclaimed, with [[Rupert Christiansen]] in [[The Observer]] stating that it was 'heartening to find DV8 blazing a fresh, dangerous trail'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dv8.co.uk/pages/review-the-observer-straight-and-narrow-minded|title=Review: The Observer|work=dv8.co.uk|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film ==

in 1995, [[Lloyd Newson|Newson]] collaborated with the director Clara Van Gool to adapt the stage piece for film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109734/|title=Enter Achilles (1996)|author=pmshrink|date=20 July 2007|work=IMDb|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting piece, which was screened at numerous film festivals around the world, received numerous awards, including an [[25th International Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]] for the Performing Arts in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media-british-talent-scoops-four-emmy-awards-1296315.html|title=Media: British talent scoops four Emmy awards|work=The Independent|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Form 4 student Fung Sun-hei of a Band 3 secondary school is a well known typical neet who is bad-tempered and performs poorly in academics. One day, Sun-hei gets in trouble for causing major havoc in school. However, headmaster Lo {[[Lowell Lo]]) gives him a final chance to redeem himself by requesting him to participate in the "Find Your Voice Trial Program" (熱血合唱團試驗計劃), a project which involves forming a classical music chorus composed of three Band 3 students who go in to nine months of special training to compete in the Intercollegiate Chorus Competition (校際合唱團比賽) afterwards. Without a choice, Sun-hei reluctantly accepts the offer. The outside world views this project as one that is more difficult than reaching to the skies and teases them as the "Rotten Orange Chorus" (爛橙合唱團). However, unexpectedly, renowned Hong Kong-American conductor Yim Chi-long ([[Andy Lau]]), dubbed the "Iron-Blooded Instructor" of the music industry, who have been living seclusion for a year, returns to Hong Kong to be the conductor of the chorus.

A '''fire umbrella''' is a [[fire dancing]] tool. It is made from an [[umbrella]] with the rainproof cover removed. [[Kevlar]] wicks are attached to the ends of the umbrella, soaked in a fuel, and then lit on fire. The dancer can manipulate the fire umbrella around her or his body, usually twirling it to give the illusion of a spinning ring of fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|WPQ5FDO-Sxs|Example of a fire umbrella dance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married her second husband, Morton Wormser, during the same decade.&lt;ref name=spt/&gt; They lived in [[Sarasota, Florida]], for over 25 years.&lt;ref name=spt/&gt; Morton Wormser was an avid [[tennis]] player and supporter of the sport.&lt;ref name=spt/&gt; As a result of this interest, professional tennis player [[Martina Navratilova]] lived with Frances and Morton when she first arrived in the [[United States]] in the early 1970s.

Frances and Morton Wormser traveled "around the world" on their honeymoon.&lt;ref name=spt/&gt; She took her last major trip to visit friends in [[Maui]] when she was 100 years old.&lt;ref name=spt/&gt; She was a major contributor to the [[Aviation Museum of Santa Paula]], which she supported in honor of her brother, pilot Jim Dewey.&lt;ref name=spt/&gt;

==Career==
Dewey spent more than a decade in [[showbusiness]] during the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name=var/&gt; She played the lead role in a number of shows, including the 1925 revival of ''Sally, Irene &amp; Mary''.&lt;ref name=var/&gt; It was her performance in ''[[The Girl Friend]]'' in 1926, which caught the attention of producer [[Lew Fields]].&lt;ref name=var/&gt; Fields created the ''Dewey and Gold Revue'', specifically for Dewey and her professional performing partner, Al Gold.&lt;ref name=var/&gt; Dewey and Gold toured together on the Pantages Circuit in 1927 and 1928.&lt;ref name=var/&gt; She toured in ''Good Boy'' in 1929.&lt;ref name=var/&gt;

Wormser also performed with [[Cary Grant]] in an out-of-town tryout of ''[[Boom Boom (theater)|Boom Boom]]'' in late 1928,&lt;ref name=spt/&gt; which was one of Grant's earliest roles.&lt;ref name=var/&gt; She later appeared in ''[[Shoot the Works]]'', a 1931&lt;ref name=spt/&gt; revue on Broadway by [[Heywood Broun]].&lt;ref name=var/&gt; Dewey was also featured in the very first franchised list of [[Leonard Sillman]]'s ''[[New Faces]]'' in 1934.&lt;ref name=var/&gt; Silman's ''New Faces'' introduced audiences to new up-and-coming Broadway actors, such as Wormser. The 1934 first edition of New Faces also included [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Imogene Coca]]. Coca became a lifelong friend of Frances Wormser,&lt;ref name=spt/&gt; who also counted [[Leo Lerman]], the former editor of [[Vogue Magazine]] and [[editor-in-chief]] of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', to be her professional "soul mate". He died in 1994.&lt;ref name=spt/&gt;

Dewey officially retired from the [[entertainment industry]] during the 1930s.&lt;ref name=var/&gt; She was a [[buyer]] for '''Jane Engel''', a women's clothing company, around this time.&lt;ref name=spt/&gt;

==Death==
Frances Dewey Wormser died on January 28, 2008, from natural causes in [[Santa Paula, California]]. She was 104 years old. She had no children.&lt;ref name=var/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5113">'''Gambling in Norway''' is illegal for the most part. [[Norsk Tipping]] and [[Norsk Rikstoto]] are the 2 only companies allowed to offer [[gambling]] services to Norwegian citizens. Norsk Tipping offers games like [[Lottery|lotteries]], [[sports betting]], [[Keno]] and several others.  Norsk Tipping is wholly state-owned company under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Culture and Church affairs,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.norsk-tipping.no/selskapet/english Norsk Tipping]&lt;/ref&gt; with rules about what times of day, and how much money players can bet.  As of January 2011 all players have to be over 18 years of age to play all games of Norsk Tipping, except scratch tickets. Norsk Rikstoto is also state-owned and is the only company authorised to arrange horse race betting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siscon.dk/pages/id98.asp Business Case: Norsk Rikstoto]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is legal to arrange gambling parties at home, as long as these parties are not organised as a business.  Except games offered by Norsk Tipping, all other forms of online gambling are illegal,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/02/24/norway_online_gambling/ The Register: Norway gov mulls blocking online gambling]&lt;/ref&gt; with the government working towards stopping foreign companies from operating in Norway.  In June 2010 the Norwegian Government passed a law that forced all banks in Norway to deny the customers the use of credit and debit cards at land and online casinos all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/8566-norway-puts-ban-on-online-gaming-payments Cardplayer.com: Norway Puts Ban on Online Gaming Payments]&lt;/ref&gt;

Norwegian citizens are also required to declare tax winnings made in another country.

==Lottery and gaming legislation==
Lotteries and games have always been strictly controlled by the Norwegian government. According to §§ 298 and 299 of the Norwegian Penal Code of 1902, only those games of chance that were offered by special license holders were legal. Only the authority of a legal statute could grant such permission. Thus, all other games, where the main factor affecting the win was luck, were prohibited. Unauthorized gaming operators were punished.

Three acts that were introduced later in the 20th century, offered some exceptions from the strict ban. These were the 1927 Totalisator Act, the 1992 Gaming Act, and the 1995 Lottery Act. In general, they established the state monopoly in the industry. The 1927 Act provided the basis for giving the Norsk Riksoto Foundation the right to offer horse-race betting services. The supervision of their activity was the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture.

The 1992 Gaming Act granted the state owned Norsk Tipping AS exclusive rights to operate the number game Lotto and football betting, with the Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs tasked to supervise them. The 1995 Lottery Act was more comprehensive as it defined and described all forms of lotteries and other games. It also allowed socially oriented organizations to run such games, because the money collected could be used for the benefit of society.&lt;ref name = "Defence"&gt;[http://www.regjeringen.no/upload/kilde/kkd/prm/2006/0063/ddd/pdfv/281968-forsvarsskrift-efta-casee-1-06-statement-of-defence-18may2006.pdf Statement of Defence by the Government of the Kingdom of Norway]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slots==
In the late 1990s, operation of slots fell under the regulation of the Lottery Act 1995. That was a piece of legislation prepared at the beginning of the last decade of the 20th century. While at the dawn of slot technology, that legislation was sufficient, but it didn't foresee significant technological advances and the subsequent social reaction.

In 2001 and 2004, the gross turnover from [[slot machine]]s was NOK 9 billion and NOK 26 billion. That was a tremendous growth comparing to the NOK 200 million in 1990, when slots accounted for a marginal part of the gross turnover of the gaming and lottery sector. In 2004, slot machines brought 64% of gross turnover and 43% of net turnover.

Being poorly regulated and possessing a serious market potential, slot machines industry grew very fast. The Lottery Act granted licenses only to charitable organizations, but it also didn't prohibit private companies to run slots on behalf of such organizations and share the profit.  
In 2002 the authorities started working towards restricting slots. One of the officially named reasons for limiting the number of slot machines and introducing various strict requirements was that the number of problem gamblers grew almost proportionally to the number of slot machines. The draft legislation was introduced in March 2003, but the interested commercial companies attempted to legally challenge the new rules.&lt;ref name ="Defence" /&gt;

Eventually, in July 2007, slot machines were banned in Norway. In 2009 IVTs (interactive video terminals) were introduced. The players required to have a special card to play on them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/2908376.html Don't Call this News]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Get 'Em''''' is an [[open world]] [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] released in the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] on June 14, 2016. It was developed and published by [[Behdad Sami Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.behdadsamiinteractive.com/|title=Behdad Sami Interactive Homepage|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game stars superhero crime fighting dogs, who are on a mission to track down the city's most ruthless gangster, save their dognapped friend, and make it onto the police K9 unit. Get 'Em is a full-fledged video game, made specifically for mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4wtau8qGFI/|title=Get 'Em Trailer|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==

Not only can you play as many different dogs, but you can customize each dogs outfit, and enhance their powers. Get 'Em features many different styles of gameplay from first person, guitarhero-style, third person, infinite runner, top-down, and open world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makemac.com/get-em-review/|title=MakeMac Article|accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appgefahren.de/get-em-neues-open-world-abenteuer-um-eine-horde-gesetzestreuer-hunde-172802.html/|title=Appgefahern Article|accessdate=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characters===
Get 'Em has eight main characters and three bonus characters to play as.

=== Bones ===
Bones are a currency obtained in-game during gameplay, watching advertisements, completing main and sub-missions, finding a free gift hidden throughout the city, and using legal currency to buy them in various amounts. Bones are counted in the top middle of the screen. Various amounts of bones can be used to buy new characters, new accessories, refill life and turbo meters, or to enhance each characters superpowers.

==Development==
While recovering from injuries occurred during his professional basketball career in the 2010/2011 season, [[Behdad Sami]] decided to pursue his dream of creating a video game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/the-strange-story-of-the-pro-basketball-player-who-broke-his-leg-and-made-a-video-game-thats-gta-with-dogs-925/|title=VICE Article|accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behdad Sami Interactive's first game, Get 'Em officially started production in 2011. It was planned to take a total of 6 months to produce, but due to numerous unfortunate setbacks, production took an extra 5 years. Get 'Em was finally released in summer of 2016 for the iOS platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/get-em/id961889853?mt=8/|title=Get 'Em iOS Link|accessdate=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fall of 2016 for Android.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.behdadsamiinteractive.getem&amp;hl=en/|title=Get 'Em Android Link|accessdate=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Get 'Em was inspired by the open world free-roaming games [[Grand Theft Auto]] and [[Need For Speed Underground]]. The name comes from the term most dog owners use to tell their dog to fetch or "get" something. The concept of the game was to bring crime-fighting dogs into the spotlight, instead of being in a sidekick role. Behdad wanted users to play as superhero vigilante dogs in an open world environment, to give the users a sense of freedom as a dog in a big city. The art style created by SuperGenius Studios was designed to look like a cel-shaded 3D cartoon or comic book playable video game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geek.com/games/a-pro-basketball-player-made-grand-theft-auto-for-dogs-1660166/|title=GEEK Article|accessdate=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graphic Novel==

On October 19, 2017, the first Get 'Em children's graphic novel, based on the Get 'Em video game, was released on iBooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/get-em/id1288837750|title=Graphic Novel Link|accessdate=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Howard "Sandman" Sims''' (January 24, 1917 – May 20, 2003) was an [[African-American]] [[tap dance]]r who began his career in [[vaudeville]]. He was skilled in a style of dancing that he performed in a wooden sandbox of his own construction, and acquired his nickname from the sand he sprinkled to alter and amplify the sound of his dance steps. "They called the board my [[Stradivarius]]," Sims said of his sandbox.&lt;ref name="LATimes86" /&gt;

From the 1950s to the year 2000, Sims was a regular attraction—a "fixture"&lt;ref name="NYTobit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v7UDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=%22sandman+sims%22|title=Tap Legend Howard 'Sandman' Sims Succumbs|work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|date=June 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;—at [[Harlem]]'s noted [[Apollo Theater]], comedically ushering failed acts offstage&lt;ref name="PI" /&gt; with a hook, broom or other prop.&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Showtime" /&gt; He was also involved in New York City's [[Hoofers Club]], a venue primarily for black tap dancers.

As part of the resurgence of interest in tap dancing in the 1980s, Sandman Sims served as a cultural ambassador, representing the United States with dance performances around the world. He was featured in the 1989 dance film ''[[Tap (film)|Tap]]'', along with [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Gregory Hines]] and [[Savion Glover]], demonstrating classic challenge dancing. Sims also appeared in a 1990 episode of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' as Rudy's tap dancing teacher, facing off against Cliff ([[Bill Cosby]]) in a good-natured tap challenge.

In her review of the play based on his life, ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Anna Kisselgoff]] wrote, "Sims is a virtuoso among virtuosos—in a class by himself. To say Mr. Sims dances on sand is like saying [[Philippe Petit]] is a tightrope walker."&lt;ref name="NYTplay"&gt;{{cite news|author=Kisselgoff, Anna|title=Dance: Play Based on Sandman Sims|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 2, 1986|page=C29|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/02/arts/dance-play-based-on-sandman-sims.html|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Born in [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]] on January 24, 1917,&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/may/31/local/me-sims31|title=Howard 'Sandman' Sims, 86; Tap Dancer Famed for His Percussive Range|author=Segal, Lewis|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 31, 2003|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Howard+%22Sandman%22+Sims.-a0111979441|title=Howard 'Sandman' Sims|author=Goldberg, Jane|work=[[Dance Magazine]]|page=232|date=December 1, 2003|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sims was one of 12&lt;ref name="arts.gov" /&gt; children. The family soon relocated to [[Los Angeles, California]], where he was raised. Describing his childhood, Sims said, "It was just a whole big dancing family."&lt;ref name="NYT77"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F02EFDA133EE334BC4153DFBF66838C669EDE|title=This Sandman Will Keep Them Awake|author=Dunning, Jennifer|work=The New York Times|date=September 9, 1977|page=50|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;!-- please do not add this template to the other NYT citations on this page, the 1977 articles are subscriber-only but the others are open-access --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He learned to dance from his father, and said he was dancing as soon as he could walk.&lt;ref name="JumpCut" /&gt; He began tap-dancing at the age of 3.&lt;ref name="Brief" /&gt; He attributed some of his early love for tap dancing in particular to his mother, exasperated that he kept wearing out the toes of his shoes, putting steel taps on the shoes.&lt;ref name="NYT77" /&gt; Along with his brothers, Sims was dancing on the sidewalks of Los Angeles from a young age.&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt; At the age of 14, peeping in the windows of a dance school got Sims arrested for loitering, but he was able to dance his way to freedom, convincing a judge that his reason for being on that street was legitimate.&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-03-29/entertainment/8903300775_1_sandman-sims-national-tap-dance-day-four-step-brothers|title=Tapping Into A Trend|author=Campbell, Mary|date=March 29, 1989|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|agency=Associated Press|quote=I got put in jail," Sims said. "I had to go to court to get loose. This is a true story. I told the judge I wasn't loitering. I like to see how they dance because I try to be a [[buck dance]]r. He told them to clear the chairs and desks away and to let him see what I did. I danced a little bit and he said, 'Case dismissed!'|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man, despite his dance talent, Sims aspired to be not a professional dancer, but a professional [[boxing|boxer]].&lt;ref name="Dance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arts.gov" /&gt; After twice breaking his hand, he decided he needed a different means of making a living.&lt;ref name="LATimes86"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-07-04/entertainment/ca-690_1_rhythm-essence-taps|title=Best Feet Forward In 'Essence Of Rhythm'|author=Pasles, Chris|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 4, 1986|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt; Sims had noticed that boxing audiences reacted positively to the way he would dance in the [[rosin]] box before getting into the ring,&lt;ref name="LATimes86" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT77" /&gt; and especially to the distinctive sound his dancing made moving the rosin granules around the wooden box. He began to consider dancing as a career alternative.&lt;ref name="NYTobit" /&gt; Sims experimented with several different methods of reproducing the rosin box effect, gluing sandpaper to either his shoes or his dancing mat, but the sandpaper created too much wear on the other surface.&lt;ref name="NYTobit" /&gt; Finally he found the solution: loose sand in a low-lipped box.&lt;ref name="NYTobit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brief" /&gt; "People went for the scraping sound ... So I made a sound board by sprinkling sand on a flat platform. That was in 1935."&lt;ref name="LATimes86" /&gt; His sandbox remained his trademark throughout his career, with some venues even telling Sims, "If you don't bring your sandbox, don't come at all."&lt;ref name="JumpCut"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC26folder/NoMapsonTaps.html |title=''No Maps on My Taps:'' Forgotten dancers|author=Biederman, Marcia|journal=Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media|volume=no. 26|pages=3–4|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, it was common for dancers to carry tap shoes with them and, when they encountered another dancer on the street, throw down their shoes by way of challenge.&lt;ref name="NYTobit" /&gt; The culture of street dancing in the 1920s has been compared to the rise of [[break dancing]] six decades later.&lt;ref name="NYTobit" /&gt; As the journal ''[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]]'' described it, "'challenge dancing,' in which each performer tries to outdo the other, is part of tap dancing's heritage, something like the [[jazz]] solos in which musicians try to outshine one another."&lt;ref name="JumpCut" /&gt; Sims later described how the atmosphere of these dance challenges was at least as much collegial as combative, and how dancers learned from one another in what became essentially "open air dance schools".&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rethinking Dance History: A Reader|author=Carter, Alexandra|publisher=Routledge|page=133|year=2004|isbn=978-0-415-28747-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYaMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite performing at various [[vaudeville]] venues,&lt;ref name="NYT81" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakamura" /&gt; Sims found neither fame nor success as a dancer in Los Angeles. In 1947, he tagged along on one of his professional-boxer friend [[Archie Moore]]'s cross-country drives, and settled in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="NYTobit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt;

== Harlem ==
After arriving in [[Harlem]], Sims began performing on the street as he had done in California, but faced stiff competition from other innovative dancers: "I knew people who danced on dinner plates. ... There was a man who could dance on newspapers without tearing them. And another who constructed a gigantic xylophone to tap on."&lt;ref name="arts.gov" /&gt; He performed on corners in between working whatever jobs he could find,&lt;ref name="arts.gov" /&gt; and then discovered the "[[amateur night|Amateur Night]]" stage on Wednesdays at the [[Apollo Theater]], where he soon gained local notoriety. He eventually won the Amateur Night competition a record-breaking 25 times, after which a rule was instituted that performers could no longer compete once they had earned four first prizes.&lt;ref name="PI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When big name dancers played The Apollo, there was nothing in the audience but dancers with their shoes," said Sandman Sims. "Up in the balcony dancers, and the first six rows, you saw nothing but tap-dancers, want-to-be tap-dancers, gonna-be tap-dancers, tried-to-be tap-dancers. That's the reason a guy would want to dance at The Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWJXUnPDFk0C&amp;pg=PA99|title=Steppin' on the Blues: The Visible Rhythms of African American Dance|author=Malone, Jacqui|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1996|page=99|isbn=978-0-252-06508-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Having found work dancing did not stop him from dancing on the street, however. "If I saw a dancer, I'd challenge him. I didn't care who it was. The way to get known in New York was to be the best. That's what I strived to be."&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribune" /&gt; Part of the culture of street challenges, as in Los Angeles, was that competing dancers would also learn from one another.

A significant change to Sims's dancing style came about as a result of his interaction with Harlem's [[hoofer]]s, practitioners of a variation on the tap he had learned on the west coast.&lt;ref name="NYTobit" /&gt; Sims would later define the main difference between tap and hoofing as being that tap focuses on the heel and toe whereas hoofers "use the whole foot".&lt;ref name="Tribune" /&gt;&lt;ref name="US1" /&gt; As a result of the synergy between hoofing technique and his unique use of a sandbox, his routines were described as being "as rich in sounds and textures as they were in steps."&lt;ref name="NYT86" /&gt; Sims himself put it, "The feet are a set of drums."&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt;

Constance Valis Hill, in her 2009 survey ''Tap Dancing America: A Cultural History'', described the hoofers' mecca thusly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the Hoofers Club, rookie and veteran, mostly [B]lack male tap dancers assembled to share with, steal from, and challenge each other; there, new standards were set for competition. These were nothing like the formalized [[buck dance|buck-dancing]] competitions of Tammany Hall, where judges sat beside, before, and beneath the stage to evaluate the [dancers'] clarity, speed, and presentation. The Hoofers Club comprised a more informal panel of peers, whose judgments could be cruel and mocking and were driven by an insistence on innovation. "Survive or die" was the credo. In an eccentric fusion of imitation and innovation, young dancers were forced to find their style and rhythmic voice. It was said that on the wall of the Hoofers Club was written: "Thou shalt not copy each other's steps — Exactly."&lt;ref name="Valis87"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tap Dancing America: A Cultural History|author=Hill, Constance Valis|pages=87|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rU9dUaCsd94C&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hoofers%20club%22&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-19-539082-7|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though he frequently took opportunities to explain the difference between tap and hoofing to the press in later years,&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brief" /&gt; and tended to refer to himself as a hoofer rather than a tap dancer,&lt;ref name="arts.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt; Sims did practice both forms of dance. In 1949, motivated by the death of [[Bill "Bojangles" Robinson]], Sims became a founding member of the [[Original Copasetics]], another fellowship of tap dancers that became a source of mentor-student relationships and would help bring about the revival of tap in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="NYT09"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/arts/dance/25brown.html|title=Ernest Brown, Last Member of the Original Tapping Copasetics, Dies at 93|author=Dunning, Jennifer|date=August 25, 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decline and revival of tap ==
Tap dancing lost popularity with audiences beginning in the late 1940s. A number of causes factored into this decline, among them the going out of style of vaudeville-style variety shows; a new tax that forced many ballrooms to close and thus closed venues to the big bands with whom tap dancers had used to perform; trends in music that favored smaller, more intimate groups of performers; and concomitant increases in interest among audiences in watching formal modern dance and ballet performances. Sims was quoted as having said of the period that "[t]ap didn't die ... It was just neglected."&lt;ref name="ValisShort"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypl.org/sites/default/files/TAPENCY2002cites.pdf|format=PDF|author=Hill, Constance Valis|title=Tap Dance in America: A Very Short History|year=2002|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With paying gigs harder to find and paying less, Sims turned to other sources of income. Despite not having had any formal instruction himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F04E3DD163AE334BC4C52DFBF66838C669EDE|author = McDonagh, Don|title = Dance: Taps Close Fete|work = The New York Times|date = September 14, 1977|page = 63|quote = Howard (Sandman) Sims, a specialist in the art who swore that he never took a lesson in his life...|accessdate = September 4, 2015}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;!-- please do not add this template to the other NYT citations on this page, the 1977 articles are subscriber-only but the others are open-access --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; he taught dance, including to such later stars as [[Gregory Hines]] and [[Ben Vereen]].&lt;ref name="VIBE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT87" /&gt; He also taught footwork to boxing greats [[Sugar Ray Robinson]] and [[Muhammad Ali]].&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT87" /&gt; Less glamorously, he ran a café, and even worked as a carpenter and a mechanic.&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brief" /&gt; Despite the lean times for hoofers, Sims was always able to put food on the table for his family, having married in 1959.&lt;ref name="US1" /&gt;

The late 1960s brought the beginning of a wave of nostalgia for tap, and Sims found his dance skills in demand again. In 1969, he was part of the all-star cast of ''Tap Happening'', a [[revue]] that played [[Off-Broadway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Before, Between, and Beyond: Three Decades of Dance Writing|author=Banes, Sally|page=79|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-299-22154-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2xLfSJTTCcC&amp;pg=PA79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valis212"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tap Dancing America: A Cultural History|author=Hill, Constance Valis|pages=212–214|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rU9dUaCsd94C&amp;pg=PA212|isbn=978-0-19-539082-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tap Happening'' was popular enough to run for several years.&lt;ref name="Brief"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biography.jrank.org/pages/2431/Sims-Howard-Sandman.html|title=Howard 'Sandman' Sims Biography — Developed Unique Dance Style, Rediscovered by Tap Aficionados, Cited as an Innovator, Selected works|author=Edelman, Rob|work=Brief Biographies|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crescendo]] of interest in tap dancing continued, and in 1972, Sims danced in the production ''Best of the Hoofers'' at the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980CE7DE1F3EE63BBC4953DFB0668389669EDE|title=Tap Show Propels Fans and Dancers; 'Best of the Hoofers' Brings Old Spirit to Orpheum|author=Kisselgoff, Anna|work=The New York Times|page=50|date=June 1, 1972|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Hoofing is not a dying art form," he asserted in 1977,&lt;ref name="NYT77" /&gt; and subsequent events would prove him right.

1979 saw the release of ''[[No Maps on My Taps]]'', which featured Sims facing off against fellow tap stars [[Chuck Green]]—who had served as Sims's mentor during his early years in New York—and [[Bunny Briggs]], in a three-way dance challenge.&lt;ref name="arts.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JumpCut" /&gt; The documentary also reunited him with bandleader [[Lionel Hampton]], whom he had toured with in years past.&lt;ref name="JumpCut" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

In 1980, a far cry from the tiny venues he had been lucky to play just a few years earlier, Sims performed before a crowd of 2,600 fans at the [[Lincoln Center]] during the [[Newport Jazz Festival]].&lt;ref name="Valis249"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tap Dancing America: A Cultural History|author=Hill, Constance Valis|pages=249–250|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rU9dUaCsd94C&amp;pg=PA249|isbn=978-0-19-539082-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Sims was one of the instructor-performers of the ''By Word of Foot'' "teach-in" series, spending a week demonstrating his hoofing techniques for a new generation of tap enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="Valis249" /&gt;

As part of New York's leg of the 1981 Newport Jazz Festival (which spanned both NYC and its home city of [[Newport, Rhode Island]], that year), he performed with former [[Cotton Club]] bandleader [[Cab Calloway]] in a production called ''Stompin' at the Savoy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/27/arts/jazz-events.html|title=Jazz Events|work=The New York Times|date=June 27, 1981|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, Sims was on stage at the [[American Dance Festival]], dancing both with and without his sandbox.&lt;ref name="NYT81"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/19/arts/dance-festival-looks-at-vaudeville.html|title=Dance: Festival Looks at Vaudeville|author=Anderson, Jack|work=The New York Times|date=July 19, 1981|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1982, Sims was part of a promotional tour reviving interest in ''No Maps on My Taps'' with co-stars Bunny Briggs and Chuck Green, their pre-screening performances backed by Cab Calloway.&lt;ref name="Valis282"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tap Dancing America: A Cultural History|author=Hill, Constance Valis|page=282|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rU9dUaCsd94C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;source=bl#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tap%20happening%22%20sandman%20sims&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-19-539082-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even as booked performances were coming more regularly, Sims never stopped participating in street-corner challenges, encouraging younger generations of dancers and inviting them to learn his moves.&lt;ref name="arts.gov" /&gt;

The [[National Endowment for the Arts]] granted Sims a $5,000 National Heritage Fellowship in 1984.&lt;ref name="arts.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/people-news/howard-sandman-sims-1117887335/|title=Howard 'Sandman' Sims: Dancer, Apollo Theater stage manager|date=June 3, 2003|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I thought I was making noise all these years," Sims said of the award. "Now they're calling it culture."&lt;ref name="NYTobit" /&gt; He used the funds to teach dance to children in Harlem, using a parking lot in lieu of a formal dance studio, drawing on his own youth learning dance on the street.&lt;ref name="arts.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt; Sims would later explain, "most people wait [to study dance] until after they've grown up—and then it's too late."&lt;ref name="LATimes86" /&gt; That same year, [[clogging|clogger]] [[Ira Bernstein]] received an NEA Folk Arts Apprenticeship grant "[t]o study traditional [B]lack tap dance with master dancer Howard 'Sandman' Sims."&lt;ref name="apprenticeship"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.gov/sites/default/files/NEA-Annual-Report-1984.pdf|format=PDF|title=Annual Report 1984|publisher=National Endowment for the Arts official site|page=67|editor=Bowersox, Joan|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sims loved to teach; his son recounted how Sandman would "stop every kid he saw and show them a step and get them to copy a step. He enjoyed that more than performing in front of an audience."&lt;ref name="US1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetoninfo.com/index.php/component/us1more/?key=11-19-2008%20Hoofer|title=The Legacy of a Harlem Hoofer|author=Fox, Barbara Figge|work=[[U.S. 1 (newspaper)|U.S. 1]]|date=November 19, 2008|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Apollo reopens ===
Meanwhile, Harlem's Apollo Theater, where Sims had served for years as Amateur Night's "executioner", had been closed for most of a decade.&lt;ref name="PI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1986-02-19/entertainment/26086876_1_apollo-theater-security-guard-amateur-night|title=Joy And Tears At The Apollo|author=Logan, Joe|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=February 19, 1986|accessdate=September 3, 2015|quote=Sims had danced on stage, giving an act its cue to leave.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, following an extensive renovation, the venue reopened in 1985,&lt;ref name="PI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; bringing increased attention to both the Apollo and his role there. "I'm their protector, not the executioner," he explained to ''[[The Washington Post]]''. "Because that audience can get really hostile."&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; Sims described seeing displeased audiences throw bottles and even horseshoes at performers who he did not hustle off stage fast enough.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT87"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/18/nyregion/column-one-about-new-york-amateurs-on-stage-semiamateur-critics.html|title=Amateurs on Stage, Semiamateur Critics|author=Geist, William E.|work=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1987|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''[[The New York Times]]'' interviewed him about his "executioner" role, he said of the acts that got booed off, "I tell them to work on their act and come back," encouraging them to try again.&lt;ref name="NYT87" /&gt;

In 1986, Sims starred in ''The Tap Tradition'' at [[Symphony Space]] New York (which also hosted a showing of ''No Maps on My Taps''), earning a rave review from ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name="NYT86"&gt;{{cite web|author=Anderson, Jack|title=The Dance: Sandman Sims on Tap|date=March 2, 1986|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/02/arts/the-dance-sandman-sims-on-tap.html|page=64|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made a brief appearance in a play based on his life, ''The Sand Dancer'',&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt; which was written by poet Sandra Hochman and starred [[LeLand Gantt]], and which received another rave review:&lt;ref name="US1" /&gt; "Sims is a virtuoso among virtuosos—in a class by himself. To say Mr. Sims dances on sand is like saying [[Philippe Petit]] is a tightrope walker."&lt;ref name="NYTplay" /&gt; And he traveled to Los Angeles to perform in a production called ''Essence of Rhythm'' with fellow tap stars including [[Charles Coles|Charles "Honi" Coles]] and [[Jimmy Slyde]].&lt;ref name="LATimes86" /&gt;

Sandman Sims was the guest star of ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' on May 14, 1987.&lt;ref name="Dave"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/late-night-with-david-letterman/show-0858-870514-178083/|title= Late Night With David Letterman – Season 6 – Episode 40 — Show #0858 (870514)|website=TV.com|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[It's Showtime at the Apollo]]'', a TV broadcast of the Apollo Theater's Amateur Night performances, began broadcasting in September 1987 on [[NBC]] stations, bringing awareness of Sims's "executioner" role to a wider audience.&lt;ref name="Showtime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/showtime-at-the-apollo/|title=Showtime at the Apollo: Show Summary|website=TV.com|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particularly busy year, 1988 saw Sims tour the world as a cultural ambassador on behalf of the U.S. State Department, traveling to over 50 countries in a span of 11 months.&lt;ref name="Tribune" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt;

By 1989, Sims's popularity was at an all-time high, and he told the Associated Press, "I can't fulfill all the work they give me. ... I can't walk out on the street without somebody showing me a time step."&lt;ref name="Tribune" /&gt; Tap dancing's popularity was nearing a new peak as well, with three major American cities ([[Houston, Texas]]; [[Portland, Oregon]]; [[Washington, D.C.]]) hosting tap-dance festivals.&lt;ref name="Tribune" /&gt; In movie theaters, the dance drama ''[[Tap (film)|Tap]]'' was introducing Sims's footwork (and that of his former student Gregory Hines) to audiences who had never had the opportunity to see him perform before.&lt;ref name=NYT89&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/10/movies/review-film-tapping-and-strutting-into-a-whirl-of-romance.html|title=Review/Film; Tapping and Strutting Into a Whirl of Romance|author=Canby, Vincent|work=The New York Times|date=February 10, 1989|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the episode, Cliff Huxtable ([[Bill Cosby]]) challenged "Mr. Sims" to a dance-off, part tribute to and part parody of Sims's real-life tap challenges, which Sims won handily.&lt;ref name="Dict" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TV.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-cosby-show/mr-sandman-12883/|title=The Cosby Show – Season – 6 – Episode 19 — Mr. Sandman|website=TV.com|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same year, the Apollo Theater played host to Rat-a-Tat-Tap, another tap-dance festival, and the Sandman, "always a deserved audience favorite at tap festivals," was a featured performer there alongside his ''Tap'' co-stars [[Savion Glover]] and [[Gregory Hines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/05/arts/review-dance-feet-bringers-of-thunder-rat-a-tat-tap-at-apollo.html|title=Feet, Bringers of Thunder: Rat-a-Tat-Tap at Apollo|author=Anderson, Jack|work=The New York Times|date=July 5, 1990|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the New York Committee to Celebrate National Tap Dance Day and the Young People's Tap Conference honored Sandman Sims for his contributions to the art of hoofing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytap.org/1998yptc.html|title=Hotcha-Razz-Ma-Tap Conference|publisher=New York Committee to Celebrate National Tap Dance Day official site|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
Sandman Sims, particularly in his role as Apollo Theater executioner, has been referenced frequently in African-American culture.
* While a cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the '90s, [[Chris Rock]] played recurring character Nat X, a [[Black Power movement|Black Power]] talk show host. Sometimes, when at the culmination of a tirade against a guest, Nat X would send "The Sandman" (played by [[Chris Farley]] in a clown suit) to sweep the guest off the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/chris-rock-14736/character/nat-x-66231|title=Nat X on "SNL"|author=Rock, Chris|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 5, 2000, he was invoked by [[Huey Freeman]] in the long-running comic strip ''[[The Boondocks (comic strip)|The Boondocks]]'', who responded to an ineptly-told joke by saying, "Where is Sandman Sims when you need him ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/boondocks/2015/06/17|title=The Boondocks Comic Strip, June 17, 2015 on GoComics.com|author=McGruder, Aaron|work=The Boondocks|date=April 5, 2000|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- the June 17, 2015 date is when GoComics reposted the comic, but the original publication date is visible on the strip image. --&gt;
* Performance artist [[Holly Bass]], along with other dancers, put on another play about Sims's life at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[American History Museum]] (which was then hosting an exhibit on the Apollo Theater) on July 10, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/weekend-events-korean-film-gullah-stories-and-remembering-howard-sandman-sims-34589/|title=Weekend Events: Korean Film, Gullah Stories and Remembering Howard 'Sandman' Sims|author=Rhodes, Jesse|work=Smithsonian magazine|date=July 9, 2010|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]], referring to his own performance singing on the Apollo Theater stage (albeit not on Amateur Night) the evening before his [[2012 State of the Union address]], said, "Sandman did not come out!"&lt;ref name="Nakamura"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/44/post/obama-jokes-with-spike-lee-performs-al-green-song-at-new-york-city-fundraisers/2012/01/20/gIQAJ7YRDQ_blog.html|title=Obama jokes with Spike Lee, performs Al Green song at New York City fundraisers|author=Nakamura, David|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 20, 2012|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="People" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
While Sims had a first marriage which produced his first child Diane Sims, he later married his second wife, Solange. They would have 1 son together, Howard Sims Jr.,&lt;ref name="Dance" /&gt; as well as 5 grandchildren and 1 great-grandchild.&lt;ref name="NYTobit" /&gt;

Particularly in later years, Sims sometimes claimed not to be certain of his birth year,&lt;ref name="arts.gov" /&gt; at times saying it was "a matter of opinion."&lt;ref name="LATimes86" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JumpCut" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt; Asked by a fan how old he was, Sims once replied, "Any number can play."&lt;ref name="NYT86" /&gt;

== Death ==
Sims died on May 20, 2003 in New York City. He had suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name="Brief" /&gt;

A memorial service for Sims was held May 28, 2003 at the Apollo Theater.&lt;ref name="Dance" /&gt;

An '''illuminated procession''' is a [[procession]] held after dark so that lights carried by the participants form a spectacle.  The lights will commonly be of the same type, so making a '''candlelight procession''', '''lantern parade''' or '''torchlight march'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Torch Light |url=https://www.amazon.com/J5-Tactical-V1-Pro-Flashlight-Original/dp/B00V7T1YRQ|accessdate=7 June 2013|author=Beverly N. White}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include the Christmas festival of [[Ndocciata]] in Italy; the Chinese [[Lantern Festival]] to celebrate the first full moon; and the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes#The Torchlight Procession|daily procession of pilgrims to the grotto of Lourdes]].

What is believed to be the largest and the best illuminated procession in the world is the [[Bridgwater Guy Fawkes Carnival]] held on the first Saturday of November in the town of Bridgwater, Somerset, in the UK. It is followed by a fireworks display that is unique to the town, known as squibbing. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bridgwatercarnival.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; The carnival parades also take place in a variety of Somerset towns throughout November.

'''Illustrated fiction''' is a hybrid narrative medium in which images and text work together to tell a story.  It can take various forms, including fiction written for adults or children, magazine fiction, comic strips, and picture books.&lt;ref name=Sillars&gt;Sillars, Stuart, 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hpjWh_Q-KJ8C&amp;dq ''Visualisation in Popular Fiction, 1860-1960''], Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-11914-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Illustrated fiction in the 18th century ==
Apart from an occasional portrait or map, 18th century fiction was not usually illustrated, as publishers did not commission illustrations for new novels. In the novel ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]'', the author [[Henry Fielding]] refers to paintings by [[William Hogarth]] in order to explain what some of his characters look like.&lt;ref name=Charlespg4&gt;Cohen, Jane R., 1980, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2UhBswddDsEC ''Charles Dickens and His Original Illustrators''], Ohio State University Press, {{ISBN|0-8142-0284-5}}, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Illustrations were commissioned for already successful books. These illustrated versions were usually published as limited editions and sold through prior subscription. [[Henry Fuseli]] created a single frontispiece for the fourth edition of [[Tobias Smollett]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle]]''. [[Thomas Stothard]] provided several illustrations for an edition of ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]'' published 30 years after its first publication in 1766.&lt;ref name=Charlespg4/&gt;

Near the end of the 18th century, new mechanical techniques allowed pictures to be printed cheaply. Illustrated classics became cheaply available, and were strongly remembered by their readers. [[John Ruskin]] was moved by illustrations of [[Robinson Crusoe]] crashing into rocks and escaping his wreck. [[Charles Dickens]] remembered the illustrations in many books more than the prose itself.&lt;ref name=Charlespg4/&gt;

== Illustrated fiction in the 19th century ==
[[File:George Cruikshank Oliver Twist.gif|thumb|250px|right|"Please, sir, I want some more." From ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', illustration by [[George Cruikshank]].]]
At the beginning of the 19th century, illustration increased the sales of previously published fiction. In 1836, the publication of Charles Dickens's ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' in an illustrated serialized format revolutionised the publication of new fiction.&lt;ref name=Charlespg4/&gt; The popularity of the original illustrations in Dickens's novels was unprecedented, and helped to popularize the use of illustrations in serious fiction.&lt;ref name=Charlespg229-233&gt;Cohen 1980, page 229-233.&lt;/ref&gt; This revolution lasted until 1870, as other authors and published attempted to emulate Dickens's success. Illustrations became common in the period. For publishers, new fiction with illustrations published serially was less of a commercial risk than the traditional unillustrated three-volume sets. Illustrations attracted readers and increased advertising revenue. Illustrations were used as advertisement's in booksellers windows.&lt;ref name=Charlespg4/&gt;
 
During the 19th century, the use of photomechanical techniques decreased the cost of reproducing illustrations. Both colour and black and white illustrations were increasingly used in daily, weekly, and monthly publications. Publishers sold a great deal of one-volume hardcovers and periodical serials.&lt;ref name=Charlespg229-233/&gt;

Dickens's novels were well-suited to graphic representation. Dickens believed that the drawings that illustrated his fiction were valuable,&lt;ref name=Charlespg229-233/&gt; despite some critics urging him not to use them. Most of his major works were originally published with illustrations. He was intensely involved in the creation of most of the 900 original illustrations of his writing. These illustrations were produced by 18 artists,&lt;ref name=Charlespg3&gt;Cohen 1980, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[George Cruikshank]] and [[Robert Seymour (illustrator)|Robert Seymour]].&lt;ref name=Charlespg6&gt;Cohen 1980, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of [[William Harrison Ainsworth|William Ainsworth]]'s, [[Charles Lever]]'s, [[William Thackeray]]'s, and [[Anthony Trollope]]'s major works were initially published in illustrated monthly parts. Later, novelists preferred to publish their writing in illustrated magazines. [[Thomas Hardy]] often did this. [[George Meredith]] did this twice, and [[George Eliot]] once.&lt;ref name=Charlespg5&gt;Cohen 1980, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; 19th century author artists included [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and [[George du Maurier]].&lt;ref name=Charlespg229-233/&gt;

Many artists began their careers illustrating fiction. Illustrating was a difficult and badly paid job. [[Hablot Knight Browne]] was one of the few very talented artists to pursue illustrating full-time. Most artists, such as [[Marcus Stone]] and [[Luke Fildes]], used illustrating as a stepping-stone to a career in painting. Other artists like [[George Cattermole]] and [[Daniel Maclise]] supplemented their income by providing illustrations.&lt;ref name=Charlespg6/&gt;

The popularity of illustrated fiction began to decline in the late 19th century, as illustrations lost their novelty and no longer guaranteed that a novel would sell well.&lt;ref name=Charlespg229-233/&gt; Technological improvements in printing flooded the market with affordable novels with illustrations of high quality. Prestigious artists including [[John Everett Millais]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], and [[Frederick Leighton]] started to illustrate books. Illustrations challenged the novel's prose, implying a failure in prose's self-sufficiency.&lt;ref name=Elliottpg47&gt;Elliott, Kamilla, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GM7TqTLYKogC ''Rethinking the Novel/Film Debate''], Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-81844-3}}, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Prose frequently took second place to illustration.&lt;ref name=Elliottpg48&gt;Elliott 2003, page 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Illustrated fiction in the 20th century ==
The amount of illustrated fiction that was published declined from the beginning of the 20th century to the 1930s. By the 1930s, illustrations were rarely used in adult's novels.&lt;ref name=Elliottpg49&gt;Elliott 2003, page 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrated serious fiction was not popular over the rest of the century. The decline in the publication of serials, rise in labour costs, and competition from film, television, and photojournalism contributed to its decline. There was also less demand from readers.&lt;ref name=Charlespg229-233/&gt; Historians of Western illustrated fiction mostly agree that film replaced the illustrated book.&lt;ref name=Stampg10&gt;Stam, Robert, and Raengo, Alessandra, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aA6VaCzSyCYC ''A Companion to Literature and Film''], Blackwell Publishing, {{ISBN|0-631-23053-X}}, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the 1915 film adaptation of ''Vanity Fair'' said that "the reels make a set of illustrations superior to the conventional pen-pictures of a deluxe edition."&lt;ref name=Elliottpg51&gt;Elliott 2003, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern literary fiction was often not well-suited to illustration, for example the introspective novels of [[E. M. Forster]] and [[Virginia Woolf]]. Illustrations were used on book covers to attract buyers, but not used within the novel. Similar to the period before 1836, illustrations were not commissioned for new books, but were commissioned for established classics, usually for a limited luxury edition. Serious novels are not illustrated, and illustrated fiction is generally associated with serialized or short fiction that is published in popular but not intellectually prestigious magazines. Children and comics readers became the only fiction readers whose fiction was generally illustrated.&lt;ref name=Charlespg229-233/&gt;

Some authors were concerned that illustrations would date or misinterpret their prose.&lt;ref name=Charlespg229-233/&gt; [[Henry James]] disliked illustrations, claiming that illustrations were not needed because prose was sufficiently pictorial. He thought that illustrations and prose were in competition with one another.&lt;ref name=Elliottpg48/&gt; He permitted his travel books, but not his mature fiction, to be illustrated. [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]]'s photographs were used in the New York edition of his works only as [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]]s, and only after James reassured himself that they did not compete or make a reference to his prose. Similar to James, Thomas Hardy increasingly excluded illustrations from the collected editions of his novels, with the exception of maps that he had drawn and photographic frontispieces.&lt;ref name=Charlespg229-233/&gt;

None of the first or standard editions of [[James Joyce]]'s novels were illustrated during his lifetime, except for an edition of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' published by the Limited Editions Club in 1935, which included drawings and etchings by [[Henri Matisse]]. [[Pearl Buck]]'s husband [[Richard J. Walsh]], as editor of [[Asia (magazine)|Asia]], included illustrations with Buck's work that was published there in serial or complete form. However, as editor and later president of the [[John Day Company]], he did not include illustrations in the subsequent hardcover editions of these novels. When [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s novella ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' was first published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in 1952, it was illustrated with blue-tinted drawings by [[Noel Sickles]]. These illustrations were not included in its first publication in volume form, published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons]].&lt;ref name=Charlespg229-233/&gt;   
   
In the middle of the 20th century, the comic strip using visual images to convey action were a great influence on children and young people.&lt;ref name=Sillars/&gt; Comic books had a unique storytelling potential.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, Robert C., 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vAH24kOdCq8C ''The Art of the Comic Book: An Aesthetic History''] University Press of Mississippi, {{ISBN|0-87805-758-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Mulholland''' (9 June 1898 in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]] &amp;ndash; 25 February 1970 in [[New York City]]) was an American [[Magic (illusion)|magician]], author, publisher and [[Espionage|intelligence agent]].

==Life and work==

Mulholland learned the art of magic as a teenager with John William Sargent, President of the [[Society of American Magicians]]. Mulholland was a professional magician for two decades, working in small companies and large stage shows. He ran one of the first magic workshops and was from 1930 the editor of the magical trade magazine ''[[The Sphinx: An Independent Magazine for Magicians|The Sphinx]]''. He published many books on magic and its history.

Mulholland was a close friend of [[Harry Houdini]].&lt;ref&gt;Basbanes, Nicholas A. (1995). ''A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books''. Henry Holt and Company. p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; Mulholland asserted that "Houdini once told me that he considered no man to be a magician until he was able skillfully to perform the [[cups and balls]]."&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Thomas James. (1937). ''Cups and Balls Magic''. Kanter's Magic Shop. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

His other friends included [[Gene Tunney]], [[Harold Ross]] and Bert Terhune.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15276667/new_york_day_by_day_by_o_o_mcintyre/|title=New York Day by Day by O. O. McIntyre, John Mullholland (1936)|date=1936-09-09|work=Valley Morning Star|access-date=2017-11-21|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, he was the only foreign officer in the British Magical Society, and by that time had studied his craft in 42 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15276716/flowers_will_grow_before_your_eyes_in/|title=Flowers will grow before your eyes in Rainbow show, John Mullholland (1939)|date=1939|work=El Paso Herald-Post|access-date=2017-11-21|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], he wrote a spellbook for soldiers. His impressive collection is now owned by [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]]. 

He was the editor of the Conjurer's Journal and was the only living magician listed in the book [[Who’s Who in America|''Who's who in America'']] immediately after the death of [[Howard Thurston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15276565/magicians_to_entertain_by_clever/|title=Magicians to entertain by clever tricks, John Mullholland (1936)|date=1936-05-07|work=Enterprise-Journal|access-date=2017-11-21|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He left his editorial position at ''The Sphinx'' in 1953, officially due to health problems but actually to work for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].

During the [[Cold War]], Mulholland was paid by the CIA to write a manual on [[deception]] and [[Misdirection (magic)|misdirection]]. Copies of the document were believed to have been destroyed in 1973, however, copies later resurfaced and were published as "The Official CIA Manual of Trickery and Deception".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2009/11/cias-lost-magic-manual-resurfaces/ "CIA's Lost Magic Manual Resurfaces"]. Retrieved 24 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, magician Ben Robinson authored ''The Magician: John Mulholland's Secret Life'' which documented his work with the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/secret-cia-magic-manual-reveals-cold-war-spy/story?id=9229248 "Secret CIA 'Magic' Manual Reveals Cold War Spy Tricks"]. Retrieved 24 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skepticism==

Mulholland had criticized the claims of [[parapsychology]] and exposed the tricks of fraudulent spiritualist [[Mediumship|mediums]]. His book ''Beware Familiar Spirits'' (1938) revealed many of these tricks.&lt;ref name="Review 1938"&gt;The New Books. [http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1938nov26-00022 ''Review of Beware Familiar Spirits'']. The Saturday Review. November 26, 1938. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Earle Jerome. (1987). ''Magic: A Reference Guide''. Greenwood Press. p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; 

A review which highly praised the book, stated that Mulholland had "been sworn at, threatened, and even shot at while acquiring the information".&lt;ref name="Review 1938"/&gt;

In 1952 for ''[[Popular Science]]'', he published a skeptical article on [[flying saucer]]s and [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]].

'''List of world expositions''' is an annotated list of every [[World's fair|world exposition]] sanctioned by the [[Bureau International des Expositions]] (BIE), including those recognised retrospectively as they took place (long) before BIE came into existence.

The designation "World Exposition" or "Expo" refers to a class of the largest, general scope exhibitions of 3 to 6 months' duration.

This list does not include BIE recognized International Horticultural Exhibitions. For other major international exhibitions, in addition to those endorsed by the BIE, see the comprehensive [[list of world's fairs]].

'''''Lowlife''''' is a semi-autobiographical [[comic book]] series written and drawn by [[Ed Brubaker]], originally published by [[Caliber Comics]] and later [[Aeon Press]]. Collected editions were put out by Aeon and [[Black Eye Books]].

The ''Comics Journal'' described the book as following the "frustration and cynicism of disenchanted [[slacker]] kids finding excitement in their uneventful lives."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcj.com/2_archives/r_Pr2Sm.html "''Like Teen President'' to ''Smell of Steve''"], ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #79&lt;/ref&gt; The series was described by ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'' as "part fiction, part autobiography, the narratives hover between sincerity and parody, with moments of transcendence that lift it out of the realm of the ordinary comic book."{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Brubaker cited his work here as an influence on later works:
{{cquote|I'm exploring the same themes in my ''[[Batman]]'' comics and my ''[[Catwoman (comic book)|Catwoman]]'' comics that I was probably exploring in ''Lowlife'': family relationships, personal relationships, people not being able to escape their past. . . . That's the stuff that interests me, and that's the stuff I write about.&lt;ref name=newsarama /&gt;}}

==Development and publication history==
''Lowlife'' was Brubaker's first professional work.&lt;ref name=newsarama&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=144764 "Behind the Page: Ed Brubaker I"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Newsarama]], January 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is semi-autobiographical, based upon the lives of the author and his friends but "with the names changed."&lt;ref name=newsarama /&gt;

''Lowlife'' debuted in 1992 with two issues published by [[Caliber Comics]]. Issues #3–5 were published in 1994–1995 by the [[MU Press]] imprint [[Aeon Press]].

==Collected editions==
The series has been collected into a number of [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]]:
*''The Portable Lowlife'' (48 pages, [[Aeon]], 1995, {{ISBN|1-883847-16-8}})
*''A Complete Lowlife'' (112 pages, Black Eye Books, 1997, {{ISBN|0-9698874-7-7}}, [[Top Shelf Productions]], 2001, {{ISBN|1-891830-20-1}})

'''Mor lam sing''' ([[Thai language|Thai]]/[[Isan language|Isan]] หมอลำซิ่ง) is a fast-paced, racy and modernized version of the traditional [[Laos|Lao]]/[[Isan]] song form ''[[mor lam]] (for ex:in 1986) ''.  ''Sing'' comes from the [[English language|English]] word "racing" (a reference to the music's speed and its origins among Isan's [[motorcycle|biker]] fraternity). In this style, the lead singer is accompanied by the ''[[khaen]]'', Western [[drum]]s, [[electric guitar]], electric [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s and [[bass guitar]].   The style was invented in [[Chaiyaphum province]] around 1985 and was popularised over the next few years after it was taken up by Ratdri Sivilai in [[Khon Kaen]]. It is based on the Khon Kaen style of ''lam tang san ''but incorporates string instrumentation and [[luk thung]] singing styles and extensive use of the Central [[Thai language]] rather than [[Isan language|Isan]].

[[Image:Lamperformance02.JPG|thumb|250px|right|A live performance of ''mor lam sing''.]]

The songs are often about disappointment in love and hardships during life away from Northeast Thailand. The songs are full of sexual innuendo, and feature "''hang khreuang''" - young female dancers in fanciful dress.

Among the most popular ''mor lam sing'' artists are the groups [[Rock Salaeng]] and [[Rock Sadert]].

'''Narrative film''', '''fictional film''' or '''fiction film'''  is a [[film]] that tells a [[fictional]] or fictionalized story, event or [[narrative]]. In this style of film, believable narratives and characters help convince the audience that the unfolding fiction is real. Lighting and camera movement, among other cinematic elements, have become increasingly important in these films. Great detail goes into the [[screenplay]]s of narratives, as these films rarely deviate from the predetermined behaviours and lines of the classical style of [[screenplay]] writing to maintain a sense of realism. Actors must deliver dialogue and action in a believable way, so as to persuade the audience that the film is real life.

==General==
Probably the first fictional film ever made was the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière's]] ''L'Arroseur arrosé'', which was first screened at the Grand Café Capucines on December 28, 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Alison McMahan, ''Alice Guy Blaché, Lost Visionary of the Cinema'' (New York: Continuum, 2002) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later in 1896, [[Alice Guy-Blaché]] directed the fictional film ''La fee aux choux''. Yet perhaps the best known of early fictional films is [[Georges Méliès]]’s ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' from 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Leveridge, “Fantastic voyages of the cinematic imagination: George Méliès’s Trip to the Moon” ''Early Popular Visual Culture'' (May 2012), 10 (2), pg. 197-199&lt;/ref&gt; Most films previous to this had been merely moving images of everyday occurrences, such as ''[[L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat]]'' by [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]]. Méliès was one of the first directors to progress cinematic technology, which paved the way for narratives as style of film.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Leveridge, “Fantastic voyages of the cinematic imagination: George Méliès’s Trip to the Moon” ''Early Popular Visual Culture'' (May 2012), 10 (2), pg. 197-199&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative films have come so far since their introduction that [[film genres]] such as [[comedy]] or [[Western (genre)|Western]] films, were, and continue to be introduced as a way to further categorize these films.&lt;ref&gt;Barsam, Richard Meran and Dave Monahan. ''Looking at Movies: An Introduction to Film''. New York: W.W. Norton &amp;, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative cinema is usually contrasted to films that present information, such as a nature [[Documentary film|documentary]], as well as to some [[experimental film]]s (works such as [[Wavelength (1966 film)|''Wavelength'']] by [[Michael Snow]], ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]'' by [[Dziga Vertov]], or films by [[Chantal Akerman]]). In some instances pure documentary films, while [[nonfiction]], may nonetheless recount a story. As genres evolve, from fiction film and [[documentary]] a [[Wiktionary:hybrid|hybrid]] one emerged, [[docufiction]].

Many films are based on real occurrences, however these too fall under the category of a “narrative film” rather than a [[Documentary film|documentary]]. This is because films based on real occurrences are not simply footage of the occurrence, but rather hired actors portraying an adjusted, often more dramatic, retelling of the occurrence (such as ''[[21 (2008 film)|21]]'' by [[Robert Luketic]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barsam, Richard Meran and Dave Monahan. ''Looking at Movies: An Introduction to Film''. New York: W.W. Norton &amp;, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike literary fiction, which is typically based on characters, situations and events that are entirely imaginary/fictional/hypothetical, cinema always has a real referent, called the "pro-filmic", which encompasses everything existing and done in front of the camera.

Since the emergence of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classical Hollywood]] style in the early 20th century, during which films were selected to be made based on the popularity of the genre, stars, producers, and directors involved, narrative, usually in the form of the [[feature film]], has held dominance in commercial cinema and has become popularly synonymous with "the movies."&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, E. Ann. ''Women and Film: Both Sides of the Camera''. New York: Methuen, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Classical, invisible filmmaking (what is often called [[realism (arts)|realist]] fiction) is central to this popular definition. This key element of this invisible filmmaking lies in [[continuity editing]].

A '''one-liner''' is a [[joke]] that is delivered in a single line. A good one-liner is said to be [[wikt:pithy|pithy]] - concise and meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;The Unuttered Punch Line:Pragmatic Incongruity and the Parsing of “What’s the Difference” Jokes, K.E.L. Miller, [http://engling.truman.edu/SeniorSem/PDFpapers/Miller%20paper%20PDF.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Comedians and actors use this comedic method as part of their act, e.g. [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Tommy Cooper]], [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[Norm Macdonald]], [[Ken Dodd]], [[Stewart Francis]], [[Zach Galifianakis]], [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[Anthony Jeselnik]], [[Milton Jones]], [[Shappi Khorsandi]], [[Jay London]], [[Mark Linn-Baker]], [[Demetri Martin]], [[Groucho Marx]], [[Dan Mintz]], [[Emo Philips]], [[Tim Vine]], [[Steven Wright]] and [[Henny Youngman]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].{{cn|date=September 2016}} Many fictional characters are also known to deliver one-liners, including [[James Bond]], who usually includes pithy and laconic quips after disposing of a villain.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

The '''Perry Mason syndrome''' is the manner in which the television crime drama ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' (1957&amp;ndash;1966) may have affected perceptions of the [[United States legal system]] among [[defendant]]s and [[juror]]s.

==Typical ''Perry Mason'' episode==
In a typical episode of ''Perry Mason'', a series involving a fictional Los Angeles defense attorney which initially ran from September 1957 to May 1966, the first half of the show usually depicted the prospective murder victim as being deserving of homicide, often with Mason's client publicly threatening to kill the victim. After Mason's client is charged with murder, during the [[preliminary hearing]] for the trial Mason would establish his client's innocence by dramatically demonstrating the guilt of another character.&lt;ref name="Leitch"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Leitch |first=Thomas |authorlink= |title=Perry Mason |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=2005 |location=Detroit |pages=28–29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLi1H936-1kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0-8143-3121-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real murderer would nearly always break down and confess to the crime in the courtroom, often while on the witness stand.&lt;ref name="Leitch"/&gt;

== Jurors ==
The Perry Mason syndrome purports that, due to the oversimplified manner in which trial proceedings were presented on the popular crime drama ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', jurors who watched the program would enter trials with misconceptions about how the legal process works.&lt;ref name="Dictator"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Great Electronic Dictator | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/61/5/684 | author = Boorstin, Daniel J. | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | date = May 1978 | page = 684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the Perry Mason syndrome greatly reinforced the [[presumption of innocence]] of the defendant, which may have been problematic when the defendant was [[Guilt (law)|guilty]].&lt;ref name="Lippman"&gt;{{cite news | title = The actor who has played Perry Mason on... | url = http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-09-16/news/1993259073_1_perry-mason-mason-syndrome-played-perry | author = Lippman Jr., Theo | date = 16 September 1993 | publisher = Baltimore Sun | accessdate = 25 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that, because Perry Mason was often able to cause [[witness]]es to [[Confession (law)|confess]], jurors would expect similar "[[Perry Mason moment]]s" to occur in real trials as well.&lt;ref name="Symposium"&gt;{{cite conference | page = 11 | title = The Potential Impact of Television on Jurors | author = Podlas, Kimberlianne | url = http://projects.nfstc.org/ipes/presentations/Podlas_tv-jurors.pdf | conference = August 2010 Impression and Pattern Evidence Symposium | publisher = [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This shifted the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] from the [[prosecution]] to the defense.&lt;ref name="Symposium"/&gt; In one case, a juror told the defense attorney that the jury had voted to convict the defendant because the prosecution's key witness did not confess during [[cross-examination]].&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Impact of Television on the Jury System: Ancient Myths and Modern Realism | url = http://www.wcl.american.edu/journal/lawrev/40/graham.pdf?rd=1 | last =Graham |first=Fred | author-link = | journal = American University Law Review | year =1991 | volume = 40| issue =2 | page = 628 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20120304114716/http://www.wcl.american.edu/journal/lawrev/40/graham.pdf?rd=1|archive-date=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defendants ==
The Perry Mason syndrome has been cited as a reason some defendants would choose to appear ''[[pro se]]''&amp;mdash;representing oneself in court rather than being represented by a [[lawyer]]. The simplified portrayals of trials on the television series led some defendants to underestimate the seriousness of their predicaments.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Role of Standby Counsel: The Road From Faretta To Wiggins | last = Scott |first=Teresa A. | journal = Howard Law Journal | url = https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=27+How.+L.J.+1799&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=04c43a32488869fdf427836808d2c332 | year = 1984 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20160304040232/https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=27+How.+L.J.+1799&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=04c43a32488869fdf427836808d2c332|archive-date=March 4, 2016|subscription=true|publisher=[[LexisNexis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent viewers of the show may have also believed that they had gained an intimate understanding of the [[United States legal system]] and would be able to represent themselves better than an attorney could.&lt;ref name="Library"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Reference Librarian and the Pro Se Patron | author = Begg, Robert T. | journal = Law Library Journal | volume = 69 | page = 29 | ssrn = 1616815 | year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect may have been exacerbated by the tendency for [[news media]] to oversimplify their coverage of trial proceedings.&lt;ref name="Library"/&gt;

[[File:Betty Grable 20th Century Fox.jpg|thumb|[[Betty Grable]]'s famous pin-up photo from 1943]]
A '''pin-up model''' (known as a '''pin-up girl''' for a female and less commonly '''male pin-up''' for a male) is a [[model (person)|model]] whose mass-produced pictures see wide appeal as popular culture. Pin-ups are intended for informal display, i.e. meant to be "''pinned-up''" on a wall. Pin-up models may be [[glamour photography|glamour models]], fashion models, or actors. These pictures are also sometimes known as '''cheesecake''' photos.{{efn|''[[Merriam-Webster]] Online'' defines a "cheesecake" as "a photographic display of shapely and scantily clothed female figure".}} Cheesecake was an American slang word, that was considered a publicly acceptable term for seminude women because pin-up was considered taboo in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyerowitz|first=Joanne|date=1996|title=Women, Cheesecake, and Borderline Material: Responses to Girlie Pictures in the Mid-Twentieth-Century U.S.|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/363799/summary|journal=Journal of Women's History|language=en|volume=8|issue=3|pages=9–35|doi=10.1353/jowh.2010.0424|issn=1527-2036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''pin-up'' may refer to drawings, paintings, and other illustrations as well as photographs (see the [[list of pin-up artists]]). The term was first attested to in English in 1941;{{sfnp|Ayto|2006|p=126}} however, the practice is documented back at least to the 1890s. Pin-up images could be cut out of magazines or newspapers, or on a postcard or [[lithography|lithograph]]. Such pictures often appear on walls, desks, or calendars. [[Poster]]s of pin-ups were mass-produced, and became popular from the mid 20th century.

Male pin-ups were less common than their female counterparts throughout the 20th century, although a market for [[homoerotica]] has always existed as well as pictures of popular male celebrities targeted at women or girls. Examples include [[James Dean]] and [[Jim Morrison]].

==History==
Beginning in the early nineteenth century, pin-up modeling had "theatrical origins",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62281839|title=Pin-up grrrls : feminism, sexuality, popular culture|last=1971-|first=Buszek, Maria Elena,|date=2006|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822337347|location=Durham|oclc=62281839}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American burlesque|burlesque]] performers and actresses sometimes used photographic advertisement as business cards to advertise shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62281839|title=Pin-up grrrls : feminism, sexuality, popular culture|last=1971-|first=Buszek, Maria Elena,|date=2006|publisher=Duke University Press|year=|isbn=0822337347|location=Durham|pages=43|oclc=62281839}}&lt;/ref&gt; These adverts and business cards could often be found backstage in almost every theater's [[green room]], pinned-up or stuck into "frames of the looking-glasses, in the joints of the gas-burners, and sometimes lying on-top of the sacred cast-case itself." Understanding the power of photographic advertisements to promote their shows, burlesque women self-constructed their identity to make themselves visible. Being recognized not only within the theater itself but also outside challenged the conventions of women's place and women's potential in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pin-up grrrls: feminism, sexuality, popular culture|last=Buszek|first=Maria Elena|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2006|isbn=0-8223-3746-0|location=Duke University Press.|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; "To understand both the complicated identity and the subversive nature of the 19th-century actress, one must also understand that the era's views on women's potential were inextricably tied to their sexuality, which in turn was tied to their level of visibility in the public sphere: regardless of race, class or background, it was generally assumed that the more public the woman, the more 'public,' or available, her sexuality, according to historian Maria Elena Buszek. Being sexually fantasized, famous actresses in early 20th-century film were both drawn and photographed and put on posters to be sold for personal entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Carole S. Vance, ed. "Seeking Ectasy on the Battlefield: Danger and Pleasure in Nineteenth-Century Feminist Sexual Thought," in Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality (Boston: Routledge and K. Paul, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[celebrity|celebrities]] who were considered [[sex symbol]]s, one of the most popular early pin-up girls was [[Betty Grable]], whose poster was ubiquitous in the lockers of [[GI (term)|G.I.]]s during [[World War II]].
&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[File:Bernie Dexter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|American pin-up model [[Bernie Dexter]]]]
In Europe, prior to the First World War, the likes of [[Fernande Barrey]] (aka "Miss Fernande"), were arguably the world's first pin-ups as is known in the modern sense. Miss Barrey displayed ample cleavage and full frontal nudity. Her pictures were cherished by soldiers on both sides of the First World War conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dazzledent.tumblr.com/post/9537692783/her-name-was-fernande-barrey-but-she-was-known Dazzledent: Fernande Barrey; tumblr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000322/http://dazzledent.tumblr.com/post/9537692783/her-name-was-fernande-barrey-but-she-was-known |date=2013-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.comcast.net/~kb8gpo/fernande/ Miss Fernande; Comcast.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213236/http://home.comcast.net/~kb8gpo/fernande/ |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other pin-ups were artwork depicting idealized versions of what some thought a particularly beautiful or attractive woman should look like. An early example of the latter type was the [[Gibson girl]], a representation of the [[New Woman]] drawn by [[Charles Dana Gibson]].  "Because the New Woman was symbolic of her new ideas about her sex, it was inevitable that she would also come to symbolize new ideas about sexuality."{{sfnp|Buszek|2006|p=82}}  Unlike the photographed actresses and dancers generations earlier, fantasy gave artists the freedom to draw women in many different ways.{{sfnp|Buszek|2006|p=43}} The 1932 Esquire "men's" magazine featured many drawings and "girlie" cartoons but was most famous for its [[Alberto Vargas|''Vargas girls'']]. Prior to World War II they were praised for their beauty and less focus was on their sexuality. However, during the war, the drawings transformed into women playing dress-up in military drag and drawn in seductive manners, like that of a child playing with a doll.{{sfnp|Buszek|2006|p=209}} The Vargas girls became so popular that from 1942–46, owing to a high volume of military demand, "9 million copies of the magazine-without adverts and free of charge was sent to American troops stationed overseas and in domestic bases."{{sfnp|Buszek|2006|p=210}} The Vargas Girls were adapted as [[nose art]] on many [[World War II]] bomber and fighter aircraft; Generally, they were considered inspiring, and not seen negatively, or as prostitutes, but mostly as inspiring female patriots that were helpful for good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Costello|first=John|title=Virtue Under Fire: How World War II Changed Our social and Sexual Attitudes|year=1985|publisher=Little Brown|location=Boston|isbn=0-316-73968-5|pages=144–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the other well-known artists specializing in the field were [[Earle K. Bergey]], [[Enoch Bolles]], [[Gil Elvgren]], [[George Petty]], [[Rolf Armstrong]], [[Zoë Mozert]], [[Duane Bryers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2385046/Hilda-Fifties-plus-size-pin-rediscovered-year-creator-Duane-Bryers-dies.html|title=How Hilda the forgotten Fifties plus-size pin-up was rediscovered one year after the man who created her died|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nogalesinternational.com/the_bulletin/news/noted-artist-duane-bryers-dies-at/article_971c16f8-aff0-11e1-a9c2-001a4bcf887a.html|title=Noted artist Duane Bryers dies at 100|first=JB Miller The|last=Bulletin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Art Frahm]]. Notable contemporary pin-up artists include [[Olivia De Berardinis]], known for her pin-up art of [[Bettie Page]] and her pieces in ''[[Playboy]]''.

==Feminism and the pin-up==
Many people believe that since its beginnings the pin-up “...has presented women with models for expressing and finding pleasure in their sexual subjectivity”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to [[Joanne Meyerowitz]] in "Women, Cheesecake, and Borderline Material" an article in ''Journal of Women's History'', "As sexual images of women multiplied in the popular culture, women participated actively in constructing arguments to endorse as well as protest them."{{sfnp|Meyerowitz|1996|p=9}}

As early as 1869, women have been supporters and protesters of the pin-up. Female supporters of early pin-up content considered these to be a "positive post-Victorian rejection of bodily shame and a healthy respect for female beauty."{{sfnp|Meyerowitz|1996|p=10}}

Additionally, pin-up allows for women to change the everyday culture. The models “...succeed in the feminist aim of changing the rigid, patriarchal terms”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pin-Up Grrrls: Feminism, Sexuality, Popular Culture|last=Buszek|first=Maria Elena|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has further been argued by some critics that in the early 20th century, these drawings of women helped define certain body images—such as being clean, being healthy, and being wholesome—and were enjoyed by both men and women; as time progressed these images changed from respectable to illicit.{{sfnp|Ross|1989|p=61}}

Conversely, female protesters argued that these images were corrupting societal morality and saw these public sexual displays of women as lowering the standards of [[womanhood]], destroying their dignity, reducing them to mere objects to pleasure men and therefore harmful to both women and young adolescents.{{sfnp|Meyerowitz|1996|p=10}}

Pin-up modeling is a subculture that is invested in promoting positive body images and a love for one's sexuality, “...pin-up would also find ways to… encourage the erotic self-awareness and self expression of real women".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Hair and makeup style  ==

The classic style of the pin-up originates back from the 1940s. Due to the shortages of materials during WWII, this period of makeup is considered the "natural beauty" look.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Classic Beauty: The History of Makeup|last=Hernandez|first=Gabriela|publisher=Schiffer Publishing LTD|year=2017|isbn=0764353004|location=United States|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US was immersed in [[war-time economy]], which put distribution restrictions on consumer goods.&lt;ref&gt;Tassava, Christopher. “The American Economy during World War II”. EH.Net Encyclopedia, edited by Robert Whaples. February 10, 2008. URL &lt;nowiki&gt;http://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-american-economy-during-world-war-ii/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; General rationing was supported; women applied mild amounts of products. Despite the rations, "Women were encouraged to keep buying lipstick and to send letters to the front covered in 'lipstick kisses' to boost the morale of the soldiers."

The products consisted of:

*''"Foundation – A cream base, liquid foundation that matched their natural skin tone,''

"having a sun-kissed glow was popular among white women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hair-and-makeup-artist.com/womens-1940s-makeup/|title=Women's 1940s Makeup: An Overview - Hair and Makeup Artist Handbook|date=2013-01-30|work=Hair and Makeup Artist Handbook|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Compact Powders – used to set the foundation and even the overall complexion.''
*''Eyes and brows – neutral contour on brow bone and lid. Eyebrows were shaped but kept full.''
*''Eyeliner – the wing effect became popular by the1950s.''

&lt;li&gt;''Lashes – extended the barriers of the eye to appear slightly larger.''&lt;/li&gt;

*''Blush – pastel and rose colors applied to the apple of the cheek.''&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li href="#CITEREFAyto2006"&gt;''Lips –'' vibrant red and matte color, applied to look plumper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fashions in Makeup: From Ancient to Modern Times|last=Corson|first=Richard|publisher=Peter Owens Publisher|year=2005|isbn=0720611954|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In the 1950s, the overall look was the red lip was often matched with rosie cheeks. Eyeliner became bold and made a widening effect to make the eye appear larger. Natural eyebrows were embraced as opposed to the thin brows of the 1920s and 30s. 1940s brows were shaped and clean but filled in with a pencil to appear fuller.&lt;ref&gt;“Historial Facts Behind Pin Up Makeup.” ''Historial Facts Behind Pin Up Makeup - RebelCircus.com'', 10 Dec. 2014, www.rebelcircus.com/blog/historical-facts-behind-pin-makeup/full/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipstick "turned into a symbol of resilient femininity in the face of danger"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schaffer|first=Sarah|date=2006|title=Reading Our Lips: The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/10018966/schaffer06.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Food &amp; Drug|volume=|pages=165–225|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was seen as a way to boost morale during the war. The shape of the lip was also iconic of the 1940s. The lips were painted on to look plumper, a broad outline of the lip was added for roundness. This fuller look is known as the "Hunter’s Bow", invented by [[Max Factor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Max Factor and Hollywood: A Glamorous History|last=Thomas|first=Erika|publisher=History Press|year=2016|isbn=1467136107|location=United States|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pin curl is a staple of the pin-up style, "women utilized pin curls for their main hair curling technique".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagehairstyling.com/bobbypinblog/2017/07/demystifying-pin-curls.html|title=Demystifying Pin Curls {{!}} Bobby Pin Blog / Vintage hair and makeup tips and tutorials|website=www.vintagehairstyling.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originating in the 1920s from the "water-waving technique", the hair style of the 1940s consisted of a fuller, gentle curl. The drying technique consists of curling a damp piece of hair, from the end to the root and pin in place. Once the curl is dry, it is brushed through to create the desired soft curl, with a voluminous silhouette.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Victory rolls]] are also a distinctive hairstyle of the pin-up. The Victory roll is curled inward and swept off the face and pinned into place on the top of the head. Soft curls, achieved through the pin curl technique, finish off the look of pin-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.babble.com/beauty/victory-rolls-pin-up-tutorial/|title=Victory Rolls: A Pin-Up Hair Tutorial {{!}} Babble|date=2013-10-10|work=Babble|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a makeup style, the classic pin-up underwent a revival in modern fashion. The red lip and winged eyeliner made a re-emergence in 2010, with singer, [[Katy Perry]] being the most accessible example of modern pin-up makeup.

There is a lack of representation in the media of women of color as pin-up models, even though they were influential to the construction of the style and were just as glamorous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=As/Is|title=Women Of Color Get Transformed Into Pinups|date=2016-06-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiMOXaE8K7U|accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a makeup style, it is simple and sleek makeup, that is noticeable and glamorous.

== Pin-up in the contemporary age ==

Although pin-up modeling is associated with World War II and the 1950s, it has developed more recently into a subculture which can be seen represented in the styles of some celebrities and public figures. [[Pamela Anderson]] was considered the "perennial pin-up" due to decades worth of modeling for [[Hugh Hefner]]'s [[Playboy magazine|Playboy Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|last=Kercher|first=Sophia|title=From Pinup to Muse: Pamela Anderson’s Next Chapter|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 March 2016|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/fashion/from-pinup-to-muse-pamela-andersons-next-chapter.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American singer [[Lana Del Rey]], whose style is comparable to that of the classic pin-up model, has performed a song called "Pin Up Galore".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|title=Pin Up Galore (Live)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgYno78wUIE|via=YouTube|date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beyoncé]] has recorded a song titled "Why Don’t You Love Me"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|title=Beyoncé - Why Don't You Love Me|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QczgvUDskk0|via=YouTube|date=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which pays tribute to the pin-up queen of the 1950s, Bettie Page. The burlesque performer [[Dita Von Teese]] is often referred to as a modern pin-up. She has appeared in a biographical film about Bettie Page, "Bettie Page Reveals All,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bettie Page Reveals All (2012)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1776086/|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Von Teese helps to define pin-up. [[Katy Perry]] makes use of the ideas associated with pin-up modeling, and has included these in music videos and costumes. The [[Victoria's Secret Fashion Show]] can be comparable to burlesque show, whereas their yearly advent calendar can compare to pin-up in general. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/style/victorias-secret-fashion-show-love-advent-weinstein.html|title=Pinups in the Post-Weinstein World|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pin-up modeling subculture has produced magazines and forums dedicated to its community. "Delicious Dolls",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deliciousdollsmagazine.com/about-us/.|title=About Delicious Dolls Magazine &amp; Retro Pinup Models|last=|first=|date=|website=Delicious Dolls Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a magazine that began in 2011 and has both a print and digital version, was described in 2015 as "the most-liked" pin-up magazine in the world. One of the magazine's mission statements is "to promote and showcase retro and modern pin up girls". The magazine supports pin-up-related events throughout the United States and allows anyone to be featured in the magazine as long as they have worked with an approved photographer. Within this subculture there are opportunities to perform in pin-up contests, including one which takes place during the Viva Las Vegas [[rockabilly]] festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vivalasvegas.net/pin-up-contest/.|title=Viva Las Vegas: Pin Up Contest|last=|first=|date=|website=Viva Las Vegas|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the contest is "not one that is based solely on popularity or cosmetic appeal, but one that includes inner beauty as well". Women of "all shapes and sizes" are encouraged to participate, and winners are judged on their biographies, pastimes, and work they do outside of the pin-up hobby. They do not perform, but rather are judged on their authenticity, originality, overall styling presentation, crowd appeal, and stage presence.

== Women of color in pin-up ==
[[File:Baker Banana.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Josephine Baker]] in a banana skirt from the Folies Bergère production ''Un Vent de Folie'', 1927]]
Though [[Marilyn Monroe in popular culture|Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Bettie Page]] are often cited as the classic pin-up, there were many women of color who were also considered to be impactful. In the 1920s two of the most notable Black burlesque dancers were [[Josephine Baker]] and [[Lottie 'The Body' Graves|Lottie Graves]]. Despite the little history on Black burlesque dancers, Josephine Baker and Lottie Graves are a good starting point for evaluating women of color in pin-up. [[Dorothy Dandridge]] and [[Eartha Kitt]] also added to the pin-up style of their time, using their looks, fame, and personal success. African-American pin-up finally had a platform when the magazine, [[Jet (magazine)|Jet]], was created in 1951. Jet supported pin-up as they had a full page feature called, "Beauty of the Week", where African-American women posed in a swimsuits and such. This was intended to showcase the beauty these women possessed as they lived in a world where their skin color was under constant scrutiny. It was not until 1965 that [[Jennifer Jackson (model)|Jennifer Jackson]] became the first African American to be published in ''[[Playboy]]'' as Playmate of the Month. And it was not until 1990 that ''Playboy''’s Playmate of the Year was an African-American woman, [[Renee Tenison|Renee Tennison]]. Historically, women of color in pin-up are still not as common as their white counterparts. However, the recent revival of pin-up style has propelled many women of color today to create and dabble with the classic pin-up look to create their own standards of beauty. In Jim Linderman’s self-published book, "Secret History of the Black Pin Up",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secret History of the Black Pin Up: Women of Color from Pin Up to Porn|last=Linderman|first=Jim|publisher=Dull Tool Dim Bulb Books|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he describes the lives and experiences of African-American pin-up models.

[[File:SKROCKRGRL.jpg|thumb|Issue #10 ''ROCKRGRL'' featuring [[Sleater-Kinney]] ]]
'''''ROCKRGRL''''' was the first national publication for female musicians in the United States. Created by [[Carla DeSantis Black|Carla DeSantis]], the magazine purely focused on women in music and highlighted the artistic diversity of women musicians, often overlooked in mainstream culture. The magazine ran for eleven years, and the strength of its message inspired two pioneering ''ROCKRGRL'' conferences that showcased, celebrated, and addressed the state of the music industry for female artists.

In December 2008, the ROCKRGRL Magazine and conference archives were acquired by [[Schlesinger Library]] at the [[Radcliffe Institute]], Harvard University, to be included in their collection of American Women’s History artifacts.&lt;ref name=Library&gt;Brodeur, Nicole.[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nicolebrodeur/2008674654_brodeur27m.html “ROCKRGRL to Play On at Harvard”] January 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''ROCKRGRL'' magazine==

===History===
''ROCKRGRL'' was started by Carla DeSantis (aka Carla DeSantis Black) in 1994 in [[San Mateo, California]] as part of the [[zine]] movement to provide a [[third-wave feminist]] perspective on women in music.&lt;ref name=Library/&gt;

Commenting on the magazine’s founding, DeSantis recalled, “One issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was about Women Who Rock, and the writer asked everyone what their favorite perfume was, not music. Women were really shut out of music magazines like they didn’t exist.”&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/57424003/Interview-With-Carla-DeSantis-Black "Interview with Carla DeSantis Black"] June 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

''ROCKRGRL'' started out as a 14-page, black-and-white photocopied zine. Its first issue, which hit stands in 1995, featured Gretchen Seager on the cover along with articles about [[that dog.]], [[the Go-Go's]], [[Queen Latifah]], and [[Au Pairs (band)|Au Pairs]]. In 1999, ''ROCKRGRL'' became a full-color glossy bi-monthly magazine.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, Chris.[http://www.nadamucho.com/features/interviews/carla_desantis_-_nada_talks_with_the_rockrgrl.html "Carla DeSantis - Nada Talks With THE ROCKRGRL"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928154123/http://www.nadamucho.com/features/interviews/carla_desantis_-_nada_talks_with_the_rockrgrl.html |date=2007-09-28 }} Nada Mucho.com feature, November 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its lifespan, many famous and influential women appeared on the cover, including [[Justine Frischmann]], [[Shirley Manson]], [[Veruca Salt (band)|Veruca Salt]], [[Tori Amos]], [[Johnette Napolitano]], [[Courtney Love]], [[Kathleen Hanna]], [[Joan Jett]], [[Kat Bjelland]], [[Samantha Maloney]], [[Tegan and Sara]], [[Jessicka]], [[Aimee Mann]], [[Sleater-Kinney]] and [[Marianne Faithfull]].

In the fall of 2005, DeSantis announced that issue number 57 would be the final issue of ''ROCKRGRL''. Although single issues, merchandise and Discoveries CDs could be purchased through the site, they were no longer accepting subscriptions. However, full sets, all 57 issues of ROCKRGRL are now part of the collection at [[The Smithsonian]] in Washington, D.C. and other prestigious colleges and institutions including Harvard, Duke, Cornell, UCLA, University of Washington, Radcliffe Institute, Smith, Oberlin, Rutgers, University of Texas Austin, the New York Public Library.

===Mission===
''ROCKRGRL'' billed itself as, "a real departure from the condescending and patronizing tone found in other "women in music" magazines and web sites. No beauty tips or guilt trips here — just shop talk with fascinating artists."

From its inception, ''ROCKRGRL'' created an atmosphere for women to address music industry sexism head-on. Here is an example from Gretchen Seager of Mary's Danish who appeared on the magazine's first cover:

{{quote|text=I don’t want to be qualified as a female singer. I just want to be a singer. And I don’t think you should be qualified by your gender. That’s always bullshit. And unfortunately, it’s probably not going to change in my lifetime. But I just want to be considered a good lyricist and a good singer, not a “girl” singer or a “girl” lyricist. That’s not relevant. Just evaluate me on my music and my lyrics and I'll be happy.|sign=Gretchen Seager|source=ROCKRGRL Issue #1&lt;ref name=DeSantis&gt;DeSantis, Carla. [http://carladesantisblack.com/2011/05/10/hello-world/ “Gretchen Seager – ROCKRGRL 1995”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522042249/http://carladesantisblack.com/2011/05/10/hello-world/ |date=2011-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
DeSantis recalled:&lt;blockquote&gt;So many of the stories that women were able to tell in ROCKRGRL were stories they weren’t able to tell in any place else. What was different about ROCKRGRL was that a lot of the artists we talked to had cautionary tales. My favorite artists to talk to are the ones who can talk honestly about what happened. They were dropped by their label – why did that happen? Bands broke up, why did that happen? In ROCKRGRL, what I was looking for were career arcs and career stories – how people got started, what their career was like, how it went for them, and what unusual things they did to be successful.&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Circulation===
ROCKRGRL peaked at roughly 20,000 in circulation,&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt; domestic and international, during the years of 2002 and 2003. The magazine was carried by most major retail chains, including [[Virgin Records]], [[Tower Records]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], [[Borders Group|Borders]], and [[Hastings Entertainment]]. ''ROCKRGRL'' could also be found in most [[feminist bookstore]]s. During 2005, the cost for a yearly subscription was $14.95.

DeSantis explained:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I wanted ROCKRGRL to be in the hands of musicians. It was important to me that it found women who were playing music.&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Music conferences==
DeSantis, one of the nation's leading advocates for women in rock,&lt;ref name=Library/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.scrippscollege.edu/press-releases/rockrgrl-editor-tackles-activism-women-in-the-music-industry “Rockrgrl Editor Tackles Activism, Women in the Music Industry”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821062944/http://media.scrippscollege.edu/press-releases/rockrgrl-editor-tackles-activism-women-in-the-music-industry |date=2011-08-21 }} April 4th, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; has also produced two highly successful and critically acclaimed ''ROCKRGRL'' Music Conferences which took place in Seattle in 2000 and 2005 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Ascher, Tizzy. [http://pandomag.com/featurestext/rockrgrl.htm “Vive La Grrrl-Style Revolution! ROCKRGRL Women in Music Conference Makes Good on Its Promise of Change Through Unity”] November 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carla DeSantis 01.jpg|thumb|left]]
Based on the business model of [[SXSW]], the goal of the ROCKRGRL Music Conferences was to give women working in the music industry an opportunity to network and allow those who were just starting out an opportunity to meet those who influenced them. With three nights of music showcases featuring female artists in all styles,&lt;ref&gt;Cleary, Charlotte.[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20001103&amp;slug=4051399 “ROCKRGRL Shakes Seattle]&lt;/ref&gt; a special Woman of Valor&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Margot and Dreilinger, Danielle.[http://www.berklee.edu/news/2007/04/rockrgrl.html “The Pioneers Take a Bow”] April 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; award dinner, two full days of panels, workshops and an artist-friendly trade show, the ROCKRGRL Music Conferences was an opportunity for women working in music to meet, mix and mingle in the city of Seattle.&lt;ref name=Top40&gt;[http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=17513 “Music Legends To Appear at Prestigious Rockrgrl Music Conference @ Seattle”] September 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

“We had 250 female bands perform in clubs and coffeeshops and all kinds of places in downtown Seattle. We had really A-list artists come and speak and perform. And all levels performed, actually. It was eclectic and interesting. It was a really big deal because for me all the people I admired were in the same room,” said DeSantis.&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt;

The diverse line-up of speakers and performers at the ROCKRGRL Music Conference included such musical luminaries as [[Patti Smith]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], Courtney Love, [[Ronnie Spector]] ([[The Ronettes]]), [[Amy Ray]] ([[Indigo Girls]]), [[Ann Wilson]], Johnette Napolitano ([[Concrete Blonde]]), [[Kathy Valentine]] ([[The Go-Go's]]), [[Wanda Jackson]], [[The Gossip]], Jessicka ([[Scarling.]] / [[Jack Off Jill]]), [[Exene Cervenka]], [[Eliza Gilkyson]], [[Rosie Flores]], [[Carol Kaye]], [[Wanda Jackson]] and hundreds more.&lt;ref name=Top40/&gt; During the 2005 conference, keynote speaker [[Patti Smith]] received the Woman of Valor award on the 30th anniversary of the release of her debut album, ''[[Horses (album)|Horses]]''.&lt;ref name=Top40/&gt; The previous recipient of this award was [[Heart (band)|Heart]].&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, Linus. [http://musicdish.com/mag/?id=2340can%20 “Seattle's Rockrgrl Music Conference 2000: Out and About in Caffeine City, Dodging Starbucks and Ducking Low-Flying Fish”] November 15, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 
By 2005, sponsorship for the second ROCKRGRL Music Conference had diminished due emerging economic downturn. Despite this, conference attendance remained high.&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt;

===Daisy Rock Guitars===
[[Daisy Rock Guitars]], a subsidiary of [[Schecter Guitars]], is company that makes guitars for girls exclusively. Its first three prototype models debuted in November 2000 at Seattle’s first ''ROCKRGRL'' Conference.

==Cultural impact==
''ROCKRGRL'' Magazine has been lauded in feature articles in ''[[The LA Times]]'', ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Seventeen (American magazine)|''Seventeen'']], ''[[Jane (magazine)|Jane]]'', ''[[Seattle Times]]'', ''Mercer Island Reporter'', ''[[Village Voice]]'', ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', ''Boston Rock'', ''[[Asbury Park Press]]'', ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'', [[Bitch (magazine)|''Bitch'']], and [[Bust (magazine)|''Bust'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carladesantis.net Carla DeSantis bio], April 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

DeSantis furthers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Women’s voices have been repressed for many years in music. Most of the pop stars we see are singing songs written by men, or written for them. My day, in the 80’s, there were lots of women in music who were writing their own material...What the magazine provided was an opportunity for women who weren’t only singers to find their voices through the magazine. When there aren’t many women doing something, it’s hard to have them as role models. Different ages, different styles of music – they demonstrate that women have a lot to say, and because mainstream music magazines weren’t exploring that, it needed to be explored in some way. The more we see woman musicians, the less of a novelty they will be.&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A ‘’ROCKRGRL Day’’ was held at Musicians’ Institute in Los Angeles in 2003.

'''Shisima''' is a two-player [[abstract strategy game]] from [[Kenya]].  It is related to [[tic-tac-toe]], and even more so to [[Three Men's Morris]], [[Nine Holes]], [[Achi (game)|Achi]], [[Tant Fant]], and [[Dara (game)|Dara]], because pieces are moved on the board to create the 3-in-a-row.  Unlike those other games, Shisima uses an octagonal board.

''Shisima'' means "body of water" in some language spoken in Kenya. The pieces are called ''imbalavali'' which translates to "water bugs" as the pieces move quickly on the board as [[Heteroptera#"Waterbug"|water bugs]] do on the surface of a lake.

== Goal ==

To create a ''3-in-a-row'' of one's pieces running through the middle of the octagonal board.

== Equipment ==

An octagonal board is used.  Lines connect each corner of the octagon to its opposite corner.  The eight lines intersect at the middle of the octagonal board.  There is a total of 9 intersection points or spaces for pieces to be played at.

Each player has 3 pieces.  One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces, however, any two colors or small objects will suffice.

The board is easily drawn on the ground, cardboard, or paper.

== Rules and gameplay ==

1.  Players decide what colors to play, and who will start first.

2.  Each player's three pieces are initially next to each other in a row on the perimeter points of the octagon facing opposite the other player's three pieces which are also next to each other in a row on the perimeter of the octagon.  This leaves three empty spaces left.  One empty space is the middle of the board.  The other two empty spaces separate the two rows of pieces on both sides.

3.  Each piece can move one space at a time following the pattern on the board.  Only one piece can be moved per turn.

4.  Repeating a position three times is a draw.

'''''Soggade Chinni Nayana''''' ({{lang-en|The Young Man is a Charmer|italic=yes}}) is a 2016 Indian [[Telugu language|Telugu-language]] [[Supernatural fiction|supernatural]] [[Drama (genre)|drama film]] directed by Kalyan Krishna Kurasala. In addition to producing the film under his [[Annapurna Studios]] banner, [[Akkineni Nagarjuna]] played dual roles. [[Ramya Krishnan]] and [[Lavanya Tripathi]] were the film's female leads. [[Nassar]], [[Pithamagan Mahadevan]], [[Sampath Raj]] and [[Brahmanandam]] played key supporting roles.

Written by [[Ram Mohan P]], ''Soggade Chinni Nayana'' revolves around the soul of Bangarraju, a flirtatious [[zamindar]] whom [[Yama]] (the god of the underworld) sends back to earth to reconcile his son (Ram "Ramu" Mohan) and his wife Seetha; they are on the brink of divorce. In the process, he learns about his death and its connection with a local [[Shiva]] temple.

[[P. S. Vinod]] and Siddhardh Ramaswami provided the cinematography, and [[Anup Rubens]] composed the film's soundtrack and background score. [[Prawin Pudi]] edited the film. [[Principal photography]] for the film began on 19 November 2014 after it was launched in [[Hyderabad]], and wrapped on 4 October 2015. Most of the film was shot in and around [[Rajahmundry]] and [[Mysore]].

Produced on a budget of {{INR}}150{{ndash}}200 million, ''Soggade Chinni Nayana'' was released worldwide on 15 January 2016 during the [[Makar Sankranti]] festival season in 800-900 screens. It received positive reviews from critics and was commercially successful, earning {{INR}}750&amp;nbsp;million globally. The film was remade in [[Kannada]] as ''[[Upendra Matte Baa]]'' (2017), starring [[Upendra (actor)|Upendra]], [[Prema (actress)|Prema]] and [[Sruthi Hariharan]] in the lead roles.

== Plot ==
Ram "Ramu" Mohan is a socially-inept [[cardiologist]] practicing in the [[United States]]. His wife, Seetha, feels lonely since Ramu pays very little attention to her because of his work. They decide to divorce and leave for Sivapuram, [[Rajahmundry]], where Ramu's mother Satyabhama lives. Satyabhama, shocked to learn that Ramu and Seetha are divorcing, shouts at a portrait of her deceased husband Bangarraju (a benevolent, flirtatious zamindar who died nearly 30 years ago in an accident).

Bangarraju's soul is in [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]], where he continues to flirt. [[Yama]], at [[Shiva]]'s command, sends him back to earth because there is a mission only he can fulfil. Bangarraju, who can be seen and heard only by Satyabhama, tries to solve his family's problems. After several unsuccessful attempts, Bangarraju possesses Ramu's body on his birthday. He meets Ramu's young female cousins, and invites them to his home. On his way back Ramu meets Suri, a frightened drunk who runs away as Ramu and Bangarraju look identical. To free himself from guilt, Suri later admits that he murdered Bangarraju with a lorry after he was bribed. Before he can disclose more details, Suri dies in an accident and Bangarraju learns that his family is in danger. Ramu spends quality time with his cousins, making Seetha jealous.

Bangarraju is confronted by Satyabhama, who is unaware of recent events. He suggests that she help Seetha impress Ramu. At Satyabhama's suggestion, Ramu and Seetha go to a theatre to watch a film. When she is taunted, Ramu (possessed by Bangarraju) overpowers her tormenters. Seetha is pleasantly surprised, since Ramu failed to confront the same group earlier in a similar situation. The couple slowly grow closer, and Seetha realises that Ramu does love her. Bangarraju learns from Athmanandam, a [[Godman (India)|godman]] who can communicate with souls, that his uncle Rudraraju masterminded his murder. Rudraraju and his cousin, Veerababu, wanted to steal jewellery from a 1,000-year old temple to [[Shiva]]. They murdered Bangarraju, bribing Suri to silence him.

After Rudraraju's son dies when he is bitten by a divine snake, a [[tantra|tantrik]] warns that only Bangarraju's descendants can open the lock; others would be killed by the snake. The tantrik captures Bangarraju's soul and gives a few threads to Sampath, Rudraraju's grandson, telling him to tie them to the hands of every member of Bangarraju's family to keep his soul from communicating with them. After Sampath and the others leave, the snake kills the tantrik and saves Bangarraju's soul.

Bangarraju reaches the temple, where Satyabhama can neither see nor hear him and he cannot possess Ramu. Rudraraju and Sampath attack Ramu and Seetha after the jewellery is removed from the treasury. Rudraraju tells his henchmen to put the couple in a car with the jewellery, which will make the villagers think that they are the thieves. The thread to Ramu's hand comes loose, and Bangarraju possesses him. Bangarraju fights them and retrieves the jewellery before leaving Ramu, who operates on an injured Seetha in a nearby hospital. Satyabhama removes the thread and can see Bangarraju. Ramu and Seetha reconcile, and Yama orders Bangarraju to come back in accordance with Shiva's instructions. When Satyabhama begs Bangarraju to stay, Yama gives him a chance to wipe away her tears. He asks her to keep smiling and live happily for his sake, and returns to Naraka.

During the production of ''[[Manam (film)|Manam]]'' (2014), producer and lead actor [[Akkineni Nagarjuna]] liked the portions which were set against a village backdrop. He developed an interest in making a film based on Indian village life, feeling that audiences would see a "new, yet traditional lifestyle, something fresh and interesting".&lt;ref name="Nagarjuna int DNA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/interview-soggade-chinni-nayana-will-see-me-explore-a-village-subject-after-a-decade-says-nagarjuna-2165270 |title='Soggade Chinni Nayana' will see me explore a village subject after a decade, says Nagarjuna |work=Daily News and Analysis |date=13 January 2016 |accessdate=23 September 2016 |last=Srinivasan |first=Latha |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923143934/http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/interview-soggade-chinni-nayana-will-see-me-explore-a-village-subject-after-a-decade-says-nagarjuna-2165270 |archivedate=23 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After sketching the basic idea, [[Ram Mohan P]] approached Virinchi Varma to direct the film; Mohan produced Varma's directorial debut, ''[[Uyyala Jampala]]'' (2013).

Kurasala was confirmed as director, marking his directorial debut in Telugu cinema.&lt;ref name="Nagarjuna int TH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/i-want-to-make-good-fun-films-actor-nagarjuna/article8085690.ece |title=‘I want to make good, fun films’ |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=9 January 2016 |accessdate=23 September 2016 |last=Dundoo |first=Sangeetha Devi |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923164747/http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/i-want-to-make-good-fun-films-actor-nagarjuna/article8085690.ece |archivedate=23 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagarjuna approved the inclusion of supernatural elements, such as the ghost of Bangarraju and the divine snake guarding his family, on the condition that they be positive and not frightening.&lt;ref name="Nagarjuna int DNA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nagarjuna int TH"/&gt;

He played two roles: Bangarraju, a flirtatious zamindar, and his son Ramu (a socially-inept doctor, born the day after Bangarraju's death).

=== Reception ===

According to Karthik Srinivasan of ''[[The Hindu]]'', the [[Hook (music)|hook]] of "Dikka Dikka Dum Dum" resembles one written by [[A. R. Rahman]] for the Tamil song "Kaatre En Vasal" from ''[[Rhythm (2000 film)|Rhythm]]'' (2000): ''"Thulli varum kaatre, thulli varun kaatre, thaaimozhi pesu"''. Srinivasan called its melody "heady, raucous and very rhythmic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/hitman-songs-you-must-listen-to-this-week/article8146169.ece |title=Hitman: Songs you must listen to this week |work=The Hindu |date=24 January 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2016 |last=Srinivasan |first=Karthik |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924095035/http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/hitman-songs-you-must-listen-to-this-week/article8146169.ece |archivedate=24 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sangeetha Devi Dundoo from ''The Hindu'' wrote that Rubens' music complemented the film's rural backdrop.&lt;ref name="TH review"/&gt; [[Sify]] called Rubens' music one of the film's biggest strengths, which "perfectly gelled with the rustic storyline".&lt;ref name="Sify Review"/&gt;

'''''SpurguX''''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[humour|humorous]] [[roguelike]] [[video game]] developed by Petri Niska in 1987. It was originally developed for [[MS-DOS]] and has later been ported to [[Unix]].

According to the manual, ''SpurguX'' is an "adventure game based on real life, where the [[anti-hero]] progresses through city districts looking for a bottle of [[brandy]], which is rumoured to be located on stage 50, accompanied only by a great thirst". The player advances among the roguelike tradition from one stage to the next accumulating equipment, killing "monsters" and trying to survive. One of the most common causes of death is [[hangover]], which occurs when the player's blood alcohol level drops too low. Because of this, the player must constantly maintain the character's [[alcohol intoxication]] level by acquiring and drinking [[alcoholic beverage]]s. Most stages have points that have to be collected before advancing to the next stage, as well as a random collection of non-player characters, items and buildings.

==Characters==
* &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;: The player.
* &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;: A [[policeman]]. The police start to chase the player if he/she does something illegal.
* &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;: A grandmother. Grandmothers can be killed fairly easily, but this causes the police to attack the player. Killing a grandmother yields money, which can be used for example to buy alcohol.
* &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;: A point fairy. Bounces randomly around the stage eating the points needed for completion of the stage. Hitting the point fairy causes a point to be recreated in a random place.
* &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;: A [[negro]].
* &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;: A [[Aalto University|University of Technology]] student. Forcibly sells a copy of ''[[Äpy]]'' magazine to the player.
* &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;: A [[punk subculture|punk]]. Punks appear in gangs, and killing the gang leader (&lt;code&gt;Ñ&lt;/code&gt;) awards a set of chains. The chains are among the most powerful weapons in the game.
* &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;: Kake. Asks the player to give him [[beer]].
* &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;: A [[pickpocket]].
* &lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt;: A [[homosexuality|gay]] man.

'''''Ssireum''''' ([[Hangul]]: 씨름) or '''Korean wrestling''' is a [[folk wrestling]] style and  traditional [[national sport]] of [[Korea]] since the fourth century.

In the modern form each contestant wears a belt (satba) that wraps around the waist and the thigh. The competition employs a series of techniques, which inflict little harm or injury to the opponent: opponents lock on to each other's belt, and one achieves victory by bringing any part of the opponent's body above the knee to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ynucc.yeungnam.ac.kr/~ssi/Introduction/What_is_Ssireum_/what_is_ssireum_.html What is Ssireum?] ''Korean Ssireum Research Institute''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Historically, with the introduction of Chinese culture, there have been other terms for "wrestling" in Korean used alongside ''ssireum'', such  as ''gakjeo'' (각저:角抵), ''gakhui'' (각희:角戱), ''gakryeok'' (각력:角力), ''gakji'' (각지:角支), ''chiuhui'' (치우희:蚩尤戱), ''sangbak'' (상박:相撲), ''jaenggyo'' (쟁교:爭交).&lt;ref&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://www.yonginss.com/data/data_view.php?idx=7&amp;page=1&amp;search_txt=&amp;search_sel= Origin and definition of ssireum 씨름의 정의] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319015817/http://www.yonginss.com/data/data_view.php?idx=7&amp;page=1&amp;search_txt=&amp;search_sel= |date=2009-03-19 }} Yongin University Ssireum Research Center&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Gak'' (각:角), a commonly used prefix, seems to have originated from the combative act performed by horned animals such as oxen when competing against one another for the superiority of physical strength.

== History ==
The earliest evidence of ''ssireum'', or "Korean wrestling", dates back to the Goguryeo period. Originally used in military applications, ''ssireum'' became a popular pastime of the people, including many Korean kings, during the Goryeo and Joseon periods.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Thomas A.|last2=Svinth|first2=Joseph R.|title=Martial Arts of the World: An Encyclopedia of History and Innovation [2 volumes]: An Encyclopedia of History and Innovation|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598842449|pages=192–193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P-Nv_LUi6KgC&amp;pg=PA192#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=en|date=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Goguryeo-Gakjeochong-Ssireumdo-01.jpg|thumb|200px|Ssireum depicted on Goguryeo mural]]

In traditional life, Ssireum was a popular activity on the Korean holiday of [[Dano (Korean festival)|Dano]], the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, and tournaments are held in the summer and autumn.  Ssireum competitions were also held on other days such as the Third Day of the Third Moon, the Eighth day of the Fourth Moon, Buddhist All Souls’ Day, etc.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.  The traditional prize for winning a tournament was an ox, a valuable commodity in agriculturally-oriented society, which symbolized the strength of the contestant{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

In the 20th century, ''ssireum'' became a nationally televised sport in South Korea.&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt;
The first modern competition was held in 1912 at  the Dansongsa theater in Seoul{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. 
Korean wrestling has been referred to as ''ssireum'' since the 1920s{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. The  Pan Chosun Ssireum Federation was founded in 1927. Since 1947 the competition organised by the Ssireum Federation has been called the National Ssireum Championship Contest. Weight classes were introduced at  the 12th National Ssireum Championship Contest, and revised in 1967{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. There are two traditional styles of Ssireum: a "right sided" style predominant in parts of the Gyunggi province, and Honam province of southern Korea, and a "left side" style favoured in  Hamgyung province, Gyungsang province and Choonchong province. The difference depended on the way the ''satba'' was fastened{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. In 1994, the Korean Ssireum federation, chaired by Hong sup Kim, proposed the unification of Ssireum in a single style and left sided Ssireum was adopted as the official style to be used by all competitors.

=== World cultural heritage status ===
On November 26, 2018, the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of [[Unesco]] inscribed traditional Korean wrestling, (ssirum/ssireum) following an unprecedented joint application by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/news/traditional-korean-wrestling-listed-intangible-cultural-heritage-following-unprecedented-merged&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method of competition ==
[[File:Korea-2008 Gyeongju Citizens' Athletics Festival-Ssireum-02.jpg|thumb|A ssrireum match at Gyeongju Citizens' Athletics Festival in 2008]]
[[File:Korea-2008 Gyeongju Citizens' Athletics Festival-Ssireum-01.jpg|thumb|A ssrireum match at Gyeongju Citizens' Athletics Festival in 2008]]
Ssireum is conducted within a circular ring, measuring approximately 7 meters in diameter, which is covered with mounded sand. The two contestants begin the match by kneeling on the sand in a grappling position (''baro japki''), each grabbing a belt—known as a ''satba'' (샅바)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Connor|first=Mary E.|title=The Koreas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j2gYgXGENM0C&amp;pg=PA325|accessdate=16 January 2012|date=2009-06-30|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-160-2|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;—which is wrapped around his opponent's waist and thigh. The wrestlers then rise while retaining their hold on the other's 'satba.' The match is awarded to the wrestler who forces the other contestant to touch the ground with any part of his body at knee level or higher. Unlike [[sumo]], pushing your opponent outside of the ring does not warrant a win, just a restart. Normally, professional ssireum is contested in a best-out-of-three style match.

There are 3 judges, a chief referee and three sub referees. The chief judge is positioned inside the ring, whereas the sub referees are located on the outside of the ring, one to the right and others to the left. If an unfair judgment is called or the chief referee is unable to render a decision, the sub referees can request a revocation of the decision or a rematch. In addition, they can recommend the cessation of the match when an injury occurs. The referees’ decisions throughout the competition are absolute and held in the highest regard, meaning that athletes cannot challenge any judgments declared during the match.

Today there are also women Ssireum wrestlers. Women wrestle only among themselves but follow the same rules (except that men are topless whereas women wear tops).

There are 4 weight classes in professional wrestling: flyweight ([[Taebaeksan|Taebaek]], 75 kg), lightweight ([[Kumgangsan|Geumgang]], 90 kg), middleweight ([[Hallasan|Halla]], 105 kg), and heavyweight ([[Baekdusan|Baekdu]], under 160 kg), named after the four famous peaks in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Korean Wrestle Mania |url=https://tripologist.com/asia/korean-wrestle-mania-the-2012-seollal-ssireum-tournament/ |website=Tripologist |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally Ssireum was contested with the top portion of the trousers rolled down to provide grip. The use of "satba" was invented with the birth of professional Ssireum in the mid-20th century. There is a movement to restore this traditional method of grip, in the spirit of maintaining its cultural and traditional roots, but it has met with some resistance as the use of "satba" has become entrenched in the modern form.

The professional league is dwindling in popularity and many wrestlers have turned their attention to [[mixed martial arts]] fighting, even though Ssireum involves no striking or submissions of any kind, as a means of making a living. [[Choi Hong-man]], former champion of Ssireum, is enjoying notable success in the [[K-1]] scene. Unfortunately, the future of professional Ssireum remains bleak, with only one team remaining. However, it can also be argued that Ssireum is beginning to undergo global expansion as a popular martial arts sport, alongside [[taekwondo]] and [[hapkido]].

It is important to note the differences between Ssireum and sumo. Ssireum has remained largely a national/traditional sport. Physical hits such as slaps and blows are not permitted in Ssireum, though they are in sumo. In both sports, the competitors are often quite large, though Korean wrestlers tend to be leaner. However, size does not guarantee success in either sport. Although both sports are quite similar, they differ in characteristics as well as values.

The national governing body of the sport in Korea, Korean Ssireum Organization, has made a claim that Ssireum is characterized as a "peaceful competition focusing on harmony and unison", reflecting the "philosophical outlook of the Korean Race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssirum.or.kr/korea/kor_ssireum01_eng.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131084423/http://www.ssirum.or.kr/korea/kor_ssireum01_eng.php |archivedate=2008-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{UStheater}}
'''Theater in the United States''' is part of the European theatrical tradition that dates back to [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek theatre]] and is heavily influenced by the [[Theatre of the United Kingdom|British theatre]]. The central hub of the US theater scene is [[New York City]], with its divisions of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[Off-Broadway]], and [[Off-Off-Broadway]]. Many movie and television stars got their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York, many cities have professional [[Regional theater in the United States|regional or resident theater companies]] that produce their own seasons, with some works being produced regionally with hopes of eventually moving to New York. US theater also has an active [[community theatre]] culture, which relies mainly on local volunteers who may not be actively pursuing a theatrical career.

==Early history==
{{US culture}}
[[File:Edwin Forrest.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edwin Forrest]], a popular early American actor]]
Before the first English colony was established in 1607, there were Spanish dramas and Native American tribes that performed theatrical events.&lt;ref name= "World Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: The Americas |last= |first= |authorlink= |authors= |editor1-first=Don |editor1-last=Rubin |editor1-link= |editor2-first=Carlos |editor2-last=Solórzano |editor2-link=Carlos Solórzano |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York City |isbn=0-415-05929-1 |page=394 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a theater was built in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] in 1716, and the original [[Dock Street Theatre]] opened in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in 1736, the birth of professional theater in America may have begun when [[Lewis Hallam]] arrived with his theatrical company in Williamsburg in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Arthur Hornblow|title=The Coming of the Hallams|url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/american/hornblow03.html|website=Theatrehistory.com|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Company|accessdate=December 15, 2016|location=Philadelphia|pages=66–87|date=1919|quote=A History of the Theatre in America, Vol. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis and his brother [[William Hallam (theatre manager)|William]], who arrived in 1754, were the first to organize a complete company of actors in Europe and bring them to the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]]. They brought a repertoire of plays popular in London at the time, including ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[The Recruiting Officer]]'', and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' was their first performance, shown initially on September 15, 1752.&lt;ref name="theatrehistory.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/american/hornblow01.html|title=The First American Theatre|website=Theatrehistory.com|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encountering opposition from religious organizations, Hallam and his company left for [[Jamaica]] in 1754 or 1755.{{Citation needed|reason=date: September 14, 2008|date=September 2008}} Soon after, [[Lewis Hallam, Jr.]], founded the American Company, opened a theater in New York, and presented the first professionally mounted American play—''[[The Prince of Parthia]]'', by [[Thomas Godfrey (writer)|Thomas Godfrey]]—in 1767.&lt;ref&gt;''The Prince of Parthia: A Tragedy''  By Thomas Godfrey, reprinted 1917 by Little, Brown.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, laws forbidding the performance of plays were passed in [[Massachusetts]] in 1750, in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1759, and in [[Rhode Island]] in 1761, and plays were banned in most states during the [[American Revolutionary War]] at the urging of the [[Continental Congress]].&lt;ref name="theatrehistory.com"/&gt; In 1794, president of [[Yale College]], [[Timothy Dwight IV]], in his "Essay on the Stage", declared that "to indulge a taste for playgoing means nothing more or less than the loss of that most valuable treasure: the immortal soul."{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In spite of such laws, however, a few writers tried their hand at playwriting. Most likely, the first plays written in America were by European-born authors—we know of original plays being written by Spaniards, Frenchmen and Englishmen dating back as early as 1567—although no plays were printed in America until [[Robert Hunter (governor)|Robert Hunter's]] ''[[Androboros]]'' in 1714. Still, in the early years, most of the plays produced came from Europe; only with Godfrey's ''The Prince of Parthia'' in 1767 do we get a professionally produced play written by an American, although it was a last-minute substitute for Thomas Forrest's comic opera ''[[The Disappointment|The Disappointment; or, The Force of Credulity]]'', and although the first play to treat American themes seriously, ''Ponteach; or, the Savages of America'' by [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Robert Rogers]], had been published in London a year earlier.&lt;ref name=Meserve&gt;Meserve, Walter J. ''An Outline History of American Drama,'' New York: Feedback/Prospero, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  'Cato', a play about revolution, was performed for George Washington and his troops at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777–1778.

The [[American Revolution|Revolutionary period]] was a boost for dramatists, for whom the political debates were fertile ground for both satire, as seen in the works of [[Mercy Otis Warren]] and Colonel Robert Munford, and for plays about heroism, as in the works of [[Hugh Henry Brackenridge]]. The post-war period saw the birth of American social comedy in [[Royall Tyler]]'s ''[[The Contrast (play)|The Contrast]]'', which established a much-imitated version of the "Yankee" character, here named "Jonathan". But there were no professional dramatists until [[William Dunlap]], whose work as playwright, translator, manager and theater historian has earned him the title of "Father of American Drama"; in addition to translating the plays of [[August von Kotzebue]] and French melodramas, Dunlap wrote plays in a variety of styles, of which ''[[André (play)|André]]'' and ''[[The Father (Dunlap play)|The Father; or, American Shandyism]]'' are his best.&lt;ref name=Meserve/&gt;

==The 19th century==
===Pre-war theater===
At 825 Walnut Street in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, is the [[Walnut Street Theatre]], or, "The Walnut."  Founded in 1809 by the [[Circus of Pepin and Breschard]], "The Walnut" is the oldest theater in America. The Walnut's first theatrical production, ''The Rivals'', was staged in 1812. In attendance were President [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the [[Marquis de Lafayette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walnutstreettheatre.org|title=Walnut Street Theatre – Philadelphia, PA – Official Website|website=Walnutstreettheatre.org|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provincial theaters frequently lacked heat and minimal [[theatrical property]] ("props") and [[theatrical scenery|scenery]]. Apace with the country's [[westward expansion]], some entrepreneurs operated floating theaters on [[barge]]s or [[riverboat]]s that would travel from town to town. A large town could afford a long "run"—or period of time during which a touring company would stage consecutive multiple performances—of a production, and in 1841, a single play was shown in New York City for an unprecedented three weeks.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

[[File:John Drew as Petruchio.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Drew, Jr.|John Drew]], a famous American actor, playing the part of Petruchio from ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''.]]

[[William Shakespeare]]'s works were commonly performed. American plays of the period were mostly [[melodrama]]s, a famous example of which was ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', adapted by [[George Aiken]], from the novel of the same name by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].

In 1821, William Henry Brown established the [[African Grove|African Grove Theatre]] in New York City. It was the third attempt to have an African-American theater, but this was the most successful of them all. The company put on not only Shakespeare, but also staged the first play written by an African-American, ''[[The Drama of King Shotaway]]''. The theater was shut down in 1823.&lt;ref name="World Encyclopedia, p. 402"&gt;World Encyclopedia, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; African-American theater was relatively dormant, except for the 1858 play ''The Escape; or, A Leap for Freedom'' by [[William Wells Brown]], who was an ex-slave. African-American works would not be regarded again until the 1920s [[Harlem Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="World Encyclopedia, p. 402"/&gt;

A popular form of theater during this time was the [[minstrel show]], which featured white (and sometimes, especially after the Civil War, [[black people|black]]) actors dressed in "[[blackface]] (painting one's face, etc. with dark makeup to imitate the coloring of an [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] or African American)." The players entertained the audience using comic skits, parodies of popular plays and musicals, and general buffoonery and slapstick comedy, all with heavy utilization of [[racial stereotype|racial stereotyping]] and [[racism|racist]] themes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Throughout the 19th century, theater culture was associated with [[hedonism]] and even violence, and actors (especially women), were looked upon as little better than prostitutes. [[Jessie Bond]] wrote that by the middle of the 19th century, "The stage was at a low ebb, Elizabethan glories and Georgian artificialities had alike faded into the past, stilted tragedy and vulgar farce were all the would-be playgoer had to choose from, and the theatre had become a place of evil repute".&lt;ref name=Bond&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/intro.html|title=The Life and Reminiscences of Jessie Bond – Introduction|website=math.boisestate.edu|accessdate=October 4, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421204843/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/bond/intro.html|archivedate=April 21, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 15, 1865, less than a week after the end of the [[United States Civil War]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], while watching [[Our American Cousin|a play]] at [[Ford's Theater]] in Washington, D.C., [[Abraham Lincoln#Assassination|was assassinated]] by a nationally popular stage-actor of the period, [[John Wilkes Booth]].

[[Victorian burlesque]], a form of bawdy comic theater mocking high art and culture, was imported from England about 1860 and in America became a form of [[farce]] in which females in male roles mocked the politics and culture of the day. Criticized for its sexuality and outspokenness, this form of entertainment was hounded off the "legitimate stage" and found itself relegated to saloons and [[Bar (establishment)|barrooms]].{{Citation needed|reason=date: September 14, 2008|date=September 2008}} The female producers, such as [[Lydia Thompson]] were replaced by their male counterparts, who toned down the politics and played up the sexuality, until the [[American burlesque|burlesque shows]] eventually became little more than pretty girls in skimpy clothing singing songs, while male comedians told raunchy jokes.

The drama of the pre-war period tended to be a derivative in form, imitating European melodramas and romantic tragedies, but native in content, appealing to popular nationalism by dramatizing current events and portraying American heroism. But playwrights were limited by a set of factors, including the need for plays to be profitable, the middle-brow tastes of American theater-goers, and the lack of copyright protection and compensation for playwrights. During this time, the best strategy for a dramatist was to become an actor and/or a manager, after the model of [[John Howard Payne]], [[Dion Boucicault]] and [[John Brougham]]. This period saw the popularity of certain native character types, especially the "Yankee", the "Negro" and the "Indian", exemplified by the characters of [[Brother Jonathan|Jonathan]], [[Sambo (racial term)|Sambo]] and [[Metamora; or, The Last of the Wampanoags|Metamora]]. Meanwhile, increased immigration brought a number of plays about the Irish and Germans, which often dovetailed with concerns over temperance and Roman Catholic. This period also saw plays about American expansion to the West (including plays about Mormonism) and about women's rights. Among the best plays of the period are [[James Nelson Barker]]'s ''Superstition; or, the Fanatic Father'', [[Anna Cora Mowatt]]'s ''Fashion; or, Life in New York'', [[Nathaniel Bannister]]'s ''[[Putnam, the Iron Son of '76]]'', [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''[[The Octoroon|The Octoroon; or, Life in Louisiana]]'', and [[Cornelius Mathews]]'s ''Witchcraft; or, the Martyrs of Salem''. At the same time, America had created new dramatic forms in the [[Tom Shows]], the [[showboat|showboat theater]] and the [[minstrel show]].&lt;ref name=Meserve/&gt;

===Post-war theater===
In the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|postbellum]] North, theater flourished as a post-war boom allowed longer and more-frequent productions. The advent of American rail transport allowed production companies, its actors, and large, elaborate sets to travel easily between towns, which made permanent theaters in small towns feasible. The invention and practical application of [[electric light]]ing also led to changes to and improvements of scenery styles and the designing of theater interiors and seating areas.

[[File:Howard and Griffin wench.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Minstrel show performers Rollin Howard (in female costume) and George Griffin, c. 1855.]]

In 1896, [[Charles Frohman]], [[Al Hayman]], [[Abe Erlanger]], [[Marcus Klaw|Mark Klaw]], Samuel F. Flenderson, and [[J. Fred Zimmerman, Sr.]] formed the [[Theatrical Syndicate]], which established systemized [[Talent agent|booking]] networks throughout the United States, and created a management monopoly that controlled every aspect of contracts and bookings until the turn of the 20th century, when the [[Shubert brothers]] founded rival agency, [[The Shubert Organization]].

For playwrights, the period after the War brought more financial reward and aesthetic respect (including professional criticism) than was available earlier. In terms of form, spectacles, melodramas and farces remained popular, but poetic drama and romanticism almost died out completely due to the new emphasis upon realism, which was adopted by serious drama, melodrama and comedy alike. This realism was not quite the European realism of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', but a combination of scenic realism (e.g., the "[[David Belasco|Belasco]] Method") with a less romantic view of life that accompanied the cultural turmoil of the period. The most ambitious effort towards realism during this period came from [[James Herne]], who was influenced by the ideas of Ibsen, [[Thomas Hardy|Hardy]] and [[Émile Zola|Zola]] regarding realism, truth, and literary quality; his most important achievement, ''[[Margaret Fleming]]'', enacts the principles he expounded in his essay "Art for Truth's Sake in the Drama". Although ''Fleming'' did not appeal to audiences—critics and audiences felt it dwelt too much on unseemly topics and included improper scenes, such as Margaret nursing her husband's bastard child onstage—other forms of dramatic realism were becoming more popular in melodrama (e.g., [[Augustin Daly]]'s ''[[Under the Gaslight]]'') and in [[American literary regionalism|local color]] plays ([[Bronson Howard]]'s ''Shenandoah''). Other key dramatists during this period are [[David Belasco]], [[Steele MacKaye]], [[William Dean Howells]], [[Dion Boucicault]], and [[Clyde Fitch]].&lt;ref name=Meserve/&gt;

==The 20th century==
[[Vaudeville]] was common in the late 19th and early 20th century, and is notable for heavily influencing early film, radio, and television productions in the country. (This was born from an earlier American practice of having singers and novelty acts perform between acts in a standard play.) [[George Burns]] was a very long-lived American comedian who started out in the vaudeville community, but went on to enjoy a career running until the 1990s.

Some vaudeville theaters built between about 1900 and 1920 managed to survive as well, though many went through periods of alternate use, most often as movie theaters until the second half of the century saw many urban populations decline and [[movie theater|multiplexes]] built in the suburbs. Since that time, a number have been restored to original or nearly-original condition and attract new audiences nearly one hundred years later.

By the beginning of the 20th century, legitimate 1752 (non-vaudeville) theater had become decidedly more sophisticated in the United States, as it had in Europe. The stars of this era, such as [[Ethel Barrymore]] and [[John Barrymore]], were often seen as even more important than the show itself. The advance of motion pictures also led to many changes in theater. The popularity of musicals may have been due in part to the fact the [[Silent film|early films]] had no sound, and could thus not compete, until ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' of 1927, which combined both talking and music in a moving picture. More complex and sophisticated dramas bloomed in this time period, and acting styles became more subdued. Even by 1915, actors were being lured away from theater and to the [[silver screen]], and vaudeville was beginning to face stiff competition.

While [[revue]]s consisting of mostly unconnected songs, sketches, comedy routines, and dancing girls ([[Ziegfeld girl]]s) dominated for the first 20 years of the 20th century, musical theater would eventually develop beyond this. One of the first major steps was ''[[Show Boat]]'', with music by [[Jerome Kern]] and lyrics by [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Oscar Hammerstein]]. It featured songs and non-musical scenes which were integrated to develop the show's plot. The next great step forward was ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', with lyrics by Hammerstein and music by [[Richard Rodgers]]. Its "dream ballets" used dance to carry forward the plot and develop the characters.

Amateur performing groups have always had a place alongside professional acting companies. The Amateur Comedy Club, Inc. was founded in New York City on April 18, 1884. It was organized by seven gentlemen who broke away from the Madison Square Dramatic Organization, a socially prominent company presided over by Mrs. James Brown Potter and [[David Belasco]]. The ACC staged its first performance on February 13, 1885. It has performed continuously ever since, making it the oldest, continuously performing theatrical society in the United States. Prominent New Yorkers who have been members of the ACC include Theodore, Frederick and John Steinway of the piano manufacturing family; Gordon Grant, the marine artist; Christopher La Farge, the architect; Van H. Cartmell, the publisher; [[Albert Sterner]], the painter; and Edward Fales Coward, the theater critic and playwright. [[Elsie De Wolfe]], Lady Mendl, later famous as the world's first professional interior decorator, acted in Club productions in the early years of the 20th Century, as did [[Hope Williams]], and Julie Harris in the 1940s.

Early 20th century theater was dominated by the [[Barrymore acting family|Barrymores]]—[[Ethel Barrymore]], [[John Barrymore]], and [[Lionel Barrymore]]. Other greats included [[Laurette Taylor]], [[Jeanne Eagels]], and [[Eva Le Gallienne]].
The massive social change that went on during the [[Great Depression]] also had an effect on theater in the United States. Plays took on social roles, identifying with immigrants and the unemployed. The [[Federal Theatre Project]], a [[New Deal]] program set up by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], helped to promote theater and provide jobs for actors. The program staged many elaborate and controversial plays such as ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' by [[Sinclair Lewis]] and ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]'' by [[Marc Blitzstein]]. By contrast, the legendary producer [[Brock Pemberton]] (founder of the [[Tony Awards]]) was among those who felt that it was more than ever a time for comic entertainment, in order to provide an escape from the prevailing harsh social conditions: typical of his productions was [[Lawrence Riley]]'s comedy ''[[Personal Appearance]]'' (1934), whose success on Broadway (501 performances) vindicated Pemberton.

The years between the World Wars were years of extremes. [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s plays were the high point for serious dramatic plays leading up to the outbreak of war in Europe. ''[[Beyond the Horizon (play)|Beyond the Horizon]]'' (1920), for which he won his first Pulitzer Prize; he later won Pulitzers for ''[[Anna Christie]]'' (1922) and ''[[Strange Interlude]]'' (1928) as well as the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. [[Alfred Lunt]] and [[Lynn Fontanne]] remained a popular acting couple in the 1930s.

1940 proved to be a pivotal year for African-American theater. [[Frederick O'Neal]] and Abram Hill founded ANT, or the [[American Negro Theater]], the most renowned African-American theater group of the 1940s. Their stage was small and located in the basement of a library in Harlem, and most of the shows were attended and written by African-Americans. Some shows include Theodore Browne's ''Natural Man'' (1941), Abram Hill's ''Walk Hard'' (1944), and [[Owen Dodson]]'s ''Garden of Time'' (1945). Many famous actors received their training at ANT, including [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Alice Childress|Alice]] and [[Alvin Childress]], Osceola Archer, [[Ruby Dee]], [[Earle Hyman]], [[Hilda Simms]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;World Encyclopedia, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

Mid-20th century theater saw a wealth of Great Leading Ladies, including [[Helen Hayes]], [[Katherine Cornell]], [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Judith Anderson]], and [[Ruth Gordon]]. Musical theater saw stars such as [[Ethel Merman]], [[Beatrice Lillie]], [[Mary Martin]], and [[Gertrude Lawrence]].

===Post World War II theater===
After World War II, American theater came into its own. Several American playwrights, such as [[Arthur Miller]] and [[Tennessee Williams]], became world-renowned.

In the 1950s and 1960s, experimentation in the Arts spread into theater as well, with plays such as ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' including [[nudity]] and drug culture references. Musicals remained popular as well, and musicals such as ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' and ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' broke previous records. At the same time, shows like [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' began to deconstruct the musical form as it has been practiced through the mid-century, moving away from traditional plot and realistic external settings to explore the central character's inner state; his ''[[Follies]]'' relied on pastiches of the [[Ziegfeld Follies]]-styled revue; his ''[[Pacific Overtures]]'' used Japanese [[kabuki]] theatrical practices; and ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'' told its story backwards. Similarly, [[Bob Fosse]]'s production of [[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]] returned the musical to its vaudeville origins.

'''Facts and figures of the post-war theater'''&lt;!-- below is the official information, taken from the U.S. Congress hearings, copyright-free --&gt;

The post-war American theater audiences and box offices constantly diminished, due to the undeclared "offensive" of television and radio upon the classical, [[legitimate theater]]. According to James F. Reilly, executive director of the [[League of New York Theatres]], between 1930 and 1951 the number of legitimate theaters in New York City dwindled from 68 to 30. Besides of that, the admissions tax, has been a burden on the theater since 1918. It was never relaxed ever since, and was doubled in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ien.35559007406253;view=1up;seq=848 Statement of James F. Reilly, executive director of the League of New York Theatres, New York, N.Y.]. Revenue Revision of 1951, hearings, 82nd Congress, p. 2362.&lt;/ref&gt; Total seating capacity of thirty most renown legitimate theaters amounted 35,697 seats in 1951. Since 1937 in New York City alone, 14 former legitimate theaters with a normal seating capacity of 16,955, have been taken over for either [[radio broadcasts]] or [[Live television|television performances]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ien.35559007406253;view=1up;seq=849 Seating capacity of present/former legitimate theaters]. Revenue Revision of 1951, hearings, 82nd Congress, p. 2363.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s and 2000s, American theater began to borrow from cinema and operas. For instance, [[Julie Taymor]], director of ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'' directed ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. Also, Broadway musicals were developed around Disney's ''[[Mary Poppins (musical)|Mary Poppins]]'', ''[[Tarzan (musical)|Tarzan]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid (musical)|The Little Mermaid]]'', and the one that started it all, ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', which may have contributed to [[Times Square]]'s revitalization in the 1990s. Also, [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' and ''[[Young Frankenstein (musical)|Young Frankenstein]]'' are based on his hit films.

===Drama===
{{Expand section|coverage of the late 1990s and more information about the mid-century periods|date=July 2010}}
The early years of the 20th century, before World War I, continued to see realism as the main development in drama. But starting around 1900, there was a revival of poetic drama in the States, corresponding to a similar revival in Europe (e.g. [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck|Maeterlinck]] and [[Gerhart Hauptmann|Hauptmann]]). The most notable example of this trend was the "Biblical trilogy" of [[William Vaughn Moody]], which also illustrate the rise of religious-themed drama during the same years, as seen in the 1899 production of ''[[Ben-Hur (play)|Ben-Hur]]'' and two 1901 adaptations of ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]''. Moody, however, is best known for two prose plays, ''The Great Divide'' (1906, later [[The Great Divide (1925 film)|adapted into three film versions]]) and ''The Faith Healer'' (1909), which together point the way to modern American drama in their emphasis on the emotional conflicts that lie at the heart of contemporary social conflicts. Other key playwrights from this period (in addition to continued work by Howells and Fitch) include [[Edward Sheldon]], [[Charles Rann Kennedy (playwright)|Charles Rann Kennedy]] and one of the most successful women playwrights in American drama, [[Rachel Crothers]], whose interest in women's issues can be seen in such plays as ''He and She'' (1911).&lt;ref name=Meserve/&gt;

During the period between the World Wars, American drama came to maturity, thanks in large part to the works of [[Eugene O'Neill]] and of the [[Provincetown Players]]. O'Neill's experiments with theatrical form and his combination of [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalist]] and [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionist]] techniques inspired other playwrights to use greater freedom in their works, whether expanding the techniques of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], as in [[Susan Glaspell]]'s ''[[Trifles]]'', or borrowing more heavily from German Expressionism (e.g., [[Elmer Rice]]'s ''[[The Adding Machine]]''), Other distinct movements during this period include folk-drama/regionalism ([[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]]'s Pulitzer-winning ''[[In Abraham's Bosom]]''), "pageant" drama (Green's ''[[Lost Colony (play)|The Lost Colony]]'', about the mysterious [[Roanoke Colony]]), and even a return to poetic drama ([[Maxwell Anderson]]'s ''[[Winterset (play)|Winterset]]''). At the same time, the economic crisis of the [[Great Depression]] led to the growth of protest drama, as seen in the [[Federal Theatre Project]]'s [[Living Newspaper]] productions and in the works of [[Clifford Odets]] (e.g., ''[[Waiting for Lefty]]'') and of moralist drama, as in [[Lillian Hellman]]'s ''[[The Little Foxes]]'' and ''[[The Children's Hour (play)|The Children's Hour]]''. Other key figures of this era include [[George S. Kaufman]], [[George Kelly (playwright)|George Kelly]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[S. N. Behrman]], [[Sidney Howard]], [[Robert E. Sherwood]], and a set of playwrights who followed O'Neill's path of philosophical searching, [[Philip Barry]], [[Thornton Wilder]] (''[[Our Town]]'') and [[William Saroyan]] (''[[The Time of Your Life]]''). Theater criticism kept pace with the drama, such as in the work of [[George Jean Nathan]] and in the numerous books and journals on American theater that were published during this time.&lt;ref name=Meserve/&gt;

The stature that American drama had achieved between the Wars was cemented during the post-World War II generation, with the final works of O'Neill and his generation being joined by such towering figures as [[Tennessee Williams]] and [[Arthur Miller]], as well as by the maturation of the musical theatre form. Other key dramatists include [[William Inge]], [[Arthur Laurents]] and [[Paddy Chayefsky]] in the 1950s, the ''avant garde'' movement of [[Jack Richardson (playwright)|Jack Richardson]], [[Arthur Kopit]], [[Jack Gelber]] and [[Edward Albee]] the 1960s, and the maturation of black drama through [[Lorraine Hansberry]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] and [[Amiri Baraka]]. In the musical theater, important figures include [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], [[Lerner and Loewe]], [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]], [[Richard Adler]] and [[Jerry Ross (composer)|Jerry Ross]], [[Frank Loesser]], [[Jule Styne]], [[Jerry Bock]], [[Meredith Willson]] and [[Stephen Sondheim]].&lt;ref name=Meserve/&gt;

The period beginning in the mid-1960s, with the passing of Civil Rights legislation and its repercussions, came the rise of an "agenda" theater comparable to that of the 1930s. Many of the major playwrights from the mid-century continued to produce new works, but were joined by names like [[Sam Shepard]], [[Neil Simon]], [[Romulus Linney (playwright)|Romulus Linney]], [[David Rabe]], [[Lanford Wilson]], [[David Mamet]], and [[John Guare]]. Many important dramatists were women, including [[Beth Henley]], [[Marsha Norman]], [[Wendy Wasserstein]], [[Megan Terry]], [[Paula Vogel]] and [[María Irene Fornés]]. The growth of ethnic pride movements led to more success by dramatists from racial minorities, such as black playwrights [[Douglas Turner Ward]], [[Adrienne Kennedy]], [[Ed Bullins]], [[Charles Fuller]], [[Suzan-Lori Parks]], [[Ntozake Shange]], [[George C. Wolfe]] and [[August Wilson]], who created a dramatic history of United States with his cycle of plays, ''The Pittsburgh Cycle'', one for each decade of the 20th century. Asian-American theater is represented in the early 1970s by [[Frank Chin]] and achieved international success with [[David Henry Hwang]]'s ''[[M. Butterfly]]''. Latino theater grew from the local activist performances of [[Luis Valdez]]'s Chicano-focused ''[[Teatro Campesino]]'' to his more formal plays, such as ''[[Zoot Suit (play)|Zoot Suit]]'', and later to the award-winning work of Cuban Americans Fornés (multiple Obies) and her student [[Nilo Cruz]] (Pulitzer), to Puerto Rican playwrights [[José Rivera (playwright)|José Rivera]] and [[Miguel Piñero]], and to the Tony Award-winning musical about Dominicans in New York City, ''[[In the Heights]]''. Finally, the rise of the gay rights movement and of the AIDS crisis led to a number of important gay and lesbian dramatists, including [[Christopher Durang]], [[Holly Hughes (performance artist)|Holly Hughes]], [[Karen Malpede]], [[Terrence McNally]], [[Larry Kramer]], [[Tony Kushner]], whose ''[[Angels in America]]'' won the Tony Award two years in a row, and composer-playwright [[Jonathan Larson]], whose musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' ran for over twelve years.&lt;ref name=Meserve/&gt;

==American theater today==
Earlier styles of theater such as [[minstrel show]]s and [[Vaudeville]] acts have disappeared from the landscape, but theater remains a popular American art form. Broadway productions still entertain millions of theater-goers as productions have become more elaborate and expensive. At the same time, theater has also served as a platform for expression, and a venue for identity exploration for under-represented, minority communities, who have formed their own companies and created their own genres of works, notably [[East West Players]], founded in 1965 as the first [[Asian-American theatre]] group. Notable contemporary American playwrights include [[Edward Albee]], [[August Wilson]], [[Tony Kushner]], [[David Henry Hwang]], [[John Guare]], and [[Wendy Wasserstein]]. Smaller urban theaters have stayed a source of innovation, and regional theaters remain an important part of theater life. Drama is also taught in high schools and colleges, which was not done in previous eras, and many become interested in theater through this.

''[[The Faster Times]]'', an online newspaper that ran from 2009 to 2013, featured a weekly column that discussed issues and trends in American theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thefastertimes.com/theatertalk/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713175628/http://thefastertimes.com/theatertalk/ |archivedate=July 13, 2009 |df=mdy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trucks and Tractor Power''' was a weekly [[television show]] on [[Spike TV|TNN]] featuring [[mud bogging]], [[tractor pulling]] and [[monster trucks]].  The show's original hosts were Stan Rhoads and former [[Bigfoot (truck)|Bigfoot]] driver Rich Hooser, along with pit reporter Mike Goss. [[Gary Lee (reporter)|Gary Lee]] replaced Stan Rhoads.  [[Army Armstrong]] later joined as a pit reporter, and later, when Hooser left the show, became [[color commentator]].  The show initially began in 1989 as a vehicle for [[TNT Motorsports]] events, complimenting their [[ESPN]] show [[Powertrax]] and [[Television syndication|syndicated]] show [[Tuff Trax]], and would typically alternate between truck and tractor pulls and monster trucks, with National Mud Racing Organization mud races intermittently. After TNT was bought out by the [[United States Hot Rod Association]] in 1991, the show began primarily airing the Pendaliner Monster Truck Series and NMRO mud races held at [[Special Events]]' [[4-Wheel and Off-Road Jamboree]]s. A frequent feature of these shows was a highlight segment of "Tough Truck" amateur off-road races near the end of the monster truck episodes. The final season of Trucks and Tractor Power had Gary Lee as the host at the Monster Truck Thunder Drags, with Dave Rief, and later Tom Rivers, for the Jamborees. At the end of the 1996 season, the Pendaliner cancelled their sponsorship of the monster truck series, causing the show to be subsequently cancelled.

The '''Wharf Revue''' is a series of [[musical comedy]] [[revue]]s presented by the [[Sydney Theatre Company]]. Each show features four comedians - usually [[Jonathan Biggins]], [[Phillip Scott (actor)|Phillip Scott]] and [[Drew Forsythe]], accompanied by a female performer - satirising media personalities and political events in sketches and songs. The music and lyrics are largely written by Scott. Female Wharf Revue performers have included [[Amanda Bishop]], [[Genevieve Lemon]] and [[Helen Dallimore]] (filling in).

The revue has become something of a [[Sydney]] cultural institution.

The '''Whitehall farces''' were a series of five long-running comic stage plays at the [[Whitehall Theatre]] in London, presented by the [[actor-manager]] [[Brian Rix]], in the 1950s and 1960s. They were in the [[low comedy]] tradition of British [[farce]], following the [[Aldwych farce]]s, which played at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] between 1924 and 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Nightingale, Benedict.

Rix built a company of regular players who appeared in some or all of these shows. They included [[Leo Franklyn]], Larry Noble, Dennis Ramsden and [[Derek Royle]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; and members of Rix's family: his wife, [[Elspet Gray]], his sister, [[Sheila Mercier]] and his brother-in-law, Peter Mercier. Others who appeared in one or more of the Whitehall farces include [[Terry Scott]]&lt;ref&gt;Gaye, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrew Sachs]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Rix starred in all five plays, in a range of roles: a "gormless recruit" to the army in ''Reluctant Heroes'';&lt;ref&gt;"Whitehall Theatre", ''The Times'', 13 September 1950, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; a timidly crooked [[bookie]]'s runner in ''Dry Rot'';&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; a street musician recruited as a secret agent in ''Simple Spymen'';&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; four identical brothers in ''One For the Pot'';&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; and a harassed civil servant in ''Chase Me, Comrade''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; From ''Dry Rot'' onwards, Rix and his authors developed a double act for the Rix characters and those played by Leo Franklyn, in which the two performers played off one another rather as [[Ralph Lynn]] and [[Tom Walls]] had done in the Aldwych farces of the previous generation.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 58, 77 and 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the five plays had long runs and packed houses, most London critics were snobbishly dismissive of them. Looking back in 1980, [[Michael Coveney]] wrote of the Whitehall farces, "A tradition of critical snobbery has grown up around these plays, partly because they were so blatantly popular but chiefly because of our conviction that farce, unless written by a Frenchman, is an inferior theatrical species. Once the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] has done its duty by [[J.B. Priestley|Priestley]] and [[Terence Rattigan|Rattigan]] and others teetering on the brink of theatrical respectability I suggest they employ Mr. Rix … to investigate the ignored riches of English farce between [[Ben Travers|Travers]] and [[Alan Ayckbourn|Ayckbourn]]."&lt;ref&gt;Coveney, Michael. "Simple Spymen", ''[[The Financial Times]]'', 11 August 1980, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The few London critics of the 1950s and 1960s who did not take a lofty view included [[Harold Hobson]], Ronald Bryden, J. W. Lambert and [[Alan Dent]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television broadcasts; later productions===
In addition to the five long-running farces, Rix presented a series of more than eighty one-off televised comedies, some of them farces, for the [[BBC]]. The first was transmitted live from the Whitehall Theatre in January 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Rix, Brian. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/07/whitehall-farces-tv-theatre-relationship "The Whitehall farces had a major role in the TV-theatre relationship"], ''The Guardian'', 7 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; There were also film versions of ''[[Reluctant Heroes]]'' (1951), ''[[Dry Rot (film)|Dry Rot]]'' (1956), and ''Chase Me, Comrade'', which was renamed ''[[Not Now, Comrade]]'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/reluctant-heroes-107563/cast |title=Reluctant Heroes (1951) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |publisher=AllMovie |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDb&gt;{{IMDb title|0155104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/cdc65/dry-rot |title=Dry Rot &amp;#124; Film review and movie reviews |work=Radio Times |date=2013-04-08 |accessdate=2014-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://networkonair.com/features/2013/05/09/not-now-comrade/|title=Networkonair &gt; Features  &gt; Not Now Comrade|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, having been unable to secure the lease of the Whitehall Theatre, Rix took his company on tour in ''Chase Me, Comrade'' and ''Bang, Bang Beirut'' (later retitled ''Stand By Your Bedouin''), by Cooney and Hilton.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Later productions by the Rix company at the [[Garrick Theatre]] and elsewhere included ''Uproar in the House'', by [[Anthony Marriott]] and Alistair Foot (1967); ''Let Sleeping Wives Lie'' by Harold Brooke and Kay Bannerman (1967); ''She's Done It Again'', by [[Michael Pertwee]] (1969); ''Don't Just Lie There, Say Something'' (Pertwee, 1971); and ''A Bit Between the Teeth'' (Pertwee, 1974). According to Leslie Smith in a study of modern British farce, although some of the Rix productions after ''Chase Me, Comrade'' achieved substantial success, none of them had the conspicuously long runs of the five Whitehall farces.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 Rix returned to the Whitehall with Fringe Benefits (Churchill and Cooney)  which ran until 1977 when he retired from the stage.

'''Şerafettin Taşliova''' (1938 – 20 September 2014) was a Turkish storyteller in the [[Ashik|asik]] [[bardic]] tradition.

Taşliova has won many prizes at bardic contests for improvised poetry and storytelling; many at international level. He has also been awarded by UNESCO.
He started writing poetry around the age of ten and is widely recognised for his ability to tell epic tales, being one of the most prominent figures in the northeastern Anatolian tradition of minstrelsy,

He is a prolific published author of poetry, and has also recorded many albums of his poetry and bardic stories.

Taşliova has also had a long career in broadcasting.  He makes appearances on a number of Turkish television stations, and has been making a regular radio broadcast since 1966, he has also appeared in the [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]] BBC documentaries ''[[In Search of the Trojan War]]'' (1985) and ''[[In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great]]'' (1997), in which he demonstrates the oral traditions of the storyteller.

==Early life==
He was born in the village of [[Pekşeren]] ([[Gülyüzü]]), in the district of [[Çıldır]] in the [[Ardahan Province]], on April 10, 1938. His name translates as "honor". On September 13, 2014, he was carried to the Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital. Seven days after he was operated, he died on September 20, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Milliyet newspaper: [http://www.milliyet.com.tr/unesco-yasayan-insan-hazinesi--gundem-1943385/ "UNESCO 'yaşayan insan hazinesi' Aşık Şeref Taşlıova vefat etti."] September 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CNN Türk: [http://www.cnnturk.com/video/kultur-sanat/diger/devlet-sanatcisi-asik-seref-tasliova-vefat-etti "Devlet sanatçısı Aşık Şeref Taşlıova vefat etti."] September 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wider recognition==
In 1986, the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism established a database of living folk poets, 557 âşıks were registered in the database including Şeref Taşlıova. On the 4 July 2008 and using this database, Taşlıova was identified and nominated for UNESCO living human treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/doc/src/00179-Nomination_form.doc |title=Nomination for inscription on the Representative List in 2009 (Reference No. 00179).
