The '''A172''' is a major road in [[North Yorkshire]], and the [[unitary authority]] of [[Middlesbrough]], [[England]]. It runs from [[Ingleby Arncliffe]] to [[Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref name=rediff&gt;{{cite web|title=A172 road (England)|url=http://pages.rediff.com/a172-road--england-/1041984#!info|publisher=Rediff.Com|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite web|title=A172 road (England)|url=https://www.google.com.np/search?q=A172+road+(England)&amp;sa=N&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=FYslUtKoL4exrge624HYAg&amp;ved=0CGQQsAQ4Cg&amp;biw=1088&amp;bih=489|publisher=Google|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The road derives its adumbrated number from 1969 when a thoroughfare link connected South Teesside with the Lackenby Docks in Middlesbrough.  Since further urban infrastructure development it has been extended into the North Yorkshire Moors, when it transforms into A174.

==Marton Road==
Marton Road is that part of the length of the A172 that links [[Middlesbrough]] to [[Easterside|Ladgate Lane]]. In 1960 [[Middlesbrough County Borough Council]] identified a need for the imposition of a speed limit to control congestion in the city.

Marton Road itself runs from the centre of Middlesbrough, starting at around the site of the old St. John's Church and runs to Marton Crossroads at Ladgate Lane.  Along its route the road passes several sites of local interest, including the [[James Cook University Hospital]], and [[Stewart Park Middlesbrough|Stewart Park]].  The road can become congested and is famous locally for the "Marton Crawl" which happens during peak times.  The Marton Crawl can take anything up to 20 minutes to get from Middlesbrough town centre to [[Marton, Middlesbrough|Marton]] itself.  This section of the road has ten speed cameras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/tees/content/articles/2005/03/14/speed_camera_140305_feature.shtml Speed Cameras Retrieved 2017-12-07]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pannierman Lane ==
Pannierman Lane is that part of the road that is part of the [[Nunthorpe]] by-pass, and continues to [[Stokesley]].

==Stokesley Road==
[[File:Row of Cottages, Marton Road - geograph.org.uk - 55056.jpg|thumb|Cottages along the road]]
On 29 July 1963, The Transport Minister, Ernest Marples announced a new by-pass for the village of Stokesley.  This was the origin of the link road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/search/A172+by-pass+road A172 Road] Retrieved 2017-12-07&lt;/ref&gt;  However edited version of Hansard implies that the new Labour Government re-routed the proposal in 1965 making a [[Compulsory Purchase Order]] of the required land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1965/aug/03/stokesly-by-pass#S5CV0717P0_19650803_CWA_166 T Fraser MP] Retrieved 2017-12-08&lt;/ref&gt;  The A172 changes its name to Stokesley Road at Marton Crossroads, passing through [[Marton-in-Cleveland]].  The road can be used to join the [[A19 road|A19]] north to Newcastle and Sunderland and south. The road also joins the [[A174 road|A174]] (at this point called the Parkway) to the coastal towns of [[Redcar]], [[Saltburn-by-the-Sea|Saltburn]] and [[Whitby]].

There are a number of bus services which operate along part or all of the road. Amongst these are: 27(Marton-Netherfields), 28 (Saltburn), 29 (Stokesley) and 63 (Redcar), which are operated by [[Arriva]].

=== Planned changes ===
In May 2016 a section of the road 1.5 miles long by the Blue Bell Inn was re-surfaced by the Highways Authority at Coulby Newham.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/improved-road-surface-for-drivers-on-a174-in-middlesbrough re-surfacing] Retrieved 2017-12-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dixons Bank==
[[File:Dixon's Bank - geograph.org.uk - 1061098.jpg|thumb|Dixons Bank in Nunthorpe]]
After the junction with Stainton Way, the name changes to Dixons Bank.  As of December 2017 major road improvements are underway at a critical junction, Stainton Way in South Middlesbrough, which will widen access, increase traffic flow, increase highway drainage schemes, and improve street lighting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.middlesbrough.gov.uk/news/consultation-underway-junction-proposals Traffic Schemes] Retrieved 2017-12-07&lt;/ref&gt;

The road heads south through the Cleveland Hills and Commondale before it joins the A19.

The '''Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex''' ({{Lang-es|Complejo volcánico Altiplano-Puna|links=no}}), also known as '''APVC''', is a [[Volcanic group|complex]] of volcanic systems in the [[Puna de Atacama|Puna]] of the [[Andes]]. It is located in the [[Altiplano]] area, a [[highland]] bounded by the Bolivian [[Cordillera Real (Bolivia)|Cordillera Real]] in the east and by the main chain of the Andes, the [[Cordillera Occidental (Bolivia)|Western Cordillera]], in the west. It results from the [[subduction]] of the [[Nazca Plate]] beneath the [[South American Plate]]. [[Magma|Melts]] caused by subduction have generated the volcanoes of the [[Andean Volcanic Belt]] including the APVC. The volcanic province is located between 21° S–24° S [[latitude]]. The APVC spans the countries of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Chile]].&lt;ref name="SchnurrTrumbull2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schnurr|first1=W. B. W.|last2=Trumbull|first2=R.

At least three volcanic centres ([[Guacha caldera]], [[La Pacana]], [[Pastos Grandes]], [[Vilama (caldera)|Vilama]]) had eruptions of a [[Volcanic explosivity index|Volcanic Exposivity Index (VEI)]] of [[List of largest volcanic eruptions|8]], as well as smaller scale eruptive centres.&lt;ref name="SalisburyJicha2010" /&gt; Activity waned after 2 [[mya (unit)|mya]], but present-day [[geothermal]] activity and volcanoes dated to the [[Holocene]], as well as recent [[Prediction of volcanic activity#Ground deformation|ground deformation]] at [[Uturunku]] volcano indicate still-extant present-day activity of the system.

==Geography==

The [[Andes]] mountain chain originated from the subduction of the [[Nazca Plate]] below the South American Plate and was accompanied by extensive volcanism. Between 14° S and 28° S lies one volcanic area with over fifty recently active systems, the [[Central Volcanic Zone]] (CVZ). Since the late [[Miocene]] between 21° S and 24° S a major [[ignimbrite]] province formed over {{convert|70|km}} thick crust, the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex, between the [[Atacama]] and the [[Altiplano]]. The [[Lake Toba|Toba]] volcanic system in [[Indonesia]] and [[Taupo]] in New Zealand are analogous to the province.&lt;ref name="Fernandez-TurielGarcia-Valles2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fernandez-Turiel|first1=J.

==Geology==
[[File:Chao dacite domes.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of the Chao lava dome and flows|The lobate flows of the [[Cerro Chao]] lava dome]]
The APVC is generated by the [[subduction]] of the [[Nazca Plate]] beneath the [[South American Plate]] at an angle of nearly 30°. [[Delamination]] of the crust has occurred beneath the northern Puna and southern Altiplano. Below {{convert|20|km}} depth, seismic data indicate the presence of melts in a layer called the Altiplano–Puna low velocity zone or Altiplano Puna magma body. Regional variations of activity north and south of 24°S have been attributed to the southwards moving subduction of the [[Juan Fernández Ridge]]. This southwards migration results in a steepening of the subducting plate behind the ridge, causing [[decompression melting]].&lt;ref name="KayCoira2010" /&gt; Between 1:4 to 1:6 of the generated melts are erupted to the surface as [[ignimbrite]]s.&lt;ref name="KayCoira2010" /&gt;

[[Mafic]] rocks are associated with [[strike-slip fault]]s and normal [[fault (geology)|fault]]s and are found in the southern Puna and Altiplano. The southern Puna has [[calc-alkaline]] [[andesites]] erupted after 7 [[mya (unit)|mya]], with the least [[evolved]] magmas being the 6.7 mya [[Cerro Morado]] and 8–7 m [[Rachaite complex]] flows. [[Basaltic]] over [[Shoshonite|shoshonitic]] (both 25 and 21 m) to [[andesitic]] (post-[[Miocene]]) lavas are found in the southern Altiplano.&lt;ref name="KayCoira2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kay|first1=Suzanne Mahlburg|last2=Coira|first2=Beatriz L.|last3=Caffe|first3=Pablo J.|last4=Chen|first4=Chang-Hwa|title=Regional chemical diversity, crustal and mantle sources and evolution of central Andean Puna plateau ignimbrites|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|volume=198|issue=1–2| year=2010|pages=81–111|doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2010.08.013|bibcode=2010JVGR..198...81K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignimbrites deposited during eruptions of APVC volcanoes are formed by "boiling over" eruptions, where magma chambers containing viscous crystal-rich volatile-poor magmas partially empty in tranquil, non-explosive fashion. As a result, the deposits are massive and homogeneous and show few size segregation or fluidization features. Such eruptions have been argued to require external triggers to occur.&lt;ref name="KayCoira2010" /&gt; There is a volume-dependent relationship between homogeneity of the eruption products and their volume; large volume ignimbrites have uniform mineralogical and compositional heterogeneity. Small volume ignimbrites often show gradation in composition. This pattern has been observed in other volcanic centres such as the [[Fish Canyon Tuff]] in the United States and the [[Lake Toba|Toba]] ignimbrites in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="de Silva1991"&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Silva|first1=S. L.|title=Andean Magmatism and Its Tectonic Setting|volume=265|year=1991|pages=217–232|doi=10.1130/SPE265-p217|chapter=Styles of zoning in central Andean ignimbrites; Insights into magma chamber processes|series=Geological Society of America Special Papers|isbn=0-8137-2265-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrologically, ignimbrites are derived from [[dacitic]]–[[rhyodacitic]] magmas. [[Phenocryst]]s include [[biotite]], [[iron|Fe]]–[[titanium|Ti]]-oxides, [[plagioclase]] and [[quartz]] with minor [[apatite]] and [[titanite]]. Northern Puna ignimbrites also contain [[amphibole]], and [[clinopyroxene]] and [[orthopyroxene]] occur in low-[[Silicon|Si]] magmas, while higher Si magmas also contain [[sanidine]]. These magmas have temperatures of {{convert|700|-|850|C}} and originate in depths of {{convert|4|-|8|km}}.&lt;ref name="KayCoira2010" /&gt; The ignimbrites are collectively referred to as San Bartolo and Silapeti Groups.&lt;ref name="de Silva1989" /&gt;

Eruptions are affected by the local conditions, resulting in high altitude eruption columns that are sorted by westerly stratospheric winds. Coarse deposits are deposited close to the vents, while fine ash is carried to the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] and eastern cordillera. The highest volcanoes in the world are located here, including {{convert|6887|m}} high [[Ojos del Salado]] and {{convert|6723|m}} high [[Llullaillaco]]. Some volcanoes have undergone flank collapses covering as much as {{convert|200|km2}}.&lt;ref name="AllmendingerJordan1997" /&gt; Most calderas are associated with fault systems that may play a role in caldera formation.&lt;ref name="RillerPetrinovic2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riller|first1=Ulrich|last2=Petrinovic|first2=Ivan|last3=Ramelow|first3=Juliane|last4=Strecker|first4=Manfred|last5=Oncken|first5=Onno|title=Late Cenozoic tectonism, collapse caldera and plateau formation in the central Andes|journal=[[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]]|volume=188|issue=3–4|year=2001|pages=299–311|doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(01)00333-8|bibcode=2001E&amp;PSL.188..299R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific investigation==

==Geologic history==

The APVC area before the upper Miocene was largely formed from [[sedimentary]] layers of [[Ordovician]] to Miocene age and deformed during previous stages of Andean orogeny, with low volume volcanics.&lt;ref name="CaffeSoler2008" /&gt; Activity until the late [[Miocene]] was [[effusive]] with [[andesite]] as the major product.&lt;ref name="Fernandez-TurielGarcia-Valles2005"/&gt; After a volcanic pause related to [[flat slab subduction]], starting from 27 [[mya (unit)|mya]] volcanism increased suddenly.&lt;ref name="SalisburyJicha2010" /&gt;

Ignimbrites range in age from 25 [[mya (unit)|mya]] to 1 mya.&lt;ref name="Ort1993" /&gt; In the late [[Miocene]], more evolved [[andesite]] magmas were erupted and the crustal components increased. In the late [[Tertiary]] until the [[Quaternary]], a sudden decrease of [[mafic]] volcanism coupled with a sudden appearance of [[rhyodacitic]] and [[dacitic]] [[ignimbrite]]s occurred.&lt;ref name="LaubeSpringer1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laube|first1=Norbert|last2=Springer|first2=Jörn|title=Crustal melting by ponding of mafic magmas: A numerical model|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|volume=81|issue=1–2|year=1998|pages=19–35|doi=10.1016/S0377-0273(97)00072-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this flare-up it erupted primarily [[dacite]]s with subordinate amounts of [[rhyolite]]s and andesites.&lt;ref name="Ort1993" /&gt; The area was uplifted during the flare-up and the crust thickened to {{convert|60|-|70|km}}.&lt;ref name="CaffeSoler2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caffe|first1=P.

In the southern Puna, backarc activity set in 14–12 Ma and the largest eruptions occurred after 4 Ma.&lt;ref name="KayCoira2010" /&gt; The start of ignimbritic activity is not contemporaneous in the entire APVC area; north of 21°S the [[Alto de Pica Formation|Alto de Pica]] and [[Oxaya Formation]]s formed 15–17 and 18–23 mya respectively, whereas south of 21°S large scale ignimbrite activity didn't begin until 10.6 mya.&lt;ref name="de Silva1989" /&gt;

Activity waned after 2 [[mya (unit)|mya]],&lt;ref name="del PotroDíez2013" /&gt; and after 1 mya and during the [[Holocene]], activity was mostly [[andesitic]] in nature with large ignimbrites absent. Activity with composition similar to ignimbrites was limited to the eruption of [[lava dome]]s and flows, interpreted as escaping from a regional [[sill (geology)|sill]] {{convert|1|-|4|km}} high at {{convert|14|-|17|km}} depth.&lt;ref name="Fernandez-TurielGarcia-Valles2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="de Silva1991" /&gt;

The APVC is still active, with recent unrest and ground inflation detected by [[InSAR]] at [[Uturuncu]] volcano starting in 1996. Research indicates that this unrest results from the intrusion of dacitic magma at {{convert|17|km}} or more depth and may be a prelude to caldera formation and large scale eruptive activity.&lt;ref name="SparksFolkes2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sparks|first1=R.

==Extent==

The APVC erupted over an area of {{convert|70000|km2}}&lt;ref name="HickeyGottsmann2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hickey|first1=James|last2=Gottsmann|first2=Joachim|last3=del Potro|first3=Rodrigo|title=The large-scale surface uplift in the Altiplano-Puna region of Bolivia: A parametric study of source characteristics and crustal rheology using finite element analysis|journal=Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems|volume=14|issue=3|year=2013 |pages=540–555|doi=10.1002/ggge.20057}}&lt;/ref&gt; from ten major systems, some active over millions of years and comparable to [[Yellowstone Caldera]] and [[Long Valley Caldera]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Fernandez-TurielGarcia-Valles2005"/&gt; The APVC is the largest ignimbrite province of the [[Neogene]]&lt;ref name="del PotroDíez2013" /&gt; with a volume of at least {{convert|15000|km3}},&lt;ref name="HickeyGottsmann2013" /&gt; and the underlying magmatic body is considered to be the largest [[continent]]al melt zone,&lt;ref name="del PotroDíez2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=del Potro|first1=Rodrigo|last2=Díez|first2=Mikel|last3=Blundy|first3=Jon|last4=Camacho|first4=Antonio G.|last5=Gottsmann|first5=Joachim|title=Diapiric ascent of silicic magma beneath the Bolivian Altiplano|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=40|issue=10|year=2013|pages=2044–2048|doi=10.1002/grl.50493}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming a [[batholith]].&lt;ref name="de Silva1989" /&gt; Alternatively, the body revealed by seismic studies is the remnant mush of the magma accumulation zone.&lt;ref name="de SilvaGosnold2007" /&gt; Deposits from the volcanoes cover a surface area of more than {{convert|500000|km2}}.&lt;ref name="AllmendingerJordan1997" /&gt; [[La Pacana]] is the largest single complex in the APVC with dimensions {{convert|100|x|70|km2}}, including the {{convert|65|x|35|km}} caldera.&lt;ref name="de Silva1989" /&gt;

Magma generation rates during the pulses are about {{convert|0.001|km3/yr|m3/s}}, based on the assumption that for each {{convert|50|-|100|km3}} of arc there is one caldera. These rates are substantially higher than the average for the Central Volcanic Zone, {{convert|0.00015 - 0.0003|km3/yr|m3/s}}. During the three strong pulses, extrusion was even higher at {{convert|0.004 - 0.012|km3/yr|m3/s}}. Intrusion rates range from {{convert|0.003 - 0.005|km3/yr|m3/s}} and resulted in [[plutons]] of {{convert|30000|-|50000|km3}} volume beneath the calderas.&lt;ref name="de SilvaGosnold2007" /&gt;

==Source of magmas==

Modelling indicates a system where [[andesitic]] melts coming from the mantle rise through the [[crust (geology)|crust]] and generate a zone of [[mafic]] volcanism. Increases in the melt flux and thus heat and volatile input causes [[partial melting]] of the crust, forming a layer containing melts reaching down to the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity|Moho]] that inhibits the ascent of mafic magmas because of its higher [[buoyancy]]. Instead, melts generated in this zone eventually reach the surface, generating felsic volcanism. Some mafic magmas escape sideward after stalling in the melt containing zone; these generate more mafic volcanic systems at the edge of the felsic volcanism,&lt;ref name="LaubeSpringer1998" /&gt; such as [[Cerro Bitiche]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The magmas are mixtures of crust derived and mafic mantle-derived melts with a consistent [[petrology|petrological]] and chemical signature.&lt;ref name="del PotroDíez2013" /&gt; The melt generation process may involve several different layers in the crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kern|first1=Jamie M.|last2=de Silva|first2=Shanaka L.|last3=Schmitt|first3=Axel K.|last4=Kaiser|first4=Jason F.|last5=Iriarte|first5=A. Rodrigo|last6=Economos|first6=Rita|title=Geochronological imaging of an episodically constructed subvolcanic batholith: U-Pb in zircon chronochemistry of the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex of the Central Andes|journal=Geosphere|date=August 2016|volume=12|issue=4|pages=1054–1077|doi=10.1130/GES01258.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model requires the intrusion of [[basaltic]] melts into an amphibole crust, resulting in the formation of hybrid magmas. Partial melting of the crust and of hydrous basalt generates [[andesitic]]–[[dacitic]] melts that escape upwards. A residual forms composed from [[garnet]] [[pyroxenite]] at a depth of {{convert|50|km}}. This residual is denser than the mantle [[peridotite]] and can cause delamination of the lower crust containing the residual.&lt;ref name="KayCoira2010" /&gt;

Between 18 and 12 [[mya (unit)|mya]] the Puna-Altiplano region was subject to an episode of flat subduction of the [[Nazca Plate]]. A steepening of the subduction after 12 mya resulted in the influx of hot asthenosphere.&lt;ref name="RamosFolguera2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramos|first1=V. A.|last2=Folguera|first2=A.|title=Andean flat-slab subduction through time|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|volume=327|issue=1 |year=2009|pages=31–54|doi=10.1144/SP327.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until that point, differentiation and crystallization of rising mafic magmas had mostly produced andesitic magmas. The change in plate movements and increased melt generation caused an overturn and [[anatexis]] of the melt generating zone, forming a density barrier for mafic melts which subsequently ponded below the melt generating zone. Dacitic melts escaped from this zone, forming [[diapir]]s and the magma chambers that generated APVC ignimbrite volcanism.&lt;ref name="de Silva1989" /&gt;

Magma generation in the APVC is periodical, with pulses recognized 10, 8, 6, and 4 mya. The first stage included the Artola, Granada, Lower Rio San Pedro and Mucar ignimbrites. The second pulse involved the Panizos, Sifon and Vilama ignimbrites and the third was the largest, with a number of ignimbrites. The fourth pulse was weaker than the preceding ones and involved the Patao and Talabre ignimbrites among others.&lt;ref name="de SilvaGosnold2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Silva|first1=Shanaka L.|last2=Gosnold|first2=William D.|title=Episodic construction of batholiths: Insights from the spatiotemporal development of an ignimbrite flare-up|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|volume=167|issue=1–4|year=2007|pages=320–335|doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2007.07.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magmas beneath the APVC are noticeably rich in [[water]] derived from the subduction of water-rich rocks. A volume ratio of about 10-20% of water has been invoked to explain the pattern of electrical conductivity at a depth of {{convert|15|-|30|km}}. The total amount of water has been estimated to be {{circa}} {{convert|14,000,000,000,000,000|kg}}, comparable to [[List of largest lakes on Earth|large lakes on Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laumonier|first1=Mickael|last2=Gaillard|first2=Fabrice|last3=Muir|first3=Duncan|last4=Blundy|first4=Jon|last5=Unsworth|first5=Martyn|title=Giant magmatic water reservoirs at mid-crustal depth inferred from electrical conductivity and the growth of the continental crust|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|date=January 2017|volume=457|pages=173–180|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2016.10.023|bibcode=2017E&amp;PSL.457..173L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tomographic studies==

[[Seismic tomography]] is a technique that uses [[seismic wave]]s produced by earthquakes to gather information on the composition of the [[crust (geology)|crust]] and [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] below a volcanic system. Different layers and structures in the Earth have different propagation speeds of seismic waves and [[attenuate]] them differently, resulting in different arrival times and strengths of waves travelling in a certain direction. From various measurements [[3D rendering|3D]] models of the geological structures can be inferred. Results of such research indicate that a highly hydrated [[slab (geology)|slab]] derived from the [[Nazca Plate]] – a major source of melts in a collisional volcanism system – underlies the Western Cordillera. Below the Altiplano, low-velocity zones indicate the presence of large amounts of partial melts that correlate with volcanic zones south of 21° S, whereas north of 21° S thicker lithospheric layers may prevent the formation of melts. Next to the Eastern Cordillera, low-velocity zones extend farther north to 18.5° S.&lt;ref name="MyersBeck1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myers|first1=Stephen C.|last2=Beck|first2=Susan|last3=Zandt|first3=George|last4=Wallace|first4=Terry|title=Lithospheric-scale structure across the Bolivian Andes from tomographic images of velocity and attenuation forPandSwaves|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=103|issue=B9 |year=1998|pages=21233–21252|doi=10.1029/98JB00956|bibcode=1998JGR...10321233M}}&lt;/ref&gt; A thermally weakened zone, evidenced by strong attenuation, in the crust is associated with the APVC.

'''Anthony Leiserowitz''' is a [[human geographer]] at [[Yale University]] who studies public perceptions of [[climate change]]. 
He has particularly examined perceptions within the United States, where people are considerably less aware of climate change than in other countries. In the U.S., awareness of information about climate change
is heavily influenced by emotion, imagery, associations, and values; public discourse reflects a lack of understanding of the science involved in climate change, and little awareness of the potential for effective responses to it.&lt;ref name="Forest"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forest |first1=Sherrie |last2=Feder |first2=Michael A. |title=Climate Change Education:  Goals, Audiences, and Strategies:  A Workshop Summary |date=2011 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=9780309218450 |url=http://research3.fit.edu/sealevelriselibrary/documents/doc_mgr/921/NRC.%202011.%20Climate%20Change%20Education%27s%20Future.pdf |accessdate=20 August 2018|pages=19-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Murray |first1=Paul |title=The Sustainable Self: A Personal Approach to Sustainability Education |date=2011 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1849712409 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4xP1PYUTaoEC&amp;pg=PA80 |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


== Early life and education ==
Leiserowitz grew up on a farm in Michigan and his parents were sculptors. He received his undergraduate degree at [[Michigan State University]] and then moved to Colorado, looking to work as ski bum.  While there he became interested in climate change, and went to [[University of Oregon]] to study under [[Paul Slovic]], an expert in [[risk perception]], and received his PhD in human geography.  

==Career==
He joined the faculty of Yale in 2007. He started to collaborate with [[Edward Maibach]] in 2008 to study people's perception of climate change.&lt;ref name=YaleAlumMag&gt;{{cite news|last1=Banerjee|first1=Neela|title=What do Americans think about global warming?|url=https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/4018-what-do-americans-think-about-global-warming|work=Yale Alumni Magazine|date=January-February 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018 he had an appointment as a senior research scientist in the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anthony Leiserowtiz in the Yale Directory |url=https://directory.yale.edu/?queryType=field&amp;upi=12484193 |publisher=Yale University |accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was Director of the [[Yale Project on Climate Change Communication]], a principal investigator at the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions at [[Columbia University]], and a research scientist at Decision Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication/about/staff|title= Staff|publisher = Yale Project on Climate Change Communication | accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

He was the recipient of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA's) 2011 Environmental Merit Award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.epa.gov/environmental-merit-awards-new-england/2012-environmental-merit-award-recipients|title = 2012 Environmental Merit Award Recipients | accessdate=January 26, 2016|publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2013 had published around 100 scientific articles and book chapters on climate change beliefs, perceptions and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://environment.yale.edu/profile/leiserowitz/publications |title = Leiserowitz Publications | publisher = Yale| accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aziz Nacib Ab'Sáber''' ({{IPA-pt|aˈziz naˈsib abˈsabeɾ}}; October 24, 1924 &amp;ndash; March 16, 2012) was an environmentalist and one of [[Brazil]]´s most respected scientists, honored with the highest awards of Brazilian science in [[geography]], [[geology]], [[ecology]] and [[archaeology]]. Graduated in geography, he was a president and honorary president of the [[Sociedade Brasileira para o Progresso da Ciência]]  (Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science), [[Emeritus Professor]] of the [[University of São Paulo]] and member of the highest rank - Order Grão-Cruz in Earth Sciences - of the  Academy of Science. Among the awards, he has received the UNESCO Prize on Science and the Environment in 2001 and the Prize to the Intellectual of Brazil in 2011.

The contributions of Ab'Saber to science range from the first research of oil camps in Brazil's northeast  to surveys of Brazil's natural realms and the restoration of the history of forests, camps and primitive humans over geologic time in South America. He made central contributions to biology, South American archaeology, and to Brazilian ecology, geology and geography. He has published more than 480 works, most of them scientific publications.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.usp.br/bibliografiadeazizabsaber.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among his scientific proposals are FLORAM, the Code of biodiversity and his theory of refuges related to the Amazones.&lt;ref&gt;Ab'Saber, A.N. 2010, A Obra de Aziz Nacib Ab'Saber San Pablo, BECA,2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Ab'Sáber was the first person to classify scientifically the Brazilian and South-America territory in morphoclimatic domains. He also contributed to the "[[Pleistocene]] refuge hypothesis", an attempt to explain the distribution of [[Neotropical]] taxa as a function of their isolation in [[forest]] fragments during [[glacial]] periods, which allowed populations to [[speciation|speciate]]. He died in 2012 following a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/vidae,morre-o-geografo-aziz-absaber,849376,0.htm "Morre o geógrafo Aziz Ab'Saber"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723110117/http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/vidae%2Cmorre-o-geografo-aziz-absaber%2C849376%2C0.htm |date=July 23, 2012 }}, [[O Estado de S.

'''Referendums on departmental autonomy statutes''' were held in four [[departments of Bolivia]]—[[Beni Department|Beni]], [[Pando Department|Pando]], [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]], and [[Tarija Department|Tarija]]—in May and June 2008. These four departments, known as the ''[[Media Luna]]'', voted in favor of autonomy in the June 2006 elections. The National Electoral Court had blocked the referendums, along with the proposed [[Bolivian constitutional referendum, 2008|referendum on Morales's new constitution]]. The referendums were also unconstitutional, as the constitution in force at the time had no provisions for departmental autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boliviainfoforum.org.uk/documents/535424538_BIF%20Bulletin%20Special%20edition%20May%202008.pdf |title=Bolivia Information Forum Bulletin, May 2008 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Framework Law on Autonomy, passed in 2010, the autonomy statutes must be harmonized with the 2009 Constitution before being enacted.

'''Cornelius Franciscus de Pauw''' or '''Cornelis de Pauw''' (''Corneille de Pauw'' in [[French language|French]]; 18 August 1739 &amp;mdash; 5 July 1799) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] philosopher, geographer and diplomat at the court of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] of [[Prussia]].

==Biography==
[[File:XantenerDomMitObelisk.JPG|thumb|[[Obelisk]] de Pauw in [[Xanten]]]]

Although born in [[Amsterdam]], son of Antonius Pauw and Quirina van Heijningen, he spent most of his life in [[Kleve]]. Working for the clergy, he nonetheless became familiar with the ideas of [[the Enlightenment]]. During his lifetime he was considered to be the greatest expert on the [[Americas]], although he never visited the continent; he also wrote at length on the origins of ancient peoples, rejecting the popular idea of the time that [[China]] was originally a [[colony]] of [[Ancient Egypt]].

He was a specialist in ethnologic studies as well, publishing a study of  American Indians in French in 1768. [[Daniel Webb (writer)|Daniel Webb]], an English scholar and translator, translated portions of de Pauw’s work into English for a public that was hungry for information regarding the new continent of America. De Paauw had no hesitation in rejecting the observations of those with personal experience of the Americas if they differed from his preconceptions, as can be seen from his comments on the [[Aztec calendar]]. Despite this, he was reputed in his lifetime to be Europe’s foremost authority on the Americas. He read the accounts of [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] and other scientists, naturalists, and explorers, and drew his own conclusions. De Pauw was of the opinion (shared with other European scientists of that time) that the American natives were inferior to natives of northern and western Europe, and that this inferiority was partly due to American climate and geography.

Some quotes from his works: &lt;blockquote&gt;The American [native], strictly speaking, is neither virtuous nor vicious. What motive has he to be either? The timidity of his soul, the weakness of his intellects, the necessity of providing for his subsistence, the powers of superstition, the influences of climate, all lead him far wide of the possibility of improvement; but he perceives it not; his happiness is, not to think; to remain in perfect inaction; to sleep a great deal; to wish for nothing, when his hunger is appeased; and to be concerned about nothing but the means of procuring food when hunger torments him. He would not build a cabin, did not cold and the inclemency of the atmosphere force him to it, nor ever quit that cabin, did not necessity thrust him out. In his understanding there is no gradation, he continues an infant to the last hour of his life. By his nature sluggish in the extreme, he is revengeful through weakness, and atrocious in his vengeance... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Europeans who pass into America degenerate, as do the animals; a proof that the climate is unfavourable to the improvement of either man or animal. The Creoles, descending from Europeans and born in America, though educated in the universities of Mexico, of Lima, and College de Santa Fe, have never produced a single book. This degradation of humanity must be imputed to the vitiated qualities of the air stagnated in their immense forests, and corrupted by noxious vapours from standing waters and uncultivated grounds…&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rejecting the existence of the Aztec calendar: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It cannot be, because such a practice presupposes a long series of astronomical observations and very precise knowledge for calculating the solar year, which cannot coincide with the prodigious ignorance in which those peoples were submerged.  How could those (peoples) have perfected their chronology who did not have words to count above ten?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are none of these languages in which is possible to count above three.  It is not possible to translate a book, not just into the languages of the Algonquins&lt;ref&gt;John Eliot had published the [[New Testament]] in 1661 and the [[Old Testament]] in 1663 in [[Massachusett]], an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]], revising his translations in 1680 and 1685.  See Jaroslav Pelikan, ''The Reformation of the Bible: The Bible of the Reformation'', New Haven (Yale University Press), 1996, pp. 156-157, including a picture of the title page of the 1663 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; or of the Guaranis or Paraguayans, but even into the languages of Mexico or Peru, because they lack a sufficient number of terms capable of enunciating general concepts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
                                                                                              
De Pauw extended his theory to the livestock and wild animals of the Americas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The degeneracy which prevails in the stranger animals, among whom I shall reckon man, differs in different provinces. Dogs, which in Peru are subject to the venereal disease, are not so in the northern regions; hogs, which dwindle in Pennsylvania, in other places lose their shape, but not their stature; in the English colonies, European sheep become smaller, without losing their wool; in the islands, as in Jamaica, they change their wool for a hair hard and coarse, which cannot be manufactured...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pauw’s work also dealt with the manners and customs unique to the natives of the Americas, ranging from the [[Inuit]] and [[First Nations|Canadian Indians]] in the north to the Peruvians in the south. De Pauw speculates on differences and similarities between the North Americans and natives in Siberia. He notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Tunguses, a people of Siberia, are, like the Canadians, grave, phlegmatic, and speak little; because they have but few ideas, and still fewer words to express them; add to this, that the silence and gloom of their forests naturally induce an habitual melancholy. Hence it is that they prefer strong and inebriating liquors, which quicken the motion of the blood, and set the machine in action, to the most precious gifts that can be made them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Tunguses hang their dead on trees, so do the Illinois of America; they cannot dig graves in the earth frozen hard to the depth of twenty feet. This is obviously nothing more than a coincidence...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a discussion about the physical characteristics of native Americans, he writes of a peculiar custom among the Caribbeans:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is in the Caribane a sort of savages who have hardly any neck, and whose shoulders rise as high as the ears; this too is factitious, and brought about by laying great weights on the head of the infant, which compress the vertebrae of the neck, and force them to descend into the hollow formed by the two bones of the upper part of the breast. These monsters appear, at a certain distance, to have the mouth in the middle of the breast; and may well renew, to travelers ignorant and delighting in wonders, the ancient fable of the Acephales, or of men without heads.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

De Pauw writes of the appearance of the "Eskimo": 

&lt;blockquote&gt;They are the most diminutive race of human kind, their stature in general not exceeding four feet. They have enormous heads, are extremely fat and corpulent, and much under-limbed. On examining the extremities of their limbs, one perceives that organization has been checked by the severity of that cold, which contracts and degrades all earthly productions. Man, however, resists this impression in higher degrees towards the Pole than trees or plants, since beyond the 68th degree neither tree nor shrub is to be found, while savages are met with 300 leagues beyond that elevation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His work stirred tremendous controversy in its time and provoked responses from the leading American citizens. An "Anti-Degeneracy" campaign against the assertions of de Pauw and his colleagues involved such notables such [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=jeffersons-moose-thomass-fauna-figh-11-01-26|title=Jefferson's Moose: Thomas's Fauna Fight against European Naturalists|author=Steve Mirsky|work=scientificamerican.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a renowned scholar, he corresponded with the major ''[[philosophe]]s'' of his time - including [[Voltaire]] -, and was asked to contribute articles to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. He was the uncle of [[Anacharsis Cloots]], to whom he was also a teacher.

De Pauw died in [[Xanten]]. [[Napoleon I of France]] had an obelisk raised in his memory in Xanten.

==Criticism==
De Pauw and his ideas were objects of severe criticism by some of his contemporaries, notably those with experience of the Americas. The Mexican [[society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Francisco Javier Clavijero]], exiled in Bologna, attached a series of "Dissertations" to his ''Storia antica del Messico'' with de Pauw "the principal target of my shots."  In his history of the rise and fall of the Aztec empire, Clavijero ("Francesco Saverio Clavigero") of course dealt with the Mesoamerican calendar system, and in the "Dissertations" he quoted de Pauw's remarks shown above, pointing to the many scholars, European and Indian, who had described the calendar previously. He also showed how to count up to forty-eight million in [[Nahuatl]], listed a number of Nahuatl words for metaphysical and moral concepts, pointed out that the [[Gospels]] and [[Thomas a Kempis]]'s ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' had been translated into Nahuatl, acknowledged his debt to Indian writers such as [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl|Ixtlilxochitl]], and catalogued authors both European and American born who had written in American languages ranging from [[Tarahumara]] to [[Kaqchikel language|Cakchiquel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francisco Javier Clavijero]], ''Historia antigua de Mexico'', 8th edition, Editorial Porrua, Mexico City, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another Jesuit exile in Italy, the Chilean [[Juan Ignacio Molina]], accused de Pauw of ''"always attempting to degrade and discredit the Americas"''. Some of de Pauw's statements on the poor aspects of the mineral wealth of the Americas were countered by Molina along with his claims about the shorter lives of their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;ENSAYO SOBRE LA HISTORIA NATURAL DE CHILE. [[Juan Ignacio Molina]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crustumerium''' (or '''Crustuminum''') was an ancient town of [[Latium]], on the edge of the [[Sabine]] territory, near the headwaters of the [[Allia]], not far from the [[Tiber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/422914 |title=Places: 422914 (Crustumerium) |author1=Quilici, L. |author2=S. Quilici |author3=Gigli, DARMC |author4=R. Talbert |author5=S. Gillies |author6=T. Elliott |author7=J. Becker |accessdate=March 14, 2013 &lt;!-- 5:10 pm --&gt;  |publisher=Pleiades}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome's early semi-legendary history, the Crustumini were amongst the peoples which attended [[Romulus|Romulus']] festival of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune Equester]]. At that festival, the Roman men seized the young women amongst the visiting spectators, an event known as the [[Rape of the Sabine Women]]. Afterwards, according to [[Livy]], the Crustumini commenced hostilities. The Romans retaliated and captured Crustumerium. A Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] was subsequently sent to the town by Romulus and many citizens of the town migrated to Rome. More of the Roman colonists preferred to go to Crustumerium than to another town, [[Antemnae]], because of the fertility of the soil at the former.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a1 1:9-11]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Livy]], the town later revolted to become part of the [[Latin League]], which went to war with [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] during the reign of Rome's king [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]]. Crustumerium was one of a number of towns captured by Tarquinius.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a38 1:38]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was conquered in 500 BC according to Livy (ii. 19), the tribus Crustumina or Clustumina being formed in 471 BC.

Livy records that in 468 BC [[Roman–Sabine_wars#Conflict_in_470-468_BC|the Sabines marched]] through the territory of Crustumerium towards Latium, ravaging the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe condita (book)|Ab Urbe condita]]'', ii.64&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] mentions it among the lost cities of Latium, but the name clung to the district, the fertility of which remained famous. The site of Crustumerium has been identified in the locality Marcigliana Vecchia, north to modern [[Rome]] along the [[Via Salaria]], not far from [[Settebagni]]; only partially excavated, it covered an area of some 60 hectares.

Since the site of the city was identified in the 1970s, an archaeological project has been undertaken.  In 2010 the Groningen Institute of Archaeology (GIA) received funding of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) to elaborate their research on the Iron Age settlement of Crustumerium. The aim of this website is to provide you with information on this project called "The People and the State. Material culture, social structure and political centralization in central Italy (800 - 450 BC)". &lt;ref&gt;http://www.crustumerium.nl/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DistritosMalta.PNG|thumb|Districts of Malta]]
[[Malta]] is subdivided in districts of localities in order to administer the country in regions rather than locality. The districts have no administrative significance as the [[Local councils of Malta|local councils]] provide the first-tier divisions of the country.

==Statistical districts and regions==
There are 6 districts, used for statistical purposes and which are, in turn, grouped into 3 [[Regions of Malta|regions]]: [[Gozo Region|Gozo]], [[Malta Majjistral]] and [[Malta Xlokk]]. Each district consists of a number of [[Local councils of Malta|localities]].

'''Edward Robinson''' (April 10, 1794 – January 27, 1863) was an [[United States|American]] [[Biblical studies|biblical scholar]]. He studied in the [[Religion in the United States|United States]] and [[Religion in Germany|Germany]], a center of biblical scholarship and exploration of the Bible as history. He translated scriptural works from classical languages, as well as German translations. His ''Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament'' (1836; last revision, 1850) became a standard authority in the United States, and was reprinted several times in Great Britain.

His magnum opus, ''[[Biblical Researches in Palestine]]'', the first major work in [[Biblical Geography]] and [[Biblical Archaeology]] and conducted in the [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman-ruled]] [[Palestine region]] in the late 1830s and 1850s, earned him the epithets "Father of Biblical Geography" and "Founder of Modern Palestinology."&lt;ref name="Pritchard"&gt;{{cite book |title=Archeology and the Old Testament |pages=57–58 |author=James B. Pritchard |lccn=58010053 |year=1958 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Robinson was born in [[Southington, Connecticut]], and raised on a farm. His father was a minister in the [[Congregational Church]] of the town for four decades. The younger Robinson taught at schools in [[East Haven, Connecticut|East Haven]] and [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] in 1810–11 to earn money for college. He attended [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton, New York]], where his maternal uncle, Seth Norton, was a professor.&lt;ref name=appletons&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Robinson, Edward|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1816.

In 1821 he went to [[Andover, Massachusetts]], where he published his translation of books i–ix, xviii and xix of the ''[[Iliad]]''. There he aided [[Moses Stuart]] in the preparation of the second edition (1823) of the latter's ''Hebrew Grammar.'' He translated into English (1825) Wahl's ''Clavis Philologica Novi Testamenti''.

Robinson went to Europe to study ancient languages, largely in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Berlin]] (1826–30). While in Halle, in 1828 he married the German writer [[Therese Albertine Luise Robinson|Therese Albertine Luise]]. After the couple returned to the [[United States]], Robinson was appointed professor extraordinary of sacred literature at [[Andover Theological Seminary]] (1830–33).&lt;ref name=amer&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Robinson, Edward (scholar) |year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson founded the ''Biblical Repository'' (1831), which he edited for four years.&lt;ref name=appletons/&gt; He also established the ''[[Bibliotheca Sacra]]'' (1843), into which was merged the ''Biblical Repository''. He spent three years in Boston working on a lexicon of scriptural Greek.&lt;ref name=appletons/&gt;

Illness caused him to move to [[New York City]]. He was appointed as professor of biblical literature at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]], serving from 1837 until his death.

==Exploration of Palestine==
[[Image:RobinsonsArchMay2009.jpg|thumb|Robinson's arch, on the south-western flank of the Temple Mount, once supported a staircase which led to the temple.]]
In 1836 Robinson published both a translation of [[Wilhelm Gesenius]]' ''Hebrew Lexicon'' and a Greek New Testament Lexicon.

Robinson traveled to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1838 in the company of [[Eli Smith|Rev. Eli Smith]]. He published ''Biblical Researches in Palestine'' in 1841, for which he was awarded the Gold Medal of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1842.&lt;ref name="Pritchard" /&gt; He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1847.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter R|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterR.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson, together with Smith, made scores of identifications of ancient places referred to the Bible.&lt;ref name="Pritchard" /&gt; His work established his enduring reputation as a "Founder" of Biblical archeology, and influenced much of future archaeological field work. Examples of his finds in [[Jerusalem]] include the [[Siloam tunnel]] and [[Robinson's Arch]] in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]]; the latter was named in his honor.

The two men returned to Ottoman Palestine in 1852 for further investigations. In 1856 the enlarged edition of ''Biblical Researches'' was published simultaneously in English and German. Among those who later acknowledged Robinson’s stature, in 1941 G. Ernest Wright, reviewing the pioneering survey contained in [[Nelson Glueck]]'s ''The Other Side of the Jordan'', makes a just comparison and fitting testimonial: "Glueck's explorations are second to none, unless it is those of Edward Robinson." &lt;ref&gt;Quoted in T.W. Davis (2004). ''Shifting Sands: The Rise and Fall of Biblical Archaeology'', Oxford and NY: Oxford University Press. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eskimo Point''' ({{coord|74|17|S|162|33|E|}}) is a flat-topped, steep-sided promontory which protrudes from the east side of [[Eisenhower Range]] and forms the north wall of [[O'Kane Canyon]], in [[Victoria Land]]. 

So named by the [[Southern Party]] of [[New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition]] (NZGSAE), 1962-63, which camped on its upper surface and built an igloo while waiting for white-out conditions to lift.

An effectively designed [[map]] is one in which the intended message is clearly communicated to the map user. By employing the concept of [[figure–ground (perception)|figure–ground]], a viewer can easily distinguish between the main figure on a map and the background information. Several concepts that are key to developing good figure–ground in any cartographic design are '''differentiation''', '''closed form''', '''centrality''', '''articulation''' and '''good contour'''. In addition, by considering the intended intellectual hierarchy, or the order of importance of each map element, the author can develop a [[visual hierarchy]] on the map that corresponds appropriately.

==Figure–ground cartographic elements==

'''Differentiation''' is described as the ability to easily discriminate the main figure from the ground. This can be accomplished by designing the desired figure as visually heterogeneous and reducing the level of distraction caused by the ground. By adding surface patterns or textures to the figure, visual differentiation will lead to figure definition.&lt;ref name="Dent"&gt;Borden D. Dent, 1972, "Visual organization and thematic map design", ''Annals of the Association for American Geographers'', p. 79-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Incorporation of '''closure''' on a map is important because percipients interpret the figure to be the object or objects in the map that are closed.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Robinson ''et al.'', Elements of Cartography, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is a tendency for the percipient to complete or close unfinished objects. The location and shape of central figures on a map can be adjusted by varying the scale, projection, and format.&lt;ref name="Dent"/&gt;

The figure of emphasis should be '''centrally located''' and surrounded by areas of a different character with contrast that lessens ground importance visually and emphasized the main figure. Both alignment and centering can be achieved through measurement or through visual approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Terry A. Slocum, Robert B. McMaster, Fritz C. Kessler, and Hugh H. Howard, 2005, ''Thematic Cartography and Geographic Visualization'', 2nd ed., Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of centrality is important because the object located in the center of a map is most often assumed to be the figure. Other map elements can be centered in the remaining visual space after the figure has been centered.

'''Articulation''' utilizes texture to differentiate figure from ground. One common example of using articulation on a map is differentiating a [[continent]] from the [[ocean]]. The ocean, in most cases, will be the ground and the continent will be the figure.&lt;ref name="Dent"/&gt; By adding fine-textured shading to water, the continent pops out visually as the figure.&lt;ref&gt;G. Head, 1972, "Land-water differentiation in black and white cartography", ''The Canadian Cartographer'', vol. 9, no. 1, p. 25-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Another method that can be employed for articulation is called vignetting, or the inclusion of brightness gradients at the land-water edge.

'''Good contour''' on the map can be described as the viewer’s ability to continue the line throughout the map. The figure is formed by a contour or outline (as opposed to an isometric [[contour line]]), the common boundary between the figure and ground, usually through a brightness contrast.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan MacEachren]] and T.A. Mistrick, "The role of brightness differences in figure–ground: is darker figure?", ''The Cartographic Journal'', 29:91-100, December 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; If a figure is not separated entirely from the ground, a simple black contour line can be drawn around the figure enclosing it and thus differentiating it from the ground.&lt;ref name="Dent"/&gt;

'''Intellectual hierarchy''', also known as a scale of concepts,&lt;ref&gt;Mark Monmonier, 1993, ''Mapping it Out: Expository Cartography for the Humanities and Social Sciences'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the idea that some map features are more important than others. The placement on a map or the ordering of information will convey relative importance of map features to the percipient. If developed on the map correctly, the intellectual hierarchy will correspond to the visual hierarchy established on the map. By developing a visual hierarchy, the percipient can distinguish relative importance to map objects, drawing attention to the most important objects first. By emphasizing the colors of important figures and fading out the colors on less important figures, the perceived distance between the two is increased. Also by employing color contrasts, contour sharpness can be adjusted.&lt;ref name="Dent"/&gt;

==Research in figure–ground relationships==

Fields other than cartography, such as [[psychology]], [[neurology]], and [[computer science]], have studied differentiation of figure from ground. Many studies have employed different experiments, varying the shades, textures, and orientations of test pictures to determine the best method for figure–ground design with mixed results. A current application of figure–ground research is the development of [[computer vision]] for [[robot]]s. By studying the way humans perceive figure and ground, methods can be developed to improve [[computer vision]] algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nordlund, 1998, ''[http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:8352/FULLTEXT01.pdf Figure–ground segmentation using multiple cues]'', Doctoral Dissertation, Department of Numerical Science and Computing Science, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5514">'''Geographical features''' are naturally-created features of the Earth. Natural geographical features consist of [[landform]]s and [[ecosystem]]s. For example, terrain types,  physical factors of the environment) are natural geographical features. Conversely, [[human settlement]]s or other engineered forms are considered types of artificial geographical features.

==Natural geographical features==
===Ecosystems ===
{{main|Ecosystem}}
There are two different terms to describe habitats: ecosystem and biome. An ecosystem is a community of organisms interacting with its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odum|first1=Eugene P.|authorlink1=Eugene Odum|last2=Odum|first2=Howard T.|authorlink2=Howard Thomas Odum|title=Fundamentals of Ecology|date=1971|publisher=[[Saunders (imprint)|Saunders]]|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[biomes]] occupy large areas of the globe and often encompass many different kinds of geographical features, including [[mountain range]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Botkin|first1=Daniel B.|last2=Keller|first2=Edward A.|title=Environmental Science: Earth as a Living Planet|date=1995|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotic diversity within an ecosystem is the variability among living organisms from all sources, including ''[[inter alia]]'', terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention Text — Article 2. Use of Terms|url=https://www.cbd.int/convention/articles/default.shtml?a=cbd-02|website=www.CBD.int|publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Living organism]]s are continually engaged in a set of relationships with every other element constituting  the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which they exist, and ecosystem describes any situation where there is relationship between organisms and their environment.

Biomes represent large areas of ecologically similar [[Community (ecology)|communities]] of [[plants]], [[animals]], and soil organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Basak|first1=Anindita|title=Environmental Studies|date=2009|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|isbn=978-81-317-2118-6|page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yElrhPSIq-wC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5kosDjw1GB&amp;sig=sEgYEQI_FrGmo8FSbGx2PrjlT_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=%22geographically-defined%20area%20of%20ecologically%20similar%20communities%20of%20plants%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomes are defined based on factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike [[ecozones]], biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of [[ecological succession]] and [[climax vegetation]].

== Landforms ==
{{main|Landform}}
A landform comprises a [[geomorphology|geomorphological]] unit and is largely defined by its surface form and location in the landscape, as part of the [[terrain]], and as such is typically an element of [[topography]].  Landforms are categorized by features such as elevation, slope, orientation, [[stratum|stratification]], rock exposure, and soil type. They include [[berm]]s, mounds, hills, [[cliffs]], [[valleys]], [[rivers]], and numerous other elements.  [[Oceans]] and [[continents]] are the highest-order landforms.

A '''body of water''' is any significant accumulation of water, usually covering the Earth. The term "body of water" most often refers to [[ocean]]s, [[sea]]s, and [[lake]]s, but it may also include smaller pools of water such as [[pond]]s, [[creek (tidal)|creeks]] or [[wetland]]s. [[River]]s, [[stream]]s, [[canal]]s, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are not always considered bodies of water, but they are included as geographical formations featuring water.

== Artificial geographical features ==
=== Settlement ===
{{main|Human settlement}}
A settlement is a permanent or temporary [[community]] in which people live. Settlements range in components from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding urbanized areas. Other landscape features such as roads, enclosures, field systems, boundary banks and ditches, ponds, parks and woods, mills, manor houses, moats, and churches may be considered part of a settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSRG Policy Statement|url=http://medieval-settlement.com/about/policy/|website=Medieval-Settlement.com|publisher=Medieval Settlement Research Group|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineered constructs ===
{{main|Construction engineering|Building|Nonbuilding structure}}
{{See also|Infrastructure}}
Engineered geographic features include [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[airport]]s, [[railroad]]s, [[building]]s, [[dam]]s, and [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]], and are part of the [[anthroposphere]] because they are man-made geographic features.

== Cartographic features ==
{{main|Cartography|Map}}
Cartographic features are types of abstract geographical features, which appear on maps but not on the planet itself, even though they are located on the planet. For example, the [[Equator]] is shown on maps of the Earth, but it does not physically exist. It is a theoretical line used for reference, navigation, and measurement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4363">'''Global Maritime Situational Awareness''' ('''GMSA''') is defined in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111004213300/http://www.gmsa.gov/twiki/bin/view/Main/MDAConOps U.S. National Concept of Operations for Maritime Domain Awareness, December 2007], as "the comprehensive fusion of data from every agency and by every nation to improve knowledge of the maritime domain." It is an integral element of [[Maritime Domain Awareness|Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA)]].

Essentially, no one country, department, or agency holds all of the authorities and capabilities to have effective Maritime Domain Awareness on its own. However, by combining separate pieces of information from agencies at the federal, state, local, and tribal level around the world with information from the maritime industry and other non-governmental organizations, it is possible to keep track of the status of every ocean-bound and sea-bound vessel. GMSA results from combining intelligence given by other regions of the world into a complete picture for identifying trends and detecting anomalies.

== Development of GMSA in the U.S. ==
In the United States, the director for GMSA is responsible for managing data critical to building the situational awareness component of global MDA. The director also develops and recommends policy guidance for coordinated collection, fusion, analysis, and dissemination of GMSA information and products, as well as information integration policies, protocols and standards. The director also recommends improvements to situational
awareness-related activities supporting maritime information collection, fusion, analysis and
dissemination. The director co-chairs the U.S. National MDA Stakeholder Board, sits on the MDA Stakeholder Board Executive Steering Committee, and is a member of the U.S. Maritime Security Policy Coordinating Committee (MSPCC).

The GMSA staff consists of and is supported by dedicated subject matter experts from across the federal government as selected by the Director from departmental nominees from the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[Director of National Intelligence]], [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]], [[Department Of Commerce|Department of Commerce]], [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], and [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy's]] [[National Nuclear Security Administration]].

==Maritime anomaly detection==
Maritime anomaly detection is an area of scientific study aimed at avoiding maritime collisions. There are a number of aspects to this work, and there have been several conferences and workshops exploring the domain. A google search on "Maritime anomaly detection" returns a large number of hits from a wide range of domains. Some of the related topics are:
*Maritime anomaly detection and situation awareness
*Maritime anomaly detection and [[threat assessment]]
*Visual analytics for maritime anomaly detection 
Some of the significant events exploring the area are:
*The International Workshop on Maritime Anomaly Detection - MAD 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://mad.uvt.nl/ The International Workshop on Maritime Anomaly Detection] (MAD 2011), Tilburg, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grauspitz''' (''Vorder Grauspitze'' or ''Vorder Grauspitz'' on some maps) is a [[mountain]] in the [[Rätikon]] range of the [[Alps]], located on the border between [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Switzerland]]. With an elevation of 2,599 metres above sea level, the Grauspitz is the highest mountain in Liechtenstein. It is also the highest summit of the Rätikon range west of the [[Schesaplana]] massif.

The mountain lies between the valleys of Lawenatal (municipality of [[Triesen]]) on the north and the Fläscher Tal (canton of [[Graubünden]],  municipality of [[Fläsch]]) on the south. Both sides of the Grauspitz are in the basin of the [[Rhine]], which flows approximately seven kilometres west of the mountain.

The easiest route to the summit ascends over the [[Hinter Grauspitz]] (Schwarzhorn), and along a class 3–4 razor ridge.

'''Heinrich Theodor Menke''' (24 May 1819 – 14 May 1892) was a German [[geographer]], who was born and lived in [[Bremen]]. He is remembered for his work in [[historical geography]].

Menke studied [[theology]] and [[philology]] at the [[University of Bonn]], and in 1842 received his doctorate at [[University of Halle|Halle]] with a dissertation on ancient [[Lydia]]. Afterwards he worked as a schoolteacher in Bremen, but soon became dissatisfied with this line of work, and undertook legal studies in [[Berlin]] and [[Heidelberg]]. After attaining his degree he practiced law in [[Bremen]], and later [[Vegesack]].

Throughout his life, Menke had an avid interest in [[geography]], and via contact with Wilhelm Perthes (1783–1853) of the ''[[Justus Perthes|Justus Perthes Geographische Anstalt]]'' in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], in the centre of Germany, his primary vocational focus turned to editing and producing geographical atlases. In 1865 he published the third edition of [[Karl Spruner von Merz]]' ''Atlas Antiquus'', and later produced the heavily revised third edition of Spruner's atlas of [[medieval history|medieval]] and modern history, ''Hand-Atlas für die Geschichte des Mittelalters und der neueren Zeit'' (1871–1880). Menke, a corresponding member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] since 1877,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badw.de/de/akademie/mitglieder/historisch/mitglied/index.html?per-id=2003 Heinrich Theodor Menke] Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Verstorbene Mitglieder {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; died in Gotha on 14 May 1892.

The island group [[Menkeøyane]] in the [[Svalbard]] archipelago is named in his honor.

'''Henri Hauser''' (19 July 1866 – 27 May 1946) was a French  [[historian]], [[geographer]], and [[economist]]. A pioneer in the study of the [[economic history]] of the [[early modern period]], he also wrote on contemporary economic issues and held the first chair in economic history to be established at a French university.&lt;ref name = "Boer"&gt;Boer, Pim den (2014).

Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|1400864844}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Oran]] into a middle-class Jewish family who had moved to [[French Algeria]] for health reasons but returned to France when Hauser was four years old. Hauser was educated at the [[Lycée Condorcet]] in Paris and then at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] where he came first in both the entrance and leaving examinations. He initially taught in provincial lycées before taking his doctorate in 1892 with a thesis on the 16th-century [[Huguenot]] leader, [[François de la Noue]].&lt;ref name = "Davis"&gt;Davis, Natalie Zemon (2006).

His 1905 book ''L'impérialisme américain'' predicted the decline of Europe and the dominance of the United States, while his 1915 ''Méthodes allemandes d'expansion économique'' analyzed the role played by German industry in the outbreak of World War I.&lt;ref name = "EJ" /&gt; Hauser was awarded the [[Legion of Honor]] in 1919 and in 1945 the [[Académie française]] awarded him the ''Prix de l'Académie'' for his life's work.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Hauser was born into a Jewish family of [[Republicanism|republican]] sympathies. His father Auguste Hauser (1816–1884) had been a [[Freemason]] and was a tailor by trade. His mother, Zélia Hauser ''née'' Aron (1840–1879), was the daughter of a prosperous merchant and exporter in  [[Besancon]]. Although both of Hauser's parents were born in Besancon, their families' origins were in [[Luemschwiller]] in the [[Alsace|Alsace region]]. Henri and his elder brother Félix-Paul were born in [[Oran]] in French Algeria where the family had relocated to improve Zélia's health and where Auguste had a tailor shop. The family returned to France when Henri was four years old, on the eve of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. After a short stay in [[Marseille]], they settled in [[Seine-Saint-Denis]] near Paris where Auguste resumed his trade as a tailor. Hauser's mother Zélia died of tuberculosis when he was thirteen. His maternal uncle, [[Henry Aron]], then looked after the education of Henri and Félix-Paul. He enrolled Henri in the [[Lycée Condorcet]] to prepare him for eventual study at the [[École Normale Supérieure]].&lt;ref name = "Davis" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hauser 1" /&gt;

Hauser entered the École Normale Supérieure in August 1885. One of his mentors there was the geographer [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] who would be a lifelong influence on him. Upon his graduation from the École in 1888 when he came first in the ''[[Agrégation]]'' examinations for history and geography, Hauser received a teaching appointment at the lycée in [[Bourges]]. He subsequently taught at the lycées of [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] and [[Poitiers]] before receiving his doctorate in 1892 from the ''Faculté des lettres de Paris'' ([[University of France]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gerbod, Paul (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vw2rs2Eh7hAC&amp;pg=PP11&amp;lpg=PP11 "Henri Hauser, Enseignant"], pp. 25–40 in Séverine-Antigone Marin and Georges-Henri Soutou (eds.), ''Henri Hauser (1866–1946): humaniste, historien, républicain''. Presses de l'Université de Paris-Sorbonne. {{ISBN|284050457X}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral dissertation, supervised by [[Gabriel Monod]], was on the 16th-century [[Huguenot]] leader, [[François de la Noue]]. It was published by [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] that same year and reviewed by [[Jean Réville]] in the ''Revue de l'histoire des religions''. Réville noted the dissertation's erudition and the new light shed on de la Noue's reputation by Hauser's study.&lt;ref&gt;Réville, Jean (1892). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23660210  "Chronique"].

===Academic career===

Hauser's first university appointment was as a [[lecturer]] (''chargé de cours'') in ancient and medieval history at the [[Blaise Pascal University|University of Clermont-Ferrand]] in 1893. There he published several studies which continued to shed new light on the religious and economic history of the 16th century, including ''Voyage du Levant''. Hauser had discovered [[Philippe Canaye]]'s hitherto unpublished account of his 1573 voyage to Constantinople in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. He translated the Italian manuscript and published it in 1897 with extensive notes and a biography of Canaye which corrected many errors in previous accounts of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gabriel Monod|Monod, Gabriel]] and [[André Lichtenberger|Lichtenberger, André]] (1897) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40939741 "France"]. ''Revue Historique'', Vol. 65, No. 2, pp. 337–338. Retrieved via [[JSTOR]] 28 January 2016 {{subscription}} {{fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hauser was promoted to Professor of History at Clermont-Ferrand in 1896 and remained at the university until 1899 when the [[Dreyfus Affair]] made his position untenable. During that year he established a section of the ''[[Human Rights League (France)|Ligue des droits de l'homme]]'' at  Clermont-Ferrand and gave a series of public lectures attacking the conviction of Dreyfus for treason as "illegal". Hauser wrote, "I want a France great and noble, a France faithful to its mission of justice and truth." Antisemitic students at the university and the right-wing press attacked him as  a "traitor" and a "Prussian".&lt;ref name = "Davis" /&gt;

Hauser took a leave of absence from Clermont-Ferrand, moved back to Paris with his wife Thérèse and their young daughter Alice and threw himself into writing teaching manuals for geography and comparative studies on the teaching of geography and economics in the French colonies.&lt;ref name = "Davis" /&gt; One of his more eclectic works from this period was his 1901 ''L'Or'', a book on gold in all its aspects including its extraction, metallurgy, the regions in which it is mined, and its use in both industry and commerce. The following year it was awarded the ''[[Montyon Prizes|Prix Montyon]]''.&lt;ref name ="AF2" /&gt;  In 1901, Hauser was offered an appointment to the [[University of Burgundy|University of Dijon]] and taught there until 1919 as Professor of Modern History. He also taught commercial and industrial geography at the [[Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers]] from 1915 to 1933, first as a lecturer and then as a professor. In 1919 he received his first appointment to the [[University of Paris]]. He began there as a lecturer in modern economic history, was promoted to professor ''sans chaire''{{efn|''Professeur sans chaire'' was an academic category created by the French government in 1920 and no longer in existence.

According to cultural historian Pim den Boer, Hauser was "exceptionally knowledgeable about a wide range of subjects" which was reflected in his scholarship. Throughout his career Hauser's approach was a multidisciplinary one and emphasized the roles played by both economics and geography in historical scholarship, views expressed as early as his 1903 ''L'enseignement des sciences sociales'' and his influential 1906 essay "La Géographie humaine et l'histoire économique".&lt;ref name = "Boer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darby, Henry Clifford (2002).

During World War I Hauser worked as an advisor to [[Étienne Clémentel]], France's [[Minister of Commerce (France)|Minister of Commerce]] and later sat on the economic committee at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Drouot, Henri (1946).

Henri Hauser and [[Henri Hitier]] co-directed a major inquiry into French manufacturing in 1915–16 for the National Association of Economic Expansion. The inquiry was supervised by [[Paul de Rousiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Paul de Rousiers, sociologue et praticien du syndicalisme|language=fr|page=77 |last=Savoye |first=Antoine|journal=Cahiers Georges Sorel |year=1988|volume=6  |issue=1|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/mcm_0755-8287_1988_num_6_1_959}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hauser's ''Méthodes allemandes d'expansion économique'' in which he analyzed the role played by German industry in the outbreak of the war had been published in 1915. The book was translated into English by Manfred Emanuel and Hauser and was published in London in 1917 and New  York in 1918 as ''Germany's Commercial Grip on the World''. The American edition came out as Germany's defeat seemed imminent and the [[Allies of World War I|allied powers]] were contemplating the terms of an eventual peace treaty. In his preface to that edition [[James Laurence Laughlin]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know of no other available authority who has so fully and so intelligently explained the methods by which Germany has gained her remarkable position in the markets of the world. [...] This volume is as necessary to us as to the French.&lt;ref&gt;Laughlin, James Laurence (1918)."Preface to the American Edition" in Hauser, Henri. ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008636114 Germany's Commercial Grip on the World]'', p. v. Scribner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After World War I ended, Hauser returned to his primary specialty, the history of the [[early modern period]], but continued to publish on many contemporary historical, economic and geographical subjects. According to den Boer, one of Hauser's finest historical works from this period was his 1933 ''La prépondérance espagnole (1559-1660)'' which he characterised as "rightly considered a masterly and original synthesis." It echoes the view of [[Augustin Renaudet]] in a paper read at a meeting of the ''Société d'Histoire Moderne'' shortly after Hauser's death.&lt;ref name = "Renaudet" /&gt; ''La prépondérance espagnole'' had multiple editions and was reprinted in 1973 with an introduction and eulogy to Hauser by [[Pierre Chaunu]].&lt;ref name = "Boer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|688394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[interwar period]] Hauser had an increasingly international presence. Between 1918 and 1920, he regularly visited  [[Alfred Eckhard Zimmern|Alfred Zimmern]] in [[Oxford University]] and Zimmern was also frequently in Paris to work on the post-war diplomatic conditions. In 1923, Hauser was invited by [[Edwin Francis Gay|Edwin F. Gay]] to be an exchange professor at [[Harvard University]] where he taught an economics course and gave various lectures both at the university and in other American cities. In 1929 he was invited to give conferences and lectures at [[King's College London]] and the [[London School of Economics]] where he became one of the founder members of the [[International scientific committee on price history]] led by [[William Beveridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Demade, Julien (2018).

===Later years===
[[File:Statut des Juifs - page 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Draft of the [[Vichy laws on the status of Jews|Law on the status of Jews]] annotated by [[Petain]]]]
Hauser retired from the University of Paris in 1936 at the age of 70 with [[Marc Bloch]] succeeding him in the chair of economic history, but he continued his scholarly work and publication in the ensuing years. Amongst the works he produced after his retirement was ''La naissance du Protestantisme'' which won the 1941 ''Prix Eugène Carrière'' of the Académie française.&lt;ref name = "AF1" /&gt; The lives of both men were seriously impacted by the outbreak of World War II. Hauser came out of retirement and moved with his family to [[Rennes]] in 1939 to cover a teaching post at the university left vacant when its lecturer was drafted. Bloch left his position at the Sorbonne that same year to join the French Army.

After France's defeat by the Germans in June 1940, Bloch returned to Paris, but when the [[Vichy laws on the status of Jews]] were passed in October of that year, both he and Hauser were declared "undesirable professors". Bloch joined the [[French resistance]] in 1942 and was later imprisoned by the [[Gestapo]] and executed. Hauser remained in Rennes, now forced to wear the [[yellow badge]], and unable to teach. While there he learned that his apartment in Paris which contained his library had been completely pillaged as had his country house in [[Herblay]]. Nevertheless, he continued to publish articles in journals such as ''Revue Historique'', although his name and those of the other Jewish scholars were replaced with their initials. He also began working on his memoires.&lt;ref name = "Renaudet"&gt;[[Augustin Renaudet|Renaudet, Augustin]] (1946). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40947581  "Henri Hauser (1966–1946)"].

It was there (and despite his failing eyesight) that Hauser completed his final book, a study of the economic thought of [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]].&lt;ref name = "EJ"&gt;Schwab, George (2007).

Retrieved via [[HighBeam Research]] 11 January 2015 {{subscription}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the liberation of France in 1944 Hauser and his family moved to Montpellier, hoping to return to Paris once an apartment could be found. However, Hauser's health began to fail and he died in Montpellier on  27 May 1946, shortly before his 80th birthday. His funeral, like his wedding, was a non-religious ceremony. According to Hauser, he had lost his religious faith when preparing for his [[Bar Mitzvah]] and "everything in the synagogue seemed dead".&lt;ref name = "Davis" /&gt; In 1945 the [[Académie française]] had awarded him the ''Prix de l'Académie'' for his life's work.&lt;ref name ="AF2" /&gt;

Hauser's uncle, [[Henry Aron]], who had played a major role in his education, died in 1885, the year Hauser entered the École Normale Supérieure.

One of the professors at the university there hid the papers in his own house for the remainder of the war and was later able to return the draft to Hauser's widow.&lt;ref name = "MarinSoutou"&gt;Marin, Séverine-Antigone and Soutou, Georges-Henri (eds.), ''Henri Hauser (1866-1946): humaniste, historien, républicain'', p. 342 (editor's note).

The book is a collection of papers delivered at a two-day international colloquium on the life and work of Hauser held in January 2003 at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris.

'''ISO 3166-2:ML''' is the entry for [[Mali]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Mali, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[regions of Mali|1 district and 10 regions]]. The district [[Bamako]] is the capital of the country and has special status equal to the regions.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|ML}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Mali. The second part is either of the following:
* three letters: district
* one digit (1&amp;ndash;8): regions

The codes for the regions are assigned roughly from west to east.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

A ladies' ordinary provided a socially acceptable venue where respectable women could dine alone or with other women.

'''[[African Union]] (AU) member [[Sovereign state|states]]''' have various forms of [[government]]. The [[Constitutive Act of the African Union]] makes no provision for what type of government a member state may or must have, but [[S:Constitutive Act of the African Union#Article 30 - Suspension|Article 30]] states:
:Governments which shall come to power through unconstitutional means shall not be allowed to participate in the activities of the Union.
This clause has only been applied to [[Mauritania]] after its [[Mauritania#August 2005 military coup|2005 coup d'état]], to [[Madagascar]] as a result of the [[2009 Malagasy political crisis]] and to [[Togo]] during its political crisis in April 2005.

Several political systems of governance are represented in the AU, including stable, competitive [[democracy|democracies]] ([[Politics of Botswana|Botswana]], [[Politics of Cape Verde|Cape Verde]]), systems dominated by single parties, and even a [[failed state]] that exists in a ''[[de jure]]'' capacity ([[Politics of Somalia|Somalia]]) and a [[government in exile]] ([[Foreign relations of Western Sahara|Western Sahara]]'s [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]].)

==Monarchism and republicanism==
[[Image:African Union member states by head of state.svg|thumb|right|{{legend|#C83232|[[monarchy]]}}
{{legend|#0055D2|[[republic]]}}
{{legend|#CCCCCC|non-AU state}}]]
{{see also|Republicanism|Monarchism|Monarchies in Africa}}

At present, three sovereign [[monarchy|monarchies]] are members of the African Union: [[Eswatini]] (ruled by [[List of monarchs of Eswatini|King]] [[Mswati III of Swaziland|Mswati III]], with [[Ntombi of Swaziland|Ntombi]]), [[Lesotho]] (ruled by [[List of kings of Lesotho|King]] [[Letsie III of Lesotho|Letsie III]]), and [[Morocco]]. [[Politics of Lesotho|Lesotho]] is a [[constitutional monarchy]], in which the king or queen serves a largely ceremonial function; he no longer possesses any executive authority and is proscribed from actively participating in political initiatives. According to the [[constitution]], the leader of the majority party in the assembly automatically becomes prime minister; the monarch is hereditary, but, under the terms of the constitution which came into effect after the March 1993 election, the monarch is a "living symbol of national unity" with no executive or legislative powers; under traditional law the college of chiefs has the power to determine who is next in the line of succession, who shall serve as regent in the event that the successor is not of mature age, and may even depose the monarch. [[Politics of Eswatini|Eswatini (Swaziland)]] is an [[absolute monarchy]], currently in the process of [[democratization]]. According to current Swazi law and custom, the monarch holds supreme executive, legislative, and judicial powers. The king ("Ngwenyama") is a hereditary leader, receiving assistance from a council of ministers and a national legislature. The senior queen ("Ndlovukati") is in charge of national rituals, and acts as regent if her counterpart Ngwenyama dies and the heir has not performed royal adulthood rituals or is indisposed. If the king's mother is no longer living, one of the king's wives may act as Ndlovukati. The king has [[Constitution of Swaziland|constitutional protection]] from arrest and trial.

In several other African states there are subnational monarchs, but only a select few are vested with [[constitutional]] and\or [[legal]] powers, and therefore the majority of them are little more than traditional notables in practice. The [[Ashanti Confederacy]] in [[Ghana]] is led by [[List of rulers of Asante|Asantehene]] (King) [[Otumfuo Nana Osei Tutu II]]; the succession is decided by a series of councils of local nobles and other royal family members. [[KwaZulu-Natal]] (or Zululand) is led by the [[king of the Zulu Nation]], currently [[Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu]]. Although he does not hold any direct political power, he is provided a stipend by the [[Politics of South Africa|government of South Africa]], and holds considerable sway over more traditionalist [[Zulu people|Zulu]] people in the KwaZulu-Natal Province. Both the Asantehene and the Zulu monarch are part of complex networks of other kings and chiefs that constitutionally serve as [[traditional leader]]s of their respective countries.

Due to [[Constitution of Uganda|constitutional reform]] in Uganda in 1993, several traditional monarchies have been politically reconstituted by the government of [[Yoweri Museveni]]. These are:
*[[Ankole]]: Omugabe [[Ntare VI]]
*[[Buganda]]: [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]] [[Muwenda Mutebi II of Buganda|Muwenda Mutebi II]] and [[Nnabagereka of Buganda|Nnabagereka]] [[Queen Sylvia of Buganda|Sylvia]]
*[[Bunyoro]]: [[Omukama of Bunyoro|Omukama]] Iguru
*[[Busoga]]: [[Kyabazinga of Busoga|Kyabazinga]] [[Henry Wako Muloki]]
*[[Toro (kingdom)|Toro]]: [[Omukama of Toro|Omukama]] [[Rukidi IV of Toro|Rukidi IV]]
Elsewhere, in [[Botswana]], the kgosis (or chieftains) of the various tribes are constitutionally empowered to serve as advisors within the national legislature as members of the [[Ntlo ya Dikgosi]]. Meanwhile, in [[Nigeria]], the various [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional polities]] that currently exist are politically defined by way of the ceding of definite authority from the [[provincial government]]s, which in turn receive their powers to do so from a series of chieftaincy laws that have been legislatively created. Beyond this, residual powers are also derived by the [[Nigerian traditional rulers]] from both pre-existing [[customary law]]s and the remnants of the [[indirect rule]] policy of the [[Colonial Nigeria|colonial era]].

Historically, there have been several monarchies throughout the African continent. Since [[decolonization]], many have been abolished in favor of republics. The following African monarchies have existed in the twentieth century:
*[[King of Burundi|Kingdom of Burundi]] (abolished 1966)
*[[Central African Empire]] (abolished 1979)
*[[Congo Free State]] (annexed by [[Belgium]], 1908)
*[[King of Egypt|Kingdom of Egypt]] (abolished 1953)
*[[Emperor of Ethiopia|Empire of Ethiopia]] (abolished 1975)
*[[List of heads of state of Libya|Kingdom of Libya]] (abolished 1969)
*[[King of Rwanda|Kingdom of Rwanda]] (abolished 1961)
*[[King of Tunisia|Kingdom of Tunisia]] (abolished 1957)
*[[Sultan of Zanzibar|Sultanate of Zanzibar]] (abolished 1964, currently a constituent of the United Republic of [[Tanzania]])

Several African colonies were under the [[sovereignty]] of the King or Queen of the [[United Kingdom]]. Upon [[independence]], several states became [[Dominion]]s or [[Commonwealth realms]], sharing their head of state with the United Kingdom. All have subsequently abolished the monarchy:
*[[The Gambia (1965–1970)|The Gambia]] (abolished 1970)
*[[Dominion of Ghana|Ghana]] (abolished 1960)
*[[Kenya (1963–1964)|Kenya]] (abolished 1964)
*[[Malawi (1964–1966)|Malawi]] (abolished 1966)
*[[Mauritius (1968–1992)|Mauritius]] (abolished 1992)
*[[Federation of Nigeria|Nigeria]] (abolished 1963)
*[[Rhodesia]] (not recognized; abolished 1970)
*[[Sierra Leone (1961–1971)|Sierra Leone]] (abolished 1971)
*[[Union of South Africa]] (abolished 1961)
*[[Tanganyika]] (abolished 1962)
*[[Uganda (1962–1963)|Uganda]] (abolished 1963)
In spite of this, several African states are affiliated with the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]:
*[[Botswana]]
*[[Cameroon]]
*[[Eswatini|Eswatini (Swaziland)]]
*[[The Gambia]]
*[[Ghana]]
*[[Kenya]]
*[[Lesotho]]
*[[Malawi]]
*[[Mauritius]]
*[[Mozambique]]
*[[Namibia]]
*[[Nigeria]]
*[[Seychelles]]

There are several types of government systems in African politics:
*in an [[absolute monarchy]], the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] is a [[Monarchy|monarch]] with unlimited legal authority,
*in a [[constitutional monarchy]], the monarch is a ceremonial [[figurehead]] who has few political competences,
*in a [[presidential system]], the [[president]] is the head of state and head of government,
*in a [[semi-presidential system]], the president and the [[prime minister]] share a number of competences,
*in a [[parliamentary system]], the president is a ceremonial [[figurehead]] who has few political competences
*in a [[one-party state]], there may be theoretical or legal protection for opposition parties, but there is no legitimate chance of a candidate outside the ruling party winning an election; often there are constitutional provisions protecting one-party dominance. While no AU state is constitutionally defined as such, the following are effectively one-party states:
**[[Eritrea]] ([[People's Front for Democracy and Justice]])
**[[Western Sahara]]'s ([[Polisario Front]])
:Even in other states with elections, actual opposition may not exist. The following have been or are considered [[dominant-party system]]s:
:*[[Angola]] ([[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola - Party of Labour]])
:*[[Botswana]] ([[Botswana Democratic Party]])
:*[[Cameroon]] ([[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]])
:*[[Chad]] ([[Patriotic Salvation Movement]])
:*[[Republic of the Congo]] ([[Congolese Labour Party]])
:*[[Djibouti]] ([[People's Rally for Progress]])
:*[[Equatorial Guinea]] ([[Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea]])
:*[[Ethiopia]] ([[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]])
:*[[Gabon]] ([[Gabonese Democratic Party]])
:*[[The Gambia]] ([[Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction]])
:*[[Mozambique]] ([[Mozambican Liberation Front]])
:*[[Namibia]] ([[South-West Africa People's Organisation]])
:*[[Rwanda]] ([[Rwandese Patriotic Front]])
:*[[Seychelles]] ([[Seychelles People's Progressive Front]])
:*[[South Africa]] ([[African National Congress]])
:*[[Sudan]] ([[National Congress Party (Sudan)|National Congress Party]])
:*[[Tanzania]] ([[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]])
:*[[Zimbabwe]] ([[Zanu-PF|Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front]])
*in a [[military dictatorship]], high-ranking [[military]] officials run the state with [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] rule.

The [[politics of Africa]] have been blighted by severe problems with [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[nepotism]], [[Coup d'état|coups d'état]], and [[civil war]]. Corruption is a severe problem in much of the continent, with the vast majority of African states ranking below a five out of ten in [[Transparency International]]'s [[Corruption Perceptions Index]]. Five of the ten most corrupt governments are AU member states:
&lt;ol start="151"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Angola (2.0)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Côte d'Ivoire (1.9)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="152"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Equatorial Guinea (1.9)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="152"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nigeria (1.9)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start="158"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chad (1.7)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

The following AU states are in [[ongoing wars]], or have recently ceased hostilities:
*[[Côte d'Ivoire]]: [[Civil war in Côte d'Ivoire|Ivorian Civil War]], 2002–2011
*[[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]: [[Ituri Conflict]], since 1999, [[Second Congo War]], 1998–2002
*[[Senegal]]: [[Casamance Conflict]], since 1988

==Degree of self-governance==
{{see also|Self-governance}}
Forty-five of the African Union's member states are [[unitary state]]s, which means that most of the competences lie with the [[central government]] and only minor or local issues are within the authority of [[regional government]]s. However, four states are [[federation]]s ([[Comoros]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Sudan]]) of [[state (subnational)|state]]s or [[region]]s with equal competences, Somalia's [[Transitional Federal Parliament]] is also a federation; [[Madagascar]] has [[devolution|devolved]] certain powers to its six [[Provinces of Madagascar|provinces]]; and the United Republic of [[Tanzania]] is a [[federacy]] of [[Tanganyika]] and [[Zanzibar]], the latter of which elects its own [[List of Presidents of Zanzibar|president]] for internal affairs. Former federations and [[confederation]]s in [[Africa]] from the twentieth century include:
*[[French West Africa]] (1904–1958)
*[[French Equatorial Africa]] (1910–1960)
*[[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] (1953–1963)
*[[Mali Federation]] (1959–1960)
*[[Cameroon|Federal Republic of Cameroon]] (1961–1972)
*[[Uganda]] (1962–1967)
*[[Sénégambia Confederation]] (1982–1989)

==Legislatures==
A further distinction is the number of chambers in the national [[legislature]]; either with [[unicameralism|one]] or [[bicameralism|two]] houses. There is no clear trend towards either model {{As of|2006|lc=on}}, and there's also no real common factor which determines whether a country's legislature is unicameral or bicameral, except for the fact that federations and countries with strong regional differences or regional identities are normally bicameral to reflect the regions' interests in national [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]].

The function and form of the houses vary widely; some are directly elected, others indirectly or appointed, some have legal provisions for minority representation, based either or ethnicity, religious affiliation, or gender. In Cameroon and Malawi, there are legally two houses, but only one is functional.

There are presently 34 unicameral legislatures and 19 bicameral legislatures in among AU member states.

==Notes==
* [[Madeira]] and the [[Canary Islands]] are not considered part of Europe, whereas [[Cyprus]] is. Cyprus is often considered to be a part of both [[Asia]] and [[Europe]].
* Islands of Arctic [[Russia]] are considered part of Europe as long as they are situated west of the [[Yamal Peninsula]]. This means that the islands of [[Franz Josef Land]], [[Novaya Zemlya]] plus for example [[Kolguyev]] and [[Vaygach Island]] are considered part of Europe. Islands of [[Svalbard]] are in the same category, whereas for example islands of [[Greenland]] are considered part of [[North America]].
* The figures of [[Bolshoy Beryozovy Island|Bolshoy Berezovy]], [[Storøya]] and [[Wahlbergøya]] are rough estimates from map.

{{Main article|Arkwright}}
'''Albert Arkwright''' is a fictional character played by [[Ronnie Barker]] in the British sitcom ''[[Open All Hours]]'' who has died and passed the shop down to Granville by the first episode of ''[[Still Open All Hours]]'' in 2013. 

Albert Arkwright is a pragmatic, miserly  man with old-fashioned values, whose world seems to stop at his shop door, except for his lusting for Nurse Gladys Emmanuel ([[Lynda Baron]]), which may prompt him on occasion to wander across the road, usually with a ladder, to gain access to her bedroom window. Arkwright is a devious, and mildly dishonest character, who has many crafty tricks to try to persuade a customer to leave his store having bought at least one thing, and will avoid spending his own money at all cost. He is also very conservative about his savings, keeping some in his pocket wrapped in a fine gold chain, and some in an old, battered [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]] tin that he hides under the kitchen sink. This includes, or so he claims, coins from before 1922, when they were "solid silver". He loves money so much that the last time he spent a whole night away from the shop was in 1957, when he went to have his [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] [[Appendectomy|out]]. The till itself is old fashioned, and possesses a tight spring-clip that regularly puts Granville and his fingers in danger. Arkwright refuses to replace it because of the price of a replacement, and because it prevents people from taking his precious money. Although an avid political commentator, he has few political convictions and never sides with either the left  or  right wing, instead implying they are all useless. Arkwright does however seem fervently opposed to nationalisation, once commenting ''"My top lip went all stiff and dead, as if it had been nationalised."'' His political comments usually show no allegiances, instead making remarks like ''When Wales get home rule, do you think they'll nationalise [[Clive Jenkins]]?''

Arkwright maintains an openly polite demeanour around customers, but will often insult those who offend him in a veiled or open manner. Arkwright appears to believe in God, although he is certainly not portrayed as a religious man. Most episodes end with him on the pavement outside the shop during closing time, contemplating on the days' events. His thoughts often start with an expression like "Soon they'll only be me and thee that aren't either nationalised or a limited company."

Arkwright, like most characters in the series, is a rational, practical man, who shows no signs of any sentimentality, unlike Granville, who seems to dream away most of his days, and longs for a life away from the shop. Arkwright speaks with a stammer, which he acknowledges sometimes makes it difficult to express himself. He often makes his impediment into a joke, for example asking: ''Granville, how do you spell P-p-p-pepper? Is it 6 Ps or 7?'', Granville occasionally mocks his uncle's speech pattern (such as calling the ''"weather fore-fore-forecast"'' the "''weather twelvecast''", and referring to the "''B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-BC''" as morse code), although never in a malicious or hurtful manner. Arkwright was shocked on one occasion to find that he also appears to stutter even when thinking to himself.

As by way of background, we know that Arkwright was an [[air raid warden]] during the World War Two. 

By the time of the 2013 episode ''[[Still Open All Hours]]'' and the sequel series of the same name, Arkwright has long since died (Barker died in 2005), but almost all of his personality traits have passed onto Granville. Granville keeps a framed photograph of Arkwright in the shop's kitchen which he occasionally talks to. Several people in the town, including Granville, believe that Arkwright's ghost still haunts the shop, particularly the cash register, attributing events such as the lights switching on and off or the register randomly opening and closing to him.

{{Main article|Granville (Open All Hours)}}
'''Granville''' is a fictional character played by [[David Jason]] in the [[UK|British]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Open All Hours]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Still Open All Hours]]''.  Granville is an errand boy to his uncle and employer, [[Arkwright (Open All Hours)|Arkwright]], who is the proprietor of an old-fashioned [[Yorkshire]] [[corner shop]].

Granville was born to Arkwright's sister, who died while Granville was a young child, leaving Arkwright as his sole guardian. Granville's father's identity is not known, as his mother is implied to be a woman of loose morals, and Arkwright considers him to have likely been a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]], although it's revealed that Arkwright isn't really sure if Granville's father is actually Hungarian. Raised alone by Arkwright, Granville is often curious and engrossed in thoughts about who his father was and saddened not to have known his mother.

Although a kind provider (as long as it isn't too stressful on his wallet), Arkwright's miserly and eccentric personality makes him withdraw Granville from school and he starts helping in his uncle's shop at age eleven. The tedious routine weighs heavily on Granville, who hates getting up well before dawn in the morning and not being free until nine at night. He is poorly paid, at three pounds a week, and is made to pay for anything he helps himself to from the shop shelves, even if Arkwright gave it to him. He is curious and anxious to explore the outside world and mingle with his peers, especially girls. Granville spends most of the day dreaming of being somewhere else, or doing something else, a custom which is seen as alien in the [[working class]] [[Yorkshire]] environment. Granville seems fairly sharp and quick witted, and is often quick to make satirical jokes about Arkwright's stammer or mannerisms whilst he will often flippantly make fun at customers to their faces, all of them seemingly being too unintelligent to realise this.

Unlike his uncle who is a practical man (and a miser), Granville is a carefree man, yet is treated as if he is still a child. The series never reveals his real age, and with an obviously older actor playing younger, David Jason, in the role, its easy to assume that Granville really is much older.  Granville's mundane existence is only brightened up by the milkwoman ([[Barbara Flynn]]), the only person other than Arkwright who is awake at the same time as him in the mornings. Despite his attraction to her, she is more worldly wise than he is and likes men of the same calibre as herself, but she is generally sympathetic towards Granville, and they have kissed on several occasions.

By the time of ''Still Open All Hours'', Arkwright has long died and Granville has inherited the shop as promised by Arkwright, and has a young son, Leroy. Despite their radically different personalities and views on life, however, Granville has become a toned-down version of Arkwright in his old age, such as light-heartedly mocking Leroy over his mother's identity, and attempting to make money out of every customer who walks into the shop, even by telling fibs about certain items such as anchovy paste. At one point, Granville opens a bottle of whisky to pour a drink for a promoter, and then charges him for the whole bottle. As a tribute, Granville keeps a framed photograph of Arkwright in the kitchen. He occasionally speaks to the photo as if speaking to Arkwright, and continues to mock his late uncle's stutter as a joke.

This is a '''list of currently active [[Separatism|separatist]] movements in [[North America]]'''. Separatism includes [[autonomism]] and [[secession]]ism. What is and is not considered an autonomist or secessionist movement is sometimes contentious. Entries on this list must meet three criteria:
# They are active movements with living, active members.
# They are seeking greater autonomy or self-determination for a geographic region.
# They are the citizen/peoples of the conflict area and do not come from other countries.

Under each region listed is one or more of the following:
* ''De facto'' state: for regions with ''[[de facto]]'' autonomy from the government
* Proposed state: proposed name for a seceding [[sovereign state]]
* Proposed autonomous area: for movements toward greater [[Autonomous area|autonomy for an area]] but not outright secession
** ''De facto'' autonomous government: for governments with ''de facto'' autonomous control over a region
** Government-in-exile: for a [[Government in exile|government based outside of the region in question]], with or without control
** Political party (or parties): for [[Political party|political parties]] involved in a political system to push for autonomy or secession
** Militant organisation(s): for armed organisations (sometimes called [[Terrorism|terrorist organisations]])
** Advocacy group(s): for [[Advocacy group|non-belligerent, non-politically participatory entities]]
** [[Ethnic]]/[[ethno-religious]]/[[racial]]/[[Regionalism (politics)|regional]]/[[Religious organization|religious]] group(s)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2260">The '''National Medal of Honor Museum''' is a proposed museum to be built in [[Mount Pleasant, South Carolina]]. It is slated for completion in 2021. Proposed by the '''National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation Board''', the museum is planned to be 140 feet tall, 20 feet taller than Mount Pleasant's next tallest building. The foundation was created in 2014 and aims to raise $100 million dollars to build the museum. Designed by [[Moshe Safdie]], the building has faced much regulatory scrutiny and criticism by the Mount Pleasant Planning Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.postandcourier.com/business/medal-of-honor-museum-design-fails-to-impress-mount-pleasant/article_8f02f47c-3466-11e8-9591-fb912c11611d.html|title=Medal of Honor Museum design fails to impress Mount Pleasant council committee|last=Munday|first=Dave|date=|work=[[The Post and Courier]]|access-date=2018-04-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moultrienews.com/news/medal-of-honor-museum-plan-to-come-back-for-approval/article_cd4ce9b0-1727-11e8-8a2a-4b15339f56d5.html|title=Medal of Honor Museum plan to come back for approval in May|last=Witte|first=Sully|date=|work=Moultrie News|access-date=2018-04-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/south-carolina/articles/2018-04-03/south-carolina-town-wants-changes-in-medal-of-honor-museum|title=South Carolina Town Wants Changes in Medal of Honor Museum|last=|first=|date=|work=[[U.S. News and World Report]]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/CultureShock/archives/2018/03/27/with-final-design-for-patriots-point-medal-of-honor-museum-still-in-limbo-architect-speaks-at-charleston-museum-tomorrow|title=With final design in limbo, architect of Medal of Honor Museum speaks at Charleston Museum Wednesday|last=Hardaway|first=Connelly|work=Charleston City Paper|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pocket beach''' is usually a small beach, between two [[headlands and bays|headlands]]. In an idealized setting, there is very little or no exchange of [[sediment]] between the pocket beach and the adjacent shorelines.

Pocket beaches can be natural or artificial. Many natural pocket beaches exist throughout the world. Artificial pocket beaches are usually constructed in areas where natural beaches are fairly narrow or absent. Examples of artificial pocket beaches include over 100 such systems on [[Chesapeake Bay]] in the [[United States]], each consisting of several individual pocket beaches; the Fisher Key, [[Florida]] project constructed on a dredge spoil island originally consisting of cobble dredge material;, and the Fred Howard Park Beach that was constructed offshore of a muddy mangrove shoreline. Additionally, there have been many pocket beaches constructed in the [[Caribbean]] where resorts have been developed along rocky shorelines with minimal natural beaches.

'''Specim, Spectral Imaging Ltd''' is a European technology firm headquartered in [[Oulu]], Finland. Specim manufactures and sells imaging spectrographs, [[hyperspectral]] cameras and systems. Specim's airborne AISA [[hyperspectral imaging|hyperspectral cameras]] have been utilized for example in monitoring the environmental effects of major industrial catastrophes such as [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] and [[Red mud spill]].&lt;ref name="Kaleva Specim 2010"&gt;[http://www.kaleva.fi/uutiset/oulusta-lahtee-mittalaitteita-ympari-maailmaa/877968 Kaleva: Oulusta lähtee mittalaitteita ympäri maailmaa].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikkola 2010"&gt;Mikkola, A, (Nov 16, 2010), Kaleva, Näkyvästä näkyvää.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Specim was widely credited for its Thermal Infrared Hyperspectral Cameras, including a position as a Prism Awards finalist.&lt;ref name="Prism Awards 2010"&gt;The Prism Awards for Photonics. [http://www.photonicsprismaward.com/finalists.aspx The 2010 Finalists]&lt;/ref&gt;  The credited Specim Owl is world's first Thermal Hyperspectral Camera that can efficiently be used for outdoor surveillance and [[UAV]] applications without an external light source such as the Sun or the Moon.&lt;ref name="Frost&amp;Sullivan Specim Owl"&gt;Frost&amp;Sullivan, Technical Insights, Aerospace&amp;Defence (Feb 2011): [http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/segment-toc.pag?segid=D870-00-48-00-00&amp;ctxixpLink=FcmCtx3&amp;ctxixpLabel=FcmCtx4  World First Thermal Hyperspectral Camera for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, together with Germany’s Forschungszentrum Jülich research centre, Specim developed and thoroughly tested the novel Hyplant airborne hyperspectral sensor. This was the first airborne sensor to map the fluorescence over large areas. Since then it has been used to map various types of vegetation all over Europe and also in the USA. This project is one step in assessing feasibility of possible new [[ESA]] satellite instrument that could provide global maps of vegetation fluorescence called the Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX).&lt;ref name="ESA (2014)"&gt; ESA (2014): [http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/The_Living_Planet_Programme/Earth_Explorers/Future_missions/Glowing_plants_a_sign_of_health Glowing plants a sign of health]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terrain''' or '''relief''' (also '''[[topography|topographical]] relief''') involves the vertical and horizontal dimensions of [[land]] surface. The term [[bathymetry]] is used to describe [[underwater]] relief, while [[hypsometry]] studies terrain relative to [[sea level]]. The Latin word ''terra'' (the root of ''terrain'') means "earth."

In [[physical geography]], terrain is the lay of the land. This is usually expressed in terms of the [[elevation]], [[slope]], and orientation of terrain features. Terrain affects surface water flow and distribution. Over a large area, it can affect [[weather]] and [[climate]] patterns.

==Importance==
The understanding of terrain is critical for many reasons: 
* The terrain of a region largely determines its suitability for human settlement: flatter, alluvial plains tend to have better farming soils than steeper, rockier uplands.
* In terms of [[environmental quality]], [[agriculture]], [[hydrology]] and other interdisciplinary sciences&lt;ref name=baker2011&gt;Baker, N.T., and Capel, P.D., 2011, "Environmental factors that influence the location of crop agriculture in the conterminous United States": U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2011–5108, 72 p.&lt;/ref&gt;; understanding the terrain of an area assists the understanding of [[drainage divide|watershed boundaries]], [[drainage basin|drainage characteristics]]&lt;ref&gt;Brush, L. M. (1961). "Drainage basins, channels, and flow characteristics of selected streams in central Pennsylvania" (pp. 1-44) (United States, U.S. Department of the Interior, GEOLOGICAL SURVEY). Washington D.C.: UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE. Retrieved October 29, 2017, from https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/0282f/report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, [[drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage systems]], [[hydrogeology|groundwater systems]], [[drainage|water movement]], and impacts on [[water quality#Environmental water quality|water quality]]. Complex arrays of relief data are used as input parameters for [[hydrology transport model]]s (such as the [[SWMM]] or [[DSSAM Model]]s) to allow prediction of river [[water pollution|water quality]]. 
* Understanding terrain also supports [[soil conservation]], especially in agriculture. [[Contour ploughing]] is an established practice enabling [[sustainable agriculture]] on sloping land; it is the practice of ploughing along lines of equal elevation instead of up and down a slope.
* Terrain is [[military|militarily]] critical because it determines the ability of [[armed forces]] to take and hold areas, and move [[troop]]s and material into and through areas. An [[Military geography#Types of terrain|understanding of terrain]] is basic to both defensive and offensive strategy.
* Terrain is important in determining [[weather]] patterns. Two areas geographically close to each other may differ radically in [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] levels or timing because of elevation differences or a "[[rain shadow]]" effect.
* Precise knowledge of terrain is vital in [[aviation]], especially for low-flying routes and maneuvers ([[Terrain awareness and warning system|see terrain collision avoidance]]) and airport altitudes. Terrain will also affect range and performance of radars and terrestrial radio navigation systems. Furthermore, a hilly or mountainous terrain can strongly impact the implementation of a new [[aerodrome]] and the orientation of its runways.

==Relief==

Relief (or ''local relief'') refers specifically to the quantitative measurement of vertical elevation change in a landscape. It is the difference between maximum and minimum elevations within a given area, usually of limited extent.&lt;ref&gt;Summerfield, M.A., 1991, ''Global Geomorphology,'' Pearson, 537 p. {{ISBN|9780582301566}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relief of a landscape can change with the size of the area over which it is measured, making the definition of the scale over which it is measured very important. Because it is related to the slope of surfaces within the area of interest and to the [[Stream gradient|gradient]] of any streams present, the relief of a landscape is a useful metric in the study of the Earth's surface. Relief energy, which may be defined ''inter alia'' as "the maximum height range in a regular grid",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YzBNmiGS-7oC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=definition+of+%22relief+energy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt0Yb-8azMAhWGPBoKHVSZCeQ4ChDoAQgjMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=definition%20of%20%22relief%20energy%22&amp;f=false ''African Landscapes: Interdisciplinary Approaches''], edited by Michael Bollig, Olaf Bubenzer. Cologne: Springer, 2009, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; is essentially an indication of the ruggedness or relative height of the terrain.

==Geomorphology==
[[Geomorphology]] is in large part the study of the formation of terrain or topography. Terrain is formed by concurrent processes:
* [[Geology|Geological]] [[:Category:Geological processes|processes]]: Migration of [[tectonic plate]]s, [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[Fold (geology)|folding]], [[mountain formation]], [[volcanic]] eruptions, etc.
* [[erosion|Erosional]] [[erosion#Physical processes|processes]]: [[Glacier#Glacial geology|glacial]], [[fluvial#Fluvial processes|water]], [[Aeolian processes#wind erosion|wind]], [[weathering#Chemical weathering|chemical]] and gravitational ([[mass wasting|mass movement]]); such as [[landslide]]s, [[downhill creep]], [[Landslide classification#Flows|flows]], [[Slump (geology)|slumps]], and [[landslide classification#falls|rock falls]].
* [[Impact event|Extraterrestrial]]: [[meteorite]] [[impact crater|impacts]].

[[Tectonic]] processes such as [[Orogeny|orogenies]] and [[Tectonic uplift|uplifts]] cause land to be elevated, whereas erosional and [[weathering]] processes wear the land away by smoothing and reducing topographic features.&lt;ref&gt;Strak, V., Dominguez, S., Petit, C., Meyer, B., &amp; Loget, N. (2011). Interaction between normal fault slip and erosion on relief evolution; insights from experimental modelling. Tectonophysics, 513(1-4), 1-19. doi:10.1016/j.tecto.2011.10.005&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship of [[erosion and tectonics]] rarely (if ever) reaches equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;Gasparini, N., Bras, R., &amp; Whipple, K. (2006). Numerical modeling of non–steady-state river profile evolution using a sediment-flux-dependent incision model. Special Paper - Geological Society of America, 398, 127-141. doi:10.1130/2006.2398(08)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roe, G., Stolar, D., &amp; Willett, S. (2006). Response of a steady-state critical wedge orogen to changes in climate and tectonic forcing. Special Paper - Geological Society of America, 398, 227-239. doi:10.1130/2005.2398(13)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stolar, D., Willett, S., &amp; Roe, G. (2006). Climatic and tectonic forcing of a critical orogen. Special Paper - Geological Society of America, 398, 241-250. doi:10.1130/2006.2398(14)&lt;/ref&gt; These processes are also codependent, however the full range of their interactions is still a topic of debate.&lt;ref&gt;Wobus, C., Whipple, K., Kirby, E., Snyder, N., Johnson, J., Spyropolou, K., Sheehan, D. (2006). Tectonics from topography: Procedures, promise, and pitfalls.

Special Paper - Geological Society of America, 398, 201-225. doi:10.1130/2006.2398(12)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonnet, C., J. Malavieille, and J. Mosar (2007), Interactions between tectonics, erosion, and sedimentation during the recent evolution of the Alpine orogen: Analogue modeling insights, Tectonics, 26, TC6016, doi:10.1029/2006TC002048&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Cologne.

Northward migration of the eastern himalayan syntaxis revealed by OSL thermochronometry. Science, 353(6301), 800-804. doi:10.1126/science.aaf2637&lt;/ref&gt;

Land surface parameters are quantitative measures of various [[morphometric]] properties of a surface. The most common examples are used to derive [[slope]] or [[Aspect (geography)|aspect]] of a terrain or curvatures at each location. These measures can also be used to derive [[Hydrology|hydrological parameters]] that reflect flow/erosion processes. [[Climate|Climatic]] parameters are based on the modelling of [[solar radiation]] or air flow.

Land surface objects, or [[landform]]s, are definite physical objects (lines, points, areas) that differ from the surrounding objects. The most typical examples airlines of [[Water divide|watershed]]s, [[stream]] patterns, [[ridge]]s, [[Fall line|break-line]]s, [[stream pool|pool]]s or borders of specific landforms.

'''Thin-Dim-Kun-Ka-RA''' is a group of many little islands at [[Chaloem Chai Phatthan Canal]] in [[Bangkok]], Thailand. This area of Bangkok was constructed to be a relaxing place and a tourist attraction. There are mangrove forests and about 400 [[macaque]] monkeys and a way along the canal to walk to [[Sanamchai Park]] for go to the Kun-Ka-RA waterside market for relaxing and buy the local product after watching the macaque monkeys. There is also a monument of Kun-Ka-RA to recall the history and speech of king.

==History==

Thin-Dim in Thai means the place that lives for a long time and Kun-Ka-RA means macaque monkeys. The two words together mean the place that has macaque monkeys living for a long time. Kun-Ka-RA were a pair of macaque monkeys that hurt their hands because they use their hands to dip into coconuts and could not take their hands out until the hands rotted. Each macaque monkey received the grace from King Bhumibol and was treated by a doctor.

The '''toponymies of places in New York's Capital District''' are a varied lot, from non-[[English language|English]] languages such as [[Indigineous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and [[German language|German]] to places named for famous people or families, of either local or national fame.  Also, in the early 19th century, many places in the [[Hudson Valley]], Capital District and points west were either named or renamed after places from [[Classical Antiquity]] (e.g. Athens, Cairo, Carthage, Greece, Ilion, Ithaca, Phoenicia, Rome, Syracuse, Troy, Utica)

The government of the '''[[Republic of Abkhazia]]''', which considers itself independent from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], issues its own '''[[vehicle registration plate]]s''' for the [[motor vehicle]]s registered in the territory it controls. The design of the plates is based on that of [[Vehicle registration plates of Russia|Russian license plates]], although Abkhazian plates lack the regional coding of Russian plates.

The license plate serial format consists of a letter followed by three digits and then two more letters. The letters are [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], but only thirteen letters reminiscent of letters of the [[Latin alphabet]] are used: А, Б, В, Е, К, М, Н, О, Р, С, Т, У, and Х.

In the territory controlled by the government of Georgia (before 2008), the [[Vehicle registration plates of Georgia (country)|Georgian license plates]] were issued. Since 2004, cars with Georgian plates are prohibited in Abkhazia, as are Abkhazian plates in mainland Georgia. Cross-border travel is therefore only possible with Russian, [[Vehicle registration plates of Armenia|Armenian]], or [[Vehicle registration plates of Azerbaijan|Azeri]] plates.

The '''Vladayska''' (Владайска река, ''Vladayska reka'') is a river in western [[Bulgaria]], a tributary of the [[Perlovska]].

The river flows from the northwestern slopes of [[Cherni Vrah]] on [[Vitosha|Vitosha Mountain]], crossing [[Torfeno Branishte]] Nature Reserve, then submerging beneath [[Zlatnite Mostove|Zlatnite Mostove Stone River]], turning to the northeast at the village of [[Vladaya]] from which the river takes its name, entering  [[Sofia Valley]] via Vladaya Gorge, and crossing the city of [[Sofia]] (featuring the historical ‘Lavov most’ / ‘Lion's Bridge’ in the process) to flow into the Perlovska (a tributary of the [[Iskar (river)|Iskar]]) in its northeastern suburbs.
