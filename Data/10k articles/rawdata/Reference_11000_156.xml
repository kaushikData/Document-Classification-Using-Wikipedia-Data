[[File:Act of Restoration of Independence of Lithuania 1990-03-11.png|thumb|Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania with signatures of the delegates]]
The '''Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania''' or '''Act of March  11''' ({{lang-lt|Aktas dėl Lietuvos nepriklausomos valstybės atstatymo}}) was an independence declaration by the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]] adopted on March 11, 1990, signed by all&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lrs.lt/datos/kovo11/signatarai/ |title=LR AT AKTO Dėl Lietuvos nepriklausomos valstybės atstatymo signatarai |publisher=Lietuvos Respublikos Seimas}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of the [[Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas|Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania]] led by [[Sąjūdis]]. The act emphasized restoration and legal continuity of the [[Interwar period|interwar-period]] [[Lithuania]], which was occupied by the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and lost independence in June 1940. It was the first time that a occupied state declared independence from the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolving Soviet Union]].

==Background==

===Loss of independence===
After the [[partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 18th century, Lithuania was part of the [[Russian Empire]]. In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the [[Council of Lithuania]], chaired by [[Jonas Basanavičius]], proclaimed the [[Act of Independence of Lithuania]] on February 16, 1918. Lithuania enjoyed independence for two decades. In August 1939, the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]] signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] dividing Eastern Europe into [[spheres of influence]]. The [[Baltic states]] (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) were assigned to the Soviet sphere of influence and subsequently were [[Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1940)|occupied in June 1940]] and converted into [[soviet socialist republic]]s.

In Lithuania's case, President [[Antanas Smetona]] left the country rather than accept the occupation.  He did not resign, but turned over his presidential duties to Prime Minister [[Antanas Merkys]] as per the constitution.  The next day, Merkys declared himself president in his own right. Two days later, under Soviet pressure, he appointed [[Justas Paleckis]], a left-wing journalist and longtime opponent of the Smetona regime, as prime minister.  Merkys then resigned at Moscow's insistence, making Paleckis acting president as well. The Soviets then used the Paleckis government to give the final Soviet takeover the appearance of legality.

The Paleckis government staged [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 1940|a heavily rigged election]] for a "[[People's Seimas]]," in which voters were presented with a single Communist-dominated list. The newly-elected People's Seimas met on July 21 with only one piece of business–a resolution declaring Lithuania a Soviet republic and petitioning for admission to the Soviet Union, which carried unanimously. The Soviet Union duly "approved" the request on August 3. Since then, Soviet sources have maintained that Lithuania's petition to join the Soviet Union marked the culmination of a Lithuanian [[socialist revolution]], and thus represented the legitimate desire of the Lithuanian people to join the Soviet Union.
 
The Soviet authorities undertook [[Sovietization of the Baltic states|Sovietization]] policies: [[nationalization]] of all private property, [[collectivization]] of agriculture, suppression of the [[Catholic Church]], and imposition of totalitarian control. At the same time free education and free national health system were also introduced. The [[Lithuanian partisans|armed anti-Soviet partisans]] were liquidated by 1953. Approximately 130,000 Lithuanians, dubbed "[[enemies of the people]]", were deported into Siberia (see [[June deportation]] and [[March deportation]]). After the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, the Soviet Union adopted [[de-Stalinization]] policies and ended mass persecutions. Nonviolent resistance continued both in Lithuania and among the Lithuanian diaspora. These movements were secret, illegal, and more focused on social issues, human rights, and cultural affairs rather than political demands.

===Independence movements===
[[File:EasternBloc BasicMembersOnly.svg|thumb|250px|Map of the [[Eastern Bloc]]]]
As [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] attempted to revive the [[economy of the Soviet Union]], he introduced [[glasnost]] (''openness'') and [[perestroika]] (''restructuring'').

Gorbachev's political agenda went for great and deep changes within the Soviet government, as such, Gorbachev invited the [[soviet people|soviet public]] into open and public discussions unseen before.

For the soviet Lithuanian dissidents, and activists, it was a golden opportunity not to be missed, to bring their movements from underground into the public life.

On August 23, 1987 (48th anniversary of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]), the [[Lithuanian Liberty League]] organized the first public protest rally that did not result in arrests.

Encouraged by the non arrests, by mid-1988, a group of 35 intellectuals organized the [[Sąjūdis]] Reform Movement with the original goal of supporting, discussing, and implementing Gorbachev's reforms yet short of openly supporting independence from the [[USSR]].

However, Sąjūdis grew in popularity, attracting large crowds to rallies in [[Vingis Park]] and therefore radicalizing its agenda, taking advantage of Gorbachev's passiveness.

By 1989, Sąjūdis, not afraid of angering Moscow and causing a violent clampdown, continuously pushed further with its demands: from limited discussions on Gorbachev's reforms, to demand of greater say in economic decisions, to political autonomy within the Soviet Union.

By the time of the [[Baltic Way]], a [[human chain]] spanning over 600 kilometres (370&amp;nbsp;mi) across the three Baltic states to mark the 50th anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, full independence was the official goal of Sąjūdis.

==Democratic election==
[[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 1990|Parliamentary elections of February 1990]] were the first free and democratic elections in Lithuania since World War II. The people overwhelmingly voted for the candidates endorsed by Sąjūdis, even though the movement did not run as a political party. The result was the first post-war non-communist government. During its first assembly on March 11, 1990, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] elected [[Vytautas Landsbergis]] as its chairman, changed its name to the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania]], and formally declared the re-establishment of the State of Lithuania. The act was approved at 10:44 pm by  124 members of the council while six abstained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lrs.lt/datos/kovo11/signatarai/ |title=LR AT AKTO Dėl Lietuvos nepriklausomos valstybės atstatymo signatarai |publisher=Lietuvos Respublikos Seimas}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no votes against.

==The Act==
{{quote|
&lt;center&gt;SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

ACT

On the Re-establishment of the State of Lithuania &lt;/center&gt;
The [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania]], expressing the will of the nation, decrees and solemnly proclaims that the execution of the sovereign powers of the State of Lithuania abolished by foreign forces in 1940, is re-established, and henceforth Lithuania is again an independent state.

The [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|Act of Independence of 16 February 1918]] of the [[Council of Lithuania]] and the [[Constituent Assembly of Lithuania|Constituent Assembly]] decree of 15 May 1920 on the re-established democratic State of Lithuania never lost their legal effect and comprise the constitutional foundation of the State of Lithuania.

The territory of Lithuania is whole and indivisible, and the constitution of no other State is valid on it.

The State of Lithuania stresses its adherence to universally recognized principles of international law, recognizes the principle of inviolability of borders as formulated in the Final Act of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in [[Helsinki]] in 1975, and guarantees human, civil, and ethnic community [[Human rights|rights]].

The Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania, expressing sovereign power, by this Act begins to realize the complete sovereignty of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.lrs.lt/seimu_istorija/w3_viewer.ViewTheme-p_int_tv_id=281&amp;p_kalb_id=2&amp;p_org=0.htm  |title=Supreme Council - Reconstituent Seimas 1990 - 1992 |publisher=Lietuvos Respublikos Seimas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The Supreme Council took the line that Lithuania's original declaration of independence in 1918 was still valid, and considered the Act to be a reassertion of an independence that still legally existed on international law. It was based on the premise that Smetona never resigned, and Merkys' takeover of the presidency was illegal and unconstitutional. Lithuania's official position on the matter since then has been that all subsequent acts leading up to the Soviet annexation were ''ipso facto'' void.

==Aftermath==
[[Image:LT-2000-50litų-Independence-b.png|thumb|Litas commemorative coin dedicated to the 10th anniversary of Independence]]
The Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania served as a model and inspiration to other [[Soviet republics]]. However, the issue of independence was not immediately settled and recognition by other countries was not certain.

[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] called the Act of Independence illegal and the USSR demanded revocation of the Act and began applying sanctions against Lithuania including an economic blockade. In addition, on January 13, 1991 Soviet forces stormed the [[Seimas Palace|Parliament building]] in Vilnius along with the [[Vilnius TV Tower]]. Unarmed civilian Lithuanians confronted Soviet soldiers. Fourteen people were killed and seven hundred injured in what became known as [[January Events]].

On May 31, 1990, the [[Supreme Soviet]] of [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian SSR]] voted to recognize the Restoration of the Independence of Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://md.mfa.lt/md/en/news/prime-minister-thanks-moldova-for-recognizing-lithuanias-independence-in-1990|title=Prime Minister thanks Moldova for recognizing Lithuania's Independence in 1990|date=January 29, 2010|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliament of Moldavia was the first in the world to recognize Lithuania's Independence, but [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavia]] was still part of the [[Soviet Union]].

On February 11, 1991, the [[Alþingi|Icelandic parliament]] voted to confirm that [[Iceland|Iceland's]] 1922 recognition of Lithuanian independence was still in full effect, as it never formally recognized the Soviet Union's control over Lithuania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Svo fIjótt sem verða má |url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=2927190 |accessdate=28 October 2018 |work=[[Þjóðviljinn]] |date=12 February 1991 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that full diplomatic relations should be established as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stjórnmálasamband verði tekið upp svo fljótt sem verða má |url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=1738122 |accessdate=28 October 2018 |work=[[Morgunblaðið]] |date=12 February 1991 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Viðurkenning á sjálfstæði í fullu gildi |url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=2581110 |accessdate=28 October 2018 |work=[[Dagblaðið Vísir]] |date=12 February 1991 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were followed by [[Denmark]], [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] (within [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) and [[Latvia]].

After the failed [[1991 Soviet coup d'etat attempt|August Coup]], Lithuanian independence recognition was reconfirmed by the [[United States]] on September 2.

President [[George H.W. Bush]] announced that if the Soviet Union were to use armed force against Lithuania, the U.S. would react accordingly.

Finally, on September 6, 1991 Lithuania's independence was recognized by the Soviet Union.

Then recognition of Lithuania's independence was quickly followed by several countries including [[China]], [[India]] and [[Belarus]] as well as [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan]].

On September 17, 1991, it was welcomed as a member of the [[United Nations]] along with Estonia and Latvia.

Since 2004, Lithuania along with Estonia and Latvia became members of the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. The country eventually [[Bans on Communist symbols|banned]] displays of Soviet and Nazi symbols in 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12208">A tradition of [[almanacs]] published for the purposes of [[North America]] began in [[New England]] in the 17th century. A [[New World|New World's]] dwelling would seldom be found without the latest print of North American almanac and [[The Pilgrim’s Progress|''The Pilgrim’s Progress'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/pilgrimsprogr1796buny |title=The Pilgrim's Progress |last=Bunyan |first=John |date=May 2, 1796 |location=London, England |website=Internet Archive |publisher=T. Heptinstall Fleet Street}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest almanac published for New England appeared in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] as early as 1639, by William Pierce. It was the second work printed in the [[Thirteen Colonies|English colonies of America]] altogether (the first being ''[[The Oath of a Free-man]]'', printed earlier in the same year).&lt;ref&gt;Burdick 2010, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=PVmcz09_UL4C&amp;pg=PA186 p. 186].&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest New England almanac of which an extant copy survives in the [[Library of Congress]]&lt;ref&gt;Burdick 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PVmcz09_UL4C&amp;pg=PA366  p. 366].&lt;/ref&gt; was published by Zechariah Brigden in Cambridge in 1659.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6DwoAQAAMAAJ  An almanack of the cœlestial motion for this present year of the Christian æra 1659: being (in our account) bissextile or leapyear, and from the creation (according to truest computation) 5608; whose vulgar notes are ... fitted to 315 degrees of longitude, the (supposed) meridian of the Massachusets Bay ... and may without any sensible errour be applyed to any part of New-England]''&lt;/ref&gt; 
Harvard College became the first center for the annual publication of almanacs with various editors including [[Samuel Danforth]], Oakes, Cheever, Chauncey, Dudley, Foster, et alia. An almanac maker going under the pseudonym of Poor Richard, Knight of the Burnt Island began to publish ''[[Poor Robin's Almanack]]'' one of the first comic almanacs that parodied these horoscopes in its 1664 issue, saying "This month we may expect to hear of the Death of some Man, Woman, or Child, either in Kent or Christendom." Other noteworthy comic almanacs include those published from 1687-1702 by John Tully of Saybrook, Connecticut. 
The ''Boston ephemeris'' was an early almanac published in [[Boston]] during the 1680s.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aDUoAQAAMAAJ  The Boston ephemeris: an almanack for the year MDCLXXXIV, and of the worlds creation 5633, oppidi inchoati, 55; being the first after leap-year, of  which the vulgar notes are ... calculated for the meridian of Boston in New-Engl. where the North Pole is elevated 42 gr. 30 m. longitude 315 gr]'',  edited by Benjamin Gillam, printed by S. Green for S. Phillips.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important early American almanacs were made from 1726-1775 by [[Nathaniel Ames]] of Dedham, Massachusetts. A few years later [[James Franklin (printer)|James Franklin]] began publishing the ''Rhode-Island Almanack'' beginning in 1728. Five years later his brother [[Benjamin Franklin]] began publishing ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' from 1733-1758. [[Benjamin Banneker]] improved on the Almanac from 1792-1797.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9390">'''''Ankang''''' ({{zh|c=安康}}) is a name shared by a number of [[psychiatric hospital]]s or asylums in [[China]]. The term literally means "''peace and health [for the mentally ill]''". Many of these institutions are prison-hospitals for holding prisoners judged to be mentally ill, and operate directly under the local [[Public Security Bureau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/china02/china0802-08.htm |title=The Ankang: China's Special Psychiatric Hospitals |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=14 December 2012 |archivedate=14 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CtXHsZl8?url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/china02/china0802-08.htm |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, "''ankang''" is sometimes used in the Western press to denote the system of prison-hospitals in China. However, not all ''ankang'' hospitals are prison-hospitals, and some offer conventional psychiatric and medical treatment services.

Some patients sent to these institutions are [[political prisoner]]s or [[Falun Gong]] practitioners. By some estimates 3,000 [[political prisoner]]s are held in about 25 ''ankang'' institutions across China.&lt;ref name="usstate2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2003/27768.htm | publisher=[[United States Department of State]] Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor | title=China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau) | date=25 February 2004 | accessdate=17 November 2008 | work= 2003 Country Reports on Human Rights Practice&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}} Section 1d: "Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile."&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of ''ankang'' hospitals==
According to the [[United States Department of State]], there were 20 ''ankang'' hospitals in China in early 2009, which are overseen by the [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=25 February 2009 | accessdate=8 May 2009 | publisher=[[United States Department of State]] | url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eap/119037.htm | title=2008 Human Rights Report: China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau) &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}} "Respect for Human Rights" Section 1c: Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading  Treatment or Punishment.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[Wang Wanxing]], a prominent democracy activist with a history of anti-government protest, was again arrested on June 4, 1992 when he unfurled a banner in Tiananmen Square on the third anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. He was swiftly arrested and locked up in a psychiatric hospital near Beijing, with a concocted diagnosis of "political monomania".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,,1671211,00.html ''In the grip of the Ankang''], [[The Guardian]], December 20, 2005&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Following his release in 2006, Wang was examined for two days by Dr. Raes and Dr. van der Meer, who said in a statement: "He was not suffering from any mental disorder that could justify his admission." Human Rights Watch says it has documented 3,000 cases of psychiatric punishment of political dissidents since the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kahn, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/17/international/asia/17china.html?_r=1&amp;oref=login Sane Chinese Put in Asylum, Doctors Find], March 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Robin J. Munro drew attention when he made allegations of abuses of forensic psychiatry in China.&lt;ref&gt;Sunny Y. Lu &amp; Viviana B. Galli, "Psychiatric Abuse of Falun Gong Practitioners in China", ''The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law'', 30:126–30, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, [[Human Rights Watch]] and the Geneva Initiative on Psychiatry issued a report which alleged that Chinese dissidents, independent labour organisers, whistle-blowers and individuals who complain about official misconduct have been labelled "political maniacs" and locked up in mental hospitals simply for opposing the government. Symptoms of "political mania" as defined by the police include "shout[ing] reactionary slogans, writ[ing] reactionary banners and reactionary letters, mak[ing] anti-government speeches in public, and express[ing] opinions on important domestic and international affairs". Such individuals may be detained indefinitely in ''ankang'' centres.&lt;ref&gt;John Gittings, [https://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,773633,00.html China 'sending dissidents to mental hospitals], ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The project began in 1947, and the first volume was later published via Stephen Austin &amp; Sons Ltd, [[Hertford]], [[Great Britain]]. Each of the fifteen volumes has approximately 500 pages. The last volume of the first edition was published in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.moi.gov.mm/ppe/?q=content/id-193]'',မြန်မာ့စွယ်စုံကျမ်းနှစ်ချုပ်&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by yearly updates.

The '''Canadian Museums Association''' ('''CMA''') is a national non-profit organization for the promotion of museums in Canada. It represents Canadian museum professionals both within Canada and internationally. As with most [[trade association]]s, it aims to improve the recognition, growth and stability of its constituency. Its staff supports their nearly 2,000 members with conferences, publications, and [[Business networking|networking]] opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museums.ca/site/about "CMA Website"]&lt;/ref&gt;

CMA members include national museums, non-profit museums, [[art galleries]], science centres, aquariums, archives, sport halls-of-fame, artist-run centres, zoos and historic sites across Canada. They range from large metropolitan galleries to small community museums. All are dedicated to preserving and presenting Canada's cultural heritage to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museums.ca/site/about "CMA Website"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1932, British Museums Association President Sir Henry Miers visited museums in Canada and found them "in a deplorable state and far behind those of the United States and most European countries."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Kathryn|date=June 1997|title=A History of the CMA|url=|journal=Muse|volume=XIV/4-XV/1|pages=25-31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to notes later left in CMA bylaws, the intention had been to form an Association in the 1930s, but was delayed due to the Second World War. 

Following the war, the idea for an Association began to gain popularity. In a 1946 letter to Alice Johannsen Turham of the McGill University Museums, Dr. Harry O. McCurry of the National Gallery of Canada explained: &lt;blockquote&gt;As you know I have always felt that a Canadian Museums Association is essential to the proper development of a Canadian museum service and I hope you feel the same way. I was astonished to hear from one prominent curator, that he thought we ought &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; to form an association of our own but to link up with the U.S.A. I am all for most cordial cooperation with the American Museums Association in every way but we need an organization of our own to deal with problems which are particularly Canadian.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Dr. H.O. McCurry to Mrs. Alice Johannsen Turham, November 29, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A small group of representatives from 13 museums met in Quebec City, QC during the 42nd Annual Meeting of the [[American Alliance of Museums|American Association of Museums]] (now the American Alliance of Museums). It was granted Charter by the Secretary of State on September 10, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Letter J.D. Herbert to Secretary of State, June 30 1947. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Founding Members and their institutions (at the time)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;:
* F.J. Alcock ([[National museums of Canada|National Museum of Canada]])
* E.C. Cross ([[Royal Ontario Museum]])
* R.E. Crouch ([[Museum London|London Public Library and Art Museum]])
* Donald K. Crowdis ([[Nova Scotia Museum|Provincial Museum of Nova Scotia]])
* J.R. Dymond (Royal Ontario Museum of Zoology)

* Dr. E.S. Moore (Royal Ontario Museum of Geology and Mineralogy) 
* W.A. Squires ([[New Brunswick Museum]])
* Alice Johannsen Turnham ([[Redpath Museum|McGill University Museums]])
In addition to the above, eight more observers were present at the founding event and are recognized as founding members (as opposed to delegates).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 1988 controversy surrounding ''The Spirit Sings'' exhibition at the Glenbow Museum led to the creation of a task force to assess and address issues of Indigenous involvement in museums, access to museum collections and the interpretation of artifacts and human remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibbons|first=Jacqueline A.|date=Winter 1997|title=The Museum as Contested Terrain: The Canadian Case|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/46716ebb7a515e7058bef28bb798de74/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=1816586|journal=The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society; Washington, D.C|volume=Vol. 26, Iss. 4,|pages=89|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, CMA, in partnership with the [[Assembly of First Nations]], published the report ''[http://museums.in1touch.org/uploaded/web/docs/Task_Force_Report_1994.pdf Turning The Page]'' with recommendations on repatriation of human remains and sacred objects to indigenous communities.

In 2015, CMA was named in Calls to Action 67 and 68 of the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to undertake special roles in the reconciliation process. 
* Call to Action #67 states: We call upon the federal government to provide funding to the Canadian Museums Association to undertake, in collaboration with Aboriginal peoples, a national review of museum policies and best practices to determine the level of compliance with the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] and to make recommendations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf|title=Calls to Action|last=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|first=|date=2015|website=Truth and Reconciliation Canada|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Call to Action #68 states: We call upon the federal government, in collaboration with Aboriginal peoples, and the Canadian Museums Association to mark the 150th anniversary of Canadian Confederation in 2017 by establishing a dedicated national funding program for commemoration projects on the theme of reconciliation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
As of 2016, CMA is in the process of launching a Museums and Indigenous Council to address these and other issues regarding Indigenous Canadians.

== Mandate==
The CMA is a federally incorporated nonprofit association which advances public museum services in Canada, promotes the welfare and a better administration of museums and fosters a continuing improvement in the qualifications and practices of museum professionals.&lt;ref&gt;A-AD-266-000/AG-001
Canadian Forces Museums –Operations and Administration 2002-04-03&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a registered charity and supports the Museums Foundation of Canada which is a separate charity.

== Governing Structure ==
The CMA is governed by an elected Board of Directors and maintains a full-service Secretariat in Ottawa. 

Since its founding, CMA has had nine Executive Directors: 
* Archie Key (1965-1967)
* N. George Shaw (1968-1969)
* S. James Gooding (acting) (1969)
* William Scott Bragg (1969-1971)
* Don Smithies (1971-1974)
* Archie Key (interim) (1974)
* Robin Inglis (1974-1979)
* Lynn Ogden (1979-1981)
* John McAvity (1981-Present)

== Services ==
CMA publishes its bilingual bimonthly Muse magazine and offers its members services such as advocacy on broad public policy, an insurance program and awards, among other services.  The Association regularly appears before Parliamentary Committees on issues of heritage.  CMA also hosts Canadian Museums Day on Parliament Hill to celebrate the contributions of museums to society.  

Since 1996, the Association administers for the Department of Canadian Heritage the Young Canada Works program which provides funds for the hiring of summer students and interns in museums in order for them to obtain experience in the heritage field. 

It also offers large national conferences each year in various locations across Canada (Ottawa 2017 and Vancouver 2018) as well as specialized conferences on museum issues, such as Museum Traveling Exhibitions, Deaccessioning Standards, Art and Law symposium, Museum Enterprises Conference, Future of Exhibition Design Symposium, etc.

[[Manusmriti|Manu Smriti]] (XII - 48) classifies the Daityas as good, yet placing them at a lower level than the Devas: "Hermits, ascetics, Brahmanas, the crowds of the Vaimanika deities, the lunar mansions, and the Daityas (form) the first (and lowest rank of the) existences caused by Goodness."

'''Daniel John Cunningham''' M.D., D.C.L., LL. D. [[Fellow of the Royal Society|F.R.S.]], [[FRSE|F.R.S.E.]] (15 April 1850 &amp;ndash; 23 July 1909) was a Scottish physician, zoologist, and anatomist, famous for ''Cunningham's Text-book of Anatomy'' and ''Cunningham's Manual of Practical Anatomy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kaufman, Matthew H.|title=Daniel John Cunningham (1850–1909)|journal=J Med Biogr|date=Feb 2008|volume=16|issue=1|pages=30–35|doi=10.1258/jmb.2006.006058|pmid=18463062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Cunningham was born in the manse at [[Crieff]], the son of Rev John Cunningham (1819-1893) and of his wife Susan Porteous Murray.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Following education at [[Crieff Academy]] he studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he attained his M.D. in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Cunningham |first=J. D. | date=1876 |title=Spinal nervous system of the cetacea: with an account of a hitherto undescribed variety of dolphin |url=https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/23828|language=en |publisher=University of Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1876 until 1882 he acted as a demonstrator for his professor at the university. From 1883 to 1903 he held the chair of Anatomy at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. From 1903 until his death he was professor of anatomy at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Obit.

He was at various times president of the [[Royal Zoological Society of Ireland]], secretary and vice-president of the [[Royal Dublin Society]] and president of the [[Anatomical Society]] (1893–95). He was elected a fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland]], the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], the [[Royal Society]] (1891) and the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25282710?sid=21105803467131&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=2 |title= Obituary-Daniel John Cunningham |accessdate = 28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

He died unexpectedly at home, 18 Grosvenor Crescent in Edinburgh's West End, on 23 July 1909 and was buried with his wife, Elizabeth, and children near the eastern side of [[Dean Cemetery]] in [[Edinburgh]], close to the [[Dean Gallery]] entrance.

His position as professor of anatomy was filled by [[Arthur Robinson (anatomist)|Arthur Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;https://livesonline.rcseng.ac.uk/biogs/E004526b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1878, he married Elizabeth Cumming Browne, eldest daughter of Rev Andrew Browne, minister of the parish of [[Beith]] in Ayrshire, and had by her three sons and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB12|wstitle=Cunningham, Daniel John |first=George Alexander|last= Gibson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His two younger sons were [[Admiral of the Fleet (United Kingdom)|Admiral of the Fleet]] [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope]], and [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] Sir [[Alan Cunningham]], both decorated veterans of [[World War II]].

His eldest son Lt Col John Cunningham MD [[FRSE]] (1882-1968) was an army physician and bacteriologist.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''design museum''' is a [[museum]] with a focus on [[Product (business)|product]], [[Industrial design|industrial]], [[graphic]], [[fashion]] and [[architectural]] design.
Many design museums were founded as museums for [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] and started only in the late 20th century to collect [[design]].

The first museum of this kind was the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]]. In [[Germany]] the first museum of decorative arts was the ''Deutsches-Gewerbe-Museum zu Berlin'' (now ''[[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin|Kunstgewerbemuseum]]''), founded in 1868 in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also some museums of [[contemporary art|contemporary]] or [[modern art]] have important design collections, like the [[MoMA]] in New York, the [[Centre Pompidou]] in [[Paris]]. 
A special concept has been realised in the Pinakothek der Moderne in [[Munich]], in which four independent museums cooperate, one of them being [[Die Neue Sammlung]] – the largest design museum in the world.

Today corporate museums like the [[Vitra Design Museum]], Museo Alessi or Museo Kartell play an important role.

'''"Design to Standards"''' means to design items with generally accepted and uniform procedures, dimensions or materials.

==Benefits==
Product standardization is a technique in engineering design that aim to reduce the number of different parts within a product. The benefits are:
* lower [[supply chain]] costs
* product platforms
* faster [[product design]]

The supply chain costs are simple to reason:
* less variety of supplier, less supplier in numbers
* less stock keeping units (SKU)
* more economics of scale
* less variety of production operations

Product platforms are enabled through:
* [[Interchangeable parts|standardized parts]] can be re-utilized across a product family
* standardized parts can be re-utilized across product generations

The product design process becomes faster because:
* standardized parts can be pulled from an engineering database
* already standardized parts do not need to be designed again

==Standards==
Standardization can occur through two ways
* [[Standardization|industry standard]] setter
* company standards

'''Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases''' is an online database developed by [[James A. Duke]] at the [[USDA]].

The databases report species, [[phytochemical]]s, and [[biological activity]], as well as [[ethnobotanical]] uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1239279 | doi=10.15482/USDA.ADC/1239279| title=Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases| year=2016| last1=Duke| first1=James A.| publisher=Ag Data Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical databases facilitate plant, chemical, bioactivity, and ethnobotany searches. A large number of plants and their chemical profiles are covered, and data are structured to support browsing and searching in several user-focused ways. For example, users can
* get a list of chemicals and activities for a specific plant of interest, using either its scientific or common name
* download a list of chemicals and their known activities in PDF or spreadsheet form
* find plants with chemicals known for a specific biological activity
* display a list of chemicals with their LD toxicity data
* find plants with potential cancer-preventing activity
* display a list of plants for a given ethnobotanical use
* find out which plants have the highest levels of a specific chemical
References to the supporting scientific publications are provided for each specific result. Also included are links to nutritional databases, plants and cancer treatments and other plant-related databases.

'''Ethnology''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἔθνος'', ''ethnos'' meaning "nation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ethno-|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ethno-?q=ethno|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the branch of [[anthropology]] that compares and analyzes the characteristics of different [[peoples]] and the relationships between them (cf. [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[social anthropology|social]], or [[sociocultural anthropology]]).&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=ethnology|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ethnology?q=ethnology|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific discipline==
{{further information|Ethnicity}}
Compared to [[ethnography]], the study of single groups through direct contact with the culture, ethnology takes the research that ethnographers have compiled and then compares and contrasts different cultures.

[[File:AFKollar 1779.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Adam František Kollár]], 1779]]
The term ''ethnologia'' (''ethnology'') is credited to [[Adam František Kollár|Adam Franz Kollár]] (1718-1783) who used and defined it in his ''Historiae ivrisqve pvblici Regni Vngariae amoenitates'' published in [[Vienna]] in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Zmago Šmitek and Božidar Jezernik, "The anthropological tradition in Slovenia." In: Han F. Vermeulen and Arturo Alvarez Roldán, eds. ''Fieldwork and Footnotes: Studies in the History of European Anthropology.'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; as: “the science of nations and peoples, or, that study of learned men in which they inquire into the origins, languages, customs, and institutions of various nations, and finally into the fatherland and ancient seats, in order to be able better to judge the nations and peoples in their own times.” &lt;ref&gt;Kollár, Adam František  − Historiae jurisque publici regni Ungariae amoenitates, I-II. Vienna., 1783&lt;/ref&gt;

Kollár's interest in linguistic and cultural diversity was aroused by the situation in his native multi-ethnic and multilingual [[History of Hungary|Kingdom of Hungary]] and his roots among its [[Slovak people|Slovaks]], and by the shifts that began to emerge after the gradual retreat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the more distant [[Balkans#Population composition by nationality and religion|Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghiţă Geană, "Discovering the whole of humankind: the genesis of anthropology through the Hegelian looking-glass." In: Han F. Vermeulen and Arturo Alvarez Roldán, eds. Fieldwork and Footnotes: Studies in the History of European Anthropology.'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the goals of ethnology have been the reconstruction of [[human history]], and the formulation of [[culture|cultural]] [[universal (metaphysics)|invariants]], such as the [[incest taboo]] and culture change, and the formulation of generalizations about "[[human nature]]", a concept which has been criticized since the 19th century by various philosophers ([[Hegel]], [[Marx]], [[structuralism]], etc.). In some parts of the world, ethnology has developed along independent paths of investigation and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] doctrine, with ''[[cultural anthropology]]'' becoming dominant especially in the [[United States]], and ''[[social anthropology]]'' in [[Great Britain]].  The distinction between the three terms is increasingly blurry. Ethnology has been considered an academic field since the late 18th century, especially in Europe and is sometimes conceived of as any comparative study of human groups.

[[File:Levi-strauss_260.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]]]
The 15th-century exploration of America by European explorers had an important role in formulating new notions of the Occident (the [[Western world]]), such as the notion of the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]".  This term was used in conjunction with "savages", which was either seen as a brutal barbarian, or alternatively, as the "[[noble savage]]". Thus, [[civilization]] was opposed in a dualist manner to [[barbary]], a classic opposition constitutive of the even more commonly shared [[ethnocentrism]]. The progress of ethnology, for example with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s [[structural anthropology]], led to the criticism of conceptions of a linear [[progress (history)|progress]], or the pseudo-opposition between "societies with histories" and "societies without histories", judged too dependent on a limited view of [[history]] as constituted by accumulative growth.

Lévi-Strauss often referred to [[Montaigne]]'s [[Essays (Montaigne)|essay]] on [[cannibalism]] as an early example of ethnology. Lévi-Strauss aimed, through a [[structuralism|structural method]], at discovering universal invariants in human society, chief among which he believed to be the [[incest taboo]]. However, the claims of such cultural [[Universality (philosophy)|universalism]] have been criticized by various 19th- and 20th-century social thinkers, including [[Marx]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Derrida]], [[Althusser]], and [[Deleuze]].

The French school of ethnology was particularly significant for the development of the discipline, since the early 1950s. Important figures in this movement have included Lévi-Strauss, [[Paul Rivet]], [[Marcel Griaule]], [[Germaine Dieterlen]], and [[Jean Rouch]].

The data is indexed by variety, character, country of origin, and contributor. There is a facility to select a variety and to find similar varieties based upon botanical characteristics. 

ECPD is the result of collaboration between participants in eight [[European Union]] countries and five East European countries. It is intended to be a source of information on varieties maintained by them. More than twenty-three scientific organisations are contributing to this information source.

The database is maintained and updated by the [[Scottish Agricultural Science Agency]] within the framework of the [[European Cooperative Programme for Crop Genetic Resources]] Networks (ECP/GR), which is organised by [[Bioversity International]].  The European Cultivated Potato Database was created to advance the conservation and use of genetic diversity for the well-being of present and future generations.

'''Five Wishes''' is a [[United States]] [[Advance health care directive|advance directive]] created by the non-profit organization [[Aging with Dignity]]. It has been described as the "living will with a heart and soul".&lt;ref&gt;Silva, Mark, "Living Will With Heart Now Available," The Miami Herald, 7/24/1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Five Wishes was originally introduced in 1996 as a Florida-only document,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwjf.org/reports/grr/029110s.htm "'Five Wishes:'" An Easy Advance Directive Promotes Dialogue on End-of-Life Care], Robert Wood Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; combining a [[living will]] and [[health care proxy|health care power of attorney]] in addition to addressing matters of comfort care and spirituality. With help from the [[American Bar Association]]'s Commission on Law and Aging and leading medical experts, a national version of Five Wishes was introduced in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Frank, "Living Will From Florida Goes Nationwide," The Miami Herald, 10/23/1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally distributed with support from a grant by the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]]. With assistance from the [[UnitedHealth Group|United Health Foundation]], Five Wishes is now available in 27 languages and in [[Braille]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://fivewishes.org/shop/order/product/five-wishes "Five Wishes" Languages]&lt;/ref&gt; More than 30 million documents have been distributed by a network of over 35,000 partner organizations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fivewishes.org/five-wishes/individuals-and-families "Five Wishes" Website].&lt;/ref&gt; An online version called Five Wishes Online was introduced in April 2011 allowing users to complete the document using an online interface or print out a blank version to complete by hand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fivewishes.org/shop/order/product/five-wishes-online "Five Wishes Online" page].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Five Wishes==

Wishes 1 and 2 are both legal documents. Once signed, they meet the legal requirements for an advance directive in the states listed [[Five Wishes#Meets Legal Requirements in 42 States|below]]. Wishes 3, 4, and 5 are unique to Five Wishes, in that they address matters of comfort care, spirituality, forgiveness, and final wishes.

===Wish 1: The Person I Want to Make Care Decisions for Me When I Can't=== 
This section is an assignment of a health care agent (also called proxy, surrogate, representative, or [[health care proxy|health care power of attorney]]). This person makes medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to speak for yourself.

===Wish 2: The Kind of Medical Treatment I Want or Don't Want===
This section is a living will—a definition of what life support treatment means to you, and when you would and would not want it.

===Wish 3: How Comfortable I Want to Be===
This section addresses matters of comfort care—what type of pain management you would like, personal grooming and bathing instructions, and whether you would like to know about options for [[hospice]] care, among others.

===Wish 4: How I Want People to Treat Me===
This section speaks to personal matters, such as whether you would like to be at home and whether you would like someone to pray at your bedside.

===Wish 5: What I Want My Loved Ones to Know===
This section deals with matters of forgiveness, how you wish to be remembered, and final wishes regarding [[funeral]] or memorial plans.

==Signing and witnessing requirements==
The last portion of the document contains a section for signing the document and having it witnessed. The document indicates which states require notarization.

==Legal requirements==
According to analysis by the American Bar Association's Commission on Law and Aging,&lt;ref&gt;Sabatino, Charles P. Esq., "National Advance Directives: One Attempt to Scale the Barriers", National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys Journal, Volume 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Five Wishes currently meets the legal requirements for an advance directive in the following 42 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agingwithdignity.org/five-wishes-states.php "Aging with Dignity" States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514000002/http://www.agingwithdignity.org/five-wishes-states.php |date=2009-05-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the remaining 8 states, (Alabama, Indiana, Kansas, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Utah) a statutory form is required, and one must attach the state document if one wishes to use the Five Wishes document as a guide.

{{italic title}}

'''''Fragrances of the World''''' is the largest independent [[Reference work|guide]] to [[Perfume|fragrance]] classification. First published in 1984 by [[Michael Edwards (fragrance expert)|Michael Edwards]] in [[Sydney]], Australia, the guide was originally named ''The Fragrance Manual'' before becoming ''Fragrances of the World'' in 2000. It has since been printed annually in a bilingual English-French edition. An online companion, the ''Fragrances of the World'' database, was launched in 2004 and, as of 2015, profiles over 17,000 perfumes, updated weekly.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.fragrancesoftheworld.info/ Fragrances of the World database - Fragrances of the World.Info&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fragrances of the World'' is considered a standard [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedic]] [[Reference work|reference]] within the fragrance industry, colloquially termed the “''Fragrance Bible''” (a registered [[trademark]] since 2011).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.sniffapaloozamagazine.com/MICHAEL-EDWARDS-INTERVIEW-SNIFFAPALOOZA-MAGAZINE.html Michael Edwards, Fragrances Of The World 2010 Edition, rare exclusive Interview with Michael Edwards, , Perfume Legends: French Feminine Fragrances, the cult book and collecto...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.basenotes.net/features/15-interview-with-michael-edwards-creator-of-fragrances-of-the-world Interview with Michael Edwards - creator of Fragrances of the World ~ by Grant Osborne — Basenotes.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Entries==

Some 8,000 perfumes were profiled in the 2015 printed edition of ''Fragrances of the World'', accompanied by brand name, date, fragrance family and gender. The online database, updated weekly, archives profiles of over 17,000 perfumes, listing brand name, corporate group, creative director, gender, perfumer, date, country of origin, bottle designer, fragrance family, an image, an olfactory pyramid and a pronunciation guide.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Michael. Fragrances of the World. Sydney, N.S.W.: Fragrances of the World, 2015. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Fragrances of the World'' database attempts to list all perfumes currently on the market, anywhere in the world. Each listing’s profile is written by the guide’s editorial team, who evaluate the perfume in collaboration with the fragrance’s perfumer and house evaluator.

If a mass-market perfume is discontinued, it remains listed in the guide for another two years, excluding fragrances deemed to be of outstanding influence, which are therefore maintained. Over 3,000 discontinued perfumes considered to be of exceptional popularity or historical importance have also been added to the listing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The guide is independently published by Fragrances of the World, funded by individual subscriptions. In the interest of neutrality, the guide contains no advertising and listings are made free of charge. However, the fragrances houses are not systematically consulted, and the content is often invented.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==History==

===Print edition=== 

In 1984, [[Michael Edwards (fragrance expert)|Michael Edwards]], having left [[Halston]] as international marketing director, was aware of the need for a guide to help retailers suggest perfumes to consumers. Though Edwards had previously tried to re-establish [[Firmenich]]’s defunct classification ''Bouquet de la Parfumerie'', the leading manual remained Haarmann &amp; Reimer’s ''Guide to Fragrance Ingredients'', an essentially technical genealogy unsuited to retail.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

That year in Sydney, Edwards independently published ''The Fragrance Manual'', the first retailer’s guide to fragrance classification, profiling three hundred perfumes. The manual proved a success, going through several editions, and was expanded at the request of [[Nordstrom]], first to include American fragrances, followed by men’s fragrances and niche brands.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The manual’s original linear, sectional layout, traditional to fragrance classifications, presented certain limitations. Consumer preferences, Edwards felt, did not necessarily fall into a particular [[Perfume#Olfactive families|olfactory group]] (floral, oriental, woody, etc), and could span two or more groups if linked by similar subgroups (i.e. soft florals being akin to floral orientals). This he addressed in the 1992 edition of ''The Fragrance Manual'', the first to feature an annular taxonomy known as the ‘[[fragrance wheel]]’, which organized olfactory groups in relation to one another while showing their interchange. The fragrance wheel proved a major innovation in perfume classification, its design copied widely throughout the fragrance industry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 2000, ''The Fragrance Manual'' was renamed ''Fragrances of the World''. The printed guide has since been published annually in a bilingual English-French edition.

===Online database===

The ''Fragrances of the World'' online database was launched in 2004, accessible by paid subscription. Due to its weekly updates and comprehensive scope (profiling over 17,000 perfumes in 2015), the database has largely superseded the guide’s printed edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whatmenshouldsmelllike.com/2014/10/26/an-evening-with-michael-edwards-founder-of-fragrances-of-the-world/ An Evening with Michael Edwards – founder of Fragrances of the World | What Men Should Smell Like&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Fragrance Finder, an application based on ''The Fragrance Manual'' designed to recommend perfumes according to consumer preferences, was originally developed for [[Sephora]] without success. The application was instead sold independently to retailers in 1994 on [[CD-ROM]], before appearing online in 2006.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Criticisms==
While ''Fragrances of the World'' has largely been adopted as a standard reference in the fragrance industry, the guide has also been subject to criticism. As an independent publication, the guide’s fragrance classifications are sometimes discordant with those of the perfume houses, and the creations are sometimes attributed to the wrong perfumer, causing debate. Its simplistic categories, largely devised for retail, differ from the complex subgroups featured in smaller technical manuals such as the ''Classification officielle des parfums et terminologie'' (also created in 1984), published by the French Society of Perfumers.{{how|date=June 2016}} Its content is also limited in comparison with free resources such as [[Basenotes]], Fragrantica or Perfume Intelligence, though it is considerably more accurate.

[[File:Restoration of T'ang dynasty Nestorian image of Jesus Christ.jpg|thumb|upright|Restoration of [[Tang dynasty]] [[Nestorian image of Jesus Christ]] which was found in the [[Mo-kao Caves#The Library Cave|Library Cave]]. The original work dated back to 9th century.]]
The '''Jesus Sutras''' are early [[Chinese language]] manuscripts blending [[Taoism|Taoist]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], and [[Christianity|Christian]] teachings. They are connected with the 7th-century mission of [[Alopen]], a [[Church of the East in China|Church of the East]] bishop from [[Sassanid Persia|Sassanian]] [[Mesopotamia]]. These manuscripts have been named ''[[sutra]]s'' (a word associated with Buddhist texts) only recently by Western authors.

The manuscripts date from between 635 AD, the year of Alopen's arrival in China, and around 1000 AD, when the cave at [[Mogao Caves|Mogao]] near [[Dunhuang]] in which the documents were discovered was sealed. By 2011 four of the manuscripts were known to be in a private collection in [[Japan]], while one was in [[Paris]]. Their language and content reflect varying levels of interaction with Chinese culture, including use of [[Buddhist]] and [[Taoist]] terminology.

==List of sutras==
The following list gives some approximate English titles for the various writings and an indication of the present location of the manuscript where known. Scholars are still debating the best translation for many of the terms.  Until a good modern edition appears, P. Y. Saeki remains the most convenient source for the Chinese texts.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

This manuscript and Kojima manuscript B are suspected of being modern forgeries; see below ref. to Lin &amp; Rong.

===The Xi'an Stele===
{{main|Nestorian Stele}}
The [[Xi'an]] [[Stela|Stele]] was erected in 781 to commemorate the propagation of the Da Qin Luminous Religion ("[[Daqin|Da Qin]]" is the Chinese term for the Roman Empire), and covers the preceding 150 years of Christianity in China.

[[Martin Palmer]] recently claimed, on the basis of research conducted by scholars in the 1930s, that the [[Daqin Pagoda]] near [[Lou Guan Tai]] was part of a Da Qin monastery. Lou Guan Tai was the traditional site of [[Lao Tze]]'s composition of the [[Tao Te Ching]]. Buried during a time of religious persecution in the 9th century, the stele was re-discovered in 1625 and is now on display in nearby Xi'an, the ancient capital of the Tang Dynasty.

==Sutra==
{{main|Sutra}}
[[Sutra]] (literally "binding thread", [[cognate]] with English "sew", "suture") is a [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] term referring to an [[aphorism]] or group of aphorisms. It was originally applied to [[Hindu philosophy]], and later to Buddhist [[Tripitaka|canon]] scripture. In the case of the Jesus Sutras, the term has been used indirectly by modern, Western authors. In [[Chinese written language|Chinese]], all religious and classical books are referred to as ''jing'' (經), including indigenous Chinese works, Buddhist scriptures, and other foreign works such as the [[Bible]] and the [[Koran]]. In the context of Buddhist scriptures, ''jing'' is conventionally translated as "sutra".  The Jesus Sutras do not carry canonical status but they do comingle Christian philosophy with Buddhist and [[Taoist]] thought.  A more neutral translation for ''jing'' (經) might simply be "book", although "scripture" may convey the entire nuanced meaning better.

[[File:Jewel House 2010.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Jewel House]]
The '''Jewel House''' is a vault housing the British [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] in the Waterloo Block (formerly a barracks) at the [[Tower of London]]. It was opened by Queen [[Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II]] in 1994 and refurbished in 2012. Regalia have been kept in various parts of the Tower since the 14th&amp;nbsp;century after a series of successful and attempted thefts at [[Westminster Abbey]].

==History==

===Pre-17th century===
A Keeper of the Crown Jewels was appointed in 1207. Over the subsequent centuries his title varied, from Keeper of the King's Jewels, Master of the Jewel House, Master and Treasurer of the King's Jewels and Plate, or Keeper of the Jewel House. He was also [[Treasurer of the Chamber]], a division of the [[Royal Household]] of the monarch. In this position he was also called Keeper of the Court Wardrobe, Keeper of the [[Privy Wardrobe]], or Receiver of the Chamber. In this capacity, he represented the [[Lord Treasurer]]'s interests in the regalia, and the wardrobe and privy wardrobe. Because of this, the Receiver of the Chamber exercised delegated authority over the Crown Jewels, especially those kept at the Tower of London (these two positions were separated in 1485).

Although a treasury had been located in the [[Tower of London]] from the earliest times (as in the sub-crypt of [[St John's Chapel, London|St&amp;nbsp;John's Chapel]] in the White Tower), from 1255 there was a separate Jewel House for state crowns and regalia, though not older crowns and regalia, in the grounds of [[Westminster Abbey]]. This Jewel House stood by the now-demolished Wardrobe Tower.
[[File:Chamber of the Pyx.jpg|thumb|The Chamber of the Pyx, Westminster Abbey]]
In 1378, the keeper gained control over at least a part of the royal jewels, and had a box in which he kept them, with two keys: one for himself and the other for the Lord Treasurer. This was the beginning of the Jewel House Department. The royal treasure was usually kept in the Tower of London, and at the Great Treasury, Westminster. Additionally, coronation regalia was, over the centuries, kept in the [[Chamber of the Pyx]] in Westminster Abbey. From the foundation of the abbey in {{circa|1050}} until 1303, the Chamber of the Pyx also held the general royal treasury. Most crowns were kept in the Tower of London from the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;III]], as were coronation regalia from 1643, except for some items which were in the abbey during the time of [[James II of England|James&amp;nbsp;II]].

Following Richard de Podnecott's attempted robbery of the [[Chamber of the Pyx]] in 1303, some regalia were moved to the Tower of London for safekeeping. A new Jewel House was built near the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] in 1378, and by the 1530s the reserve of jewels and plate was brought together in the rebuilt Jewel House, on the south side of the White Tower. Regalia were kept on the upper floor and plate on the lower floor. The coronation regalia would remain at Westminster Abbey until the 17th century.

===1660–1814===
[[File:A List of His Majesty's Regalia.jpg|thumb|A copy of the first Crown Jewels 'guidebook', {{circa|1690}}]]
The first keeper (however styled) after the [[English Restoration|restoration of the monarchy]] in 1660, Sir&amp;nbsp;[[Gilbert Talbot (courtier)|Gilbert Talbot]], was the last to exercise day-to-day control over the Jewel House. At that time, he was styled as Master and Treasurer of the Jewels and Plate. Spare plate was kept at the [[Palace of Whitehall]], and later, probably, at [[St&amp;nbsp;James's Palace]]. Very large quantities of spare plate were melted down and sold in 1680, and thereafter the Jewel House held comparatively little besides the items held at the Tower of London, though much of it was out on loan.

From 1660, as the Privy Wardrobe was no longer at the Tower of London, a caretaker was appointed as watchman for the Master of the Jewel House. He later became known as the Keeper of the Regalia or Keeper of the Jewel Office at the Tower. From this appointment, a separate branch of the Jewel House Department developed. When the latter was closed down, the Tower of London Jewel House alone remained. From 1665, the regalia were on show to the public, and over time this activity of the Jewel House became increasingly important.

In 1669, the regalia were moved to a new chamber in the Martin Tower. A custodian named Talbot Edwards showed the jewels to visitors for a small fee. At first, this was a very informal arrangement, with Edwards taking the regalia out of a locked cupboard to show it. The arrangement was ended in 1671, when Colonel [[Thomas Blood]] overpowered the custodian, tied him up and, with the help of three accomplices, made off with the Crown Jewels. All the items were recovered, though some had been damaged; [[St&amp;nbsp;Edward's Crown]] had been crushed with a mallet, and the [[Sovereign's Orb]] took a dent.

Drastic changes followed: an armed guard was provided, the collection was put behind bars in a windowless room, and the first guidebook to the Crown Jewels was published, formally establishing it as a visitor attraction. People were locked inside the tower during their visit and only permitted to see the jewels from a distance. For a small fee, they could reach through the bars and touch some of the jewels.&lt;ref name="MearsThurley1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth J. Mears|author2=Simon Thurley|author3=Claire Murphy|title=The Crown Jewels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r1GJnAEACAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Historic Royal Palaces Agency|asin=B000HHY1ZQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="England1869"&gt;{{cite book|editor=W. C. Hazlitt|title=Narrative of the Journey of an Irish Gentleman through England in 1752|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rw8HAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA111|year=1869|publisher=Chiswick press|pages=111–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1782, as part of a wider rationalisation of the Royal Household, the Department of the Jewel Office, under the [[Master of the Jewel Office]], who was generally a senior politician, was abolished, and the [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s Office took over the accounting functions, with an official called the Officer of the Jewels and Plate. From 1782 until 1814, there was only a resident caretaker to guard the regalia and other jewels at the Tower of London. In 1814, a Keeper of the Jewel House was appointed. He had a servant as "Exhibitor" (renamed Curator in 1921), responsible for the day-to-day custody of the jewels.

===1815–1966===
[[File:Jewel Room of 1868.gif|thumb|The Jewel Room of 1868]]
In 1815, a female visitor (later found insane) grabbed the State Crown and pulled it to bits,&lt;ref name="MearsThurley1994"/&gt; causing more than £10 worth of damage. This and the poor quality of the keeper's live-in accommodation led to an overhaul in 1816. A rail was installed to keep the public at a distance from the jewels, and the repaired State Crown and [[Crown Jewels of the United_Kingdom#Banqueting plate|Exeter Salt]] were put in glass cases on revolving tables. The whole collection was lit by six powerful [[argand lamp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Curtis|title=The London Encyclopaedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4zsKAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA193|volume=13|year=1829|publisher=J. Haddon|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By now, the Jewel House was a very lucrative business and, in the 1830s, the keeper earned £550 a year. When he lowered the entrance fee in 1838 in a bid to attract more visitors, his income soared to £1,500. Aghast, the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], which received no money from the enterprise but paid for the upkeep of the jewels, began to make new arrangements. In 1840, they drew up plans for the construction of a new building in the Tower of London to house the collection, opened in 1842.&lt;ref name="MearsThurley1994"/&gt;

The Crown Jewels were displayed in glass cases in the middle of a room with large windows so that people could walk around them and see them more clearly. In 1852, the keeper was formally recognised as a member of the Royal Household and paid a fixed salary. Unfortunately, the new Jewel House building was judged to be a fire hazard, and so a new chamber was constructed on the upper floor of the Wakefield Tower in 1868 by the architect Anthony Salvin. Apart from their temporary removal during war, and for ceremonial use, the Crown Jewels remained there until 1967.

===1967–1993===

}}
After the Second World War, the 19th&amp;nbsp;century Jewel House was inadequate both in terms of security and public access. At peak times, 1,500 visitors a day were coming to see the jewels. The 1967 Jewel House was built in the west wing of the Waterloo Barracks at a cost of £360,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVaMx4gQLC4|title=The Crown Jewels|year=1967|publisher=British Pathé}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was designed to cater for up to 5,000 visitors a day. An underground vault extending out under the lawns in front of the barracks housed the priceless coronation regalia, while the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom#Processional objects|State Trumpets]], maces and plate were displayed on the ground floor. Visitors walked down 49 steps to enter the concrete vault, said to be able to protect the Crown Jewels against a nuclear attack, and the regalia were in a large star-shaped case designed by the architect Alan Irvine, around which visitors proceeded clockwise under the supervision of wardens. A raised gallery 2&amp;nbsp;metres (7&amp;nbsp;ft) from the case allowed people to view the collection at a more leisurely pace.

An assistant curator had been appointed in 1963, and a second in 1968, when a new independent body of wardens and senior wardens was created to replace the former detail of [[Yeomen Warders]] of the Tower of London who had been responsible for the outward protection of the jewels. The post of Keeper of the Jewel House was combined with that of the Resident Governor of the Tower of London in 1968, and a Deputy Governor assumed much of his responsibilities. In 1990, the Jewel House and the Tower of London became the responsibility of the new [[Historic Royal Palaces]] agency.

===1994–2011===
[[File:Imperial State Crown - Seitenansicht von unten.jpg|thumb|The [[Imperial State Crown]]]]
By the 1980s, up to 15,000 people a day were visiting the jewels, causing queues up to an hour long. The display had also begun to look old-fashioned; according to David Beeton, then CEO of Historic Royal Palaces, "they were displayed as if they were in a jeweller's shop window".&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/tourism-polishing-the-crown-jewels-tower-of-london-is-aiming-to-use-disney-techniques-without-being-1430498.html|title=Polishing the Crown Jewels: Tower of London is aiming to use Disney techniques without being too Mickey Mouse|date=20 March 1994|author=David Bowen|newspaper=Independent on Sunday|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, it was decided to bring the coronation regalia out of the underground vault and build a new Jewel House with larger capacity on the ground floor of the building at a cost of £10&amp;nbsp;million. Inspiration for the layout and presentation was taken from [[Disneyland Paris|Disneyland]], the [[Seville Expo '92|Seville Expo]] and jewel houses across Europe.&lt;ref name="indy"/&gt;

The new Jewel House was opened by Queen [[Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II]] on 24&amp;nbsp;March&amp;nbsp;1994. It occupies almost the entire ground floor of the Waterloo Block (formerly a barracks) and is designed to allow up to 20,000 people a day to see the collection of more than 100 priceless objects and 23,578 diamonds, rubies, emeralds and sapphires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |date=29 March 2012|title=See the new revamped Crown Jewels exhibit at the Tower of London|medium=YouTube Video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsuSGrZAhmM|access-date=5 January 2015|publisher=Daily Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were lit by state-of-the-art [[fibre optics]] and rested on French velvet.

However, critics derided the experience as "just an exercise in crowd management, beautifully lit and presented but literally mechanistic",&lt;ref name="LeaskYeoman1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anna Leask|author2=Ian Yeoman|title=Heritage Visitor Attractions: An Operations Management Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CgX51i_6zMcC&amp;pg=PA77|year=1999|publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA|isbn=0-8264-6061-5|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the six-inch-thick, two-tonne steel doors,&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; and the use of a [[travelator]] at peak times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/travel/travel-advisory-a-new-home-for-england-s-crown-jewels.html|title=A New Home for England's Crown Jewels|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present day===
In 2012, the exhibit was given a £2.5&amp;nbsp;million revamp to include a new introduction area with a video showing the history of the Crown Jewels and explaining how they are used in the [[Coronation of the British Monarch|coronation ceremony]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/28/crown-jewels-new-exhibition|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 March 2012|accessdate=15 December 2015|title=Crown Jewels go on show for major new exhibition}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jewels themselves are displayed in the order they are used in the ceremony, and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s [[coronation anthem]]s can be heard as visitors tour the exhibition. Brighter lights were installed to present the jewels in a more natural way, and a new lift provides disabled access to the viewing platform. The Jewel House was officially reopened by the [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]] on 29&amp;nbsp;March&amp;nbsp;2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/news-and-media/press-resources/tower-of-london-press-releases-and-archives/tower-of-london-press-release-archive/hrh-princess-royal-opens-crown-jewels/|title=HRH Princess Royal opens Crown Jewels|publisher=Historic Royal Palaces|accessdate=17 December 2015|date=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The underground vault built in 1967 is home to 25,000 architectural drawings of historic royal palaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.hrp.org.uk/curators/historic-royal-patchworks/|title=Historic Royal… Patchworks?|publisher=Historic Royal Palaces|accessdate=8 February 2016|date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==

The 38 [[Yeomen Warders]], ex-military personnel employed by [[Historic Royal Palaces]], also provide security, though their daytime role is more concerned with managing the large number of visitors. Unlike the soldiers of the Tower Guard, who rotate, the Yeomen Warders are permanent and live in the tower itself. The present body dates from 1485, and they wear similar uniforms to the Sovereign's bodyguards, the [[Yeomen of the Guard]], of which they have been extraordinary members since 1550.

The jewels are removed on the authority of the [[Lord Chamberlain]], head of the Royal Household, exercised by his deputy the Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain's Office. He signs a voucher on receipt of the items from the Deputy Governor. Only the [[Crown Jeweller]] can handle the regalia. It is customary for armed police officers to be present at all times. In 2011, Colonel Richard Harrold was appointed as the [[Resident Governor of the Tower of London and Keeper of the Jewel House|Keeper of the Jewel House]]. The Chief Exhibitor of the Jewel House is Keith Hanson, and the Deputy Chief Exhibitor is Lyn Jones.

[[File:Collar.agr.jpg|thumb|[[Shirt]] with labels]]
[[File:Bananas on countertop.JPG|thumb|A bunch of [[banana]]s with a label]]
[[File:Wikilabel.jpg|thumb|A label with faux [[Embossing (paper)|embossing]]]]
A '''label''' (as distinct from [[signage]]) is a piece of [[paper]], [[plastic film]], [[cloth]], [[metal]], or other material affixed to a [[Packaging and labelling|container]] or [[Product (business)|product]], on which is written or [[printing|print]]ed information or symbols about the product or item. Information printed directly on a container or article can also be considered [[Packaging and labelling|labeling]].

Labels have many uses, including providing information on a product's origin, manufacturer (e.g., [[brand name]]), use, shelf-life and disposal, some or all of which may be governed by legislation such as that for food in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=UK Food Labelling &amp; Packaging|url=https://www.gov.uk/food-labelling-and-packaging/overview|accessdate=5 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Food Label Requirements in a Nutshell|url=http://www.foodpackaginglabels.net/food-labeling-requirements/|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of production and attachment to packaging are many and various and may also be subject to [[List of technical standard organisations|internationally recognised standards]]. In many countries, hazardous products such as [[poison]]s or [[flammable]] liquids must have a warning label.

==Uses==
[[File:Fire extinguisher.jpg|thumb|180px|Fire extinguisher with permanent and temporary labels]]
Labels may be used for any combination of identification, information, [[Warning label|warning]], instructions for use, environmental advice or advertising. They may be stickers, permanent or temporary labels or printed packaging.

===Products===
Permanent [[product (business)|product]] identification by a label is commonplace; labels need to remain secure throughout the life of the product. For example, a [[VIN]] plate on an automobile must be resistant to heat, oils and tampering; similarly, a [[Food labeling|food label]] must endure until the food has been used. Removable product labels need to bond until they are removed. For example, a label on a new refrigerator has installation, usage and environmental information: the label needs to be able to be removed cleanly and easily from the unit once installed.

Labels for food and beverages typically include critical information pertinent to the contents or ingredients used in a product, and may also call out to certain allergy risks such as the presence of gluten or soy. The FDA also provides standards to regulate the information provided on the labels and packaging of wine and spirits. These labels include information like brand name, class and type designation, and alcohol content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ttb.gov/consumer/labeling_advertising.shtml|title=Alcoholic Beverage Labeling and Advertising|last=|first=|date=2017-03-24|website=Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Packaging===
[[Packaging]] may have labeling attached to or integral with the package. These may carry pricing, barcodes, [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] identification, usage guidance, addresses, advertising, recipes, and so on. They also may be used to help resist or indicate tampering or pilferage.

===Assets===
In industrial or military environments, asset labeling is used to clearly identify assets for maintenance and operational purposes. Such labels are frequently made of engraved [[Traffolyte]] or a similar material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Paula|first=K|last2=Ashraf|first2=A|title=Asset Labels, Asset Sticker, Property ID, Property Labels: Asset Label Generator|newspaper=Asset Labels Australia|date=January 4, 2013|url=http://www.assetlabels.com.au//}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually tamper-evident, permanent or [[Frangibility|frangible]] and usually contain a barcode for electronic identification using readers. For example, the US Military uses a [[Item Unique Identification|UID]] system for its assets.

===Textiles===
{{see also|Laundry symbol}}
Garments normally carry separate care/treatment labels which, in some regions, are subject to legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/bus50-clothes-captioning-complying-care-labeling-rule "Clothes Captioning: Complying with the Care Labeling Rule"]. (November 2001). Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission (United States)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Textile Industry Affairs: Writing a care label|url=http://www.textilecare.com/writing.htm|accessdate=5 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These labels typically indicate how the item should be washed (e.g., machine washed vs. [[dry cleaning]]), whether bleach can be used. Textile labels may be woven into the garment or attached, and may be heat resistant (so survivable in hot-air dryers and when pressed), colorfast (so does not bleed onto the garment), washable, [[leather]] or PVC/Plastic. Printed labels are an alternative to woven labels. Some upholstered furniture and mattresses have labels that are required by law, describing the contents of the stuffing.

Textiles containing pesticides as an ingredient may also require government approval and compulsory labeling. In the USA, for example, labels have to state the pesticide registration number, statement of ingredients, storage and disposal information, and the following statement: "It is a violation of Federal Law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling”. A label including a company name or identification number and a material content list may also be required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus21-threading-your-way-through-labeling-requirements-under-textile-and-wool-acts "Threading Your Way Through the Labeling Requirements Under the Textile and Wool Acts"]. (May 2005). Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission (United States)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mailing===
Mailing labels identify the addressee, the sender and any other information which may be useful in transit. Many software packages such as [[word processor]] and [[contact manager]] programs produce standardized mailing labels from a [[data set]] that comply with postal standards. These labels may also include routing barcodes and special handling requirements to expedite delivery.

===Specialized labels {{Anchor|digital hang tag}}===
* '''Notebook labels''' are mainly used for identifying the owner and purpose of the notebook. Some information on a label may include name, contents, and date started.
*'''Piggyback''' labels are made from combining two layers of adhesive substrate. The bottom layer forms the backing for the top. The label can be applied to any object as normal, the top layer can be a removable label that can be applied elsewhere, which may change the message or marking on the remaining label underneath. Often used on Express mail envelopes. Other applications include price change labels where when being scanned at the till, the till assistant can peel back the price-reduction label and scan the original barcode enabling stock flow management. These labels are also seen on magazine subscription renewals, allowing customers to re-subscribe to the magazine with an easy peel and stick label sent back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.printindustry.com/Newsletters/Newsletter-172.aspx|title=What is Kiss Cutting, What are Piggyback Labels?|website=www.printindustry.com|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as the retained label is adhesive free it prevents customers from re-applying the cheaper priced labels to premium products.
* '''[[Smart label]]s''' have [[RFID]] chips embedded under the label stock.
*'''Blockout''' labels are not see-through at all, concealing what lies underneath with a strong gray adhesive.
*'''Radioactive''' labels. The use of [[radioactivity|radioactive]] [[isotopes]] of chemical elements, such as [[carbon-14]], to allow the [[in vivo]] tracking of [[chemical compounds]].
*'''Laser''' or '''printer''' labels are generally die cut on 8.5" x 11" (US letter) or A4 sized sheets, and come in many different shapes, sizes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iidsolutions.co.uk/templates/uploads/documents/products/2152780_1.pdf |title=Examples of printer label formats|publisher=Iidsolutions.co.uk|accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; formats and materials. Laser label material is a nonporous stock made to withstand the intense heat of laser printers and copiers. A drawback of laser labels is that the entire sheet needs to be printed before any labels are used; once labels have been removed the sheet cannot be put through the printer again without damaging the printing mechanism. Inkjet label material is a porous stock made to accept ink and dye from an inkjet printer.  One of the more modern inkjet label material stocks is waterproof printable inkjet material commonly used for soap or shower gel containers.
*[[Security label]]s are used for anti-[[counterfeit]]ing, brand protection, [[tamper-evident]] seals and [[package pilferage|anti-pilferage seals]]. These combine a number of overt and covert features to make reproduction difficult. The use of [[security printing]], [[holography]], [[Embossing (paper)|embossing]], [[barcode]]s, [[RFID]] chips, custom printing and weak (or weakened) backings is common. They are used for [[authentication]], theft reduction, and protection against counterfeit and are commonly used on ID cards, credit cards, packaging, and products from CDs to electronics to clothing.
*'''Antimicrobial''' labels. With the growth in hospital acquired infections such as [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and E-Coli the use of antimicrobial labels in infection sensitive areas of hospitals are helping in combating these types of microbes.
*'''Fold-out''' labels, also known as ''booklet'', ''multi-page'' or ''extended'' labels, or ''lablets'' (combined label + leaflet). Where the pack is not large enough for a single label to carry all the required information, fold-out labels are often preferred to separate leaflets, which can easily be lost. These labels are frequently seen on agricultural chemicals and consumer pharmaceuticals.
*'''Barcode labels''' A large proportion of labels produced today carry [[barcode]]s, either for product identification, for traceability in items such as freight packages, and on items requiring brand authentication and protection. There are many different formats of barcodes found on labels, but one of the most commonly distributed formats is the [[International Article Number (EAN)]]. This is the code used to identify retail products worldwide, and is found on almost all consumer level packaging labels.

==Stock types==
Label "stock" is the carrier which is commonly [[coated]] on one side with adhesive and printed on the other, and can be:
*'''Paper''' - a variety of papers and [[paperboard]]s can be used as labels
*'''[[Nonwoven fabric]]''' - for extra durability
*'''Latex''' – a lithographic stock with some added [[latex]] allows the label to be much more flexible and form around certain curved objects more easily than standard paper;
[[File:ASUS IIIIIII.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Labels on a laptop.]]
*'''[[Plastic]]s''' such as [[Cellulose acetate|acetate]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], and [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] allow a variety of features, such as greater [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[stiffness]], [[transparency (optics)|transparency]] and resistance to tearing. They typically require special equipment and printing methods ([[ultra-violet]] curing is common) as they do not normally print well with conventional ink.  A [[bumper sticker]] is usually a vinyl label with a very strong, durable adhesive and lightfast inks.  [[Embossing tape]] is "printed" by pressing raised elements similar to [[Sort (typesetting)|printing type]] onto it, which produces raised glyphs that look white due to discoloration of the plastic. A type known as 'destructible vinyl' is commonly used for asset labels. It combines a very thin frangible face stock with a very strong high tack adhesive, thus making the label impossible to remove without damaging it. Engraved multi-layer [[Traffolyte]] labels are frequently used in industrial situations due to their durability;
*'''Foil''' – [[Aluminum foil]] and vapor-coated [[plastic film]]s are often chosen for the bright reflective characteristics;
*'''Thermal''' – direct thermal label stock will change [[color]] (usually black) when heated. A heating element in the shape of letters or images can be used to create an image on the label. Custom labels can be easily be made on location in this way. A disadvantage is durability, because another heat source can ruin or obscure the image, or it may fade completely over time;
*'''Thermal transfer''' for applications that cannot use thermal (thermal direct) label material because of heat source proximity or short label life, a more widely used material is the thermal transfer [[label printer]]. This material has the advantage of a much longer readable life and does not fade with time or heat. Most major manufacturers of thermal printers can be used for either thermal transfer (TT) or thermal (DT) labels. A thermal transfer ribbon will be required to print the labels. The cost of the ribbons + TT labels is similar to that of the DT labels on their own;
*'''Thermal transfer ribbon types''':
** Wax is the most popular as it has some smudge resistance, and is suitable for matte and semi-gloss paper labels;
** Wax and resin are smudge resistant, suitable for semi-gloss paper and some synthetic labels;
** Resin is scratch and chemical resistant, suitable for coated synthetic labels;
*'''None''' – labels can be printed directly on adhesive without using a [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]]. Labels made in this manner are extremely fragile, however, and have been rendered virtually obsolete by other printing methods such as [[screen-printing|silk screen]];

The stock type will affect the types of ink that will print well on them. Corona treating or flame treating some plastics makes them more receptive to inks, coatings, and other substrates by reducing surface tension and improving overall adhesion of the plastics.

An alternative method of labelling is weaving the text directly into fabric.

==Attachment==
[[File:Plastic bottle of milk.jpg|thumb|180px|Shrink label over PET bottle of milk]]
Labels can be attached by:
* Heat activated adhesives: for example, "in-mold labeling" can be part of [[blow molding]] containers and employs heat activated adhesives. [[Hot melt adhesive]]s are also used.
* [[Pressure-sensitive adhesive]]s (also called PSA or self-stick) are applied with light pressure without activation or heat. PSA labels often have [[release liner]]s which protect the adhesive and assist label handling.
* [[Rivet]]s used to attach information plates to industrial equipment.
* [[Shrink wrap]] for printed shrinkable labels placed over packages and then heated to shrink them.
* [[Sewing]] for fabrics such as clothing, tents, mattresses and industrial sacks.
* Wet glue such as [[starch]], [[dextrin]], [[Polyvinyl acetate|PVA]] or water moistenable gummed adhesive.
* [[Yarn]], [[twine]] or plastic tie, usually referred to as a [[swing tag]].
* Static cling, where "stickers" have a static charge enabling them to attach without adhesive to smooth surfaces such as glass.

===Pressure-sensitive adhesive types===
Pressure-sensitive label adhesives are commonly made from water-based [[Acrylate polymer|acrylic]] adhesives, with a smaller volume made using solvent-based adhesives and hotmelt adhesives. The most common adhesive types are:
*'''Permanent''' – Typically not designed to be removed without tearing the stock, damaging the surface, or using solvents. The adhesion strength and speed can also be varied. For example, full adhesion can be nearly instant, or the label can be almost removable for a short period with full adhesion developing in minutes or hours (known as respositionable adhesives).
*'''Peelable''' – Adhesion is fairly strong and will not fall off in normal circumstances, but the label can be removed relatively easily without tearing the base stock or leaving adhesive behind on the old surface. The adhesive is usually strong enough to be applied again elsewhere. This type is frequently known as 'removable'. There are many different types of removable adhesives, some are almost permanent, some are almost 'ultra peelable'.
*'''Ultra-peelable''' – Designed principally for use on book covers and glass, when removed these adhesives labels do not leave any residue whatsoever. Adhesion is weak and only suitable for light duty applications. Normally these labels have very little adhesion to anything once they've been removed.
*'''Freezer or frost fix''' – Most permanent and peelable adhesives have a service temperature limit of -10 degrees Celsius, whereas freezer (otherwise known as frost fix) adhesives have a service temperature -40 degrees Celsius and are suitable for deep freeze use.
*'''High tack''' – A type of permanent adhesive that exhibits a high initial grab to the application surfaces, and is commonly used at higher coat weights to enable labels to adhere strongly to difficult, rough or dirty surfaces.

===Application===
[[File:label dispenser.jpg|thumb| A typical [[label dispenser]]]]
Labels may be supplied separately or on a roll or sheet. Many labels are pre-printed by the manufacturer. Others have printing applied manually or automatically at the time of application. Specialized high speed [[label printer applicator]]s may be used to apply labels to packages; these and other methods may be subject to recognized standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ASTM D5375 Standard Test Methods for Liner removal at High Speeds from Pressure-Sensitive Label Stock}} [[ASTM]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ASTM D6252 Standard Test Method for Peel Adhesion of Pressure Sensitive Label Stocks at 90 deg Angle}} [[ASTM]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some labels have protective overcoats, laminates, or tape to cover them after the final print is applied. This is sometimes before application and sometimes after. Labels are often difficult to peel and apply.  A [[label dispenser]] can speed up this task.

==Usability==
Aspects such as legibility, literacy and interpretation come into play for users of labels, and label writers therefore need some degree of [[professional writing]] skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gold|first=Karen|publisher=New Scientist|date=13 June 1992|title=If all else fails, read the instructions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending upon country or region, international standards may be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ASTM D7298-06 Standard Test Method for Measurement of Comparative Legibility by Means of Polarizing Filter Instrumentation}} [[ASTM]]&lt;/ref&gt; Where literacy may be an issue, [[pictograms]] may feature alongside text, such as those advanced by [[CropLife International]] in their ''Responsible Use'' manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Responsible and Effective Use of Crop Protection Products|url=https://d1jkwdgw723xjf.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Guidelines-for-the-safe-and-effective-use-of-crop-protection-products.pdf.|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labels or printed packaging may include [[Braille]] to aid users with [[Blindness|visual impairment]].

Criticism of label readability is not uncommon; for example, Canadian researchers found that medicine labels did not consistently follow legibility guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Small font, all capitals makes prescription labels too hard to read|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2014/07/09/small-font-all-capitals-makes-prescription-labels-too-hard-to-read-study|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries and industries, for example the UK (food)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Standards Agency - Clear food labelling - Guidance|url=http://multimedia.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/clearfoodlabelling.pdf|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and EU (medicines)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurpopean Commission: Guideline of the readability of the labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-2/c/2009_01_12_readability_guideline_final_en.pdf|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; label guidelines are not legally binding (the latter using phrases such as ''"The type size should be as large as possible to aid readers..."'') and thus are unenforceable. On the other hand, countries may stipulate legal minima for readability, such as the USA's FDA on nutritional information&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA - Labeling and Nutrition|url=http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/labelingnutrition/ucm064904.htm|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia/New Zealand's code for food labels and packs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Standards Australia New Zealand|url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/code/userguide/Documents/Guide%20to%201.2.9%20-%20Legibility%20Requirements.pdf|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental considerations==

Labels may affect the environment during manufacture, use, and post-use.  Choice of backings, coatings, adhesives, and liners can be strong factors.  Environmental regulations and guidelines can come from many sources.  Users of labels on [[packaging]] may consider some of the [[sustainable packaging]] guidelines. Based on the solid [[waste hierarchy]], the quantity and size of labels should be minimized without reducing necessary functionality. Material content of a label should comply with applicable regulations. [[Life cycle assessment]]s of the item being labeled and of the label itself are useful to identify and improve possible environmental effects. For example, reuse or recycling are sometimes aided by a label being removable from a surface.

If a label remains on an item during recycling, a label should be chosen which does not hinder the recyclability of the item.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kovach|first=A|last2=Brown|first2=S|title=Label recycling: a materials issue|newspaper=Packaging Digest|date=July 1, 2008|url=http://www.packagingdigest.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Katz|first=S|title=Waste Recycling|newspaper=Label and Narrow Web|date=July 2008|url=http://www.labelandnarrowweb.com/articles/2008/07/waste-recycling}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, when labeled corrugated boxes are recycled, wet strength paper labels do not hinder box recycling: the PSA adhesive stays with the backing and is easily removed. Paper backings without wet strength may release their adhesives, potentially contaminating recycling efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pstc.org/technical_notes/to_recycle.php?subject=packaging|title= Packaging Tapes:To Recycle of Not|accessdate=2007-11-06 |last= Jensen|first= Timothy|date=April 1999|publisher=Adhesives and Sealants Council |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071109204909/http://www.pstc.org/technical_notes/to_recycle.php?subject=packaging &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

An [[eco-label]] is used on consumer products (including foods) to identify products that may be less damaging to the environment and/or humans than other related products, such as sustainable seafood encouraged by [[Friend of the Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Seafood Products Certification|url=http://www.friendofthesea.org/|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other aspects==

===Color===
Ink and base stock color choices commonly conform to the [[Pantone]] Matching System (PMS) colors. The Pantone system is very dominant in the label printing industry. Additionally specialty inks such as metallic, UV ink, magnetic ink, and more are available. Ink is usually transparent however it can be made opaque. It has been known for certain companies to patent "their own" color. Digital labels use process colors to replicate Pantone solid colors.

===Collectability===
Collecting labels is a worldwide phenomenon, from labels used on [[Phillumeny|matchboxes]] and foodstuffs (e.g., [[cheese]]), [[wine]], to printed packages. Collectors are attracted to labels both for their influence on artistic design and the history of retailing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Opie|first=Robert|title=The Art of the Label|page=140|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|date=1987|ISBN=0671654411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="217197">The following tables compare traits given to [[vampires]] in folklore and fiction. Over time, some attributes now regarded as integral became incorporated into the vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared over the course of the 19th century, with [[Varney the Vampire]] and [[Count Dracula]] both bearing protruding teeth,&lt;ref name="Skal99"&gt;Skal, ''V for Vampire'', p.&amp;nbsp;99.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau|Murnau's]] ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922) the first vampire to be killed by daylight.&lt;ref name="Skal104"&gt;Skal, ''V for Vampire'', p.&amp;nbsp;104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel is the best known vampire fiction of the 19th century, it is the aristocratic figure of [[Lord Ruthven (vampire)|Lord Ruthven]] who is thought to have inspired the elegant and suave creature of stage and film.&lt;ref name="Skal75"&gt;Skal, ''V for Vampire'', p.&amp;nbsp;175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright [[Hamilton Deane]] to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage.&lt;ref name="Skal62"&gt;Skal, ''V for Vampire'', p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore.&lt;ref name="SU389"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, ''The Vampire Film'', pp.&amp;nbsp;38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martin van Marum by Charles Howard Hodges.JPG|thumb|right|Martin van Marum by [[Charles Howard Hodges]].]]
'''Martin(us) van Marum''' (20 March 1750, [[Delft]] – 26 December 1837, [[Haarlem]]) was a Dutch physician, inventor, scientist and teacher, who studied medicine and philosophy in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. Van Marum introduced modern chemistry in the Netherlands after the theories of [[Lavoisier]], and several scientific applications for general use. He became famous for his demonstrations with instruments, most notable the ''[[Large electrostatic generator (Teylers)|Large electricity machine]]'', to show statical electricity and chemical experiments while curator for the [[Teylers Museum]].

==Biography==
=== Early career ===
Born in Delft, Van Marum moved to [[Haarlem]] in 1776 ''because the Haarlemmers had more taste in the sciences than anywhere else in the Netherlands.''&lt;ref name="Deugd boven geweld"&gt;{{cite book |title=Deugd boven geweld – Een geschiedenis van Haarlem 1245–1995
|publisher=Historisch Werkgroep Haarlem en Gemeentearchief, 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his arrival in Haarlem he began to practise medicine, but devoted himself mainly to lecturing on physical subjects and creating instruments to demonstrate physical theory. He must have made a big impression on Haarlem society, because he became a member of the [[Dutch Society of Science]] in the same year, but was named director and curator of their cabinet of curiosities in the next year.&lt;ref name="maatschappij"&gt;[[Johannes Abraham Bierens de Haan]], De geschiedenis van een verdwenen Haarlemsch museum van natuurlijke historie. Het Kabinet van Naturalien van de Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen 1759–1866. Haarlem, F. Bohn, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Van Marum received at first no salary, but by scaring off the former cabinet concierge Nicolaus Linder, he was able to collect Linder's' salary of 100 guilders, and when the cabinet moved later in 1777 to new quarters in the [[Grote Houtstraat]] 51, van Marum lived there as concierge.&lt;ref name="maatschappij" /&gt; He managed to scare off Linder by obtaining permission from the society to allow his servants to keep tips they received from cabinet visitors; a source of income that Linder had come to rely on. Then van Marum increased this salary to 300 from 100 by adding responsibilities to his list of duties, such as a summer garden in the Rozenprieel and eliminating other expenses.&lt;ref name="maatschappij" /&gt;

===Curator of two museums===

[[File:Electrostatic generator Teylers Museum.jpg|thumb|Martinus van Marum's electrostatic generator at [[Teylers Museum]]]]
In 1779 he was entrusted with the care of the ''Second society'' left to Haarlem by [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]] (1702–1778), which led under his direction to the foundation of the [[Teylers Museum]]. The Teyler legacy was split into three societies, one for religion, one for science, and one for the arts, known as the first, second, and third societies. The caretakers had to meet in Teyler's home weekly, and each society had 5 caretakers, so all of the gentlemen involved lived in Haarlem. 

In 1794 van Marum became secretary as well as director of the Dutch Society of Science. Under his management, both societies were advanced to the position of the most noted in Europe. Period travelogues mention both Museums.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HgMZAAAAYAAJ p 188 van Marum's museum] in ''Journal of a horticultural tour through some parts of Flanders, Holland, and the North of France, in the autumn of 1817'' by [[Patrick Neill (naturalist)|Patrick Neill]], on the [[Google Books Library Project]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being involved with the ''Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen'', he was an ordinary member (5 December 1776) and a corresponding member (from 25 December 1776) of the [[Provinciaal Utrechtsch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen]], a member of the [[Bataafsch Genootschap der Proefondervindelijke wijsbegeerte]] from 1784, a member of the [[Zeeuwsch Genootschap der Wetenschappen]] from 27 August 1782, corresponding member of the [[Académie des Sciences]] from 1783, and a member of the ''Vergadering van Notabelen voor het departement Zuiderzee'' from 29 March 1814. In 1808 he was asked by [[Louis Bonaparte]] to be a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|committee for the formation of the Koninklijk Instituut]] along with [[Jeronimo de Bosch]], [[Jean Henri van Swinden]], and [[Martinus Stuart]]. He became member of the institute the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00001775 |title=Martinus van Marum (1750–1837) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merging societies, separate collections===
Under his guidance the two societies slowly merged. His name is associated with the ''Electriseermachine'', the largest electricity demonstration machine with [[Leiden jar]]s built in the 18th century and at the time a crowd pleaser for the young Teylers museum. The demonstration model is still on display, as is a smaller version in the [[Museum Boerhaave]] of [[Leiden]]. Van Marum's researches (especially in connection with electricity) were remarkable for their number and variety. 

The Teyler's Museum kept its role as a museum of scientific research (some of the periodical subscriptions he started are still running) and is a repository of important scientific demonstration models from the period. Not only items regarding electricity, but also weather stations, industrial models, steam engines, and other examples of the budding industrial revolution were collected and lovingly displayed. The collection of the Teyler's was mostly based on scientific theory, while the collection of the Dutch Society of Science was mostly based on scientific practise. The rooms in the Grote Houtstraat were filled with stuffed animals and other "naturalia", while the summer garden was a modern continuation of Linder's old [[Linnaeus]] hortus once located behind the original city hall quarters in the Prinsenhof. Since Linder had not known any Latin, it was easier for Van Marum to entertain foreign visitors with stories of Linnaean trivia and of course, the Haarlem story of [[tulip mania]].

===Teylers Museum===
In 1784, when the Teylers Museum opened its new 'Oval Room', the artist [[Vincent Jansz van der Vinne]] was hired as curator of the art collection and lived in Pieter Teyler's former residence that was called the "[[Fundatiehuis (Teyler)|Fundatiehuis]]" as concierge and caretaker of the art collection.&lt;ref name=Kastelein&gt;Van kastelein tot directeur. Teylers museum in de 20ste eeuw. Stichting Vrienden van Teylers Museum (1975–2000), {{ISBN|90-71835-13-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the next year because of continuous disagreements with van Marum over art and the opening hours of the museum.&lt;ref name=Kastelein /&gt; 

Van der Vinne was an artist born into an important Haarlem artist family – he was the great-grandson of [[Vincent van der Vinne]]. The Teyler's museum replaced him with another local artist, [[Wybrand Hendricks]], who painted the famous oval room and many other Haarlem scenes. Hendricks is largely responsible for the Teyler's collection of [[Old Master]] prints, most notably the purchase in Rome 1790 of a print &amp; drawing collection formerly owned by [[Christina of Sweden]].&lt;ref name=Kastelein /&gt; Apparently he got along under van Marum, but when he left in 1819 at the age of 75, the Teyler's decided to discontinue the purchase of art "for the decline in art enthusiasts in this city".&lt;ref name=Kastelein /&gt;

During the tenure of Hendriks, van Marum himself was busy giving public demonstrations of electricity in the Oval room, but was also collecting in this period (this is why he was so involved with the lifestyle of the concierge of the Fundatiehuis, since he was there every day).&lt;ref name=Kastelein /&gt; He concentrated on scientific publications for the Teyler library. He concentrated his efforts on three aspects: 1) Greek and Latin authors, among them the church fathers, 2) Works of natural history including [[Travel literature|travelogue]]s, and 3) natural history periodicals, including all publications of the [[Royal Society of London]] and all publications of the Dutch Society of Science, which Teyler had been a member of, but could not be on the board of, due to religious differences with the board. The criteria for purchase was always expense. If a Society member could afford to purchase it himself it was not worth adding to the collection. Any member could suggest purchases, however, which explains why the collection is filled with richly illustrated examples of contemporary publications. The most impressive of these are the large illustrated books of travellers. To view the collection, van Marum organised ''gentleman evenings'' in Pieter Teyler's library, a tradition that still exists.

==Legacy==
[[File:Van Marum Martinus 1826.jpg|thumb|right|Martin van Marum in 1826. This portrait was commissioned by the Teylers Museum, but van Marum hated it. He had another portrait painted by Hodges that he preferred.]]
Though the public is allowed access during the day to the museum rooms, the private rooms of Pieter Teyler in the "Fundatiehuis" are only open one day a year, on Monument Day. Because of its rich scientific tradition, many noted scholars of Physics moved to Haarlem to work at Teyler's, including [[Nobel prize]] winners [[Pieter Zeeman]] and [[Hendrik Lorentz]].

Of van Marum's three categories, only the first was discontinued at the close of the 19th century. The collection of periodicals which has been expanded through exchange networks, contains uninterrupted series that are among the oldest in the world.

The Teyler's museum created a new wing in 1996 to house a rotational display of van Marum's library collection, such as the works of [[John James Audubon]] in combination with contemporary stuffed birds of [[Naturalis]].

{{merge from|Foreign worker|date=March 2018}}
A "'''migrant worker'''" is a person who either [[Human migration|migrates]] within their home country or outside it to pursue work such as [[Temporary work|seasonal work]]. Migrant workers usually do not have an intention to stay permanently in the country or region in which they work.

Migrant workers who work outside their home country may also be called [[foreign worker]]s or [[expatriate]]s, especially when they are sent for or invited to work in the host country before leaving the home country.

The [[International Labour Organization]] estimated in 2014 there were 232 million international migrants worldwide who were outside their home country for at least 12 months and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mainstreaming of Migration in Development Policy and Integrating Migration in the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/genericdocument/wcms_220084.pdf|website=www.ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries have millions of migrant workers. Some migrant workers may be [[illegal immigrant]]s. Some may be [[slaves]].

==United Nations' definition==
The "[[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]]"&lt;ref&gt;[[#UN|UN (1990)]]&lt;/ref&gt; defines migrant worker as follows:
{{cquote|The term "migrant worker" refers to a person who is engaged or has been engaged in a remunerated activity in a State of which he or she is not a national.}}
The Convention has been ratified by Mexico, Brazil, and the Philippines (among many other nations that supply foreign labour) but it has not been ratified by the United States, Germany, and Japan (among other nations that receive foreign labor).

==Worldwide perspectives==

===Canada===
Since the 1960s, farmers in Ontario and other provinces have been meeting some of their seasonal labour needs by hiring temporary workers from Caribbean countries and, since 1974, from Mexico under the Canadian [[Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program]] (CSAWP). This federal initiative allows for the organized entry into Canada of low- to mid-level skilled farm workers for up to eight months a year to fill labour shortages on Canadian farms during peak periods of planting, cultivating and harvesting of specified farm commodities. The program is run jointly with the governments of Mexico and the participating Caribbean states, which recruit the workers and appoint representatives in Canada to assist in the program's operations.&lt;ref&gt;Lois Ross, [http://www.nsi-ins.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2006-Migrant-Workers-in-Canada-A-review-of-the-Canadian-Seasonal-Agricultural-Workers-Program.pdf ''Migrant Workers in Canada: a review of the Canadian seasonal agricultural workers program''], ([[The North-South Institute]], 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, non-agricultural companies are beginning to recruit [[Temporary foreign worker program in Canada|temporary foreign worker]]s under [[Service Canada]]'s 2002 expansion of an immigration program for migrant workers.

As of 2002, the federal government introduced the Low Skill Pilot Project. This project allows companies to apply to bring in temporary foreign workers to fill low skill jobs. The classification of "low skill" means that workers require no more than high school or two years of job-specific training to qualify.

In 2006, the federal Conservatives expanded the list of occupations that qualified for the Low Skill Pilot Project and increased the speed of processing applications.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===China===
{{main|Mingong|Migration in China}}
[[File:Carrier.jpg|thumb|A Mingong is working in China]]
Overall, the [[Chinese government]] has tacitly supported migration as means of providing labour for factories and construction sites and for the long-term goals of [[Urbanization in the People's Republic of China|transforming China]] from a rural-based economy to an urban-based one.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''China Blue.'' Dir. Micha X. Peled. Teddy Bear Films. 2005. DVD&lt;/ref&gt; Some inland cities have started providing migrants with [[Social welfare in China|social security]], including pensions and other insurance.
In 2012, there were a reported 167 million migrant workers in China, with trends of working closer to home within their own or a neighbouring province but with a wage drop of 21%.
Because so many migrant workers are moving to the city from rural areas, employers can hire them to work in poor working conditions for low wages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Migrant workers in China are notoriously marginalized, especially due to the [[hukou system]] of residency permits, which tie one stated residence to all social welfare benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong|title=Rural migrant workers in urban China: living a marginalised life|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2397.2007.00475.x/full|publisher=International Journal of Social Welfare|accessdate=8 July 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/16/asia/china-migrant-children/&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The recent [[Enlargement of the European Union|expansions]] of the [[European Union]] have provided opportunities for many people to migrate to other EU countries for work. For both the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2004]] and [[Accession of Romania to the European Union|2007]] enlargements, existing [[Member State of the European Union|states]] were given the rights to impose various transitional arrangements to limit access to their labour markets. After the Second World War, Germany did not have enough workers so  laborers from other European states were invited to work in Germany. This invitation ended in 1973 and these workers were known as [[Gastarbeiter]].

1 March has become a symbolic day for transnational migrants' strike. This day unites all migrants to give them a common voice to speak up against racism, discrimination and exclusion on all levels of social life. The transnational protests on 1 March were originally initiated in the US in 2006 and have encouraged migrants in other countries to organise and take action on that day. In Austria the first transnational migrants' strike (''{{lang|de|Transnationaler Migrant innenstreik}}'') took place in March 2011, in the form of common actions, e.g. a manifestation, but also in form of numerous decentralised actions.

===Finland===
According to the Finnish trade union organizations SAK ([[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions]]) and PAM [[Finnish Service Union United PAM]] foreign workers were increasingly abused in the [[Construction worker|construction]] and [[Portal:Transport|transportation]] sectors in Finland in 2012, in some cases reporting hourly wages as low as two euros. [[Bulgarians]], [[List of Kosovars|Kosovars]] and [[Estonians]] were the most likely victimised in the building trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/unions_foreign_workers_often_underpaid_overworked/6479057 Unions: Foreign workers often underpaid, overworked] [[yle]] 4 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
There has been a substantial flow of people from Bangladesh and Nepal to India over recent decades in search of better work. Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] found that these migrant workers are often subject to [[harassment]], violence, and discrimination during their journeys at their destinations and when they return home.&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, F. et al. (2012) Stories of harassment, violence and discrimination: migrant experiences between India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Overseas Development Institute Briefing Paper http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/6087-migration-india-nepal-bangladesh-harassment-violence-discrimination&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladeshi women appear to be particularly vulnerable. These findings highlight the need to promote migrants' rights with, among others, health staff, police and employers  at destination.

===Indonesia===
{{further|Indonesian migrant worker}}
The population of Indonesia, as the world's fourth largest, has contributed to the surplus of work forces. Combined with a scarcity of jobs at home, this has led numbers of [[Native Indonesians|Indonesians]] to seek job abroad. It is estimated around 4.5&amp;nbsp;million Indonesians work abroad, 70% of them are women, most are employed in domestic sector as maid and in manufacture sector. Most of them aged between 18 and 35 years old. Around 30% are men, mostly work in plantation, construction, transportation and service sector.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that these are official numbers, the actual numbers might be far larger contributed by unrecorded illegal entry of Indonesian workers into foreign countries. They are prone to exploitation, extortion, physical and sexual abuses, suffered by those enduring [[human trafficking]]. Several cases of abuses upon Indonesian migrant worker has been reported and some has gained worldwide attention.

===Latin America===
Immigrants often take any job is available and often they find employment in the fields. When they finally do find jobs they usually consist of hard manual labour along with unfair pay. In the article "Migrant Farmworkers: Is government doing enough to protect them?” by William Triplett, Triplett describes that the “median annual income was $7,500, and 61 percent had income below the poverty level” (Triplett). After losing their cultural identity immigrants try to find the way to feed their families and end up being exploited. The study by William Triplett describes the annual income to be about 7,500 dollars, or about 625 dollars a month. Triplett also mentions that since 1989, “their average real hourly wages (in 1998 dollars) had dropped from $6.89 to $6.18” One cannot expect to live a healthy life making this kind of money. The pursuit of happiness must not apply to all humans as stated in the constitution. Without help immigrants will constantly be forced to work horrible labour jobs for little to no money.  Although battles have been fought for betting the wages researchers found that they have actually decreased. As the cost of living has increased the average pay for a migrant farm worker has actually decreased. Along with economic exploitation in the work place immigrants also suffer from physical exploitation in the work place.

In Seventh Malaysia Plan (1995–2000), Malaysia's total population increased by 2.3 percent a year, while foreign residents (non-citizens) covers 7.6 percent of the total working-age population in Malaysia, not including illegal foreign residents. In 2008 majority of migrant workers (1,085,658: 52.6%) come from their country of origin Indonesia and followed by Bangladesh (316,401), Philippine (26,713), Thailand (21,065) and Pakistan (21,278). Meanwhile, number of migrant workers from other countries is (591,481). Their arrival, if not controlled, will decrease the local population's employment opportunities. However, the arrival of migrant workers was able to increase the country's output and reduce the rate of wages in the local labor market. Despite the benefits received by both the sending and receiving countries, many problems arise in the receiving country, Malaysia. The actual number of how many migrant workers in Malaysia right now is very difficult to identify. The number of legally to work with a passport and work permit certain can be identified.

More than a million Filipinos every year leave to work abroad through overseas employment agencies, and other programs, including government-sponsored initiatives.

===Singapore===
Since the late 1970s Singapore has become one of the major receiving countries of migrant workers in Southeast Asia with 1,340,300 foreign workers constituting 37% of the total workforce in December 2014.&lt;ref name="mom.gov.sg"&gt;Ministry of Manpower. 2015, 12 March. Foreign Workforce Numbers. Retrieved from http://www.mom.gov.sg/statistics-publications/others/statistics/pages/foreignworkforcenumbers.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Manpower. 2015, 12 March. Employment. Retrieved from http://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Employment-Summary-Table.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It is the highest proportion of foreign labour force in Asia. About 991,300 of these foreign workers fall under the category of unskilled or low-skilled.&lt;ref name="mom.gov.sg"/&gt;  Currently, there are 322,700 male construction workers and 222,500 are female domestic workers in Singapore.&lt;ref name="mom.gov.sg"/&gt; They are from different countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and Thailand. In order to control the larger amount of these labours, Singapore implemented clear migration policies with visa categories available for all skill levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Piper|first=Nicola|title=Migrant Labor in Southeast Asia|location=Asia Research Institute National University of Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of foreign domestic workers is controlled through strict enforcement of a "guestworker policy of transience". The employers are required to post a S$5,000 bond with the Government to guarantee the worker's repatriation at the end of her two-year work permit. The government controls the entire realm of migrant workers with this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeoh|first=Brenda S.A.|title=Global Cities, Transnational Flows and Gender Dimensions, The View From Singapore|year=2000|publisher=The Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG|location=Department of Geography, University of merica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
Like many nations, South Korea started as a labour exporter in the 1960s before its economic development in the 1980s changed it to a labor importer.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Yoo |title=Foreign Workers in the Republic of Korea |url=http://www.jil.go.jp/foreign/countryreport/2005_1107/korea_e.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127100610/http://www.jil.go.jp//foreign/countryreport/2005_1107/korea_e.pdf |archivedate=27 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1993, the Industrial Trainee Program was established to meets the needs of migrant workers. It provided work for foreigners as trainees in small and medium-sized businesses. However, these workers were considered trainees and not official employees, so they could not receive protection under Korean labour laws. On 14 February 1995 Guidelines for the Protection and Management of Foreign Industrial Trainees provided legal and social welfare for migrant workers. The Act on the Employment of Foreign Workers which states that “a foreign worker shall not be given discriminatory treatment on the ground that he/she is a foreigner”, was put into force on 16 August 2003. Later that year the numbers of migrant workers multiplied dramatically.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Even though there has been a drastic rise of migrant workers in Korea and policies are in place for their protection, the lack of cheap labour in Korea has forced the Korean community to condone the maltreatment of illegal migrant workers, and other unsavoury practices. In response, the Korean government has increased the quota for migrant workers by 5,000, to 62,000 individuals in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrantok.org/english/viewtopic.php?t=629&amp;sid=69cfbdaa991e8f3f6f5f0df94484addd|title=MigrantWorkers Center :: View topic – 62,000 foreign workers will come to Korea in 2013 (an increase of 5,000 laborers over 2012)|work=migrantok.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, on 31 January 2013, the minimum wage for migrant workers increased to 38,880 KRW for eight hours per day or a monthly rate of 1,015,740 KRW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrantok.org/english/viewtopic.php?t=648|title=MigrantWorkers Center :: View topic&amp;nbsp;– South Korea increases minimum wage for workers|work=migrantok.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Programs were put into place to protect migrant workers and ease their integration to Korean society. Programs sponsored by the government such as Sejonghakdang (세종학당), Multicultural Center of Gender Equality and Family Program, Foreign Ministry Personnel Center Program, and Ministry of Justice Social Integration Program provide free Korean language lessons for migrant workers. In addition, by fulfilling all the requirements of the Ministry of Justice Social Integration Program, migrant workers can apply for Korean citizenship without taking the Naturalization exams.

===Sweden===
Since December 2008, Sweden has more liberal rules for labor immigration from 'third countries' – countries outside the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) – than any other country in OECD. The introduction of employer-driven labor immigration, motivated by the need to address labor shortages, resulted in large inflows of migrants also in low-skilled occupations in labor surplus sectors, for example the restaurant and cleaning sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Olle Frödin &amp; Anders Kjellberg (2018) [http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/40268826/Labor_Migration_from_Third_Countries_to_Swedish_Low_wage_Jobs_Fr_din_Kjellberg.pdf  Labor Migration from Third Countries to Swedish Low-wage Jobs], ''Nordic Journal of Working Life Studies'', vol. 8 no 1 (March 2018), pp. 65-85&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Taiwan===
As of June 2016, there are more than 600,000 migrant workers in Taiwan which are spread across different sectors of industry, ranging from construction workers, domestic helpers, factory workers and other manual jobs. Most of them come from Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201608290029.aspx|title=Number of migrant workers in Taiwan tops 600,000 – Society – FOCUS TAIWAN – CNA ENGLISH NEWS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
In Thailand, migrants come from bordering countries such as Burma, Laos and Cambodia. Many face hardships such as lack of food, abuse, and low wages. Often deportation is their biggest fear. In Bangkok, Thailand many migrant workers attend [[Dear Burma]] school where they study subjects such as [[Thai language]], [[Burmese language]], English language, computer skills and photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/328396/a-rare-chance-to-learn|title=A rare chance to learn|author=Post Publishing PCL.|work=bangkokpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Arab Emirates===
{{main|Migrant workers in the United Arab Emirates}}
The treatment of migrant workers in the [[UAE]] has been likened to "modern-day slavery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/world/modern-day-slave-labor-conditions-abu-dhabis-migrant-workers-shame-west|title=Modern Day Slave Labor: Conditions for Abu Dhabi's Migrant Workers Shame the West}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migrant workers are excluded from the UAE's collective labour rights, hence migrants are vulnerable to forced labour.

Those who protest risk prison and deportation.&lt;ref name=mig/&gt; The [[International Trade Union Confederation]] has called on the United Nations to investigate evidence that thousands of migrant workers in the UAE are treated as slave labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/13/migrant-workers-uae-gulf-states-un-ituc|title=Call for UN to investigate plight of migrant workers in the UAE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] have drawn attention to the mistreatment of migrant workers who have been turned into debt-ridden ''de facto'' [[indentured servant]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Keane | first1 = D. | last2 = McGeehan | first2 = N. | doi = 10.1163/138548708X272537 | title = Enforcing Migrant Workers' Rights in the United Arab Emirates | journal = International Journal on Minority and Group Rights | volume = 15 | pages = 81–115 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; following their arrival in the UAE.

Although attempts have been made since 2009 to enforce a midday break rule, these are frequently flouted. Those labourers who do receive a midday break often have no suitable place to rest and tend to seek relief in bus or taxi stands and gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/midday-break-to-be-strictly-enforced|title=Midday Break To Be Strictly Enforced|publisher=thenational.ae|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiatives taken have brought about a huge impact on the conditions of the laborers. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], migrant workers in Dubai live in "inhumane" conditions.


===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]] migrant workers are denied [[National Health Service]] treatment unless they can afford to pay.  Untreated illnesses can worsen and migrant workers can die from treatable illnesses that remain untreated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/13/nhs-denied-treatment-for-migrants-who-cant-afford-upfront-charges NHS denied treatment for migrants who can’t afford upfront charges] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Female migrant worker==
According to the International Labour Organization, 48 per cent of all international migrants are women and they are increasingly migrating for work purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Setting A Fair Migration Agenda|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_242879.pdf|website=www.ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe alone there are 3 million female migrant workers. The 1970s and 1980s have seen an increase in female migrant labourers in France and Belgium. In China, as of 2015 a third of their migrant workers were women&lt;ref&gt;AsiaFoundation.

[[File:Migrant agricultural worker's family, Nipomo, California ppmsca03054u.jpg|thumb|Migrant agricultural worker's family, California, 1936]]
Women migrate in search of work for a number of reasons and the most common reasons are economic: the husband's wage is no longer enough to support the family. In some places, like China, for instance, rapid economic growth has led to an imbalance in the modernization of rural and urban environments, leading women to migrate from rural areas into the city to be a part of the push for modernization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other reasons include familial pressure, on a daughter, for instance, who is seen as a reliable source of income for the family only through [[remittance]]s. Young girls and women are singled out in families to be migrant workers because they don't have a viable alternative role to fulfil in the local village.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''The Mosuo Sisters.'' Dir. by Marlo Poras. Perf. La Tsuo, Jua Ma. 2012. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; If they go to work in the urban centres as domestic workers they can send home money to help provide for their younger siblings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many of these women come from developing countries, and are low skilled.&lt;ref&gt;[[Women Migrant Workers from Developing Countries]]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally women who are widowed or divorced and have limited economic opportunities in their native country may be forced to leave out of economic necessity. Migration can also substitute for divorce in societies that don't allow or do not condone divorce.&lt;ref name="Morokvasic"/&gt;

===Impact on roles within the family===
In terms of migrant labour, many women move from a more oppressive home country to a less oppressive environment where they have actual access to waged work. As such, leaving the home and obtaining increased economic independence and freedom challenges traditional [[gender roles]]. This can be seen to strengthen women's position in the family by improving their relative bargaining position. They have more leverage in controlling the household because they have control over a degree of economic assets. However, this can lead to hostility between wives and husbands who feel inadequate or ashamed at their inability to fulfil their traditional role as [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]]. The hostility and resentment from the husband can also be a source of [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Menjívar|Menjívar (1999)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also been done which point to changes in family structures as a result of migrant labour. These changes include increased divorce rates and decrease in household stability. Additionally, female migrant labour has been indicated as a source for more egalitarian relationships within the family, decline of extended family patterns, and more nuclear families.&lt;ref name="Morokvasic"/&gt; There is also a risk for infidelity abroad, which also erodes the family structure.&lt;ref name="Parle"&gt;[[#Parle|de Parle (2007)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers identified three groups of women to represent the dimensions of gender roles in Singapore. The first group is made up of expatriate wives who are often reduced to dependent spouse status by immigration laws. The second group are housewives who left work in order to take care of the children at home. Although they are from the Singaporean middle class, they are stuck at almost the same level and share status with the third group, foreign domestic workers. Because of global economic restructuring and global city formation, the mobility of female labours is increasing. However, they are controlled through strict enforcement and they are statistically invisible in migration data. The female foreign domestic workers are always gender-stereotyped as maids and generalized as low wages workers in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeoh|first=Brenda S.A.|title=Global Cities, Transnational Flows and Gender Dimensions, The View From Singapore|year=2000|publisher=Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG|location=Department of Geography, University of Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children of female migrant workers===
[[File:8c35333.jpg|thumb|Group of Florida migrants near [[Shawboro, North Carolina]] on their way to [[Cranbury, New Jersey]], to pick potatoes]]
Migrant labour of women also raises special concerns about children. Female migrant workers may not have enough possibilities to care for their own children whilst being abroad. Their children may learn to regard their relatives at home as their parents and may rarely see their mothers. Frequently, children of migrant workers become migrant workers themselves. There is concern that this may have negative psychological effects on the children who are left behind. Although this has not been proven to be entirely true or false, studies have been done which show that many children of migrant workers manage reasonably well. One theory states that remittances to some degree make up for the lack of care by providing more resources for food and clothing. Additionally, some migrant mothers take great care in attempting to maintain familial relationships while abroad.&lt;ref name="Parle"/&gt;

==Migrant education==
''See [[Migrant education]].''
[[File:A school for the children of white migrant farm workers is maintained at the Osceola Farm Labor Supply Center... - NARA - 512800.tif|upright=1.8|thumb|A school for the children of white migrant farm workers, circa 1945]]
Children of [[migrant workers]] struggle to achieve the same level of educational success as their peers. Relocation, whether it is a singular or regular occurrence, causes discontinuity in education, which causes migrant students to progress slowly through school and drop out at high rates. Additionally, relocation has negative social consequences on students: isolation from peers due to cultural differences and [[language barrier]]s. Migrant children are also at a disadvantage because the majority live in [[extreme poverty]] and must work with their parents to support their families.&lt;ref name=Kindler&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kindler |first=Anneka L.|year=1995 |title=Education of Migrant Children in the United States|journal=[[Directions in Language and Education]] |volume=1 |issue=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These barriers to equal educational attainment for children of migrant workers are present in countries all over the world. Although the inequality in education remains pronounced, government policies, [[non-governmental organizations]], [[non-profits]], and [[social movements]] are working to reverse its effects.

==Migrant labour force in economy==
The migrant workforce has historically played a vital role nationally and across local communities in recent times. [[Economic globalization]] has created more migrant workers than ever before. While developed countries have increased their demand for labour, especially unskilled labour, workers from developing countries are used. As a result, millions of workers and their families travel to other countries to find work. This influx of migrant workers contributes to growth of [[slum]]s and urban poverty, according to Mike Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Mike|title=Planet of Slums|year=2006|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these workers, usually from rural areas, cannot afford housing in cities and thus live in slums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Todaro|first=Michael P.|title=A Model of Labor Migration and Urban Unemployment in Less Developed Countries|journal=The American Economic Review|year=1969|volume=59|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these unskilled workers living in slums suffer from unemployment and make a living in the [[informal sector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Indrani|author2=Arup Mitra|title=Rural Migrants and Labour Segmentation: Micro-Level Evidence from Delhi Slums|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|year=2002|volume=37|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to International Labor Organization, as of 2013 there were approximately 175 million migrants around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Labour Organization (ILO)|first=International|title=Migrant Workers|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/subjects-covered-by-international-labour-standards/migrant-workers/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Standards|accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exploitation and enslavement of migrant workers==
{{see also|Human trafficking}}

Recruitment of international workers through employment agencies is a common phenomenon in developed countries, such as the United States or the [[UAE]]. Especially members of underprivileged communities are attracked by the opportunities of living and working in the US. Some of these agencies make fraudulent promises. But even worse than false promises, some migrants are abused and mistreated by the agencies and their middlemen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Twohey, Megan. "Wanted: Foreign Workers — and the Labor Brokers Accused of Illegally Profiting from Them." Reuters. Thomson Reuters, (1–10).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="I Already Bought You"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/10/22/i-already-bought-you/abuse-and-exploitation-female-migrant-domestic-workers-united|title="I Already Bought You"|date=22 October 2014|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-05-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some migrant workers may have their passports and mobile phones confiscated, are imprisoned in the employer's home or at least strictly overseen and disconnected from society, friends and family; some may not receive their full wage and have to work unrestrained long hours without breaks or days off. Migrant workers may also be denied adequate food and living conditions, as well as medical treatment.&lt;ref name="I Already Bought You"/&gt;

In a study done by the [[Human Rights Watch]] of 99 domestic workers in the [[United Arab Emirates]], 22 alleged that their sponsors had physically abused them.&lt;ref name="I Already Bought You"/&gt; Workers refuse to report their abuse due to fear of deportation and not being able to find a better job. It is common in some cases for a woman to fall victim to sexual violence and harassment, because the employers and their stories will always be trusted more.&lt;ref name="I Already Bought You"/&gt;

Some migrant workers flee from their abusive employers and seek help at the embassy or consulate of their home country. This however, is difficult to achieve in remote locations.&lt;ref name="I Already Bought You"/&gt;

=== Indian Migrant Workers ===
A United States Company, [[Signal International]], led by an immigration lawyer, Malvern C. Burnett, and an Indian labor recruiter, Sachin Dewan, "lured hundreds of Indian workers to a Mississippi shipyard with false promises of permanent US residency."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/exploited-indian-workers-in-us-awarded-14-million/16005172|title=Exploited Indian workers in US awarded $14&amp;nbsp;million|work=mid-day|access-date=2017-05-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was under the [[H-2B visa]] guest worker program, to work as welders, pipefitters, and in other positions to repair damaged oil rigs and related facilities. Each worker paid the labor recruiters between $10,000 and $20,000 or more in recruitment fees and other costs after being promised good jobs, [[Permanent residence (United States)|green cards]], and permanent U.S. residency. Some went deep into debt.&lt;ref name="newsindiatimes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsindiatimes.com/u-s-company-to-pay-20-m-to-exploited-indian-guest-workers|title=U.S. Company To Pay $20 M To Exploited Indian Guest Workers – News India Times|website=www.newsindiatimes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "On arrival at Signal shipyards in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]], beginning in 2006, they discovered that they wouldn't receive the green cards or permanent residency, and that in fact, each would have to pay $1,050 a month to live in isolated, guarded labor camps where as many as 24 men shared a space the size of a double-wide trailer."&lt;ref name="newsindiatimes.com"/&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Conviction&lt;/u&gt;

Signal International Company "had to compensate workers $14.4&amp;nbsp;million in a jury ruling to five Indian guest workers, one of the largest settlements of its kind in U.S. history. The ruling was based on the finding that the company and its agents engaged in labor trafficking, fraud, racketeering and discrimination, News India Times reported at that time. The jury also found that one of the plaintiffs was a victim of false imprisonment and retaliation."&lt;ref name="newsindiatimes.com"/&gt;

=== Philippines migrant workers ===
There have been many cases of corruption among brokers who often act as if they have companies, often encouraging migrants to come to the United States. This was the case with broker, Kizzy Kalu was, "a naturalized United States citizen from Nigeria".&lt;ref name="denverpost.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/11/highlands-ranch-man-sentenced-to-11-years-in-human-trafficking-case/|title=Highlands Ranch man sentenced to 11 years in human trafficking case – The Denver Post|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "He secured government approval to bring in Filipino nurses under a government visa program, claiming they would be paid up to $72,000 as instructors at an Adam University in Colorado, according to a 2012 criminal indictment of the labor broker."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Adams State University]] did exist in Colorado, however Adam University was nonexistent just as much as the jobs that were supposed to be there for migrants. "Kalu promised the nurses, most from the Philippines, jobs as nurse instructors/supervisors."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2013/07/01/jury-finds-kalu-guilty-of-human-trafficking/|title=Jury finds Kalu guilty of human trafficking – The Denver Post|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "He arranged with the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security to provide H-1B visas for the workers, saying that Adam University faced a labor shortage and needed foreign labor to serve as nursing instructors/supervisors," as a way to lure workers in.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Kizzy Kalu&amp;nbsp;and "other foreign nationals" received compensation for these visas after they secured and received them for the soon to be workers. "Kalu $6,500 for assistance in obtaining them. Upon arrival in Denver, Colorado, the nurses were told that there was no such place as Adam University. Instead, they were sent to "work in nursing homes. The facilities paid Kalu's company, Foreign Health Care Professionals Group, $35 per hour for one of the nurses. Kalu then pocketed almost half the wage and paid the nurse $20 an hour."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; He continued to exploit these workers by allowing them to work while he was the one gaining their profit. He had to report to the government about these women and that they were in fact working in the country so that he could continue to receive funds, while they too continued working. And that is what he did. "Documents he submitted to the government didn't indicate that he and his partner, Philip Langerman, were taking a large portion of the visa-holders' wages."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Eventually, this scheme that Kalu and his partner Phillip Langerman created began to become known to the public. Instead of the facilities paying the company they had created together from the work the women were doing, "the nurses were paid directly by the facilities but were required to pay Kalu $1,200 a month or Kalu would send a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and they would lose their visas, prosecutors said."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Soon, the nurses realized this kind of unfair treatment and mode of oppression and stopped paying him. Therefore, their visas got revoked because he reported this matter to officials.

&lt;u&gt;Conviction&lt;/u&gt;

Kizzy Kalu was guilty of "trafficking in forced labor for luring foreign nurses to the United States with promises of high-paying jobs but then demanding they kick back a portion of their wages or face deportation."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; He was sentenced to nearly 11 years in prison and ordered to pay $3.8&amp;nbsp;million in restitution.&amp;nbsp;He was convicted of 89 counts of mail fraud, visa fraud, human trafficking and money laundering. Kalu's partner, Philip Langerman, 78, of McDonough, Ga., was sentenced to three years of probation for his role in the criminal scheme. He, too, must pay restitution of $3.8&amp;nbsp;million." U.S. District Chief Judge [[Marcia S. Krieger|Marcia Krueger]] said in this case unlike many others, "Kalu did not sexually assault, isolate or strike his victims. She describe these cases as "fraud and economic coercion."&lt;ref name="denverpost.com"/&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Other Cases&lt;/u&gt;

There are other fraudulent cases by United States companies that recruit and employ Filipino workers. On 19 March 2013, in an article titled, "Filipino Workers Urge Overhaul of U.S. Guest Worker Policies", information is provided about the corruption in labor. "The shipyard, Grand Isle Shipyard (GIS) in L.A., put the Filipinos to work on an oil production platform owned by Black Elk Energy, a U.S. company that, according to federal regulators, had racked up 315 documented "incidents of safety non-compliance" offshore since 2010.The problems at Black Elk Energy were amplified following an explosion in November on a platform in the Gulf of Mexico that claimed the lives of three Filipino workers, while three others were seriously injured."&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/03/filipino-workers-urge-overhaul-of-u-s-guest-worker-policies/|title=Filipino Workers Urge Overhaul of U.S. Guest Worker Policies {{!}} Inter Press Service|website=www.ipsnews.net|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem became known because the work at this company against workers were very dangerous even before they were hired which is why work here was put to a stop. However this did not stop GIS. They needed to make their money and unfortunately the migrant workers were the ones who suffered.

“The main [hazardous condition] is the sleep deprivation that they experience – just long hours of work that the [U.S.] workers don't face. They're forced to work sometimes for two weeks straight, 70 hours a week."&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net"/&gt; They hired and recruited many skillful men from the Philippines who were "welders, pipefitters and scaffolders were trafficked under "fraudulent" contracts that promised high pay and safe working conditions. But many were placed for work on dangerous oil rig platforms."&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net"/&gt;

&lt;u&gt;The Filipino Government&lt;/u&gt;

"The Philippine government has long lauded the fact that, every day, some 4,500 Filipinos are sent abroad to work. The remittances they send back keeps the Philippine economy afloat.The government doesn't seem to provide any protection when these overseas Filipino workers run into distress. This labour export policy is still one of their pillars of development – pushing people to other countries instead of addressing poverty or lack of jobs at home."&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net"/&gt; Instead of sending workers out just because the process helps the economy at their countries of origin, the country needs to examine ways in which they can work with the people to obtain jobs or at least create more jobs. When their skilled workers come to the United States and are often exploited, sexually, physically and mentally it not only affects the worker, but also the country upon their return-or if they are able to return at all due to the conditions they face. These are risky jobs and journeys taken by migrants to ensure themselves better lives and also their families. The governments need to do more. "The exploitative immigration system of the U.S. works hand-in-hand with the corrupt labour export policy of the Philippines to maintain a steadily increasing flow of cheap, temporary migrant labour."&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net"/&gt;

=== Mexico migrant workers  ===
Since the early 1980s, increasing numbers of Mexican women have migrated to the United States in search of jobs. These women usually leave their families, including young children, behind in order to help maintain the family by sending [[remittance]]s. After arriving in the U.S. they are put to work and live in places that are neither clean nor safe. Companies and traffickers promise legitimate jobs in America because they make money doing so. The Americans who exploit and enslave these people reinforce ideas of colonialism and imperialism.

An article "Girl Next Door," by Peter Landsman examines this brutal and inhumane system of oppression towards migrant workers. "On a tip, the Plainfield police raided the house in February 2002, expecting to find illegal aliens working an underground brothel. What the police found were four girls between the ages of 14 and 17. They were all Mexican nationals without documentation. But they weren't prostitutes; they were sex slaves. The distinction is important: these girls weren't working for profit or a paycheck. They were captives to the traffickers and keepers who controlled their every move."&lt;ref name="Landesman, Peter 2004"&gt;Landesman, Peter. 2004. The Girls Next Door. New York Times Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; These girls, a large percentage are underaged, are forcefully lured from their homeland in Mexico and other parts of Latin America. This section mainly focused on the exploitation of men and women however, it was very disturbing to even learn that children were also trafficked and stolen from their homelands.

"They had been promised jobs as models and baby sitters in the glamorous United States, and they probably had no idea why they were sitting in a van in a backwater like Tijuana in the early evening."&lt;ref name="Landesman, Peter 2004"/&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Conditions Girls Were Kept In&lt;/u&gt;

"The police found a squalid, land-based equivalent of a 19th-century slave ship." There were doorless bathrooms, decaying sinks and mattresses, morning after pills (medications that can induce abortion) and girls were pale, exhausted and malnourished.&lt;ref name="Landesman, Peter 2004"/&gt; However, this is just an example of one of the apartments and houses that were affected by this type of abuses. Many other houses or neighborhoods  in the U.S that seem to be upscale and upperclass are infested with these types of illegal actions.

==Migrant workers' rights==
The "People's Movement for Human Rights Education (PDHRE)" have composed a list of fourteen rights for migrant workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=The People's Movement for Human Rights Education (PDHRE)|title=Human Rights and Migrant Workers|url=http://www.pdhre.org/rights/migrants.html|publisher=Shulamith Koenig|accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on migrant workers' health==
Monica Rosales (a professor from Colorado State University) describes work-related injuries in her journal article titled "Life in the field: Migrant farm workers’ perceptions of work related injuries”. Rosales discusses bone problems, respiratory problems and allergic reactions all in relation to the migrant farm work that immigrants do to make money. Rosales discussed how these working conditions affect the lives of immigrants. Rosales states that “The average life expectancy of migrant and seasonal farm workers is 49 years of age, in comparison to the U.S. average of 75 years of age”.&lt;ref&gt;(Rosales 4)&lt;/ref&gt; On top of unfair{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=February 2017}} wages, migrant workers often find themselves toiling in dangerous working conditions. The life expectancy compared to average is 26 years less for a migrant worker in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, Monica S. "Life in the Field: Migrant Farm Workers' Perceptions of Work Related Injuries." Colorado State University, 2008. United States – Colorado: ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses (PQDT). Web. 7 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey by Lien Centre for Social Innovation in Singapore also found that over 60 per cent of lower-skilled South Asian migrant workers who are waiting for salary or injury compensation from employers were predicted to have serious [[mental illness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Seow|first1=Joanna|title=Most migrant South Asian workers face mental health issues as they await claims settlement|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/most-migrant-south-asian-workers-face-mental-health-issues-as-they-await-claims|access-date=1 December 2015|publisher=Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of migrant seasonal agricultural workers who are employed in one of the most hazardous occupations in Turkey experience difficulties in accessing health-care services. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Öztaş|first=Dilek|last2=Kurt|first2=Burak|last3=Koç|first3=Ayşegül|last4=Akbaba|first4=Muhsin|date=2018-07-03|title=Living Conditions, Access to Healthcare Services, and Occupational Health and Safety Conditions of Migrant Seasonal Agricultural Workers in the Çukurova Region|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2018.1470048|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=262–269|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1470048|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National vs. transnational migrations==
Like transnational migration, national (internal) migration plays an important role in poverty reduction and economic development. For some countries, internal migrants outnumber those who migrate internationally. For example, 120 million people were estimated to migrate internally in China compared to 458,000 people who migrated internationally for work.&lt;ref name="prb"&gt;[[#Deshingkar|Deshingkar &amp; Grimm (2005)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Situations of surplus labour in rural areas because of scarcity of arable land is a common "push factor" in the move of individuals to urban-based industries and service jobs. Environmental factors including drought, [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]], and river-bank erosion also contribute to internal migration.&lt;ref name="prb"/&gt;

There are four spatial patterns of internal migration:&lt;ref name="prb"/&gt;
# Rural-rural migration: in many poor countries like Senegal, rural-rural migration occurs when labourers from poorer regions travel to agriculturally-rich and irrigated areas which have more work.
# Rural-urban migration: seen in the urbanizing economies of Asia, migration of poor agricultural workers move to larger cities and manufacturing centers.
# Urban-rural migration: migration that occurs when individuals retire back to their villages. Often, migrants who return bring back skill sets that benefit their home areas tremendously.
# Urban-urban migration: as the predominant form of internal migration, this movement takes place from the centre of towns to the outer areas of the town.

[[Circular migration]], the temporary and repetitive movement of a migrant worker between home and host areas, can occur both internally and transnationally.

'''''Modinos v. Cyprus''''' 16 EHRR 485 (25 March 1993) is a judgment of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] concerning [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

== Case ==
The case was initiated by Alexandros Modinos, a gay rights activist who had founded ''Apeleftherotiko Kinima Omofilofilon Kiprou'' (AKOK), or "Cypriot Gay Liberation Movement", in 1987.  At the time, Modinos was involved in a sexual relationship with another male adult, and claimed to suffer great strain, apprehension, and fear of prosecution by reason of [[Section 171 of the Criminal Code of Cyprus]], which criminalized certain homosexual acts.

==Judgment==
The court ruled by 8 votes to one that the existence of a prohibition continuously and directly affected the applicant’s private life, thus there was an interference with his right to respect for private life. As the Government limited their submissions to maintaining that there was no interference, and did not seek to argue that there existed a justification under Article 8(2) for the impugned legal provisions, the Court did not find that&amp;mdash;in the light of the above-mentioned fact and having regard to the its judgment in ''[[Dudgeon v. United Kingdom]]'' and ''[[Norris v. Ireland]]''&amp;mdash;a re-examination of the question was called for.

'''[[Moscow University]] Herbarium''' ('''MW''') is the second largest [[herbarium]] in [[Russia]] after the [[Komarov Institute]] (LE).{{fact|date=October 2017}}

The herbarium is focused on the flora of temperate [[Eurasia]] with an emphasis on the flora of Russia.{{fact|date=October 2017}} The collections of MW include 1,030,669 specimens (incl. ca. 5K type specimens) [http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=125298] (62nd place in the world's ranking) representing 37,100 species and subspecies of vascular plants and 2,223 species and subspecies of bryophytes. MW holds some important historical collections by G.F. Hoffmann, J.F. Ehrhart, C.B. Trinius, J.R. and J.G.A. Forsters, etc.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

The Moscow University Herbarium added a millionth specimen to the collections in June 2016.{{fact|date=October 2017}} An average annual growth of the collection in 2005–2016 was 15,100 specimens, with an exceptional 22,013 specimens added to the herbarium in 2016.{{fact|date=October 2017}} Since 2005, major accessions originated from [[Eastern Europe]], [[Siberia]] and [[Russian Far East]], the [[Caucasus]], and [[South Asia]] (vascular plants); [[Taymyr Peninsula|Taimyr]], Russian Far East, and North Caucasus (bryophytes).

The Moscow University Herbarium has gained budget for the digitisation of collections within the Program of the National Depository Bank of Live Systems, and around 911,000 specimens (89%) were scanned since May 2015. All these records are published already online,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://plant.depo.msu.ru/ | title=Национальный банк-депозитарий живых систем | website=plant.depo.msu.ru | publisher=[[Moscow State University]] | accessdate=15 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including JPG images and metadata required for indexing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite| url=https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=29008518 | title=ГЕРБАРИЙ МОСКОВСКОГО УНИВЕРСИТЕТА (MW) СЕГОДНЯ: ФОНДЫ, ОНЛАЙН ДОСТУП И НАУЧНАЯ РАБОТА | website=elibrary.ru | accessdate=15 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the Moscow Digital Herbarium holds the largest digitised herbarium collections from Russia, Ukraine, Mongolia, Georgia, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, Latvia, as well as from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. Also, Moscow Digital Herbarium is the second largest hub of digitised herbarium collections from Armenia, Lithuania, North Korea, Mali and the third largest for Cyprus and Vietnam [https://www.gbif.org/dataset/902c8fe7-8f38-45b0-854e-c324fed36303].

The '''National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame''' is a [[hall of fame]] established in 2013 to honor [[LGBT]] and allied personalities and organizations "whose achievements and efforts have enhanced sports and athletics for the gay and lesbian community". It was established shortly after [[Jason Collins]] became the first openly gay NBA player. It is located on the grounds of [[Center on Halsted]] in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-01/news/ct-met-gay-athlete-fame-20130501_1_gay-athletes-fame-special-section|title = National gay athlete hall of fame launched in Chicago|date = May 1, 2013|author = Ellen Jean Hirst|publisher = Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5999">The '''November 1897 proclamation''' of the State Trades and Labor Council of Montana was a reflection of western labor's assessment of the struggle between labor and capital after the failed [[Leadville Colorado, Miners' Strike]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, pages 71-87.&lt;/ref&gt; The proclamation, and the impetus behind it had a significant impact on the labor movement in the United States, Canada, and other countries for a period of several decades.

==The Leadville miners' strike==

The Cloud City Miners' Union (CCMU), Local 33 of the [[Western Federation of Miners]] (WFM), declared a strike over wage cuts in the [[Leadville mining district]] in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The CCMU wasn't adequately prepared for the opposition that it faced from the [[Mine Owners' Association]] and its allies.&lt;ref&gt;William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The defeat prompted the WFM to rethink its goals, its methods, and its ideology.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==History==

The Butte Miners' Union (BMU) was Local Number One of the Western Federation of Miners. The BMU dominated the WFM in its early days, but control later passed to Colorado.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Michael P. Malone, William L. Lang, The Battle for Butte, 2006, page 79.&lt;/ref&gt; While the WFM developed a reputation for radical politics and militancy in Idaho and Colorado, labor relations in Montana were more amicable.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

By 1895, the BMU and other labor affiliates had formed the statewide State Trades and Labor Council in Montana. Butte's labor-management harmony lasted through much of the 1890s, but did not survive the industrial consolidations that arrived with the turn of the century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==The proclamation==

The 1897 proclamation argued that the old form of labor organization could not compete with "plutocracy".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, page 82.&lt;/ref&gt; It declared that employers' interests were "always antagonizing" toward organized labor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Labor organizations in the eastern part of [[North America]] were described as having an "incapacity" to assist labor organizations in the West.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The proclamation described "an absolute rejection" of the [[American Federation of Labor]], of its conservative philosophy and its complacent demeanor.&lt;ref&gt;William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, page 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The proclamation proposed organizing western laborers and western unions into a new federation.&lt;ref&gt;William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, pages 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt; The new federation was necessary to reflect the growing [[class consciousness]] of many Western labor organizations and their members.&lt;ref&gt;William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, pages 71,83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;All That Glitters&amp;mdash;Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the proclamation==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To: Organized Labor Throughout the West:
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Greeting—Believing that the time has arrived when an epoch will be marked in the history of labor, and believing that the necessities of the times as evidenced in recent developments emphasizes the fact that the old form of organization is unable to cope with the recent aggressions of plutocracy . . . ; and feeling the incapacity of organized labor of the east to aid us any in resisting these threatened encroachments . . . therefore the State Trades and Labor Council of Montana . . . would urge the {{sic|necesity}} of concentrating and consolidating our forces, and would urge the organization under one head, of all unions west of . . . the Mississippi river . . . as at present our force and our means is dissipated, availing us but little. By combining our expense and our efforts to the support of one organization we concentrate our strength and strengthen our resources; furthermore we dissociate ourselves from . . . the older organizations and insure a unity and harmony of purpose among ourselves.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the west nature has located its great mine of wealth, here are unlimited and varied natural resources. In the east society has located a class who subsist upon our revenues, and a class not alone who have no interest in, but rather one always antagonizing our interests, successful too often in defeating our purposes through their influence exerted at the ballot over the unorganized, uneducated labor they employ. . . .
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Endorsed and referred to executive committee with instructions to forward the idea with all possible speed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The new federations==

In [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]] in 1898, the [[Western Federation of Miners]] and other labor organizations founded the [[Western Labor Union]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; and subsequently, in Chicago in 1905, members of the WFM participated in the founding of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]].

'''''Penny Arcade''''' is a [[webcomic]] focused on video games and [[video game culture]], written by [[Jerry Holkins]] and illustrated by [[Mike Krahulik]]. The comic debuted in 1998 on the website ''loonygames.com''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Check out our first original comic strip!| date= November 16–20, 1998 | publisher=loonyboi productions | url=http://www.loonygames.com/content/1.13/ | journal = loonygames | accessdate=July 26, 2009 | volume = 1 | issue = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Holkins and Krahulik have established their own site, which is typically updated with a new comic strip each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The comics are accompanied by regular updates on the site's blog.

''Penny Arcade'' is among the most popular and longest running webcomics currently online,&lt;ref name="1UP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&amp;cId=3145208 | title=Will Strip for Games | accessdate=December 13, 2006 | last=Maragos | first=Nich | date=November 7, 2005 | work=[[1UP.com]] | publisher=[[Ziff Davis Media|Ziff Davis]] | page=4 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628230730/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&amp;cId=3145208 | archivedate=June 28, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1972075_1972078_1972137,00.html | title = The 2010 TIME 100 Poll: The Penny Arcade Co-Creators | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = April 1, 2010 | accessdate =April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; listed in 2010 as having 3.5 million readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/2010-04-01-pennyarcade-creators01-ST_N.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|title='Penny Arcade' a testament to the power of gaming culture|author=Geddes, John|date=April 2, 2010|accessdate=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holkins and Krahulik are among the first webcomic creators successful enough to make a living from their work.&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;MacDonald, Heidi (December 19, 2005). "Web Comics: Page Clickers to Page Turners; It's like manga five or six years ago". ''Publishers Weekly'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the comic, Holkins and Krahulik also created [[Child's Play (charity)|Child's Play]], a children's charity; [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX]], a [[gaming convention]]; Penny Arcade TV, a [[YouTube]] channel;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTlOYZOU1HGEqgb2XetyBBQ|title=pennyarcadeTV|website=YouTube|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinny Arcade, a pin exchange; and the [[episodic video game]] ''[[Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness]]'' with [[Hothead Games]] and [[Zeboyd Games]].

==Overview==
[[Image:Krahulik Holkins, Comicon 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Mike Krahulik]] (left) and [[Jerry Holkins]] (right) at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] 2009.]]
The strip features Krahulik and Holkins' cartoon [[alter egos]], John "Gabe" Gabriel and Tycho Brahe, respectively. While often borrowing from the authors' experiences, Holkins and Krahulik do not treat them as literal [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]s or [[caricature]]s of themselves.&lt;ref name="Penny Arcade"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/2009/11/13/| title = Tycho/Jerry| accessdate =May 21, 2010| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = November 13, 2010| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two characters spend much of their time playing and commenting on computer and video games, which forms the basis of the humor in the strip. Most of the time Gabe serves the purpose of the comic and Tycho the [[comic foil]]. The strip can feature in-jokes that are explained in the news posts accompanying each comic, written by the authors.

Both Krahulik and Holkins make a living from ''Penny Arcade'', placing them in a small group of [[List of professional webcomic artists|professional webcomic artists]] devoted to their creations full-time. Originally, like many webcomics, ''Penny Arcade'' was supported solely by donations. A graph on the main page indicated how much people had donated that month. After hiring [[Robert Khoo]] as their business manager, Holkins and Krahulik switched to a different [[independent income|income stream]] based on advertising and [[Product (business)|merchandise]] revenue alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.foster.washington.edu/about/Pages/AlumniProfileRobertKhoo.aspx | title = Alumni Profile Robert Khoo | publisher = [[University of Washington Michael G. Foster School of Business|Foster School, University of Washington]] | accessdate =May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Holkins, the website in 2006 handled more than two million [[pageviews]] daily (excluding forum traffic).&lt;ref name="PA-blog 2006-03-13"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/2006/03/13| title = The Gambler, Part Three| accessdate =July 6, 2006| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = March 13, 2006| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 13, 2005, the website was given a facelift&lt;ref name="PA-blog 2005-11-14"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/2005/11/14| title = Seven Years!| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = November 14, 2005| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; in celebration of their seventh year running and to match the designs of the Child's Play Charity and [[Penny Arcade Expo]] websites. Afterwards, the site has been redesigned multiple times.

==Attributes of the comic strip==
As a (primarily) topical video gaming news comic, there is little [[plot (narrative)|plot]] or general [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in ''Penny Arcade'' strips. Any story sustained for longer than a single strip is referred to as "dreaded continuity", something of a [[running gag]] in the newsposts. A character who dies a violent death in one strip will come back in the next, perfectly whole, though occasionally these deaths have an effect on later comics. For example, often, when Gabe kills Tycho or vice versa, the killer takes a certain Pac-Man watch off the dead character, but only if he currently has the watch. [[Profanity]] and [[violence]] are common in ''Penny Arcade'' and the strip is known for its [[surrealism]]; [[zombie]]s, a talking alcoholic [[DIVX]] player called Div, [[Santa Claus]], a robotic juicer called the "Fruit Fucker 2000",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2001/07/11/ Diabolicious!] Penny Arcade, 2001-07-11&lt;/ref&gt; and Jesus, among others, are known to drop in often and for petty reasons. Other such occurrences are implied, if not shown, such as mentioning [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] from ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' living in the building next door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2001/10/19| title = An Honest Mistake| accessdate =July 6, 2006| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = October 19, 2001| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the comic does occasionally expand into more serious issues; one even had Krahulik, in the guise of the character Gabe, [[Marriage proposal|proposing]] to his [[girlfriend]] of two years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/1999/02/17| title = A VERY Special Penny Arcade!| accessdate =March 27, 2008| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = February 17, 1999| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another had both Gabe and Tycho praising Casey Heynes for standing up to bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Instruction| url = http://penny-arcade.com/comic/2011/03/18/instruction1|work=Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the strips are drawn from the perspective of fictional characters within a game or movie. Occasionally, Gabe and Tycho are featured as they would be as characters or players in the game themselves, often having some sarcastic remark to make about some feature or [[software bug|bug]] in the game. At times the comic also depicts meetings between game developers or business people, and features or mocks the reporters of a news article that is commented on in Holkins' newspost.

''Penny Arcade'' has a [[theme song]], "Penny Arcade Theme", written and performed by [[nerdcore hip hop|nerdcore]] artist [[MC Frontalot]]. It was written as a thank-you by Frontalot for the creators of the webcomic linking his website to their [[wikt:front page|front page]] and declaring him their "[[rapper]] [[laureate]]" in 2002. The song appears in the [[rhythm game|dance game]] ''[[In the Groove (video game)|In the Groove]]''.

===Jonathan "Gabe" Gabriel===
[[Mike Krahulik]]'s comic alter ego is energetic and free-spirited, but has a propensity to become extremely angry. He has a [[Pac-Man]] [[tattoo]] on his right arm,&lt;ref name="PA 1999-03-17"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/1999/03/17| title = pa one – from calvin klein| accessdate =November 25, 2008| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = March 17, 1999| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PA 1999-04-23"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/1999/04/23| title = Chicka-Wow Chicka-Wow Wow| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = April 23, 1999| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a tattoo in honor of the demise of [[SNK Playmore|SNK]] on his back.&lt;ref name="PA 2001-11-05"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2001/11/05| title = Much Love| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = November 5, 2001| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; His eyes are a shade of slate blue. He almost always wears a yellow [[Pac-Man]] shirt, and in one comic he mentioned having a glass eye as a result of an incident after Tycho beat him at ''[[Warcraft II]]'', although no other references to it have been made.&lt;ref name="PA 2002-07-10"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2002/07/10| title = Son Of True Story| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = July 10, 2002| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a fascination with [[unicorn]]s, a secret love of [[Barbie]]s, is a dedicated fan of [[Spider-Man]] and ''[[Star Wars]]'', and has proclaimed "[[Jessie's Girl]]" to be the greatest song of all time. He practices [[line dancing]] with the Kansas City Hotsteppers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/09/08| title = Undisclosed Propensities, Part I| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = September 8, 2004| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a [[diabetic]], though he continues to consume large quantities of sugar products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2003/04/07| title = Hello Panda| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = April 7, 2003| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has an odd affinity for a cardboard tube which he had fantasies of wielding as a wandering samurai, often in [[feudal Japan]].

===Tycho Brahe===
[[Jerry Holkins]]' comic [[alter ego]] (named after the [[astronomy|astronomer]] [[Tycho Brahe]]) is bitter and sarcastic. His eyes are [[burnt sienna]], and he's almost invariably clad in a blue-striped sweater. Tycho [[bibliophilia|enjoys books]], [[role-playing video game]]s, using large and uncommon words in conversation, and deflating Gabe's ego. He is a rabid fan of ''[[Harry Potter]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/11/16|title=Representing Hogwarts|accessdate=November 29, 2011| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = November 16, 2005| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Doctor Who]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penny-arcade.com/comic/2011/10/17|title=The Heresiarch|accessdate=November 29, 2011| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = October 17, 2011| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also plays ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' often (the website's previous banner illustrated him holding a [[Dice|20-sided die]]), and adopts a wildly theatrical style when acting as a dungeon master.

==Podcast==
Krahulik and Holkins began to record and release audio content on March 20, 2006, titled ''Downloadable Content.'' The [[podcast]]s specifically captured the creative process that goes into the creation of a ''Penny Arcade'' comic, usually starting with a perusal of recent gaming news, with conversational tangents and digressions to follow. As well as being a [[Making-of|behind-the-scenes]] look at the creation of ''Penny Arcade'', Krahulik and Holkins discuss possible subjects for the comic.

The format of the show was mostly "[[fly-on-the-wall]]" style, in that the hosts rarely acknowledged the existence of the microphone. There was no theme music, [[Introduction (music)|intro]], or [[Conclusion (music)|outro]]. The podcasts were of varying lengths, beginning abruptly and ending with the idea for the current comic. New episodes were released irregularly, with six month gaps not uncommon.

Although the shows were initially published weekly, Holkins stated in a May 2006 blog post that they have found difficulties when trying to produce the podcasts on a regular basis. The duo planned to keep recording podcasts occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/2006/05/03| title = A Failure to Plan| accessdate =August 26, 2007| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = May 3, 2006| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since airing the first episode of the new PATV in February 2010, the podcast has not been updated. A new segment has since appeared on PATV called "The Fourth Panel," which presents a fly-on-the-wall look at comics creation much as the podcast did.

On May 8, 2013 Penny Arcade launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to fund the continuation of ''Downloadable Content''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pennyarcade/penny-arcades-podcast-downloadable-content-the-ret| title = Penny Arcade's Podcast, "Downloadable Content": The Return| accessdate =May 9, 2013| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = May 8, 2013| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kickstarter was successful, with new Podcasts being added each Wednesday.

==Other works==

===Penny Arcade Presents===
[[Image:Pa presents.png|thumb|250px|Penny Arcade Presents]]Under the [[web banner|banner]] of "Penny Arcade Presents", Krahulik and Holkins are sometimes commissioned to create promotional artwork/comic strips for new video games, with their signature artistic style and humor. They are usually credited simply as "Penny Arcade" rather than by their actual names. Some of these works have been included with the distribution of the game, and others have appeared on pre-launch official websites. An official list can be found on the Penny Arcade website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.penny-arcade.com/presents|title=Penny Arcade - Presents|website=Penny Arcade|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collectible Card Game ===
On August 8, 2005, Krahulik announced that ''Penny Arcade'', in partnership with [[Sabertooth Games]], would be producing a [[collectible card game]] based on the ''Penny Arcade'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| publisher=Sabertooth Games | date = August 8, 2005 | title = Penny Arcade Press Release | url=http://www.sabertoothgames.com/stg/pa_press_release.asp | archive-url=https://archive.is/20060208135646/http://www.sabertoothgames.com/stg/pa_press_release.asp | dead-url=yes | archive-date=February 8, 2006 |accessdate =April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting ''Penny Arcade'' "battle box" was released in February 2006 as part of the [[Universal Fighting System]].

There are also a few [[Spin-off (media)|spinoffs]] from the main comic that have gained independent existences. An example is ''[[Epic Legends Of The Hierarchs: The Elemenstor Saga]]'' (ELotH:TES), a parody of the written-by-committee fantasy fiction used as back-story for a wide variety of games: originally a [[one-shot (comics)|one-off]] gag in the ''Penny Arcade'' comic, in late 2005 this was expanded into a complete fantasy universe, documented on a hoax "fan-wiki".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://elothtes.pbworks.com/ | work = ELotH:TES | title = FrontPage}}&lt;/ref&gt; ELotH:TES first appeared in the webcomic of February 7, 2005, and has subsequently been featured in the comics of November 7, 2005 and November 30, 2005. Several elements of the ELotH:TES universe are featured on the cover of their second comics collection, ''Epic Legends of the Magic Sword Kings''.

=== ESRB ad campaigns ===
On May 31, 2006 Krahulik announced a new [[advertising campaign]] for the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2006/06/01/pa-and-the-esrb| title = PA and the ESRB| accessdate =August 26, 2007| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = May 31, 2006| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Krahulik, the ESRB "wanted a campaign that would communicate to gamers why the ESRB is important even if they don't think it directly affects them." Among the reasons he listed for ''Penny Arcade''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s accepting the job was that he and Holkins are both fathers and are concerned about the games their children might play. The ad campaign was rolled out in the summer and fall of 2006 and a second campaign was released in 2012 featuring a mother, a father and a gamer describing the tools employed by the ESRB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esrb.org/about/psa.aspx|title=PSA ads for ESRB ratings education|website=www.esrb.org|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The New Kid" film===
Announced on June 2, 2011, [[Paramount Pictures]] had acquired the rights to produce an animated film, via [[Paramount Animation]] to make this, of the one-off strip ''The New Kid'' which was published on October 29, 2010. The strip was one of three mini-strips which featured a cinematic opening to a larger story left unexplored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5808076/one+off-penny-arcade-strip-gets-a-movie-deal|title=One-Off Penny Arcade Strip Gets a Movie Deal|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New Kid'' is about a boy who's moving to a new planet with his family because of his father's career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/10/29/|title=The New Kid|publisher=Penny Arcade|date=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was written by [[Gary Whitta]] and would have been produced by [[Mary Parent]] and Cale Boyter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/paramount-plots-next-animated-pic-194394|title=Paramount Plots Next Animated Pic with Alien Comic Adaptation 'New Kid' (Exclusive)|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 2, 2011|first=Borys|last=Kit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At PAX Australia in 2016, during a Q&amp;A session, Holkins revealed that changes at Paramount resulted in the movie rights being returned to Penny Arcade and the project canceled. He did note, however, that Whitta's script was complete and the project could move forward with another production company in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=pennyarcadeTV|title=The Wagers Of Sin - DLC Podcast Show, Season 7, Episode 19|date=2016-11-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8LcjISL4Ho&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=31m30s|accessdate=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Trenches===
'''''The Trenches''''' was a comic series by Krahulik and Holkins in collaboration with webcomic ''[[PvP]]'''s creator Scott Kurtz. The comic followed a man named Issac and his life as a game tester. The series was launched on August 9, 2011 and featured new strips every Tuesday and Thursday,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5829642/new-webcomic-to-out-the-horrors-of-game-testing|title=PvP and Penny Arcade Turn The Horrors of Game Testing Into Our Own Version of The Office|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|first=Brian|last=Crecente|date=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually accompanied by a "Tale from the Trenches", which was a short piece submitted by a reader detailing their own experiences in the game industry.

In September 2012, Kurtz stopped illustrating the webcomic, due to lack of time, and was replaced by Mary Cagle, a former intern of his, and the creator of the webcomic [[Kiwi Blitz]]. Kurtz still continued to collaborate with Krahulik and Holkins in writing the comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://penny-arcade.com/2012/10/26| title = Vomifuge| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = October 26, 2012| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late August 2013, illustration was taken over by Ty Halley (''Secret Life of a Journal Writer'') and Monica Ray (''Phuzzy Comics''), former contestants of the Penny Arcade series ''Strip Search''.

''The Trenches'' was ultimately abandoned. The last comic was posted January 5, 2016, while the last ''Tales'' is from September 10, 2015.

===The Decideotron===
Krahulik and Holkins have also released an application for [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] devices called ''The Decide-o-tron'', presented by Eedar and developed by The Binary Mill.&lt;ref name="Decide-o-tron LIVES"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penny-arcade.com/2011/08/22/decide-o-tron-lives|title=Decide-o-tron LIVES|publisher=penny-arcade.com|date=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.decideotron.com/|title=Decide-o-tron}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app works as a [[recommendation engine]] for video games; users input games they've enjoyed and the app attempts to predict their ratings of titles they haven't yet played.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5833386/penny-arcades-decide+o+tron-8000-knows-what-game-you-should-play-next|title=Penny Arcade’s Decide-o-Tron 8000 Knows What Game You Should Play Next|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|first=Mike|last=Fahey|date=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holkins described it as "[[Pandora Radio|Pandora]] for games".&lt;ref name="Decide-o-tron LIVES"/&gt;

===Kickstarter===
Penny Arcade has created two Kickstarter projects. The first was the ''Penny Arcade's Paint the Line'' card game which was used as an alternative to pre-ordering it and came with an exclusive comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/springboard/penny-arcades-paint-the-line-ecg-red-tide|title=Penny Arcade's Paint The Line ECG: Red Tide|publisher=[[Kickstarter]]|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/07/03/penny-arcades-paint-the-line-puts-a-new-spin-on-card-gaming/|title=Penny Arcade's 'Paint the Line' Puts a New Spin on Card Gaming|publisher=[[MTV#Internet|MTV.com]]|first=Matt|last=Morgan|date=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was entitled ''Penny Arcade Sells Out'' and was intended to replace advertising revenue with crowd funding. The leaderboard ad on the home page of Penny Arcade would be removed if the minimum goal of $250,000 were reached, whereas the entire site would become completely ad-free for a year at $999,999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575109064/penny-arcade-sells-out|title=Penny Arcade Sells Out |publisher=[[Kickstarter]]|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/07/10/penny-arcade-aims-to-go-ad-free-with-kickstarter-campaign-we-want-to-sell-out-to-you/|title=Penny Arcade aims to go ad-free with Kickstarter campaign: "We want to sell out to you"|publisher=[[PC Gamer]]|first=Tom|last=Senior|date=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reality web series described as "our version of America's Next Top Webcomic" titled ''[[Strip Search (web series)|Strip Search]]'' arose from the $450,000 stretch goal.

Krahulik and Holkins created a comic strip which compares the [[7th generation consoles]] that appears in the December 2006 issue of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Wired comparison"&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 2006|title=I Come in Peace, With Console Advice|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.12/play.html?pg=5|journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|volume=14|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Penny Arcade'' events==
{{Main|Child's Play (charity)|Penny Arcade Expo}}
Every Christmas since 2003, ''Penny Arcade'' hosts a charity called [[Child's Play (charity)|Child's Play]] to buy new toys for [[children's hospital]]s. They have also sponsored a three-day gaming festival called the [[Penny Arcade Expo]] every August since 2004.

==Legal issues and controversy==

===American Greetings===
[[Image:Tart as a double entendre.png|thumb|right|The Strawberry Shortcake parody]]Krahulik and Holkins received a [[cease and desist|cease-and-desist]] letter from [[American Greetings|American Greetings Corporation]] over the use of American Greetings' [[Strawberry Shortcake]] and [[Plum Puddin']] characters in the April 14, 2003 ''Penny Arcade'' strip entitled "[[Tart]] as a [[double entendre|Double Entendre]]". The strip was intended as a parody of the works of both [[American McGee]] (especially the computer game ''[[American McGee's Alice|Alice]]'') and [[McFarlane Toys]]. At the time, McFarlane toys and American McGee made separate toy lines, each portraying a dark, frightening interpretation of the characters and situations from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. Krahulik and Holkins' portrayal of Strawberry Shortcake parodied McFarlane Toys' depiction of [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] as [[Sadomasochism|bound and blindfolded]] by a pair of [[munchkin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1606 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040410235320/http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1606 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 10, 2004 |work=Spawn.com |title=Dorothy with Munchkins |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krahulik and Holkins chose not to enter into a legal battle over whether or not the strip was a protected form of [[parody]], and they complied with the [[cease-and-desist]] by replacing it with an image directing their audience to send a letter to a lawyer for American Greetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2003/04/14| title = Tart As A Double Entendre| accessdate =August 26, 2007| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = April 14, 2003| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later lampooned the incident by portraying an American Greetings employee as a [[Nazi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2003/04/28| title = Read It Before They Take Legal Action| accessdate =February 6, 2010| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = April 28, 2003| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 15, 2011, a strip entitled "Reprise" revisited the issue, due to the release of ''[[Alice: Madness Returns]]'', another American McGee game. In the strip, Gabe suggests that he and Tycho parody a brand not "under constant surveillance", resulting in a spoof of the ''[[Rainbow Brite]]'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2011/06/15/| title = Reprise| accessdate =June 17, 2011| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = June 15, 2011| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holkins stated in the accompanying news post that "it seemed like an incredible opportunity to relive the days of yore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/2011/6/15/| title = Reprise | accessdate =June 17, 2011| last = Holkins| first = Jerry| date = June 15, 2011| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jack Thompson===
On October 17, 2005 Krahulik and Holkins donated US$10,000 to the [[Entertainment Software Association]] foundation in the name of [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]], an activist against violence in video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Score, Avery | date=October 17, 2005 | title=Penny Arcade donates in Thompson's stead | work=[[GameSpot]] | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6135940.html |accessdate=April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, Thompson himself had promised to donate $10,000 if a video game was created in which the player kills video game developers (''[[A Modest Video Game Proposal]]''),&lt;ref name="GI.biz blasted"&gt;{{cite web | date=October 14, 2005 | title=Jack Thompson is blasted by pro-family group | work=[[GamesIndustry.biz]] | url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/jack-thompson-is-blasted-by-pro-family-group |accessdate=April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after a [[mod (computer gaming)|mod]] to the game ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' was pointed out to already exist, Thompson called his challenge [[satire]] (referring to the title of the letter as a reference to "[[A Modest Proposal]]") and refused to donate the money.&lt;ref name="10k promise"&gt;{{cite web | author=Gibson, Ellie | date=October 18, 2005 | title=Thompson refuses to keep 10k promise | work =[[GamesIndustry.biz]]|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/thompson-refuses-to-keep-10k-promise |accessdate=April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed these games were not going to be manufactured, distributed, or sold like retail games, as his Modest Proposal stated, and therefore, the deal went unfulfilled. His refusal was met with disdain, given that multiple games were created or in the process of being created under Thompson's criteria. Krahulik and Holkins donated the money in his place, with a check containing the memo: "For Jack Thompson, Because Jack Thompson Won't".

Thompson proceeded to phone Krahulik, as related by Holkins in the corresponding news post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/2005/10/14/and-all-of-it-true| title = And All Of It True| accessdate =August 26, 2007| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = October 14, 2005| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2005 it was reported that Jack Thompson had faxed a letter to Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske claiming that ''Penny Arcade'' "employs certain personnel who have decided to commence and orchestrate [[criminal harassment]] of me by various means".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/110152.html |title=Will Seattle's Finest Be Raiding Penny Arcade? |work=[[gamepolitics]] |date=October 18, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208023709/http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/110152.html |archivedate=February 8, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Sinclair | first1=Brendan | first2=Curt | last2=Brendan | date=October 18, 2005 | title=Thompson attacks Penny Arcade; seeks arrests | work=[[GameSpot]] | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6135979.html |accessdate=April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holkins defended the site by saying that the "harassment" Thompson referred to was simply "the natural result of a public figure making statements that people disagree with, and letting him know their thoughts on the matter via his publicly available contact information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/10/17/the-adventure-continues |title=The Adventure Continues |accessdate=July 26, 2009 |last1=Holkins |first1=Jerry |last2=Krahulik |first2=Mike |date=October 17, 2005 |work=Penny Arcade |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326141157/http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/10/17/the-adventure-continues |archivedate=March 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2005 Thompson claimed to have sent a letter to [[John McKay (attorney)|John McKay]], [[U.S. Attorney]] for the Western District of Washington, in an attempt to get the [[FBI]] involved. Thompson re-iterated his claims of "[[extortion]]" and accused ''Penny Arcade'' of using "their Internet site and various other means to encourage and solicit criminal harassment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/112527.html |work=[[gamepolitics]] |title=No End in Sight to Penny Arcade Saga; Thompson Turns to Feds |date=October 21, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060328075442/http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/112527.html |archivedate=March 28, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Penny Arcade denied the charge of "extortion", noting that they paid the $10,000 to charity, and asked nothing in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/2005/10/21/oh-nos-its-teh-feds| title = oh nos it's teh feds!| accessdate =August 26, 2007| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = October 21, 2005| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson claimed the harassment of him is a direct result of Mike Krahulik's posts, which listed links to the [[Florida Bar|Florida Bar Association]]. Thompson accused ''Penny Arcade'' of soliciting complaints to the Bar against him, even though Krahulik actually posted the opposite, asking fans to cease sending letters to the Bar, as the Bar acknowledged that it is aware of Thompson's actions, thanks to previous letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sinclair, Brendan |date=October 21, 2005 |title=Thompson goes federal with Penny Arcade feud |work=[[GameSpot]] |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6136318.html |accessdate=April 25, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625020247/https://www.gamespot.com/news/6136318.html |archivedate=June 25, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seattle PD eventually acknowledged receiving a complaint from Thompson, but have commented that they believe the issue to be a [[civil law (common law)|civil]], rather than [[criminal law|criminal]], matter. They noted that this was from initial impressions of the letter they received, and their criminal investigations bureau is reviewing the letter to make sure that there were not any criminal matters that they missed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sinclair, Brendan |date=October 27, 2005 |title=Seattle police pass on Penny Arcade flap |work=[[GameSpot]] |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6136737.html |accessdate=April 25, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216183639/https://www.gamespot.com/news/6136737.html |archivedate=February 16, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, [[Scott Kurtz]], creator of the webcomic ''[[PvP]]'' and a longtime friend of Krahulik and Holkins, used the image of the letter Thompson sent to the Seattle PD to create a parody letter in which Jack attempts to enlist the aid of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] by claiming Gabe and Tycho to be villains of some description.&lt;ref name="PvP letter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pvponline.com/images/news/letter.gif |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113230428/http://www.pvponline.com/images/news/letter.gif |archivedate=November 13, 2006 |title=Letter to the Justice League |accessdate=March 23, 2007 |last=Kurtz |first=Scott |authorlink=Scott Kurtz |date=October 18, 2005 |work=[[PvP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Penny Arcade'' shop had at the time sold an "I hate Jack Thompson" [[T-shirt]], claiming that every living creature, including Thompson's own mother, hates Jack Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Henriksen, Erik | date=October 27, 2005 | title=Game On | work=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] | url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/game-on/Content?oid=23829 |accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2007 Thompson filed a [[countersuit]] to the [[Take Two Interactive v. John B. Thompson|lawsuit brought against him]] by [[Take Two Interactive]] claiming that they are at the center of a [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]].

===Rape/dickwolves controversy===
An August 11, 2010 comic entitled "The Sixth Slave" wherein an [[Non-player character|NPC]] pleads with a player to save him from being raped nightly by monsters called "dickwolves",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sixth Slave|url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/08/11|work=Penny Arcade|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew criticism from many commentators, including from ''[[The American Prospect]]'' and ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]''. Krahulik and Holkins dismissed these criticisms, later selling "Team Dickwolves" T-shirts based on the strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Kennedy | first = Channing | title = How Does It Feel to Be a Problem on the Internet? | newspaper = The American Prospect | date =  February 4, 2011 | url = http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=02&amp;year=2011&amp;base_name=how_does_it_feel_to_be_a_probl | accessdate =February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Myers | first = Maddy | title = Penny Arcade surprised to find that rape jokes offend people | newspaper = The Boston Phoenix | date = August 16, 2010 | url = http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/laserorgy/archive/2010/08/16/penny-arcade-s-dubious-apology-for-dark-humor.aspx | accessdate =February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Myers | first = Maddy | title = Gaming, rape culture, and how I stopped reading Penny Arcade: When Dickwolves attack | newspaper = The Boston Phoenix | date = February 3, 2011 | url = http://thephoenix.com/Boston/life/116456-gaming-rape-culture-and-how-i-stopped-reading-pe/?page=1#TOPCONTENT | accessdate =March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later removed the "Team Dickwolves" shirt from their store due to complaints that it made potential PAX attendees uncomfortable. After the removal, Krahulik posted online that removing the shirts was only partly caving to pressure but mainly due to people who had personally emailed him and were reasonable with their concerns. Krahulik also stated that anyone still hesitant about going to PAX even after removal of the shirts should not come to PAX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/2011/1/28/dickwolves|title=Penny Arcade - News - Dickwolves|website=Penny Arcade|accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, on the last day of PAX, Krahulik told a panel that he thought that "pulling the dickwolves merchandise was a mistake", to cheers from the crowd.&lt;ref name=Statesman&gt;{{cite web|last=Hern|first=Alex|title=Penny Arcade reopens the "dickwolves" controversy|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/alex-hern/2013/09/penny-arcade-reopens-dickwolves-controversy|publisher=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Krahulik later apologized on the ''Penny Arcade'' website, stating that he regretted contributing to the furor that had followed the original comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/2013/09/04/some-clarification|title=Penny Arcade - News - Some Clarification|website=Penny Arcade|accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both critics of the comic strip and Krahulik and Holkins, made claims of receiving verbal abuse through social media and [[death threats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.com/2013/09/06/penny-arcade-controversy-will-not-die/|title=The Penny Arcade Controversy That Will Not Die|last=Fudge|first=James|work=[[GamePolitics.com]]|date=6 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910151034/http://gamepolitics.com/2013/09/06/penny-arcade-controversy-will-not-die |archivedate=September 10, 2013 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory"==
[[File:Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory.png|thumb|220px|Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory.]]
"John Gabriel's Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory" was posted in the ''Penny Arcade'' strip published March 19, 2004. It regards the [[online disinhibition effect]], in which Internet users exhibit unsociable tendencies while interacting with other Internet users. Krahulik and Holkins suggest that, given both [[anonymity]] and an audience, an otherwise regular person becomes aggressively antisocial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19| title = Green Blackboards (And Other Anomalies)| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = March 19, 2004| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Holkins gave the corollary that "Normal Person - ''Consequences'' + Audience = Total Fuckwad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2013/02/18/the-corollary| title = The Corollary| last1 = Holkins| first1 = Jerry| last2 = Krahulik| first2 = Mike| date = February 18, 2013| work = Penny Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clay Shirky]], an [[adjunct professor]] at [[New York University]] who studies social and economic effects of Internet technologies, explains: "There’s a large crowd and you can act out in front of it without paying any personal price to your reputation,” which "creates conditions most likely to draw out the typical Internet user’s worst impulses."&lt;ref name="advocate"/&gt; In an ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|Advocate]]'' article about online [[homophobia]], this theory was used to account for behavior on online forums where one can remain [[Anonymity|anonymous]] in front of an audience: for instance, posting comments on popular YouTube videos.&lt;ref name="advocate"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.advocate.com/article.aspx?id=22197 | issue = 1002 | title = Homophobosphere | journal = [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] | first = Will | last = Doig | date = February 26, 2008 | accessdate =January 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==

'''Richard Vigneault''' (born March 18, 1956) is a Canadian retired [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], [[Professional wrestling school|trainer]], and [[television presenter]], better known by his [[ring name]], '''Rick Martel'''. He is best known for his appearances with the [[American Wrestling Association]], the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and [[World Championship Wrestling]]. [[Championship (professional wrestling)|Championships]] held by Martel over the course of his career include the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]], [[WCW World Television Championship]], and [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]].

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1972–1980)===
Martel is from a family of wrestlers, and made his professional debut at age sixteen when his brother [[Michel Martel|Michel]], a wrestler, asked him to replace an injured wrestler. Martel was already a skilled [[Amateur wrestling|amateur wrestler]], and quickly adapted to professional wrestling.

Martel wrestled throughout the world, winning titles in Canada (in [[Stu Hart]]'s [[Stampede Wrestling]] and [[Vancouver]]-based [[NWA All Star Wrestling]]), [[New Zealand]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. His first real success in the [[United States]] came in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA)'s [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] affiliate, [[Pacific Northwest Wrestling]], where he became a top talent, holding the [[NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship (Vancouver version)|Canadian]] and [[NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship|PNW]] tag team titles simultaneously. He left PNW on August 16, 1980, when he lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match|Loser Leaves Town match]] to [[Buddy Rose]].  Martel also served a stint as a [[Booker (professional wrestling)|booker]] for a wrestling territory in Hawaii, where he would help the promotion set up matches and construct the storylines that would play out inside and outside of the ring.

===World Wrestling Federation (1980–1982)===
Martel debuted in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in July 1980. That fall, he formed a tag team with [[Tony Garea]]. On November 8, they defeated [[The Wild Samoans]] to capture the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name="Solietagtitles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/tthwwf.html|title=Solie's Title Histories: WWWF/WWF|accessdate=2011-09-02|publisher=Solie's Title Histories}}&lt;/ref&gt; They successfully defended the title until dropping the belts to [[The Moondogs (professional wrestling)|The Moondogs]] on March 17, 1981.&lt;ref name="Solietagtitles"/&gt; They regained the title from The Moondogs on July 21.&lt;ref name="Solietagtitles"/&gt; Their second reign came to an end on October 13, when they lost to [[Mr. Fuji]] and [[Masa Saito|Mr. Saito]].&lt;ref name="Solietagtitles"/&gt; Though they would challenge the champions numerous times, Martel and Garea were unable to recapture the belts, and Martel left the WWF in April 1982.

===American Wrestling Association (1982–1986)===
Martel signed with the AWA in 1982 and quickly ascended through the ranks, defeating [[Jumbo Tsuruta]] to win the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]] on May 13, 1984.&lt;ref name="SolieAWAtitle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/whtawa.html|title=Solie's Title Histories: AWA - American Wrestling Association|accessdate=2011-09-02|publisher=Solie's Title Histories}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reign as champion lasted nearly nineteen months (the third-longest title reign and the longest title reign of the 1980s), during which time he wrestled several matches with [[NWA World Champion]] [[Ric Flair]], as well as with [[Jimmy Garvin]], [[Nick Bockwinkel]] and [[Tonga Fifita|King Tonga]]. His [[Finisher (wrestling)|finishing move]] alternated between the slingshot splash and the combination atomic drop/back suplex.  On December 29, 1985, Martel lost the title to [[Stan Hansen]], who forced him to submit to the "Brazos Valley Backbreaker" (Hansen's version of the [[Boston crab]]).

===Return to WWF (1986–1995)===

====The Can-Am Connection (1986-1987)====
{{main article|The Can-Am Connection}}
In 1986, Martel returned to the WWF, with his [[tag team]] partner [[Tom Zenk]]. They were billed as [[The Can-Am Connection]]. The Can-Am Connection had been formed by Martel in the [[Montreal]]-based [[Lutte Internationale]] in 1986. Zenk was the boyfriend of Martel's sister-in-law, and had been introduced to Martel in the AWA by [[Curt Hennig]]. The Can-Am Connection with their youthful looks and high energy in-ring performances quickly garnered the affection of fans, and they looked likely to win the WWF Tag Team Title in the near future. At [[WrestleMania III]] in front of a reported 93,173 fans at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]], The Cam-Am connection defeated [[Bob Orton, Jr.|Ace Cowboy Bob Orton]] and [[Don Muraco|The Magnificent Muraco]] in the opening match, when Martel pinned Muraco with a flying cross-body helped by what commentator [[Gorilla Monsoon]] called "a schoolboy trip from behind" by Zenk. They split shortly afterward; Zenk claimed Martel had secretly negotiated an individual contract worth three times more than his partner's contract (traditionally, tag teams are paid roughly equal salaries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/9893/bttropes.htm |title=Interview with Tom Zenk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028153341/http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/9893/bttropes.htm |archivedate=October 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martel strongly disagreed. In ''Mad Dogs, Midgets and Screw Jobs'', he said: “Ever since I had been fired by Jim Barnett, I decided not to discuss money matters with other wrestlers . . . I did the same thing with Tom, and he put it in his head, or some other people put it in his head, that I made more than him. But as far as Vince was concerned,
if you were in a tag team, you earned the same amount of money.”&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|9781770410947}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed Zenk "...was overwhelmed by it all... Wrestling is very hard on your body. Hard on you also mentally. It's hard physically. Tom wasn't mentally or physically hard as I thought he would be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestling/martel_interview2.html | title=Interview with Rick Martel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strike Force (1987–1989)====
{{main article|Strike Force (professional wrestling)}}
At the time of Zenk's departure, The Can-Am Connection was in a feud with [[The Islanders (professional wrestling)|The Islanders]] ([[Tonga Fifita|Haku]] and [[Sam Fatu|Tama]]); Zenk's departure was worked into the feud, with the Islanders claiming that Zenk was a quitter and abandoned Martel because he knew they could never beat them. In July 1987, Martel defeated both Haku and Tama in singles competition. Then on the August 15, 1987 episode of  ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]'' after Martel defeated [[Barry Horowitz]], he was jumped by The Islanders. [[Tito Santana]], who was doing commentary in the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] broadcast booth, ran to the ring to help Martel fight off his attackers. Martel and Santana then formed a tag team called [[Strike Force (professional wrestling)|Strike Force]]. The team were played off as good looking pretty boys (a storyline that came directly from the Can-Am Connection), even using the theme called "Girls In Cars", which was originally made for the Can-Am Connection. The name Strike Force came from Santana's promise that as a team they would, "be striking (The Islanders) with force." Martel immediately came up with the team's name based on this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78ESBx2Ryzw|title=Strike Force is born!|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning their feud with The Islanders, Strike Force immediately challenged [[The Hart Foundation]] ([[Bret Hart|Bret "Hitman" Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart|Jim "The Anvil" Neidhart]]) for the WWF World Tag Team Title. Strike Force won the titles on an episode of ''Superstars'' after Martel made Neidhart submit to a [[Boston crab]]. Strike Force would hold the titles for five months, defending primarily against the Hart Foundation and the Islanders, before losing to [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] ([[Bill Eadie|Ax]] and [[Barry Darsow|Smash]]) at [[WrestleMania IV]] in [[Atlantic City]] when Smash pinned Martel as a result of Martel being hit on the back of the neck by Ax using [[Mr. Fuji]]'s cane as a weapon when Martel had Smash in the Boston crab and the referee was distracted by Santana beating up Mr. Fuji on the ring apron.&lt;ref name="Solietagtitles"/&gt;

Shortly afterward, Martel ([[kayfabe]]) took time off due to injuries sustained in a title rematch against Demolition at a ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling|Prime Time Wrestling]]'' taping in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]] on June 1, 1988 (aired July 11). Smash hit Martel with a steel chair, then Demolition performed their "Demolition Decapitation" finisher on him at ringside, leaving him unconscious on the floor. On the June 18 ''Superstars'', it was announced he suffered back injuries and a concussion. In the storyline, he briefly retired due to these injuries. In reality, he was granted leave from the WWF and took six months off to help care for his severely ill wife.&lt;ref&gt;Santana, Tito (2008).''Tito Santana's Tales From The Ring'', pp.81-82, Sports Publishing LLC.  {{ISBN|978-1-59670-325-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rick Martel, Shoot Interview by RF video&lt;/ref&gt;

Martel returned in January 1989 as a singles wrestler, before reforming Strike Force with Santana at [[WrestleMania V]] to face The [[Brain Busters]] ([[Arn Anderson]] and [[Tully Blanchard]]). During the match, Santana accidentally hit Martel with his signature [[Professional wrestling attacks#Flying forearm smash|flying forearm smash]] and knocked him out of the ring. A frustrated Martel refused to tag in and walked away, leaving Santana to be beaten down and pinned.&lt;ref name="WM5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/5/results|title=WrestleMania V results|accessdate=2011-09-02|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the match in an interview with [[Gene Okerlund|"Mean" Gene Okerlund]] who asked him how he could leave his partner "high and dry" and said that Strike Force was "supposed to be a team, a team", an irate Martel said, "I'm sick and tired. I'm sick and tired of him. You know, I was doing great as a singles wrestler, but no, Mr. Tito wants to ride my coattails some more. You saw his timing was off". Then angrily addressing Santana he said "You're lucky that being the gentleman that I am that I just walked off. That could have been a lot worse for you Tito Santana."

Following his [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|turn]], Martel acquired [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]] as his manager. He [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with Santana on and off over the next two years, losing to him in the finals of the [[King of the Ring#1989|1989 King of the Ring]] tournament, then defeating him at [[WWF The Main Event#The Main Event IV|The Main Event IV]] taping on October 30, 1990 (aired November 23).&lt;ref name="OWOWKOTR89"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/kingofthering89/|title=King of the Ring 1989 results|accessdate=2011-09-02|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OWOWMainEventIV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/snme/901030.html|title=The Main Event IV results|accessdate=2011-09-02|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As 1989 came to a close, Martel's relationship with Slick quietly ended.

====The Model (1989–1995)====
In late 1989, Martel adopted a [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] gimmick, as "The Model". Just before the [[1989 Survivor Series]] (where in a continuation of their feud, Martel pinned Santana in the opening elimination match of the night), he introduced his own (fictional) brand of [[perfume|cologne]] called ''Arrogance'', which he carried in a large [[Atomizer nozzle|atomizer]] and sprayed in the eyes of his opponents to blind them. He wore a turquoise sweater tied around his neck to the ring (later replaced by a turquoise sportcoat), with a large [[lapel pin]] that read "Yes, I am a model."&lt;ref name=WrestleCrap&gt;{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|page=70|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-1-55022-584-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martel made his pay-per-view singles match debut at [[WrestleMania VI]] at the [[Skydome]] in [[Toronto]], where he defeated [[Koko B. Ware]] via submission with his signature Boston Crab.&lt;ref name="WM6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/6/results|title=WrestleMania VI results|accessdate=2013-03-27|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martel's most high-profile feud during his stint as "The Model" was with [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]], sparked when he blinded Roberts with ''Arrogance'' on "[[Bruce Prichard#Brother Love Show|The Brother Love Show]]" in October 1990. Martel and Roberts captained opposing teams at the [[Survivor Series (1990)|Survivor Series]]. "The Visionaries" (Martel, [[The Warlord (wrestler)|The Warlord]] and [[Power and Glory]]) defeated The Vipers (Roberts, [[Superfly Jimmy Snuka]] and [[The Rockers]]) in a 4-0 clean sweep, the first time this had happened in [[Survivor Series]] history. In the 1990 Survivor Series (unlike previous editions), the heel survivors faced off against the babyface survivors in a grand final "Match Of Survival". There "The Visionaries" teamed with [[Ted DiBiase|"The Million Dollar Man" Ted Dibiase]] to face Tito Santana, [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[WWF World Heavyweight Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] [[The Ultimate Warrior]]. Martel was eliminated from the match after he got himself counted out by abandoning his team after receiving beatings from both Hogan and The Warrior.&lt;ref name="SSeries1990"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1990/results|title=Survivor Series 1990 results|accessdate=2011-09-02|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martel continued to have the upper hand in the [[Royal Rumble (1991)|1991 Royal Rumble]] match, eliminating Roberts from the match en route to lasting (a then-record) 53 minutes, before being eliminated by [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://slashwrestling.com/guests/cfgb53.html | title=Guest Columns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts would ultimately get his revenge at [[WrestleMania VII]], defeating Martel in a blindfold match. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the blindfold match in which both wrestlers wore black hoods and could not see (though Roberts later admitted that they did have limited vision due to the lighting), it was rated as one of the poorer [[Wrestlemania]] matches.&lt;ref name="WM7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/7/results|title=WrestleMania VII results|accessdate=2011-09-02|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of 1991, Martel represented the WWF on Japanese tours for [[Super World Sports]]. In December 1991, he lost to [[Naoki Sano]] in a match to determine the inaugural SWS Junior Heavyweight Champion.

In early 1992, Martel began a feud with [[Chris Chavis|Tatanka]], leading to [[WrestleMania VIII]], where Tatanka pinned him.&lt;ref name="WM8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/8/results|title=WrestleMania VIII results|accessdate=2011-09-02|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer, Martel had a brief feud with [[Shawn Michaels]], as both men sought the affections of [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Sherri]]. The feud ended with a chain of events that resulted in a double [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] at [[SummerSlam (1992)|SummerSlam 1992]] held at the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in [[London]], [[England]] in front of what remains the [[SummerSlam]] record attendance of 80,355. The match carried a "no punching in the face" stipulation, mutually agreed upon and eventually disregarded by the two narcissistic heels.&lt;ref name="SummerSlam1992"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/1992/results|title=SummerSlam 1992 results|accessdate=2011-09-02|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martel then resumed his rivalry with Tatanka by stealing his sacred eagle feathers, to add to his wardrobe. The feud was resolved at the [[Survivor Series (1992)|1992 Survivor Series]], where Tatanka again defeated Martel and reclaimed the feathers.&lt;ref name="SSeries1992"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1992/results|title=Survivor Series 1992 results|accessdate=2011-09-02|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1993, Martel mainly appeared on the [[Card (sports)|lower undercard]], and rarely on television, mostly on programs such as ''All-American Wrestling'' and ''Wrestling Challenge''. However, at the September 27 ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' taping, he was the co-winner (with [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Razor Ramon]]) of a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] (aired October 4) to decide the competitors in a match for the vacant [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]]. He lost that match (aired the next week) to Ramon.&lt;ref name="ICtitle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322472|title=WWE Intercontinental Title History - Razor Ramon's first reign|accessdate=2011-09-02|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Martel began moving slightly up the card once again. Martel also briefly feuded with [[Bastion Booger]], losing one of their matches when he got fed up with how Booger smelled and started spraying him with his ''Arrogance'' cologne. Martel also appeared at ''[[Survivor Series 1993]]'' in a 4-4 elimination match, being eliminated by [[The 1-2-3 Kid]] and in the ''[[Royal Rumble 1994|1994 Royal Rumble]]'' as the 26th entrant before getting eliminated by his old rival Tatanka. Martel was set to appear in a ten-man tag team match at ''[[Wrestlemania X]]'' but the match was cancelled during the show due to the show running out of time. The match was later held on ''RAW'', with Martel's team victorious.

By the summer of 1994, Martel dropped out of the WWF picture and would not be seen again until participating in the [[Royal Rumble (1995)|1995 Royal Rumble]] (he was a substitute for [[Jim Neidhart]]).&lt;ref name="OWOWRR95"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/royalrumble95/|title=Royal Rumble 1995 results|accessdate=2011-09-02|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813103259/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/royalrumble95/|archivedate=2011-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martel's final appearance came the following month at a house show in Montreal, as his wrestling career began to slow as Martel pursued a career in [[real estate]].

In a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] interview with RF video, Martel claimed that he and [[Don Callis]] were set to return to the WWF as 'The Supermodels' in 1997, before Callis turned on Martel, turning him face for the first time since 1989. However, after a pay dispute with WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]], Martel signed with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW). Callis confirmed that he and Martel were set to debut as a team during an interview with WWE.com in 2015.

===World Championship Wrestling (1997–1998)===
Martel debuted for WCW in 1997, feuding with [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] for the [[WCW World Television Championship|World Television Championship]] and winning it on the February 16, 1998 ''[[WCW Nitro|Nitro]]''. Martel's comeback was cut short during his rematch with Booker T at [[SuperBrawl VIII]] on February 22, when he landed badly on a throw, hitting his leg on one of the [[Wire rope|ring ropes]]. He tore an inside [[ligament]] of his right knee, fractured his leg and suffered [[cartilage]] damage, effectively ending his in-ring career. He was originally booked to retain the Television Title in the match, intended to be a [[gauntlet match]], by beating Booker and then [[Perry Saturn]]. Martel and Booker worked out a finish in the ring (by which Martel suffered a further injury after a [[Botch (professional wrestling)|botched]] Harlem Sidekick), and then Booker and Saturn worked the second half of the match entirely on the fly. Martel was out of action for several months.

After suffering another injury in his first match back (on the July 13 episode of ''Nitro'', against Booker T's [[Harlem Heat]] tag team partner (and real life older brother), [[Stevie Ray]]), Martel retired from the ring.&lt;ref name=CatchingUp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wherearetheynow/rickmartel |title=Catching up with Rick Martel |last=DiFino |first=Lennie |accessdate=2010-07-17 |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |date=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement (1998–present)===
After retiring from the ring, Martel worked for WCW as a trainer, and as host of the [[French language|French]] versions of WCW programming.

After the main event of a [[house show]] in [[Quebec City]] on May 3, 2003, then WWE Champion [[Brock Lesnar]] introduced Martel to the ring as a surprise, and shook his hand. Martel, who received a standing ovation from his home fans, said he was honoured to be associated with WWE and thanked the fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_3633.shtml | title=5/3 WWE in Quebec City: Brock vs. Cena, Show vs. Benoit| first=Christian | last=Berube | publisher=PWTorch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At WWE's [[Vengeance: Night of Champions]] pay-per-view in 2007, Martel, along with his former teammate Tony Garea, saved [[Jimmy Snuka]] and [[Sgt. Slaughter]] from a post-match attack at the hands of [[Deuce 'n Domino]].&lt;ref name=CatchingUp/&gt;

Martel is a playable character in ''[[WWE 2K18]]'' and ''[[WWE 2K19]]'', the first video game appearance since 1993's Sega Mega drive/Genesis version of ''[[WWF Royal Rumble (1993 video game)|WWF Royal Rumble]]''.

The '''Scottish History Society''' is a [[text publication society]] founded in 1886, as part of the late 19th-century revival in interest in [[Scottish national identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishhistorysociety.org/departments/scottishhistorysociety/history/|title=The Scottish History Society — History|publisher=The Scottish History Society, School of History, University of St Andrews|accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society was founded as a result of a letter from the [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]] (later to serve as Prime Minister, from 1894–95), published in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' on 3 February 1886,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickson|first=W. K.|authorlink=William Kirk Dickson|title=Scottish History Society: Fifty years, 1886-1936|url=http://www.scottishhistorysociety.org/media/media_93693_en.pdf|year=1936|publisher=Scottish History Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rosebery became the first President of the Society.

The first president of the Society defined its work as "the humble and unobtrusive task of letting everyman know, in so far as in us lies, and so far as documentary evidence exists, how our forebears lived and worked and carried on the business of their country in their separate spheres."{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The Society has a council of scholars representing most of the universities in Scotland and some beyond, as well as other institutions.

==History of the society==
The Scottish History Society was founded with the object of discovery and publication, under selected editorship, of unpublished documents illustrative of the civil, religious, and social history of Scotland.

The first publications, in October 1887, were ''Bishop Pococke's Tours in Scotland, 1747-1760'', edited by D W Kemp, and the ''Diary of and General Expenditure Book of William Cunningham of Craigends, 1673–1680'', edited by the Reverend James Dodds, D.D.

By 1900, 65 Public Libraries subscribed for the society's publications. Amongst some of its notable members have been Sir [[James Balfour Paul]], [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], and Emeritus Professor [[David Masson]], [[Historiographer Royal (Scotland)|Historiographer Royal for Scotland]].

Since its foundation the SHS has produced an increasing number of vital records hitherto unavailable to scholars of Scottish history, and in this the SHS have provided an invaluable service to the nation.

==President of the society==
In 1900, the President was the [[Earl of Rosebery]]. In 1970, the President was Professor [[Gordon Donaldson]]. Other Presidents have included the novelist and politician [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir]] and Dr [[Jenny Wormald]]. The current president is Professor Roger Mason of the University of St Andrews.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2687">The '''Shell Canada Lawsuit''' was a [[class action]] suit filed against [[Shell Canada|Shell Canada Limited]] on July 18, 2003, on behalf of customers who purchased "Bronze" ([[Octane rating|regular-grade]]) [[gasoline]] products, to which Shell Canada added an "[[Gasoline additive|additive]]", between March 1, 2001 and April 15, 2002. This additive allegedly caused damage to the [[fuel supply system]] of many cars, most commonly of [[Acura]], [[Chrysler]], [[Dodge]], [[Ford]], [[General Motors]], [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]] and [[Volvo]] brands. While Shell Canada estimated that between 100,000 and 200,000 customers bought "Bronze" products during that period, it is unknown how many total vehicles were affected.

A settlement was reached on January 7, 2004, and was approved by the [[Superior Court of Quebec]] in June 2004. Under the settlement, Shell compensated people who owned or leased vehicles that were filled with at least [[Canadian dollar|C$]]100 worth of Shell branded gasoline between March 1, 2001 and April 15, 2002 and that experienced [[fuel pump]] or [[fuel sensor]] problems before July 31, 2002. Claims were able to be made under the class action until November 5, 2004.

There are three classes of claims and compensation:
*People who owned or [[lease]]d 1996&amp;ndash;2002 Chrysler vehicles (except [[Jeep]]s) were fully reimbursed for fuel pump and fuel sensor repairs and for eligible [[out-of-pocket expenses]]. 
*People who owned or leased other 1996&amp;ndash;2002 vehicles and who can establish that the fuel pump or fuel-sending unit had a particular residue on it were reimbursed for eligible repairs and out-of-pocket costs to a maximum of C$175. 
*People who owned or leased pre-1996 vehicles and who can establish that the fuel pump or fuel-sending unit had a particular residue on it were reimbursed for eligible repairs and out-of-pocket expenses to a maximum of C$100.

'''Smithsonian Libraries''' (SIL), formerly known as '''Smithsonian Institution Libraries''', is a library system comprising 20 branch libraries serving the various [[Smithsonian Institution]] museums and [[research centers]], as well as central support services which include a Book Conservation Laboratory and an Imaging Center.  The Libraries serve Smithsonian Institution staff as well as the scholarly community and [[general public]] with information and reference support. Its collections number over 1.5 million volumes including 40,000 rare books and 2,000 manuscripts. The Libraries also holds the [[United States]]' largest trade literature collection, which includes over 300,000 commercial catalogs dating from the early nineteenth century and representing more than 30,000 companies.&lt;ref name=History /&gt;&lt;ref name=dLib&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january06/01featured-collection.html |last=Kalfatovic|first=Martin|title=Galaxy of Knowledge: Art &amp; Design|journal=D-Lib Magazine|date=January 2006|volume=12|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Libraries' collections focus primarily on science, art, history and culture, and [[museology]].&lt;ref name=FactSheet&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet for the Smithsonian Institution Libraries|url=http://www.sil.si.edu/Press/PDF/SILFactSheet.pdf|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   SIL is continuously analyzing its mission and goals in order to best meet the information and knowledge needs of new generations of users, to strengthen research, and to reach through cyberspace those unable to visit the Smithsonian museums and research centers in person.&lt;ref name="strat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smithsonianlibraries.si.edu/smithsonianlibraries/2009/03/strategic-planning.html |title=Smithsonian Libraries: Strategic planning |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Libraries |date= |accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, SIL celebrated its 40th anniversary. Nancy E. Gwinn, Ph.D., was named director in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.si.edu/staff/nancy-gwinn|title=Nancy E.

==Mission==

{{Quotation|As the largest and most diverse museum library in the world, SIL leads the Smithsonian in taking advantage of the opportunities of the digital society. SIL provides authoritative information and creates innovative services and programs for Smithsonian Institution researchers, scholars and curators, as well as the general public, to further their quest for knowledge. Through paper preservation and digital technologies, SIL ensures broad and enduring access to the Libraries’ collections for all users.&lt;ref name=strategicplan&gt;{{cite web|title=A Focus on Service: Strategic Plan 2009-2013
|url=http://www.sil.si.edu/PDF/Focus_on_Service.pdf|publisher=Smtihsonian Institution Libraries|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==History==

The original library was founded by an [[Act of Congress]] on August 10, 1846, when the Smithsonian Institution was named a trust instrumentality of the United States.  The Act created a Board of Regents for the Institution, and called for a building to house a museum with geological and mineralogical cabinets, a chemical laboratory, a gallery of art, lecture rooms, and a library.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Smithsonian Libraries|url=http://www.sil.si.edu/Galaxy.cfm?id=2.223|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smithsonian Libraries system as it exists today was not established until 1968, when Secretary [[S. Dillon Ripley]] realized that the existing library organization was greatly in need of an overhaul. He created a new position, Director of the Smithsonian Institution Libraries, and hired [[Russell Shank]] to fill the role.&lt;ref name=History /&gt; Shank reorganized the library staff and procedures, and created a modern, unified system with central services and a union catalog.  By 1977, when Shank left, the quality and research value of the scientific collections were recognized nationally, and SIL was invited to join the [[Association of Research Libraries]]. SIL was granted a seat on the executive board of the Federal Libraries and Information Centers Coordinating Committee.&lt;ref name=History /&gt; 

The late 1970s and 1980s also saw a growth in the number of Smithsonian Libraries branches, brought about by a range of donations to the Institution. In 1976, ten thousand rare scientific books and manuscripts were gifted to the Smithsonian by the [[Burndy Library]], prompting the creation of the Dibner Library of the History of Science and Technology under the Smithsonian umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.si.edu/about/history |title=History of the Libraries |last=Gwinn |first=Nancy E. |date=2007 |website=Smithsonian Libraries |access-date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later, large donations of artifact collections led to the formation of new museums for subjects such as [[African art]], [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] culture and [[postal history]] and a new library branch was subsequently formed for each of these as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.si.edu/about/history |title=History of the Libraries |last=Gwinn |first=Nancy E. |date=2007 |website=Smithsonian Libraries |access-date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s introduced an expansion of the Libraries' focus to improve their ability to reach and educate the general public. The introduction of electronic and Internet technology played a large role in spurring this new outreach endeavor. In 1999, under the leadership of director Robert Maloy, Smithsonian Libraries staff completed a fourteen-year long effort to create a public access online catalog, with 97 percent of their then-holdings gaining digital records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.si.edu/about/history |title=History of the Libraries |last=Gwinn |first=Nancy E. |date=2007 |website=Smithsonian Libraries |access-date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, the Smithsonian Institution Libraries formally changed its name to Smithsonian Libraries "to simplify and strengthen the Libraries as part of an overall rebranding in the modern era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://library.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/general_pages/silnamechangerelease_4.pdf|date=March 21, 2013|title=New Name for Smithsonian Institution Libraries|publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Purpose''' ''This site seeks to promote deeper standardization within the oil and energy industry by highlighting areas where standardization has worked very well and where it has not and why, and provoking discussions on the path forward for better standardization.''

The overall purpose of the document is to issue a guideline on the application of IEC 61508 and IEC 61511 in the Norwegian Petroleum Industry, and thereby simplify the use of the standards.

According to the PSA management regulations (§1 and §2), performance requirements shall be established for all safety barriers on an installation. For instrumented safety systems, special reference is made to IEC 61508 and this document as the recommended standard for specification, design and operation of such safety systems.

Whereas IEC 61508 describes a fully risk based approach for determining SIL (Safety Integrity Level) requirements, this document provides minimum SIL requirements for the most common instrumented safety functions on a petroleum production installation (ref. chapter 7). Deviations from these requirements may however be identified
(ref. section 7.7), and in such case the overall methodology and documentation should be in accordance with IEC 61508.

==Conventional Industry practice==
There are still many standards in use within the industry.  Shell for example use the IPF method, BP has its own. These standards could be supplements to areas lacking within the standards. Experience shows that the majors tend to go against standards but non adoption of standards tend to lead to unclarity of intention, mistaken interpretations which then leads to  costs creep, gold plating and scope.

==Costs and Benefits==
* Standardized Industrial design
* Consistent approach.
* Suppliers know what they deliver
* Easier to insure.


==CASE 1: OLF 70 - Effectiveness through standardisation==
'''OLF 70''' is one of several joint industry project between oil industry operators and the various suppliers of services and equipment in the industry.

'''OLF''', the [[Norwegian Oil Industry Association]], is a professional body and employer's association for oil and supplier companies (engaged in the field of exploration and production of oil and gas) on the [[Norwegian continental shelf]]. OLF is a member of the Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry.  OLF participates in the petroleum industry, as an advocate in matters that concern the entire sector.

==CASE 2:Professional Petroleum Data Management Association (PPDM)==

The PPDM Association is a global, not-for-profit organization that develops data management standards for the petroleum industry. See [[Professional Petroleum Data Management Association]]

A '''term sheet''' is a [[bullet-point]] document outlining the material terms and conditions of a business agreement.  After a term sheet has been "executed", it guides legal counsel in the preparation of a proposed "final agreement".  It then guides, but is not necessarily binding, as the signatories negotiate, usually with legal counsel, the final terms of their agreement.

A term sheet implies the conditions of a business transaction, as proposed by a party. It may be either binding or non-binding.

Term sheets are very similar to "[[letter of intent|letters of intent]]" (LOI) in that they are both preliminary, mostly [[non-binding]] documents meant to record two or more parties' intentions to enter into a future agreement based on specified (but incomplete or preliminary) terms.  The difference between the two is slight and mostly a matter of style: an LOI is typically written in letter form and focuses on the parties' intentions; a term sheet skips most of the formalities and lists deal terms in bullet-point or similar format.  There is an implication that an LOI only refers to the final form.  A term sheet may be a proposal, not an agreed-to document.

Within the context of [[venture capital financing]], a term sheet typically includes conditions for financing a [[startup company]]. The key offering terms in such a term sheet include (a) amount raised, (b) price per share, (c) pre-money valuation, (d) liquidation preference, (e) voting rights, (f) anti-dilution provisions, and (g) registration rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nvca.org/download/5091/|title=Example Term Sheet|website=National Venture Capital Association|date=June 2013|access-date=October 1, 2018|format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is customary to begin the negotiation of a venture investment with the circulation of a term sheet, which is a summary of the terms the proposer (the issuer, the investor, or an intermediary) is prepared to accept. The term sheet is analogous to a letter of intent, a nonbinding outline of the principal points which the stock purchase agreement and related agreements will cover in detail.

The advantage of the abbreviated term sheet format is, first, that it expedites the process.  Experienced counsel immediately know generally what is meant when the term sheet specifies "one demand registration at the issuer's expense, unlimited piggybacks at the issuer's expense, weighted average antidilution"; it saves time not to have to spell out the long-form edition of those references. Second, since the term sheet does not propose to be an agreement of any sort, it is less likely that a court will find unexpected promissory content; a "letter of intent" can be a dangerous document unless it specifies very clearly, as it should, which portions are meant to be binding and which merely guide the discussion and drafting. Some portions of a term sheet can have binding effect, of course, if and to the extent an interlocutory memorialization is needed of some binding promises, that is, confidentiality of the disclosures made in the negotiation. The summary format of a term sheet, however, makes it less likely that any party will be misled into thinking that some form of enforceable agreement has been memorialized when it has not.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph W. Bartlett, [https://web.archive.org/web/20111120204413/http://vcexperts.com/encyclopedia/chapters/3370 "Background Negotiation of a Venture Investment"]. VCExperts.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important terms to founders and venture capitalists: 
* Return - Valuation/ Dilution: One of the most important terms for founders is valuation; whether the evaluation is high or not determines tells the entrepreneurs whether or not the investor is credible. Also, option pools are part of the evaluation and usually founders have the power to negotiate option pool, they shouldn’t get greedy and should present a strong case.   This term is important since option pool can lower the effective valuation.
* Control - [[Board of Directors|BOD]]: A very common and usual arrangement is a board of three directors, one from investor and two from founders (for motivational purposes).
* Liquidation Preferences: This represents how much the founders will receive in an event of company sale etc. Thus it is very important as the ultimate goal is to make returns. Terms represented by CRV seem normal and acceptable.
* Founder vesting: This plays a major role in motivating the founders 
* Voting rights: Voting rights are very important to the investor in this case for them to demand rights of whether to accept or reject actions taken by the founders such as sale, additional financing and other matters that should be approved by a certain percentage of Series A Preferred stockholders (the VC). 
* Co-Sale Terms: If one of the common shareholders were to sell his/her shares, partially or completely, they should include the investors, or drag them along with the sale and sell part of theirs. This is very crucial to the investor.

'''''The Oxford Companion to Music''''' is a music reference book in the [[Book series|series]] of [[Oxford Companions]] produced by the [[Oxford University Press]]. It was originally conceived and written  by [[Percy Scholes]] and published in 1938. Since then, it has undergone two distinct rewritings: one by [[Denis Arnold]], in 1983, and the latest edition by Alison Latham in 2002.  It is "arguably the most successful book on music ever produced" (Wright, p.&amp;nbsp;99).

==Single-volume edition by Percy Scholes==
The first edition, a single-volume work, was produced in 1938, edited by Percy Scholes, and was written almost entirely by him alone.

The second edition, published 1939 includes a 64-page categorised ''List of books about music in the English language'' by Scholes.

Wherever possible, Scholes tried to use primary source material, rather than summarizing other people's work. His preface to the First Edition describes how he played and read through thousands of sheets of music, as well as reading thousands of concert programs and studying "old literature and long-bygone musical journals". From this research, he produced about fifty-five volumes of notes. Each of these was devoted to a separate branch of musical knowledge. He then sought peer review of each of these volumes with specialists in the particular branch of musical knowledge. Finally, these volumes were broken up and re-constituted in alphabetical order.

Scholes' intention was to produce a work relevant to a wide range of readers, from the professional musician to the concert-goer, "gramaphonist", or radio-listener. His work was aimed at a reader for whom it "will neither be beyond the scope of his pocket nor embarrass him by a manner of expression so technical as to add new puzzles to the puzzle which sent him to the book". The result was a work which was highly accessible to the general reader, as well as being useful for the specialist.

While scholarly and well-researched, Scholes' style was also sometimes quirky and opinionated. For instance, his original articles on some of the twentieth-century composers were highly dismissive, as were his articles on genres such as jazz. His entry on the [[can-can]] concluded "Its exact nature is unknown to anyone connected with this Companion."

He produced several revisions prior to his death (in 1958), with the last full revision being the 9th edition in 1955. The Tenth Edition, published in 1970, was a revision of Scholes' work by [[John Owen Ward]]. Ward considered it "inappropriate to change radically the characteristic rich anecdotal quality of Dr. Scholes' style."  Although he brought some of the articles up to date, he left much of Scholes' distinctive work intact.

A distinctive feature of this Companion is a series of "imaginative" portraits of composers created by the artist [[Oswald Barrett]] (known as "Batt"). These consist of engravings (Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Byrd, Chopin, Elgar, Handel, Haydn, Liszt, Mozart, Schubert, Schumann, Tchaikovsky, and Wagner)&lt;ref&gt;A selection of Batt's composer portraits appear in a [https://www.flickr.com/photos/126022159@N06/sets/72157651624908812 Flickr photoset] (accessed: 12 May 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;, and a frontispiece which is a colour reproduction of an oil painting of "Beethoven in Middle Life", described by Scholes as "the artist's personal gift to the volume" (see the Preface to the First Edition).

==''The New Oxford Companion to Music''==
[[File:Ocm1983.png|thumb|left|200px|''The New Oxford Companion to Music'', 1983]]
In 1983 a wholly revised two-volume work, titled ''The New Oxford Companion to Music,'' was introduced. This was edited by [[Denis Arnold]] who made extensive use of other specialist contributors, some 90 in all. The work was significantly broader in coverage than Scholes' original (there was for instance a perceptive article on [[Bob Dylan]]), and is the most extensively illustrated of the three versions.

Arnold expressed his intention of adhering to Scholes’ principles and indeed included much of Scholes’ material in the new work. Nevertheless, he cut out much of the personal opinion and quirkiness which was characteristic of the original. For instance, he substantially increased the coverage of female composers and performers, who were almost totally absent from Scholes' work.

There were no further revisions of this version, probably due to its relative unpopularity and Arnold's own early death in 1986.

==2002 revision==
[[File:Ocm latham.png|thumb|right|200px|''The Oxford Companion to Music'', 2002 edition]]
In 2002, a third work was produced. This one, edited by Alison Latham, goes back to the original title and to the single-volume format.

Latham assembled her own team of over 120 contributors, some of whom had contributed to the prior (Arnold) edition, and others drawn from her own previous editing work (for example on the ''Grove Concise Dictionary of Music''). This edition consists of some 7400 articles and aims to bring the work up-to-date: for example, in its coverage of areas such as electronic music and computers.

The 2002 revision is more current, handier and more affordable than its predecessor.{{Vague|date=February 2009}} However, it abridges the text and eliminates most of the illustrations.

The text of the 2002 edition can be accessed online via [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/ Oxford Music Online], which is also a portal for [[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]. As well as being available to individual and educational subscribers, it is available for use by members of many libraries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Music Online: [http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&amp;q=oxford+music+online listing] at [[WorldCat]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The (c. 807) '''''Yiqiejing yinyi''''' 一切經音義 "Pronunciation and Meaning in the Complete [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Buddhist Canon]]" was compiled by the [[Tang dynasty]] lexicographer [[Bhikkhu|monk]] Huilin 慧琳 as an expanded revision of the original (c. 649) ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' compiled by Xuanying 玄應. Collectively, Xuanying's 25-chapter and Huilin's 100-chapter versions constitute the oldest surviving [[Chinese dictionary]] of [[Glossary of Buddhism|Buddhist technical terminology]] (for instance, ''Púsà'' 菩薩 or ''Pútísàtuo'' 菩提薩埵 for ''[[Bodhisattva]]''). A recent history of Chinese lexicography (Yong and Peng 2008: 371) call Huilin's ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' "a composite collection of all the glossaries of scripture words and expressions compiled in and before the Tang Dynasty" and "the archetype of the Chinese bilingual dictionary".

==Title==
The dictionary title combines three Chinese words:
*''yị̄qiè'' [[wikt:一切|一切]] "all; whole; every; everything" for [[Sanskrit]] ''sarva'' [[wikt:सर्व|सर्व]] "whole; entire; all; every" 
*''jīng'' [[wikt:經|經]] "[[sutra]]; scripture; canon; classic" for ''sūtra'' [[wikt:सूत्र|सूत्र]] " string; thread; rule (that holds teachings together)"
*''yīn-yì'' 音義 "pronunciation and meaning of a text", with ''yīn'' [[wikt:音|音]] "sound; tone; pronunciation" and ''yì'' [[wikt:義 |義 ]] "meaning; significance", for ''śabdârtha'' "sound and meaning (of words)"
The term ''yīqièjīng'' 一切經 "all the sutras; complete Buddhist canon; [[Tripiṭaka]]" first came into use in the [[Sui dynasty]] (581-618), also known as the ''Dàzàngjīng'' 大藏經, referring to all the classic scriptures or the entire Buddhist canon (Yong and Peng 2008: 219). The term ''yīnyì'' 音義 "pronunciation and meaning", which refers to explaining the phonology and semantics of words, originated in the [[exegesis]] of [[Chinese classics]]. The [[Three Kingdoms]] (220-280) scholar Sun Yan 孫炎 used it in his commentary title ''Erya yinyi'' 爾雅音義 "Pronunciation and Meaning in the ''[[Erya]]''".

There is no regular English translation of ''Yiqiejing yinyi'', compare these renderings:
*''Sounds and Meanings of all the Buddhist Sacred Books'' or ''Sounds and Meanings of the Whole Canon'' (Watters 1889: 52, 382)
*'' The Sound and Meaning of the Tripitaka'' (Chien and Creamer 1986: 35)
*''Pronunciation and Meaning of all Classics'' (Harbsmeier 1998: 426)
*''Sounds and Meanings of all the Buddhist Scriptures'' (Yong and Peng 2008: 110)
*''Glosses of the Buddhist Texts'' (Malmqvist 2010: 158)
*''Sound and Meaning of All Sutras'' (Theobald 2011)
*''A Lexicon of Sounds and Meanings in the Tripitaka'' (Renn 2012: 259)
*''The Sound and the Meaning of All Scriptures'' (Guang 2012: 235)
*''Pronunciation and Meaning of All the Scriptures'' (Buswell and Lopez 2013: 1030)
*''Sounds and meanings for all [the words in the] scriptures'' (Clart and Scott 2015: 125)

Alternate ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' titles include the ''Dazang yinyi'' 大藏音義 "Pronunciation and Meaning in the ''Tripiṭaka''", and to distinguish it from Xuanying's version, the ''Huilin yinyi'' 慧琳音義 "Huilin's Pronunciation and Meaning".

==Author==
There is more biographical information available for the [[Kashgar]] monk Huilin (733-817) than his predecessor Xuanying (d. c. 661). 

The (988) ''Song gaoseng zhuan'' 宋高僧傳 "Biographies of Eminent Song Dynasty Monks" gives a detailed record. Huilin's [[Chinese surname|surname]] was [[Pei (surname)|Pei]] 裴, and he was born in ''Shule'' 疏勒 "[[Kashgar]]" (a city-state in the [[Tarim Basin]], present-day ''Kashi'' 喀什, [[Xinjiang]], the westernmost city in China) (Guang 2012: 235). Huilin was a disciple of Master Bukong 不空 or [[Amoghavajra]] (705-744), one of the [[Shingon Buddhism#Lineage|Eight Patriarchs]] in [[Shingon Buddhism]]. He was a monk at the [[Xi Ming Temple]] in [[Chang'an]] (present-day [[Xi'an]], [[Shanxi]], at the eastern terminus of the [[Silk Road]]). Huilin "inwardly strictly observes the regulations and outwardly studies the Confucian Classics. He has a profound knowledge of Indian philology and exegetic studies" (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 220).

The Chinese [[Dharma name]] Huilin 慧琳 (lit. "Wisdom Gem") was first used by another Buddhist monk. Huilin 慧琳 (fl. 421-445), who was favored by [[Emperor Wen of Liu Song]], wrote the controversial (443) ''Baihei lun'' 白黑論 "Discourse on White and Black" that expressed doubts about [[karmic retribution]].

==History==
In the history of Chinese [[lexicography]], Hulin's ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' was an early Buddhist ''yinyi'' "pronunciation and meaning" dictionary. This genre originated when [[Buddhism]] became a popular Chinese religion in the period between the [[Han dynasty#Eastern Han|Eastern Han dynasty]] (25-220 CE) and [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907). For example, the [[Northern Qi]] (550-577) Buddhist monk Daohui 道慧 compiled the ''Yiqiejing yin'' 一切經音 "Pronunciation in the Complete Buddhist Canon", which did not gloss meanings.

Early translators, including both [[Central Asian]] Buddhist missionaries and Chinese monks, often had difficulties accurately rendering Buddhist terminology from [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]], and [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages]] into [[written Chinese]] (Chien and Creamer 1986: 35). The wide variety of methods, source texts, and exegetical strategies used by different translators of Buddhist texts in the [[Southern and Northern dynasties]] period (420-589) gave rise to a large number of [[neologisms]] and repurposed Chinese terms (Clart and Scott 2015: 125). For instance, Sanskrit ''[[nirvana]]'' is usually [[Transcription into Chinese characters|transcribed]] with the Chinese characters ''nièpán'' &lt; [[Middle Chinese]] ''ngetban'' 涅槃 (Baxter and Sagart 2014), but also had alternate phonetic transcriptions such as ''nièpánnà'' &lt; ''ngetbannop'' 涅槃那, and a similarly pronounced term from [[Daoist]] [[Three Corpses#Chu sanshi jiuchong baoshengjing|internal alchemy]] ''níwán'' &lt; ''nejhwan'' 泥丸 ("muddy pellet; one of the Nine Palaces in the head"). With more and more Indian and Central Asian texts being translated into Chinese, the use of Sanskrit and Middle Indo-Aryan transcriptions and technical vocabulary increased, and became progressively more difficult to comprehend. Meanwhile, errors occurred in the copying and circulation of the scriptures, which the scholar of Buddhism Liu Yu 柳豫 describes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Buddhist scriptures are voluminous and the argumentations in them are profound. They are afflicted with errors and misspellings, and their phonetic notations and semantic interpretations are often rough and neglectful. Days and months are spent in studying and sorting them. There is some progress, but concerns are inevitable. Reflections on them often come to nothing. All the scholars of good will would be troubled by them. (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 207)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Xuanying's purpose in writing the original ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' was to standardize the diverse Chinese Buddhist technical terminology used in the Buddhist canon, gloss correct pronunciation, note variant transcriptions, and give semantic explanations. 

Huilin started to compile the ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' in 788 and finished it in 810 (or, according to another account, started in 783 and finished in 807) (Yong and Peng 2008: 220). The text has two prefaces by Tang scholars, one written by the monk Gu Qizhi 顧齊之 and one by the poet Jing Fan 景審 (Theobald 2011). The preface says Huilin's wordbook "is as vast as the sea, embracing numerous streams and therefore profound, and is as bright as a mirror, reflecting tirelessly the objects in the world" (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 222). In 851, during the reign of [[Emperor Xuānzong of Tang]], Huilin's book was officially included into the Buddhist Canon.

Huilin's dictionary was supplemented by the (987) ''Xu yiqiejing yinyi'' 續一切経音義 "Extended Pronunciation and Meaning in the Complete Buddhist Canon", compiled by the [[Liao dynasty]] monk Xilin 希麟. This 10-chapter dictionary had entries taken from 226 Buddhist scriptures. Each entry gave the phonetic notation, definition, and citations from dictionaries, rime dictionaries, histories, and other classic literature (Yong and Peng 2008: 220). In addition to their value in establishing the Chinese interpretation of Buddhist technical terms, these "pronunciation and meaning" glossaries also serve as important sources for studying the [[Historical Chinese phonology|Chinese phonology]] of their times (Buswell and Lopez 2013: 1031).

Copies of the ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' were later transmitted to Korea and Japan. In 1737, it was first printed in Japan, and those copies were reprinted by [[Qing dynasty]] scholars (Theobald 2011). The Japanese (1924-1934) ''[[Taishō Tripiṭaka]]'' edition of the Chinese Buddhist canon included the ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' (T 54, no. 2128).

==Content==
Huilin spent over 20 years editing the ''Yiqiejing yinyi'', and the resultant dictionary is huge. It comprises 100 chapters/volumes (''juan'' [[wikt:卷|卷]]), with a total of about 600,000 characters. There are 31,000 headword entries for difficult terms excerpted from over 1,300 different Buddhist scriptures (Yong and Peng 2008: 220). 

Huilin compiled his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] as an expanded version of Xuanying's (c. 649) ''Yiqiejing yinyi''. He incorporated all of Xuanying's definitions, with some corrections (Buswell and Lopez 2013: 1031). For the [[collation]] of entries, Huilin copied Xuanying's arrangement by provenance in individual scripture, which in turn was copied from [[Lu Deming]]'s (583) ''[[Jingdian Shiwen]]'' [[exegetical]] dictionary of the Confucian [[Thirteen Classics]]. At the beginning of each chapter, Huilin listed the sutras and chapters from which the headwords are selected. This user-unfriendly method of collating headwords is comparable to the (c. 800) ''[[Leiden Glossary]]'' (Yong and Peng 2008: 370).

Each ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' entry first gives any variant transcriptions of the headword, the ''[[fanqie]]'' pronunciation of rare or difficult characters, Chinese translation, and comments (Buswell and Lopez 2013: 1030). The entry for ''wúfù'' &lt; [[Middle Chinese]] ''mjubjuwH'' 無復 "never again" (Sanskrit ''apunar'' "not again; only once"; Muller 2005) exemplifies Huilin's use of ''[[fanqie]]'' 反切 glosses for pronunciation.
&lt;blockquote&gt;無復 [''wúfù'' &lt; ''mju-bjuwH'']: The second character in the Wú 吳 pronunciation is 扶救切 [''b(ju)'' + ''(k)juwH'' = ''bjuwH'']; in the Qín 秦  pronunciation it is 切 [''b(juwng)'' + ''(m)juwk'' = ''bjuwk'']. (tr. Baxter 1992: 319) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Tang period states of [[Wu (state)|Wu]] and [[Qin (state)|Qin]] correspond to present day [[Jiangsu]]-[[Zhejiang]] and [[Shaanxi]].

Huilin's preface says the  pronunciation glosses were based on "Qinyun" 秦韻 "Qin pronunciation", that is, the [[koiné language]] spoken in the capital Chang'an. Pronunciations in the (c. 807) ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' document [[Historical linguistics|diachronic simplification]] in Chinese phonology, and more closely correlate with the 106 rimes of the (c. 780) ''[[Yunhai jingyuan]]'' rime dictionary than the 193 of the (601) ''[[Qieyun]]'' (Malmqvist 2010: 159).

In order to explain the pronunciations and meanings of difficult words used in Buddhist scriptures, Huilin cited from over 750 lexicographical and commentarial works, including [[rime dictionaries]], [[Chinese character]] dictionaries, ''yinyi'' commentaries to Buddhist scriptures, and commentaries to the [[Chinese classics]]. Many of these are now lost, but have been partly reconstructed on the basis of Huilin's  "ample and carefully attributed" quotations (Harbsmeier 1998: 78).

First, Huilin cited early rime dictionaries, such as the ''Yunquian'' 韻詮 "Rime Interpretation", ''Yunying'' 韻英 "Rime Essentials", and ''Kaosheng qieyun'' 考聲切韻 "Examining Pronunciation in the ''[[Qieyun]]''". These three exemplify the numerous [[lost works]] that were primarily reassembled from ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' citations.

Second, the ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' quotes linguistic information from [[Chinese dictionaries]] and glossaries. Some are familiar lexicons like the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', ''[[Yupian]]'', and ''[[Zilin]]''; others are little known like the ''Zitong'' 字統 "All Characters", ''Gujin zhengzi'' 古今正字 "The Rectification of Ancient and Contemporary Characters", and ''Kaiyuan yinyi'' 開元音義 "Pronunciations and Meanings of Kaiyuan [era 713-741] Characters".

Third, Huilin cited from phonetic-semantic commentaries for Buddhist sutras, such as [[Huiyuan (Buddhist)|Huiyuan]]'s  ''Huayanjing shu'' 華嚴經疏 "Commentary to the [[Avatamsaka Sutra|Garland Sutra]]", and [[Kuiji]]'s  ''Miàofǎ liánhuá jīng yīnyì'' 妙法蓮華經音義 "Pronunciation and Meaning in the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]''" (Yong and Peng 2008: 219). Hulin's dictionary was the first to comment on many Buddhist works.

Fourth, when Buddhist terminology was not included previous dictionaries or commentaries, Huilin quoted commentaries for the Chinese classics, both Confucian and Daoist. For instance, [[Zheng Zhong]]'s commentary to the ''[[Kao Gong Ji|Kaogongji]]'', [[Jia Kui (30-101)|Jia Kui]]'s (賈逵, 30-101) to the ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'', [[Xu Shen]]'s commentary to the ''[[Huainanzi]]'', and [[Sima Biao]]'s to the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]''.

The ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' is not strictly a [[bilingual dictionary]] in the modern meaning of Sanskrit headwords and Chinese translation equivalents, it is technically a [[monolingual]] dictionary of Chinese Buddhist terms. Although early ''yinyi'' glossaries and dictionaries have some basic features of modern bilingual dictionaries, they can be considered as the "most distant forerunners of modern Chinese bilingual dictionaries" (Yong and Peng 2008: 371). 

Within the Chinese "pronunciation and meaning" tradition, Huilin's ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' became the definitive glossary (Buswell and Lopez 2013: 1030). Scholars value it for having accurately recorded the pronunciations and understandings of Buddhist technical terms during the Tang dynasty. Yong and Peng (2008: 220) call it a "huge masterpiece of notation and interpretation of the sounds and meanings of characters in Buddhist scriptures – exhaustively embracing the ancient exegetic interpretations, phonetically notating the Sanskrit classics – and it is broad in collection and rich in content".

Huilin's ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' is valuable for three reasons. It is extremely useful for studying Buddhist scriptures. It is significant to exegesis for providing the pronunciations and meanings of ancient words. And it is the main sourcebook for textual reconstructions, citing many classic works that would otherwise be unknown (Guang 2012: 235). According to the Qing scholar of Buddhism Yang Shoujing 楊守敬 (1835-1915) (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 222), Huilin's ''Yiqiejing yinyi'' "is where philological studies reside and a diamond in the academic forest".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1952">The {{Nihongo|'''Ōmi Code'''|近江令|ōmiryō}} are a collection of governing rules compiled in 668AD, hence being the first collection of [[Ritsuryō]] laws in [[classical Japan]]. These laws were compiled by [[Fujiwara no Kamatari]] under the order of [[Emperor Tenji]].
This collection of laws is now lost and its disputed existence is supported only by short references in later documents (among which the ''[[Tōshi Kaden]]'', a history of the Fujiwara).
It is furthermore missing from the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''.

The ''Ōmi-ryō'', consisting of 22 volumes, was promulgated in the last year of Tenji's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). ''The Imperial House of Japan,'' p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; This legal codification is no longer extant, but it is said to have been refined in what is known as the [[Asuka Kiyomihara Code|Asuka Kiyomihara ''ritsu-ryō'']] of 689; and these are understood to have been a forerunner of the Taihō ''ritsu-ryō'' of 701.&lt;ref&gt;Varley, p. 136 n43.&lt;/ref&gt;
