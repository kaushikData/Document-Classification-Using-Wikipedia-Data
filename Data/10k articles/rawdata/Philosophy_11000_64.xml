[[File:Adrian W. Moore.jpg|thumb|A. W. Moore in 2007 (by Guy Burt)]]'''Adrian William Moore''' (born 1956) is a Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Oxford]] and Tutorial Fellow of [[St Hugh's College]], Oxford. His main areas of interest are: [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Wittgenstein]], [[history of philosophy]], [[metaphysics]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], [[philosophy of logic]] and [[Philosophy of language|language]], ethics and [[philosophy of religion]].

Described as "one of our very best... contemporary philosophers",&lt;ref&gt;"A. Montefiore (2004) "Adrian Moore Reviewed by Alan Montefiore", in [http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/alumni-and-friends/balliol-college-annual-record-2004 "[[Balliol College]] Annual Record"].&lt;/ref&gt; his first book, ''The Infinite'', published by [[Routledge]] in 1990, was considered an "authoritative overview of a topic of considerable philosophical importance",&lt;ref&gt;"[[Roger Penrose|R. Penrose]] (1990) "Things Beyond Saying", in ''The Times Literary Supplement'' 26 October, 4569: 1155."&lt;/ref&gt; a "fine book... admirably clear... [subtle and] sensitive to the philosophical issues."&lt;ref&gt;"L. Angel (1991) "A. W. Moore, ''The Infinite''", in ''Philosophy in Review'' 11(3): 220–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also reviewed favourably in ''Philosophia Mathematica'',&lt;ref&gt;"[[Thomas Tymoczko|T. Tymoczko]] (1994) "A. W. Moore, ''The Infinite'', in ''Philosophia Mathematica'' 2(1):81-6."&lt;/ref&gt; ''International Philosophical Quarterly'',&lt;ref&gt;"[[William Craig (philosopher)|W. L. Craig]] (1992) "Feature Book Review: ''The Infinite'', by A. W. Moore, in ''International Philosophical Quarterly'' 32(2): 253–256."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Times Higher Education Supplement'',&lt;ref&gt;"[[Mary Tiles|M. Tiles]] (1991) "A. W. Moore, ''The Infinite''", in ''Times Higher Education Supplement''."&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Choice''.

This was followed by ''Points of View'' (Oxford University Press 1997): "... a superb book. It brings the rigour, clarity and precision of the best analytical philosophy to bear on a topic that has until now been of pointedly little concern within analytical philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;"[[Mark Sacks]] (1999) "Transcendental Idealism: Between Reproof and Celebration", in ''International Journal of Philosophical Studies'' 7(3): 373–402. See also Nicholas Bunnin's review in ''Philosophy'' (1999) 74(2): 282–95."&lt;/ref&gt; His third book, ''Noble in Reason, Infinite in Faculty: Themes and Variations in Kant's Moral and Religious Philosophy'' was reviewed very laudatorily in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' and ''[[Kantian Review]]''.

His most recent book was published in 2012 by Cambridge University Press with the title ''The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics: Making Sense of Things''. It has been called an “important and remarkable book”&lt;ref&gt;"I. Johansson (2013) "Review: A. W. Moore, The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics: Making Sense of Things", in ''Metaphysica'' 14(1): 127–42.&lt;/ref&gt; and said to represent “an extremely impressive achievement.”&lt;ref&gt;"L. Braver (2012) "A. W. Moore: The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics: Making Sense of Things", in ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'' [http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/29679-the-evolution-of-modern-metaphysics-making-sense-of-things [[2012.03.24]]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
A. W. Moore was educated at The [[Manchester Grammar School]].  He graduated with a B.A. in Philosophy from [[King’s College, Cambridge]], after which he went to Oxford where he studied at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] for his B.Phil and D.Phil in Philosophy, completing the latter with a thesis on ''Language, Time and Ontology'' under the supervision of [[Michael Dummett]].  During his time as a postgraduate at Oxford Moore was awarded the John Locke Prize in Mental Philosophy (in 1980).

== Academic career ==
After receiving his doctorate, Moore spent three years as a lecturer at [[University College, Oxford]], where he also acted as the Junior Dean.  He then returned to Cambridge as a Junior Research Fellow at King's College.  Since 1988 he has been a Tutorial Fellow at St Hugh's College, Oxford and a University Lecturer in Philosophy. Since 2004, he has been a University Professor of Philosophy. He has also been the Chairman of the Oxford University Philosophical Society (1995–96), Chairman of the Sub-faculty of Philosophy (1997–99), and President of the Aristotelian Society (2014–2015).

He is currently a Delegate of the [[Oxford University Press]] and he has been editor of the journal ''[[Mind (journal)|MIND]]'' since 2015, joint with Lucy O'Brien. In October 2017 he was appointed Vice-Principal of St Hugh’s College.

Moore was awarded the [[Mind Association]] Research Fellowship (1999–2000) and a [[Leverhulme Trust|Leverhulme]] Major Research Fellowship (2006–09).

In September 2016 he presented a ten-part BBC Radio 4 series entitled ''A History of the Infinite''.

== Philosophical work ==
{{BLP sources|date=April 2015}}
One of Moore's distinctive contributions to the area of contemporary metaphysics is a bold defence of the idea that it is possible to think about the world 'from no point of view'. This defence is presented in his book, ''Points of View'', which is at the same time a study of ineffability and nonsense. Drawing on Kant and Wittgenstein, he considers transcendental idealism which, he argues, is nonsense resulting from the attempt to express certain inexpressible insights. He applies this idea to a wide range of fundamental philosophical issues, including the nature of persons, value, and God.

Moore's most recent work has been devoted to a thorough study of the history of metaphysics since Descartes, published under the title ''The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics: Making Sense of Things''. Taking as its definition of metaphysics ‘the most general attempt to make sense of things’, the study charts the evolution of metaphysics through various competing conceptions of its possibility, scope and limits: it deals with the early modern period, the late modern period in the analytic tradition and the late modern period in non-analytic traditions. Moore challenges the still prevalent conviction that there is some unbridgeable gulf between analytic philosophy and philosophy of other kinds. He also advances his own distinctive conception of what metaphysics is and why it matters.

Moore is well known not only for his work in the areas or metaphysics and history of philosophy, but also for his contributions to the philosophy of logic and the philosophy of mathematics. In particular, Moore has done much work on the nature of infinity which illustrates his ramified interests. In his book ''The Infinite'', Moore offers a thorough discussion of the idea of infinity and its history, and a defence of finitism. He engages with a wide range of approaches and issues in the history of thought about the infinite, including various paradoxes, as well as the problems of human finitude and death.

In the areas of ethics and religious philosophy, one of the main questions addressed by Moore is this: Is it possible for ethical thinking to be grounded in pure reason? In ''Noble in Reason, Infinite in Faculty: Themes and Variations in Kant's Moral and Religious Philosophy'', Moore looks at Kant’s moral and religious philosophy and uses it to arrive at a distinctive way of understanding and answering this question. Moore identifies three Kantian themes – morality, freedom and religion –  and offers variations on each of these themes in turn. He concedes that there are difficulties with the Kantian view that morality can be governed by ‘pure’ reason, but defends a closely related view involving a notion of reason culturally and socially conditioned.

Moore also has a special interest in the work of [[Bernard Williams]], with whom he was a colleague in Cambridge and about whom he has written extensively. After Williams’ death in 2003 Moore was appointed as one of his literary executors. He edited one of Williams’ posthumously published collections of essays, ''Philosophy as a Humanistic Discipline''.

'''Alan James Ryan''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born 1940) was Warden of [[New College, Oxford]], and Professor of [[Politics]] at the [[University of Oxford]]&lt;ref name=Birth&gt;{{cite web|title=Birthday's today|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/archive/2013-5-9.html |publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 April 2014|date=9 May 2013|quote=Prof Alan Ryan, Warden of New College, Oxford, 1996–2009, 73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently{{as of when|date=July 2018}} a lecturer at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hood, Desmond King, &amp; Gillian Peele, eds, ''Forging a Discipline'', Oxford University Press, 2014, page vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ryan was born on 9 May 1940 in [[London]], England. He was educated at [[Christ's Hospital]], [[Balliol College, Oxford]], and [[University College, London]].  Elected a fellow of New College in 1969, he later taught at Princeton University, and returned to New College, Oxford, in 1996 to take up the Wardenship. He was made a Fellow of the British Academy in 1986.

A political theorist and historian of political thought, Ryan is a recognised authority on development of modern [[liberalism]], and especially the work of [[John Stuart Mill]], having contributed directly to the ‘Reversionary’ school, which led to a re-examination of Mill's work from the 1970s. His academic work also takes in broader themes in [[political theory]], including the [[philosophy of social science]], the nature of [[property]], the history of political thought, and [[liberalism]] of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Ryan has held positions at the Universities of Oxford, [[University of Essex|Essex]], [[University of Keele|Keele]] and [[Princeton University]] and [[University of Virginia School of Law]]. He was also a Visiting Professor of Political Science at The University of Texas at Austin, Australian National University, The New School and many others.

Ryan is a regular contributor to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', and ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', and continues to write on political theory and the history of political thought.&lt;ref&gt;E.g.

[[Aboriginal Australian]]s believe that [[Dreaming (spirituality)|The Dreaming]], cultural values, spiritual beliefs and kin-based relationships of the local people cause some areas or places to be sacred.&lt;ref name=AAP&gt;{{cite web|title=Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority|url=http://www.aapant.org.au|publisher=Northern Territory Government|archivedate=2 May 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502193405/http://www.aapant.org.au/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land and ''The Dreaming''==

The Aboriginal population of Australia is made up of many tribes and nations, each with their own sacred places, animal totems and other items in the geographic area known as their ‘country’.&lt;ref name=Carmichael&gt;{{cite book|title=Sacred sites, sacred places|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-15226-6|editor=David L. Carmichael (et al)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sacred sites are places within the landscape that have a special significance under Aboriginal tradition. Hills, rocks, waterholes, trees, plains and other natural features may be sacred sites.  In coastal and sea areas, sacred sites may include features which lie both above and below water. Sometimes sacred sites are obvious, such as ochre deposits, rock art galleries, or spectacular natural features. In other instances sacred sites may be unremarkable to an outside observer.

''The Dreaming'' refers collectively to Aboriginal religious beliefs. These beliefs endeavour to explain the questions of ultimate human reality, including the origins of humans and animals. The Dreaming is an ongoing phenomenon, incorporating the past, the present and the future. Aboriginal people believe that the Spirits who initially inhabited the land were their ancestors and their identity is derived from the Spirits from whom they descended. Particular tribes have their own totem which is an animal often native to their tribe's territory. Their traditional way of life is based on their relationship with the land, which they believe to be their origin, sustenance and ultimate destiny. They believe it is their duty to look after the land and take only what is needed. The beliefs of the Dreaming are diverse and various. They depend on an individual's tribe, gender, location and totem.

==Traditional custodians and management==

The traditional custodians of the sacred sites in an area are the tribal elders. "Sacred sites give meaning to the natural landscape. They anchor values and kin-based relationships in the land. Custodians of sacred sites are concerned for the safety of all people, and the protection of sacred sites is integral to ensuring the well-being of the country and the wider community."&lt;ref name=AAP/&gt; These sites are or were used for many sacred traditions and customs. Sites used for male activities, such as initiation ceremonies, may be forbidden to women; sites used for female activities, such as giving birth, may be forbidden to men.

==Legislation==

Before 1965 there was no legislation protecting Aboriginal sites in Australia, with the exception of some regulations in the [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=ALRC/&gt; In 1965, the South Australian Government was the first to introduce legislation, and all other States have since done so.&lt;ref name=ALRC&gt;{{cite web|work=Recognition of Aboriginal Customary Laws (ALRC Report 31)|publisher=Australian Law Reform Commission|title=The Recognition of Aboriginal Customary Laws and Traditions Today Recognition through Legislation|url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/6.%20The%20Recognition%20of%20Aboriginal%20Customary%20Laws%20and%20Traditions%20Today/recognition-thro-0#_ftn38|archivedate=19 April 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419133235/http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/6.%20The%20Recognition%20of%20Aboriginal%20Customary%20Laws%20and%20Traditions%20Today/recognition-thro-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Australian Government Department of Environment, Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities|title=Protection under state and territory laws|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/laws/indigenous/protection-laws.html|archivedate=5 June 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605202216/http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/laws/indigenous/protection-laws.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some examples==

Some documented examples of Aboriginal sacred sites in Australia include:

* [[Baiame| Baiame's Cave]]: south of [[Singleton, New South Wales]]
* [[Ban Ban Springs]]: near [[Gayndah, Queensland]]
* [[Kakadu National Park]], [[Northern Territory]] was first inscribed on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Oceania]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Australia.

==Sacred sites in the media==

In June 2008 [[BBC]] released the series ''[[Ray Mears Goes Walkabout]]'', composed of four episodes, where Mears tours the [[Australian outback]]. An accompanying hardcover book was published in the UK by [[Hodder and Stoughton]] in March 2008. In the series, Mears meets one of his heroes, [[Les Hiddins]] (a.k.a. "The [[Bush Tucker]] Man"), and he also headed to the [[Kimberley region]] to meet the reputed [[Indigenous Australians|aboriginal]] artist and bush guide [[Juju Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article3814871.ece |title=Ray Mears discusses bushcraft and his new book about the Australian outback |work=The Times | location=London | first=Melissa | last=Katsoulis | date=25 April 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6824">'''[[Bernard Lewis]]''' (31 May 1916 – 19 May 2018) was a [[British-American]] historian, public intellectual, and political commentator. Lewis' expertise was in the [[history of Islam]] and the interaction between [[Islam]] and the West. He was also noted in academic circles for his works on the history of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing|title=Bernard Lewis|first=Martin|last=Kramer|authorlink=|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|location=London|year=1999|volume=1|pages=719–720|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.martinkramer.org%2Fsandbox%2Freader%2Farchives%2Fbernard-lewis%2F&amp;date=2010-11-13|url=http://www.geocities.com/martinkramerorg/BernardLewis.htm|archivedate=13 November 2010|accessdate=23 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''camera trap''' is a remotely activated [[camera]] that is equipped with a [[motion sensor]] or an [[infrared sensor]], or uses a light beam as a [[Image trigger|trigger]]. Camera trapping is a method for capturing wild [[animal]]s on film when researchers are not present, and has been used in ecological research for decades. In addition to applications in [[hunting]] and [[wildlife]] viewing, research applications include studies of nest [[ecology]], detection of rare species, estimation of population size and species richness, as well as research on habitat use and occupation of human-built structures.&lt;ref name="swann10"&gt;{{cite book |author=Swann, D. E., Kawanishi, K., Palmer, J. |year=2010 |chapter=Evaluating Types and Features of Camera Traps in Ecological Studies: A Guide for Researchers |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=onO2967GdPwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  |pages=27–43 |title=Camera Traps in Animal Ecology: Methods and Analyses |editor1-last=O'Connell |editor1-first=A.

Camera traps, also known as [[trail camera]]s, are used to capture images of wildlife with as little human interference as possible.&lt;ref name=CT1&gt;{{cite web |title=WWF - Camera Traps - More on Camera Traps |url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/camera-traps/moreoncameratraps.html |work=World Wildlife Fund - Wildlife Conservation, Endangered Species Conservation|publisher=World Wildlife Fund |accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the introduction of commercial infrared-triggered cameras in the early 1990s their use has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Camera Trapping |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT2nBQAAQBAJ|editor1=Meek, P. |editor2=Fleming, P. |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |year=2014 |isbn=9781486300396}}&lt;/ref&gt; With advancements in the quality of camera equipment this method of field observation has become more popular among researchers.&lt;ref name=CT2&gt;{{cite web|title=Camera Traps for Researchers, Camera Trap Reviews and Tests.|url=http://www.trailcampro.com/cameratrapsforresearchers.aspx|work=Trail Cameras, Game Cameras Tests and Unbiased Reviews of Camera Traps|accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunting has played an important role in development of camera traps, since hunters like to use them to scout for game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jiao|first1=H. |title=Wireless Trail Cameras|url=http://www.trailcameralab.com/#Wireless_Trail_Cameras|website=Trail Camera Lab|accessdate=11 April 2017|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hunters have opened a commercial market for the devices which have led to many improvements over time.

==Application==
The great advantage of camera traps is that they can record very accurate data without disturbing the photographed animal. These data are superior to human observations, because they can be reviewed by other researchers.&lt;ref name="swann10"/&gt; 
They minimally disturb wildlife and can replace the use of more invasive survey and monitoring techniques such as live trap and release. They operate continually and silently, provide proof of species presence in an area, can reveal what prints and scats belong to which species, provide evidence for management and policy decisions, and are a cost effective monitoring tool. Infrared flash cameras have low disturbance and visibility.&lt;ref name=Cronin&gt;{{cite journal |year=2010 |author=Cronin, S. |title=Camera trap talk |url=http://www.lps.org.au/camera%20traps.pdf |publisher=Photographic Society, April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303225033/http://www.lps.org.au/camera%20traps.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[olfactory]] and acoustic cues, camera [[Flash (photography)|flash]] may scare animals so that they avoid or destroy camera traps. The major alternative light source is infrared, which is usually not detectable by [[mammal]]s or [[bird]]s.&lt;ref name="swann10"/&gt;

Camera traps are also helpful in quantifying the number of different species in an area; this is a more effective method than attempting to count by hand every individual organism in a field. It can also be useful in identifying new or rare species that have yet to be well documented. By using camera traps, the well-being and survival rate of animals can be observed over time.&lt;ref name=CMT4&gt;{{cite web|title=A-Z Animal Index|url=http://siwild.si.edu/index.cfm?species=155|work=Smithsonian Wild|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Camera traps are helpful in determining behavioral and activity patterns of animals, such as which time of day they visit [[mineral lick]]s.&lt;ref name=Blake2010&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Blake, J.

Camera traps are also useful to record animal migrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How a Photographer Captured Stunning Wildlife Photos|url = http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/ng-adventure/150715-riis-camera-trap|website = video.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate = 2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camera traps have revolutionized wildlife research and conservation, enabling collection of photographic evidence of rarely seen and often globally [[endangered species]], with little expense, relative ease, and minimal disturbance to wildlife. Camera traps can document wildlife presence, abundance, and population changes, particularly in the face of deforestation and habitat destruction. Camera traps  enable collection of baseline population data on elusive mammals and birds where only estimates — and often just guesses — were possible before. Camera traps are increasingly being used to raise conservation awareness worldwide, with [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO)s embracing the tool as a powerful way of reaching out to the public through electronic media. Wildlife conservation groups such as [[Panthera]], [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] (WCS), [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) have found camera trap videos and photos to be an important part of campaigns to save threatened or endangered species.&lt;ref name=TM&gt;{{cite journal |title=Camera Traps Emerge as Key Tool in Wildlife Research |journal=Yale Environment 360 |author=Hance, J. |url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/camera_traps_emerge_as_key_tool_in_wildlife_research/2469/ |publisher=Yale University |year=2011 |location=New Haven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Camera types==
The earliest models used traditional film and a one-shot trigger function. These cameras contained film that needed to be collected and developed like any other standard camera. Today, more advanced cameras utilize [[digital photography]], sending photos directly to a [[computer]]. Even though this method is uncommon it is highly useful and could be the future of this research method. Some cameras are even programmed to take multiple pictures after a triggering event.&lt;ref name=OConnell2010&gt;{{cite book |author=O'Connell, A. F., Nichols, J. D., Karanth, U. K. (Eds.) |title=Camera Traps in Ecology: Methods and Analyses|year=2010 |publisher=Springer |location=Tokyo, Dordrecht, London, Heidelberg, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are non-triggered cameras that either run continuously or take pictures at specific time intervals. The more common ones are the advanced cameras that are triggered only after sensing movement and/or a heat signature to increase the chances of capturing a useful image. Infrared beams can also be used to trigger the camera. [[Video]] is also an emerging option in camera traps, allowing researchers to record running streams of video and to document animal behavior.

The battery life of some of these cameras is another important factor in which cameras are used; large batteries offer a longer running time for the camera but can be cumbersome in set up or when lugging the equipment to the field site .&lt;ref name=CMT4/&gt;

===Extra features===
Weather proof and waterproof housing for camera traps protect the equipment from damage and disguise the equipment from animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Griffiths, M. |author2=van Schaik, C. P. |title=Camera-trapping: a new tool for the study of elusive rain forest animals|journal=Tropical Biodiversity|year=1993|volume=1|pages=131–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noise-reduction housing limits the possibility of disturbing and scaring away animals. Sound recording is another feature that can be added to the camera to record animal calls and times when specific animals are the most vocal.&lt;ref name=CT1/&gt;

==Effects of weather and the environment==
[[Humidity]] has a highly negative effect on camera traps and can result in camera malfunction.
This can be problematic since the malfunction is often not immediately discovered, so a large portion of research time can be lost.&lt;ref name=Cronin/&gt; Often a researcher expecting the experiment to be complete will trek back to the site, only to discover far less data than expected – or even none at all.&lt;ref name=OConnell2010/&gt;

The best type of weather for it to work in is any place with low humidity and stable moderate temperatures.
There is also the possibility, if it is a motion activated camera, that any movement within the sensitivity range of the camera’s sensor will trigger a picture, so the camera might end up with numerous pictures of anything the wind moves, such as plants.

As far as problems with camera traps, it cannot be overlooked that sometimes the subjects themselves negatively affect the research. One of the most common things is that animals unknowingly topple a camera or splatter it with mud or water ruining the film or [[Lens (optics)|lens]]. One other method of animal tampering involves the animals themselves taking the cameras for their own uses. There are examples of some animals actually taking the cameras and snapping pictures of themselves.&lt;ref name=OConnell2010/&gt;

Local people sometimes use the same game trails as wildlife, and hence are also photographed by camera traps placed along these trails. This can make camera traps a useful tool for anti-poaching or other [[law enforcement]] effort.

==Placement techniques==
One of the most important things to consider when setting up camera traps is choosing the location in order to get the best results. Camera traps near mineral licks or along game trails, where it is more likely that animals will visit frequently, are normally seen. Animals congregate around mineral licks to consume water and soil, which can be useful in reducing toxin levels or supplement mineral intake in their [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]]. These locations for camera traps also allow for variety of animals who show up at different times and use the licks in different ways allowing for the study of [[ethology|animal behavior]].&lt;ref name=CMT4/&gt;

Another major factor in whether this is the best technique to use in the specific research is which type of species one is attempting to observe with the camera. Species such as small-bodied birds and insects may be too small to trigger the camera. Reptiles and amphibians will not be able to trip the infrared or heat differential-based sensors, however, methods have been developed to detect these species by utilizing a reflector based sensor system. However, for most medium and large-bodied [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[Species (biology)|species]] camera traps have proven to be a successful tool for study.&lt;ref name=OConnell2010/&gt;

"'''Crank'''" is a [[pejorative]] term used for a person who holds an unshakable belief that most of his or her contemporaries consider to be false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=crank Crank] at Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; A crank belief is so wildly at variance with those commonly held that it is considered ludicrous. Cranks characteristically dismiss all evidence or arguments which contradict their own unconventional beliefs, making any rational debate a futile task and rendering them impervious to facts, evidence, and rational inference.

Common synonyms for "crank" include '''crackpot''' and '''kook'''. A crank differs from a [[Fanaticism|fanatic]] in that the subject of the fanatic's [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]] is either not necessarily widely regarded as wrong or not necessarily a "fringe" belief. Similarly, the word ''[[quackery|quack]]'' is reserved for someone who promotes a medical remedy or practice that is widely considered to be ineffective; this term, however, does not imply any deep belief in the idea or product they are attempting to sell. ''Crank'' may also refer to an ill-tempered individual or one who is in a bad mood, but that usage is not the subject of this article.

Although experts in the field find a crank's beliefs ridiculous, cranks are sometimes very successful in convincing non-experts of their views. A famous example is the [[Indiana Pi Bill]] where a state legislature nearly wrote into law a crank result in geometry.

==Etymology==

[[Old English]] ''cranc-'' is preserved in modern English [[crankshaft]], and obsolete ''crancstaef'' "a weaver's instrument".
It is from a [[Proto-Germanic]] stem ''*krank-'' meaning "bend". German ''krank'' has a modern meaning of "sick, ill",&lt;ref&gt;Compare to the German noun, ''Krankenhaus'', i.e., "hospital."&lt;/ref&gt; evolved from a former meaning "weak, small". English ''crank'' in its modern sense is first recorded 1833, and ''cranky'' in a sense of "irritable" dates from 1821. The term was popularised in 1872 for being applied to [[Horace Greeley]] who was ridiculed during his campaign for the U.S. presidency.{{fact|date=July 2018}} In 1882, the term was used to describe [[Charles Guiteau]], who shot U.S. president [[James Garfield]].  Following news reports of Guiteau's trial, ''crank'' spread to describe obsessed baseball fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dickson Baseball Dictionary|last=Dickson|first=Paul|publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]|year=2009|isbn=9780393066814|pages=223–224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mqVXyfqj88oC&amp;pg=PA223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' offered essentially the same definition which is used here:
{{quotation|A crank is defined as a man who cannot be turned.|''Nature'', 8 Nov 1906, 25/2}}

The word ''crackpot'' apparently also first appeared in 1883:
{{quotation|My aunty knew lots, and called them crack-pots.|''Broadside Ballad'', 1883}}

In ''Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary'', the terms ''crackpot'', ''crackbrain'', and ''cracked'' are synonymous, and suggest a metaphorically "broken" head. The terms ''crazy'' and ''crazed'' also originally meant "broken" and derive from the same root word as ''cracked''. The dictionary gives no indication that ''pate'' and ''pot'' have the same root, despite their apparent similarity, and implied colloquial use of ''pot'' to mean "head" in the word ''crackpot''. However, the term ''craze'' is also used to refer to minute cracks in pottery glaze, again suggesting the metaphorical connection of cracked pots with questionable mental health.

The term ''kook'' appears to be much more recent. The [[adjective|adjectival]]-form, ''kooky'', was apparently coined as part of American teenager (or [[beatnik]]) [[slang]], which derives from the pejorative meaning of the noun '''cuckoo'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=kooky&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1958, [[Edd Byrnes]] first played a hair-combing parking lot attendant called "Kookie" on [[77 Sunset Strip]].{{relevance-inline|date=July 2018}} The [[noun]]-form ''kook'', was defined in 1960 in Britain's ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper as "a screwball who is 'gone' farther than most".&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Mail'', 22 Aug 1960, 4/5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common characteristics==

The second book of the mathematician and popular author [[Martin Gardner]] was a study of crank beliefs, ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. More recently, the mathematician [[Underwood Dudley]] has written a series of books on mathematical cranks, including ''The Trisectors'', ''Mathematical Cranks'', and ''Numerology: Or, What Pythagoras Wrought''. And in a 1992 [[UseNet]] post, the mathematician [[John Baez]] humorously proposed a checklist, the [[Crackpot index]], intended to diagnose cranky beliefs regarding contemporary physics.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Baez]], [news:6s22qv$in9$1@pravda.ucr.edu New improved crackpot index] an update to the 1992 list, 26 August 1998, [[sci.physics]] ([https://groups.google.com/group/sci.physics/msg/5312a801e0785e66 archived message] on [[Google Groups]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to these authors, virtually universal characteristics of cranks include:
#Cranks overestimate their own knowledge and ability, and underestimate that of acknowledged experts.
#Cranks insist that their alleged discoveries are urgently important.
#Cranks rarely, if ever, acknowledge any error, no matter how trivial.
#Cranks love to talk about their own beliefs, often in inappropriate social situations, but they tend to be bad listeners, being uninterested in anyone else's experience or opinions.

Some cranks lack academic achievement, in which case they typically assert that academic training in the subject of their crank belief is not only unnecessary for discovering the truth, but actively harmful because they believe it poisons the minds by teaching falsehoods. Others greatly exaggerate their personal achievements, and may insist that some achievement (real or alleged) in some entirely unrelated area of human endeavor implies that their cranky opinion should be taken seriously.

Some cranks claim vast knowledge of any relevant literature, while others claim that familiarity with previous work is entirely unnecessary; regardless, cranks inevitably reveal that whether or not they believe themselves to be knowledgeable concerning relevant matters of fact, mainstream opinion, or previous work, they are not, in fact, well-informed concerning the topic of their belief.

In addition, many cranks:
#seriously misunderstand the mainstream opinion to which they believe that they are objecting,
#stress that they have been working out their ideas for many decades, and claim that this fact alone entails that their belief cannot be dismissed as resting upon some simple error,
#compare themselves with luminaries in their chosen field (often [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Isaac Newton]], [[Albert Einstein]] or [[Georg Cantor]]),{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} implying that the mere unpopularity of some belief is in itself evidence of plausibility,
#claim that their ideas are being suppressed, typically by secret intelligence organizations, mainstream science, powerful business interests, or other groups which, they allege, are terrified by the possibility of their revolutionary insights becoming widely known,
#appear to regard themselves as persons of unique historical importance.

Cranks who contradict some mainstream opinion in some highly technical field, (e.g. [[mathematics]], [[cryptography]], [[physics]]) frequently:
#exhibit a marked lack of technical ability,
#misunderstand or fail to use standard notation and terminology,
#ignore fine distinctions which are essential to correctly understand mainstream belief.
That is, cranks tend to ignore any previous insights which have been proven by experience to facilitate discussion and analysis of the topic of their cranky claims; indeed, they often assert that these innovations ''obscure'' rather than ''clarify'' the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hodges, Wilfrid | title=An Editor Recalls Some Hopeless Papers | journal=The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic | year=1998 | volume=4 | issue=1 | pages=1–16 | url=http://www.math.ucla.edu/~asl/bsl/0401/0401-001.ps | doi=10.2307/421003 | jstor=421003| citeseerx=10.1.1.27.6154 }} A paper describing several attempts at disproving [[Cantor's diagonal argument]], looking at the flaws in their arguments and reasoning.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, cranky scientific theories do not in fact qualify as [[scientific theory|theories]] as this term is commonly understood within science. For example, crank theories in physics typically fail to result in testable predictions, which makes them [[unfalsifiable]] and hence unscientific. Or the crank may present their ideas in such a confused, [[not even wrong]] manner that it is impossible to determine what they are actually claiming.

Perhaps surprisingly, many cranks may appear quite normal when they are not passionately expounding their cranky belief, and they may even be successful in careers unrelated to their cranky beliefs.

==Internet cranks==
{{See also|Usenet personality}}

The rise of the Internet has given another outlet to people well outside the mainstream who may get labeled cranks due to internet [[newsgroup|posting]]s or [[website]]s promoting particular beliefs. There are a number of websites devoted to listing people as cranks. Community-edited websites like Wikipedia have been described as vulnerable to cranks.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-32770712_ITM Fact or fiction? Who contributes to Wikipedia? Despite ... ]", ''[[Global Agenda]]'', March 12, 2007, Retrieved 23 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-26188052_ITM | work=Booklist | title=Wikipedia.(Brief Article) | date=September 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science fiction author and critic [[Bruce Sterling]] noted in his essay in CATSCAN 13:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Online communication can wonderfully liberate the tender soul of some well-meaning personage who, for whatever reason, is physically uncharismatic. Unfortunately, online communication also fertilizes the eccentricities of hopeless cranks, who at last find themselves in firm possession of a wondrous [[soap box|soapbox]] that the [[Trilateral Commission]] and the [[Men In Black]] had previously denied them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/Bruce_Sterling/Catscan_columns/catscan.13 CATSCAN 13: "Electronic Text"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406161505/http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/Bruce_Sterling/Catscan_columns/catscan.13 |date=2012-04-06 }} (Bruce Sterling, ''SF Eye'') Retrieved 8 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are also newsgroups which are nominally devoted to discussing (''alt.usenet.kooks'') or poking fun at (''[[alt.slack]], [[alt.religion.kibology]]'') supposed cranks.

==Crank magnetism==

The term '''''crank magnetism''''' was coined by [[physiologist]] and blogger [[Mark Hoofnagle]] on the ''Denialism Blog'' in 2007 to describe the propensity of cranks to hold multiple irrational, unsupported or ludicrous beliefs that are often unrelated to one another, referring to his claims that [[William Dembski]] endorses both a [[Holocaust denier]] and a [[conspiracy theory]] put forward by [[Peter Duesberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoofnagle|first=Mark|title=Crank Magnetism|url=http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/06/28/crank-magnetism-1/|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crank magnetism may be considered to operate wherever a single person propounds a number of unrelated [[denialist]] conjectures, poorly supported [[conspiracy theories]], or [[pseudoscientific]] claims. Thus, some of the common crank characteristics — such as the lack of technical ability, ignorance of scientific terminology, and claims that alternative ideas are being suppressed by the mainstream — may be operating on and manifested in multiple [[orthogonal]] assertions.

[[Mark Hoofnagle|Hoofnagle]]'s fellow blogger Orac has discussed crank magnetism in relation to the writings of British columnist [[Melanie Phillips]], whom he alleges denies anthropogenic [[global warming]] while promoting [[intelligent design]] and the [[MMR vaccine controversy|discredited view that the MMR vaccine causes autism in children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoofnagle|first=Mark|title=Melanie Phillips: Crank magnetism in action on evolution and vaccines|url=http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/06/melanie-phillips-crank-magnetism-in-acti/|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blogger Luke Scientiæ has commented on the relationship between the number of unrelated claims that magnetic cranks make and the extent of their open hostility to science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Luke Scientiæ|title=A Few Comments on Crank Magnetism|url=http://www.lukesci.com/2011/07/27/a-few-comments-on-crank-magnetism/|accessdate=15 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also coined the phrase "magnetic hoax" in relation to hoax claims that attract multiple crank interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Luke Scientiae|title=The Magnetic Hoax: The Giant Hoax as an Example|url=http://www.lukesci.com/2011/08/15/the-magnetic-hoax-the-giant-hoax-as-an-example/|accessdate=15 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies===
One study, ''NASA faked the moon landing—Therefore (Climate) Science is a Hoax: An Anatomy of the Motivated Rejection of Science'', gave evidence that [[climate change denial]] correlated with [[moon landing conspiracy theories|moon landing]] and [[9/11 conspiracy theories]], staunch beliefs in ''laissez-faire'' [[free-market capitalism]], denial of the [[Health effects of tobacco|link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer]], [[HIV/AIDS denialism]] and [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.#Conspiracy theories|MLK death conspiracy theories]]:&lt;ref name="MOTIVATED REJECTION OF SCIENCE"&gt;Stephan Lewandowsky, Klaus Oberauer, [[Gilles Gignac]]. [http://websites.psychology.uwa.edu.au/labs/cogscience/documents/LskyetalPsychScienceinPressClimateConspiracy.pdf "NASA faked the moon landing—Therefore (Climate) Science is a Hoax: An Anatomy of the Motivated Rejection of Science."] ''Psychological Science'' (in press)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although nearly all domain experts agree that human CO2 emissions are altering the world's climate, segments of the public remain unconvinced by the scientific evidence. Internet blogs have become a vocal platform for climate denial, and bloggers have taken a prominent and influential role in questioning climate science. We report a survey (N &gt; 1100) of climate blog users to identify the variables underlying acceptance and rejection of climate science. Paralleling previous work, we find that endorsement of a ''laissez-faire'' conception of free-market economics predicts rejection of climate science (r ' .80 between latent constructs). Endorsement of the free market also predicted the rejection of other established scientific findings, such as the facts that HIV causes AIDS and that smoking causes lung cancer. We additionally show that endorsement of a cluster of conspiracy theories (e.g., that the CIA killed Martin-Luther King or that NASA faked the moon landing) predicts rejection of climate science as well as the rejection of other scientific findings, above and beyond endorsement of ''laissez-faire'' free markets. This provides empirical confirmation of previous suggestions that conspiracist ideation contributes to the rejection of science. Acceptance of science, by contrast, was strongly associated with the perception of a consensus among scientists.&lt;ref name="MOTIVATED REJECTION OF SCIENCE" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another study titled ''Dead and Alive: Beliefs in Contradictory Conspiracy Theories'' managed to show that, not only will cranks be attracted to and believe in numerous conspiracy theories all at once, but will continue to do so even if the theories in question are completely and utterly incompatible with one another.&lt;ref name="Michael J. Wood"&gt;Michael J. Wood, Karen M. Douglas, Robbie M. Sutton. [https://www.academia.edu/1207098/Dead_and_alive_Beliefs_in_contradictory_conspiracy_theories "Dead and Alive: Beliefs in Contradictory Conspiracy Theories"] ''Social Psychological and Personality Science'' (in press)&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the study showed that: "... the more participants believed that [[Princess Diana]] faked her own death, the more they believed that she was murdered [and that] ... the more participants believed that [[Osama Bin Laden]] was already dead when U.S. special forces raided his compound in Pakistan, the more they believed he is still alive," and that "Hierarchical regression models showed that mutually incompatible conspiracy theories are positively associated because both are associated with the view that the authorities are engaged in a cover-up".&lt;ref name="Michael J. Wood" /&gt;

Studies such as ''Belief in Conspiracy Theories'' state that conspiracy theories relating to the [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|assassination of JFK]], the [[moon landing conspiracy theories|moon landing]] and [[9/11 conspiracy theories|the September 11th attacks]] are united by a common thread: distrust of the government-endorsed story. This leads the believer to attach other conspiracies as well. Someone with a distrust of the government will likely reject any and all stories or reports directly issued by state agencies or other authorities that are seen as part of the establishment. Thus, any conspiracy will seem more plausible to the conspiracy theorist because this fits with their worldview.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Goertzel. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3791630 Belief in Conspiracy Theories.] ''International Society of Political Psychology'', vol. 15, no. 4, 1994. DOI 10.2307/3791630&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultic milieu===
In academic [[sociology]], a similar notion to crank magnetism exists, namely Colin Campbell's concept of the ''cultic [[Social environment|milieu]]'', which he used:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...to refer to a society's deviant belief systems and practices and their associated collectivities, institutions, individuals, and media of communication. He described it as including "the worlds of the occult and the magical, of spiritualism and psychic phenomena, of mysticism and new thought, of alien intelligences and lost civilizations, of faith healing and nature cure" (Campbell 1972:122), and it can be seen, more generally, to be the point at which deviant science meets deviant religion. What unifies these diverse elements, apart from a consciousness of their deviant status and an ensuing sense of common cause, is an overlapping communication structure of magazines, pamphlets, lectures, and informal meetings, together with the common ideology of ''seekership''.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/cult.htm Cult] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114745/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/cult.htm |date=2016-03-04 }}" William H. Swatos, Jr. Editor. ''[[Encyclopedia of Religion and Society]]'', [[Hartford Institute for Religion Research]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Michael Barkun]]'s book ''[[A Culture of Conspiracy]]'' traces the history of certain UFO and "New World Order" conspiracy theories. He finds that these theories and communities were originally distinct, but that certain bookshops and magazines would sell/advertise books of both genres. He traces, over the years, the gradual synthesis as ideas from one milieu start to invade another until both communities routinely refer to both, [[Area 51]] and [[black helicopters]] as part of the same conspiracy canon, for example. He describes the process as [[Improvisational Millennialism]], where people select from existing conspiracy theories to invent their own synthesis. But largely posits that the synthesis as driven by the theories sharing the same transmission channels.&lt;ref name="Culture of Conspiracy"&gt;Barkun, Michael.

'''David Jacobus Bosch''' (13 December 1929 &amp;ndash; 15 April 1992) was an influential [[missiologist]] and [[theologian]] best known for his book ''Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission'' (1991) &amp;mdash; a major work on [[post-colonial]] [[Christian mission]]. He was a member of the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)]]. On Freedom Day, 27 April 2013, he posthumously received the [[Order of the Baobab]] from the [[President of South Africa]] "for his selfless struggle for equality ... and his dedication to community upliftment. By doing so, he lived the values of [[non-racialism]] against the mainstream of his own culture."&lt;ref name="iol._Topn" /&gt;

==Early life==

Bosch was born in [[Kuruman]], [[Cape Province]], [[South Africa]], and died in a motor accident in 1992, aged 62. He was raised in a nationalist [[Afrikaner]] home with little regard for his nation's black citizens and in 1948 when the [[National Party (South Africa)]] came to power and began implementing its program of [[apartheid]] Bosch welcomed it.

That same year however Bosch began studying teaching at the [[University of Pretoria]], where he joined the Student Christian Association and was more exposed to black members of the community. This began a lifelong involvement in [[Christian mission]] and he was soon questioning the apartheid system. He was married to Annemie Bosch.

==Missionary career==
Sensing a call to be a missionary, Bosch changed to the Theological school and graduated with a Bachelor of Divinity and a Master of Arts in languages (Afrikaans, Dutch, German). He then went to Switzerland to study for his doctorate in the field of New Testament at the [[University of Basel]], under [[Oscar Cullmann]], who influenced Bosch to accommodate more [[ecumenism]].

In 1957 Bosch began a decade working as a missionary with the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)|NGK]] planting churches in the [[Transkei]].

==Professor of Missiology==
In 1967 he took up a position as lecturer in church history and missiology at the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)|NGK]]'s Theological School training black church leaders in the Transkei, where he also built ties with the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Anglican]] churches, and began to develop his ministry of writing on mission theory. Bosch wrote about his concerns that the Christian mission to bring good news to black Africans could be confused with colonial and nationalistic motives that entrenched racial divisions.

{{cquote|What is the end goal of mission with such a motivation? Is it to maintain the white people in South Africa--or is it the foundation of the church of Christ...? Is it to serve South Africa--or to serve God? Is it to hear together the sentimental voice of our own blood--or to hear together the last command of Christ? Have we, by this missionary motive, created a sheep in wolf's clothes--or is it perhaps a wolf in sheep's clothes?{{sfn|Bosch|1961}} }}

Isolated from the majority in the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)|NGK]] who supported [[apartheid]], Bosch left his college in 1971 to become Professor of Missiology at the [[University of South Africa]] in [[Pretoria]], which at the time was South Africa's only interracial university. There he edited its journal "Theologia Evangelica" and continued to write.

He was offered the Chair of Mission and Ecumenics at [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] in [[New Jersey]], United States but chose to remain working against [[apartheid]] from within [[South Africa]] and the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)|NGK]]. In 1979 he helped coordinate a gathering of more than 5000 African Christians from every background as a demonstration of the church as an alternative community embodying the [[Kingdom of God]]. In 1982 he promoted an open letter to the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], signed by more than 100 pastors and theologians, publicly condemning apartheid and calling on the church to unite with black churches.

Bosch also bridged evangelical and ecumenical divisions in the global church, participating in both the [[First International Congress on World Evangelization|Lausanne Congress]] and [[World Evangelical Alliance]] events, while also serving the [[World Council of Churches]]. He was an active member of the [[International Association for Mission Studies]] and the key leader, and inspiration of the South African Missiological Society and founding editor of its journal, Missionalia.

He was fluent in [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]] and English, and lectured widely in Europe, Britain, and North America.

He died in an automobile accident on 15 April 1992 in South Africa at the age of 62. His contribution and influence in mission studies globally was immense.

Missiologist Wilbert R. Shenk, senior Professor at [[Fuller Theological Seminary]], writes the following of Bosch in the foreword to ''Believing in the Future''{{sfn|Bosch|1995|pp= ix-x}}
{{cquote|David Bosch's tragic death in an automobile accident April 15, 1992, has left all of us who have known him as a friend, colleague, outstanding mission theologian, and church statesman with a sense of inseparable loss. He combined in his life and ministry first-rate scholarship and devoted Christian discipleship. His loyalty to his native land, South Africa, seemed to be intensified precisely by a personal integrity that required that he live out what he understood the gospel to entail. David Bosch knew existentially, and to a degree most of us never reach, what it means to live and work against the stream of culture--to be countercultural. He was the prophet among us.
Along with his vast knowledge of the field of biblical studies, theology, church history, and missiology, David Bosch had the rare ability to distill the insight and wisdom to meet the demands of the day. His broad sympathies with all parts of the Christian family and his gifts of communication made him a trusted and respected friend wherever he went.}}

== Transforming Mission ==

Bosch wrote more than 150 journal articles and six books, including his magnum opus "Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission" (1991), which was jointly published by the American Society of Missiology and the [[Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America]]'s [[Orbis Books]].

The book was praised as groundbreaking by [[Hans Küng]] who called it the first book on mission to implement paradigm theory. [[Lesslie Newbigin]] nominated it a new standard calling it "a kind of Summa Missiologica" in reference to [[Thomas Aquinas]]' foundational thirteenth century work "[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]". It was selected as one of the "Fifteen Outstanding Books of 1991" by the ''[[International Bulletin of Missionary Research]]''.

The book surveys paradigms of mission both in the [[New Testament]] (reflecting Bosch's careful use of New Testament criticism to trace how mission dynamics shaped scriptural forms and transformations) and through Church history (highlighting that mission has always been shaped for good or ill by its context). He then explores in detail what he sees as an emerging [[post-modern]] or [[ecumenical]] missionary paradigm.

==Quotes==
{{cquote|Mission is, quite simply, the participation of Christians in the liberating mission of Jesus, wagering on a future that verifiable experience seems to believe. It is the good news of God's love, incarnated in the witness of a community, for the sake of the world.{{sfn|Bosch|1991}} }}
{{cquote|Our mission has not life of its own: only in the hands of the sending God can it truly be called mission. Not least since the missionary initiative comes from God alone.{{sfn|Bosch|1991|p=390}} }}
{{cquote|Protestants, in particular, are challenged...with respect to their overly pragmatic mission structures, their tendency to portray mission almost exclusively in verbalist categories, and the absence of missionary spirituality in their churches, which often drastically impoverishes all their commendable efforts in the area of social justice.{{sfn|Bosch|1991|p=212}} }}

When creating a [[contract]], a negotiator is not only doing so to reach an agreement between two or more parties, but to create an agreement that is durable; whereby parties of the contract are legally bound and committed to its promises (Wade and Honeyman 2005, 7). A legally binding contract is defined as an exchange of promises or an agreement between parties that the law will enforce, and there is an underlying presumption for commercial agreements that parties ''intend'' to be legally bound (Contracts 2007).

In order to be a legally binding contract, most contracts must contain two elements:
 • All parties must agree about an offer made by one party and accepted by the other.
 • Something of value must be exchanged for something else of value. This can include goods, cash, services, or a pledge to exchange these items.
 
In addition, certain contracts are required by state law to be in writing (real estate transactions, for example), while others are not.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/contract-law-%E2%80%93-how-create-legally-binding-contract&lt;/ref&gt;

Wade and Honeyman (2007, 7) describe a ‘durable’ contract as one in which all parties substantially perform without abandonment and without resorting to legal proceedings. With only anecdotal evidence, it is difficult to know what percentages of contracts are in fact breached. It is probable that the statistics vary greatly over differing class, culture, wealth and type of transaction (Wade and Honeyman 2005, 7). The reasons for a [[breach of contract]] are also varying, and ethical issues can emerge in some situations.

Some ethical considerations which may become apparent in the durability of contracts are [[cultural relativism]] and [[moral relativism]].

Grace and Cohen (2005, 200) describe cultural relativism as the extent to which different societies and cultures have different values and ethical standards in the fields of business and organisational life. Those who embrace cultural relativism believe that all beliefs (religious, ethical, aesthetic, and political) are relative to the individual within a culture. Types of relativism include moral (where ethics depend on the social assembly), situational (where right or wrong is dependent on the situation), and cognitive (where truth itself has no objective standard). The legislative system is having a harder time defining laws with the diminishing set of standards, and our court system is having a harder time interpreting them (Cultural Relativism – Illogical Standard 2006).

Moral relativism views ethical standards, morality, and positions of right or wrong as being culturally based. This therefore subjects these views as being an individual’s choice. While modern society was previously governed by a "Judeo-Christian" standard, this view has increasingly been acknowledged as the chief moral philosophy of modern society (Moral Relativism – Neutral Thinking?. 2006). However, these "Judeo-Christian" standards continue to be the foundation for civil law, as most people believe that right and wrong are not absolutes, but are determined by the individual.

Following are reasons for breaches in contracts and the way in which these ethical considerations may impact upon them. In most of these situations, the law may not agree with moral or cultural relativism and award in favour of what people generally view as being ‘right’ or ‘wrong’. It is therefore imperative that contracts are created to be as durable as possible so parties are unable to find legal ‘loopholes’ and use their power, wealth, ignorance or cultural differences in setting contracts aside. Following these descriptions is a list of ways on which contracts can be made more durable.

==Cultural Expectations of Flexibility==

In some cultural groups such as Japan, the creation of a contract symbolises the formation of a working relationship, and not a legally binding agreement. Some groups will regard the contract as being flexible in terms that if any problems or issues arise, the parties will reassess the obligations of the agreement and negotiate ways to preserve the relationship (Honeyman and Wade 2007, 8). However, this is not generally the ‘Western’ view on contracts.

In relation to the ethical issue of cultural relativism, a business is obliged to operate in a manner acceptable to the host country, both legally and morally (Grace and Cohen 2005, 19). But what if the contract is not necessarily subject to having a ‘host country’? Is it morally wrong for a Western party to hold a Japanese party to the contract when it is known that the Japanese party would not have intended to be legally bound? Or is it unethical or immoral of the Japanese to sign such an agreement, even though they mean well when signing it, knowing the Western party intended to be legally bound by the contract but themselves see the contract as more of a flexible agreement?

Honeyman and Wade (2007) state that differences in cultural expectations can predictably lead to the more economically powerful party attempting to negotiate that all breaches will be dealt with ultimately by courts from their own culture, applying their own cultural and legal rules.

This then highlights the issue of different legal rules existing in different countries which enable contracts to be set aside. The list of exceptions to finality of contracts varies from one jurisdiction to another, and this is often placed under the label ‘frustration of contracts’.

==Lack of Informed Consent==

Some acts cannot legally take place because of a lack of [[informed consent]]. This can occur under conditions of pressures of limited time, money, exhaustion and exhortations to settle from lawyers. Another person is generally authorised to give consent if an individual is unable to. These cases sometimes result in a party refusing to comply with the terms of the contract; however, they are rarely successful as a defense to an enforcement action. Judges usually take the view that a client advised by a lawyer is strongly presumed both to have a basic understanding of legal principle, and to have given consent (Informed Consent 2007). This was the case in ''Gerbert and Gerbert'' (1990) FLC 92-137, where a husband settled for 10% of assets against his probable entitlement to 40%, and it was held that there was no miscarriage of justice as the husband acted freely and was advised to seek legal advice. In cases where an individual is provided limited facts, serious ethical issues may arise.

Is it ethical to hold someone to a contract when they clearly had no awareness of exactly what they were signing and committing themselves to, due to ignorance or not? Is it ethical for a lawyer to encourage the signing of a document if they are clearly not fully understanding of the document?

==Wealth==

If the chance of success and money is opportune to a wealthy person, their capacity and willingness can give rise to alleging various legal justifications for breach. A few years of legal expenses may only be a small proportion of their empire, and the resulting attrition and disparate investment in the conflict may eventually encourage other parties to renegotiate the disputed clauses (Honeyman and Wade 2005, 15).

In terms of moral relativism, most people would agree that it is ethically wrong to use wealth to control a situation and to ‘force’ people into renegotiating clauses in contracts if they are unable to afford the legal bill accompanying a dispute. However, as moral relativism is subject to a one’s own beliefs on what is right and wrong, some may not view using wealth as a means to control as being the wrong thing to do. In situations such as these, the ‘little man’ usually loses out and will ultimately succumb to the power of the other party or parties.

==Undue Influence==

[[Undue influence]] is an equitable doctrine that involves one person taking advantage of a position of power over another. The law presumes that in certain classes of relationship there will be a special risk of one party unduly influencing their conduct and motives for contracting (Undue Influence 2007). Because the court can vitiate such a contract if there is a special relationship, when no special relationship exists, the general rule is whether there was a relationship of such trust and confidence that it should give rise to such a presumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|41|1936|litigants=[[Johnson v Buttress]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/41.pdf (1936) 56 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 113] |courtname=auto |date=17 August 1936}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such a case is ''Odorizzi v. Bloomfield School District'' CA Ct of App 54 Ca Rpt 533 [1964]. The plaintiff was under contract as a teacher.  He was arrested, and the next day he allegedly was pressured by his superiors to sign and deliver his resignation.  He was cleared of the criminal charges, and then he sought to be reinstated by the school district.  They refused, so he sued to rescind his resignation.  He claimed that his resignation should not be enforced because, among other things, he signed it under the "undue influence" of his superiors.

When a party has placed their confidence and trust in another and this relationship is broken, the view of moral relativism will generally see this situation as being wrong. Undue influence is usually an act of dishonesty and/or deceit in a situation where one party realizes their power over the other and takes advantage of this. Deception and deceit are not viewed as being ethical values inherent in a person.

==Increasing the Durability of Contracts==

As Honeyman and Wade (2005, 15) point out, to increase the chances of ‘performance’ of a contract (and therefore reduce chances of a breach), a party should enhance:

*Entering into contracts with parties where there is already a longstanding relationship – therefore raising incentives to perform promises
*Avoiding making contracts with cultural groups that view contracts as the ‘beginning of a relationship’, rather than a legally binding agreement
*Clarifying whether ‘yes’ means ‘maybe’ or ‘no’ and whether signed and detailed contracts are considered to be binding, morally, legally and/or in reputation, or just amount to the declaration that a working relationship now exists
*Including clauses and a discussion regarding how any future misunderstandings and problems will be addressed
*Attempting to agree that final determination of any future problems with performance will be in a court or arbitration venue
*Only going into contract with parties that are stable and reliable
*Taking out [[risk management]] insurance for non-performance or currency fluctuations
*Attempting to enter into an agreement which recognizes procedural, emotional and substantive needs of all parties involved
*Not walking close to the line on any of the legal rules such as [[duress]], [[deceit]], vague terminology or illegality and this will give other parties the opportunity to claim a loophole
*Attempting to reduce buyer’s remorse by
**Making congratulatory speeches about the agreement’s benefits
**Never agreeing quickly to any clauses
**Adding post-agreement gifts and bonuses
**Publicize the deal by mutual agreement. A wider audience will then place expectations on all parties to perform, or risk losing face and credibility in future arrangements. Most people have a strong desire to act consistently with their own clear commitment

'''Euthymia''' is defined as a normal, tranquil mental state or mood. It is often used to describe a stable mental state or mood in those affected with [[bipolar disorder]] that is neither manic nor depressive, yet is distinguishable from healthy controls. Euthymia is also used to describe the "baseline" of other cyclical mood disorders like [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD) and [[narcissistic personality disorder]] (NPD).  This state is the goal of psychiatric and psychological interventions.&lt;ref name="Concept"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fava|first1=GA|last2=Bech|first2=P|title=The Concept of Euthymia.|journal=Psychotherapy and psychosomatics|date=January 2016|volume=85|issue=1|pages=1-5|doi=10.1159/000441244|pmid=26610048|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/441244}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word "euthymia" traces its roots to the Greek words "eu", meaning well, and "thymo", meaning soul or emotion. The word "[[thymos]]" also had four additional meanings: life energy; feelings and passions; desires and inclinations; and thought or intelligence. Euthymia is also derived from a verb, "euthymeo", that means both "I am happy, in good spirits" and "I make others happy, I reassure and encourage". This is the basis on which the first formal definition of euthymia was built.&lt;ref name="Concept"/&gt;

[[Democritus]] said that the state of euthymia is when "one is satisfied with what is present and available, taking little heed of people who are envied and admired and observing the lives of those who suffer and yet endure". This was later amended in the translation given by the Roman philosopher [[Seneca the Younger]] in which euthymia means a state of internal calm and contentment. Seneca was also the first to link the state of euthymia to a learning process; in order to achieve it, one must be aware of psychological well-being. Seneca's definition included a cache{{Clarify|date=July 2018}} about detachment from current events. Later, the Greek biographer [[Plutarch]] removed this cache with his definition which focused more on learning from adverse events.&lt;ref name="Concept"/&gt;

In 1958, Marie Jodah gave a modern clinical definition of mental health in the terms of positive symptoms by outlining the criteria for mental health: "autonomy (regulation of behavior from within), environmental mastery, satisfactory interactions with other people and the milieu, the individual’s style and degree of growth, development or self-actualization, the attitudes of an individual toward his/her own self". In her definition she acknowledged the absence of disease as being necessary, but not enough, to constitute positive mental health, or euthymia.&lt;ref name="Concept"/&gt;

[[Carol Ryff]] (1989) was the first to develop a comprehensive scale that could assess euthymia: the [[Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being]]. The 84-item scale includes facets of self-acceptance, positive relations with others autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and personal growth. It did not include a notion of [[Psychological resilience|resilience]], which people in the field started working to add in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="Concept"/&gt;

[[Parathymia]] [[on the other hand]], is related to pathological laughter (called "[[Witzelsucht]]").&lt;ref&gt;Black DW. Pathological laughter. A review of the literature. J Nerv Ment Dis. 1982;170(2):67-71. PMID: 7057172.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fakhr al-Dīn Ibrahīm ‘Irāqī''' ({{lang-fa|فخرالدین ابراهیم عراقی}}; 10 June 1213 – 1289), [[Iran|Persian]] [[Sufi]] master, poet and writer.

== Biography ==
Often referred to as '''‘Araqi''', he was born in the village of Komajan near the city of [[Hamadan]] in Persia in 1213.  During his lifetime he spänt many years in [[Multan]], (present day Pakistan) as well as [[Konya]] and [[Tokat]] in present-day Turkey. He is known by many Sufis as a commenter on Sufi teachings, one of the great Persian poets, and an artist. ‘Iraqi is also considered to have reached an exalted station of spiritual realization within the Sufi tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Massé, H. "ʿIrāḳī, Fakhr al-Dīn Ibrāhīm ʿIrāḳī Hamadānī." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010. Brill Online. Augustana. 3 April 2010 &lt;http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-3585&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Islam}}
Born in 1213, ‘Iraqi lived during the height of the revival of Islamic spirituality. ‘Iraqi was highly educated in both theology and literary disciplines and it is believed that he not only knew the Holy Qur'an, [[hadith]], commentary and Islamic theology (Kalam), but that he also knew Persian and Arabic literature.  By the time he was seventeen ‘Iraqi had learned all the sciences there were to teach, and had even begun to teach others.&lt;ref&gt;Chittick, William C. and Peter Lamborn Wilson. ''Fakhruddin 'Iraqi: Divine Flashes.'' New York: Paulist Press, 1982. Pg 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after he began teaching he met a group of [[Qalandariyya|qalandars]] or wandering [[dervishes]] and decided to join them.&lt;ref&gt;On the influence of the Qalandariyya on 'Iraqi, see Ashk Dahlén, ''The Holy Fool in Medieval Islam: The Qalandariyat of Fakhr al-din 'Araqi, Orientalia Suecana'', vol.52, 2004.&lt;http://www.ashkdahlen.com/index.php?id=142&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The group traveled to [[Multan]] where he would eventually be in the service of [[Baha-ud-din Zakariya]] who was the head of the [[Suhrawardiyya]]. Soon after he arrived in Multan he was betrothed to Shaykh's daughter and would have a son with her named Kabiruddin. ‘Iraqi would be in the service of Shaykh for a total of seventeen years during which time he continued to write poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zargar|first=Cyrus|title=Sufi Aesthetics:  Beauty, Love, and the Human Form in the Writings of Ibn 'Arabi and 'Iraqi|year=2011|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, SC|isbn=978-1-57003-999-7|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Shaykh's death ‘Iraqi left Multan and traveled first to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] and then towards present day Turkey.  While in Konya where ‘Iraqi settled for a while he had the honor of meeting [[Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi]] and [[Jalaluddin Rumi]], two of the best known Sufis of all time.  ‘Iraqi would become good friends with Rumi however Quanwi would become a second Sufi master to ‘Iraqi who helped to shape him intellectually, as Shaykh shaped him spiritually. After Rumi's death ‘Iraqi moved to Tokat, also in present-day Turkey.

As ‘Araghi entered old age there was much upheaval in Tokat. The [[Byzantine Empire]] and Prince Kangirtay did not like ‘Iraqi because of the great influence he had over many of the people in Tokat, and the respect with which people honored him.  And so, when Prince Kangirtay tried to have ‘Iraqi arrested he fled to [[Cairo]].  From there ‘Iraqi settled in [[Damascus]] where he would eventually die at the age of seventy-eight in 1289.&lt;ref&gt;Massé, H. "ʿIrāḳī, Fak̲h̲r al-Dīn Ibrāhīm ʿIrāḳī Hamadānī." ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010. Brill Online. Augustana. 3 April 2010 &lt;http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-3585&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

‘Araghi was both a member of the school of Persian Sufi poetry but also has been identified with the [[Ibn Arabian school of Sufism]].  However, ‘Iraqi was also a Gnostic who often spoke in the language of love.  For him, as well as many other Sufis, love was realized knowledge.  ‘Iraqi's writing ''Lama’at'' (''Divine Flashes'') fits into a genre of Sufi writings which expresses certain doctrines in the language of love.

As Shaykh Baha'uddin was dying, he named Fakhruddin 'Iraqi to be his successor.

When it became known that 'Iraqi had been named head of the [[Suhrawardiyya|Suhrawardi Order]], some in the order became jealous and denounced him to the Sultan who sought to have 'Araghi arrested.

'Iraqi fled the area with a few close companions, and they eventually made their way to [[Makkah]] and [[Medina]]. Later they moved north to [[Konya]] in Turkey. This was Konya at the time of [[Rumi]]. 'Araghi often listened to Rumi teach and recite poetry, and later attended Rumi's funeral.

Although 'Araghi was nominally the head (in exile) of a large and respected Sufi order, he humbly became the disciple of another Sufi master [[Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi]], who also lived in Konya at the time. Qunawi was the son-in-law of the recently deceased Sufi philosopher [[Ibn 'Arabi]]. Although less known in the West today, Qunawi was perhaps the pre-eminent Sufi teacher in Konya at the time, even better known than his neighbor Rumi.

'Iraqi was deeply devoted to Qunawi and to the teachings of [[Ibn 'Arabi]]. It was a series of speeches [[Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi|al-Qunawi]] delivered on the esoteric meaning of [[Ibn 'Arabi]]'s great works that inspired 'Iraqi to compose his own masterpiece of commentary and poetry named the [[Lama'at]] or Divine Flashes.

== Works ==
''Lama’at'' or ''Divine Flashes'' is the best known of ‘Iraqi's writings and was written during his time in what is now Turkey.  A part of the ‘language of love’ genre within Sufi writing, it takes an interesting view on how one view the world.  Unlike others before him ‘Iraqi viewed the world as a mirror which reflected God's Names and Qualities and not as a "veil" which must be lifted.
According to (the late) Baljit Singh Ph.D., an Indian Persian scholar and translator of SWANEH of Ahmad Ghazali and Iraqi's LAMMAT (The Flashes), "The style of Lammat is a simple, dignified, fluent &amp; rich with Qur'anic verses and Arabic sentences. Its theme is ‘Divine Love’ and is written in the fashion of the Swaneh of Ahmad Ghazali. Iraqi explains in the Lammat, Ibn Arabi's Sufism through the love symbology." He quotes from Saed Nafisi's ‘Introduction’ to the ‘Kullyat Iraqi’-‘Generally it is accepted that Iraqi wrote Lammat following the ideas of Ibn Arabi, but Iraqi himself says differently. He writes in the beginning of the Lammat that he has written this book in the manner of ‘Swaneh’ of Ahmad Ghazali.’ Baljit Singh further refers to Dr Nasrullah Pourjavadi, a scholar on Ahmad Ghazali and writes, "It was Ahmad Ghazali who first of all saw the Divine as love and founded the Sufi Metaphysics of Love. Iraqi is said to have united Ahmad Ghazali to Ibn Arabi through his LAMMAT."&lt;ref&gt;Baljit Singh Ph.D: LAMMAT (The Flashes) by FAKHRUDDIN IRAQI, English Rendering,  First Edition : June 2003, Publishers: Sikh Foundation, New Delhi. {{ISBN|81-7873-007-3}}, Pg 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Lama’at'' has been translated into [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].

''‘Ushshaq-namah'' ({{lang|fa|عشاق‌نامه}}) was, according to legend, written during ‘Iraqi's time in service to Shaykh and is dedicated to Shamsuddin Juwayni the vizier.  While it has been attributed to 'Iraqi, it is almost definitely not his.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zargar|first=Cyrus|title=Sufi Aesthetics:  Beauty, Love, and the Human Form in the Writings of Ibn 'Arabi and 'Iraqi|year=2011|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia SC|pages=96 and 194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldick|first=R.

The '''Gnostic Church of France''' ({{lang-fr|'''Église gnostique de France'''}}) is a [[neo-Gnostic]] Christian organisation formed by [[Jules Doinel]] in 1890, in France. It is the first [[Gnostic]] church in modern times.

The [[esoteric]] [[Freemason]] Jules Doinel, while working as archivist for the library of [[Orléans]] in France, he discovered a medieval manuscript dated 1022, which had been written by Stephen, a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of the [[Orléans Cathedral]], burned at the stake in 1022 for his pre-[[Cathar]] Gnostic doctrines (see [[Orléans heresy]]).&lt;ref name=HMF&gt;{{cite book |last=Roggemans |first=Marcel |translator=Bogaard, Milko |date=2009 |title=History of Martinism and the F.U.D.O.S.I. |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_Martinism_and_the_F_U_D_O_S_I.html?id=W4SBPgAACAAJ |location=Morrisville, North Carolina |publisher=Lulu Press |pages=37–38 |isbn=978-1-4092-8260-0 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doinel founded the Gnostic Church in 1890, a date which opened for him and his followers ‘the 1st year of the Restoration of [[Gnosis]]’.&lt;ref name=LAG&gt;{{cite book |last=Fabre des Essarts |first=Léonce-Eugène-Joseph |date=1899 |title=L’Arbre gnostique |url= |location=Paris |publisher=Librairie Chamuel |pages=67–69 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doinel claimed that he had a vision in which the [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeon]] [[Gnosticism#Jesus as Gnostic saviour|Jesus]] appeared, He charged Doinel with the work of establishing a new church. When Doinel attended a [[séance]] in the [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] of the [[Marie Sinclair, Countess of Caithness|Countess of Caithness]], it appears that the disembodied spirits of ancient [[Albigensians]], joined by a heavenly voice, laid spiritual hands on Doinel, creating him the bishop of the Gnostic Church.&lt;ref name=HMF /&gt;

As [[patriarch]] of the new Church, Doinel took the mystical name ‘Valentinus II, Bishop of the Holy Assembly of the [[Paraclete]] and of the Gnostic Church’, and nominated eleven [[titular bishops]], including a ‘[[Sophia (Gnosticism)|sophia]]’ ([[Ordination of women#Christianity|female bishop]]), as well as deacons and deaconesses. The [[Symbolist poet]] {{ill|Léonce Fabre des Essarts|fr}} was named bishop of [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref name=LAG /&gt; The dress of Gnostic bishops is characterized by purple gloves and the use of [[Tau]] symbol, a Greek letter which is also used before their names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jean Kostka (Jules Doinel) |date=1895 |title=Lucifer démasqué |url= |location= |publisher= |pages=139–141 |isbn= |language=fr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, Doinel consecrated [[Papus]]—founder of the first [[Martinist Order]]—as Tau Vincent, Bishop of [[Toulouse]]. Other Martinists, such as {{ill|Paul Sédir|fr}} and {{ill|Lucien Chamuel|nl}} were also consecrated by Doinel. At the end of 1894, Doinel abjured his Gnostic faith and converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] due to the [[Taxil hoax]]. He returned to Gnosticism five years later under the mystical name Simon and the title ‘[[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of Samaria’.

In 1908, a schism occurred when the Gnostic bishop of [[Lyons]], [[Jean Bricaud]], renamed his branch as {{lang|fr|'''Église gnostique catholique'''}} (E.G.C.; Catholic Gnostic Church). Then it changed again becoming the {{lang|fr|'''Église gnostique universelle'''}} (E.G.U.; Universal Gnostic Church) and became the official church of [[Papus]]’ Martinist Order. The patriarch Bricaud claimed the spiritual heritage of [[John of Patmos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=8 November 1910 |title=Title unknown |trans-title= |url= |language=fr |newspaper=[[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]] |pages=1–2 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The E.G.U. later changed its name to {{lang|fr|'''Église gnostique apostolique'''}} (E.G.A.; Apostolic Gnostic Church).&lt;ref name=HMF /&gt; Meanwhile, the original {{lang|fr|Église gnostique}} in Paris had been taken over by [[Léon Champrenaud]] (Théophane), it later disintegrated under Patrice Genty (Basilide) in 1926.&lt;ref name=HMF /&gt;

== Église Gnostique Catholique Apostolique ==
The {{lang|fr|Église Gnostique Catholique Apostolique}} (E.G.C.A.), in [[Latin]] {{lang|la|Ecclesia Gnostica Apostolica Catholica}} (not to be confused with {{lang|la|[[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]]}}), or known as the Gnostic Catholic Apostolic Church of North America, which operates in [[New York City|New York]], claims the heritage of {{lang|fr|Église gnostique de France}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apostolicgnosis.org/ |title=The Gnostic Catholic Apostolic Church of North America |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.apostolicgnosis.org |publisher= |accessdate=19 April 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This church is in a state of fraternal alliance (concordat) with the [[Ecclesia Gnostica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gnosis.org/ecclesia/ecclesia.htm |title=ECCLESIA GNOSTICA: Relation to other Churches and Organizations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=gnosis.org |publisher= |accessdate=19 April 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the latter, it also accepts the [[ordination of women]] and [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apostolicgnosis.org/cokinis.html |title=Bishop Robert Cokinis - Tau Charles Harmonius II |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.apostolicgnosis.org |publisher= |accessdate=19 April 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the E.G.C.A. has affiliation with two other initiatic organisations: the ''Ordre Martiniste of North America'' and the ''Aesthetic Rose+Croix Order of the Temple and the Grail''. The latter is a reconstitution of [[Joséphin Péladan]]’s [[Salon de la Rose + Croix|Ordre de la Rose ✠ Croix Catholique et Esthétique du Temple et du Graal]].

== Église Gnostique and Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica ==
The ''[[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]]'' (E.G.C.) descended from a line of the 19th-century French Gnostic revival churches ({{lang|fr|Église Gnostique}}) mentioned above (see [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica#History]]). These {{lang|fr|Églises Gnostiques}} plus the contemporary {{lang|fr|Église Gnostique Catholique Apostolique}} are essentially Christian in nature{{huh|date=May 2018}}. Although [[Gnosticism]] is seen as [[heresy]] in an [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] Christian sense, the E.G.C. goes even further by worshipping such figures like [[Babalon]], [[Baphomet]], et cetera.

{{Chinese Political Realism}}
The '''''Guanzi''''' ({{zh|c=管子}}) is an ancient Chinese political and philosophical text that is named for and traditionally attributed to the 7th century BCE statesman [[Guan Zhong]], who served as Prime Minister to [[Duke Huan of Qi]].{{sfnp|Rickett|1993|p=244}} At over 135,000 characters long, the ''Guanzi'' is one of the longest early Chinese philosophical texts. The [[Han Dynasty]] scholar [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] edited the received ''Guanzi'' text circa 26 BCE. It contains a wide variety of material from many different authors over several successive centuries, largely associated with the 4th century BCE [[Jixia Academy]] in the [[Qi (state)|Qi]] capital of [[Ancient Linzi|Linzi]],{{sfnp|Rickett|1993|p=244}}&lt;ref&gt;Ricket, Guanzi (1985) p.3&lt;/ref&gt; but it might not have been compiled until after the [[Han Feizi]].&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.357 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA357&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ming dynasty agricultural scientist [[Xu Guangqi]] frequently cited the Guanzi and the [[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]].&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Handlin Smith 2009 p.252. The Art of Doing Good: Charity in Late Ming China&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
As is typical of an ancient Chinese text, the organization of the ''Guanzi'' has been altered over time, both the chronology and  significance of which isn't all that clear. Covering a wide variety of subjects, ranging from detailed economic discussions to overviews of local soil topography, many chapters include Confucian values as a necessity for the state, expressing a blend of what may be considered Legalistic, Confucian, and [[Daoism|Daoist]]ic philosophy that has been termed "[[Huang-Lao]]". The first reference to the collection appears in the more Taostic [[Huainanzi]], of the early [[Han dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;Ricket, Guanzi (1985) p.3, (1993) p.244
* Chad Hansen, 1992 p.357 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA357&lt;/ref&gt; and Han bibliographies listed the text as Taoist.&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Graham 1989. p.268. Disputers of the Tao. https://books.google.com/books?id=QBzyCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA268&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''[[Neiye]]'' ("Inner Enterprise/Training") chapter has some of the oldest recorded descriptions of Daoist meditation techniques.

&lt;blockquote&gt;When you enlarge your mind and let go of it,&lt;br&gt;
When you relax your [''[[qi]]'' 氣] vital breath and expand it, &lt;br&gt;
When your body is calm and unmoving: &lt;br&gt;
And you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances. &lt;br&gt;
You will see profit and not be enticed by it, &lt;br&gt;
You will see harm and not be frightened by it. &lt;br&gt;
Relaxed and unwound, yet acutely sensitive, &lt;br&gt;
In solitude you delight in your own person. &lt;br&gt;
This is called "revolving the vital breath": &lt;br&gt;
Your thoughts and deeds seem heavenly. (24, tr. Roth 1999:92) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was classed as Legalist after the [[Sui dynasty]] (581-617). Most chapters of the text deal with government and the art of rulership. Considering their tone generally less strident than in the classic Legalist work, the [[Book of Lord Shang|''Book of Lord Shang'' (''Shang jun shu'' 商君書)]], translator [[W. Allyn Rickett]] dissents from the traditional Confucian view of the texts as Legalist, judging them to "present a point of view much closer to that of the realistic Confucian, Xunzi than either the highly idealistic Confucianism of Mencius or the Draconian Legalism advocated by Shang Yang." The Guanzi shares with other "Legalist" texts the view that power is independent of morality, emphasizing techniques (Shu), but advocates "law" (Fa) as an adjunct to Confucian [[Li (Confucianism)|Li]].

'''Gururaj Ananda Yogi''' (birth name: Purushottam Narsinhram Valodia, 3 March 1932 in [[Gujarat]], India &amp;ndash; 17 May 1988 in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gururaj Ananda Yogi, Guru,Spiritual Master &amp; Philosopher|url=https://www.fisu.org/about-meditation-training-centres/founders-and-leaders/gururaj-ananda-yogi/|website=Foundation for International Spiritual Unfoldment}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the founder of [[International Foundation of Spiritual Unfoldment]] and [[Foundation for International Spiritual Unfoldment]] (FISU), another meditation society, is also based on his teachings.&lt;ref name="FisuYogProfile"&gt;Staff. [http://www.fisu.org/en/about-fisu/founders-leaders/gururaj-ananda-yogi-life-profile Gururaj Ananda Yogi Life Profile], fisu.org, retrieved 2009-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Gururaj Ananda Yogi started giving [[satsang]] in his living room at his home in South Africa and during 1974 with the help of some of his disciples in South Africa started The South African Meditation Society and The International Foundation for Spiritual Unfoldment. On October 1974 Marguerite Cusley (alias Gita) a teacher from [[Transcendental meditation]] of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]], organized for him a trip to the UK where Gururaj Ananda was introduced to many TM teachers from around the world and who soon joined his movement, The International Foundation for Spiritual Unfoldment (IFSU).

Within that organization several National Mediation Societies were created that are today continuing teaching meditation in different countries around the world. Among them: The British Meditation Society,&lt;ref name="BritishMedSoc"&gt;[http://www.britishmeditationsociety.org/ British Meditation Society]&lt;/ref&gt; The American Meditation Society,&lt;ref name="AmericanMedSoc"&gt;[http://americanmeditationsociety.org American Meditation Society]&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish Meditation Society,&lt;ref name="SpanishMedSoc"&gt;[http://sem.com.es Spanish Meditation Society]&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish Meditation Society,&lt;ref name="DanishMedSoc"&gt;[http://gururaj.dk Danish Meditation Society]&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish Meditation Society, The Belgian Meditation Society, The Canadian Meditation Society and The Israeli Meditation Society. These societies and IFSU are the actual copyright holders of Gururaj's recorded teachings and are engaged in making a major publishing effort in association with publishers in both the USA and Spain.

Gururaj Ananda Yogi was a philosopher, a mystic and a poet who taught in the time-honored methods of the oral tradition. His disciples recorded most of his talks, both public and informal. Some of those transcribed talks have been compiled into books&lt;ref name="FisuBooks"&gt;Staff. [http://www.fisu.org/acatalog/FISU_Books.html FISU books], fisu.org, retrieved 2009-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular relevance was the one published in Spain by [[Espasa Calpe]] that received very good critics in the general press.&lt;ref name="Elmundo"&gt;Guitian, Belen Reyes (1996-03-26). [http://www.elmundo.es/papel/hemeroteca/1996/03/26/cultura/97848.html Espasa propone «recetas espirituales» para el fin de siglo], elmundo.es, retrieved 2009-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio Gala]] in his articles in ''[[El País]]'' every Sunday used to find inspiration in the quotes from Gururaj Ananda Yogi.

During 2005&amp;ndash;2006 BISC in [[University of California at Berkeley]] started a project to put all his recorded teachings online using fuzzy logic to do natural language search over them that had to be stopped due to lack of funds.&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;Staff. [http://www-bisc.cs.berkeley.edu/BISCProgram/Visitors.htm BISC Visitors &amp; Visiting Program], www-bisc.cs.berkeley.edu, retrieved 2009-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his lifetime as a [[guru]], Gururaj used to refer to the spiritual path as ''The Path of Unfoldment''. After his death, two of his prime disciples, Rajesh Ananda,&lt;ref name="FisuRajesh"&gt;Staff. [http://www.fisu.org/en/about-fisu/founders-leaders/rajesh-ananda-profile/ Rajesh Ananda Profile], fisu.org, retrieved 2009-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jasmini Ananda&lt;ref name="FisuJasmini"&gt;Staff. [http://www.fisu.org/en/about-fisu/founders-leaders/jasmini-ananda-profile/ Jasmini Ananda Profile], fisu.og, retrieved 2009-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt; founded [[Foundation for International Spiritual Unfoldment]], being the continuation of Gururaj's teachings,&lt;ref name="FisuYogProfile"/&gt; follows the ''[[Meditation for Spiritual Unfoldment]]'' school of thought that promotes Gururaj's teachings for ''The Path of Unfoldment''. This and the fact that Rajesh Ananda and Jasmini Ananda  were prepared and initiated by Gururaj to be his successors, is debated by IFSU despite conclusive evidence and various recordings that confirm this.  However, over the last 22 years since Gururaj physical passing, the organisation headed by Rajesh Ananda and Jasmini Ananda has become the largest and most successful organisation in the world with 80 branches in 13 different countries and they continue to grow at an accelerated pace having strong founded leadership and guruship by promoting Gururaj's teachings. FISU has become one of the world's largest and most active meditation schools and is continually expanding.

'''Sayyid Baha al-Din Haydar, Haydar al-'Obaidi al-Hossayni Amuli''', or '''Seyyed Haydar Amoli''' or '''Mir Haydar Amoli''' a [[Shi'ite]] mystic and a [[Sufi]] [[philosopher]], was an early representative of Persian [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] and one of the most distinguished commentators of the mystic philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]], during the 14th century.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Haydar Amuli belongs to the Hussayni Sayyid family and hails from the town of [[Amol]], in [[Mazandaran]], located in the north of present-day [[Iran]], close to the [[Caspian Sea]]. The town of Amul at the time was known to be heavily populated by [[Shi'ite]] Muslims. At a very young age he started studying Imam Shi'ism and attended the juridical school of ''[[madhhab]]'' where he also devoted his time to Sufism, until around the age of thirty.&lt;ref name="inner secrets"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his early twenties, Sayyid Haydar Amuli returned to Amul and became a trusted confidant and eventually a special deputy and chamberlain to the [[Bavandid]] [[Hasan II (Bavandid ruler)|Hasan II]], who was the ruler of [[Tabaristan]].&lt;ref name="inner secrets" /&gt; Even though Amuli had a close relationship with Hasan II, he experienced a religious crisis. Amuli quotes in his work ''Inner Secrets of the Path'' that he started to feel that he was corrupt and that he needed to move to a place where he could fully devote himself to God. So Haydar Amuli gave up his position in the court to further pursue [[Sufism]]. He abandined the courtly life, a couple of years before Hasan II was assassinated by members of his own family.&lt;ref name=Kohlberg&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

=== Return to Sufism ===
After Haydar Amuli's departure from the court, he began practicing Sufism. Living in the village of Tihran, he began to follow a shaykh by the name of Nur al-Din Tihrani, a gnositc and [[asceticism|ascetic]] of Allah. Amuli spent a little less than a month in his company before going on to wear the symbolic Sufi cloak or [[khirqa]].&lt;ref name="inner secrets" /&gt; Eventually, Haydar Amuli went on to embark on a pilgrimage or [[Hajj]], going on to visit various Shi'ite shrines and also traveling to Jerusalem as well as the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. Unfortunately, due to ill health, Amuli had to leave Medina
.&lt;ref name=Kohlberg /&gt; It is documented that he spent the rest of his life in Iraq. For several years he studied in Baghdad amongst important Shi'ite scholars including Fakhr al-Din Muhammad al-Hasan and Nasir al-Din al-Kashani al-Hilli. These two scholars were prominent figures in Shi'ism at the time. Haydar al-Amuli then settled in the Shi'ite city of [[Najaf]], south of Baghdad, for over thirty years until around 1385 CE, the year he was last documented to be living. This is also around the same time that he completed his last work, called ''Resalat al-olum al-aliya''.

== Amuli's Main Ideas ==

=== Synthesis of Shi'ism and Sufism ===
Early on Amuli was a supporter of Imamite Shi’ism. Similar to Sufism, Shi’ism involves the ideas of [[Shari'a|šarīʿa]], [[Tariqa|ṭarīqa]] and [[Haqiqa|ḥaqīqa]]. Amuli believed that every Shi’ite was “a believer put to the test”, a central Sufi belief. One of Amuli’s main ideas was that the Imams, who were believed to be endowed with mystical knowledge, were not just guides to the Shi’ite community but also to the Sufi community. Amuli was both a critic of Shi’ites who limited their religion to a set of rules and equally critical of Sufis who denied certain principles that originated with the Imams.&lt;ref name=Kohlberg /&gt;

=== Pure Monotheism ===
Amuli also implemented and further explained the differences between pure [[monotheism]] and the inner aspect. Pure monotheism is constituted by the profession of faith and of the idea of the outward aspect of God’s unity. The inner aspect involves the idea that nothing else exists except for God.&lt;ref name=Kohlberg /&gt; Amuli metaphorically explained the idea of the inner and outward aspects as ink and the letters that are produced by that ink. The letters by themselves do not exist without the ink. Amuli meant that the physical world is only a manifestation of God’s divine names.&lt;ref name=Kohlberg /&gt;

=== The Seal of Walāya ===
Another belief of Amuli related to the arrival of the twelfth Imam, Mahdī. Amuli’s idea of the twelfth Imam follows the ideas of previous scholars. Amuli specifically believed that ‘Ali was the seal of the universal [[Walayah|walāya]] and Mohammadan walāya is, for Amuli, the [[Mahdī]]. These ideas differ from that of [[Ibn ‘Arabi]] in that al’Arabi believes that [[Jesus Christ]] was the seal of the universal walāya.&lt;ref name=Kohlberg /&gt;

== Works ==
It is documented that Sayyid Haydar Amuli wrote over forty different works, but of those only seven remain.&lt;ref name=Kohlberg /&gt; In '''Asrār al-šarīʿa wa aṭwār al-ṭarīqa wa anwār al-ḥaqīqa''', Amuli individually discusses his five basic principles of religion: divine unity, prophecy, eschatology, Imamate and justice. He also mentions the five pillars of Islam prayer, including fasting, zakāt, haǰǰ, and ǰehād. He discusses all of these topics from three different points of view, the šarīʿa, the ṭarīqa, and the ḥaqīqa. '''Jāmeʿ al-asrār wa manbaʿ al-anwār''' is the most famous of Amuli’s writings. It is divided into three books and each book is separated into four chapters or (qāʿeda). '''al-Masāʾel al-āmolīya (or al-ḥaydarīya)''' is a work that consists of theological and juridical ideas that are addressed by Amuli written to his teacher Faḵr-al-moḥaqqeqīn. From this work an autograph is preserved. Amuli wrote, '''Resālat al-woǰūd fī maʿrefat al-maʿbūd''', in 1359 CE. It was completed while Amuli was residing in Naǰaf around 1367 CE. '''[[al-Mohit al-azam|al-Moḥīṭ al-aʿẓam]]''' is a seven volume commentary that was completed around 1375 or 1376 CE. This work titled, '''Naṣṣ al-noṣūṣ'''  is a commentary on another piece written by Ibn Arabi, titled Foṣūṣ al-ḥekam. This piece includes some autobiographical passages that provide information about Amuli’s life. Amuli's last work was titled, '''Resālat al- ʿolūm al-ʿālīya''' is a collection of Imamite traditions credited to Amuli. It is often debated that it was actually written by a different author.&lt;ref name=Kohlberg /&gt;

=== Notable Quote ===
''"The ocean is the same ocean as it has been of old; The events of today are its waves and its rivers."''

''"Indeed I swear by Allah that if the seven heavens were made of paper and the trees of the earth were pens, if the seas of the world were ink and the spirits, mankind and the angels were scribes, then they would be unable to write even a jot of what I had witnessed of the divine gnoses and realities"''

== Legacy ==
Amuli is not the only Imamite thinker to incorporate the writings of Ibn ‘Arabi and his followers. The  joining of both Sufism and Shi'ism was further explored throughout history by more scholars like Amuli. Scholars such as, Mir Damad, Mulla Sadra, Hadi Sabzavari, and Ayatollah Khomayni continued to establish a connection between Sufism and Shi’ism.&lt;ref name=Meri /&gt;[http://alhassanain.org/english/?com=book&amp;id=767 Book of Haytdar Amuli: Inner Secrets Of The Path]

==Life==
Boudon was born in [[La Fère]] in [[Picardy]] to Jean and Antoinette Jourdin Boudon. His father was lieutenant of the citadel. After 15 years of childless marriage his mother prayed for a child, which prayers became only more intense with the death of their first born shortly after birth. The town of [[Liesse-Notre-Dame]] is situated about {{convert|28|mi|km}} northwest of Reims. Liesse-Notre-Dame (Our Lady of Joy) is a center of Marian pilgrimage, and was a favorite shrine of Princess [[Henrietta Maria of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Wedgwood, C. V. (1970) The King's War: 1641–1647. London: Fontana&lt;/ref&gt; On her way to Liesse, in company with her mother, [[Marie de' Medici]], and sister-in-law, [[Anne of Austria]], she happened to pass through La Fère on the day of the infant Boudon's christening. The princess agreed to be the child's godmother and he was baptized Henri-Marie.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;

Not long after his christening, his parents made a pilgrimage to Liesse, where his mother dedicated the child to Mary, Queen of Angels and invoked her protection of him.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; His father died shortly thereafter, and his mother soon remarried. At the age of eleven Henri-Marie was sent to attend the Jesuit college at [[Rouen]].&lt;ref name=CR/&gt; Later he studied at the [[Sorbonne]].

He was ordained in January, 1655.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9S8EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=Henri+Boudon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yLdtdZXHYK&amp;sig=mzUCU7jDn752TZ9_MKDsAdlEy88&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibtoSXwZTWAhXj24MKHXqdC-0Q6AEITTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Henri%20Boudon&amp;f=false "Henri-Marie Boudon", ''The Messenger of the sacred heart of Jesus", Apostleship of prayer, 1881, p. 132]&lt;/ref&gt; Boudon served as Archdeacon of [[Evreux]]&lt;ref name=CR&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SgIFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=Henri+Boudon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1NMBIqUvKo&amp;sig=TTvdZoFp6sZ5PavCLDgrdzCrs7g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibtoSXwZTWAhXj24MKHXqdC-0Q6AEISjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Henri%20Boudon&amp;f=false "Catholic Review's Review of Thompson's "The Life of Henri-Marie Boudon", '' 'The Month' and Catholic Review' '', 1881]&lt;/ref&gt; and given with the authority of Vicar-General. During his visitations to various ecclesiastical sites, the Archdeacon was particularly dismayed at the deplorable conditions he found in many domestic chapels of the chateaux of the privileged. His criticism was not well-received and made many enemies, as did his efforts to reform  a disinterested and self-indulgent clergy. 

Boudon was a key figure in the [[French school of spirituality]]. A recurring theme in Boudon's work, characteristic of the French school, was the idea that the search for God requires detachment from all creatures. "God Alone"&lt;ref name=life&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BHYBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=henri+boudon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sgVBKJhaMC&amp;sig=LVSkuo0fUanOc8M3ICUaL2f2imc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwjazY14DMAhVMGD4KHeiyA_Q4ChDoAQhDMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=henri%20boudon&amp;f=false ''The life of Henri-Marie Boudon'', (Edward Healy Thompson, ed.)

'''Jan Standonck''' (or ''Jean Standonk''; 16 August 1453 – 5 February 1504) was a [[Burgundian Netherlands|Flemish]] [[priest]], [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]], and [[reform movement|reformer]].

He was part of the great movement for reform in the 15th-century French church. His approach was to reform the recruitment and education of the [[clergy]], along very [[ascetic]] lines, heavily influenced by [[Francis of Paola|the hermit saint Francis of Paola]]. To this end he founded many [[colleges]], all of them strictly controlled and dedicated to poor students with real vocations. Chief amongst them was the [[Collège de Montaigu]], latterly part of the [[University of Paris]]. He lived at a time when this model of reform was under increasing pressure from more thoroughgoing critiques—including that of one of his most famous students, [[Erasmus]].

==Early years==
He was born in [[Mechelen]] (at that time part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]]) into extremely humble circumstances, the son of a poor [[shoemaking|cobbler]]. He received his early education there but quickly transferred to [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], where the [[Brothers of the Common Life]] ran a famous school along [[monastic]] lines. Here Jan developed his preference for a [[mystical]], as opposed to an intellectual, approach to religion, together with a determinedly [[ascetic]] approach to religious life. The education he received from the [[Brothers of the Common Life|Brothers]] was a traditional [[Medieval]] one, including [[Grammar]] and [[Logic]], conducted during long days, interrupted by religious devotions, and accompanied by frugal meals, cold beds and many punishments. However, the ancient writers were not neglected—[[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Horace]], [[Cicero]] and [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] were much studied with a view to producing a good [[Latin]] style and many [[moral]] messages. But he was warned against the views of these [[Paganism|pagan]] authors, to counterbalance which he studied the [[Bible]] and the [[Church Fathers]]. In particular, he studied the [[Devotio Moderna]]; a mystical approach based on [[Thomas a Kempis|Thomas a Kempis's]] [[Imitation of Christ]]—in particular, imitation of his sufferings. Jan paid for his studies, as many poor boys did, by serving in the kitchen, or attending to richer students, and performing menial tasks, such as ringing the bell. According to the anonymous monk who was his first biographer (1519), he could not afford candles, so he read, after a hard day, high up in the bell tower by the light of the moon. He never managed to develop a good Latin style—it was apparently always rough and full of mistakes—and he knew nothing of the Greek that was kindling the enthusiasm of so many of his contemporaries, but he never lost his love of the severe religious life learned at [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]].

On 22 November 1469 he enrolled at [[Old University of Louvain|Leuven University]] but seems to have moved on to Paris very soon afterwards. Here he again performed menial services—this time for the monks of [[Abbey of St Genevieve|Sainte Genevieve]]—in return for his education. He got his degree in 1475. He was immediately asked to become [[Regent]]—that is, student-master—in the [[Collège de Montaigu]], where he also began his (more advanced) studies in [[Theology]]. Soon afterwards, he visited a renowned Italian [[hermit]] who had been invited to France by the King, [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]]. This was [[Francis of Paola|St Francis of Paola]], who had given up all possessions, (he had walked to France from Italy), including the personal use of money, and subjected himself to severe privations in terms of food, clothing, cleanliness, heat and bedding. Jan was tremendously struck by Francis's air of saintliness.

==Collège de Montaigu==
On 30 May 1483, he became Master of the [[Collège de Montaigu]], a home for poor students from far away. The College had been founded in 1314 by [[Gilles I Aycelin de Montaigu|Gilles Aycelin]],&lt;ref&gt;Otherwise [[Gilles Aycelin]] (the elder), [[Gilles Asselin]] de Montaigu, or Montaigut.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Normandy]], France—who was the [[Archbishop of Rouen]] from 1311 to 1319). Later that year, he was also made the librarian for the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], the famous Theology Faculty of the [[University of Paris]].

The College was in great disrepair when Jan Standonck took over—some of the walls were falling down. It had become known as the Collège de Montaigu, after the Archbishop's brother, and Jan was to make it famous. He imposed a very severe regime on the students. They could leave only with his permission and had to return before nightfall—he took the key from the porter every night. They wore only a single cloth gown and were given only a piece of bread each day to eat. They had to go to the door of a nearby monastery at eleven o'clock each morning to receive a hand-out of food. They were punished for the slightest fault, and were encouraged—out of pure charity—to inform of any misdemeanours, and to criticise each other's conduct. [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]], one of the students, later said he did not think anyone could forget—or even survive unscathed—their time at the College.

On 16 December 1485, Standonck was elected [[Rector (education)|Rector]] of the University. The students rose up in violent protest, such was his reputation for severity and strictness. (On 10 April 1490 he made a formal complaint to the authorities that students were not attending his lectures).

==Reform of the clergy==

In 1490 he received his [[Doctorate]] in [[Theology]], though he never made any original contribution to Theology. He just was not interested in this abstract speculation. Indeed, in the [[disputation]]s that he is recorded as having carried out, with other University Doctors, he always comes off second best. He was more interested in the practical means of salvation—in his terms, a return to poverty and complete self-denial—and these he preached, in a Flemish accent, but in powerful French. He followed the rule of Francis of Paola very strictly and preached that all priests and monks should do so too. By 1493, there were 80 students at the College. They only left when they went to a monastery or to become a parish priest. Standonck hoped by this means to reform the church. In the same year, the King had set up a Commission to examine abuses in the church and he was asked to give a lecture to them, which he did on 12 November at [[Tours]]. In this he set out a long list of demands. Most of these were familiar to church reformers—only fit and proper persons should be priests, there should be no money charged for their services, or for accepting a post. There should be free election (by fit and proper priests) of their [[bishop]]s, or monks of their [[abbot]]s, and all other religious positions (including teachers at the University). He added demands that the priests and monks should lead exemplary lives. This meant his by now well known strictly ascetic life—including enforcing [[celibacy]] among the clergy.

Meanwhile, his reputation for saintliness was growing. He was made a [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of [[Beauvais]] on 11 November 1493. In the following year, he asked the monks of [[Chartreux]] to oversee the spiritual welfare of his college, which he had set on a firmer footing, with regular rules, approved by the [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]] of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]. The [[Admiral of France]], [[Louis Malet de Graville]] gave him a property which brought in 120 livres a year, which he used for the College. The Admiral also paid for a new building. He got another gift to the same value the following year from [[Jean de Rochechouart]], which he dedicated to the college. When he preached at St Georges at Abbéville during [[Lent]] in 1496, the only payment he asked for was some black and grey cloth to clothe his students.

In 1498, king [[Manuel I of Portugal]] complained officially to France for the sale of Portuguese merchandise taken by French corsairs via Admiral Graville.&lt;ref name=LACH&gt;{{cite book|last=LACH|first=Donald F.|title=Asia in the making of Europe: Volume II, A century of wonder|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-46733-3|pages=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhE3sPY78s0C&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Andre%20de%20Gouveia&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q=Andre%20de%20Gouveia&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; To appease the king, Standonck offered two scholarships for worthy Portuguese students in the college.&lt;ref name=PELLERIN&gt;{{cite book|last=PELLERIN|first=Agnès, Anne Lima, Xavier de Castro|title=Les Portugais à Paris: au fil des siècles &amp; des arrondissements|year=2009|publisher=Editions Chandeigne|location=France|isbn=2-915540-35-7|pages=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=plnvNYZEAsgC&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=Jan%20Standonck%20ManuelI&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king accepted, becoming a benefactor of Collège de Montaigu, sending [[Diogo de Gouveia]] to study there in 1499.

==Reform spreads==
His message of a reformed clergy was in great demand (though he had to call for armed help from the Admiral's men to evict an [[Augustinian]] friar from the pulpit at [[Abbéville]]). Later that year he tried to bring a [[Heresy|heretic]] to see the error of his ways. [[Jean Langlois]] was a priest who had travelled widely—in Spain, [[Provence]], Italy and [[Bohemia]] where he had picked up some dangerous ideas. On 3 June 1496 he pushed the priest serving [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] at [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] and scattered the [[Host (Holy Communion)|Host]]s from the [[chalice (cup)|chalice]] before stamping all over them and declaring the idea of the [[real presence]] of [[Christ]] in them to be a [[superstition]]. He was also a brother of one of Standonck's students, so Jan visited him in prison to try to get him to repent, which  he did. However, when he learned he was to be handed over to the civil authorities—to be put to death—he retracted his repentance. He was ceremoniously stripped of his priesthood in front of Notre Dame, and the public executioner chopped off the hand that had offensively touched the sacred chalice. He was then put backwards on a donkey and led to the pig market to be burned. Standonck followed him all the way, preaching and imploring him to repent until he was so exhausted he could not speak. Langlois repented just as he was being burned. Standonck declared that from henceforth he would maintain a strict [[Lenten]] [[fasting|fast]].

The demands for his services were so much that he had to go for help to the [[Brothers of the Common Life]] of [[Congregation of Windesheim|Windesheim]] in the [[Netherlands]], who agreed to send him six priests, led by [[Jean de Bruxelles]], and including an interpreter. These, along with Montaigu graduates, he sent to monasteries and bishops who asked for help in reforming their priests. They would work by setting an example of a strict ascetic life of prayer and devotion. Many monks began to suspect some order of take-over. Still others began resenting the suggestion they did not know how to live a holy life, while still others felt that Standonck's approach was too extreme. He had mixed success, and the Dutch brothers returned home. He won some powerful enemies in several prestigious [[convent]]s, including [[St. Victor's Abbey, Marseille|St Victor.]]

==Opposition grows==
On 27 October 1496, the Chapter of Notre Dame Cathedral ordered all the priests in the [[diocese]] to give up any women they were living with. There was violent opposition to this. The following year he got one vote in the election for [[Archbishop of Rheims]] and Jan was persuaded to use this as a challenge to the dubious methods used by the winner, the candidate of the King. Charles VIII had died and the new king, [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] was crowned by the new archbishop at [[Rheims Cathedral]] on 17 December 1498. To consolidate his position, Louis divorced his wife, [[Joan of France, Duchess of Berry|Jeanne]], and married the widow, [[Anne of Brittany|Queen Anne]], of the late King, who had been his nephew. Jan unwisely advised the Queen against the marriage and preached against divorce (except in cases of adultery). Early the following year, he, along with the other Doctors in the University went on strike in protest against what they saw as unlawful interference in their affairs by the King. He was prominent in setting out their case. He also helped one of the more forceful opponents of the divorce escape. The King got his divorce and set about punishing his opponents. Standonck was lucky to get only two years exile. He handed over direction of the College to [[Noël Béda]] and [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]] and set off to [[Cambrai]] in his native Flanders, where he was welcomed by the Bishop.

==Last years==
He used the time in exile to continue preaching and he founded schools, based on the rule of the [[Collège de Montaigu]] in various towns, including his hometown of [[Mechlin]], [[Breda]] and his old [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]]. Later he founded one at [[Beauvais]], where he was canon of the [[Cathedral of Beauvais|Cathedral]]. In [[Brussels]] he preached to the [[Philip I of Castile|Archduke Philip of Austria]] and he visited the [[Brothers of the Common Life|Brothers]] at [[Congregation of Windesheim|Windesheim]] and [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]]. Louis XII, under pressure, relented in 1500, signing very fulsome testimonial on 17 April. On 21 August that year, [[Pope Alexander VI]] formally agreed to the rules Standonck had set out for his colleges and the following year, he set out to visit new ones at [[Valenciennes]], [[Leyden]] and [[Harlem]], as well as re-[[Mechlin]]. In 1502, he received one vote for the [[Bishopric of Paris]], but wisely did not follow this up. He tried to convert another [[Heresy|heretic]], but this time he failed, but he had not lost his typically medieval taste for litigation. In 1503, he took one of the College masters ([[Jacques Almain]]) to court for leaving, taking some students with him. They were ordered to return. He later fell ill with a fever, so bad that the doctors insisted he take some meat, which he did. He echoed St Francis of Assis in welcoming the fever bouts with "Welcome, Sister Fever!". He recovered a little but had a relapse in early 1504. He died during the night of 4 and 5 February, aged 50, and was immediately buried without ceremony at the door of the chapel, so that people could walk over his grave. The inscription was "Souvenez-vous du pauvre homme Standonck"—remember the poor man, Standonck.

==Influence==
There is no doubting the tremendous influence of Standonck at the time and the college founded was for centuries one of the most prestigious in the world, producing scholars and ardent reformers of all camps, including Béda, John Mair, Erasmus and later [[John Calvin|Calvin]] and [[Ignatius of Loyola|Loyola]]. His form of reform—the education of exemplary clergy—was taken over in the [[Catholic Reformation]] but was rejected by the more radical reform demanded by [[Martin Luther|Luther]], Calvin and [[John Knox|Knox]], for whom personal mortification rather missed the point. The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] reformer Erasmus agreed. His judgement on Jan Standonk was that his intentions were good, but he lacked judgement. Erasmus's own judgement on the Collège de Montaigu was brutal indeed. Others—John Mair, for example—looked back on it with immense gratitude and respect.

== Biography ==
Janina Hosiasson ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Hosiassonóawa'')  was born on 6 December 1899 in Warsaw, the daughter of the merchant Josef Hosiasson and his wife Sophia Feigenblat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://szukajwarchiwach.pl/72/200/0/-/126/skan/full/ucIIlcq3FqfFhN1eaOExyw Birth record of Yanina Hosiasson]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was a student of [[Tadeusz Kotarbinski]] and [[Jan Łukasiewicz]].at the [[University of Warsaw]].and received her doctorate there under Kotarbinski in 1926&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with a dissertation on the "Justification of Inductive Reasoning".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She then became a secondary school teacher.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/888074959|title=Alfred Tarski : early work in Poland : geometry and teaching|last=|first=|publisher=|others=McFarland, Andrew,, McFarland, Joanna,, Smith, James T.,|year=|isbn=9781493914746|location=New York|pages=335|chapter=p.335|oclc=888074959|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=olNDBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA335&amp;lpg=PA335&amp;dq=Janina+Hosiasson-Lindenbaumowa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=00sf33g_9K&amp;sig=Z8qX0st99XaNMWjyHOKiDHEztvY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit26G8w8vZAhWFBcAKHbcVCcgQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1920's she was a respected philosopher of logic of the [[Lwow-Warsaw school|Lwow-Warsaw]] school who actively participated in the second Polish Philosophical Congress held in Warsaw in September 1927 and (like her husband-to-be) delivered papers at the First Congress of Mathematicians from Slavic Countries&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; held in Warsaw and [[Poznań]] in September 1929&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Janina then went, on a scholarship from the Polish Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education, to spend the 1929/30 academic year studying philosophy in Cambridge&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;..

According to Zygmunt and Purdy "in late 1935, or (more likely) sometime in the first 7 or 8 months of 1936" Janina Hosiasson married mathematician and fellow logician [[Adolf Lindenbaum]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After marriage Janina would use the surname Hosiasson-Lindenbaum.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The couple then resided together in [[Żoliborz|Zoliborz]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Janina had focused her research primarily on induction and the application of probability theory to inductive logic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Hosiasson-Lindenbaum is listed amongst the speakers at the first Unity of Science Congress in Paris 1935&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326589082_Wrongful_life_reloaded_Logical_empiricism's_philosophy_of_biology_1934-1936_PragueParisCopenhagen_With_historical_and_political_intermezzos_2018|title="Wrongful life" reloaded: Logical empiricism's philosophy of biology 1934-1936 (Prague/Paris/Copenhagen): With historical and political intermezzos (2018)|last=Wolters|first=Gereon|date=|website=ResearchGate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is known to have participated in the preliminary meeting for the same in Prague the previous year and to have attended the Second Congress held in Copenhagen in 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NEztCAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Vienna+Circle+and+the+Lvov-+Warsaw+School+edited+by+A_+Szaniawski&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP2aKfkereAhWOXMAKHcpEAnMQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Janina%20Hosiasson&amp;f=false|title=The Vienna Circle and the Lvov-Warsaw School|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Szaniawski|editor-first=Klemens|location=|pages=1, 444}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  She had (like [[Alfred Tarski]]) also been scheduled to present her research at the Unity of Science Congress at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in September 1939 but, fatefully, was unable to sail in time&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; - she applied for passage on the next boat to America after that taken by Tarski but her visa was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54691904|title=Alfred Tarski : life and logic|last=Burdman.|first=Feferman, Anita|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Feferman, Solomon.|year=|isbn=9780521802406|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=108|oclc=54691904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of World War II, on 6 September 1939, the couple moved to [[Vilnius]] (a city then in Poland - known as Wilno - that was annexed by the Soviet Union) but there separated with Adolf continuing on to [[Białystok|Bialystok]] (it is unknown whether they saw each other after this). On 22 June 22, 1941, Germany declared war on the Soviet Union.Within days, German troops had entered Bialystok and, soon after, Vilnius. Around September, 1941 her husband was arrested in Bialystok.and it is generally thought (again, according to Zygmunt and Purdy) that he was killed by the Nazis that same year. Janina was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and in April, 1942, after 7 months of imprisonment in Vilnius, she was transported to [[Paneriai]], on the outskirts of the city, and shot.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Jesse Ndwiga Kanyua Mugambi''' (born 6 February 1947) is a professor of philosophy and religious studies at the [[University of Nairobi]] with professional training in [[pedagogy|education]] and [[philosophy of religion]]. His academic specializations include [[philosophy]], [[theology]] and [[religious studies]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Mugambi was born on 6 February 1947 at Kiangoci, [[Embu District]], in the Eastern Province of [[Kenya]]. Mugambi's father Timothy Kanyua Mugambi and mother Jemimah Koori were both committed [[Anglican]] Christians. His father, whom he describes as a person who was "ahead of his time," was a lay leader, preacher and evangelist.&lt;ref name="Gathogo" /&gt;

Mugambi also spent much of his childhood with his paternal grandfather Mugambi wa Nthigai, an elder statesman who arbitrated over disputes and provided advice and counsel to many people who came to consult him, and his paternal grandmother Rhoda Wambiro. Mugambi's maternal grandfather was Daniel Njerü wa Kanyenje, who had served in the Carrier Corps in the then [[Tanganyika]] during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="Gathogo" /&gt;

Both sets of his grandparents were strict adherents of their African cultural and religious heritage. While his parents nurtured him to become a strong Christian, his grandparents nurtured him to cherish the African heritage.

=== Education ===
Mugambi began his career as a high school teacher and a college tutor. After high school, he enrolled at Machakos Teacher Training College (MTTC), Kenya, in 1966–67. In 1968 he was admitted to [[Kenyatta College]], Nairobi, to pursue further teacher training for a year, specializing in religious education and English at the high school level. He would pursue further studies at [[Westhill College of Education]], [[Birmingham, UK]], and conducted historical research at the [[Church Missionary Society|CMS]] Archives in London (1969–70).&lt;ref name=Gathogo/&gt;

In 1971, Mugambi would attend the [[University of Nairobi]] for undergraduate and postgraduate studies.&lt;ref name=Gathogo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gathogo|first1=Julius|title=Jesse Mugambi's Pedigree: Formative Factors|url=http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/4407/Gathogo.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 he embarked on his research for PhD, which he completed in 1983, focusing on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] entitled "Problems of Meaning in Discourse with Reference to Religion."&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, "Problems of Meaning in Discourse with Reference to Religion", (Nairobi: PhD Thesis, University of Nairobi, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; His main supervisor was Professor Joseph Donders, with helpful advice from Professor [[Kwasi Wiredu]], who was then in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Ghana]], Legon.&lt;ref&gt;Kwasi Wiredu, Philosophy and an African Culture, Cambridge University Press, 1980; Cultural Universals and Particulars, Indiana University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he was invited to participate in an ecumenical research project to document the practice of ecumenism at the local level in eastern Africa. This research was published in 1982 as ''Ecumenical Initiatives in Eastern Africa''.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Mugambi, John Mutiso-Mbinda and Judith Vollbrecht, Ecumenical Initiatives in Eastern Africa, Nairobi: AACC/AMECEA, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early career ===
After graduation from the University of Nairobi, Mugambi would become active in the [[ecumenical movement]]. In 1970, when he participated in the formation and launch of the Christian Student Council (the Kenyan SCM) and in the National Association of Religious Education Teachers (NARET).&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, "African Christian Theology: A Reflection", in Salaam: Journal of the National Association of R.E. Teachers, Nairobi, April 1981 - Article.&lt;/ref&gt; These involvements brought him into acquaintance with other ecumenists. He would later serve as Africa Theology Secretary for the [[World Student Christian Federation]] (1974–76), and remained a resource person in various ecumenical organizations at local, national, regional, continental and global levels. He would also hold various posts in the [[World Council of Churches]] from 1975 until today.

Mugambi joined the academic staff of the University of Nairobi in 1976, and rose through the ranks to full professorship in 1993. He has taught philosophy of religion; Religion and Science; Comparative Study of Religions; Contemporary Religious Thought; Modern Trends in Christian Thought. He has also taught [[African theology|African Christian Theology]]. Later on he began teaching Phenomenology of Religion in the postgraduate syllabus.

=== Honors ===
Mugambi has had a number of visiting professorships internationally.

He is a fellow of the [[Kenya National Academy of Sciences]] (FKNAS) and was conferred a national honour as an Edler of the [[Order of the Burning Spear]] (EBS) in 2010.

== Thoughts ==

Early in 1990 he became widely acclaimed in Christian theological circles after he addressed the General Committee of the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]] on March 30 in Nairobi, reflecting on "The Future of the Church and the Church of the Future in Africa."&lt;ref&gt;Mugambi's original Paper on the Theology of Reconstruction Paper was published in the book, The Church of Africa: Towards a Theology of Reconstruction, 1991:29-50, which Mugambi edited jointly with J.B Chipenda, A. Karamaga and C.K Omari. It also appears in his book, From liberation to reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War, (Nairobi: EAEP, 1995), 160-180 – as chapter ten.&lt;/ref&gt; This event was a few weeks after [[Nelson Mandela]] had been released on 11 February 1990 and [[Namibia]] had attained national independence on 21 March of the same year. In his address, Mugambi suggested that [[African Christianity]] must shift theological gear from the paradigm of liberation, which emphasised the [[The Exodus|Exodus motif]], to that of reconstruction, which emphasises the post-Exilic motif. He later elaborated this insight in his book ''From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War''.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, From liberation to reconstruction: African Christian theology after the cold war, (Nairobi: EAEP, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[doctoral thesis]], completed in 1984 at the University of Nairobi, was on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], focusing on problems of meaning in discourse with reference to religion. His professional training is in education, communication and university management. His honorary service has been mainly the [[ecumenical movement]] at the local, national, regional, continental and global levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?di=173302, Hope For the Future: The Uppsala Interfaith Climate Manifesto—Faith Traditions Addressing Global Warming.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hermeneutics ===
Mugambi is Africa Co-Editor of ''Cambridge Dictionary of Christianity'', in which he has contributed more than ten articles, mainly on [[Biblical hermeneutics|hermeneutics]].&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, Co-Editor, Cambridge Dictionary of Christianity, New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010, General Editor Daniel Patte (forthcoming). Contributor of thirteen Articles:  "i) Anglicanism in Eastern and Western Africa; ii) Berlin Conference; iii) Charismatic Movements in Southern Africa; iv) Church, Types of Ecclesiastical Structures; v) Culture and Christianity; vi) Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians (EATWOT); vii) Kenya; viii) Krapf, Johann Ludwig; ix) Liberia; x) Racism and Christianity in Africa; xi) Rebmann, Johannes (1820-1876); xii) Reconstruction, African Theologies of; xiii) Theological Education in Africa: Issues It Faces."&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral research on Ludwig Wittgenstein anchored him into hermeneutical thinking.  Wittgenstein observed that philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language. Hermeneutics deals with principles of interpretation. Within the context of Christian Theology, most doctrinal conflicts are the result of misunderstandings about biblical texts, historical claims and cultural assumptions.

In 1998, Mugambi observed that the time was overdue for African Christian theologians to engage in theological introspection, transcending ecclesiological description and theological anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, "A Critique of Method in African Christian Theology" in J.M. Waliggo and Mary Getui, eds., Worship in African Christianity, Nairobi: Acton, 1998 (chapter).&lt;/ref&gt; He cited [[Bernard Lonergan]] as a possible role model in that approach.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lonergan, Method in Theology, New York: Herder and Herder, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Knut Holter of the School of Theology in Stavanger, Norway facilitated in Nairobi a continental Conference of African Old Testament scholars, which Mugambi was invited to address. The topic of his paper was  "Africa and the Old Testament", published in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, "Africa and the Old Testament', in Mary Getui, Knut Holter and Victor Zinkuratire, eds., Interpreting the Old Testament in Africa, Nairobi: Acton, 2001. Chapter&lt;/ref&gt; The Society for New Testament Studies (SNTS) held its Annual Conference for 1999 at the [[University of Pretoria]], South Africa. Following that Conference some African Christian theologians were invited to present papers on Hermeneutics at a meeting in Hammanskraal, near Pretoria. Mugambi delivered the Keynote Address titled "Foundations for an African Approach to Biblical Hermeneutics", which was published in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, "Foundations for an African Approach to Biblical Hermeneutics" in Mary N. Getui, Tinyiko Maluleke and Justin Ukpong, eds., Interpreting the New Testament in Africa, Nairobi: Acton, 2001. Chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the respondents to his address were Professor Hans-Dieter Betz (University of Chicago);&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Dieter Betz, "Remarks of the SNTS President", in Mary N. Getui, Tinyiko Maluleke and Justin Ukpong, eds, Interpreting the New Testament in Africa, pp. 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Peder Borgen (University of Trondheim)&lt;ref&gt;Peder Borgen, "A Necessary and Important Step", in Mary N. Getui, Tinyiko Maluleke and Justin Ukpong, eds, Interpreting the New Testament in Africa, pp. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; and Professor Vernon Robbins (Emory University).&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Robbins, "Why Participate in African Biblical Interpretation?" in Mary N. Getui, Tinyiko Maluleke and Justin Ukpong, eds, Interpreting the New Testament in Africa, pp. 275-291.&lt;/ref&gt; The Report of this "Unique Conference" was written and presented by Professor Bernard Lategan (Stellenbosch University).&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lategan, "African Hermeneutics and Theology: Report on a Unique Conference", in Mary N. Getui, Tinyiko Maluleke and Justin Ukpong, eds, Interpreting the New Testament in Africa, pp. 292-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Mugambi co-edited a book on New Testament Hermeneutics, to which he contributed a Chapter.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, 'Challenges to African Scholars in Biblical Hermeneutics' in J.N.K. Mugambi and Johannes Smit, eds, Text and Context in New Testament Hermeneutics, Nairobi: Acton. (chapter).&lt;/ref&gt; The following year a conference was held at Makerere University, which Mugambi was invited to address. His paper was "African Hermeneutics in a Global Context", published in 2007 as a Chapter in Interpreting Classical Religious Texts in Contemporary Africa, edited by Knut Holter.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, "African Hermeneutics in a Global Context", in Interpreting Classical Religious Texts in Contemporary Africa, edited by Knut Holter, Nairobi: Acton, 2007, Chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; There is much hermeneutical discourse in Mugambis book (co-authored with Michael R. Guy) titled Contextual Theology Across Cultures, published in 2009.

Mugambi is critical of [[Rudolf Bultmann]]'s project of "[[demythologisation]]", on the ground that hermeneutically, [[myth]] cannot be abstracted from the Gospel. Any attempt at 'demythologization' results in new myths. Instead of "demythologization", Mugambi urges for "remythologization." He says of Bultmann, "in (his) attempt to satisfy scientific positivism by denouncing myth (he) ends up destroying the reality of religion as a pillar of culture."&lt;ref name="reconstruction1"&gt;J. N. K Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: 37.&lt;/ref&gt; For Mugambi, as with Jaspers, "myth is indispensable in cultural constructions of reality."&lt;ref name="reconstruction1"/&gt; To Mugambi, therefore, reconstruction in Africa has to be anchored in a) the formulation of new myths to replace the negative stereotypes used for the indoctrination of Africans under imperialism and missionary tutelage, and b) re-interpreting the old myths, for the survival of the African peoples. He suggests that the myth of "a vanishing people must be replaced by the myth of a resurgent, or resilient people," while the myth of a "desperate people must be replaced by the myth of a people (who are) full of hope. The myth of a hungry people must be replaced by the myth of a people capable of feeding themselves, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;J. N. K Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Missiology ===
In 1989 Mugambi published his book The Biblical Basis for Evangelization.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, The Biblical Basis for Evangelization, Nairobi: Oxford University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; This was in same year that he facilitated the editing and publication of a collection of essays on this theme – Christian Mission and Social Transformation.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, ed., Christian Mission and Social Transformation, Nairobi: NCCK, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; This book was published in the context of the Mission Conference convened by the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) in commemoration of the seventieth anniversary of the Kikuyu Conference of 1918 which launched ecumenical cooperation in Kenya. In 1996 he published an Article titled "African Churches in Social Transformation" in the Journal International Affairs at Columbia University, New York.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, "African Churches in Social Transformation"  in Journal of International Affairs, Vol. 50 No. 1, Columbia University, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This article was followed by another titled "Vision of African Church in Mission", published in Missionalia, Journal of the Southern African Missiological Society.

In 1998 he published Missiological Research in the Context of Globalization in "Missiological Research in the Context of Globalization", in Swedish Missiological Themes, Uppsala.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, "Missiological Research in the Context of Globalization", in Swedish Missiological Themes, Vol. 86, No. 4, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; He also published "A Fresh Look at Evangelism in Africa" in International Review of Mission, Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, "Christian Mission and Social Transformation After the Cold War" in Journal of Constructive Theology, Vol. 4 No. 2, December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he published "Christian Mission and Social Transformation After the Cold War" in the Journal of Constructive Theology, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. At the request of Bishop John V. Taylor in 2001, Mugambi wrote a critical Introduction published in the second edition of Taylor's book, ''The Primal Vision'' (SCM Press), also published in Nairobi as ''Christian Presence amid African Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, "Introduction" in J.V. Taylor, Primal Vision, London: SCM, 2001, also published as Christian Presence amid African Religion, Nairobi: Acton, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eco-theology ===

During a conference organized by the World Council of Churches Sub-Unit of Church and Society in July 1986 at Potsdam, East Germany, Mugambi presented a position paper titled "God, Humanity and Nature in Ecumenical Discussion" cautioning against too sharp a distinction between these three notions in Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, "God, Humanity and Nature in Ecumenical Discussion", in Church and Society Report, Potsdam, July 1986, Geneva, 1986 - Position Paper.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 he published his book ''God, Humanity and Nature in Relation to Justice and Peace''.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, God, Humanity and Nature in Relation to Justice and Peace, Geneva: WCC, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; He intended this book to be a contribution to discussions within the World Council of Churches concerning the relationship between Religion and Culture on the one hand, and God and Nature on the other. This publication was an echo of a public forum which Mugambi had organized as an undergraduate at the University of Nairobi in 1972, with Professor Stephen Neill as Patron, on the theme "Creation or Evolution: God or Darwin". The theme of Ecology became one of his research interests, and in 2001 he facilitated the editing and publication of ''Christian Theology and Environmental Responsibility''.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi and Mika Vähäkangas, eds., Christian Theology and Environmental Responsibility, Nairobi: Acton, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; His contribution in that book was a Chapter highly critical of Carbon Dioxide Emissions Trading, which was being pushed for adoption within the Kyoto Protocol under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).&lt;ref&gt;"Emissions Trading as an Aspect of Toxic Waste Dumping", in J.N.K. Mugambi and Mika Vahakangas, eds., Nairobi: Acton, 2001.Co-editor with Mika Vahakangas, Christian Theology and Environmental Responsibility, Nairobi: Acton, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 he published his reflections on "Some Lessons from a Century of Ecumenism in Africa."&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, "Some Lessons from a Century of Ecumenism in Africa" in Efiong Utuk, Visions of Authenticity: The Assemblies of the AACC 1963-1992, Nairobi: AACC, 1997 (chapter).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he co-authored with Gaim Kebreab a reference book titled ''Fresh Water to Eradicate Poverty'', released in Oslo by Norwegian Church Aid.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi and Gaim Kebreab, Fresh Water to Eradicate Poverty, Norwegian Church Aid, 2004 .&lt;/ref&gt; The World Council of Churches has Observer status in the United Nations. The Twelfth UNFCCC Conference of Parties was convened at Nairobi, Kenya, in December 2006. Mugambi served as honorary Moderator of the Ecumenical Team as a member of the WCC Delegation. The ecumenical viewpoint was widely publicized in the print and electronic media. Mugambi read the WCC Statement at COP 12 in Nairobi.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, 2006, www.un.org/webcast/unfccc/2006/high_level_segment.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Mugambi was invited to participate in an ecumenical Consultation to discuss the theme "Peace on Earth and Peace with the Earth". He presented a paper titled "The Environmental Crisis from an African Perspective."&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, "The Environmental Crisis from an African Perspective," in Geiko Müller-Fahrenholz, ed., Peace on Earth and Peace with the Earth, Geneva: John Knox International Reformed Centre, pp. 77-83.&lt;/ref&gt; He also published an Article titled "The Environmental Crisis from a Christian Perspective."&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, 'The Environmental Crisis from a Christian Perspective', in Wajibu: Journal of Social Concern, Vol. 23 No. 3, pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Fifteenth UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP 15) at Copenhagen in December 2009 Mugambi as a member of the WCC Delegation participated in a Seminar arranged by Dan Church Aid and hosted by the Faculty of Theology at Copenhagen University. The Title of his presentation was "Adaptation to Climate Change in Tropical Africa".&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, 2009, www.gronkirke.dk/fileadmin/.../MUGAMBI_ON_ADAPTATION.pdf; www.oikoumene.org/en/news/.../how-theology-can-help-sav.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied ecology===

Mugambi emphasizes that our survival as human beings across generations will depend on how we manage our ecology – the flora and fauna in all the habitats where human beings have their abode. The availability of fresh water determines the habitability of an environment. Most of the land on the continent of Africa has arable soils, but freshwater is very unevenly distributed. Fresh water can be obtained from rivers, fresh-water lakes and underground aquifers. The most cost-effective source of fresh water is rainwater harvesting. In his book Fresh Water to Eradicate Poverty he observes that Africa has the largest quantity of stable rainwater runoff, which may be harvested season after season, accumulating huge quantities to be used for agricultural, domestic and industrial applications. Rainwater harvesting can also help to recharge the rivers, lakes and underground aquifers. As a practicing ecologist, Professor Mugambi is a trustee of the Kenya Rainwater Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gharainwater.org/kra_about.html Kenya Rainwater Association : Members]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Utooni Development organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utoonidevelopment.org/index.php?page=contact-us Contact Us &amp;#124; Eco-Metro Development]&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a member of the Ecumenical Water Network&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oikoumene.org/en/activities/ewn-home.html Ecumenical Water Network EWN]&lt;/ref&gt; and the World Council of Churches Working Group on Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oikoumene.org/programmes/justice-diakonia-and-responsibility-for-creation/climate-change-and-water.html Climate change and water]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of [[Global Warming]] there are unpredictable extremes every season in all regions, making survival difficult for communities that depend on seasonal rains for agriculture and staple food. The droughts are longer and more severe. The rains when they come are heavier and for shorter periods, making it difficult for crops to grow to maturity. The regularity of the seasons can no longer be taken for granted. Rehabilitation of local environments is a necessity rather than a luxury for all regions. Jesse Mugambi has worked with communities in various African countries to promote awareness about the global ecological crisis.&lt;ref name="responsibility2001"&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi and Mika Vähäkangas, ed., Christian Theology and Environmental Responsibility, Nairobi: Acton, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inter-religious dialogue ===

Mugambi suggests that [[inter-religious dialogue]] has broader implications than arguments about beliefs and practices within and between religions. Believers of particular religions, denominations and sects are at the same time citizens of particular nations. Thus religious identity and secular identity are practical necessity, irrespective of idealistic and utopian expectations. During and after the European Reformation the rulers of specific nations interpreted religious non-conformism as subversion, while conformism facilitated the establishment of national churches that remain a legacy of European nationalism till the twenty-first century. In his view, inter-religious dialogue can be one of the means to promote mutual understanding within and between religions, cultures and nations, provided that such dialogue presupposes mutual respect and mutual reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, "Prerequisites for an Effective Dialogue involving Religion and Culture", in Ariane Hentsch Cisneros and Shanta Pramawardhana, eds, Sharing Values: A Hermeneutics for Global Ethics, Geneva: Globethics,net, 2010, pp. 249-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberation theology ===

According to Rosberg and Nottingham about 75,000 Kenyans served in the British military during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Rosberg and J. Nottingham, The Myth of Mau Mau: Nationalism in Colonial Kenya (Stanford, 1966), 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Some went to Asia (mainly Ceylon, India and Burma), including Mugambi's father. The [[Indian independence movement|struggle for national sovereignty in India]] was towards its end as the Kenyan veterans were returning home. Their [[military conscription|conscription]] into the war had been justified with the argument that Britain was fighting against tyranny in order to preserve democracy and freedom, which these veterans and the people they left at home did not enjoy. Upon their return, much more exposed and more self-confident than the peers who had not gone to war, these veterans led the campaign for national independence. The campaign was peaceful at the beginning, but the British administrators and settlers were adamant that Kenya would remain British for ever. The veterans found no justification for [[colonialism|colonial domination]] with its attendant alienation of ancestral lands by British settlers, [[economic exploitation]], forced labour, [[taxation without representation]], restriction of movement in their own country, [[racial segregation]], denial of access to basic social services including schooling and medical care.

The British [[missionaries]], settlers, administrators and [[entrepreneurs]] enjoyed full imperial [[citizenship]], while Kenyans remained imperial subjects in their motherland. Mugambi started schooling as an Internally Displaced Person (IDP) in a concentration camp. Collective punishment was the fate of all the people of Central Kenya, young and old, men and women, disabled and able-bodied, healthy and sick, guilty and innocent. They were all locked up in concentration camps under strict curfew orders the cost of breach of which was death. The experience was traumatic, as described by Caroline Elkins, David Anderson and others.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Elkins, Britain's Gulag: The Brutal End of Empire in Kenya (London: Jonathan Cape, 2005); David Anderson, Histories of the Hanged: The Dirty War and the End of Empire in Kenya, New York: W.W. Norton, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all odds, Mugambi managed to proceed with school work and to pass all his examinations without having to repeat any year. His articulation of Liberation Theology in later years was anchored in his personal experience of imperial domination and colonial oppression. In 1989 he published a book containing his theological reflections under the title African Christian Theology: An Introduction.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, African Christian Theology: An Introduction, Nairobi: Heinemann, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson Mandela in 1953 had aptly expressed the plight of Kenyans and the responsibility of Britain for their suffering, which he related with the situation in South Africa at the time:

The massacre of the Kenyan people by Britain has aroused worldwide indignation and protest. Children are being burnt alive; women are raped, tortured, whipped and boiling water poured on their breasts to force confessions from them that Jomo Kenyatta had administered the Mau Mau oath to them. Men are being castrated and shot dead. In the Kikuyu country, the population has been completely wiped out in some villages&amp;nbsp;... We are prisoners in our own country because we dared to raise our voices against those horrible atrocities and because we expressed our solidarity with the cause of the Kenyan people. You can see that there is no easy walk to freedom anywhere, and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintops of our desires.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Mandela, Nelson Mandela: The Struggle is My Life (Bellville: Mayibuye Books, 1994), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1974 essay on liberation and salvation, Mugambi had clarified that within the African context of the 1960s and 1970s liberation (from oppression, exploitation and racial prejudice) was the main preoccupation for al responsible leaders.

That the fundamental concern of African Christian theology has been liberation-salvation has been manifested in the activities of many African Christians and the growth of more than six thousand "Independent" churches in the continent of Africa. Most African Christians have not felt it necessary to theorize about Christian Theology, because to them religious faith is practical living, expressed most effectively through experience, not through words. The time has come when it is necessary to analyze the premises of African Christian experience and study it in relation to that of peoples in other parts of the world. This systematic analysis and study, however, will be realistic and relevant as African Christian theology if Africans themselves will be the analysts and students of their own experience&amp;nbsp;... What is important to point out in this context is that while liberation both as a concept and as a historical struggle in Africa today takes on different emphasis in different parts of Africa, it must be the overarching goal – the historical project— out of which and for which an African Christian theology must emerge.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, African Christian Theology: An Introduction, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reconstruction theology ===

In Mugambi's scholarly work liberation precedes reconstruction in African Christian Theological reflection.&lt;ref&gt;The Following doctoral Theses have been written on Mugambi's Reconstruction Theology: Ian Ritchie, McGill University, 1992; Isaac T. Mwase, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, 1993; Stephen I. Munga, Lund University, 1998; Joern Henrik Olsen, Copenhagen University, 2000; J. Njoroge wa Ngugi, Catholic University of America, 2001; Valentin Dedji, Cambridge University, 2001; Diane B. Stinton, Edinburgh University, 20003; Elelwani B. Farisani, University of Natal Pietermaritzburg, 2003; George Fihavango, University of Erlangen, Germany, 2005, Julius Mutugi Gathogo, University Natal Pietermaritzburg, 2006; Sicily Mbura Muriithi, University of Kwazulu Natal, 2008; John Fischer, University of Western Cape, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his studies and in his research and writing, Mugambi has interacted with a wide range of scholars from the North Atlantic, Asia and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;The North Atlantic, Asian and Latin American scholars with whom Mugambi has interacted, both directly and indirectly, include: [[Rubem Alves]], [[Karl Barth]], [[Hans Dieter Betz]], [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], [[José Míguez Bonino]], [[Colin Brown (theologian)|Colin Brown]], [[Walter Brueggemann]], [[Emil Brunner]], [[Rudolf Bultmann]], [[James H. Cone]], Frederick Copplestone, Joseph Donders, [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]], [[Enrique Dussel]], [[Gustavo Gutierrez]], Werner H. Kelber, [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Joseph Kitagawa]], [[Kosuke Koyama]], [[Karl Jaspers]], Geiko Muller-Fahrenholz, [[Stephen Neill]], [[Jurgen Moltmann]], [[Lesslie Newbigin]], [[H. Richard Niebuhr]], [[Daniel Patte]], [[John A.T. Robinson]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ninian Smart]], Choan Sen Song, [[Paul Tillich]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mugambi resonates with [[Karl Jaspers]]' positive appraisal of myth in the conceptualization of world-views. A myth tells a story and expresses intuitive insights, rather than universal concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jaspers, "Myth and Religion," in Ed. Hans-Werner Bartsch, ed., Kerygma and Myth: A Theological Debate, translated by Reginald Fuller (London: SPCK, 1972), 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Mugambi proposes that, "a society which is incapable of making its own myths and re-interpreting its old ones, becomes extinct."&lt;ref name="reconstruction1"/&gt; In view of this insight, Mugambi defines the vision of the theology of reconstruction, in Africa, as a project of  "...&amp;nbsp;re-mythologization, in which the theologian thus engaged, discerns new symbols and new metaphors in which to recast the central Message of the Gospel."&lt;ref&gt;J. N. K Mugambi, "The Bible and Ecumenism in African Christianity," in Hannah Kinoti and John Waliggo (eds) 1997. The Bible in African Christianity (Nairobi: Acton Publishers, 1997), 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mugambi joins other scholars in African Christian Theology, endeavouring to authentically relate Christianity with the African cultural and religious heritage with appreciation of both the Gospel and the wisdom bequeathed from generation to generation through oral tradition, cherished customs, rituals and symbols. It appears that Mugambi's concern for Pan-African identity has support within diplomatic circles. Even though he does not treat Africa as a single geo-cultural context of theology, he nevertheless creates in his readers an impression that African concerns are broadly the same – which is largely correct.&lt;ref&gt;Takatso A. Mofokeng, "Mission theology from an African perspective: A dialogue with David Bosch," in Kritzinger, J.N.K &amp; Saayman, W. A (eds.) 1990. Mission in creative tension: A dialogue with David Bosch (Pretoria: S.A Missiological society, 1990), 168-180.&lt;/ref&gt; He is particularly appealing because he strictly and consistently avoids any attempt at parochial, national and regional introversion, opting for an approach that keeps in full view the entire continent of Africa with all its homogeneity and heterogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K. Mugambi, African Christian Theology: An Introduction, pp. 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the risk of appearing too general in his books, Mugambi avoids using such particularistic titles as "South African Christianity," "Kenyan Christianity," "Africa North (or South) of Limpopo," "East African Christianity", etc. Rather, he is concerned with the Africans – both in the African continent and in the Diaspora. While Mugambi acknowledges that theological articulation is strictly contextual and situational, all his works take "Africa" as the "Context" rather than the artificial territorial identities that are the result of the Partition of Africa at the Berlin Conference of 1884–85.

Mugambi's book ''From Liberation to Reconstruction'' assesses events that affected Africa as a whole. These events include the end of the Cold War (1989), which divided African countries between those who were pro-West versus the pro-East - thereby causing unnecessary tensions among some neighbouring African countries. Other events include the release of Nelson Rholihlahla Mandela on 11 February 1990 after serving in prison for 27 years on [[Robben Island]]. For Mugambi, Mandela is not only the longest-serving political prisoner; he is also the most prominent symbol of the [[The Exodus|Exodus metaphor]] in African Christian Theology.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From a theology of liberation to a theology of reconstruction ===

In his post-Cold-War theological discourses, which can also be regarded as his post- liberation works, Mugambi suggests that the Africa of the 21st century will have to pre-occupy itself with the agenda of reconstruction as the new priority for Africa. The text of Ezra-Nehemiah, unlike that of the Exodus, has to be the main text in the explication of [[African theology|African theological discourses]] in the 21st century. This text will motivate the people of Africa to rebuild their continent from all sorts of ruins.

Reconstruction is the new priority for African nations in the 1990s (and beyond). The churches and their theologians will need to respond to this new priority in relevant fashion, to facilitate this process of reconstruction. The process will require considerable efforts of reconciliation and confidence-building. It will also require re-orientation and retraining.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.K Mugambi, "The Future of the church and the church of the future in Africa" in eds. J.B Chipenda, A. Karamaga, J.N.K Mugambi &amp; C.K Omari. The Church of Africa: Towards a Theology of Reconstruction (Nairobi: A.A.C.C, 1991), 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

While acknowledging that Mugambi has "correctly observed that an epiphany of a new scenario has emerged, ushered in by the demise of three horrendous systems of oppression; namely institutionalised racism, brutal colonialism and the cold war tutelage," Ukachukwu Chris Manus&lt;ref&gt;Ukachukwu Chris Manus, Intercultural Hermeneutics in Africa: Methods and Approaches (Nairobi: Acton, 2003), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; considers Mugambi as having failed to recognise the central figure in the New Testament, "Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ himself as the Master Reconstructor of both the spiritual and the social well-being of the bnaiya Israel, the simple folk of his day in first century Palestine."&lt;ref&gt;Ukachukwu Chris Manus, Intercultural hermeneutics in Africa: 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manus goes on to argue that the term "reconstruction" makes a deep impression on him as a "meta-language" that challenges African religiosity to discern and promote new insights that can inspire a new movement that would help to galvanise Africans in the continent like those in the Diaspora to struggle and regain their integrity.&lt;ref&gt;Ukachukwu Chris Manus, Intercultural hermeneutics in Africa: 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For Manus, therefore, the goal of reconstruction ought to be pursued in order to re-capture Africa's self-esteem, dignity and integrity, "in the context of new Information and Communication Technology."&lt;ref&gt;Ukachukwu Chris Manus, Intercultural hermeneutics in Africa: 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have offered perspectives on Mugambi's views on liberation and reconstruction. In attempting a definition, the late Hannah Wangeci Kinoti explained that the idea of reconstruction assumes that there is a framework which was previously there.

[[File:PortraitJNR.jpg|thumb|Julian Nida-Rümelin]]
'''Julian Nida-Rümelin''' (born November 28, 1954) is a German philosopher and public intellectual. He served as State Minister for Culture of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] under [[Chancellor Schröder]]. Currently, he is Professor of Philosophy and Political Theory at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]].

==Biography==
Nida-Rümelin studied Philosophy, Physics, Mathematics and Political Sciences. In 1984, he completed his PhD in Philosophy at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], where he obtained an assistant professorship, first at the Department of Philosophy and later at the Department of Political Sciences. In 1989, he was conferred the ''Habilitation'' (German post-doctoral qualification) from the Philosophy Department of [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]. After a one-year visiting professorship at [[Minnesota State University]], he was appointed Chair of the Center for Ethics in the Bio Sciences at [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen]]. From 1993 to 2003, he held a Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Göttingen]], before he became Chair of Political Theory and Philosophy at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]. Since 2009, he is Chair of Philosophy and Political Theory at the Department of Philosophy. He served as Dean of the Philosophy Faculty from 2009 until 2012 and as Deputy Dean thereafter. From 2011 until 2016, he was Speaker of the [[Munich Center for Ethics]].

Currently, he is Speaker of the executive study program ''Philosophy, Politics, and Ethics'' (PPE) and member of board of the Parmenides Foundation that is dedicated to fostering multi-disciplinary research on thinking at the interface of the natural sciences and humanities. He consults executives and senior managers in ethical questions due to his expertise on risk ethics and philosophy of economics, as revealed by his guiding position on the panel ''Finance and Ethics'' of the German Association of Financial Analyst and Asset Managers (DFAV e.V.) and his membership of the advisory board ''Intregity and Corporate Responsibility'' at Daimler AG.&lt;ref&gt;Nida-Rümelin, J, [http://www.julian.nida-ruemelin.de/category/publikationen/monographie/ Risikoethik] (The ethics of risk) with J. Schulenburg; B. Rath Berlin: de Gruyter, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nida-Rümelin spent five years (1998-2002) in politics. First as Head of the Municipal Department of Arts &amp; Culture of the Bavarian state capital Munich. Then he held a ministerial office as the State Minister for Culture and Media and was thus a member of the national government of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Gerhard Schröder]]. During his time in office, Nida-Rümelin voiced criticism on the implementation of the [[Bologna Process]], the European reformation process of the higher education. He recently criticized German policies aiming to increase the tertiary education rates and recommended instead to further foster German "dual system" of vocational training. His book ''How the rush to universities is leading to a crisis of professional and academic education'' stimulated a nationwide debate on education policy.&lt;ref&gt;Nida-Rümelin, J., [http://www.julian.nida-ruemelin.de/category/publikationen/monographie/ Der Akademisierungswahn]. Zur Krise beruflicher und akademischer Bildung, Hamburg: edition Körber-Stiftung, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nida-Rümelin publishes inside and outside of academia. His non-academic articles are regularly published in major German and European newspaper such as [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]], [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], [[Die Zeit]], [[Le Monde]], [[La Repubblica]] on a range of topics including Europe, economics and ethics, as well as the digitalisation of our society. The article ''[https://www.socialeurope.eu/the-case-for-a-change-of-course-in-european-policy The Case for a Change of Course in European Policy]'', co-authored with Peter Bofinger and Jürgen Habermas, was translated and published in 12 languages.

== Philosophy ==
Nida-Rümelin propounds an approach to practical philosophy based on his theory of  “Structural Rationality.” As an alternative to consequentialism, it avoids the dichotomy between moral and extra-moral rationality that is typical in Kantian approaches, and is thus able to integrate a vast complexity of practical reasons that result in coherent practice. Whereas for Kant, rule orientation is constitutive for moral agency, the structural account of rationality extends to the more general idea that rationality consists in embedding situated or point-wise optimization within the broader structure of agency. The intimate connection between morality and rationality that Kant postulates becomes one aspect of the broader, all-encompassing account of acting in such a way that fits into a desirable structure of agency. The practice of giving and taking reasons is understood as aiming at both interpersonal and intrapersonal structural coherence. In this way, the account of structural rationality avoids the dichotomy of reasons - moral versus extra-moral - and allows us to make use of the conceptual frame of decision and game theory in order to clarify some essential aspects of practical coherence. For example, the postulates of the von Neumann/Morgenstern utility theorem are now interpreted as rules of practical coherence and not as axioms of consequentialist optimization. The utility function becomes a mere representation of coherent preferences and expected utility maximization can no longer be interpreted as optimizing the consequences of one's actions. The term “utility” is misleading and should be replaced by “subjective valuation.” The deontological character of structural rationality is compatible with using the conceptual framework of decision theory. This may come as a surprise, but is only due to a logically stringent interpretation of the utility theorem and other theorems of decision and game theory. The usual economic interpretation is only one among many others and in fact, this interpretation is incompatible with most of the practical reasons that we take to be indispensable. The structural account of rationality is embedded in the everyday practice of giving and taking reasons.

Drawing on these considerations, Nida-Rümelin deals with the relationship between philosophy and ''Lebenswelt'' (life-world)/ ''Lebensform'' (form of life). His position is inspired by Wittgenstein's philosophy. In contrary to Wittgenstein, Nida-Rümelin emphasizes the unity of practice, viz. the unity of the person (the agent) and societal interactions. Individuals strive for coherence regarding their beliefs, epistemic attitudes, actions and emotive attitudes. Taking this as a starting point any incoherences can be criticized and are the impetus for philosophy in general, and for ethical theory more specifically. Philosophical theory has to be careful not to leave the common ground of the human practice of giving and taking reasons. It cannot reinvent reasons; it cannot postulate some principles and deduce moral duties from them. Ethical principles can only be systematizations of a given practice of reasoning. Nida-Rümelin takes the side of pragmatism in its conflict against rationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Nida-Rümelin, J., [http://www.julian.nida-ruemelin.de/publikationen/ Philosophie und Lebensform], Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

His theory is characterized as humanism  that starts from the ''conditio humana'', i.e. the common elements of the human condition over time and between cultures. Humanism has both an anthropological and an ethical dimension. The anthropological dimension is presented in core normative concepts like (structural) rationality, freedom and responsibility. Humanists think that the ability to act and believe and feel based on reasons is essential in order to understand the human condition. This does not however directly imply humanistic ethics. Human agency requires the ability to weigh reasons and act upon the result of weighing reasons, but it does not ensure morally acceptable agency. Even an officer in a Nazi concentration camp may act by weighing reasons. Humanistic ethics must discriminate between good and bad reasons, good and bad forms of reasoning, good and bad forms of emotive attitudes. Hating somebody because he lives a different life is irrational, as seen in the hatred of homosexuals in a majority heterosexual community, or hatred based on skin colour. The structural account of rationality is optimistic insofar as it assumes that clarifying reasons that strive towardsat intra- and interpersonally coherent agency and belief allow the elimination of bad, misleading reasons of all the three kinds mentioned above (practical, theoretical, and emotive reasons). Therefore, the relationship between anthropological humanism and ethical humanism is not deductive, but pragmatic. Those who take anthropological humanism seriously tend to embrace a humanistic ethos and those who reject humanistic principles of agency tend to fight against anthropological humanism, expressed in different forms: social Darwinism, racism, reductionist naturalism, chauvinist nationalism, discriminating sexism and other forms of anti-humanism. Since communication plays a central role in this form of humanism, Nida-Rümelin presented an account of humanistic semantics.

Nida-Rümelin defends a basic, non-ontological, non-metaphysical realism against instrumentalism in the philosophy of science, positivism, and post-modernism in practical philosophy, the humanities and the social sciences. Realism is not a metaphysical postulate but it is part of our everyday practice of giving and taking reasons (form of life). This practice requires facts that individuals find by developing arguments for and against certain hypotheses. Realism is part of our way of life and this makes it implausible to assume that the sciences and humanities can be understood in an anti-realist manner, as is assumed by instrumentalists, constructivists and post-modernists. It is the continuity between everyday life (form of life) and science that speaks in favor the existence of facts. They are not constituted by beliefs, neither by the beliefs of an individual (solipsism), nor by the beliefs of collectives (cultures) or even ideal discourse communities as seen in the work of Jürgen Habermas, or in Hilary Putnam's so-called internal realism, which is in fact a version of idealism.&lt;ref&gt;Nida-Rümelin, J, „Moralische Tatsachen.“ in [http://www.julian.nida-ruemelin.de/category/publikationen/sammelband/ Moralischer Realismus? Zur kohärentistischen Metaethik Julian Nida-Rümelins], hrsg. von von der Pfordten, Dietmar, 17–57. Münster: Mentis, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturalism is the dominant metaphysical attitude in the natural sciences as well as in a good part of the social sciences and even in the humanities (sometimes seen in a combination of post-modernism and naturalism). Nida-Rümelin shows that this implicit or explicit naturalism cannot be maintained. The impetus behind most of his arguments against naturalism is pragmatist: he takes the constituency of human agency as given and tries to show that these constituents are incompatible with naturalism. There is no plausible naturalistic interpretation of reason, freedom, and responsibility. Nida-Rümelin first presented his arguments in a trilogy of books: the first about practical reason (2001), the second about freedom (2005), and the third about responsibility (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Nida-Rümelin's books are titled in German: [http://www.julian.nida-ruemelin.de/category/publikationen/monographie/ Über menschliche Freiheit]. Stuttgart: Reclam, 2005; [http://www.julian.nida-ruemelin.de/category/publikationen/monographie/ Strukturelle Rationalität: Ein philosophischer Essay über praktische Vernunft]. Stuttgart: Reclam, 2001; [http://www.julian.nida-ruemelin.de/category/publikationen/monographie/ Verantwortung]. Stuttgart: Reclam, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Practical reason, epistemic and practical freedom, epistemic, practical and emotive responsibility are interpreted as three aspects of the same phenomenon: being affected by reasons. This does not mean that the chain of reasoning does not come to an end. On the contrary, here again Nida-Rümelin is close to Wittgenstein in claiming that all reasoning ends in the indisputable elements of our shared form of life. It is irrational to doubt everything, or as Wittgenstein claims, there are some things that a sensible human man will not doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, On Certainty, Basil Blackwell, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, reasoning is relevant for actions. To doubt it would mean that human beings can transcend their human condition. As Peter Strawson argued in an influential article 'Freedom and Resentment,' being reasonable means that individuals do not exclusively depend on factors beyond their control. What individuals think to be right is relevant for what they do.&lt;ref&gt;Strawson, P., Freedom and resentment and other essays. Routledge, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There cannot be any form of naturalistic determination that excludes reasoning itself. Nida-Rümelin takes the argument against the reduction of logics to psychology (Frege, Husserl) as an argument in favor of the gradual autonomy of reason. In being able to reason logically, individuals follows logical laws that cannot be identified with psychological or neurophysiological data. Additionally, Nida-Rümelin takes the insights of Alonzo Church and Kurt Gödel from the 1930s regarding non-computability showing that reasoning cannot be exclusively algorithmic.&lt;ref&gt;Gödel, K, „Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme I.“ Monatshefte für Mathematik und Physik 38, Nr. 1 (1931): 173-198.&lt;/ref&gt; As a naturalist position takes causal processes to be algorithmic, reasoning cannot be naturalized. Humanism in Nida-Rümelin's sense therefore excludes deductionist naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;Nida-Rümelin, J, [http://www.julian.nida-ruemelin.de/category/publikationen/monographie/ Humanistische Reflexionen], Berlin: Suhrkamp, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katarina A. Jovanović''' (8 April 1869 – 1 May 1954) was a Serbian translator, literary historian, publicist, philosopher, journalist and humanitarian. She translated into German [[Petar II Petrović Njegoš]]'s masterpiece "Mountain Wreath" (''Gorski Vijenac'').

==Biography==
Katarina A. Jovanović was born in [[Belgrade]], 8 April 1869. She spent most of her life abroad, having lived only 16 years in Serbia. Never forgetting her homeland, Katarina started her humanitarian work during the [[Balkan Wars]]. Thanks to her work, the Swiss Red Cross sent its mission and hospital in 1914, when the [[World War I]] broke out. She participated in the founding of the Department for Serbian Soldiers at the Swiss Red Cross and the “Zurich Bureau for the Location of Missing Persons”, which was re-established during the [[World War II]]. She helped locate the missing, and organized distribution of humanitarian aid for the sick, wounded and imprisoned Serbian soldiers, their families and the families of the soldiers fighting at the [[Salonika Front]]. Jovanović also helped Serbian schoolchildren and students, orphans and all those who found themselves far away from their homeland. Her kindness earned her the nickname “Little Mother” (Mamica). She died in [[Zurich]] on 31 May 1954.&lt;ref name="bastabalkana"&gt;{{cite web|title=Katarina Jovanović "Mamica" koju pamti dijaspora i svet|url=http://www.bastabalkana.com/2013/08/katarina-jovanovic-mamica-koju-pamti-dijaspora-i-svet/|website=Bašta Balkana Magazin|accessdate=28 April 2018|language=Seriban|date=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Novosti"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loš|first1=Tatjana|title=Katarina A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8105">[[File:Canute_rebukes_his_courtiers.png|thumb|  "Canute rebukes his courtiers" by [[Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville]]]]
The story of '''''King Canute and the tide''''' is an [[apocryphal]] anecdote illustrating the [[piety]] or [[humility]] of King [[Canute the Great]], recorded in the 12th century by  [[Henry of Huntingdon]].

In the story, Canute demonstrates to his flattering courtiers that he has no control over the elements (the incoming tide), explaining that secular power is vain compared to the [[omnipotence|supreme power]] of God.
The episode is frequently alluded to in contexts where the futility of "trying to stop the tide" of an inexorable event is pointed out, but usually misrepresenting Canute as believing he had supernatural powers, when Huntingdon's story in fact relates the opposite.

==The episode==
[[Henry of Huntingdon]] tells the story as one of three examples of Canute's "graceful and magnificent" behaviour (outside of his bravery in warfare),&lt;ref&gt;''Enimvero extra numerum bellorum, quibus maxime splenduit, tria gessit eleganter &amp; magnifice''&lt;/ref&gt; the other two being his arrangement of the marriage of [[Gunhilda of Denmark|his daughter]] to the later [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor]], and the negotiation of a reduction in tolls on the roads  [[Arelat|across Gaul]] to Rome at the [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor#Imperial coronation|imperial coronation]] of 1027.

In Huntingdon's account, Canute set his throne by the sea shore and commanded the [[tide|incoming tide]] to halt and not wet his feet and robes. Yet "continuing to rise as usual [the tide] dashed over his feet and legs without respect to his royal person. Then the king leapt backwards, saying: 'Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings, for there is none worthy of the name, but He whom heaven, earth, and sea obey by eternal laws.{{'"}} He then hung his gold crown on a [[crucifix]], and never wore it again "to the honour of God the almighty King".&lt;ref name="Henry of Hntdn., ''The Chronicle'', p. 199"&gt;Henry of Huntingdon, ''The Chronicle'', p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later historians repeated the story, most of them adjusting it to have Canute more clearly aware that the tides would not obey him, and staging the scene to rebuke the flattery of his courtiers.
There are also earlier parallels in Celtic stories of men who commanded the tides, namely Saint [[Illtud]] of [[Glamorgan]], [[Maelgwn Gwynedd|Maelgwn]], king of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]], and Tuirbe, of Tuirbe's Strand in [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;[[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]]: "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2797899 Cnut and the Waves]": ''Man'', Vol. 60, (January 1960), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proverbial reference==
Proverbial reference to the legend in modern journalism or politics usually casts the story in terms of "Canute's arrogance" of "attempting to stop the tide". 
It was cited, for example, by [[Stacy Head]] as typifying the [[New Orleans]] city council's response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] (2005), or by [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)|Mark Stephens]] in reference to [[Ryan Giggs]] as "the King Canute of football"  for his attempts of stopping "the unstoppable tide of information" on the internet in the [[2011 British privacy injunctions controversy]]. That is a misrepresentation of Huntingdon's account, whose Canute uses the tide to demonstrate his inability to control the elements and his deference to the greater authority of God.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13524677 Is King Canute misunderstood?] BBC news story&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodore Dalrymple]] refers to the story, without misattributing motives of arrogance to Canute, in the context of the [[international reaction to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|British reaction to the Ukraine crisis]] (2014), saying 
{{quote|Political power or office often gives those who possess it the illusion that they control events. That, after all, is the reason why the story of King Canute retains, and will always retain, its relevance to the current political situation.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Dalrymple, [http://www.salisburyreview.com/Theodore_Dalrymple/drone.html Droning over the Caucasus], The Salisbury Review, 4 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Warren Burger]], the [[Chief Justice of the United States]], mentions Canute in the 1980 decision ''[[Diamond v. Chakrabarty]]'' (447 U.S. 303), stating the denial of a patent for a micro-organism "is not likely to put an end to genetic research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/447/303.html |title=Diamond V. Chakrabarty &amp;#124; Findlaw |website=Caselaw.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burger likens doing so to Canute commanding the tides.

==Historicity and possible location==
The contemporary ''[[Encomium Emmae]]'' has no mention of the episode, which has been taken as indicating its ahistoricity, as it would seem that so pious a dedication might have been recorded there, since the same source gives an "eye-witness account of his lavish gifts to the monasteries and poor of [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] when on the way to Rome, and of the tears and breast-beating which accompanied them".&lt;ref name="Lawson125"&gt;Lawson, M. K., ''Cnut – England's Viking King'', Stroud: Tempus (2nd ed. 2004), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Goscelin]], writing later in the 11th century, instead has Canute place his crown on a crucifix at Winchester one Easter, with no mention of the sea, and "with the explanation that the king of kings was more worthy of it than he". Nevertheless, there may be a "basis of fact, in a planned act of piety" behind this story.&lt;ref name="Lawson125"/&gt; 
On the other hand, [[Malcolm Godden]] says the story is simply "a 12th Century legend... and those 12th Century historians were always making up stories about kings from Anglo-Saxon times".&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

The site of the episode is often identified as [[Thorney Island (London)|Thorney Island]] (now known as [[Westminster]]), where Canute set up a royal palace during his reign over [[Anglo-Saxon London|London]].&lt;ref&gt;The Palace of Westminster Factsheet G11, General Series, Revised March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/estatehistory/the-middle-ages/anglosaxon-royal-palace/ Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.] Living Heritage. History of the Parliamentary Estate: Anglo-Saxon origins&lt;/ref&gt; 
Conflictingly, a sign on [[Southampton]] city centre's Canute Road reads, "Near this spot AD 1028 Canute reproved his courtiers".&lt;ref name=Archaeology&gt;{{cite web|title=Canute Castle Hotel |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/s-leisure/artsheritage/history/archaeology/archaeology-unit/sitesbyarea/bargate-ward/canute-castle.aspx |work=Archaeological Sites |publisher=Southampton City Council |accessdate=21 March 2012 |date=January 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428024210/http://www.southampton.gov.uk/s-leisure/artsheritage/history/archaeology/archaeology-unit/sitesbyarea/bargate-ward/canute-castle.aspx |archivedate=28 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Maps, Canute Road Southampton|url=http://g.co/maps/q97zq|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bosham]] in [[West Sussex]] also claims to be the site of this episode, as does [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] in [[Lincolnshire]]. As Gainsborough is inland, if the story is true then Canute would have been trying to turn back the [[tidal bore]] known as the [[Trent aegir|aegir]].

'''Lacanianism''' is the study of, and development of, the ideas and theories of the dissident French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]. Beginning as a commentary on the writings of [[Freud]], Lacanianism developed into a new psychoanalytic theory of humankind,&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Bowie, ''Lacan'' (1991) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; and spawned a worldwide [[Lacanian movement|movement]] of its own.

It has been argued that {{quote|Lacan's work must be read as presupposing the entire content of classical Freudianism, otherwise it would simply be another philosophy or intellectual system"|[[Fredric Jameson]]&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lacanianism began as a philosophical/linguistic re-interpretation of [[Freud]]'s original teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Bowie, ''Lacan'' (1991) p. 111 and p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; How far it subsequently became an independent body of thought has been, and remains, a matter of debate—Lacan himself famously informing his followers: {{quote|It is up to you to be Lacanians if you wish. I am a Freudian&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, J., "Overture to the 1st International Encounter of the Freudian Field" in ''[[Hurly-Burly (journal)|Hurly-Burly]]'', Issue 6, September 2011, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The wide extent of Lacan's evolving intellectual stances, and his inability to find a settled institutional framework for his work, has meant that over time the Lacanian movement has been subject to numerous schisms and continuing divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Élisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Cambridge 2005) p. 432-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of Lacan's thought==

Lacan considered the human psyche to be framed within the three orders of [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|The Imaginary]], [[The Symbolic]] and [[The Real#Psychoanalysis|The Real]] (RSI).&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The three divisions in their varying emphases also correspond roughly to the development of Lacan's thought. As he himself put it in Seminar XXII, "I began with the Imaginary, I then had to chew on the story of the Symbolic...and I finished by putting out for you this famous Real".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. M. Mellard, ''Beyond Lacan'' (2006) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Lacan===
Lacan's early psychoanalytic contributions centered on the questions of image, identification and unconscious [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]]. Developing [[Henri Wallon (psychologist)|Henri Wallon]]'s concept of infant mirroring, he used the idea of the [[mirror stage]] to demonstrate the imaginary nature of the ego, in opposition to the views of [[ego psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1995) p. xx–xxii and p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structuralist Lacan===
In the fifties, the focus of Lacan's interest shifted to the symbolic order of kinship, culture, social structure and roles—all mediated by the acquisition of language—into which each one of us is born and with which we all have to come to terms.&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 92-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of therapy became that of dealing with disruptions on the part of the Imaginary of the structuring role played by the signifier/Other/Symbolic Order.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Fink, ''The Lacanian Subject'' (1997) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Real: Poststructuralism===
The sixties saw Lacan's attention increasingly focused on what he termed the Real—not external consensual reality, but rather that unconscious element in the personality, linked to [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], dream and the drive, which resists signification.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

The Real was what was lacking or absent from every totalising structural theory;&lt;ref&gt;Y. Stavrakakis, ''The Lacanian Left'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the form of [[jouissance]], and the persistence of the symptom or synthome, marked Lacan's shifting of psychoanalysis from modernity to postmodernity.

==Criticism==
Literary critic [[Frederick Crews]] writes that when Deleuze and Guattari "indicted Lacanian psychoanalysis as a capitalist disorder" and "pilloried analysts as the most sinister priest-manipulators of a psychotic society" in ''Anti-Oedipus'', their "demonstration was widely regarded as unanswerable" and "devastated the already shrinking Lacanian camp in Paris."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Crews, Frederick |title=Skeptical Engagements |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1986 |page=176 |isbn=0-19-503950-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacanianisms==
Lacan's thinking was intimately geared not only to the work of Freud but to that of the most prominent of his psychoanalytic successors—[[Heinz Hartmann]], [[Melanie Klein]], [[Michael Balint]], [[D. W. Winnicott]] and more.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 334-7&lt;/ref&gt; With Lacan's break with official psychoanalysis in 1963–1964, however, a tendency developed to look for a pure, self-contained Lacanianism, without psychoanalytic trappings.&lt;ref&gt;Élisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (1999) p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques-Alain Miller]]'s index to ''Ecrits'' had already written of "the Lacanian epistemology...the analytic experience (in its Lacanian definition...)";&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (1997) p. 326-7&lt;/ref&gt; and where the old guard of first-generation disciples like [[Serge Leclaire]] continued to stress the importance of the re-reading of Freud, the new recruits of the sixties and seventies favoured instead an ahistorical Lacan, systematised after the event into a rigorous if over-simplified theoretical whole.&lt;ref&gt;Élisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (1999) p. 305-6 and p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main phases may be identified in Lacan's mature work:&lt;ref&gt;James M. Mellard, ''Beyond Lacan'' (2006) p. 49-54&lt;/ref&gt; his Fifties exploration of [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]] and [[the Symbolic]]; his concern with the Real and the lost object of desire, the [[objet petit a]], during the Sixties; and a final phase highlighting [[jouissance]] and the mathematical formulation of psychoanalytic teaching.

As the fifties Lacan developed a distinctive style of teaching based on a linguistic reading of Freud, so too he built up a substantial following within the [[Société Française de Psychanalyse]] [SFP], with [[Serge Leclaire]] only the first of many French "Lacanians".&lt;ref&gt;Élisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Cambridge 2005) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; It was this phase of his teaching that was memorialised in ''Écrits'', and which first found its way into the English-speaking world, where more Lacanians were thus to be found in English or Philosophy Departments than in clinical practice.&lt;ref&gt;David Macey, 'Introduction', Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (1994) p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

However the very extent of Lacan's following raised serious criticisms: he was accused both of abusing the positive [[transference]] to tie his analysands to himself, and of magnifying their numbers by the use of shortened analytic sessions.&lt;ref&gt;David Macey, 'Introduction', Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (1994) p. xii–iv&lt;/ref&gt; The questionable nature of his following was one of the reasons for his failure to gain recognition for his teaching from the [[International Psychoanalytic Association|IPA]] recognition for the French form of Freudianism that was "Lacanianism"&lt;ref&gt;Élisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Cambridge 2005) p.  248&lt;/ref&gt;—a failure that led to his founding the [[École Freudienne de Paris]] (EFP) in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;David Macey, 'Introduction', Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (1994) p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his closest and most creative followers, such as [[Jean Laplanche]], chose the IPA over Lacan at this point, in the first of many subsequent Lacanian schisms.&lt;ref&gt;Élisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Cambridge 2005) p.  259&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside France===

Lacan's 1973 ''Letter to the Italians'',&lt;ref&gt;J. Lacan ''Letter to the Italians'', 1973 – see [http://www.lacanianworks.net/?p=137] translation as pdf: [http://www.lacaninireland.com/web/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Italian-note-1973.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; nominated [[Muriel Drazien]], [[Giacomo Contri]] and [[Armando Verdiglione]] to carry his teaching in Italy.

As a body of thought, Lacanianism began to make its way into the English-speaking world from the sixties onwards, influencing [[film theory]], feminist thought, and [[psychoanalytic criticism]],&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi, The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1996) p. 270 and p. 246-8&lt;/ref&gt; as well as politics and social sciences,&lt;ref&gt;Y. Stravrakakis, ''The Lacanian Left'' (2007) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; primarily through the concepts of the Imaginary and the Symbolic. As the role of the real and of jouissance in opposing structure became more widely recognised, however, so too Lacanianism developed as a tool for the exploration of the divided subject of [[postmodernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Elliott, ''Social Theory Since Freud'' (2013) p. 3-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Lacan's death, however, much of the public attention focused on his work began to decline. Lacan had always been criticised for an obscurantist writing style;&lt;ref&gt;R. Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (1996) p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; and many of his disciples simply replicated the mystificatory elements in his work (in a sort of [[Transference|transferential]] identification)&lt;ref&gt;Y. Stravrakakis, ''Lacan and the Political'' (1999) p. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; without his freshness.

Where interest in Lacanianism did revive in the 21st century, it was in large part the work of figures like [[Slavoj Žižek]] who have been able to ''use'' Lacan's thought for their own intellectual ends, without the sometimes stifling orthodoxy of many of the formal Lacanian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Stravrakakis, ''The Lacanian Left'' (2007) p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; The continued influence of Lacanianism is thus paradoxically strongest in those who seem to have embraced [[Malcolm Bowie]]'s recommendation: "learn to unlearn the Lacanian idiom in the way Lacan unlearns the Freudian idiom".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacanian movement==
===During Lacan's lifetime===
[[Élisabeth Roudinesco]] has suggested that, after the founding of the EFP “the history of psychoanalysis in France became subordinate to that of Lacanianism...the Lacanian movement occupied thereafter the motor position in relation to which the other movements were obliged to determine their course'”.&lt;ref&gt;Élisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan &amp; Co'' (1990) p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; There was certainly a large expansion in the numbers of the school, if arguably at the expense of quantity over quality, as a flood of psychologists submerged the analysts who had come with him from the SFP.&lt;ref&gt;Élisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Cambridge 2005) p.  293-5&lt;/ref&gt; Protests against the new regime reached a head with the introduction of the self-certifying 'passe' to analytic status, and old comrades such as [[François Perrier (psychoanalyst)|François Perrier]] broke away in the bitter schism of 1968 to found the Quatrieme Groupe.

However, major divisions remained within the EDF underwent another painful split over the question of analytic qualifications. There remained within the movement a broad division between the old guard of first generation Lacanians', focused on the [[Symbolic order|symbolic]]&lt;ref&gt;James A. Mellard, ''Beyond Lacan'' (2006) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;—on the study of Freud through the structural linguistic tools of the fifties&lt;ref&gt;Élisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Cambridge 2005) p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;—and the younger group of mathematicians and philosophers centred on [[Jacques-Alain Miller]], who favoured a self-contained Lacanianism, formalised and free of its Freudian roots.

As the seventies Lacan spoke of the mathematicisation of psychoanalysis and coined the term '[[matheme]]' to describe its formulaic abstraction, so Leclaire brusquely dismissed the new formulas as “graffiti”&lt;ref&gt;David Macey, 'Introduction', Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (1994) p. xxxii–ii&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, despite these and other tensions, the EDF held together under the charisma of their Master, until (despairing of his followers) Lacan himself dissolved the school in 1980 the year before his death.

===Criticism===

[[Frederick Crews]] writes that when Deleuze and Guattari "indicted Lacanian psychoanalysis as a capitalist disorder" and "pilloried analysts as the most sinister priest-manipulators of a psychotic society" in ''Anti-Oedipus'', their "demonstration was widely regarded as unanswerable" and "devastated the already shrinking Lacanian camp in Paris."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Crews, Frederick |title=Skeptical Engagements |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1986 |page=176 |isbn=0-19-503950-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Lacan===&lt;!-- 'Post-Lacanianism' and 'Post-Lacanian' redirect here--&gt;

The start of the Eighties saw the Lacanian movement dissolve into a plethora of new organisations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/mouvement-lacanien-francais-french-lacanian "French Lacanian Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; of which the Millerite Ecole de la Cause freudienne (ECF, 273 members) and the Centre de formation et de recherches psychoanalytiques (CFRP, 390 members) are perhaps the most important. By 1993 another fourteen associations had grown out of the former EDF;&lt;ref&gt;Élisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Cambridge 2005) p.  429&lt;/ref&gt; nor did the process stop there. Early resignations and splits from the ECF were followed in the late 1990s by a massive exodus of analysts worldwide from Miller's organisation under allegations of misuse of authority.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Casement, ''Who Owns Psychoanalysis?'' (2004) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts were made to re-unite the various factions, Leclaire arguing that Lacanianism was "becoming ossifed, stiffening into a kind of war of religion, into theoretical debates that no longer contribute anything new".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Élisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Cambridge 2005) p.  431&lt;/ref&gt; But with French Lacanianism (in particular) haunted by a past of betrayals and conflict&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Pommier, ''Erotic Anger'' (2001) p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt;—by faction after faction claiming their segment of Lacanian thought as the only genuine one&lt;ref&gt;Ann Casement, ''Who Owns Psychoanalysis?'' (2004) p. 2o4&lt;/ref&gt;—reunification of any kind has proven very problematic; and Roudinesco was perhaps correct to conclude that "'Lacanianism, born of subversion and a wish to transgress, is essentially doomed to fragility and dispersal".&lt;ref&gt;Élisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Cambridge 2005) p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;

====Topology====

Three main divisions can be made in contemporary Lacanianism.
*In one form, the academic reading of a de-clinicalised Lacan has become a pursuit in itself.&lt;ref&gt;Élisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Cambridge 2005) p. 434-5&lt;/ref&gt;
* The (self-styled) legitimatism of the ECF, developed into an international movement with strong Spanish support as well as Latin American roots,&lt;ref&gt;Élisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Cambridge 2005) p. 430-83&lt;/ref&gt; set itself up as a rival challenge to the IPA.
* The third form is a plural Lacanianism, best epitomiesd in the moderate CFRP, with its abandonment of the passe and openness to traditional psychoanalysis,&lt;ref&gt;Élisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Cambridge 2005) p. 440-1&lt;/ref&gt; and (after the 1995 dissolution) in its two successors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/mouvement-lacanien-francais-french-lacanian "French Lacanian Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to rejoin the IPA remain problematic, however, not least due to the persistence of the 'short session' and of Lacan's rejection of [[countertransference]] as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Madhyamakāvatāra''''' ({{bo|w=dbu ma la 'jug-pa}}) is a text by [[Candrakīrti]] (600–c. 650) on the [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]] school of [[Buddhist philosophy]]. It is a commentary on the meaning of [[Nagarjuna]]'s ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' and the ''[[Ten Stages Sutra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rigpa Shedra (January 2009). 'Introduction to the Middle Way'. Source: [http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Madhyamakavatara] (accessed: April 10, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Sutra of the Ten Bhumis' (Skt. Daśabhūmika-sūtra, Wyl. phags pa sa bcu pa'i mdo), the nomenclature given to the thirty-first chapter of the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, within the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon]] this text is classified as commentarial literature.&lt;ref&gt;Gyamtso, Khenpo Tsultrim (2003) ''The Sun of Wisdom: Teachings on the Noble Nagarjuna's Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way'' {{ISBN|1-57062-999-4}}, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;

==The text==
The Madhyamakāvatāra relates the Mādhyamaka doctrine of [[śūnyatā]] to the "spiritual discipline" (Sanskrit: [[sādhanā]]) of a [[bodhisattva]]. The Madhyamakāvatāra contains eleven chapters, where each addresses one of the ten [[pāramitā]]s or "perfections" fulfilled by bodhisattvas as they traverse the 'ten stages' (Sanskrit: [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)|bhūmi]]) to [[buddhahood]], which is the final chapter.&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (2004).

{{good article}}
'''Marcellina''' was an [[early Christianity|early Christian]] [[Carpocrates|Carpocratian]] religious leader in the mid-second century AD known primarily from the writings of [[Irenaeus]] and [[Origen]]. She originated in [[Alexandria]], but moved to [[Rome]] during the episcopate of [[Pope Anicetus|Anicetus]] ({{circa}} 157 – 168). She attracted large numbers of followers and founded the Carpocratian sect of '''Marcellians'''. Like other Carpocratians, Marcellina and her followers believed in [[antinomianism]], also known as [[libertine|libertinism]], the idea that obedience to laws and regulations is unnecessary in order to attain salvation. They believed that [[Jesus]] was only a man, but saw him as a model to be emulated, albeit one which a believer was capable of surpassing. Marcellina's community appears to have sought to literally implement the foundational Carpocratian teaching of [[social egalitarianism]]. The Marcellians in particular are reported to have [[Human branding|branded]] their disciples on the insides of their right [[earlobe]]s and [[Religious images in Christian theology|venerated images]] of Jesus as well as Greek philosophers such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]]. Although the Marcellians identified themselves as "[[Gnosis|gnostics]]", many modern scholars do not classify them as members of the sect of [[Gnosticism]].

==Historical context==
[[File:Dura Europos baptistry women at the tomb.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Fresco from the [[nave]] of the [[Dura-Europos church]], dating to {{circa}} 240 AD, depicting [[Mary Magdalene]] alongside two other women (the third now almost completely missing due to extensive damage) approaching the [[empty tomb]] of Jesus.{{sfn|Haskins|2005|pages=58–59}} Such women were the "explicit models" for Marcellina and other early female preachers.{{sfn|Streete|1999|page=352}}]]

Women played prominent roles in many early Christians sects as prophets, teachers, healers, missionaries, and [[presbyter]]s.{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}} [[Mary Magdalene]] and [[Mary of Bethany]] were female followers of Jesus who are mentioned in the gospels and were believed to know the "[[Sacred mysteries|mysteries]]" of the [[Kingship and kingdom of God|kingdom of God]].{{sfn|Streete|1999|page=352}} Women like Mary and Martha were the explicit role models for Marcellina and her fellow female preachers.{{sfn|Streete|1999|page=352}} A creed that may have been recited at Christian initiation ceremonies is quoted by the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] in {{bibleverse|Galatians|3:28|9}}: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=61}} In the late first century, [[Marcion of Sinope]] ({{circa}} 85 – {{circa}} 160) appointed women as presbyters on an equal basis as men.{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}}

In the second century, the [[Valentinianism|Valentinians]], a Gnostic sect, regarded women as equal to men.{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}} The [[Montanism|Montanists]] regarded two prophetesses, [[Maximilla]] and [[Prisca (Prophet)|Prisca]], as the founders of their movement.{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}} Female religious leaders like Marcellina were not favored by orthodox theologians, who accused them of madness, unchastity, and [[demonic possession]].{{sfn|Streete|1999|page=352}} The [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Tertullian]] ({{circa}} 155 – {{circa}} 240) complained: "These heretical women—how audacious they are! They have no modesty; they are bold enough to teach, to engage in argument, to enact [[exorcism]]s, to undertake cures, and, it may be, even to baptize!"{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}} He denounced one female religious leader in North Africa as "that viper".{{sfn|Pagels|1989|page=60}}

==Life and teachings==
===Carpocratian teachings===
As a Carpocratian, Marcellina taught the doctrine of [[Antinomianism|antinomianism]], or [[Libertine|libertinism]],{{sfn|Rudolph|1983|page=299}}{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} which holds that only faith and love are necessary to attain salvation and that all other perceived requirements, especially obedience to laws and regulations, are unnecessary.{{sfn|Rudolph|1983|page=299}}{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} She, like other Carpocratians, believed that the [[soul]] must follow the path to redemption, possibly going through many [[incarnation]]s.{{sfn|Rudolph|1983|page=299}}{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} The goal of the believer is the escape from the cycle of reincarnation by ascending through several stages of deification.{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} The Carpocratians believed that Jesus was only human, not divine,{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} and saw him as a exemplary model to be followed, but an example which a particularly devout believer was capable of surpassing.{{sfn|Rudolph|1983|page=299}} Jesus's prime virtue was that he could perfectly remember the Divine from his [[pre-existence]].{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} They also venerated Greek philosophers as models to be emulated as well.{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}}{{sfn|Taylor|2018|pages=214–215}} The Marcellians' syncretic cult of images was a natural consequence of this teaching.{{sfn|Rudolph|1983|page=299}}{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} One of the foundational teachings of the Carpocratians was the idea of [[social egalitarianism]], which advocated equality for all people.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=319}}{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} Marcellina's position as the leader of the Carpocratian community in Rome indicates that, for her community at least, this was an idea which was meant to be literally implemented.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=319}} Some Carpocratians, possibly including Marcellina, [[Communalism|held all property in common]] and [[Open relationship|shared sexual partners]].{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}} They also celebrated a form of [[agape feast]].{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}}

===''Adversus Haereses''===
[[File:Kapitolinischer Pythagoras adjusted.jpg|thumb|Irenaeus records that the Marcellians venerated images of Greek philosophers, including [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}}{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=260}}{{sfn|Williams|1996|pages=107–108, 127}} Busts of philosophers, such as this one of Pythagoras, were common objects of adoration in second-century Roman society.{{sfn|Williams|1996|pages=107–108, 127}}]]

The Church Father [[Irenaeus]] ({{circa}} 130 – {{circa}} 202) records in his apologetic treatise ''[[Adversus Haereses]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Others of them [i.e. the Carpocratians] employ outward marks, branding their disciples inside the lobe of the right ear. From among these also arose Marcellina, who came to Rome under [the episcopate of] [[Pope Anicetus|Anicetus]], and, holding these doctrines, she led multitudes astray. They style themselves Gnostics. They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] at that time when Jesus lived among them. They crown these images, and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of [[Pythagoras]], and [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irenaeus]], ''[[Adversus Haereses]]'' [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103125.htm Book I, Chapter 25, section 6], translated by Alexander Roberts and William Rambaut&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marcellina is the only woman associated with early Gnostic Christianity who is recorded to have been an active religious leader in her own right.{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=261}} Other women such as Helena (allegedly a former [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] prostitute turned muse of [[Simon Magus]]), Philumena (a prophetess associated with [[Apelles (gnostic)|Apelles]]), and Flora (a student of [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy]]) are known to have been active as prophetesses, teachers, and disciples involved in sects led by men,{{sfn|McGuire|1999|pages=260–261}} but none of them are known to have been leaders themselves.{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=261}} Nonetheless, Marcellina still appears in relation to Carpocrates, a male teacher, who appears to have been more actively involved than her in leading followers, writing treatises, and teaching students.{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=261}} Anne McGuire states that it is unclear whether this description of Marcellina in relation to Carpocrates is a result of Irenaeus's own patriarchal worldview, the actual relationship between her and him, or both.{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=261}}

Marcellina's use of images of Jesus and Greek philosophers would not have been unusual in Roman society at the time, because busts and images of philosophers were common objects of adoration in second-century Roman society.{{sfn|Williams|1996|pages=107–108, 127}}{{sfn|Taylor|2018|pages=214–215}} While Irenaeus interprets this as a sign of Marcellina's heterodox teaching,{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=108}} to any non-Christian Roman, it would have actually made her seem far less aberrant than "orthodox" Christians.{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=108}} By venerating busts of philosophers and including Jesus among them as the greatest, Marcellina's followers were honoring him in the same way that other philosophers were typically honored throughout the Greco-Roman world.{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}} The Carpocratians may have had a more intellectual outlook than other sects,{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}} since, according to [[Clement of Alexandria]], Carpocrates's son [[Epiphanes (gnostic)|Epiphanes]] had been trained in [[Platonism|Platonic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Stromata]]'' 3.5.3&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}}{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=320}} Nonetheless, [[Michael Allen Williams]] states that the veneration of images seems highly unexpected for a supposedly Gnostic sect,{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=127}} since Gnostics are thought to have held the physical body in contempt.{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=127}} He suggests that Marcellina and her followers, like their pagan contemporaries, may have viewed representations of philosophers' physical likenesses as "windows to the soul" and a means of reflecting on the person's teachings.{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=127}} [[Peter Lampe]] interprets Marcillina's use of images of famous philosophers as an indication of [[religious syncretism]].{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=320}}

[[Joan E. Taylor]] notes that Irenaeus does not state that the Marcellians' portrait of Jesus was inaccurate or that portraits of Jesus were inherently immoral.{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}} She also argues that the Marcellians' busts of Jesus and other philosophers may have survived long after their sect declined,{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}} observing that, nearly a century later, the Roman emperor [[Alexander Severus]] (reigned 222 – 235) is said to have possessed a collection of portrait busts of various philosophers, religious figures, and historical figures including Jesus, [[Orpheus]], [[Apollonius of Tyana]], [[Alexander the Great]], and [[Abraham]].{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}} She remarks, "For all we know, one of the many unidentified philosopher busts that exist in today's collections might have been thought of as Jesus in the second–third centuries."{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=215}}

According to David Brakke, the reason why Marcellina and the members of her school identified themselves as "Gnostics" was not as a sectarian identification with the branch of early Christianity known as "[[Gnosticism]]",{{sfn|Brakke|2010|pages=48–49}} but rather as an epithet for "the ideal or true Christian, the one whose acquaintance with God has been perfected".{{sfn|Brakke|2010|page=49}} He notes that Irenaeus himself identifies Marcellina and her sect with the Carpocratians, not with the "Gnostic school of thought".{{sfn|Brakke|2010|page=49}} Also, [[Hippolytus of Rome]], who relied on Irenaeus as a source, references that the another sect known as the [[Naassenes]] "call themselves 'gnostics' in their own way, as if they alone have drunk from the amazing acquaintance of the Perfect and Good."{{sfn|Brakke|2010|pages=48–49}} In the late fourth century, the ascetic monk [[Evagrius Ponticus]] described the most advanced stage of Christian asceticism as "the Gnostic",{{sfn|Brakke|2010|page=49}} indicating that, despite the association of the word "Gnostic" with Gnosticism, it still retained its original positive meaning in the sense with which Marcellina and her disciples identified.{{sfn|Brakke|2010|page=49}} [[Bentley Layton]] does not classify Marcellina and her followers as members of the Gnostic sect either.{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=42}}

===''Contra Celsum''===
[[Origen]] ({{circa}} 184 – {{circa}} 253) also briefly mentions Marcellina in his ''[[Contra Celsum]]'', stating that "[[Celsus]] knows also of Marcellians who follow Marcellina, and [[Harpocrates|Harpocratians]] who follow [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]], and others who follow [[Mary Magdalene|Mariamme]], and others who follow [[Martha of Bethany|Martha]]."{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=260}} Anne McGuire states that, because all the other figures listed by Origen in this passage are figures who appear in the canonical gospels, it is possible that the Marcellians may have regarded Marcellina, not only as a teacher and religious leader, but as "an authoritative source of apostolic tradition".{{sfn|McGuire|1999|page=260}} Williams notes that Origen seems to have been aware that the Marcellians called themselves Gnostics,{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=41}} since, elsewhere in ''Contra Celsum'', he notes that one of Celsus's arguments against Christianity was the existence of different sects, including ones "who call themselves gnostics".{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=41}} This would presumably include Marcellina and her followers,{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=41}} but Origen refrains from calling them by this term.{{sfn|Williams|1996|page=41}}

==Legacy==
It is unclear how Marcellina and her followers were regarded by orthodox Christians living in Rome during the 150s and 160s.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} Irenaeus states that, among members of his own congregation in [[Gaul]] in the 180s, "we have no fellowship with them either in doctrine or in morals or in our daily social life",{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} but this statement should not be taken to apply to Christians living in Rome over twenty years prior.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} Irenaeus also states, "[[Satan]] had set forth these people [i.e. Marcellina and her followers] to blaspheme the holy name of the church, so that the [pagan] people turn their ears from the preaching of truth when they hear their different way of teaching and think we Christians are all like them. Indeed, when they see their religiosity, they dishonor us all."{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} He adds that "They misuse the name [Christian] as a mask."{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} This indicates that Marcellina and her Carpocratian followers called themselves "Christians"{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} and, at least to outsiders, her sect appeared to be connected to other branches of Christianity.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}}

[[Peter Lampe]] states that it is possible that members of the orthodox community in Rome simply allowed Marcillina and her sect to silently coexist,{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} but that it is also possible that they may have actively condemned them.{{sfn|Lampe|2003|page=392}} [[Robert M. Grant (theologian)|Robert M. Grant]] identifies the anti-Gnostic writings of [[Polycarp]] and [[Justin Martyr]] as partially an indirect reaction against Marcellina and her permissive moral teachings.{{sfn|Grant|1990|pages=59–61}} Marcillina and other female prophets like her were consistently portrayed negatively in the histories and canons written by proponents of orthodoxy.{{sfn|Streete|1999|page=352}} According to William H. Brackney, sources indicate that Carpocratians may have continued to exist as late as the fourth century.{{sfn|Brackney|2012|page=75}}

'''Muckers''' ([[German language|Ger.]] ''Muckern'', i.e. canting bigots, hypocrites), is the nickname given to the followers of the teaching of [[Johann Heinrich Schönherr]] (1770–1826) and [[Johann Wilhelm Ebel]] (1784–1861).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=954}}  The word originates in the [[Middle Low German|Middle German]] word ''muckern'', which was used also to denote the clearing of stalls and stables.  In some areas of Germany, the word was spelled ''muggeln.'' &lt;ref&gt;''Deutsches Worterbuch von Jakob und Wilhelm Grimm''  [http://woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB/?sigle=DWB&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;lemid=GM07779#XGM07779 Mucken], Trier Center for Digital Humanities / Kompetenzzentrum für elektronische Erschließungs- und Publikationsverfahren in den Geisteswissenschaften an der Universität Trier, Accessed 14 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Schönherr, the son of a non-commissioned officer at [[Klaipėda|Memel]] in [[Prussia]], was educated at the [[university of Königsberg]], where at that time the theological faculty, under the influence of [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[idealism]], was strongly [[rationalist]] in tendency. The lad, who was miserably poor, was dissatisfied with a [[philosophy]] which stopped short of an explanation of the "[[Noumenon|thing in itself]]",{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=954}} and, having been reared in the strictest [[Lutheran orthodoxy]], set to work to develop, with the aid of the [[Bible]], a philosophy of his own.  In the end he believed himself to have reached ultimate knowledge, and became the [[prophet]] of a dualistic [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophy]] so closely analogous to [[Gnosticism]] that it might have been taken for a deliberate revival, had not Schönherr's lack of study in such theology precluded any such idea.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=954}}

Among his converts was Ebel, who from 1810 onwards gained a great reputation in Königsberg as an earnest preacher of the orthodox doctrines of "[[sin]], [[divine grace|grace]] and redemption, and in 1816 was appointed "[[archdeacon]]," i.e. principal pastor, at the [[Altstadt Church]] in Königsberg. In the pulpit he was orthodox; but he gathered about him a select circle of the initiated, to whom in private he taught Schönherr's doctrines. Schönherr himself sank into the background, and eventually died in 1826.  But Ebel continued his teaching, and was joined in 1827 by [[Heinrich Diestel]], also a [[Lutheran]] pastor of Königsberg. They became [[father confessor]]s to a wide circle of fashionable people in the Prussian capital. In view of their peculiar teaching as to "the purification of the flesh," which involved the minute regulation of the intercourse of married people, scandal was inevitable. Matters came to a head in 1835, when [[Finck von Finckenstein|Count Finckenstein]], himself formerly an initiate, denounced the two pastors and accused them of immorality.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=954–955}}

Diestel wrote two tirades against the count, who brought a successful action for [[slander]]. The group itself was dissolved in 1839. The evidence taken in the case was then laid before the [[Prussian Union of churches|old-Prussian]] Königsberg [[Consistory (Protestantism)|consistory]], and proceedings followed which became famous as the Königsberger ''Religionsprozess'' (1835–1841), ending in sentences of deprivation on both Ebel and Diestel. The charges of actual immorality were dismissed; but there is no doubt that some of their followers established practices akin to those of the [[Agapemone]] and the [[Perfectionism (psychology)|Perfectionists]]. Some of them migrated to [[Brazil]], where in 1874 at [[Porto Alegre]] a company of them came into collision with the military (see [[Revolt of the Muckers]]).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=955}}

==Popular culture==
In Brazil the Muckers are remembered in popular culture. For example in 1993, when there were number of murders near [[São Leopoldo]]; the local newspaper ''Zero Hora'' ran a headline "Violence is Resurrected in the Land of the Muckers".{{sfn|Lesser|2013|p=52}}

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, two films were made in Brazil about [[Jacobina Mentz Maurer]], one of the leaders of the Muckers Brazilian rebellion. The better known of the two films was made by [[Fábio Barreto]] in 2002 and is called ''[[A Paixão de Jacobina]]'' (''Jacobina's Passion'').{{sfn|Lesser|2013|p=52}}

The '''New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station''' (or NJAES) is an entity currently operated by [[Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey]] in conjunction with the [[New Jersey|State of New Jersey]] in the university's role as the state's sole [[land-grant university]]. Today, it conducts research in agriculture, horticulture and turf grass science, and through the [[Rutgers Cooperative Extension]] aids New Jersey farmers, landscapers, and residents in each of the state's twenty-one counties.

==History==
In 1864 the State of New Jersey named Rutgers College as their sole [[Land-grant university|land grant college]]. Pursuant to the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act of 1862]], this designation gave federal lands to the state that the state could then sell to raise money to develop practical education in agriculture, science, military science and engineering.&lt;ref name="McCormickBicenHistory"&gt;McCormick, Richard P. ''Rutgers: A Bicentennial History''. (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.87–88}}&lt;ref&gt;The Morrill Act of 1862 (P.L. 1862 ch. 130; 12 Stat. 504) was codified as [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/304 United States Code, Title 7, Chapter 13,  Subchapter I, § 304 — "Investment of proceeds of sale of land or scrip"]. Retrieved 25 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Hammell Cook]] (1818-1889), a professor of chemistry and natural sciences, influenced the state to select Rutgers over the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]). Cook was appointed state geologist in 1864 and later became the college's vice president. With the college's land grant status and new funding for scientific studies, Cook expanded his research and teaching into geology and agriculture.&lt;ref name="McCormickBicenHistory" /&gt;{{rp|pp.87–88}}&lt;ref name="CampbellMemorial1894"&gt;David Murray (compiler).

The Agricultural Experiment Station began with agriculture instruction in the college's [[Geology Hall]], built in 1872, until [[New Jersey Hall]] was built in 1889. The New Jersey state legislature provided funds to construct an "Agricultural Hall" to house the station, and Rutgers built the Richard Romanesque style building in 1889. The university operated the station from that facility and through its college farm located on what became the college's [[Cook College|Cook Campus]] where it remains today at 102 Ryders Lane in [[North Brunswick, New Jersey]].

Through the station's Office of Continuing Professional Education (OCPE), the NJAES provides [[continuing education]] programmes to residents and professionals throughout the state of New Jersey. OCPE offers courses in topic areas like Wetlands preservation, Professional Golf Course Turf Management, Food Science, Food Safety, Public Health and Safety, Landscape construction and architecture, environmental sciences, and recycling. The station aims to increase coursework and research in planned agricultural production and competitiveness; food science and engineering; nutrition, health and safety; marine and coastal resources; natural resources and the environment; and human and community resource development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cookce.rutgers.edu/main/mission.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nick Trakakis''' is a philosopher at the Australian Catholic University, where he is Assistant Director of the recently established Centre for Philosophy and Phenomenology of Religion. He has previously taught at Monash University and Deakin University, and during 2006–2007 he was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Centre for Philosophy of Religion at the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Centre for Philosophy of Religion: Fellows |url=http://www.nd.edu/~cprelig/fellows.html |publisher=University of Notre Dame |accessdate=4 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211091227/http://www.nd.edu/~cprelig/fellows.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 11 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He works mainly at the intersections of philosophy (in both the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] traditions), religion, and theology.

== Education ==

Nick Trakakis completed a Bachelor of Theology degree at St Andrew's Greek Orthodox Theological College (Sydney, Australia) and a Bachelor of Arts degree at the [[University of New England, Australia]], before going on to receive a [[First Class Honours]] in Philosophy from the [[University of Melbourne]]. His doctoral research, undertaken at Monash University, concentrated on the so-called 'evidential problem of evil', that is, the problem of determining whether the existence of human and animal [[suffering]] provides good evidence against the [[existence of God]]. A revised version of his thesis was published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] under the title of ''The God Beyond Belief''.

== Work ==

In a number of journal articles and in his recent monograph, ''The God Beyond Belief'', Trakakis considers various aspects of the evidential problem of evil, particularly as this has been formulated and developed by William Rowe. Trakakis has also written about such topics in the philosophy of religion as the [[omnipotence]] of God, [[predestination|determinist]] models of [[divine providence]], [[Wittgenstein]]ian non-realism, and the doctrine of [[karma]]. In theology and church history, he has published his views on the [[ordination of women]], the [[infallibility of the church]], the [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]] controversy, and the work of [[Gregory Palamas]].

=== The evidential argument from evil ===

The main conclusion reached by Trakakis is that Rowe's evidential argument from evil, or a version thereof, succeeds in showing that the existence of certain kinds of evil provides strong evidence against the existence of God. The possibility, however, is always left open that there may well be other evidence in support of the existence of God which outweighs or defeats the evidence of evil. 

This conclusion is based on, first, the rejection the sceptical theist's appeal to mystery, and second, the inadequacy of standard [[theodicy|theodicies]] to explain the existence of [[natural evil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The God Beyond Belief: About this book |publisher=Springer |url=https://www.springer.com/east/home/humanities/religious+studies?SGWID=5-40405-22-173662756-0 |accessdate=5 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trakakis argues that there is no good reason to accept the currently popular 'sceptical theist' response to the evidential problem of evil – that is, the response that we do not know, and we cannot be expected to know, what God's reasons are for permitting evil. Trakakis has, for example, argued that the sceptical theist position of [[Kirk Durston]] – a position which maintains that the complexity of history is such that we cannot pass judgement on the overall moral value of any particular historical event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kirk |last=Durston |title=The complexity of history and evil: a reply to Trakakis |journal=Religious Studies |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=87–99|doi=10.1017/S0034412505008139 |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; – leads to an implausible form of moral scepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nick |last=Trakakis |title=Why there is reason to remain sceptical of Durston's scepticism |journal=Religious Studies |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=101–109 |doi=10.1017/S0034412505008140 |date=March 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trakakis also maintains that some of the major theodicies that have been offered by theists (e.g., the [[free will]] theodicy, the soul-making theodicy) fail to explain why God would permit various types of evil, particularly 'natural evil' or suffering brought about by natural processes (e.g., natural disasters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nick |last=Trakakis |title=Is theism capable of accounting for any natural evil at all? |journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion |doi=10.1007/s11153-004-5895-6 |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=35–66 |date=February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he does believe that the free-will theodicy may succeed in explaining at least some kinds of moral evil. On this issue, Joel Thomas Tierno has argued against Trakakis that human freedom alone can not account for all instances of moral evil, given the scale on which we find it distributed in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Joel Thomas |last=Tierno |title=On the Alleged Connection Between Moral Evil and Human Freedom: A Response To Trakakis’ Second Critique |journal=Sophia |volume=45 |issue=2 |date=October 2006 |doi=10.1007/BF02782488 |pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
In his current research, Trakakis is exploring various approaches to the philosophy of religion, focusing in particular on analytic and Continental approaches. He has also published two volumes of poetry and philosophical reflections, ''Tears'' (2005) and ''Silent Transfigurations'' (2006), with a third volume (''Via Dolorosa'') forthcoming.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7272">The '''Nine Noble Virtues''', '''NNV''', or '''9NV''' are two sets of moral and situational ethical guidelines within certain sects of [[Odinism]] and [[Ásatrú in the United States|Ásatrú]]. One set was codified by former member of Sir [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists|British Union of Fascists and National Socialists]], John Yeowell&lt;ref&gt;"Rocking For Satan", Searchlight Magazine, November 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary,  published in "Comrade" - The News Letter of the Friends of Oswald Mosley: http://fascists.zxq.net/PDFs/ComradeMay2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (a.k.a. Stubba) and John Gibbs-Bailey (a.k.a. Hoskuld) of the [[Odinic Rite]] in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;This Is Odinism: Guidelines for Survival, published by the "Committee for the Restoration of the Odinic Rite" (or Odinist Committee) in 1974 and later re-printed (revised) by Raven Banner Editions (A Raven Banner [Pamphlet) in 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odinic-rite.org/main/the-nine-noble-virtues-and-charges-of-the-odinic-rite/ The 9 Noble Virtues - OR Site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asatrufolkassemblyblog.org/2009/07/asatru-like-most-other-religions-has.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the other set codified by [[Stephen A. McNallen]] of the [[Asatru Folk Assembly]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asatrufolkassemblyblog.org/2009/07/asatru-rules-for-personal-conduct-part.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNallen, Stephen A.; An Odinist Anthology: Selections From The Runestone, p. 13, AFA, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others believe that the earlier set, the one the Odinic Rite claim they codified, were originally put together and labelled as the Nine Noble Virtues (the “9NV”) by [[Edred Thorsson]] during his time with the original AFA.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, Jennifer; American Heathens: The Politics of Identity in a Pagan Religious Movement, Temple University Press, 2015. P. 70-72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linzie, Bil; [http://heathengods.com/library/bil_linzie/ Germanic Mythology], July 2003, P. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; They are supposedly based on [[virtue]]s found in historical [[Norse paganism]], gleaned from various sources including the [[Poetic Edda]] (particularly the [[Hávamál]] and the [[Sigrdrífumál]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odinic-rite.org/main/the-nine-noble-virtues-and-charges-of-the-odinic-rite/ The 9 Noble Virtues - OR Site]&lt;/ref&gt; and as evident in the [[Icelandic Sagas]]).

The '''Nine Charges''' are a different list of more explicitly phrased moral or ethical guidelines codified at about the same time.&lt;ref&gt;"one of the original lists, published by the Odinist Committee [old Odinic Rite], founded in 1972, was referred to as the 'Nine Charges'" Snook, Jennifer; American Heathens: The Politics of Identity in a Pagan Religious Movement, Temple University Press, 2015. P. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linzie, Bil; [http://heathengods.com/library/bil_linzie/ Germanic Mythology], July 2003, P. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
The '''Six-Fold Goal''' is yet another list of virtues, given as "Right, Wisdom, Might, Harvest, Frith and Love" by [[Stephen Flowers|Stephen Flowers (a.k.a. Edred Thorsson)]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Edred Thorsson, ''A Book of Troth'' (1989){{page needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aesirian Code of Nine''' is also used by some practitioners of Heathenism, consisting of "honor, knowledge, protect, flourish, change, fairness, conflict, balance and control."

The list of "Nine Noble Virtues" is due to either John Yeowell (a.k.a. Stubba)&lt;ref&gt;"Rocking For Satan", Searchlight Magazine, November 1997.
Obituary,  published in "Comrade" - The News Letter of the Friends of Oswald Mosley {{huh|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and John Gibbs-Bailey (a.k.a. Hoskuld), members of [[Odinic Rite]], or alternatively due to [[Edred Thorsson]], at the time member of the ''Asatru Free Assembly''.&lt;ref&gt;Snook, Jennifer; American Heathens: The Politics of Identity in a Pagan Religious Movement, Temple University Press, 2015. P. 70-72.

#To deal not hardly with the humble and the lowly.
#To remember the respect that is due to great age.

#To succour the friendless but to put no faith in the pledged word of a stranger people.
#If I hear the fool's word of a drunken man I will strive not: for many a grief and the very death groweth from out such things.
#To give kind heed to dead people: straw dead, sea dead or sword dead.
#To abide by the enactments of lawful authority and to bear with courage the decrees of the Norns.

:''For the village in Cambodia see [[Norea, Cambodia]].''
{{Inline citations|date=October 2011}}

'''Norea''' is a figure in [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] cosmology. Sometimes she is said to be the [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|syzygy]] of [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], or wife of [[Noah]], and daughter of [[Adam and Eve|Eve]]. Norea is perceived within gnostic thought as [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]] after her fall from grace.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

For a long time, Norea was known from a summary of a book called ''Noria'' in the ''[[Panarion]]'' (''Against Heresies'') of [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (26.1.3-9). According to Epiphanius, the [[Borborites]] identified Norea with [[Pyrrha]], the wife of [[Deucalion]] (a Greek figure similar to Noah), because ''nura'' means "fire" in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. She burned [[Noah's Ark]] three times, then revealed the means of recovering stolen sparks through sexual emissions. Elsewhere (39.5.2) Epiphanius says that the [[Sethianism|Sethians]] consider Horaia to be the wife of [[Seth]].

More information has been available since the discovery of the [[Nag Hammadi library]] in 1945. In ''[[Hypostasis of the Archons|The Hypostasis of the Archons]]'' (''The Reality of the Rulers''), Norea is the daughter of Eve and the younger sister of Seth; both are members of the pure race. The [[Archon (Gnosticism)|archons]] decide to destroy the world with a [[Deluge myth|deluge]], but their leader, the [[Demiurge#Gnosticism|Demiurge]], warns Noah to build an ark, which Norea tries to board. Noah stops her, so she blows upon the ark and sets it ablaze. The rulers try to rape her, but she cries to the God of the Entirety for help. The [[angel]] [[Eleleth]] appears and frightens the rulers away before revealing her origins; she is a child of the spirit.

Another Nag Hammadi text, the ''[[Thought of Norea]]'' (or ''Ode on Norea'') is a first-person account of Norea's plea to God. ''On the [[On the Origin of the World (Nag Hammadi)|Origin of the World]]'' refers the reader to an ''Account of Oraia'' and the ''First Book of Noraia'', one of which may be the same as the Book of Noria mentioned by Epiphanius.

She has several similar names, including '''Orea''' and '''Horaia''', meaning "beautiful". The name is thought to derive from a translation of Naamah, a Hebrew name which means "pleasant". The demon Naamah is called "the younger [[Lilith]]". Both Norea and Lilith call upon God to avoid an unwanted sexual encounter.

'''Relativism''' is the idea that [[points of view (philosophy)|views]] are relative to differences in perception and consideration. There is no universal, objective truth according to relativism; rather each point of view has its own truth.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/] "Relativism, roughly put, is the view that truth and falsity, right and wrong, standards of reasoning, and procedures of justification are products of differing conventions and frameworks of assessment and that their authority is confined to the context giving rise to them."&lt;/ref&gt;

The major categories of relativism vary in their degree of scope and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Baghramian]] identifies 16 (''Relativism'', 2004,Baghramian)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Moral relativism]]'' encompasses the differences in moral judgments among people and cultures.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{Cite web | last = Swoyer | first = Chris | date = February 22, 2003 | title = Relativism | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/#1.2 | accessdate = May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Truth]] relativism'' is the doctrine that there are no [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truths]], i.e., that truth is always relative to some particular frame of reference, such as a language or a culture ([[cultural relativism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Baghramian, Maria and Carter, Adam, "Relativism", "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2015 Edition)", Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/relativism/#RelAboTruAleRel/ "Relativism about truth, or alethic relativism, at its simplest, is the claim that what is true for one individual or social group may not be true for another"&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive relativism seeks to describe the differences among cultures and people without evaluation, while normative relativism evaluates the morality or truthfulness of views within a given framework.

==Forms of relativism==

===Anthropological versus philosophical relativism===
[[Anthropological relativism]] refers to a [[methodology|methodological]] stance, in which the researcher suspends (or brackets) his or her own cultural biases while attempting to understand beliefs and behaviors in their local contexts. This has become known as [[methodological relativism]], and concerns itself specifically with avoiding [[ethnocentrism]] or the application of one's own cultural standards to the assessment of other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

 |quote=...methodological relativism - impartial assessment of how knowledge develops - is the key idea for sociology of scientific knowledge...}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the basis of the so-called "[[emic]]" and "[[etic]]" distinction, in which:
* An '''emic''' or insider account of behavior is a description of a society in terms that are meaningful to the participant or actor's own culture; an emic account is therefore culture-specific, and typically refers to what is considered "[[common sense]]" within the culture under observation.
* An '''etic''' or outsider account is a description of a society by an observer, in terms that can be applied to other cultures; that is, an etic account is culturally neutral, and typically refers to the conceptual framework of the social scientist. (This is complicated when it is scientific research itself that is under study, or when there is theoretical or terminological disagreement within the social sciences.)

[[Philosophical relativism]], in contrast, asserts that the truth of a proposition depends on the metaphysical, or theoretical frame, or the instrumental method, or the context in which the proposition is expressed, or on the person, groups, or culture who interpret the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oyloiiq0CYIC&amp;pg=PA210 Locke, Shaftesbury, and Hutcheson: Contesting Diversity in the Enlightenment and Beyond by Dr. Daniel Carey]&lt;/ref&gt;

Methodological relativism and philosophical relativism can exist independently from one another, but most anthropologists base their methodological relativism on that of the philosophical variety.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2796798 Methodological and Philosophical Relativism by Gananath Obeyesekere]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptive versus normative relativism===
The concept of relativism also has importance both for [[philosophy|philosophers]] and for [[anthropology|anthropologists]] in another way. In general, anthropologists engage in descriptive relativism ("how things are" or "how things seem"), whereas philosophers engage in [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] relativism ("how things ought to be"), although there is some overlap (for example, descriptive relativism can pertain to concepts, normative relativism to truth).

Descriptive relativism assumes that certain cultural groups have different modes of thought, standards of reasoning, and so forth, and it is the anthropologist's task to describe, but not to evaluate the validity of these principles and practices of a cultural group. It is possible for an anthropologist in his or her fieldwork to be a descriptive relativist about some things that typically concern the philosopher (e.g., ethical principles) but not about others (e.g., logical principles). However, the descriptive relativist's empirical claims about epistemic principles, moral ideals and the like are often countered by anthropological arguments that such things are universal, and much of the recent literature on these matters is explicitly concerned with the extent of, and evidence for, cultural or moral or linguistic or human universals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = Donald E. |last = Brown |authorlink = Donald Brown (anthropologist) |coauthors = |title = Human Universals |publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] |year = 1991 |pages = |isbn = 0-87722-841-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that the various species of descriptive relativism are empirical claims, may tempt the philosopher to conclude that they are of little philosophical interest, but there are several reasons why this isn't so. First, some philosophers, notably Kant, argue that certain sorts of cognitive differences between human beings (or even all rational beings) are impossible, so such differences could never be found to obtain in fact, an argument that places a priori limits on what empirical inquiry could discover and on what versions of descriptive relativism could be true. Second, claims about actual differences between groups play a central role in some arguments for normative relativism (for example, arguments for normative ethical relativism often begin with claims that different groups in fact have different moral codes or ideals). Finally, the anthropologist's descriptive account of relativism helps to separate the fixed aspects of human nature from those that can vary, and so a descriptive claim that some important aspect of experience or thought does (or does not) vary across groups of human beings tells us something important about human nature and the human condition.

Normative relativism concerns normative or [[Value (ethics)|evaluative]] claims that modes of thought, standards of reasoning, or the like are only right or wrong relative to a framework. ‘Normative’ is meant in a general sense, applying to a wide range of views; in the case of beliefs, for example, normative correctness equals truth. This does not mean, of course, that framework-relative correctness or truth is always clear, the first challenge being to explain what it amounts to in any given case (e.g., with respect to concepts, truth, epistemic norms). Normative relativism (say, in regard to normative ethical relativism) therefore implies that things (say, ethical claims) are not simply true in themselves, but only have [[truth value]]s relative to broader frameworks (say, moral codes). (Many normative ethical relativist arguments run from premises about ethics to conclusions that assert the relativity of truth values, bypassing general claims about the nature of truth, but it is often more illuminating to consider the type of relativism under question directly.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/#1.2 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodernism and relativism&lt;!--'Postmodern relativism' redirects here--&gt;==
The term "relativism" often comes up in debates over [[postmodernism]], [[poststructuralism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Critics of these perspectives often identify advocates with the label "relativism". For example, the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is often considered a relativist view because it posits that linguistic categories and structures shape the way people view the world. [[Stanley Fish]] has defended postmodernism and relativism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~ccps/rcq/Fish.pdf ''Don't Blame Relativism''] as "serious thought"&lt;/ref&gt;

These perspectives do not strictly count as relativist in the philosophical sense, because they express agnosticism on the nature of reality and make [[epistemological]] rather than [[ontological]] claims. Nevertheless, the term is useful to differentiate them from [[Philosophical realism|realists]] who believe that the purpose of philosophy, science, or literary critique is to locate externally true meanings. Important philosophers and theorists such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Max Stirner]], political movements such as [[post-anarchism]] or [[post-Marxism]] can also be considered as relativist in this sense - though a better term might be [[social constructivist]].

The spread and popularity of this kind of "soft" relativism varies between academic disciplines. It has wide support in [[anthropology]] and has a majority following in cultural studies. It also has advocates in political theory and political science, sociology, and [[continental philosophy]] (as distinct from Anglo-American analytical philosophy). It has inspired empirical studies of the social construction of meaning such as those associated with labelling theory, which defenders can point to as evidence of the validity of their theories (albeit risking accusations of [[performative contradiction]] in the process). Advocates of this kind of relativism often also claim that recent developments in the natural sciences, such as Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[chaos theory]] and [[Complex systems|complexity theory]] show that science is now becoming relativistic. However, many scientists who use these methods continue to identify as realist or [[post-positivist]], and some sharply criticize the association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/ Sokal and the Science Wars]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/quantum_quackery/ Quantum quackery]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related and contrasting positions==
[[Relational theory|Relationism]] is the theory that there are only relations between individual entities, and no intrinsic
properties. Despite the similarity in name, it is held by some to be a position distinct from relativism—for instance, because "statements about relational properties [...] assert an absolute truth about things in the world".&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Baghramian|Baghramian, M.]] ''Relativism'', 2004, p43&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, others wish to equate relativism, relationism and even [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], which is a precise theory of relationships between physical objects:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nakedpunch.com/6/106-108.pdf Interview with Bruno Latour''On Relativism, Pragmatism, and Critical Theory'']&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, "This confluence of relativity theory with relativism became a strong contributing factor in the increasing prominence of relativism".&lt;ref&gt;Baghramian, M. ''Relativism'', 2004, p85&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas previous investigations of science only sought sociological or psychological explanations of failed scientific theories or pathological science, the '[[strong programme]]' is more relativistic, assessing scientific truth and falsehood equally in a historic and cultural context.

Relativism is not [[skepticism]], which superficially resembles relativism, because they both doubt absolute notions of truth. However, whereas skeptics go on to doubt all notions of truth, relativists replace absolute truth with a positive theory of many equally valid relative truths. For the relativist, there is no more to
truth than the right context, or the right personal or cultural belief, so there is a lot of truth in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/~allenw/webpapers/Relativism.doc Wood. A, ''Relativism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholic Church and relativism==
The [[Catholic Church]], especially under [[John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI]], has identified relativism as one of the most significant problems for faith and morals today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/wyd082105.htm World Youth Day News August August 21, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Church and to some theologians, relativism, as a denial of absolute truth, leads to moral license and a denial of the possibility of [[sin]] and of [[God]]. Whether moral or epistemological, relativism constitutes a denial of the capacity of the human mind and reason to arrive at truth. Truth, according to Catholic theologians and philosophers (following Aristotle) consists of ''adequatio rei et intellectus'', the [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]] of the mind and reality. Another way of putting it states that the [[mind]] has the same form as reality. This means when the form of the computer in front of someone (the type, color, shape, capacity, etc.) is also the form that is in their mind, then what they know is true because their mind corresponds to objective reality.

The denial of an absolute reference, of an ''axis mundi,'' denies God, who equates to Absolute Truth, according to these Christian theologians. They link relativism to [[secularism]], an obstruction of religion in [[human condition|human life.]]

===Leo XIII===
[[Pope Leo XIII]] (1810–1903) was the first known Pope to use the word relativism in the encyclical ''[[Humanum genus]]'' (1884). Leo XIII condemned [[Freemasonry]] and claimed that its philosophical and political system was largely based on relativism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_18840420_humanum-genus_it.html Humanum genus]&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Paul II===
[[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] in ''[[Veritatis Splendor]]''

:As is immediately evident, the crisis of truth is not unconnected with this development. Once the idea of a universal truth about the good, knowable by human reason, is lost, inevitably the notion of conscience also changes. Conscience is no longer considered in its primordial reality as an act of a person's intelligence, the function of which is to apply the universal knowledge of the good in a specific situation and thus to express a judgment about the right conduct to be chosen here and now. Instead, there is a tendency to grant to the individual conscience the prerogative of independently determining the criteria of good and evil and then acting accordingly. Such an outlook is quite congenial to an individualist ethic, wherein each individual is faced with his own truth, different from the truth of others. Taken to its extreme consequences, this individualism leads to a denial of the very idea of human nature.

In ''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'' (The Gospel of Life), he says:

:Freedom negates and destroys itself, and becomes a factor leading to the destruction of others, when it no longer recognizes and respects its essential link with the truth. When freedom, out of a desire to emancipate itself from all forms of tradition and authority, shuts out even the most obvious evidence of an objective and universal truth, which is the foundation of personal and social life, then the person ends up by no longer taking as the sole and indisputable point of reference for his own choices the truth about good and evil, but only his subjective and changeable opinion or, indeed, his selfish interest and whim.

===Benedict XVI===
In April 2005, in his homily&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/gpII/documents/homily-pro-eligendo-pontifice_20050418_en.html Mass «Pro Eligendo Romano Pontifice»: Homily of Card. Joseph Ratzinger&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; during Mass prior to the conclave which would elect him as [[Pope]], then [[Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]] talked about the world "moving towards a dictatorship of relativism":

:How many winds of doctrine we have known in recent decades, how many ideological currents, how many ways of thinking. The small boat of thought of many Christians has often been tossed about by these waves – thrown from one extreme to the other: from Marxism to liberalism, even to libertinism; from collectivism to radical individualism; from atheism to a vague religious mysticism; from agnosticism to syncretism, and so forth. Every day new sects are created and what [[Saint Paul]] says about human trickery comes true, with cunning which tries to draw those into error (cf [[Ephesians]] 4, 14). Having a clear Faith, based on the Creed of the Church, is often labeled today as a fundamentalism. Whereas, relativism, which is letting oneself be tossed and "swept along by every wind of teaching", looks like the only attitude acceptable to today's standards. We are moving towards a dictatorship of relativism which does not recognize anything as certain and which has as its highest goal one's own ego and one's own desires. However, we have a different goal: the Son of God, true man. He is the measure of true humanism. Being an "Adult" means having a faith which does not follow the waves of today's fashions or the latest novelties. A faith which is deeply rooted in friendship with [[Christ]] is adult and mature. It is this friendship which opens us up to all that is good and gives us the knowledge to judge true from false, and deceit from truth.

On June 6, 2005, Pope Benedict XVI told educators:

:Today, a particularly insidious obstacle to the task of education is the massive presence in our society and culture of that relativism which, recognizing nothing as definitive, leaves as the ultimate criterion only the self with its desires. And under the semblance of freedom it becomes a prison for each one, for it separates people from one another, locking each person into his or her own 'ego'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/june/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050606_convegno-famiglia_en.html Inaugural Address at the Ecclesial Diocesan Convention of Rome&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Then during the [[World Youth Day 2005|World Youth Day]] in August 2005, he also traced to relativism the problems produced by the communist and sexual revolutions, and provided a counter-counter argument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/august/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050820_vigil-wyd_en.html 20th World Youth Day - Cologne - Marienfeld, Youth Vigil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

:In the last century we experienced revolutions with a common programme–expecting nothing more from God, they assumed total responsibility for the cause of the world in order to change it. And this, as we saw, meant that a human and partial point of view was always taken as an absolute guiding principle. Absolutizing what is not absolute but relative is called totalitarianism. It does not liberate man, but takes away his dignity and enslaves him. It is not ideologies that save the world, but only a return to the living God, our Creator, the Guarantor of our freedom, the Guarantor of what is really good and true.

==Criticisms==
{{anchor|paradox_of_relativism}}A common argument&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/education/views/reality.htm Craig Rusbult. ''Reality 101'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Dixon. ''Is Cultural Relativism Self-Refuting''? (British Journal of Sociology, vol 28, No. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/cultural-relativism.htm ''Cultural Relativism'' at All About Philosophy.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friesian.com/relative.htm The Friesian School on relativism.]&lt;/ref&gt; against relativism suggests that it inherently [[self-refuting idea|contradicts, refutes, or stultifies itself]]: the statement "all is relative" classes either as a relative statement or as an absolute one. If it is relative, then this statement does not rule out absolutes. If the statement is [[wikt:absolute|absolute]], on the other hand, then it provides an example of an absolute statement, proving that not all truths are relative. However, this argument against relativism only applies to relativism that positions truth as relative–i.e. epistemological/truth-value relativism. More specifically, it is only extreme forms of epistemological relativism that can come in for this criticism as there are many epistemological relativists{{Who|date=July 2015}} who posit that some aspects of what is regarded as factually "true" are not universal, yet still accept that other universal truths exist (e.g. [[gas laws]] or moral laws).

Another argument against relativism posits a [[Natural Law]]. Simply put, the physical universe works under basic principles: the "Laws of Nature". Some contend that a natural Moral Law may also exist, for example as argued by [[Richard Dawkins]] in ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;[[The God Delusion]], Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; and addressed by [[C. S. Lewis]] in "[[Mere Christianity]]" (1952).&lt;ref&gt;[[Mere Christianity]], Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins said "I think we face an equal but much more sinister challenge from the left, in the shape of cultural relativism - the view that scientific truth is only one kind of truth and it is not to be especially privileged".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/28/dawkinschristmascardlist Richard Dawkins quoted in ''Dawkins' Christmas card list; Dawkins at the Hay Festival,'' The Guardian, 28 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Forced to exclude this too - it hangs. --&gt;&lt;!--[[Plato]] opposed relativism. He criticized the views of the [[sophist]] [[Protagoras]] in his dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Thaetetus]]''.  In a paraphrased dialogue, the philosopher [[Socrates]] argued that relativism is self-defeating with the following: "My opinion is: Truth must be absolute and that you Mr. Protagoras, are absolutely in error.  Since this is indeed my opinion, then you must concede that it is true according to your philosophy."&lt;ref name=socratesdialogue/&gt;
must be absolute and that you Mr. Protagoras, are absolutely in error.  Since this is indeed my opinion, then you must concede that it is true according to your philosophy."&lt;ref name=socratesdialogue/&gt;--&gt;&lt;!-- Quite a mess. (Plato could be o'k, but 1) make it chronologically, 2) make it clear.) --&gt;&lt;!-- "In Defense of Relativity." claims that Protagoras had but to respond, “but my view says that truth is relative to viewpoint, thus you have demonstrated by your very viewpoint that truth is relative,” and thus demonstrated the “truth” that truth is relative."  It goes further to state that "Socrates declared that (from his view), Protagoras’ idea of relative truth is wrong, thus it is wrong relative to Socrates' view.  Protagoras merely needed to respond that from his view, truth is relative to viewpoint, his statement is therefore true from his viewpoint and false from Socrates’ viewpoint, denoting the relative truths found in their respective relative views, and thus demonstrating the relative truth of Protagoras..." --&gt; &lt;!-- See above. --&gt; &lt;!-- Would you mind not corrupting other text next time? Etc. --&gt;
Philosopher [[Hilary Putnam]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Baghramian|Baghramian, M.]] ''Relativism'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; among others,&lt;ref&gt;Including Julien Beillard, who presents his case on the impossibility of moral relativism in the July 2013 issue of [[Philosophy Now|Philosophy Now magazine]], accessible [http://philosophynow.org/issues/97/Moral_Relativism_Is_Unintelligible here]&lt;/ref&gt; states that some forms of relativism make it impossible to believe one is in error. If there is no truth beyond an individual's [[belief]] that something is true, then an individual cannot hold their own beliefs to be false or mistaken. A related criticism is that relativizing truth to individuals destroys the distinction between truth and belief.

==Views==

===Indian religions===
[[Indian religions]] tend to view the perceivable universe and cosmos as relativistic.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} [[Mahavira]] (599-527 BC), the 24th [[Tirthankara]] of [[Jainism]], developed an early philosophy regarding relativism and [[subjectivism]] known as [[Anekantavada]]. [[Hinduism|Hindu religion]] has no theological difficulties in accepting degrees of truth in other religions. A [[Rig Veda|Rig Vedic]] hymn states that "Truth is One, though the sages tell it variously." (Ékam sat vipra bahudā vadanti)

[[Madhyamaka|Madhyamaka Buddhism]], which forms the basis for many [[Mahayana]] Buddhist schools and was founded by [[Nagarjuna]], discerns two levels of truth, absolute and relative. The [[two truths doctrine]] states that there is ''Relative'' or common-sense truth, which describes our daily experience of a concrete world, and ''Ultimate'' truth, which describes the ultimate reality as [[sunyata]], empty of concrete and inherent characteristics. The conventional truth may be interpreted as "obscurative truth" or "that which obscures the true nature" as a result. It is constituted by the appearances of mistaken awareness. Conventional truth would be the appearance that includes a duality of apprehender and apprehended, and objects perceived within that. Ultimate truths, are phenomena free from the duality of apprehender and apprehended.&lt;ref name="LevinsonAug06"&gt;Levinson, Jules (August 2006) ''[http://www.berotsana.org/pdf/lotsawa_timesII_sc.pdf Lotsawa Times Volume II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724083326/http://www.berotsana.org/pdf/lotsawa_timesII_sc.pdf |date=2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sikhism]] the [[Sikh Gurus|Gurus]] (spiritual teacher ) have propagated the message of "many paths" leading to the [[Ek Onkar|one God]] and ultimate [[salvation]] for all souls who tread on the path of [[righteousness]]. They have supported the view that proponents of all faiths can, by doing good and virtuous deeds and by remembering the [[Lord]], certainly achieve salvation. The students of the Sikh faith are told to accept all leading faiths as possible vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment provided the faithful study, ponder and practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. The holy book of the [[Sikh]]s called the [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]] says: "Do not say that the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran are false. Those who do not contemplate them are false." [[Guru Granth Sahib]] page 1350;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=1350&amp;english=t&amp;id=57718 Guru Granth Sahib page 1350]&lt;/ref&gt; later stating "The seconds, minutes, and hours, days, weeks and months, and the various seasons originate from the one Sun; O nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate from the Creator." [[Guru Granth Sahib]] page 12,13.

===Sophists===
[[Sophists]] are considered the founding fathers of relativism in the [[Western World]]. Elements of relativism emerged among the [[Sophist]]s in the 5th century [[Before Christ|BC]]. Notably, it was [[Protagoras]] who coined the phrase, "Man is the measure of all things: of things which are, that they are, and of things which are not, that they are not." The thinking of the Sophists is mainly known through their opponents, [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]].  In a well known paraphrased dialogue with Socrates, Protagoras said: "What is true for you is true for you, and what is true for me is true for me."&lt;ref name=socratesdialogue&gt;

===Bernard Crick===
Another important advocate of relativism, [[Bernard Crick]], a British political scientist, wrote the book ''In Defence of Politics'' (first published in 1962), suggesting the inevitability of moral conflict between people. Crick stated that only [[ethics]] could resolve such conflict, and when that occurred in public it resulted in [[politics]]. Accordingly, Crick saw the process of [[dispute resolution]], [[harms reduction]], [[mediation]] or [[peacemaking]] as central to all of moral philosophy. He became an important influence on the [[feminists]] and later on the [[Green movement|Greens]].

===Paul Feyerabend===
The philosopher of science [[Paul Feyerabend]] is often considered to be a relativist, though he denied being one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=156973&amp;sectioncode=39 Cooper, David E., "Voodoo and the monster of science," ''Times Higher Education'', 17 March 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

Feyerabend argued that modern science suffers from being methodologically monistic (the belief that only a single methodology can produce [[scientific progress]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Elisabeth. "Feyerabend, Mill, and Pluralism", ''Philosophy of Science'' 64, p. S397.&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend summarises his case in his work [[Against Method]] with the phrase "anything goes".&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, ''Against Method'', 3rd ed., p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

: In an aphorism [Feyerabend] often repeated, "potentially every culture is all cultures". This is intended to convey that world views are not hermetically closed, since their leading concepts have an "ambiguity" - better, an open-endedness - which enables people from other cultures to engage with them. [...] It follows that relativism, understood as the doctrine that truth is relative to closed systems, can get no purchase.  [...] For Feyerabend, both hermetic relativism and its absolutist rival [realism] serve, in their different ways, to "devalue human existence". The former encourages that unsavoury brand of political correctness which takes the refusal to criticise "other cultures" to the extreme of condoning murderous dictatorship and barbaric practices. The latter, especially in its favoured contemporary form of "scientific realism", with the excessive prestige it affords to the abstractions of "the monster 'science'", is in bed with a politics which likewise disdains variety, richness and everyday individuality - a politics which likewise "hides" its norms behind allegedly neutral facts, "blunts choices and imposes laws".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=156973&amp;sectioncode=39 Cooper, David E., "Voodoo and the monster of science," ''Times Higher Education'', 17 March 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Kuhn===
[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]]'s philosophy of science, as expressed in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' is often interpreted as relativistic. He claimed that as well as progressing steadily and incrementally ("[[normal science]]"), science undergoes periodic revolutions or "[[paradigm shift]]s", leaving scientists working in different paradigms with difficulty in even communicating. Thus the truth of a claim, or the existence of a posited entity is relative to the paradigm employed. However, it isn't necessary for him to embrace relativism because every paradigm presupposes the prior, building upon itself through history and so on. This leads to there being a fundamental, incremental, and referential structure of development which is not relative but again, fundamental.

:From these remarks, one thing is however certain: Kuhn is not saying that incommensurable theories cannot be compared - what they can’t be is compared in terms of a system of common measure. He very plainly says that they can be compared, and he reiterates this repeatedly in later work, in a (mostly in vain) effort to avert the crude and sometimes catastrophic misinterpretations he suffered from mainstream philosophers and post-modern relativists alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uea.ac.uk/~j339/Kuhntogo.htm Sharrock. W., Read R. ''Kuhn: Philosopher of Scientific Revolutions'']&lt;/ref&gt;

But Thomas Kuhn denied the accusation of being a relativist later in his postscript.

: scientific development is ... a unidirectional and irreversible process. Latter scientific theories are better than earlier ones for solving puzzles ... That is not a relativist's position, and it displays the sense in which I am a convinced believer in scientific progress.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that one can also read Kuhn's work as essentially positivist in its ontology: the revolutions he posits are epistemological, lurching toward a presumably 'better' understanding of an objective reality through the lens presented by the new paradigm. However, a number of passages in Structures do indeed appear to be distinctly relativist, and to directly challenge the notion of an objective reality and the ability of science to progress towards an ever-greater grasp of it, particularly through the process of paradigm change.

: In the sciences there need not be progress of another sort. We may, to be more precise, have to relinquish the notion, explicit or implicit, that changes of paradigm carry scientists and those who learn from them closer and closer to the truth.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

: We are all deeply accustomed to seeing science as the one enterprise that draws constantly nearer to some goal set by nature in advance. But need there be any such goal? Can we not account for both science’s existence and its success in terms of evolution from the community’s state of knowledge at any given time? Does it really help to imagine that there is some one full, objective, true account of nature and that the proper measure of scientific achievement is the extent to which it brings us closer to that ultimate goal?&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', p. 171.&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Lakoff and Mark Johnson===
[[George Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] define relativism in their book ''[[Metaphors We Live By]]'' as the rejection of both [[subject (philosophy)|subjectivism]] and [[Metaphysical realism|metaphysical objectivism]] in order to focus on the relationship between them, i.e. the [[metaphors|metaphor]] by which we relate our current experience to our previous experience. In particular, Lakoff and Johnson characterize "objectivism" as a "[[straw man]]", and, to a lesser degree, criticize the views of [[Karl Popper]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Aristotle]].{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

===Robert Nozick===
In his book ''[[Invariances]]'', [[Robert Nozick]] expresses a complex set of theories about the absolute and the relative. He thinks the absolute/relative distinction should be recast in terms of an invariant/variant distinction, where there are many things a proposition can be invariant with regard to or vary with. He thinks it is coherent for truth to be relative, and speculates that it might vary with time. He thinks necessity is an unobtainable notion, but can be approximated by robust invariance across a variety of conditions—although we can never identify a proposition that is invariant with regard to everything. Finally, he is not particularly warm to one of the most famous forms of relativism, [[moral relativism]], preferring an evolutionary account.

===Joseph Margolis===
[[Joseph Margolis]] advocates a view he calls "robust relativism" and defends it in his books: ''Historied Thought, Constructed World'', Chapter 4 (California, 1995) and ''The Truth about Relativism'' (Blackwells, 1991). He opens his account by stating that our logics should depend on what we take to be the nature of the sphere to which we wish to apply our logics. Holding that there can be no distinctions which are not "privileged" between the [[alethic possibility|alethic]], the [[ontic]], and the [[epistemic]], he maintains that a [[many valued logic]] just might be the most apt for [[aesthetics]] or [[history]] since, because in these practices, we are loath to hold to simple [[Principle of bivalence|binary logic]]; and he also holds that many-valued logic is relativistic. (This is perhaps an unusual definition of "relativistic". Compare with his comments on "relationism"). "True" and "False" as mutually exclusive and exhaustive judgements on [[Hamlet]], for instance, really does seem absurd. A many valued logic—"apt", "reasonable", "likely", and so on—seems intuitively more applicable to Hamlet interpretation. Where apparent contradictions arise between such interpretations, we might call the interpretations "incongruent", rather than dubbing either "false", because using many-valued logic implies that a measured value is a mixture of two extreme possibilities. Using the subset of many-valued logic, [[fuzzy logic]], it can be said that various interpretations can be represented by membership in more than one possible truth sets simultaneously. Fuzzy logic is therefore probably the best mathematical structure for understanding "robust relativism" and has been interpreted by [[Bart Kosko]] as philosophically being related to Zen Buddhism.

It was [[Aristotle]] who held that relativism implied we should, sticking with appearances only, end up contradicting ourselves somewhere if we could apply all attributes to all ''ousiai'' ([[being]]s). Aristotle, however, made non-contradiction dependent upon his [[essentialism]]. If his essentialism is false, then so too is his ground for disallowing relativism. (Subsequent philosophers have found other reasons for supporting the principle of non-contradiction).{{clarify|date=December 2012}}

Beginning with [[Protagoras]] and invoking [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], Margolis shows that the historic struggle to discredit relativism is an attempt to impose an unexamined belief in the world's essentially rigid rule-like nature. Plato and Aristotle merely attacked "relationalism"—the doctrine of true-for l or true for k, and the like, where l and k are different speakers or different worlds, or the something similar (Most philosophers would call this position "relativism"). For Margolis, "true" means true; that is, the alethic use of "true" remains untouched. However, in real world contexts, and context is ubiquitous in the real world, we must apply truth values. Here, in epistemic terms, we{{Who|date=July 2011}} might retire "true" ''tout court'' as an evaluation and keep "false". The rest of our value-judgements could be graded from "extremely plausible" down to "false". Judgements which on a bivalent logic would be incompatible or contradictory are further seen as "incongruent", though one may well have more weight than the other. In short, relativistic logic is not, or need not be, the bugbear it is often presented to be. It may simply be the best type of logic to apply to certain very uncertain spheres of real experiences in the world (although some sort of logic needs to be applied to make that judgement). Those who swear by [[bivalent logic|bivalent]] logic might simply be the ultimate keepers of the great fear of the flux.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Richard Rorty===
Philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] has a somewhat [[paradox]]ical role in the debate over relativism: he is criticized for his relativistic views by many commentators, but has always denied that relativism applies to much anybody, being nothing more than a Platonic scarecrow.  Rorty claims, rather, that he is a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]], and that to construe pragmatism as relativism is to [[beg the question]].

:'"Relativism" is the traditional epithet applied to pragmatism by realists'&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R. ''Consequences of Pragmatism''&lt;/ref&gt;

:'"Relativism" is the view that every belief on a certain topic, or perhaps about any topic, is as good as every other. No one holds this view. Except for the occasional cooperative freshman, one cannot find anybody who says that two incompatible opinions on an important topic are equally good. The philosophers who get called 'relativists' are those who say that the grounds for choosing between such opinions are less algorithmic than had been thought.'&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rorty, ''Pragmatism, Relativism, and Irrationalism''&lt;/ref&gt;

:'In short, my strategy for escaping the self-referential difficulties into which "the Relativist" keeps getting himself is to move everything over from epistemology and metaphysics into cultural politics, from claims to knowledge and appeals to self-evidence to suggestions about what we should try.'&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R. ''Hilary Putnam and the Relativist Menace''&lt;/ref&gt;

Rorty takes a [[Deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]] attitude to [[truth]], believing there is nothing of interest to be said about truth in general, including the contention that it is generally subjective. He also argues that the notion of [[Theory of justification|warrant]] or justification can do most of the work traditionally assigned to the concept of truth, and that justification ''is'' relative; justification is justification to an audience, for Rorty.

In ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'' he argues that the debate between so-called relativists and so-called objectivists is beside the point because they don't have enough premises in common for either side to prove anything to the other.

===Isaiah Berlin===
The late Sir [[Isaiah Berlin]] expressed a relativistic view when he stated that, to "confuse our own constructions with eternal laws or divine decrees is one of the most fatal delusions of men."&lt;ref&gt;Sir Isaiah Berlin, ''Against the Current: Essays in the History of Ideas,'' London: Pimlico, 1997, p.303&lt;/ref&gt; And again when he said, "the concept of fact is itself problematic…all facts embody theories...or socially conditioned, ideological attitudes."&lt;ref&gt;Sir Isaiah Berlin, 'Alleged Relativism in Eighteenth Century Thought,' in ''The Crooked Timber of Humanity,'' Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1999, p.89&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shiwu''' (石屋, Wade–Giles: Shih-Wu) or '''Stonehouse''' (1272–1352) was a [[China|Chinese]] [[Zen|Chan]] [[poet]] and [[hermit]] who lived during the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. 
Shiwu was born in the town of [[Changshu]]. Taking his name from the Shihwutung (Stonehouse cave) in [[Yushan County|Yushan]]. In 1292 Shiwu became a novice at Yushan's [[Hsingfu temple]], a major monastic center at the time. He studied under master Yung-Wei and three years later was ordained and received the [[dharma name]] Ch'ing-hung.&lt;ref&gt;''The Zen Works of Stonehouse: Poems and Talks of a 14th-Century Chinese Hermit'', Red Pine, 1999, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==
He is said to have followed a monk to the Tianmu Mountains to meet with Chan master Kao-Feng. On his arrival Kao-feng asked why he came to his hermitage to which Shiwu answered "I've come for the [[Dharma]]". 

Kao-feng said "The Dharma isn't so easy to find. You've got to burn your fingers for incense". 

Shiwu replied "But I see the Master before me with my own eyes. How could the Dharma be hidden?". 

Kao-feng took him as his pupil and gave him the [[koan]] "All things return to one" for study.&lt;ref&gt;''The Zen Works of Stonehouse: Poems and Talks of a 14th-Century Chinese Hermit'', Red Pine, 1999, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chi-an===
After three years with little progress, Shiwu decided to leave and Kao-feng recommended he study under the Chan master Chi-an. Shiwu crossed the [[Yangtze]] and met Chi-an at West Peak Temple near Chienyang. 

Chi-an asked Shiwu what teaching he had received. 

Shiwu said, "All things return to one". 

Chi-an asked what it meant and Shiwu remained silent. 

Chi-an said "Those words are dead. Where did you pick up such rot?". 

Shiwu bowed and asked for instruction. 

Chi-an then gave him another koan: "Where buddhas dwell, don't stop. Where buddhas don't dwell, hurry past". 

Shiwu said he didn't understand but decided to stay with Chi-an.&lt;ref&gt;''The Zen Works of Stonehouse: Poems and Talks of a 14th-Century Chinese Hermit'', Red Pine, 1999, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; 

One day, Chi-an asked once more about the koan and Shiwu answered, "When you mount the horse, you see the road". 

Chi-an admonished him once again. 

Shiwu left but on his way down the mountain he saw a [[pavilion]] and had a sudden insight. He turned back and told Chi-an, "Where buddhas dwell, don't stop. Those are dead words. Where buddhas don't dwell, hurry past. Those are dead words too. Now I understand living words".

Chi-an asked him what he understood and Shiwu answered, "When the rain finally stops in late spring, the oriole appears on a branch"&lt;ref&gt;(cf. Confucius says, "When the oriole rests, it knows where to rest. Is it possible man isn't equal to this bird?" - Dà Xué 3.2).''The Zen Works of Stonehouse: Poems and Talks of a 14th-Century Chinese Hermit'', Red Pine, 1999, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chi-an later served as abbot of the Taochang temple and Shiwu joined him. Shiwu also served as a meditation teacher in [[Lingyin temple]]. 

===Poet===
In 1312 at the age of forty he moved to Xiamu Mountain near Huzhou to live as a hermit and it is here that he composed his "Mountain Poems" (Shan-shih), one-hundred and eighty-four verses mostly dealing with life in the mountains. In the preface to the Mountain poems, Shiwu writes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here in the woods I have lots of free time. When I don't spend it sleeping, I enjoy composing gathas. But with paper and ink so scarce, I haven't thought of writing them down. Now some Zen monks have asked me to record what I find of interest on this mountain. I've sat here quietly and let my brush fly. Suddenly, this volume is full. I close it and sent it back down with the admonition not to try singing these poems. Only if you sit on them will they do you any good.&lt;ref&gt;''The Zen Works of Stonehouse: Poems and Talks of a 14th-Century Chinese Hermit'', Red Pine, 1999, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The opening poem of the Shan-Shi describes the natural setting of his hermitage: 

:I made my home west of the Sha
:where water fills Sky Lake and the moon fills the river
:people are frightened when they see the heights
:but once they arrive they know the trail
:dried snail shells on rock walls
:fresh tiger tracks in the mud
:my door stays open when spring days grow long
:when paulownias bloom and cicadas call

Many of his poems deal with the mundane facets of everyday hermit life. 

:I don't stop moving all day
:long before sunset I'm done
:back home I wash off my feet and sleep
:too tired to notice the mountain moon's passage
:birds wake me up from a distant grove
:the red sun's disc shines through the pines
:today and tomorrow don't differ
:the years are all the same.

Some of the poems also focus on Zen Buddhist philosophical ideals like [[impermanence]] and [[Nekkhamma|non-attachment]].

:This body's existence is like a bubble's
:may as well accept what happens
:events and hopes seldom agree
:but who can step back doesn't worry
:we blossom and fade like flowers
:gather and part like clouds
:worldly thoughts I forgot long ago
:relaxing all day on a peak.

==Reception==

'''Simon Glendinning''' (born 1964) is an English philosopher, and is currently Professor of European Philosophy in the European Institute at the [[London School of Economics]]. He is Director of the [[Forum for European Philosophy]].

His father was the [[Goya]] specialist, Nigel Glendinning. His mother is the author, [[Victoria Glendinning]]. He is the youngest of four brothers. The eldest, Paul Glendinning, is a mathematician at the [[University of Manchester]]. The second is the photographer, Hugo Glendinning and the third is sports journalist, Matthew Glendinning. He lives in [[Henley-on-Thames]] in Oxfordshire, and is father of three children.

In January 2015 Glendinning was a guest on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[In Our Time (radio series)|In Our Time]]'', which discussed [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04ykk4m]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Glendinning studied philosophy at the [[University of Oxford]] and at the [[University of York]], since which he has held a series of positions:
* 1993–1997: Lecturer, Department of Philosophy, [[University of Kent]]
* 1997–2004: Senior Lecturer, Department of Philosophy, [[University of Reading]]
* 2004–2013: Reader in European Philosophy, European Institute, [[London School of Economics|LSE]]
* 2014–present: Professor of European Philosophy, European Institute, LSE

==Philosophical work==
Glendinning's work is characterised by the way in which it engages with thinkers and themes from both the 'analytic' and 'continental' traditions in philosophy. His first book, ''On Being With Others: Heidegger-Wittgenstein-Derrida'', is an analysis of the problem of other minds. His later writings are largely concerned with the phenomenological tradition in philosophy. ''In the Name of Phenomenology'' is a detailed study of that tradition. ''The Idea of Continental Philosophy'' is a critique of the contemporary division between ‘analytic’ and ‘continental’ philosophy, and argues that phenomenological philosophy in particular should not be conceived as an exclusively ‘continental’ tradition. In 2011 he published ''Derrida: A Very Short Introduction''. However, most of his work since 2007 has involved a turn from European Philosophy towards the Philosophy of Europe.

'''Stephen P. Stich''' (born May 9, 1943) is a professor of [[Philosophy]] and [[Cognitive science|Cognitive Science]] at [[Rutgers University]], as well as an Honorary Professor in Philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]]. Stich's main philosophical interests are in the [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], and [[moral psychology]]. His 1983 book, ''From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science: The Case Against Belief'', received much attention as he argued for a form of [[eliminative materialism]] about the mind. He changed his mind, in later years, as indicated in his 1996 book ''Deconstructing the Mind''.

==Education and career==
Stich was an undergraduate at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] from 1960–1964 where he was a member of the [[Philomathean Society]]. He received his BA in 1964 (Summa Cum Laude with distinction in Philosophy). He did graduate work at [[Princeton University]] from 1964–1968, he received his PhD in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Background education information from [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~stich/CV/CV_SPS.pdf Stich's curriculum vitae (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123223842/http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~stich/CV/CV_SPS.pdf |date=2005-11-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has held teaching positions at [[University of Michigan]], [[University of Maryland, College Park]], [[University of California, San Diego]], [[University of Sheffield]], and [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~stich/CV/CV%20-%20SPS%20-%20updated%2011-09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Stich joined the [[University of Sheffield]] as an honorary professor in their philosophy department in February 2005. He remains primarily at Rutgers, but visits Sheffield periodically, where he teaches and works at the Hang Seng Centre for Cognitive Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Information from [http://www.shef.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/profiles/stich.html Stich's profile at University of Sheffield].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 he was awarded the [[Jean Nicod Prize]] and gave a series of lectures in Paris titled ''Moral Theory Meets Cognitive Science: How the Cognitive Science Can Transform Traditional Debates''.&lt;ref&gt;Archives Audiovisuelles de la Recherche, [http://www.archivesaudiovisuelles.fr/974/ Stephen Stich, Moral Theory Meets Cognitive Science: How the Cognitive Science Can Transform Traditional Debates] (full video coverage)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sas.rutgers.edu/office-of-the-dean/office-of-administration/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
Stich is primarily known in philosophy for his work in the [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive science]], [[epistemology]], and [[moral psychology]].  In philosophy of mind and cognitive science, Stich (1983) has argued for a form of [[eliminative materialism]]&amp;mdash;the view that talk of the mental should be replaced with talk of its physical substrate.  Since then, however, he has changed some of his views on the mind. See ''[[Deconstructing the Mind]]'' (1996) for his more recent views. In epistemology, he has explored (with several of his colleagues) the nature of intuitions using the techniques of [[experimental philosophy]], especially epistemic intuitions that vary among cultures&amp;mdash;see Stich (1988) and Stich, et al. (2001).  This work reflects a general skepticism about [[conceptual analysis]] and the traditional methods of analytic philosophy. In ''The Fragmentation of Reason'' he briefly sketched a form of epistemic relativism "in the spirit of [[pragmatism]]."&lt;ref&gt;Ch. 6 p.129 of The Fragmentation of Reason: Preface to a Pragmatic Theory of Cognitive Evaluation&lt;/ref&gt;

He and [[Shaun Nichols]] are responsible for a theory of how humans understand the mental states of ourselves and others, or [[Theory of mind|mindreading]], which they present in Nichols and Stich (2003).  Their theory is a hybrid, containing elements of both the [[simulation theory]] and [[theory theory]], and also aims to explain the mental architecture that enables pretence.

'''''The Grammar of Science''''' is a book by [[Karl Pearson]] first published in hardback in 1892. In 1900, the second edition, published by Adam &amp; Charles Black, appeared. The third, revised, edition was also published by Adam &amp; Charles Black in 1911. It was recommended by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] to his friends of the [[Olympia Academy]]. Several themes were covered in this book that later became part of the theories of Einstein and other scientists, such as:
* the [[Galilean relativity|relativity]] of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] to a frame of reference (fixed stars),
* the equivalence of "[[matter]]" and [[energy]],
* [[physics]] as [[geometry]],
* the non-existence of the [[Aether (classical element)|ether]],
* the importance of creative imagination rather than mere fact-gathering,
* [[antimatter]], 
* [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]], 
* wrinkles in space,
* molecular relative position and motion, and
* motion of corpuscles as relative motion in a field.
 
==Chapter I==
''"Introductory - The Scope and Method of Science"''
# The scope of science is to ascertain truth in every possible branch of knowledge. There is no sphere of inquiry which lies outside the legitimate field of science. To draw a distinction between the scientific and philosophical fields is obfuscation.
# The scientific method has the following distinctive features:
::* (a) careful and accurate measurement of data, and "observation of their correlation and sequence"; 
::*(b) discovery of scientific laws by aid of the creative imagination; 
::*(c) self-criticism; 
::*(d) final decisions having equal validity for all normally constituted minds.
# The claims of science to our support depend on: 
::*(a) the efficient mental training it provides for the citizen; 
::*(b) the light it brings to bear on many important social problems; 
::*(c) the increased comfort it adds to practical life;
::*(d) the permanent gratification it yields to the aesthetic judgment.

==Chapter II==
"The Facts of Science"
# Immediate sense-impressions form permanent impresses in the brain which psychically correspond to memory. The union of immediate sense-impressions with associated stored impressions leads to the formation of "constructs," which we project "outside ourselves," and term phenomena or appearances. The real world lies for us in such phenomenal constructs and not in shadowy things-in-themselves. "Outside" and "inside" oneself are alike ultimately based on sense-impressions; but from these sense-impressions by association, mechanical and mental, we form conceptions and draw inferences. These are the facts of science, and its field is essentially the contents of the mind.
# When an interval elapses between sense-impression and muscular exertion, and the interval contains cerebral activity marking the revival and combination of past sense-impresses, we are said to think or be conscious. Consciousness of something external is an inference which, not yet having been verified by immediate sense-impression, we term an "eject;" it is conceivable, however, that it could become an object. Consciousness has no meaning other than to nervous systems akin to our own; it is illogical to assert that all matter is conscious, still more that consciousness or will can exist outside matter.
# The term knowledge is meaningless when extended beyond the sphere in which we may legitimately infer consciousness, or when applied to things outside the area of thought, i.e., to metaphysical terms dignified by the name of conceptions although they do not ultimately flow from sense-impressions.

==Chapter III==
"The Scientific Law"
# Scientific Law is of a totally different nature from civil law; it does not involve an intelligent lawgiver, a command and a corresponding duty. It is a brief description in mental shorthand of as wide a range as possible of the sequences of our sense-impressions.
# There are two distinct meanings to natural law: the mere routine of perception, and the scientific law or formula describing the field of nature. The "reason" in natural law is only obvious when we speak of law in the latter sense, and then it is really placed there by the human mind. Thus the supposed reason behind natural law does not enable us to pass from the routine of perceptions to anything of the nature of reason behind the world of sense-impression.
# The fact that the human reflective faculty is able to express the routine of perceptions in mental formulae may be due to this routine being a product of the perceptive faculty itself. The perceptive faculty appears to be selective and to have developed in co-ordination with the reflective faculty. Of the world outside sensation science can only logically infer chaos, or the absence of the conditions of knowledge; no human concept, such as order, reason, or consciousness, can be logically projected into it.

==Chapter IV==
"Cause and Effect - Probability" 
# Cause is scientifically used to denote an antecedent stage in a routine of perceptions. In this sense, "force" as a cause is meaningless. First cause is only a limit, permanent or temporary, to knowledge. No instance, certainly not "will," occurs in our experience of an arbitrary first cause in the popular sense of the word.
# There is no inherent necessity in the routine of perceptions, but the permanent existence of rational beings necessitates a routine of perceptions; the possibility of a thinking being ceases with the cessation of routine. The only necessity we are acquainted with exists in the sphere of conceptions; routine in perceptions may possibly be due to the constitution of the perceptive faculty.
# Proof in the field of perceptions is the demonstration of overwhelming probability. Logically we ought to use the word ''know'' only of conceptions, and reserve the word ''believe'' for perceptions. "I know that the angle at the circumference on any diameter of a circle is right," but "I believe that the sun will rise tomorrow." The proof that a breach of routine will not occur for a finite future depends upon the solid experience that we are ignorant only in areas in which, statistically, all constitutions of the unknown are found to be equally probable.

==Chapter V==
"Contingency and Correlation - The Insufficiency of Causation"
# Routine in perceptions is a relative term; the idea of causation is extracted by conceptual processes from phenomena, it is neither a [[logical truth|logical necessity]], nor an actual experience. We can merely classify things as like; we cannot reproduce sameness, but we can only measure how relatively like follows relatively like. The wider view of the universe sees all phenomena as correlated, but not causally related.
# Whether phenomena are qualitative or quantitative, a classification leads to a contingency table. From such a table we can measure the degree of dependence between any two phenomena. Causation is the limit to such a table, when it contains an indefinitely large number of "cells," but in each array only one such cell is occupied. Mathematical function arises when the belt of dots which are the actual result of all experience shrivels up into a curve. It is a purely conceptual limit which is just as much a conceptual limit to actual experience when we use a multiplicity of "causes."
# The intellectual gain of this contingency category lies in the fact that it sees variation as the fundamental factor in phenomena. Determinatism is the result of supposing "sameness" instead of a mere classificatory "likeness" in phenomena. Variation and correlation include causation and determinatism as special cases, if indeed they have any actual existence in regard to phenomena. No experience we have at present justifies us, however, in assuming them to be anything but conceptual limits created by human need for economy of thought, and as little inherent in phenomena themselves as geometrical surfaces or centres of force.

==Chapter VI==
"Space and Time"
# Space and time are not realities in the phenomenal world, but the modes under which we perceive things apart. They are not infinitely large nor infinitely divisible, but are essentially limited by the contents of our perception.
# Scientific concepts are, as a rule, limits drawn in conception to processes which can be started but not carried to a conclusion in perception. The historical origin of the concepts of geometry and physics can thus be traced. Concepts such as geometrical surface, atom, and ether, are not asserted by science to have a real existence in or behind phenomena, but are valid as shorthand methods of describing the correlation and sequence of phenomena. From this standpoint conceptual space and time can be easily appreciated, and the danger avoided of projecting their ideal infinities and eternities into the real world of perception.

==Chapter VII==
"The Geometry of Motion"
# All the notions by aid of which we describe and measure change are ''geometrical'', and thus are not real perceptual limits. They are forms distinguishing and classifying the contents of our personal experience under the mixed mode of motion. The principal forms are point-motion, spin of a rigid body, and strain. Motion is found to be relative, never absolute; for example, it is meaningless to speak of the motion of a point without reference to what system is related to the motion of the point.
# An analysis of point-motion leads us to the conceptions of velocity and acceleration. Velocity is a proper measure of the manner in which position is instantaeously changing. Acceleration is a proper measure of how velocity itself is an increased change. It is found that a motion is fully determined. Theoretically, a complete description of the path and position at each instant of time may be deduced when the velocity in any one position and the acceleration for all positions is given.
# The parallelogram law as the general rule for combining motions is the foundation of the synthesis by which complex motions are constructed out of simple motions.

==Chapter VIII==
"Matter"

The notion of matter is found to be equally obscure whether we seek for definition in the writings of physicists or of "common sense" philosophers. The difficulties with regard to it appear to arise from asserting the phenomenal but imperceptible existence of mere conceptual symbols. Change of sense-impression is the proper term for external perception. Motion is the proper term for our conceptual symbolisation of this change. Of perception the question "what moves" and "why it moves" are seen to be idle. In the field of conception, the moving bodies are geometrical ideals with merely descriptive motions.

In order to understand that we can perceive change of sense-impression but we can only conceive motion, three questions must be asked: ''"What moves? Why does it move? How does it move?"''. Science can only answer the question ''"How does it move?"''. The others are unintelligible, because we find that matter, force, and "action at a distance" are not terms which express real problems of the phenomenal world.

==Chapter IX==
"The Laws of Motion"

The physicist forms a conceptual model of the universe by the aid of corpuscles. These corpuscles are only symbols for the component parts of perceptual bodies and are not to be considered as in any way resembling definite perceptual equivalents. The corpuscles with which we have to deal are ether-element, prime-atom, atom, molecule, and particle. We conceive them to move in the manner which enables us most accurately to describe the sequences of our sense-impressions. This manner of motion is summed up in the so-called laws of motion. These laws hold in the first place for particles, but they have been frequently assumed to be true for all corpuscles. It is more reasonable, however, to conceive that a great part of mechanism flows from the structure of gross "matter."

The proper measure of mass is found to be a ratio of mutual accelerations, and force is seen to be a certain convenient measure of motion, and not its cause. The customary definitions of mass and force, as well as the Newtonian statement of the laws of motion, are shown to abound in metaphysical obscurities. It is also questionable whether the principles involved in the current statements as to the superposition and combination of forces are scientifically correct when applied to atoms and molecules. The hope for future progress lies in clearer conceptions of the nature of ether and of the structure of gross "matter."

The general laws of motion are expressed as extensions of Newton's Laws

First Law: "Every corpuscle in the conceptual model of the universe must be conceived as moving with due regard to the presence of every other corpuscle, although for very distant corpuscles the regard paid is extremely small as compared with that paid to immediate neighbours."

Second Law: "Principle of Inertia"

Third Law: "Mutual Acceleration is determined by Relative Position"

Fourth Law: "The ratio of the acceleration of A due to B to the acceleration of B due to A must always be considered to be the same whatever be the position of A and B, and whatever be the surrounding field"

Fifth Law: "The Definition of Force - The force of B on A is equal and opposite to the force of A on B"

==Chapter X==
"Modern Physical Ideas"

The development of physical science over the last twenty years has revealed phenomena which illustrate clearly the principles and method of the preceding chapters. The Newtonian scheme of dynamics has been shown to be an approximation valid only for gross matter and our gross senses. There is reasonable ground for supposing that an electro-magnetic scheme of the constitution of matter will prove far more comprehensive. But there are outstanding difficulties, notably that gravitation has so far defied all efforts to bring it into line with this scheme, and that no simple concept has yet been furnished to represent the positive electricity of experiment.

The principles of conservation of energy, momentum, and mass all become meaningless without an ether which is as much and as little a reality as matter, and then mass, energy, momentum, are quantities in the same category with force.

The constancy of the mass of a body in material dynamics, which is the whole experimental basis of that science, is replaced by the conception of all electrons of the same type (negative, possibly also positive) being identical in character.

The ether is a purely conceptual medium which, as far as theory is at present developed, is structureless except that at isolated points there exist centres at which its properties are exceptional. These centres, by their mutual motion and grouping, constitute the model of the sequence of natural phenomena.

New light is thrown on our conceptions of space and time. They are interdependent and conditioned by the phenomena which they are used to describe. The phrase "motion relative to the ether" becomes meaningless. The ether is becoming more and more clearly a concept in the mind of each observer.

[[File:Two-people-talking-logo.jpg|thumb|A black and white icon of two people talking to indicate discussion with one another]]

In [[spoken language]] analysis, an '''utterance''' is the smallest unit of [[speech communication|speech]]. It is a continuous piece of speech beginning and ending with a clear pause. In the case of [[oral language]]s, it is generally but not always bounded by silence. Utterances do not exist in written language, only their representations do. They can be represented and delineated in [[written language]] in many ways.

In oral/spoken language utterances have several features including paralinguistic features which are aspects of speech such as [[facial expression]], [[gesture]], and posture. Prosodic features include stress, intonation, and tone of voice, as well as [[ellipsis]], which are words that the listener inserts in spoken language to fill gaps. Moreover, other aspects of utterances found in spoken languages are non-fluency features including: voiced/un-voiced pauses (like "umm"), tag questions, and false starts when someone begins their utterances again to correct themselves. Other features include: fillers ("and stuff"); accent/dialect; deictic expressions, which are utterances like "over there!" which need further explanation to be understood; simple conjunctions ("and," "but," etc.); and colloquial lexis which are everyday informal words.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allinfo.org.uk/levelup/enb1.htm|title=Level Up: English Language|website=www.allinfo.org.uk|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utterances that are portrayed in writing are planned, in contrast to utterances in improvised spoken language. In written language there are frameworks that are used to portray this type of language. Discourse structure (which can also be found in spoken language) is how the conversation is organized, in which [[adjacency pairs]] - an utterance and the answer to that utterance - are used. [[Discourse marker]]s are used to organize conversation ("first," "secondly," etc.). [[Lexis (linguistics)|Lexis]] denotes the words being used in a text or spoken; these words can create a [[semantic field]]. For example, a semantic field of love can be created with lexical choices such as adore, admire, and care. Grammar/syntax is another feature of language in general but also utterances, and [[pragmatics]] means that when utterances are spoken or written the meaning is not literal, as in sarcasm.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;

== Characteristics/features ==
An utterance which is found in spoken and [[written language]] as in a [[Screenplay|script]] has several characteristics. These include paralinguistic features which is a feature of communication that doesn't involve words but is added around an utterance to give meaning. Examples of paralinguistic features include facial expressions, laughter, eye contact, and gestures. [[Prosodic]] features refer to the sound of someone's voice as they speak: pitch, [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and stress. Ellipsis can be used in either written or spoken language, when an utterance is conveyed and the speaker omits words because they are already understood in the situation. For example: A: Juice? B: Please. A: Room temperature? B: Cold.

Non-fluency features also occur when producing utterances. As people think about what to say to while speaking, there are errors and corrections in speech. For example, voiced/un-voiced pauses which are "umm," "erm," etc. in voiced pauses and in transcripts un-voiced pauses are denoted as (.) or (1) relating to the amount of time of the pause. [[Tag question]]s are also a part of non-fluency features; these are used by the speaker to check if the listener understands what the speaker is saying. An example is "Do you know what I mean?" False alerts occur when the speaker is voicing an utterance but stops and starts again, usually to correct themselves.

[[Filler (linguistics)|Fillers]] usually give the speaker time to think and gather their thoughts in order to continue their utterance; these include lexis such as, "like," "and stuff,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Candea|first=Maria|year=2005|title=Inter- and intra-language acoustic analysis of autonomous fillers|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00321914/document|journal=Hal|volume=|pages=47–52|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accent/dialect is also a characteristic included in utterances which is the way the words are voiced, the pronunciation and the different types of lexis used in different parts of the world. [[Deictic expression]]s are utterances that need more explanation in order to be understood, like: "Wow! Look over there!" Simple conjunctions in speech are words that connect other words like "and," "but," etc. Colloquial lexis is a type of speech that is casual in which the utterance is usually more relaxed.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

== Child-directed speech ==
{{main|Child-directed speech}}
[[File:Mother Kissing Baby.jpg|thumb|A mother kissing her baby daughter]]
The development of utterances in children is facilitated by parents, adults, or any other guardian the child has growing up. Studies have indicated that this development of utterances is affected by the parent, adult, or guardian's [[socioeconomic status]] (SES). It has been shown that children have larger vocabularies and learn new words more quickly during early childhood from parents with a high education and higher SES status, while children with less educated parents and lower SES status have a smaller vocabulary and a slower growth in their [[vocabulary]] skills (Arriaga, Fenson, Cronan &amp; Pethick, 1998; Hart &amp; Risley, 1995; Hoff, Laursen &amp; Tardif, 2002; Hoff-Ginsberg, 1991; Lawrence &amp; Shipley, 1996; Ninio, 1980){{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}. This correlation is due to the fact that more educated parents use more lexis when speaking to their children as opposed to parents that are less educated (Hart &amp; Risley, 1995; Hoff, 2003 a; Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, Waterfall, Vevea &amp; Hedges, in press){{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}. Hoff conducted an analysis that shows support for this correlation in 2003 which shows that the mean length of utterance and vocabulary of mothers who talk to their children is related to their SES status and thus child vocabulary development. High-SES mothers use longer utterances when talking to their children and a wider variety of words. They also spend more time talking to their children. Low-SES mothers use shorter utterances and a smaller vocabulary. As a result, children with more educated parents have larger vocabularies (Hoff, 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=Meredith|title=Child-directed speech: relation to socioeconomic status, knowledge of child development and child vocabulary skill|url=https://www.education.umd.edu/HDQM/labs/Rowe/LDPL/Publications_files/Rowe_JCL_2008.pdf|journal=Cambridge University Press|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In child-directed speech, utterances have several additional features. For example, the [[phonology]] in child-directed speech is different: Utterances are spoken more slowly, with longer pauses in between utterances, higher pitches, etc. The lexis and semantics differ, and a speaker uses words suited for children, "doggie" instead of "dog," for example. The grammar is simpler, repetitive, with less use of verbs and adjectives. There is a greater use of one word utterances and the [[pragmatics]] uses supportive language like expansions and re-casting.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://revisionworld.com/a2-level-level-revision/english-language/child-language-acquisition/child-directed-speech|title=Child Directed Speech {{!}} a2-level-level-revision, english-language, child-language-acquisition, child-directed-speech {{!}} Revision World|website=revisionworld.com|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gricean maxims ==
Paul Grice (1989) came up with four maxims necessary in order to have a collegial conversation in which utterances are understood:

#'''Maxim of Quantity''': provide the right amount of information needed for that conversation
#'''Maxim of Quality''': provide information that is true
#'''Maxim of Relation''': provide information that is relevant to the topic at hand
#'''Maxim of Manner''': give order to your utterances throughout conversation, be clear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mako |first=Okanda |year=2015 |title=Understanding violations of Gricean maxims in preschoolers and adults |pmc=4488609 |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=6 |page= 901|via=Frontiers Media SA |pmid=26191018 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benjamin |first=Spector |year=2013 |title=Maxims of Conversation |url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199772810/obo-9780199772810-0129.xml#obo-9780199772810-0129-div1-0005 |journal=Oxford Bibliographies |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bakhtin's theory of utterance==
According to philosopher  [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], there are four accepted properties that utterances should have:
* '''Boundaries''' – All utterances must be bounded by a "change of speech subject". This usually means, as previously mentioned, that they are bounded      by silence.
* '''Responsivity or dialogicity''' – The utterance must be either responding/following a previous utterance or generating dialogue.
* '''Finalization''' – An utterance must have a clear ending, and only occurs if the speaker has said everything he or she wishes to say.
* '''Generic form''' – The choice of the speech genre is determined based on the specific circumstances and sphere in which the dialogue occurs.

Bakhtin also emphasizes that an utterance and a sentence are not the same thing. According to Bakhtin, sentences do not indicate a change of speech subject, and thus do not automatically satisfy one of the four properties of utterances. According to him, the sentence as a language unit is grammatical in nature, while an utterance is "ethical".&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubpages.unh.edu/~jds/Bakhtin%20utterance.htm Utterance]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vsevolod Vladimirovich Krestovsky''' ({{lang-ru|Все́волод Влади́мирович Кресто́вский}}; February 23, 1840 &amp;ndash; January 30, 1895) was a Russian writer who worked in the [[city mysteries]] genre.

==Biography==
Krestovsky came from an old family of Polish gentry (''szlachta'') with roots in nowadays Ukraine. In 1857 he enrolled in the Historico-Philological faculty of [[Saint Petersburg State University|St Petersburg University]]. At the University he became friends with the radical critic [[Dmitry Pisarev]], and wrote for the magazine ''Russian Word''.&lt;ref name="Handbook 1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Russian Literature |last=Terras |first=Victor |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0300048688 |pages=234–235 |accessdate=June 28, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjKh2gkCudAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=terras&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VPDtT5aDDeew0QG0zpiSDg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=krestovsky&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia 1970-79"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Krestovskii%2c+Vsevolod+Vladimirovich |title=The Great Soviet Encyclopedia |publisher=The Gale Group |accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his short association with the radical camp, he joined a group of moderate [[slavophile]]s which included [[Apollon Maykov]], [[Lev Mei]] and others, and began publishing his works in ''[[Otechestvennye Zapiski|Notes of the Fatherland]]'', ''[[Vremya (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Epoch (Russian magazine)|Epoch]]''. In 1860 he left the University to become a professional writer. His novel ''The Slums of Saint Petersburg'' (1864), a product of many hours of personal observation, gained him considerable popularity.&lt;ref name="Handbook 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia 1970-79"/&gt; 
 
In 1863 he traveled to [[Warsaw]] to take notes for his novel ''The Flock of Panurge'' (1869), about the [[January Uprising]]. In 1874 he wrote another novel, ''The Force'', on the same subject. Both novels were [[reactionary]] in nature. In the 1880s Krestovsky became frankly and openly [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] in his political and social views. His blatantly anti-Semitic trilogy ''The Jews are Coming'' was published between 1888 and 1892. He died in Warsaw in 1895.&lt;ref name="Handbook 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia 1970-79"/&gt;

'''Werner Heinrich Janssen''' (born 7 August 1944 in [[Mönchengladbach]]) is a Dutch/German [[philosopher]], Germanist, author and poet under the pseudonym '''Heinz Hof'''.

== Career ==
Werner Janssen grew up both in Germany (Monchengladbach) and in the [[Netherlands]] (Kerkrade/Heerlen). He studied at the Universities of [[Nijmegen]], [[Heidelberg]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[Aachen]] German language and literature, philosophy, sociology, pedagogy, ethnology, political science, psychology and dialect knowledge.

Very first he graduated in 1984 to Dr. lit. at the University of Amsterdam with the thesis Der Rhythmus bei [[Heinrich Böll]], 1985 published by Peter-Lang-Verlag. At the University of Aachen,  the Rhenish-Westphalian Technical University he graduated in 1991 to Dr. phil. with the thesis Kultur und Spiel – die dialogische Erweiterung des natürlichen Spielraums, also published by Peter Lang.

He is chairman of the Curatorium of the [[Martin Buber]]-Award, which is annually granted since 2002 at the International Culture and Science Festival [[Euriade]], which was set up by him in 1981 and which director he is, just as he is the director of the International Chamber Music Festival [[AmadèO]] – Academia Musica da Camera.

He taught German Language and Philosophy at [[Bernardinuscollege]] in [[Heerlen]], and is now professor of Philosophy and Germanistics among others at the Lomonosow University of Moscow.

He gave/gives guest lectures at the Universities of Perm (Ural), Vienna, Graz and Heerlen.

With the pseudonym ''Heinz Hof'' he writes poetry.

==Central theme==
A central question of the book is 'Why is there something rather than nothing?' lies in the domain between philosophy and scientific cosmology. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] was the first to publish the question in 1714. In this book, the author records a quest to answer the question through a series of interviews and discussions. Some of the people interviewed are [[John Updike]], [[David Deutsch]], [[Adolf Grünbaum]], [[John A. Leslie|John Leslie]], [[Derek Parfit]], [[Roger Penrose]], [[Richard Swinburne]], [[Steven Weinberg]], and [[Andrei Linde]]. Along the way, Jim Holt also introduces the reader to  the [[philosophy of mathematics]], [[theology]], [[physics]], [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], and other subjects.&lt;ref name=bakew/&gt;&lt;ref name=ulins/&gt;&lt;ref name=roth&gt;

==Review==
{{quote|In “Why Does the World Exist?,” Jim Holt, an elegant and witty writer comfortably at home in the problem’s weird interzone between philosophy and scientific cosmology, sets out in search of such answers. He takes inspiration from readings of Heidegger and Sartre, and from something Martin Amis once said in a television interview: “We’re at least five Einsteins away from answering that question.”... Holt reminds us that no exploration of being — especially human being — can be separated from the human who undertakes it, complete with character and the play of moods. Updike felt that the universe had “a color, a quiet but tireless goodness that things at rest, like a brick wall or a small stone, seem to affirm.” Surely this was a mood, even a quirk of biochemistry, but it opens a perspective on the universe, too. The question of being itself, as Updike and Holt agree, can seem profound in one mood, vacuous in another.}}

'''William Lowe Bryan''' (November 11, 1860 – November 21, 1955) was the 10th president of [[Indiana University]], serving from 1902 to 1937.&lt;ref name="psych1988" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
William Lowe Bryan was born William Julian Bryan on November 11, 1860 in [[Monroe County, Indiana]]. His father, John Bryan was a Presbyterian minister and his mother was Eliza Phillips Bryan. Having been born near [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], Bryan graduated from IU with degrees in ancient [[classics]] and [[philosophy]]. His interests shifted toward [[psychology]] and Bryan went on to earn his Ph.D. in psychology from [[Clark University]] in 1892 under the direction of [[G. Stanley Hall]].&lt;ref name="thesis-bryan-1892"&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/301690426/ |title=On the development of voluntary motor ability, with a preface on the requirements of work in experimental psychology |date=1892 |publisher=[[Clark University]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Bryan |first=William L. |via=[[ProQuest]] |subscription=yes |oclc=11645931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psych1988"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psych.indiana.edu/tradition/Hearst_and_Capshew_1988.pdf |title=Psychology at Indiana University: A centennial review And compendium |editor-first1=Eliot |editor-last1=Hearst |editor-first2=James H. |editor-last2=Capshew |year=1988 |publisher=Indiana University Department of Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
That same year Bryan helped organize the [[American Psychological Association]] and became one of its charter members. He returned to IU in 1893 to accept a professorship in the psychology department and the appointment to vice president of the university. He succeeded [[Joseph Swain (academic)|Joseph Swain]] as president in 1902 and led the institution for 35 years until 1937, at which time he retired as president emeritus at the age of 76.

Bryan presided over the transformation of IU from a small, traditional liberal arts college into a modern research university. His most notable accomplishment was the expansion of graduate and professional training. During his administration, schools or departments of medicine, education, journalism, nursing, business, music, and dentistry were established.&lt;ref name="psych1988" /&gt;

One of the early challenges of Bryan's presidency was providing the university campus with a sufficient amount of water for its operation. (Bloomington, and the IU campus in particular, is located on a high ground without any major rivers or lakes in the vicinity, and with little usable [[groundwater]]).&lt;ref name=maxwell&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donald H. |last=Maxwell |title=Impounded water in Bloomington, Ind. |pages=159–161 |journal=Municipal and county engineering: design, construction, maintenance, and operation of all public works |volume=60 |issue=1 |date=January 1921|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZRNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA160 |via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's waterworks existing in the early 20th century being utterly inadequate, Bryan commissioned a team of IU researchers, led by the geologist E.R. Cumings, to investigate the campus' water situation. On March 8, 1910, the Cumings commission recommended a site for the new reservoir, a couple miles northeast of the campus; the reservoir, which became known as the [[Griffy Lake#University Lake|University Lake]], was constructed in 1910-1914.&lt;ref name=cravens&gt;{{cite news |first=John W. |last=Cravens |title=Buildings on the old and new campuses of Indiana University |magazine=Indiana University Alumni Quarterly |volume=9 |year=1922
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAITAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA318 |pages=317–319 |via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no longer used for water supply, the reservoir remains, and is the centerpiece of Indiana University's Research and Teaching Preserve (Griffy Woods).&lt;ref name=sahu&gt;{{cite web |title=Indiana University Griffy Lake Watershed: Sustainability Survey |first=Neil |last=Sahu |year=2008 |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~sustain/docs/sinterns_08/sahu_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A specialist in the philosophical alloying of science and religion, for over thirty years he held university positions in North America, Europe, and Russia.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], [[United States]] on 20 September 1935, and died on 27 November 2005.

==Philosophy==
Although he made significant contributions to the fields of mathematics and philosophy, he is perhaps best known for developing a new proof of [[Existence of God|God's existence]] based on first-order logic and for his work towards a transcultural system of ethics.

In his books ''Love, Power, and Justice'', and ''[[Minimalism: A Bridge between Classical Philosophy and the Baha'i Revelation|Minimalism]]'', Hatcher attempts to prove God's existence while addressing many of the criticisms raised against previous theistic philosophers. While Hatcher admits that his argument does not establish the existence of any particular religion's God, he asserts that it does support the existence of a God that he defines as a unique, universal, and uncaused cause.

Written in first order [[logic]], Hatcher's proof of God is based on three axioms that he calls "[[empirical|empirically grounded]]" and an [[a priori and a posteriori|apriori]] assumption that "something exists."  

The axioms are that:

P1. The principle of sufficient reason: All phenomena are either self-caused (i.e. A-&gt;A) or other-caused (B-&gt;A; B is not equal to A) but not both. Put another way, this principle says that the question "why?" is always meaningful. Everything happens for a reason.

P2. The potency principle: If A -&gt; B then for all C element of B, A -&gt; C. In other words if A is the cause of B then A is 
the cause of every part of B. There are several notions of causality in philosophy. Hatcher's notion of causality is total causality; i.e. it is not the straw that breaks the camel's back but the 1000 straws before it, the camel, gravity, and so forth, that give rise to the camel breaking its back.

P3. The principle of limitation: For all A, where A is an element of B, B -&gt; A does not hold. This says a system (which Hatcher represents as a set) cannot be the cause of its own components. Hatcher justifies this by explaining any system has (1) form (the parts) and (2) function (the relationship between the parts). A car (the system) cannot be the cause of its own steering wheel (a part), because the car does not even logically exist until the steering wheel exists. Thus the car's existence cannot precede the steering wheel's existence.

Hatcher shows that the logical outcome of these 3 axioms together with the above noted assumption are the existence of a "unique, universal, uncaused cause."&lt;ref&gt;[http://william.hatcher.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/logical_proof_presentation_200309.pdf The proof can be downloaded here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this work, Hatcher strives to make his assumptions (his axioms) and modus operandi (first order logic) explicit. Unlike many proofs of God (beginning with the proof advanced by Aristotle) Hatcher's proof does not appeal to the absurdity of an [[infinite regression of causes]]. Hatcher argues that because his proof is formulated in first order logic one must invalidate one or more of his three [[empirically]] grounded [[axioms]] to refute it. At the same time he shows that doing so is difficult as it commits oneself to beliefs not commonly accepted in the scientific community such as the existence of non-causal systems (something not observed to date). 

In ''Love, Power and Justice,'' Hatcher outlines a system of [[ethics]] based on  the principle that there is a universal [[human nature]]. As evidence, he outlines how all new born children will respond positively to love, and negatively to cruelty and hate. 

Hatcher also speaks of intrinsic and extrinsic value. Extrinsic value is not a property of the object itself but is a socially conferred value; for example, the value given by society to money. Intrinsic value on the other hand stands inseparable from the object itself. Whereas extrinsic value can be determined by observation, intrinsic value is discovered upon reflection. Hatcher believes that human beings have intrinsic value, similar to the Kantian notion of our humanity. He says that unless we discover our own intrinsic value, we will seek it elsewhere through means such as competition.

==Work and achievements==
Hatcher is one of eight [[Platonist philosophers]] listed for the second half of the twentieth century in the ''[[Encyclopedie Philosophique Universelle]]''.

Hatcher was the author of over fifty monographs, books, and articles in the mathematical sciences, logic and philosophy. Among the publications of which he is author or coauthor are:

==Relationship to the Bahá'í Faith==
Dr. Hatcher discovered the Bahá'í Faith while a student. He enrolled in the Bahá'í Faith in 1957 following which he wrote [http://www.bci.org/prophecy-fulfilled/challeng.htm a letter to the Yale faculty] explaining to the [[Yale Divinity School]], his reasons for declining to enroll at the school where he was recently admitted. He spent the decades that followed in dedicated service to the Baha'i community and its administrative development, at the local and national level, in the United States, Switzerland, Russia, and Canada.

He served on [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the Baha'is of Canada (1983–91) as well as on the inaugural National Spiritual Assemblies of Switzerland (1962–65) and the Russian Federation (1996). He lived in Russia from 1993 to 1998.  He was also a founding member of the [http://www.bahai-studies.ca Association for Bahá'í Studies].

In a message of condolence, the [[Universal House of Justice]] (the international governing body of the Bahá'í Faith) said that "The Baha'i world has lost one of its brightest minds, one of its most prolific pens ..."
