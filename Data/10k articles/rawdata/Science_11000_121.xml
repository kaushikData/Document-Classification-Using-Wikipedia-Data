'''1ES 1101-232''' is an active galactic nucleus of a distant galaxy known as a [[blazar]].

An X-ray source (catalogued as A 1059-22) was first recorded by Maccagni and colleagues in a 1978 paper; they thought the source arose from a galaxy in the [[Abell 1146]] galaxy cluster, which contained many giant elliptical galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maccagni |first1=D.|last2= Tarenghi | first2= M.|last3=Cooke| first3= B.

They also discovered that the object (and galaxy) were more distant, with a redshift of 0.186.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Two X-ray-selected BL Lacertae objects observed with the HEAO 1 scanning modulation collimator |last1=Remillard| first1= R.

[[File:A591 road, Lake District - June 2009 Edit 1.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The A591 as it passes between Ambleside and Grasmere]]
The '''A591''' is a major road in [[Cumbria]], in the north-west of [[England]], which lies almost entirely within the [[Lake District]] national park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/54.2762057,-2.7628439/54.7355768,-3.2735792/@54.5251929,-3.2201612,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!4m1!3e0 |work=[[Google Maps]] |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 poll by satellite navigation firm [[Garmin]] named the stretch of the road between [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]] and [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] as the most popular road in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/blog/end-of-the-road-for-the-great-british-drive/ |work=Garmin |title=End of the Road for the Great British Drive – UK roads drive motorists to despair |date=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's Favourite Road|url=http://www.britainsfavouriteview.co.uk/Road.asp |accessdate=22 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619074030/http://www.britainsfavouriteview.co.uk/Road.asp |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 29.8 mile stretch between Kendal and Keswick was also named the UK's best driving road, according to a specially devised driving ratio formulated by car rental firm [[Avis Europe|Avis]].&lt;ref&gt;https://leasing.com/car-leasing-news/uks-best-driving-roads-revealed/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route==
The road begins (at its southern end) {{convert|3.5|mi}} north-west of junction 36 of the [[M6 motorway]] at [[Brettargh Holt]] [[roundabout]] with the [[A590 road]] {{nowrap|({{coord|54.2746|-2.7605|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A591 road (southern end)}}),}} close to [[Sizergh Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=9780319263334 |title=Map of The Lake District: South-eastern area (Sheet OL7) |publisher=[[Ordnance Survey]] |year=2017 |url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/explorer-map-the-lake-district-south-eastern-area.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It bypasses the town of [[Kendal]] as a [[dual carriageway]], this £1.9m {{convert|3|mi|adj=on}} section opened on 29 August 1971. It becomes a busy [[single carriageway]] road as it enters the [[Lake District]]. It bypasses the town of [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]],  closely following the north-eastern bank of [[Windermere|Lake Windermere]]. It then travels through the centre of [[Ambleside]], follows the northern side of [[Rydal Water]], passes White Moss Common, follows the eastern edge of [[Grasmere (lake)|Grasmere]] and passes the [[Grasmere (village)|village of Grasmere]]. The road continues over [[Dunmail Raise]] and along the eastern edge of [[Thirlmere]]. Shortly afterwards it reaches the town of [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]]. It meets the [[A66 road]] at a grade-separated junction. Traffic then bypasses Keswick by following the A66 west for 2.2&amp;nbsp;km to a roundabout where the A591 resumes, continuing in a roughly north-westerly direction, with fine views over [[Bassenthwaite Lake]]. The road terminates at the village of [[Bothel, Cumbria|Bothel]], on the [[A595 road]] {{nowrap|({{coord|54.7357|-3.2733|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A591 road (northern end)}}).}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=9780319242438 |title=Map of The Lake District: North-western area (Sheet OL4) |publisher=[[Ordnance Survey]] |year=2017 |url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/explorer-map-the-lake-district-south-eastern-area.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bothel-to-Keswick section has many acute bends and is particularly narrow in places, leading to many accidents{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. 

===Storm damage and closure===
The road was badly damaged during [[Storm Desmond]] on 5 December 2015 including a part washed away at Dunmail Raise and landslip adjacent to Thirlmere.  The closed section of road between Grasmere and [[Legburthwaite]] reopened on 11 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new |title=Storm Desmond: A591 reopens ahead of schedule |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-36262619/ |work=BBC News |date=11 May 2016 |accessdate= 18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the road was closed a new trail for walkers, cyclists, and horseriders was built to the west of the road at Dunmail Raise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New trail to link flood-hit lakeland at Dunmail Rise |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-36151496 |author=BBC News |date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cog's ladder''' of group development is based on the work, "Cog's Ladder: A Model of Group Growth", by [[George O. Charrier]], an employee of [[Procter and Gamble]], published in a company newsletter in 1972.  The original document was written to help group managers at Procter and Gamble better understand the dynamics of group work, thus improving efficiency.  It is now also used by the [[United States Naval Academy]], the [[United States Air Force Academy]], and other businesses – to help in understanding group development.&lt;ref&gt;Malthus, T. R., &amp; Mandal, B. N. (2008). The Principle of population: An essay on principle of population, as it affects the future improvement of society with remarks on the speculations of Mr. Godwin, M. Condorcet, and other writers. New Delhi, India: Global Vision Pub. House. p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==
The basic idea of Cog's ladder is that there are five steps necessary for a small group of people to be able to work efficiently together.  These stages are the ''polite stage'', the ''why we're here stage'', the ''power stage'', the ''cooperation stage'' and the ''esprit stage''.  Groups can only move forward after completing the current stage as in [[Jean Piaget]]'s stage model.

===Polite stage===
An introductory phase where members strive to get acquainted or reacquainted with one another. During this phase, the basis for the group structure is established and is characterized by polite social interaction. All ideas are simple, controversy is avoided and all members limit self-disclosure.  Judgements of other members are formed, and this sets the tone for the rest of the group's time.

===Why we're here stage===
Group members will want to know why they have been called together. The specific agenda for each planning session will be communicated by the moderator or leader. In this phase, individual need for approval begins to diminish as the members examine their group's purpose and begin to set goals.  Often, social cliques will begin to form as members begin to feel as though they "fit in."

===Power stage===
Bids for power begin between group members in an effort to convince each other that their position on an issue is correct.  Often, the field of candidates vying for leadership narrows, as fewer members strive to establish power.  Some of those who contributed freely to the group discussion in earlier stages now remain silent, wishing not to engage in a power struggle.  It is noted that interactions arising out of this phase do not usually result in optimum solutions.  Hence, there is a great need for structure and patience in this stage.*

===Cooperation stage===
Members not only begin to accept that others have an opinion worth expressing, but a team spirit replaces vested interests.  Often, new levels of creativity are achieved, and the group's productivity soars.  If new individuals are introduced into the membership at this point, they will be viewed as outsiders or intruders, and the group will have to evolve again, much as it did initially.

===Esprit stage===
Esprit de corps:  a golden rule by [[Henri Fayol]] is closely associated with this stage of Cog's, which says that nothing has higher pinnacles to reach than spirit of corps.

Mutual acceptance with high cohesiveness and a general feeling of esprit.  Charrier states that the planning team can do its finest work and be most productive in this final stage in the model.  It is also noted that this stage will not always be achieved; however, for this level of cooperation, as well as productivity, the other four stages must be met.

==Comparisons==
Cog's ladder is very similar to [[Forming-storming-norming-performing|Tuckman's stages]], another stage model of groups, which lacks the "Why We're Here" stage, and calls the remaining four stages "Forming", "Storming", "Norming", and "Performing". There are also other similar models, some of which are cyclic rather than reaching an end state.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1798">A '''commodity chain''' is a process used by [[business entity|firm]]s to gather [[resource]]s, transform them into goods or [[commodity|commodities]], and finally, distribute them to consumers. It is a series of links connecting the many places of production and distribution and resulting in a commodity that is then exchanged on the world market. In short, it is the connected path from which a good travels from producers to consumers. Commodity chains can be unique depending on the product types or the types of markets. Different stages of a commodity chain can also involve different economic sectors or be handled by the same business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch5en/conc5en/ch5c3en.html Geography of transportation]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of commentators have remarked that in the Internet age commodity chains are becoming increasingly more transparent.  The Wikichains.com project has adopted the same wiki technology used by Wikipedia in order to help make commodity chains more transparent. "They are a network of labour and production processes whose end result is a finished commodity". William Jones Esq.

A commodity chain demonstrates that each link of an extended chain of production and consumption links between resource producers and suppliers, various manufacturers, traders and shippers, wholesalers, and retailers. Rather than a linear chain, a circuit-board is a better metaphor for this concept because things are interconnected in so many ways, not just a mere straight line. This source explains global commodity chains in depth. [http://internationalstudies.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-201]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">'''Currency packaging''' includes several forms of packing money for easy handling and counting.  Many systems use standard [[Color code|color-coding]] or are marked to indicate the amount in the package.

==Currency straps==
[[File:StrappedCurrency.jpg|thumb|120 px|Currency strap holding U.S. bills]]
{{Main|Currency strap}}
[[Currency strap|Currency straps]], also known as currency bands or bill straps, are a type of fastener used to secure discrete numbers of bills.  Typically, currency bands have attached ends so bills are "curled" and slipped into the band whereas currency straps contain adhesive on the ends to secure them around the bills after wrapping.

==Currency vacuum packaging==
Generated bundles are packed together in groups of 10 (1000 banknotes) and vacuumized. A cliche print containing bank and branch details is applied to the plastic package seal.
Vacuum packing is the most reliable and effective way of storing currency units, enabling the currency to be protected against tarnishing, such as from moisture and dirt. Vacuum packed banknotes also take up less space in containers used during cash transportation. Currency units are vacuum packed by means of a [[vacuum sealer]].

==Currency Bags==
{{Main|Security bag}}
[[File:Tamper_evident_currency_bag.jpg|thumb|120 px|Tamper evident bag]]
Bags used to hold a specific amount of paper currency. Usually tamper evident, and has labels to make notes on the front.

==Coin bags==
Bags used to hold a specific number of coins.

==Coin wrappers==
[[File:2010-06-28 James Madison 25USD coin roll.jpg|thumb|120 px|Coin wrapper full of dollars]]
{{Main|Coin wrapper}}
Tubes used to hold a specific number of coins.

==Currency trays==
Trays used to handle currency, often sorting by denomination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2366">A '''cyclic flower''' is a flower type formed out of a series of [[Whorl (botany)|whorls]];&lt;ref name="Swartz"&gt;{{cite book|page=136|title=Collegiate Dictionary of Botany|last=Swartz|first=Delbert|publisher=The Ronald Press Company|location=New York|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets of identical organs attached around the axis at the same point. Most flowers consist of a single whorl of [[sepal]]s termed a [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]]; a single whorl of [[petal]]s termed a [[corolla (flower)|corolla]]; one or more whorls of [[stamen]]s (together termed the [[androecium]]); and a single whorl of [[carpel]]s termed the [[gynoecium]]. This is a cyclic arrangement.

Some flowers contain flower parts with a spiral arrangement. Such flowers are not cyclic. However in the common case of spirally arranged sepals on an otherwise cyclic flower, the term '''hemicyclic''' may be used.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|page=174|title=A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent|last=Jackson|first=Benjamin Daydon|edition=fourth|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London|year=1928|url=https://archive.org/details/glossaryofbotani1928jack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suffix '''-cyclic''' is used to denote the number of whorls contained within a flower. The most common case is the '''pentacyclic''' flower, which contains five whorls:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=271|title=A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent|last=Jackson|first=Benjamin Daydon|edition=fourth|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London|year=1928|url=https://archive.org/details/glossaryofbotani1928jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; a calyx, a corolla, two whorls of stamens, and a single whorl of carpels. Another common case is the '''tetracyclic''' flower, which contains only one whorl of stamens, and therefore only four whorls in total. '''Tricyclic''' flowers also occur, generally where there is a single undifferentiated [[Petal|perianth]]. Flowers with more than five whorls are also not uncommon. The greatest variation occurs in the calyx and the androecium. Calyces of up to nine whorls have been recorded, and up to 12 whorls of stamens have been observed.

== Mathematical Model and Inference==

===Mathematical Model===
The basis of DCA is a statistical model for the variability within a set of [[Phylogeny|phylogenetically related]] [[Sequence (biology)|biological sequences]]. When fitted to a [[Multiple Sequence Alignment|multiple sequence alignment]] (MSA) of sequences of length &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;, the model defines a probability for all possible sequences of the same length.&lt;ref name="morcos_2011" /&gt; This probability can be interpreted as the probability that the sequence in question belongs to the same class of sequences as the ones in the MSA, for example the class of all protein sequences belonging to a specific [[protein family]].

We denote a sequence by &lt;math&gt; a = (a_1,a_2..,a_N) &lt;/math&gt;, with the &lt;math&gt; a_i &lt;/math&gt; being [[categorical variable]]s representing the [[monomer]]s of the sequence (if the sequences are for example [[Sequence alignment|aligned]] [[amino acid]] sequences of proteins of a protein family, the &lt;math&gt; a_i &lt;/math&gt; take as values any of the 20 [[Amino acid#Table of standard amino acid abbreviations and properties|standard amino acids]]). The probability of a sequence within a model is then defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P\left(a | J,h\right) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp{\left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N-1} \sum\limits_{j=i+1}^{N} J_{ij}(a_i,a_j) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} h_i(a_i)\right)},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where 
 
:* &lt;math&gt; J,h &lt;/math&gt; are sets of real numbers representing the parameters of the model (more below)
:* &lt;math&gt; Z &lt;/math&gt; is a normalization constant (a real number) to ensure &lt;math&gt; \sum\limits_{a} P(a | J,h) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The parameters &lt;math&gt; h_i(a_i) &lt;/math&gt; depend on one position &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; and the symbol &lt;math&gt; a_i &lt;/math&gt; at this position. They are usually called fields&lt;ref name="morcos_2011" /&gt; and represent the propensity of symbol to be found at a certain position. The parameters &lt;math&gt; J_{ij}(a_i,a_j) &lt;/math&gt; depend on pairs of positions &lt;math&gt; i,j &lt;/math&gt; and the symbols &lt;math&gt; a_i,a_j, &lt;/math&gt; at these positions. They are usually called couplings&lt;ref name="morcos_2011" /&gt; and represent an interaction, i.e. a term quantifying how compatible the symbols at both positions are with each other. The model is [[Network topology#Fully connected network|fully connected]], so there are interactions between all pairs of positions. The model can be seen as a generalization of the [[Ising model]], with spins not only taking two values, but any value from a given finite alphabet. In fact, when the size of the alphabet is 2, the model reduces to the Ising model. Since it is also reminiscent of [[Potts Model|the model of the same name]], it is often called Potts Model.&lt;ref name="feinauer_2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feinauer|first1=Christoph|last2=Skwark|first2=Marcin J.|last3=Pagnani|first3=Andrea|last4=Aurell|first4=Erik|title=Improving Contact Prediction along Three Dimensions|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|date=9 October 2014|volume=10|issue=10|pages=e1003847|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003847|pmid=25299132|pmc=4191875|arxiv=1403.0379|bibcode=2014PLSCB..10E3847F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that even knowing the probabilities of all sequences does not determine the parameters &lt;math&gt; J,h &lt;/math&gt; uniquely. For example, a simple transformation of the parameters

:&lt;math&gt; 
J_{ij}(a,b) \rightarrow J_{ij}(a,b) + R_{ij} 
&lt;/math&gt;

for any set of real numbers &lt;math&gt; R_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; leaves the probabilities the same. The [[likelihood function]] is invariant under such transformations as well, so the data cannot be used to fix these degrees of freedom (although a [[Prior distribution|prior]] on the parameters might do so&lt;ref name="aurell_2013"/&gt;).

A convention often found in literature&lt;ref name="aurell_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baldassi_2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldassi|first1=Carlo|last2=Zamparo|first2=Marco|last3=Feinauer|first3=Christoph|last4=Procaccini|first4=Andrea|last5=Zecchina|first5=Riccardo|last6=Weigt|first6=Martin|last7=Pagnani|first7=Andrea|last8=Hamacher|first8=Kay|title=Fast and Accurate Multivariate Gaussian Modeling of Protein Families: Predicting Residue Contacts and Protein-Interaction Partners|journal=PLoS ONE|date=24 March 2014|volume=9|issue=3|pages=e92721|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092721|pmid=24663061|pmc=3963956|arxiv=1404.1240|bibcode=2014PLoSO...992721B}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to fix these degrees of freedom such that the [[Matrix norm#Frobenius norm|Frobenius norm]] of the coupling matrix 
:&lt;math&gt;
F_{ij} = \sqrt{\sum\limits_{a,b} J_{ij}(a,b)^2}, 
&lt;/math&gt;

is minimized (independently for every pair of positions &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt;).

To justify the Potts model, it is often noted that it can be derived following a [[Principle of maximum entropy|maximum entropy principle]]:&lt;ref name="stein_2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stein|first1=Richard R.|last2=Marks|first2=Debora S.|last3=Sander|first3=Chris|last4=Chen|first4=Shi-Jie|title=Inferring Pairwise Interactions from Biological Data Using Maximum-Entropy Probability Models|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|date=30 July 2015|volume=11|issue=7|pages=e1004182|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004182|pmid=26225866|pmc=4520494|bibcode=2015PLSCB..11E4182S}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a given set of sample [[covariance]]s and frequencies, the Potts model represents the distribution with the maximal [[Shannon entropy]] of all distributions reproducing those covariances and frequencies. For a [[Sequence alignment|multiple sequence alignment]], the sample covariances are defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
C_{ij}(a,b) = f_{ij}(a,b) - f_i(a)f_j(b) 
&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; f_{ij}(a,b) &lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of finding symbols &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; at positions &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt; in the same sequence in the MSA, and &lt;math&gt; f_i(a) &lt;/math&gt; the frequency of finding symbol &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; at position &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;. The Potts model is then the unique distribution &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; that maximizes the functional

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F[P] = &amp;- \sum\limits_{a} P(a) \log P(a) \\
&amp;+ \sum\limits_{i&lt;j} \sum\limits_{x,y} \lambda_{ij}(x,y) \Big( P_{ij}(x,y) - f_{ij}(x,y) \Big) \\
&amp;+ \sum\limits_{i}\sum\limits_{x} \lambda_{i}(x) \Big( P_i(x) - f_i(x) \Big) \\
&amp;+ \Omega \left(1 - \sum\limits_{a} P(a)\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first term in the functional is the [[Shannon entropy]] of the distribution. The &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; are [[Lagrange multiplier]]s to ensure &lt;math&gt; P_{ij}(x,y) = f_{ij}(x,y) &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;P_{ij}(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; being the marginal probability to find symbols &lt;math&gt; x,y &lt;/math&gt; at positions &lt;math&gt; i,j &lt;/math&gt;. The Lagrange multiplier &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; ensures normalization. 
Maximizing this functional and identifying

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\lambda_{ij}(x,y) = J_{ij}(x,y) \\
&amp;\lambda_{i}(x) = h_i(x) \\
&amp;\Omega = Z \\
\end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

leads to the Potts model above. It should be noted that this procedure only gives the functional form of the Potts model, while the numerical values of the Lagrange multipliers (identified with the parameters) still have to be determined by fitting the model to the data.

===Direct Couplings and Indirect Correlation===
The central point of DCA is to interpret the &lt;math&gt; J_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; (which can be represented as a &lt;math&gt; q\times q&lt;/math&gt; matrix if there are &lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt; possible symbols) as direct couplings. If two positions are under joint [[evolutionary pressure]] (for example to maintain a structural bond), one might expect these couplings to be large because only sequences with fitting pairs of symbols should have a significant probability. On the other hand, a large correlation between two positions does not necessarily mean that the couplings are large, since large couplings between e.g. positions &lt;math&gt; i,j &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; j,k &lt;/math&gt; might lead to large correlations between positions &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;, mediated by position &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="morcos_2011" /&gt; In fact, such indirect correlations have been implicated in the high false positive rate when inferring protein residue contacts using correlation measures like [[Mutual Information|mutual information]].&lt;ref name="burger_2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burger|first1=Lukas|last2=van Nimwegen|first2=Erik|last3=Bourne|first3=Philip E.|title=Disentangling Direct from Indirect Co-Evolution of Residues in Protein Alignments|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|date=1 January 2010|volume=6|issue=1|pages=e1000633|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000633|pmid=20052271|pmc=2793430|bibcode=2010PLSCB...6E0633B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inference===
The inference of the Potts model on a [[multiple sequence alignment]] (MSA) using [[maximum likelihood estimation]] is usually computationally intractable, because one needs to calculate the normalization constant &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, which is for sequence length &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt; possible symbols a sum of &lt;math&gt;q^N&lt;/math&gt; terms (which means for example for a small protein domain family with 30 positions &lt;math&gt;20^{30}&lt;/math&gt; terms). Therefore, numerous approximations and alternatives have been developed:

All of these methods lead to some form of estimate for the set of parameters &lt;math&gt;J,{h}&lt;/math&gt; maximizing the likelihood of the MSA. Many of them include [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] or [[Prior probability|prior]] terms to ensure a well-posed problem or promote a sparse solution.

== Applications ==

=== Protein Residue Contact Prediction ===
A possible interpretation of large values of couplings in a model fitted to a MSA of a protein family is the existence of conserved contacts between positions (residues) in the family. Such a contact can lead to [[molecular coevolution]], since a mutation in one of the two residues, without a compensating mutation in the other residue, is likely to disrupt [[protein structure]] and negatively affect the fitness of the protein. Residue pairs for which there is a strong [[selective pressure]] to maintain mutual compatibility are therefore expected to mutate together or not at all. This idea (which was known in literature long before the conception of DCA&lt;ref name="goebel_1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Göbel|first1=Ulrike|last2=Sander|first2=Chris|last3=Schneider|first3=Reinhard|last4=Valencia|first4=Alfonso|title=Correlated mutations and residue contacts in proteins|journal=Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics|date=April 1994|volume=18|issue=4|pages=309–317|doi=10.1002/prot.340180402|pmid=8208723}}&lt;/ref&gt;) has been used to predict [[Protein contact map#Contact map prediction|protein contact maps]], for example analyzing the mutual information between protein residues.

Within the framework of DCA, a score for the strength of the direct interaction between a pair of residues &lt;math&gt; i,j &lt;/math&gt; is often defined&lt;ref name="aurell_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baldassi_2014"/&gt; using the Frobenius norm &lt;math&gt; F_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; of the corresponding coupling matrix &lt;math&gt; J_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; and applying an ''average product correction'' (APC):

:&lt;math&gt;
F^{APC}_{ij} = F_{ij} - \frac{F_{i} F_{j}}{F},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; F_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; has been defined above and

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
&amp;F_{i} = \frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{j \neq i}^{N} F_{ij} \\
&amp;F = \frac{1}{N^2-N}\sum\limits_{i,j, i \neq j}^{N} F_{ij}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.
 
This correction term was first introduced for mutual information&lt;ref name="dunn_2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunn|first1=S.D.|last2=Wahl|first2=L.M.|last3=Gloor|first3=G.B.|title=Mutual information without the influence of phylogeny or entropy dramatically improves residue contact prediction|journal=Bioinformatics|date=5 December 2007|volume=24|issue=3|pages=333–340|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btm604|pmid=18057019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to remove biases of specific positions to produce large &lt;math&gt; F_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;. Scores that are invariant under parameter transformations that do not affect the probabilities have also been used.&lt;ref name="morcos_2011"/&gt;
Sorting all residue pairs by this score results in a list in which the top of the list is strongly enriched in residue contacts when compared to the protein contact map of a homologous protein.&lt;ref name="marks_2011"/&gt; High-quality predictions of residue contacts are valuable as prior information in [[protein structure prediction]].&lt;ref name="marks_2011"/&gt;

=== Inference of protein-protein interaction ===
DCA can be used for detecting conserved [[Protein-protein interaction|interaction]] between protein families and for predicting which residue pairs form contacts in a [[Multiprotein complex|protein complex]].&lt;ref name="ovchinnikov_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="feinauer_2016"/&gt; Such predictions can be used when generating structural models for these complexes,&lt;ref name="schug_2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schug|first1=A.|last2=Weigt|first2=M.|last3=Onuchic|first3=J.

DCA can be used to model fitness landscapes and to predict the effect of a mutation in the amino acid sequence of a protein on its fitness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="figliuzzi_2015"/&gt;

'''Dynamic mechanical analysis''' (abbreviated '''DMA''', also known as '''dynamic mechanical spectroscopy''') is a technique used to study and characterize materials. It is most useful for studying the [[viscoelastic]] behavior of [[polymers]]. A [[sinusoidal]] [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] is applied and the [[strain (mechanics)|strain]] in the material is measured, allowing one to determine the [[Dynamic modulus|complex modulus]]. The [[temperature]] of the sample or the frequency of the stress are often varied, leading to variations in the complex modulus; this approach can be used to locate the [[glass transition temperature]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://coventivecomposites.com/explainers/dynamic-mechanical-analysis-dma/|accessdate=2018-10-01|title=What is Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA)?}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the material, as well as to identify transitions corresponding to other molecular motions.

==Theory==

===Viscoelastic properties of materials===
[[Image:Dynamic+Tests+Setup+Chem+538.jpg|thumb|325px|Figure 1. A typical DMA tester with grips to hold sample and environmental chamber to provide different temperature conditions. A sample is mounted on the grips and the environmental chamber can slide over to enclose the sample.]]
Polymers composed of long molecular chains have unique viscoelastic properties, which combine the characteristics of [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic solid]]s and [[Newtonian fluid]]s. The classical theory of elasticity describes the mechanical properties of elastic solid where stress is proportional to strain in small deformations. Such response of stress is independent of [[strain rate]].  The classical theory of hydrodynamics describes the properties of viscous fluid, for which the response of stress is dependent on strain rate.&lt;ref name="Ferry1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferry|first=J.D.|title=Viscoelastic properties of polymers|publisher=Wiley|year=1980|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solidlike and liquidlike behavior of polymers can be modeled mechanically with combinations of springs and dashpots.&lt;ref name="Ferry1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferry|first=J.D|year=1991|title=Some reflections on the early development of polymer dynamics: Viscoelasticity, dielectric dispersion and self-diffusion|doi=10.1021/ma00019a001|journal=Macromolecules|volume=24|issue=19|pages=5237–5245|bibcode = 1991MaMol..24.5237F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic moduli of polymers===
The viscoelastic property of a polymer is studied by dynamic mechanical analysis where a sinusoidal force (stress σ) is applied to a material and the resulting displacement (strain) is measured. For a perfectly elastic solid, the resulting strain and the stress will be perfectly in phase. For a purely viscous fluid, there will be a 90 degree phase lag of strain with respect to stress.&lt;ref name="Meyers1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyers|first=M.A.|author2=Chawla K.K.|title=Mechanical Behavior of Materials|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viscoelastic polymers have the characteristics in between where some [[phase lag]] will occur during DMA tests.&lt;ref name=Meyers1999/&gt; When the stress is applied and the strain lags behind, the following equations hold:&lt;ref name="Meyers1999"/&gt;

*Stress: &lt;math&gt; \sigma = \sigma_0 \sin(t\omega + \delta) \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=Meyers1999/&gt;
*Strain: &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon = \varepsilon_0 \sin(t\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; is frequency of strain oscillation,
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time,
:&lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is phase lag between stress and strain.

Consider the purely elastic case, where stress is proportional to strain.  We have &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; 
\sigma(t) = E \epsilon(t)
\implies  \sigma_0 \sin{(\omega t + \delta)} = E  \epsilon_0 \sin{\omega t}
\implies \delta = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Now for the purely viscous case, where stress is proportional to strain ''rate''.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
 \sigma(t) = K \frac{d\epsilon}{dt}
\implies  \sigma_0 \sin{(\omega t + \delta)} = K  \epsilon_0 \omega \cos{\omega t}
\implies \delta = \frac{\pi}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The storage modulus measures the stored energy, representing the elastic portion, and the loss modulus measures the energy dissipated as heat, representing the viscous portion.&lt;ref name=Meyers1999/&gt; The tensile storage and loss moduli are defined as follows:

*Storage Modulus:  &lt;math&gt; E' = \frac {\sigma_0} {\varepsilon_0} \cos \delta &lt;/math&gt;
*Loss Modulus: &lt;math&gt; E'' =  \frac {\sigma_0} {\varepsilon_0} \sin \delta &lt;/math&gt;
*Phase Angle: &lt;math&gt; \delta = \arctan\frac {E''}{E'} &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly we also define [[Shear modulus|shear storage]] and loss moduli, &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G''&lt;/math&gt;.

Complex variables can be used to express the moduli &lt;math&gt;E^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^*&lt;/math&gt; as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;E^* = E' + iE'' \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;G^* = G' + iG'' \,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;{i}^2 = -1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

====Derivation of dynamic moduli====

Shear stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma(t)=\int_{-\infty}^t G(t-t') \dot{\gamma}(t')dt'&lt;/math&gt; of a finite element in one direction can be expressed with relaxation modulus &lt;math&gt;G(t-t')&lt;/math&gt; and strain rate, integrated over all past times &lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt; up to the current time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. With strain rate &lt;math&gt; \dot{\gamma(t)}=\omega \cdot  \gamma_0 \cdot \cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;and  substitution &lt;math&gt;\xi(t')=t-t'=s &lt;/math&gt; one obtains  &lt;math&gt;\sigma(t)=\int_{\xi(-\infty)=t-(-\infty)}^{\xi(t)=t-t} G(s) \omega \gamma_0 \cdot \cos(\omega(t-s))(-ds)=\gamma_0\int_0^{\infty} \omega G(s)\cos(\omega(t-s))ds&lt;/math&gt;. Application of the trigonometric addition theorem &lt;math&gt;\cos(x \pm y)=\cos(x)\cos(y) \mp \sin(x)\sin(y)&lt;/math&gt; lead to the expression 
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\sigma(t)}{\gamma(t)}=\underbrace{[\omega\int_o^{\infty}G(s)\sin(\omega s) ds]}_{\text{shear storage modulus }G'} \sin(\omega t)+\underbrace{[\omega\int_o^{\infty}G(s)\cos(\omega s) ds]}_{\text{shear loss modulus }G''} \cos(\omega t).
\,&lt;/math&gt; 
with converging integrals, if &lt;math&gt;G(s) \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;s  \rightarrow \infty &lt;/math&gt;, which depend on frequency but not of time. Extension of &lt;math&gt;\sigma(t)=\sigma_0 \cdot \sin (\omega \cdot t + \Delta \varphi) &lt;/math&gt; with trigonometric identity &lt;math&gt; \sin(x \pm y)=\sin(x)\cdot \cos(y) \pm \cos(x)\cdot \sin(y)&lt;/math&gt; lead to 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\sigma(t)}{\gamma(t)}=\underbrace{\frac{\sigma_0}{\gamma_0} \cdot \cos(\Delta \varphi)}_{G'}\cdot \sin (\omega \cdot t)+ \underbrace{\frac{\sigma_0}{\gamma_0} \cdot \sin(\Delta \varphi)}_{G''} \cdot \cos (\omega \cdot t)
\,&lt;/math&gt;. 
Comparison of the two &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sigma(t)}{\gamma(t)}&lt;/math&gt; equations lead to the definition of &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G''&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Ferry"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferry|first=J.D.|author2 = Myers, Henry S |year=1961|title=Viscoelastic properties of polymers|journal=The Electrochemical Society |volume=108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Applications==

===Measuring glass transition temperature===
[[Image:Temp Sweep Chem538.jpg|thumb|325px|Figure 2. A temperature sweep test on Polycarbonate. Storage Modulus (E’) and Loss Modulus (E’’) against temperature were plotted. Different initial static load and strain were used. The glass transition temperature of Polycarbonate was detected to be around 150 degree C.The Polycarbonate samples were made from the material purchased from Mcmaster-Carr, #8574k26]] One important application of DMA is measurement of the [[Glass transition#Transition temperature Tg|glass transition temperature]] of polymers.  Amorphous polymers have different glass transition temperatures, above which the material will have [[rubber]]y properties instead of glassy behavior and the stiffness of the material will drop dramatically with an increase in viscosity. At the glass transition, the storage modulus decreases dramatically and the loss modulus reaches a maximum. Temperature-sweeping DMA is often used to characterize the glass transition temperature of a material.

===Polymer composition===

Varying the composition of monomers and [[cross-link]]ing can add or change the functionality of a polymer that can alter the results obtained from DMA.  An example of such changes can be seen by blending ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) with [[styrene-butadiene rubber]] (SBR) and different cross-linking or curing systems.  Nair ''et al.'' abbreviate blends as E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;S,  E&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;S, etc., where E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;S equals the weight percent of EPDM in the blend and S denotes sulfur as the curing agent.&lt;ref name="Nair"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nair|first=T.M.|author2=Kumaran, M.G. |author3=Unnikrishnan, G. |author4= Pillai, V.B. |year=2009|title=Dynamic Mechanical Analysis of Ethylene-Propylene-Diene Monomer Rubber and Styrene-Butadiene Rubber Blends|journal=Journal of Applied Polymer Science|volume=112|pages=72–81|doi = 10.1002/app.29367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing the amount of SBR in the blend decreased the storage modulus due to [[intermolecular]] and [[intramolecular]] interactions that can alter the physical state of the polymer.  Within the glassy region, EPDM shows the highest storage modulus due to stronger intermolecular interactions (SBR has more [[steric]] hindrance that makes it less crystalline).  In the rubbery region, SBR shows the highest storage modulus resulting from its ability to resist intermolecular slippage.&lt;ref name="Nair" /&gt;

When compared to sulfur, the higher storage modulus occurred for blends cured with dicumyl peroxide(DCP)because of the relative strengths of C-C and C-S bonds.

Incorporation of reinforcing fillers into the polymer blends also increases the storage modulus at an expense of limiting the loss tangent peak height.

DMA can also be used to effectively evaluate the miscibility of polymers.  The E&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;S blend had a much broader transition with a shoulder instead of a steep drop-off in a storage modulus plot of varying blend ratios, indicating that there are areas that are not homogeneous.&lt;ref name="Nair" /&gt;

==Instrumentation==
[[Image:Schematic of DMA.png|thumb|Figure 3. General schematic of a DMA instrument.]]

The instrumentation of a DMA consists of a displacement sensor such as a [[linear variable differential transformer]], which measures a change in voltage as a result of the instrument probe moving through a magnetic core, a temperature control system or furnace, a drive motor (a linear motor for probe loading which provides load for the applied force), a drive shaft support and guidance system to act as a guide for the  force from the motor to the sample, and sample clamps in order to hold the sample being tested.  Depending on what is being measured, samples will be prepared and handled differently.  A general schematic of the primary components of a DMA instrument is shown in figure 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mse.iastate.edu/research/research-groups/gom/laboratory-facilities/charaterization-lab/dma.html|title=DMA|accessdate=2010-02-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610052549/http://www.mse.iastate.edu/research/research-groups/gom/laboratory-facilities/charaterization-lab/dma.html|archivedate=2010-06-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of analyzers===
There are two main types of DMA analyzers used currently: forced resonance analyzers and free resonance analyzers.  Free resonance analyzers measure the free oscillations of damping of the sample being tested by suspending and swinging the sample.  A restriction to free resonance analyzers is that it is limited to rod or rectangular shaped samples, but samples that can be woven/braided are also applicable.  Forced resonance analyzers are the more common type of analyzers available in instrumentation today.  These types of analyzers force the sample to oscillate at a certain frequency and are reliable for performing a temperature sweep.

[[Image:Analyzers.png|thumb|left|Figure 4. Torsional versus Axial Motions.]]

Analyzers are made for both stress (force) and strain (displacement) control.  In strain control, the probe is displaced and the resulting stress of the sample is measured by implementing a force balance transducer, which utilizes different shafts.  The advantages of strain control include a better short time response for materials of low viscosity and experiments of stress relaxation are done with relative ease.  In stress control, a set force is applied to the same and several other experimental conditions (temperature, frequency, or time) can be varied.  Stress control is typically less expensive than strain control because only one shaft is needed, but this also makes it harder to use.  Some advantages of stress control include the fact that the structure of the sample is less likely to be destroyed and longer relaxation times/ longer creep studies can be done with much more ease.  Characterizing low viscous materials come at a disadvantage of short time responses that are limited by [[inertia]].  Stress and strain control analyzers give about the same results as long as characterization is within the linear region of the polymer in question.  However, stress control lends a more realistic response because polymers have a tendency to resist a load.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Menard|first=Kevin P.|title=Dynamic Mechanical Analysis: A Practical Introduction|publisher=CRC Press|year=1999|chapter= 4 |isbn=0-8493-8688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stress and strain can be applied via torsional or axial analyzers.  Torsional analyzers are mainly used for liquids or melts but can also be implemented for some solid samples since the force is applied in a twisting motion. The instrument can do creep-recovery, stress–relaxation, and stress–strain experiments.  Axial analyzers are used for solid or semisolid materials.  It can do flexure, tensile, and compression testing (even shear and liquid specimens if desired).  These analyzers can test higher modulus materials than torsional analyzers.  The instrument can do [[thermomechanical analysis]] (TMA) studies in addition to the experiments that torsional analyzers can do. Figure 4 shows the general difference between the two applications of stress and strain.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

Changing sample geometry and fixtures can make stress and strain analyzers virtually indifferent of one another except at the extreme ends of sample phases, i.e. really fluid or rigid materials.  Common geometries and fixtures for axial analyzers include three-point and four-point bending, dual and single cantilever, parallel plate and variants, bulk, extension/tensile, and shear plates and sandwiches.  Geometries and fixtures for torsional analyzers consist of parallel plates, cone-and-plate, couette, and torsional beam and braid.  In order to utilize DMA to characterize materials, the fact that small dimensional changes can also lead to large inaccuracies in certain tests needs to be addressed.  Inertia and shear heating can affect the results of either forced or free resonance analyzers, especially in fluid samples.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

===Test modes===
Two major kinds of test modes can be used to probe the viscoelastic properties of polymers: temperature sweep and frequency sweep tests. A third, less commonly studied test mode is dynamic stress–strain testing.

====Temperature sweep====
A common test method involves measuring the complex modulus at low constant frequency while varying the sample temperature. A prominent peak in &lt;math&gt;\tan(\delta)&lt;/math&gt; appears at the glass transition temperature of the polymer. Secondary transitions can also be observed, which can be attributed to the temperature-dependent activation of a wide variety of chain motions.&lt;ref name = "Young"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=R.J.|author2=P.A. Lovell|title=Introduction to Polymers|publisher=Nelson Thornes|year=1991|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[semi-crystalline polymer]]s, separate transitions can be observed for the crystalline and amorphous sections. Similarly, multiple transitions are often found in polymer blends.

For instance, blends of [[polycarbonate]] and poly([[acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene]]) were studied with the intention of developing a polycarbonate-based material without polycarbonate’s tendency towards [[brittle failure]]. Temperature-sweeping DMA of the blends showed two strong transitions coincident with the glass transition temperatures of PC and PABS, consistent with the finding that the two polymers were immiscible.&lt;ref name=Mas&gt;{{cite journal|last=J. Màs |year=2002|title=Dynamic mechanical properties of polycarbonate and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer blends|doi=10.1002/app.10043|journal=Journal of Applied Polymer Science|volume=83|issue=7|pages=1507–1516|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Frequency sweep====
[[Image:Freq Sweep Chem538.jpg|thumb|325px|Figure 5. A frequency sweep test on Polycarbonate under room temperature (25 °C). Storage Modulus (E’) and Loss Modulus (E’’) were plotted against frequency. The increase of frequency “freezes” the chain movements and a stiffer behavior was observed.]]

A sample can be held to a fixed temperature and can be tested at varying frequency. Peaks in &lt;math&gt;\tan(\delta)&lt;/math&gt; and in E’’ with respect to frequency can be associated with the glass transition, which corresponds to the ability of chains to move past each other. Note that this implies that the glass transition is dependent on strain rate in addition to temperature. Secondary transitions may be observed as well.

The [[Maxwell material|Maxwell model]] provides a convenient, if not strictly accurate, description of viscoelastic materials. Applying a sinusoidal stress to a Maxwell model gives: &lt;math&gt; E'' = \frac{E \tau_0 \omega}{\tau_0^2 \omega^2 + 1} ,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\tau_0 = \eta/E&lt;/math&gt; is the Maxwell relaxation time. Thus, a peak in E’’ is observed at the frequency &lt;math&gt;1/\tau_0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt; A real polymer may have several different relaxation times associated with different molecular motions.

====Dynamic stress–strain studies====

By gradually increasing the amplitude of oscillations, one can perform a dynamic stress–strain measurement. The variation of storage and loss moduli with increasing stress can be used for materials characterization, and to determine the upper bound of the material’s linear stress–strain regime.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

====Combined sweep====
Because glass transitions and secondary transitions are seen in both frequency studies and temperature studies, there is interest in multidimensional studies, where temperature sweeps are conducted at a variety of frequencies or frequency sweeps are conducted at a variety of temperatures. This sort of study provides a rich characterization of the material, and can lend information about the nature of the molecular motion responsible for the transition.

For instance, studies of [[polystyrene]] (T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 110&amp;nbsp;°C) have noted a secondary transition near room temperature. Temperature-frequency studies showed that the transition temperature is largely frequency-independent, suggesting that this transition results from a motion of a small number of atoms; it has been suggested that this is the result of the rotation of the [[phenyl]] group around the main chain.&lt;ref name = "Young" /&gt;

A second coupling beam induces EIT and creates a "window" in the absorption region (red). This plot is a computer simulation of EIT in an InAs/GaAs quantum dot]]
'''Electromagnetically induced transparency''' ('''EIT''') is a [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] [[optics|optical]] [[Nonlinear optics|nonlinearity]] which renders a medium [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] within a narrow [[spectrum|spectral]] range around an [[absorption line]].  Extreme [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] is also created within this transparency "window" which leads to "[[slow light]]", described below.  It is in essence a quantum interference effect that permits the propagation of light through an otherwise opaque atomic medium.&lt;ref&gt;Observation of coherent optical information storage in an atomic medium using halted light pulses http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038/35054017&lt;/ref&gt;

Observation of EIT involves two optical fields (highly coherent light sources, such as [[laser]]s) which are tuned to interact with three [[quantum state]]s of a material.  The "probe" field is tuned near resonance between two of the states and measures the [[absorption spectrum]] of the transition.  A much stronger "coupling" field is tuned near resonance at a different transition.  If the states are selected properly, the presence of the coupling field will create a spectral "window" of transparency which will be detected by the probe.  The coupling laser is sometimes referred to as the "control" or "pump", the latter in analogy to incoherent optical nonlinearities such as [[spectral hole burning]] or saturation.

EIT is based on the destructive interference of the transition [[probability amplitude]] between atomic states. Closely related to EIT are [[coherent population trapping]] (CPT) phenomena.

The quantum interference in EIT can be exploited to [[laser cooling|laser cool]] atomic particles, even down to the quantum mechanical ground state of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Medium requirements ==
[[Image:EIT schemes.jpg|left|thumb|350px|EIT level schemes can be sorted into three categories; vee, ladder, and lambda.]]

There are specific restrictions on the configuration of the three states.  Two of the three possible transitions between the states must be "dipole allowed", i.e. the [[transition rule|transitions can be induced]] by an oscillating electric field.  The third transition must be "dipole forbidden."  One of the three states is connected to the other two by the two optical fields.  The three types of EIT schemes are differentiated by the energy differences between this state and the other two.  The schemes are the ladder, vee, and lambda.  Any real material system may contain many triplets of states which could theoretically support EIT, but there are several practical limitations on which levels can actually be used.

Also important are the dephasing rates of the individual states.  In any real system at non-zero temperature there are processes which cause a scrambling of the phase of the quantum states. In the gas phase, this means usually collisions. In solids, dephasing is due to  interaction of the electronic states with the host lattice. The dephasing of state &lt;math&gt;|3\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is especially important; ideally &lt;math&gt;|3\rangle&lt;/math&gt; should be a robust, metastable state.

Current EIT research uses atomic systems in dilute gases, solid solutions, or more exotic states such as [[Bose–Einstein condensate]].  EIT has been demonstrated in electromechanical&lt;ref&gt;Teufel, John D., et al. "Circuit cavity electromechanics in the strong-coupling regime." Nature 471.7337 (2011): 204-208.&lt;/ref&gt; and optomechanical&lt;ref&gt;Safavi-Naeini, Amir H., et al. "Electromagnetically induced transparency and slow light with optomechanics." Nature 472.7341 (2011): 69-73.&lt;/ref&gt; systems, where it is known as [[optomechanically induced transparency]]. Work is also being done in semiconductor nanostructures such as [[quantum well]]s, [[quantum wire]]s and [[quantum dot]]s. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Theory ==
EIT was first proposed theoretically by professor Jakob Khanin and graduate student [[Olga Kocharovskaya]] at [[N. I. Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky State University]] (present: Nizhny Novgorod), Russia;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=3722 |title=Texas A&amp;M University physicists have devised a way to stop light &amp;#124; SpaceRef - Your Space Reference |publisher=SpaceRef |date=2001-01-31 |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  there are now several different approaches to a theoretical treatment of EIT.  One approach is to extend the [[density matrix]] treatment used to derive [[Rabi oscillation]] of a two-state, single field system.  In this picture the [[probability amplitude]] for the system to transfer between states can [[Interference (wave propagation)#Quantum interference|interfere destructively]], preventing absorption.  In this context, "interference" refers to interference between ''quantum events'' (transitions) and not optical interference of any kind. As a specific example, consider the lambda scheme shown above.  Absorption of the probe is defined by transition from &lt;math&gt;|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;|2\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.  The fields can drive population from &lt;math&gt;|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;|2\rangle&lt;/math&gt; directly or from &lt;math&gt;|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;|2\rangle&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;|3\rangle&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;|2\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.  The probability amplitudes for the different paths interfere destructively.  If &lt;math&gt;|3\rangle&lt;/math&gt; has a comparatively long lifetime, then the result will be a transparent window completely inside of the &lt;math&gt;|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;|2\rangle&lt;/math&gt; absorption line.

Another approach is the "[[Light dressed state|dressed state]]" picture, wherein the system + coupling field [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is diagonalized and the effect on the probe is calculated in the new basis.  In this picture EIT resembles a combination of [[Autler-Townes splitting]] and [[Fano interference]] between the dressed states.  Between the doublet peaks, in the center of the transparency window, the quantum probability amplitudes for the probe to cause a transition to either state cancel.

A [[polariton]] picture is particularly important in describing stopped light schemes.  Here, the [[photons]] of the probe are coherently "transformed" into "dark state polaritons" which are [[excited state|excitations]] of the medium. These excitations exist (or can be "stored") for a length of time dependent only on the dephasing rates.

== Slow light and stopped light==
[[Image:EIT dispersion.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Rapid change of index of refraction (blue) in a region of rapidly changing absorption (gray) associated with EIT. The steep and &lt;u&gt;positive&lt;/u&gt; linear region of the refractive index in the center of the transparency window gives rise to slow light]]
It is important to realize that EIT is only one of many diverse mechanisms which can produce [[slow light]].  The [[Kramers–Kronig relation]]s dictate that a change in absorption (or gain) over a narrow spectral range must be accompanied by a change in refractive index over a similarly narrow region.  This rapid and ''positive'' change in refractive index produces an extremely low [[group velocity]].&lt;ref&gt;Matsko A.B., Kocharovskaya O., Rostovtsev Y., Welch G.R., Zibrov A.S., Scully M.O., "Slow, ultraslow, stored, and frozen light", ADVANCES IN ATOMIC, MOLECULAR, AND OPTICAL PHYSICS, VOL 46,  191-242, (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  The first experimental observation of the low group velocity produced by EIT was by Boller, [[Ataç İmamoğlu|İmamoğlu]], and Harris at Stanford University in 1991 in [[strontium]]. In 1999 [[Lene Hau]] reported slowing light in a medium of ultracold [[sodium]] atoms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicscentral.com/explore/people/hau.cfm |title=Lene Hau |publisher=Physicscentral.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  achieving this by using quantum interference effects responsible for electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT).&lt;ref&gt;http://uw.physics.wisc.edu/~timbie/P325/Cohen_stopping_light.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Her group performed copious research regarding EIT with [[Stephen E. Harris]]. "Using detailed numerical simulations, and analytical theory, we study properties of micro-cavities which incorporate materials that exhibit Electro-magnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) or Ultra Slow Light (USL). We find that such systems, while being miniature in size (order wavelength), and integrable, can have some outstanding properties. In particular, they could have lifetimes orders of magnitude longer than other existing systems, and could exhibit non-linear all-optical switching at single photon power levels. Potential applications include miniature atomic clocks, and all-optical quantum information processing." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=850292 |title=SPIE &amp;#124; Proceeding &amp;#124; Electromagnetically induced transparency in microcavities |doi=10.1117/12.562304 |publisher=Proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current record for slow light in an EIT medium is held by Budker, Kimball, Rochester, and Yashchuk at U.C. Berkeley in 1999.  Group velocities as low as 8&amp;nbsp;m/s were measured in a warm thermal [[rubidium]] vapor.&lt;ref&gt;D. Budker, D. F. Kimball, S. M. Rochester, and V. V. Yashchuk, "Nonlinear Magneto-optics and Reduced Group Velocity of Light in Atomic Vapor with Slow Ground State Relaxation", Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, pg. 1767-1770 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Stopped'' light, in the context of an EIT medium, refers to the ''coherent'' transfer of photons to the quantum system and back again.  In principle, this involves switching ''off'' the coupling beam in an [[adiabatic process (quantum mechanics)|adiabatic]] fashion while the probe pulse is still inside of the EIT medium.  There is experimental evidence of trapped pulses in EIT medium. In &lt;ref&gt;Bajcsy M, Zibrov A.S, Lukin M.D., "Stationary pulses of light in an atomic medium", NATURE, '''426''', 638-641, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; authors created a [[stationary light pulse]] inside the atomic coherent media. In 2009 researchers from Harvard University and MIT demonstrated a few-photon optical switch for quantum optics based on the slow light ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Bajcsy M, Hofferberth S, Balic V, Peyronel T,  Hafezi M, Zibrov A.S, Vuletic V, Lukin M.D.,  "All-Optical Switching Using Slow Light within a Hollow Fiber", Phys. Rev. Lett., '''102''', 20390, (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lene Hau]] and a team from Harvard University were the first to  demonstrate stopped light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v445/n7128/abs/nature05493.html |title=Coherent control of optical information with matter wave dynamics : Abstract |publisher=Nature |date= |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Epitech was created in 1999, taking advantage of the keen interest of the ''[[École Pour l'Informatique et les Techniques Avancées]]'' to train students with a specific interest for computer sciences related matter only.

In 2007, Epitech opened new campuses in [[Casablanca]], [[Dalian]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Lille]], [[Lyon]], [[Nantes]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Toulouse]].
Since January 2008, the degree delivered has been recognized by the ''[[Commission nationale de la certification professionnelle]]'',&lt;ref name="arrete"&gt;{{cite web| title=Arrêté du 16 janvier 2008 portant enregistrement au répertoire national des certifications professionnelles | location=France | language=French| url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=FADF1CA86320AE687B52F19AB774F9F8.tpdjo13v_3?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000017981284&amp;categorieLien=id | date=24 January 2008 | accessdate=10 October 2013 | publisher=[Legifrance.gouv.fr] }}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Nomenclature des niveaux de formation|level 1]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rncp.cncp.gouv.fr/grand-public/visualisationFiche?format=fr&amp;fiche=5588 Le Répertoire National des Certifications Professionnelles (RNCP) - Résumé descriptif de la certification]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, the campuses of [[Nice]], [[Montpellier]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Marseille]] and [[Rennes]] were opened.
Since 2009, the school has been recognized by France.&lt;ref name="legifrance" /&gt;

=== New campuses abroad ===
In early 2013, Epitech announced it would open a campus in [[Beijing]], [[China]] in September 2013 and further international branches in [[California]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Spain]] by September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Le groupe d'enseignement privé Ionis s'ancre à l'international |url=http://www.lemondeinformatique.fr/actualites/lire-le-groupe-d-enseignement-prive-ionis-s-ancre-a-l-international-52506.html |date=15 February 2013 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2016|1}}

== Partnership ==
EPITECH has partnered with the ''Zup de Co'' association to create the ''[[Web@cademie]]'', a 2-year training completely free for students without the [[French Baccalaureate]] and with a strong motivation in [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://pro.01net.com/editorial/588287/la-web-academie-accueille-sa-troisieme-promotion-d-eleves-decrocheurs/ La Web Académie accueille sa troisième promotion d’élèves « décrocheurs »]&lt;/ref&gt; This course has the goal to attain a job of [[software developer]] for young people who have stopped their regular studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lemouv.fr/diffusion-une-ecole-unique-en-france-la-web-academie Une école unique en France: la "web académie"]&lt;/ref&gt; They are trained by EPITECH teachers at [[Le Kremlin-Bicêtre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.liberation.fr/societe/0101645556-l-ecole-qui-reconnecte-les-decrocheurs L'école qui reconnecte les décrocheurs]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.digischool.fr/formation/la-webcademie-ouvrira-ses-portes-a-lyon-en-avril-2013-13694.php La Web@cademie ouvrira ses portes à Lyon en avril 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diploma ==
At the end of the five-year course, students receive the title of "Expert of Information Technologies" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.epitech.eu/blogs/diplome-epitech-homologue-niveau1-bac-5-art445.html&lt;/ref&gt; who is recognized by French [[Commission Nationale de la Certification Professionnelle|CNCP]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.letudiant.fr/etudes/ecole-ingenieur/ma-vie-detudiant-en-ecole-dinformatique-selon-zeid-en-3e-annee-a-epitech-13172/apres-epitech-quelle-insertion-professionnelle-17157.html&lt;/ref&gt; Because the school is not certified by the [[Commission des Titres d'Ingénieur]], this professional certification should not be confused in France with a degree of master (like an engineering diploma or a master diploma of public french universities)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cci-paris-idf.fr/formation/orientation-jeunes/reussir-son-orientation-professionnelle/comment-savoir-diplome-reconnu-par-etat-ou-entreprises-formation&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8926">[[Image:EventChain.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Event chain diagram]]'''Event chain diagrams''' are visualizations that show the relationships between events and tasks and how the events affect each other. 

Event chain diagrams are introduced as a part of [[event chain methodology]]. Event chain methodology is an uncertainty modeling and schedule [[network theory|network analysis]] technique that is focused on identifying and managing events and event chains that affect project schedules. Event chain methodology is the next advance beyond [[critical path method]] and [[critical chain]] project management.

== Rules ==
Event chain diagrams are presented on the [[Gantt chart]] according to the specification.
This specification is a set of rules, which can be understood by anybody using this diagram.

=== For Single Events ===
[[File:Event ChainDiagrams- Local and global risks.png|thumb|320px|Event ChainDiagrams: Local and global threats and opportunities with pre- and post mitigation probabilities and impacts]]
# Single events are shown as arrows on the bars on a Gantt Chart. Arrows pointing down represent threats. Arrows pointing up on the Gantt chart represent opportunities or event “Risk Response Plan is executed”. Two arrows in one point represent both threats and opportunities for one risk. The particular horizontal position of the arrow on the Gantt bar is not relevant.
# Issues are shown as arrow in the circle Color of the issue arrow is red (dark)
# Closed or transferred risks are shown using dashed lines. Color of arrow is white. Closed issue is shown in the circle with dashed border line. 
# Global threats are shown at the top of the diagrams pointing down, global opportunities are shown at the bottom of diagrams pointing up. Both threats and opportunities belonging to the same global risk are placed at the top and at the bottom of the diagram along the same vertical line.
# Time-dependent global risks, or risks affecting activities running during certain period time, would have a vertical dashed line, associated with them. Statistical distribution for moment of risk can be shown around that arrow, representing time-dependent global risk.
# Colors of arrows represent the calculated the impact of the risk. Risks with higher are presented as red or dark arrows. Risks with low impact are presented as green or light arrows. The size of the arrow represents probability. If the arrow is small, the probability of the event is correspondingly small. Risk probability and impacts are before mitigation unless it otherwise explicitly noted on the diagram.
# Many different risks can be shown on the same Gantt bar. If there is no space to show all arrows, some risks with lower probability and impact can be omitted.

=== For Event Chains ===
[[File:Event Chain Diagrams - Two event chains.png|thumb|320px|Event Chain Diagrams - Two event chains, one of the triggers an activity]]
# Event chains are shown as lines connecting arrows depicting events. Both curved line or line containing multiple straight segments are acceptable.
# If one event triggers another event, event chain lines will have an arrow, pointing to the triggered event. If an event chain line does not have any arrows, it means that chain does not have any triggers, just events are correlated with each other.
# Correlation coefficient or probability that one event is triggered by another event is presented on event chain in the rectangular box.
# Event chains may trigger another activity. In this case event chain line will be connected with the beginning of activity with optional arrow.
# Event chains may trigger a group of activities. In this case this group of activities will be surrounded by the box or frame and event chain line will be connected to the corner of the box or first activity within a frame.


Often event chain diagrams can become very complex. In these cases, some details of the diagram do not need to be shown.

== Optional rules ==
[[File:Event Chain Diagrams - Risk Response Plans.png|320px|thumb|Event Chain Diagrams: execution of risk response plan (shows ground and excited states of the activity)]]
# Excited states are represented by elevating the associated section of the bar on the Gantt chart. The height of the state’s rectangle represents the relative impact of the event. All excited state of activities should have a textual description. Only states  that have different event subscriptions than ground states should be shown.
# Statistical distribution of moment of risk may be shown above activity bar. Is it not recommended not to show uniform distributions for moment of risk as they are the default in many cases.
# Name of risk can be written next to the arrow and highlighted if probability and impact or risk ID written as well. Sometimes the same risk will be assigned to different tasks. In this case the name of risk will be the same for different arrows pointing to different bars.
# Risk probability and impact can be written next to the arrow. It is possible to cut names “Probability:” to “Prob:”, or just “P:”, and “Impact:” to “Imp:”, or just “I:”.
# Before mitigation and after mitigation risk probability and impact can be written together separated by slash “/”. For, example: “P: 50%/40%” means “Probability before mitigation is 50%; Probability after mitigation is 40%”
# Risk ID can be written next to the arrow.
# Event chains have a textual description
# Different event chains are presented using different color or line types

The central purpose of event chain diagrams is not to show all possible individual events. Rather, event chain diagrams can be used to understand the relationship between events. Therefore, it is recommended the event chain diagrams be used only for the most significant events during the event identification and analysis stage. Event chain diagrams can be used as part of the risk identification process, particularly during brainstorming meetings. Members of project teams can draw arrows between associated with activities on the Gantt chart. Event chain diagrams can be used together with other diagramming tools.

The simplest way to represent these chains is to depict them as arrows associated with certain tasks or time intervals on the Gantt chart. Different events and event chains can be displayed using different colors. Events can be global (for all tasks in the project) and local (for a particular task). By using event chain diagrams to visualize events and event chains, the modeling and analysis of risks and uncertainties can be significantly simplified.

== State Tables == 
[[File:StateTable.png|320px|thumb|State table show states of activity with their properties and subscriptions]]
Another tool that can be used to simplify the definition of events is a state table. Columns in the state table represent events; rows represent the states of an activity. Information for each event in each state includes four properties of event subscription: probability, moment of event, excited state, and impact of the event. State tables help to depict an activity’s subscription to the events: if a cell is empty the state is not subscribed to the event.

The ground state of the activity is subscribed to two events: “architectural changes” and “development tools issue”. If either of these events occurs, they transform the activity to a new excited state called “refactoring”. “Refactoring” is subscribed to another event: “minor requirement change”. Two previous events are not subscribed to the refactoring state and therefore cannot reoccur while the activity is in this state.

[[File:Louis Pasteur, Archives Photographiques.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis Pasteur]], Archives Photographiques]]
The '''fermentation theory''' was studied in depth and brought to light first by [[Louis Pasteur]]. This theory states that it is the idea or concept of how fermentation is brought on by microbes and put to the concept of spontaneous generation to rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pasteur|first=Louis|title=Physiological Theory of Fermentation|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1879pasteur-ferment.asp|publisher=Fordham University|accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though this theory is now outdated and has been replaced by the [[germ theory of disease]], for a long time it held true, and Louis was on the forefront of explaining why it seemed organisms appeared out of nothing instead of claiming it was just a spontaneous act of God. Fermentation was a process that has been used for thousands of years, but no one could explain exactly what was happening and why. From Pasteur's discovery of why and how fermentation occurs, the process has been studied intensely and is now a mastered art used in everyday life with processes of making things such as alcoholic beverages, some foods like yogurt or even manufacturing some medications.&lt;ref name=Viking&gt;{{cite web|last=Fiachson|first=Refr|title=Fermentation in Theory and Practice|url=http://vikingfoodguy.com/wordpress/papers/fermentation-in-theory-and-practice/|publisher=Viking Food Guy|accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evolving science"&gt;{{cite book|last=Slonczewski|first=Joan|title=Microbiology: An Evolving Science 2nd edition|year=2009|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fermentation==
[[File:Gemischte Säuregärung.svg|thumb|Process of [[Fermentation]]]]
Simply put, [[fermentation]] is the anaerobic metabolic process that converts sugar into acids, gases, or alcohols. This metabolic process is used in oxygen starved environments. Yeast and many other microbes commonly use this process in order to carry our their [[anaerobic respiration]] to survive. Even the human body carries out fermentation processes from time to time. When someone runs a long distance race, lactic acid will build up in their muscles over the course of the race. That lactic acid is the by-product of fermentation taking place in their body, which tries to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] so the body can continue to run since they could not process the oxygen intake fast enough. Although fermentation will give a lower yield of ATP production than aerobic respiration does, it can occur at a much higher rate.
Fermentation has been used by humans consciously since around 5000 BCE where there were jars recovered in the Iran [[Zagros Mountains]] area in which contained remnants of a microbes similar those present in the process of making grapes into wine.
[[File:Fermentation lock.JPG|thumb|left|Example of a typical curved neck used today]]

==What the Theory is==
Before the 1870s, when Pasteur published his work on this theory, it was believed that microorganisms and even some small animals such as frogs would spontaneously appear, which was coined as [[spontaneous generation]]. Spontaneous generation was the explained theory that when elements of the Earth such as clay or mud would mix with water and sunlight in certain amounts, creatures would just appear out of that concoction. A common way that this idea was "proven" over and over again was by taking a piece of raw meat and placing it in open air, which would almost always produce maggots. This idea was accepted and believe to be true before Louis Pasteur shook the Earth with his new ideas that organisms actually came from traceable beginnings.&lt;ref name="evolving science"/&gt; Pasteur demonstrated that fermentation is caused by the growth of microorganisms, and the emergent growth of bacteria in nutrient broths is due to [[biogenesis]] rather than spontaneous generation. He exposed boiled broths to air in vessels that contained a filter to prevent all particles from passing through to the growth medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbott|first=David|title=Louis Pasteur|url=http://enlightenmentindividuals.weebly.com/germ-theory-of-fermentation.html|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, when the vessels were open to the air surrounding it, the organisms appeared. It could be concluded that spontaneous generation could be disproven. The organisms did not just appear but were coming from the air, yet we were not able to see them at such a small level. His famous experiment was used with a curved neck placed on top of a beaker. This curved neck was the key to proving his findings because it showed that the germs and microbes had to fall into the broth inside. The curved neck did not allow this to happen.

The '''fermentation theory''' of [[disease]] is the (now obsolete) concept that many diseases, including the diseases which were "epidemic, endemic and contagious", owe their origin to the presence of a "morbific principle" in the system, acting in a manner analogous to, although not identical with, the process of [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]. It was rendered obsolete by the [[germ theory of disease]], which led to the new science of [[bacteriology]].

==Application==
Fermenting a broth in a beaker has become more than just a way to prove that organisms don't just appear out of thin air. Today, the process of fermentation is used for a multitude of everyday applications. Some of those processes include medications which we ingest, beverages we consume, and even food we eat. Currently, companies like [[Genencor]] International uses the production of enzymes involved in fermentation to build a revenue of over $400 million a year.&lt;ref name="evolving science"/&gt; Many medications such as antibiotics are produced by the fermentation process. An example is the important drug [[cortisone]], which can be prepared by the fermentation of a plant steroid known as [[diosgenin]]. [[File:Burton Union fermentation system, Coors Visitor Centre - geograph.org.uk - 476438.jpg|thumb|Burton Union fermentation system, Coors Visitor Centre]]
The enzymes used in the reaction are provided by the mold [[Rhizopus nigricans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fermentation Uses|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/2677/Fermentation-Uses.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as it is commonly known, alcohol of all types and brands are also produced by way of fermentation and [[distillation]]. [[Moonshine]] is a classic example of how this is carried out. Finally, foods such as yogurt are made by fermentation processes as well. Yogurt is a fermented milk product that contains the characteristic bacterial cultures [[Lactobacillus bulgaricus]] and Streptococcus thermopiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milk Facts|url=http://www.milkfacts.info/Milk%20Processing/Yogurt%20Production.htm|work=Yogurt Production|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''graph isomorphism problem''' is the [[computational problem]] of determining whether two finite [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]].

The problem is not known to be solvable in [[polynomial time]] nor to be [[NP-complete]], and therefore may be in the computational [[complexity class]] [[NP-intermediate]].  It is known that the graph isomorphism problem is in the [[low hierarchy]] of [[class NP]], which implies that it is not NP-complete unless the [[polynomial time hierarchy]] collapses to its second level.{{sfnp|Schöning|1987}}  At the same time, isomorphism for many special classes of graphs can be solved in polynomial time, and in practice graph isomorphism can often be solved efficiently.{{sfnp|McKay|1981}}

This problem is a special case of the [[subgraph isomorphism problem]],{{sfnp|Ullman|1976}} which asks whether a given graph ''G'' contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to another given graph ''H'' and which is known to be NP-complete. It is also known to be a special case of the [[Abelian group|non-abelian]] [[hidden subgroup problem]] over the [[symmetric group]].{{sfnp|Moore|Russell|Schulman|2008}}

In the area of [[image recognition]] it is known as the [[exact graph matching]].&lt;ref name=endikaCh2&gt;Endika Bengoetxea, [http://www.sc.ehu.es/acwbecae/ikerkuntza/these/ "Inexact Graph Matching Using Estimation of Distribution Algorithms"], Ph.
 D., 2002, [http://www.sc.ehu.es/acwbecae/ikerkuntza/these/Ch2.pdf Chapter 2:The graph matching problem] (retrieved June 28, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==State of the art==
The best currently accepted theoretical algorithm is due to {{harvtxt|Babai|Luks|1983}}, and is based on the earlier work by {{harvtxt|Luks|1982}} combined with a ''subfactorial'' algorithm of V. N. Zemlyachenko {{harv|Zemlyachenko|Korneenko|Tyshkevich|1985}}.  The algorithm has run time 2&lt;sup&gt;O({{sqrt|''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n''}})&lt;/sup&gt; for graphs with ''n'' vertices and relies on the [[classification of finite simple groups]]. Without CFSG, a slightly weaker bound 
{{math|2&lt;sup&gt;O({{sqrt|''n''}}&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;|size=100%}} was obtained first for [[strongly regular graph]]s by {{harvs|authorlink=László Babai|first=László|last=Babai|year=1980|txt}}, and then extended to general graphs by {{harvtxt|Babai|Luks|1983}}.  Improvement of the exponent {{sqrt|''n''}} is a major open problem; for strongly regular graphs this was done by {{Harvtxt|Spielman|1996}}.  For [[hypergraph]]s of bounded rank, a [[Sub-exponential time|subexponential]] upper bound matching the case of graphs was obtained by {{Harvtxt|Babai|Codenotti|2008}}.

In November 2015, Babai announced a [[Time complexity#Quasi-polynomial time|quasipolynomial time]] algorithm for all graphs, that is, one with running time &lt;math&gt;2^{O((\log n)^c)}&lt;/math&gt; for some fixed &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mathematician claims breakthrough in complexity theory|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/math/2015/11/mathematician-claims-breakthrough-complexity-theory|work=Science|date=Nov 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Babai|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~laci/  Video of first 2015 lecture linked from Babai's home page]&lt;/ref&gt; On January 4, 2017, Babai retracted the quasi-polynomial claim and stated a [[sub-exponential time]] bound instead after [[Harald Helfgott]] discovered a flaw in the proof. On January 9, 2017, Babai announced a correction (published in full on January 19) and restored the quasi-polynomial claim, with Helfgott confirming the fix.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Babai|first= László|url=http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~laci/update.html|title=Graph isomorphism update|date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Erika Klarreich}}, ''Graph Isomorphism Vanquished — Again'', Quanta Magazine,  January 14, 2017 [https://www.quantamagazine.org/20170114-graph-isomorphism-babai-fix/ see here]&lt;/ref&gt;  Helfgott further claims that one can take {{math|1=''c'' = 3}}, so the running time is {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;O((log ''n'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Helfgott|first=Harald|arxiv=1701.04372|title=Isomorphismes de graphes en temps quasi-polynomial (d'après Babai et Luks, Weisfeiler-Leman...)|date=January 16, 2017|bibcode=2017arXiv170104372A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new proof has not been fully peer-reviewed yet.

There are several competing practical algorithms for graph isomorphism, such as those due to {{harvtxt|McKay|1981}}, {{harvtxt|Schmidt|Druffel|1976}}, and {{harvtxt|Ullman|1976}}.  While they seem to perform well on [[random graphs]], a major drawback of these algorithms is their exponential time performance in the [[Best, worst and average case|worst case]].{{sfnp|Foggia|Sansone|Vento|2001}}

The graph isomorphism problem is computationally equivalent to the problem of computing the [[automorphism group]] of a graph, and is weaker than the [[permutation group]] isomorphism problem and the permutation group intersection problem.  For the latter two problems, {{harvtxt|Babai|Kantor|Luks|1983}} obtained complexity bounds similar to that for graph isomorphism.

==Solved special cases==
A number of important special cases of the graph isomorphism problem have efficient, polynomial-time solutions:
* [[Tree (graph theory)|Tree]]s{{sfnp|Kelly|1957}}{{sfnp|Aho|Hopcroft|Ullman|1974|p=84-86}}
* [[Planar graph]]s{{sfnp|Hopcroft|Wong|1974}} (In fact, planar graph isomorphism is in [[L (complexity)|log space]],{{sfnp|Datta|Limaye|Nimbhorkar|Thierauf|2009}} a class contained in [[P (complexity)|P]])
* [[Interval graph]]s{{sfnp|Booth|Lueker|1979}}
* [[Permutation graph]]s{{sfnp|Colbourn|1981}}
* [[Circulant graph]]s{{sfnp|Muzychuk|2004}}
*Bounded-parameter graphs
** Graphs of bounded [[treewidth]]{{sfnp|Bodlaender|1990}}
** Graphs of bounded [[genus (mathematics)|genus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1980}}; {{harvnb|Filotti|Mayer|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: planar graphs are graphs of genus 0)
** Graphs of bounded [[degree (graph theory)|degree]]{{sfnp|Luks|1982}}
** Graphs with bounded [[eigenvalue]] multiplicity{{sfnp|Babai|Grigoryev|Mount|1982}}
** ''k''-Contractible graphs (a generalization of bounded degree and bounded genus){{sfnp|Miller|1983}}
**Color-preserving isomorphism of [[colored graph]]s with bounded color multiplicity (i.e., at most ''k'' vertices have the same color for a fixed ''k'') is in class [[NC (complexity)|NC]], which is a subclass of [[P (complexity)|P]]{{sfnp|Luks|1986}}

== Complexity class GI ==&lt;!-- [[GI]] links and [[GI (complexity)]] redirects to this section --&gt;
Since the graph isomorphism problem is neither known to be NP-complete nor known to be tractable, researchers have sought to gain insight into the problem by defining a new class '''GI''', the set of problems with a [[polynomial-time Turing reduction]] to the graph isomorphism problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Booth|Colbourn|1977}}; {{harvnb|Köbler|Schöning|Torán|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If in fact the graph isomorphism problem is solvable in polynomial time, '''GI''' would equal '''[[P (complexity)|P]]'''.

As is common for [[complexity class]]es within the [[polynomial time hierarchy]], a problem is called '''GI-hard''' if there is a [[polynomial-time Turing reduction]] from any problem in '''GI''' to that problem, i.e.,  a polynomial-time solution to a GI-hard problem would yield a polynomial-time solution to the graph isomorphism problem (and so all problems in '''GI''').  A problem &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called [[complete (complexity)|complete]] for '''GI''', or '''GI-complete''', if it is both GI-hard and a polynomial-time solution to the GI problem would yield a polynomial-time solution to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

The graph isomorphism problem is contained in both '''NP''' and co-'''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]'''. GI is contained in and [[low (complexity)|low]] for [[Parity P]], as well as contained in the potentially much smaller class [https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:S#spp SPP].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Köbler|Schöning|Torán|1992}}; {{harvnb|Arvind|Kurur|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; That it lies in Parity P means that the graph isomorphism problem is no harder than determining whether a polynomial-time [[nondeterministic Turing machine]] has an even or odd number of accepting paths. GI is also contained in and low for [[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]&lt;sup&gt;NP&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfnp|Arvind|Köbler|2000}} This essentially means that an efficient [[Las Vegas algorithm]] with access to an NP [[oracle machine|oracle]] can solve graph isomorphism so easily that it gains no power from being given the ability to do so in constant time.

===GI-complete and GI-hard problems===

====Isomorphism of other objects====
There are a number of classes of mathematical objects for which the problem of isomorphism is a GI-complete problem. A number of them are graphs endowed with additional properties or restrictions:&lt;ref name=zkt&gt;{{harvtxt|Zemlyachenko|Korneenko|Tyshkevich|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Directed graph|digraphs]]&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;

*"polarized graphs" (made of a [[complete graph]] K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and an [[empty graph]] K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; plus some edges connecting the two; their isomorphism must preserve the partition)&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;
*2-[[colored graph]]s&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;

{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}

====GI-complete classes of graphs====
A class of graphs is called GI-complete if recognition of isomorphism for graphs from this subclass is a GI-complete problem. The following classes are GI-complete:&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;
*[[connected graph]]s&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;&lt;!-- better to be replaced by original ref--&gt;
*graphs of [[diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] 2 and [[radius (graph theory)|radius]] 1&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;
*[[directed acyclic graph]]s&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;&lt;!-- better to be replaced by original ref--&gt;
*[[regular graph]]s&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;&lt;!-- better to be replaced by original ref--&gt;
*[[bipartite graph]]s without non-trivial [[strongly regular graph|strongly regular subgraphs]]&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;&lt;!-- better to be replaced by original ref--&gt;
*bipartite [[Eulerian graph]]s&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;&lt;!-- better to be replaced by original ref--&gt;

*[[line graph]]s&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;&lt;!-- better to be replaced by original ref--&gt;
*[[split graph]]s{{sfnp|Chung|1985}}

*regular [[self-complementary graph]]s&lt;ref name=zkt/&gt;&lt;!-- better to be replaced by original ref--&gt;
*[[polytopal graph]]s of general, [[simple polytope|simple]], and [[simplicial polytope|simplicial]] [[convex polytope]]s in arbitrary dimensions.{{sfnp|Kaibel|Schwartz|2003}}
{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}
Many classes of digraphs are also GI-complete.

====Other GI-complete problems====
There are other nontrivial GI-complete problems in addition to isomorphism problems.
*The recognition of self-complementarity of a graph or digraph.{{sfnp|Colbourn|Colbourn|1978}}
*A [[clique problem]] for a class of so-called ''M''-graphs. It is shown that finding an isomorphism for ''n''-vertex graphs is equivalent to finding an ''n''-clique in an ''M''-graph of size ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This fact is interesting because the problem of finding an (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''ε'')-clique in a ''M''-graph  of size ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is NP-complete for arbitrarily small positive ε.{{sfnp|Kozen|1978}}
*The problem of homeomorphism of 2-complexes.{{sfnp|Shawe-Taylor|Pisanski|1994}}

====GI-hard problems====
*The problem of counting the number of isomorphisms between two graphs is polynomial-time equivalent to the problem of telling whether even one exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mathon|1979}}; {{harvnb|Johnson|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The problem of deciding whether two [[convex polytope]]s given by either the [[V-description]] or [[H-description]] are projectively or affinely isomorphic. The latter means existence of a projective or affine map between the spaces that contain the two polytopes (not necessarily of the same dimension) which induces a bijection between the polytopes.{{sfnp|Kaibel|Schwartz|2003}}

==Program checking==

{{harvs|first1=Manuel|last1=Blum|author1-link=Manuel Blum|first2=Sampath|last2=Kannan|year=1995|txt}} have shown a probabilistic checker for programs for  graph isomorphism. Suppose ''P'' is a claimed polynomial-time procedure that checks if two graphs are isomorphic, but it is not trusted. To check if ''G'' and ''H'' are isomorphic:

* Ask ''P'' whether ''G'' and ''H'' are isomorphic.
** If the answer is "yes':
*** Attempt to construct an isomorphism using ''P'' as subroutine. Mark a vertex ''u'' in ''G'' and ''v'' in ''H'', and modify the graphs to make them distinctive (with a small local change). Ask ''P'' if the modified graphs are isomorphic. If no, change ''v'' to a different vertex. Continue searching.
*** Either the isomorphism will be found (and can be verified), or ''P'' will contradict itself.
** If the answer is "no":
*** Perform the following 100 times. Choose randomly ''G'' or ''H'', and randomly permute its vertices. Ask ''P'' if the graph is isomorphic to ''G'' and ''H''. (As in [[AM (complexity)|AM]] protocol for graph nonisomorphism).
*** If any of the tests are failed, judge ''P'' as invalid program. Otherwise, answer "no".

This procedure is polynomial-time and gives the correct answer if ''P'' is a correct program for graph isomorphism. If ''P'' is not a correct program, but answers correctly on ''G'' and ''H'', the checker will either give the correct answer, or detect invalid behaviour of ''P''.
If ''P'' is not a correct program, and answers incorrectly on ''G'' and ''H'', the checker will detect invalid behaviour of ''P'' with high probability, or answer wrong with probability 2&lt;sup&gt;−100&lt;/sup&gt;.

Notably, ''P'' is used only as a blackbox.

== Applications ==

Graphs are commonly used to encode structural information in many fields, including [[computer vision]] and [[pattern recognition]], and [[graph matching]], i.e., identification of similarities between graphs, is an important tools in these areas. In these areas graph isomorphism problem is known as the exact graph matching.&lt;ref name=endikaAbstract&gt;Endika Bengoetxea, Ph.D., [http://www.sc.ehu.es/acwbecae/ikerkuntza/these/ Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cheminformatics]] and in [[mathematical chemistry]], graph isomorphism testing is used to identify a [[chemical compound]] within a [[chemical database]].{{sfnp|Irniger|2005}} Also, in organic mathematical chemistry graph isomorphism testing is useful for generation of [[molecular graph]]s and for [[Combinatorial chemistry|computer synthesis]].

Chemical database search is an example of graphical [[data mining]], where the [[graph canonization]] approach is often used.{{sfnp|Cook|Holder|2007}} In particular, a number of [[identifier]]s for [[chemical substance]]s,  such as [[SMILES]] and [[InChI]], designed to provide a standard and human-readable way to encode molecular information and to facilitate the search for such information in databases and on the web, use canonization step in their computation, which is essentially the canonization of the graph which represents the molecule.

In [[electronic design automation]] graph isomorphism is the basis of the [[Layout Versus Schematic]] (LVS) circuit design step, which is a verification whether the [[electric circuit]]s represented by a [[circuit diagram|circuit schematic]] and an [[integrated circuit layout]] are the same.{{sfnp|Baird|Cho|1975}}

'''Illite crystallinity''' is a technique used to classify low-grade [[metamorphic]] activity in [[pelite|pelitic rock]]s.&lt;ref name="Verdel 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verdel|first1=Charles|first2=Nathan|last2=Niemi|first3= Ben A. |last3=van der Pluijm|title=Variations in the Illite to Muscovite Transition Related to Metamorphic Conditions and Detrital Muscovite Content: Insight from the Paleozoic Passive Margin of the Southwestern United States|journal=The Journal of Geology|year=2011|volume=119|pages=419–437|url=http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/Ben/Publications/11_jgeol_verdel.pdf|accessdate=7 October 2013|bibcode=2011JG....119..419V|doi=10.1086/660086|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining the "''illite crystallinity index''" allows geologists to designate what [[metamorphic facies]] and [[metamorphic zone]] the rock was formed in and to infer what temperature the rock was formed. Several crystallinity indices have been proposed in recent years, but currently the Kübler index is being used due to its reproducibility and simplicity.&lt;ref name="Abad"/&gt; The Kübler index is experimentally determined by measuring the [[full width at half maximum]] for the [[X-ray diffraction]] reflection peak along the [[Miller index|(001)]] [[Rotational symmetry|crystallographic axis]] of the rock sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=D. D. |last1=Eberl |first2=B. |last2=Velde|title=Beyond the Kübler index|journal= Clay Minerals|date=December 1989|volume= 24| pages= 571–577|url=http://www.minersoc.org/pages/Archive-CM/Volume_24/24-4-571.pdf|doi=10.1180/claymin.1989.024.4.01|issue=4|bibcode=1989ClMin..24..571E}}&lt;/ref&gt; This value is an indirect measurement of the thickness of [[illite]]/[[muscovite]] packets which denote a change in metamorphic grade. 
The method can be used throughout the field of geology in areas such as the [[petroleum industry]], [[plate tectonics]].

== Illite crystallinity progression==
As stated above, the Kübler index was not always the preferred index for illite crystallinity studies in the past. Prior to the introduction of the Kübler index, there were several other indices used to classify low grade metamorphic rocks.&lt;ref name="Abad"/&gt; Two of the more popular methods of the past are the Weaver index and the Weber index, introduced in 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://archives.datapages.com/data/bulletns/1957-60/data/pg/0044/0009/1500/1505.htm|title= Possible Uses of Clay Minerals in Search for Oil |first= Charles E.|last=Beaver |journal= American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin |year=1960|pages=1505–1518 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title= Notes on the determination of illite crystallinity |first= K.|last=Weber|journal= Neues Jahrbuch für Mineralogie, Monatshefte |year=1972|pages=267–276|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.&lt;ref name="Abad"/&gt; These studies consist of mainly the same types of methods but vary in their expression of ratio measurements.&lt;ref name="Abad"/&gt; The Kübler index, introduced by Bernard Kübler in 1964 for petroleum exploration and improved on in later years, has come to be the go-to index for illite crystallinity based on its reproducibility and simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kübler |first=Bernard |year=1964|title =Les argiles, indicateurs de métamorphisme|journal= Rev.

==Applications==

Illite crystallinity is useful when trying to determine what type of metamorphic conditions a rock was subjected to during its formation. Illite crystallinity can be used to trace the low grade metamorphic transition from [[zeolite facies]] to [[greenschist facies]] (diagenetic zone to epizone).&lt;ref name="Verdel 2012" /&gt; This change is flagged by the change of thin illite grains to thicker illite/muscovite grains.&lt;ref name="Verdel 2012" /&gt; This low grade metamorphic technique can also be put into use when there is an absence in change of mineral structure which applies to higher grade metamorphism.&lt;ref name="Abad"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.ehu.es/sem/seminario_pdf/SEMINARIOS_SEM_3_53.pdf|chapter=Physical meaning and applications of the illite Kübler index: measuring reaction progress in low-grade metamorphism | accessdate=7 October 2013 | last=Abad|first= Isabel|title=Diagenesis and low-temperature metamorphism. Theory, methods and regional aspects|issn=1698-5478 |editor-last1= Nieto |editor-first2=Juan |editor-last2=Jiménez-Millán|journal= Seminarios de la Sociedad Española de Mineralogía|editor-first= Fernando}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early use of illite crystallinity was in the petroleum industry to determine the transition from a dry gas phase to an unproductive rock. Recently, this technique has expanded in the field and now is used in areas such as palaeotectonics and geodynamic reconstructions.&lt;ref name="Abad"/&gt;

==Rock preparation and methods==
Rock sample preparation for illite crystallinity can vary slightly, but boils down to basically the same steps. Although for accurate returns in testing, consistency of sample preparation is a must.&lt;ref name="Verdel 2011" /&gt; General sample preparation for illite crystallinity is as follows:&lt;ref name="Verdel 2011" /&gt;

# Rinse and dry the field sample
# Crush the sample
# Stir sample into deionized water and let settle overnight to isolate clay sized particles (&lt;2&amp;nbsp;μm)
# Dry supernatant containing &lt;2&amp;nbsp;μm particles
# Mix with deionized water and centrifuge
# Collect supernatant containing &lt;2&amp;nbsp;μm particles
# Centrifuge &lt;2&amp;nbsp;μm particle solution and dry
# Mix with water and deposit on a glass slide

The sample is first broken down, using the steps above, and prepared for XRD analysis. Results from the XRD are then compared to pre-established values assigned to metamorphic zones/metamorphic facies. The targets of the results are the peaks on the XRD plots. Width of the illite XRD peak at one half of its height is collected and recorded with units of ∆ °2θ (XRD angle).&lt;ref name="Verdel 2011" /&gt; Comparison and classification of [[metamorphic facies]] is then determined for the sample.

==Interpreting results==

Illite contains more silicon, iron and magnesium than muscovite, as well as less tetrahedral aluminium and interlayered potassium.&lt;ref name="Verdel 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Verdel 2012" /&gt;

X-Ray diffraction plots provide information on angles and intensities of refracted beams which allow scientists to construct a 3D model of the crystalline structure. The focus of an illite crystallinity XRD plot is the main peak. [[full width at half maximum|Width of the peak at one half of its height]] is measured and this angle (recorded with units of ∆ °2θ),&lt;ref name="Verdel 2011" /&gt; can be plotted on a chart with metamorphic zones and facies like the one in figure 1. If the illite crystallinity values fall in the 0-0.25 °2θ range, it corresponds with a metamorphic epizone or greenschist facies. If the illite crystallinity values fall in the 0.25-0.30 °2θ range, it corresponds with a metamorphic high anchizone or prehnite-pumpellyite facies. If the illite crystallinity values fall in the 0.30-0.42 °2θ range, it corresponds with a metamorphic low anchizone or prehnite-pumpellyite facies. If the illite crystallinity values fall in the 0.42-1.0 °2θ range, it corresponds with a metamorphic deep diagenetic zone or zeolite facies.

The '''illusory truth effect''' (also known as the '''validity effect''', '''truth effect''' or the '''reiteration effect''') is the tendency to believe information to be correct after repeated exposure.&lt;ref name="Science Blogs"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Truth Effect and Other Processing Fluency Miracles|url=http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2007/09/18/the-truth-effect-and-other-pro/|website=Science Blogs|publisher=Science Blogs|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon was first identified in a 1977 study at [[Villanova University]] and [[Temple University]].&lt;ref name="Hasher1977" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PLOS ONE"&gt;{{cite journal|title=People with Easier to Pronounce Names Promote Truthiness of Claims|journal=PLOS ONE|date=September 6, 2014|url=http://www.oalib.com/references/8155256|accessdate=29 December 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0088671}}&lt;/ref&gt; When truth is assessed, people rely on whether the information is in line with their understanding or if it feels familiar. The first condition is logical as people compare new information with what they already know to be true. Repetition makes statements easier to process relative to new, unrepeated, statements, leading people to believe that the repeated conclusion is more truthful. The illusory truth effect has also been linked to "hindsight bias", in which the recollection of confidence is skewed after the truth has been received.

In a 2015 study, researchers discovered that familiarity can overpower rationality and that repetitively hearing that a certain fact is wrong can affect the hearer's beliefs.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; Researchers attributed the illusory truth effect's impact on participants who knew the correct answer to begin with, but were persuaded to believe otherwise through the repetition of a falsehood, to "[[processing fluency]]".

The illusory truth effect plays a significant role in such fields as [[election campaigns]], [[advertising]], [[news media]], and [[propaganda|political propaganda]].

==Initial study==

The effect was first named and defined following the results in a study from 1977 at [[Villanova University]] and [[Temple University]] where participants were asked to rate a series of trivia statements as true or false.&lt;ref name="Hasher1977"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hasher |first1=Lynn |last2=Goldstein |first2=David |last3=Toppino |first3=Thomas |title=Frequency and the conference of referential validity |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior |date=1977 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=107–112 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(77)80012-1 |url=http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/hasher/PDF/Frequency%20and%20the%20conference%20Hasher%20et%20al%201977.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515062305/http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/hasher/PDF/Frequency%20and%20the%20conference%20Hasher%20et%20al%201977.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox"/&gt; On three occasions, Lynn Hasher, David Goldstein, and Thomas Toppino presented the same group of college students with lists of sixty plausible statements, some of them true and some of them false. The second list was distributed two weeks after the first, and the third two weeks after that. Twenty statements appeared on all three lists; the other forty items on each list were unique to that list. Participants were asked how confident they were of the truth or falsity of the statements, which concerned matters about which they were unlikely to know anything. (For example, "The first air force base was launched in New Mexico." Or "[[Basketball]] became an Olympic discipline in 1925.") Specifically, the participants were asked to grade their belief in the truth of each statement on a scale of one to seven. While the participants' confidence in the truth of the non-repeated statements remained steady, their confidence in the truth of the repeated statements increased from the first to the second and second to third sessions, with an average score for those items rising from 4.2 to 4.6 to 4.7. The conclusion made by the researchers, who were from Villanova and Temple universities, was that repeating a statement makes it more likely to appear factual.&lt;ref name="Science Blogs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hasher1977" /&gt;

In 1989, Hal R. Arkes, Catherine Hackett, and Larry Boehm replicated the original study, with similar results showing that exposure to false information changes the perceived truthfulness and plausibility of that information.&lt;ref name="Europe's Journal of Psychology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polage|first1=Danielle|title=Making up History: False Memories of Fake News Stories|journal=Europe's Journal of Psychology|date=May 31, 2012|volume=8|pages=245–250|doi=10.5964/ejop.v8i2.456|url=http://ejop.psychopen.eu/article/viewFile/456/pdf|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect works because when people assess truth, they rely on whether the information agrees with their understanding or whether it feels familiar. The first condition is logical as people compare new information with what they already know to be true and consider the credibility of both sources. However, researchers discovered that familiarity can overpower rationality—so much so that repetitively hearing that a certain fact is wrong can have a paradoxical effect.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

==Relation to other phenomena==
===Processing fluency===
At first, the truth effect was  believed to occur only when individuals are highly uncertain about a given statement.&lt;ref name="Science Blogs"/&gt; Psychologists also assumed that "outlandish" headlines wouldn't produce this effect however, recent research shows the illusory truth effect is indeed at play with false news.&lt;ref name="Vox"/&gt; This assumption was challenged by the results of a 2015 study by Lisa K. Fazio, Nadia M. Brasier, B. Keith Payne, and Elizabeth J. Marsh. Published in the ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology]]'', the study suggested that the truth effect can influence participants who actually knew the correct answer to begin with, but who were swayed to believe otherwise through the repetition of a falsehood. For example, when participants encountered on multiple occasions the statement "A sari is the name of the short plaid skirt worn by Scots," some of them were likely to come to believe it was true, even though these same people were able to correctly answer the question "What is the name of the short pleated skirt worn by Scots?"

After replicating these results in another experiment, Fazio and her team attributed this curious phenomenon to "[[processing fluency]]", a term that describes the facility with which people comprehend statements. "Repetition," explained the researcher, "makes statements easier to process (i.e. fluent) relative to new statements, leading people to the (sometimes) false conclusion that they are more truthful."&lt;ref name="Fazio2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fazio |first1=Lisa K. |last2=Brashier |first2=Nadia M. |last3=Payne |first3=B.

===Hindsight bias===
In a 1997 study, Ralph Hertwig, [[Gerd Gigerenzer]], and Ulrich Hoffrage linked the truth effect to the phenomenon known as "[[hindsight bias]]", described as a situation in which the recollection of confidence is skewed after the truth or falsity has been received. They have described the truth effect (which they call "the reiteration effect") as a subset of hindsight bias.&lt;ref name="Hertwig"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hertwig|first1=Ralph|last2=Gigerenzer|first2=Gerd|last3=Hoffrage|first3=Ulrich|title=The Reiteration Effect in Hindsight Bias|journal=Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition|date=1997|url=https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/volltexte/institut/dok/full/hertwig/hrreipr__/hrreipr__.html|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other studies==
In a 1979 study, participants were told that repeated statements were no more likely to be true than unrepeated ones. Despite this warning, the participants perceived repeated statements as being more true than unrepeated ones.&lt;ref name="Europe's Journal of Psychology"/&gt;

Studies in 1981 and 1983 showed that information deriving from recent experience tends to be viewed as "more fluent and familiar" than new experience. A 2011 study by Jason D. Ozubko and Jonathan Fugelsang built on this finding by demonstrating that, generally speaking, information retrieved from memory is "more fluent or familiar than when it was first learned" and thus produces an illusion of truth. The effect grew even more pronounced when statements were repeated twice and yet more pronounced when they were repeated four times. The researchers thus concluded that memory retrieval is a powerful method for increasing the so-called validity of statements and that the illusion of truth is an effect that can be observed without directly polling the factual statements in question.&lt;ref name="University of Waterloo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ozubko|first1=JD|last2=Fugelsang|first2=J|title=Remembering makes evidence compelling: retrieval from memory can give rise to the illusion of truth.|journal=University of Waterloo|date=January 2011|doi=10.1037/a0021323|pmid=21058878|volume=37|pages=270–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1992 study by Ian Maynard Begg, Ann Anas, and Suzanne Farinacci suggested that a statement will seem true if the information seems familiar.&lt;ref name="Europe's Journal of Psychology"/&gt;

A 2012 experiment by Danielle C. Polage showed that some participants exposed to false news stories would go on to have false memories. The conclusion was that repetitive false claims increase believability and may also result in errors.&lt;ref name="Europe's Journal of Psychology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox"/&gt;

In a 2014 study, Eryn J. Newman, Mevagh Sanson, Emily K. Miller, Adele Quigley-McBride, Jeffrey L. Foster, Daniel M. Bernstein, and [[Maryanne Garry]] asked participants to judge the truth of statements attributed to various people, some of whose names were easier to pronounce than others. Consistently, statements by persons with easily pronounced names were viewed as being more truthful than those with names that were harder to pronounce. The researchers' conclusion was that subjective, tangential properties can matter when people evaluate sourced information.&lt;ref name="PLOS ONE"/&gt;

==Examples==
Although the truth effect has been demonstrated scientifically only in recent years, it is a phenomenon with which people have been familiar for millennia. One study notes that the Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] closed each of his speeches with a call to destroy [[Carthage]] ("''[[Carthago delenda est|Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam]]''"), knowing that the repetition would breed agreement, and that [[Napoleon]] reportedly "said that there is only one figure in rhetoric of serious importance, namely, repetition", whereby a repeated affirmation fixes itself in the mind "in such a way that it is accepted in the end as a demonstrated truth". Others who have taken advantage of the truth effect have included [[Quintilian]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Marcus Antonius]] in [[Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''.&lt;ref name="Hertwig" /&gt;

The truth effect plays a significant role in various fields of activity. During [[election campaigns]], false information about a candidate, if repeated in [[TV commercials]], can cause the public to believe it. Similarly, advertising that repeats unfounded claims about a product may boost sales because some viewers may come to think that they heard the claims from an objective source.&lt;ref name="Europe's Journal of Psychology"/&gt; The truth effect is also used in news media and is a staple of political propaganda.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dreyfuss|first1=Emily|title=Want to Make a Lie Seem True? Say It Again. And Again. And Again.|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/dont-believe-lies-just-people-repeat/|accessdate=31 October 2017|publisher=Wired|date=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Resnick|first1=Brian|title=Alex Jones and the illusory truth effect, explained|url=https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/6/17/15817056/alex-jones-megyn-kelly-lies-nbc-psychology-illusory-truth|website=Vox|publisher=Vox|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[kayaking]] expert has pointed out that it is an accepted fact that when kayaking on the ocean or the [[Great Lakes]], one should use a kayak at least 16 feet long. But this is not true; the best length for a kayak depends on a variety of factors.&lt;ref name="Paddling Light"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hansel|first1=Bryan|title=Illusory Truth Effect and Sea Kayaking (Sort of Off-Topic)|url=http://www.paddlinglight.com/articles/illusory-truth-effect-sea-kayaking-sort-off-topic/|website=Paddling Light|publisher=Paddling Light|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information Rules''' is a 1999 book by [[Carl Shapiro (Economist)|Carl Shapiro]] and [[Hal Varian]] applying traditional economic theories to modern [[Information technology|information-based technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/087584863X&lt;/ref&gt; The book examines commercial strategies appropriate to companies that deal in information, given the high "first copy" and low "subsequent copy" costs of information commodities, such as [[Compact Disc|music CD]]s or original texts.

==Content==
The book examines competing [[De facto standard|standards]], and how a company might influence widespread consumer acceptance of one over another, such as [[VHS]] versus [[Betamax]], or [[HD DVD]] versus [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]. The book mentions possible business strategies of such publishers as [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] who have to confront how to stay viable as technology changes the value and availability of information.

'''International Studies''' ('''IS''') generally refers to the specific university degrees and courses which are concerned with the study of ‘the major political, economic, social, and cultural issues that dominate the international agenda’.&lt;ref&gt;The British International Studies Association (2016). About International Studies. Viewed 3/4/2017 &lt;https://www.bisa.ac.uk/index.php/119-about-international-studies/420-about-international-studies&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Predominant topics are [[politics]], [[economics]] and [[law]] on a global level. The term itself can be more specifically defined as ‘the contemporary and historical understanding of global societies, cultures, languages and systems of government and of the complex relationships between them that shape the world we live in’.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Flinders University. (2010). Bachelor of International Studies. Viewed 21/9/2010 &lt;http://www.flinders.edu.au/courses/undergrad/bis/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The terms and concepts of International Studies and [[international relations]] are strongly related; however, International relations focus more directly on the relationship between countries, whereas International Studies can encompass all phenomena which are globally oriented.

__TOC__

==History==

The history of the discipline of International Studies is strongly linked with the history of the study of international relations, as described in the International Relations entry. However, the study of International Studies as a separate entity to International Relations emerged throughout the 20th century, as an increasingly complex world began to be influenced by [[globalization]], and a greater number of issues emerged (rather than only inter-country relations). The discipline was greatly influenced by the establishment of the International Studies Association,&lt;ref&gt;International Studies Association. (2010). Welcome to ISA. Viewed 21/9/2010  &lt;http://www.isanet.org/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which was established in 1959 by a ‘group of academics and practitioners’&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;International Studies Association. (2010). History and Purpose. Viewed 21/9/2010  &lt; http://www.isanet.org/history_purpose/2007/12/history-of-isa.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of ‘seeking to pursue mutual interests in world affairs through the organization of a professional association’.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The establishment of the association reflected the increasing interest in [[global issue]]s and reflected the need for international academic dialogue.
	Throughout the later stages of the 20th century and into the 21st century, many education institutions worldwide developed International Studies degrees (both undergraduate and postgraduate). The emergence and increasing popularity of these degrees reflect the general patterns of increasing global interconnectedness and globalization, in that education providers, are becoming more aware that the discipline is becoming increasingly relevant and necessary in the context of the 21st century.
	The discipline has become increasingly popular in Australia as well as in East Asian countries. Dr. Hanson and Dr. Weber of the University of Queensland state that;
:‘Australia has become a highly popular destination for students wishing to undertake Coursework, Masters and Ph.D. programs in International Relations, Peace and Conflict Studies and Development. Collectively, these inter-related fields have come to be called International Studies, and many of Australia’s universities have responded to the increasing demand for programs in this area’&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;International Graduate, Australia. (2010). International Studies in Australia. Viewed 21/9/10 &lt; http://www.internationalgraduate.net/country/australia/international-studies-australia.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, the third OCIS conference (Oceanic Conference on International Studies) was held at the University of Queensland’.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The conference brought together over 200 academics, with the keynote speaker Andrew Linklater (the Woodrow Wilson Professor of International Politics at the [[University of Aberystwyth]] in Wales) noting ‘how vibrant and intellectually stimulating International Studies now is in Australia’’.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
The increasing popularity of the discipline in Australia led to the International Studies Association to establish an Asia-Pacific Regional Section of the ISA at the University of Queensland in 2009’,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; which was seen as an ‘indication of the growth of this area’’&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; in Australia.

==Etymology==

International Studies is sometimes also known as [[global studies]]. The terms can be used interchangeably and may be influenced by left vs right inclinations.

==Purpose/aim of study==

Many educational institutions have developed International Studies degrees and courses in order to engage students with the increasing number of issues and phenomena which have arisen in an increasingly globalized world. As such, most education providers justify the need for the degrees by relating the increasing importance of the discipline with real-world situations and employment opportunities.
For example, the University of Technology Sydney states that the purpose of their International Studies degree is to ‘prepare graduates for careers and contributions in a world of social and cultural diversity being transformed by globalisation, allowing students to draw connections between global phenomena and local practices in work and life’.&lt;ref&gt;University of Technology Sydney: Arts and Social Sciences.

Often, universities will relate the study of International studies with other industries. Monash University describes the relevance for International Studies; ‘as the world globalizes and nations and economies become more integrated, it is important to understand our world and the ideas and beliefs of our neighbors and trading partners. In order to compete in the international marketplaces of products, ideas and knowledge we need to understand and respect the cultures and beliefs of others.&lt;ref&gt;’Monash University: Arts.

==Types of programs==

At many universities, International Studies is offered in both undergraduate and postgraduate pathways.

==Types of studies==

The International Studies discipline is usually offered as either part of an arts degree or as a specialist arts degree. As such, students are able to select from a very broad range of subjects to undertake. However, some areas of study which are regularly offered include:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*the political, social, economic and cultural relationships within the international system
*foreign policy, diplomacy and other modes of interaction between the countries of the world
*the significance of foreign societies, cultures, and systems of government
*the international movement of people as immigrants, refugees, workers, students, tourists and investors
*the role of international organizations
*the globalization of the world economy
*foreign languages
*history

==Different countries' approaches==

===Australia===

	As discussed, the study of the International Studies discipline in Australia occurs mostly within universities and generally approaches the subject as a holistic study of international affairs and phenomena.
	The study is also offered in some Australian high schools. The VCE system, operating within Victoria, offers International Studies as an elective to year 12 students.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority. (2010). International Studies. Viewed 22/9/2010 &lt;http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/vce/studies/intstudies/internationalindex.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The two units offered in International Studies VCE are ‘Global issues and conflicts’ and ‘International Relations’.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

===Canada===

There are several International Studies programs in Canada that offer both undergraduate and graduate degrees. The [http://www.glendon.yorku.ca/internationalstudies/ Glendon College International Studies Program], the [https://www.sfu.ca/internationalstudies School for International Studies at Simon Fraser University], the [http://www.munkschool.utoronto.ca Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto], the [http://www.balsillieschool.ca Balsillie School of International Affairs], the [http://www.huronuc.on.ca/academics/faculty_arts_ss/departments/global_studies/ Centre for Global Studies at Huron University College], [http://www.cerium.ca/ Centre d'études et de Recherches Internationales de l'Université de Montréal], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120621101948/http://www.arts.uregina.ca/international-studies International Studies degree at the University of Regina], the [http://www.unbc.ca/internationalstudies International Studies MA Program at the University of Northern British Columbia] and the [http://www.hei.ulaval.ca/ Institut québécois des hautes études internationales] are the leading programs.

===Chile===
In Chile there is two undergraduated program. The oldest, International Studies undergraduate program which is offered by the [[Universidad de Santiago de Chile]]. This programme emphasises four core areas: International Relations, Methodology, International Trade, and Defense and Security. This programme has also been recognized through the participation of their students in different simulations of the United Nations System, like the National Model of United Nations NMUN in New York and Kobe 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usach.cl/news/brillante-desempeno-nuestros-estudiantes-debates-modelo-la-onu|title=Brillante desempeño de nuestros estudiantes en “Debates Modelo” de la ONU|website=Universidad de Santiago de Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and in the Modelo Naciones Unidas para Latinoamerica y el Caribe(MONULAC) in Antigua&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fae.usach.cl/fae/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4951:estudiantes-de-la-fae-son-reconocidos-en-conferencia-latinoamericana-de-modelo-de-naciones-unidas&amp;catid=13:noticias-fae|title=Estudiantes de la FAE son reconocidos en conferencia latinoamericana de Modelo de Naciones Unidas|first=Valentina del|last=Campo|website=fae.usach.cl}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The university opened this undergraduate programme in 2008 and it represents a very promising development in the study of the Social Sciences in Latin America. The [[Instituto de Estudios Avanzados]](IDEA) of the same university also offers a Masters in International Studies.
In 2018, the [[Universidad de Chile]] open a same programm in cooperation between different academic units like Facso and &lt;ref&gt;Instituto de Estudios Internacionales&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

In the UK the [[British International Studies Association|British International Studies Association (BISA)]] develops and promotes the study of International Studies, Global Politics and related subjects through teaching, research and the facilitation of contact between scholars.  International Studies is often related to or attached to the study in International Relations. At the [[University of Oxford]], the Centre for International Studies "exists to promote and advance research in International Relations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cis.politics.ox.ac.uk/about/index.asp About Us], University of Oxford: Centre for International Studies, Retrieved December 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense the use of the term ''International Studies'' differs to that of the Australian use of the term in that it is tied to the discipline of [[International Relations]], rather than addressing them as separate entities.
The [[Institute of Development Studies]] (IDS)] based in Sussex, is a leading global charity for international development research, teaching, and communications.

===United States===

There exist a number of institutions which promote International Studies in the United States of America. The Centre for Strategic &amp; International Studies is a foreign policy think tank which aims to ‘provide strategic insights and policy solutions to decisionmakers in government, international institutions, the private sector, and civil society’.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies. (2010). About Us. Viewed 22/9/2010 &lt;http://csis.org/about-us&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies is a research center based at Stanford University which is a ‘primary center for innovative research on major international issues and challenges’.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University. (2010). Introduction. Viewed 22/9/2010 &lt;http://fsi.stanford.edu/docs/about_fsi&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Both institutions focus primarily on the study of international affairs and relations in relation to US foreign policy, and therefore differ in the Australian approach to International Studies.  Alternatively, the undergraduate International Studies program at St. John Fisher College in Rochester, NY is a holistic program that more closely follows the Australian model. &lt;http://www.sjfc.edu/academics/arts-science/departments/international&gt;

===Career prospects===
As stated, many institutions attempt to promote their International Studies degrees by promoting the career prospects for graduates.  The University of Melbourne has stated that graduates of its International Studies major will be ‘attractive to prospective employees in the public and private sectors including international inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations’.&lt;ref&gt;The university of Melbourne, Faculty of Arts. (2007). International Studies. Viewed 21/9/2010&lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unimelb.edu.au/HB/areas/AISTUDY.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305143548/http://www.unimelb.edu.au/HB/areas/AISTUDY.html |archivedate=2011-03-05 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, RMIT University has stated that ‘the degree prepares you to apply your knowledge of globalization, language and culture in international workplace settings’,&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;RMIT University: Future Students. (2010). International Studies – Bachelor of Arts. Viewed 21/9/2010 &lt;http://www.rmit.edu.au/programs/bp048&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; such as ‘business, government and non-government organizations in a range of areas’.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

The discipline is also working under a premise that employment opportunities in the field of International Studies will steadily increase with the increasing level of interconnectedness which is occurring as a result of globalisation; ‘Opportunities for positions requiring international knowledge and skills are increasing and have created a need for graduates who are highly skilled, interculturally attuned and able to think and act globally/locally, as well as being bilingual’.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

The '''Lempel-Ziv complexity''' was first presented in the article ''On the Complexity of Finite Sequences'' (IEEE Trans. On IT-22,1 1976), by two Israeli computer scientists, [[Abraham Lempel]] and [[Jacob Ziv]]. This complexity measure is related to [[Kolmogorov complexity]], but the only function it uses is the recursive copy (i.e., the shallow copy).

The underlying mechanism in this complexity measure is the starting point for some algorithms for [[lossless data compression]], like [[LZ77 and LZ78|LZ77, LZ78]] and [[Lempel–Ziv–Welch|LZW]]. Even though it is based on an elementary principle of words copying, this complexity measure is not too restrictive in the sense that it satisfies the main qualities expected by such a measure: sequences with a certain regularity do not have a too large complexity, and the complexity grows as the sequence grows in length and irregularity.

The Lempel-Ziv complexity can be used to measure the repetitiveness of binary sequences and text, like song lyrics or prose.

== Principle ==
Let S be a binary sequence, of length n, for which we have to compute the Lempel-Ziv complexity, denoted C(S). The sequence is read from the left.

Imagine you have a delimiting line, which can be moved in the sequence during the calculation. At first, this line is set just after the first symbol, at the beginning of the sequence. This initial position is called position 1, from where we have to move it to a position 2, which is considered the initial position for the next step (and so on). We have to move the delimiter (starting in position 1) the further possible to the right, so that the sub-word between position 1 and the delimiter position be a word of the sequence that starts before the position 1 of the delimiter.

As soon as the delimiter is set on a position where this condition is not met, we stop, move the delimiter to this position, and start again by marking this position as a new initial position (i.e., position 1). Keep iterating until the end of the sequence. The Lempel-Ziv complexity corresponds to the number of iterations needed to finish this procedure.

Said differently, the Lempel-Ziv complexity is the number of different sub-strings (or sub-words) encountered as the binary sequence is viewed as a stream (from left to right).

== Formal explanations ==
The method proposed by Lempel and Ziv uses three notions: reproducibility, producibility and exhaustive history of a sequence, that we defined here.

=== Notations ===
Let S be a binary sequence of length n (i.e., n symbols taking value 0 or 1). Let S(i,j), with &lt;math&gt;1\leq i,j\leq n&lt;/math&gt;, be the sub-word of S from index i to index j (if j&lt;i, S(i,j) is the empty string). The length n of S is denoted l(S), and a sequence Q is said to be a fixed prefix of S if:

&lt;math&gt;\exists j&lt;{\text{l(S), s.t. S(1,j) = Q .}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Reproducibility and producibility ===
&lt;imagemap&gt;Image:Reproductibilité1.svg|200px|thumb|Example of reproducibility [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Reproductibilit%C3%A91.svg Click here] &lt;/imagemap&gt;

On the one hand, a sequence S of length n is said to be reproducible from its prefix S(1,j) when S(j+1,n) is a sub-word of S(1,n-1). This is denoted S(1,j)→S.

Said differently, S is reproducible from its prefix S(1,j) if the rest of the sequence, S(j+1,n), is nothing but a copy of another sub-word (starting at an index i &lt; j+1) of S(1,n-1).

To prove that the sequence S can be reproduced by one of its prefix S(1,j), you have to show that:

&lt;math&gt;\exists p\leq j, {\text{ s.t.  }}S(j+1,n)=S(p,l(S(j+1,n))+p-1)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;imagemap&gt;Image:Productibilité.svg|200px|thumb|Example of Productibility [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Productibilit%C3%A9.svg Click here] &lt;/imagemap&gt;

On the other hand, the producibility, is defined from the reproducibility : a sequence S is producible from its prefix S(1,j) if S(1,n-1) is reproducible from S(1,j). This is denoted S(1,j)⇒S. Said differently, S(j+1,n-1) has to be a copy of another sub-word of S(1,n-2). The last symbol of S can be a new symbol (but could not be), possibly leading to the production of a new sub-word (hence the term producibility).

&lt;imagemap&gt;Image:Prod_reprod1.svg|200px|thumb|Comparison between reproducibility and producibility [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Prod_reprod1.svg Click here] &lt;/imagemap&gt;

=== Exhaustive history and complexity ===
From the definition of productibility, the empty string Λ=S(1,0) ⇒ S(1,1). So by a recursive production process, at step i we have S(1,hi) ⇒ S(1,hi+1), so we can build S from its prefixes. And as S(1,i) ⇒ S(1,i+1) (with hi+1 =hi + 1) is always true, this production process of S takes at most n=l(S) steps. Let m, &lt;math&gt;1\leq {\text{m}}\leq l(S)&lt;/math&gt;, be the number of steps necessary for this product process of S. S can be written in a decomposed form, called history of S, and denoted H(S), defined like this:

&lt;math&gt;H(S)=S(1,h_{1})S(h_{1}+1,h_{2})\dotsm S(h_{{m-1}}+1,h_{m})&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;H_{i}(S)=S(h_{{i-1}}+1,h_{i}),i=1,2\dotsm m,
{\text{where}  }\; h_{0}=0,h_{1}=1,h_{m}=l(S),{\text{ is called component of } H(S)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;imagemap&gt;Image:Hist_exh&amp;complexite1.svg|200px|thumb|Comparison between reproductibility and productibility [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Hist_exh%26complexite1.svg Click here] &lt;/imagemap&gt;

A component of S, Hi(S), is said to be exhaustive if S(1,hi) is the longest sequence produced by S(1,hi-1) (i.e., S(1,hi-1) ⇒ S(1,hi)) but so that S(1,hi-1) does not produce S(1,hi) (denoted ).&lt;math&gt;S(1,h_{i}-1)\nrightarrow S(1,h_{i})&lt;/math&gt; The index p which allows to have the longest production is called pointer.

The history of S is said to be exhaustive if all its component are exhaustive, except possibly the last one. From the definition, one can show that any sequence S has only one exhaustive history, and this history is the one with the smallest number of component from all the possible histories of S. Finally, the number of component of this unique exhaustive history of S is called the Lempel-Ziv complexity of S.

== Algorithm ==
Hopefully, there exists a very efficient method for computing this complexity, in a linear number of operation (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(n)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n=l(S)&lt;/math&gt; length of the sequence S).

A formal description of this method is given by the following [[algorithm]]:
* i = p - 1, p is the pointer (see above)
* u is the length of the current prefix
* v is the length of the current component for the current pointer p
* vmax is the final length used for the current component (largest on all the possible pointers p)
* and C is the Lempel-Ziv Complexity, incremented iteratively.

&lt;syntaxhighlight line lang="pascal"&gt;
// S is a binary sequence of size n
i := 0
C := 1
u := 1
v := 1
vmax := v
while u + v &lt;= n do
   if S[i + v] = S[u + v] then
      v := v + 1
   else
      vmax := max(v, vmax)
      i := i + 1
      if i = u then  // all the pointers have been treated
         C := C + 1
         u := u + vmax
         v := 1
         i := 0
         vmax := v
      else
         v := 1
      end if
   end if
end while
if v != 1 then
    C := C+1
end si
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The U.S. state of [[Utah]] has 26 [[Lists of United States state insignia|official symbols]], as designated by the [[Utah State Legislature]], and three unofficial symbols.  All official symbols, except the Great Seal, are listed in Title 63G of Utah Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.le.utah.gov/UtahCode/section.jsp?code=63G-1 | title=State Symbols and Designations| work=Utah Code | publisher=Utah State Legislature | accessdate=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1896, Utah became a state, and on April 3 the Utah legislature, in its first regular session, adopted its first symbol, the [[Seals of the U.S. states|Great Seal]] of the State of Utah.&lt;ref name="flag and seal" /&gt;

Many unique symbols of Utah are related to Utah's [[Mormon pioneers|pioneer]] heritage, such as the [[California gull]], the [[Beehive (beekeeping)|beehive]], the [[dutch oven]] and the [[Calochortus nuttallii|Sego Lily]].  Utah has symbols that are used by multiple states.  For example, the [[Western honey bee|honey bee]], Utah's state insect, is also a symbol of [[Arkansas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Maine]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Jersey]], [[North Carolina]], [[West Virginia]] and [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gpnc.org/honeybee.htm | title=honeybee | publisher=Great Plains Nature Center | accessdate=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="82623">The following table shows the [[aspect ratio]] (height to width ratio) of [[national flag]]s used by countries and dependencies. Variant flags such as [[ensign]]s are listed in the "Alternative flags" column, if they have different proportions from the national flag. Territories without an official flag distinct from that of their controlling country are excluded.

The ratios used most commonly are 2:3, used by 89 of 195 sovereign states, and 1:2, used by 54 sovereign states. Most dependencies and former colonies use the same proportions as their mother countries: all [[British Overseas Territories]] use 1:2 ratios, while the flags of most former and current Dutch and French areas have 2:3 proportions.

For comparison, the ratios are also given as a decimal number, which is the flag width divided by its height (e.g. a 2:3 flag has a decimal ratio of {{sfrac|3|2}} = 1.5). Flags with [[Irrational number|irrational]] ratios have only a decimal approximation, and have the exact form given in the "Notes" column.

Legend:

* '''Bold''': [[List of sovereign states|Sovereign states]] (UN members and observers)
* '''''Bold italics''''': [[List of states with limited recognition|States with limited recognition]]
* ''Italics'': [[Dependent territory|Dependencies]], [[Constituent state|constituent countries]], and other non-sovereign territories

Click on the "Flag" header to sort by status: first sovereign states, then ''de facto'' countries, then dependencies.&lt;!-- This doesn't work correctly. Can someone fix? --&gt;

==Territories not included==
* None of the thirteen [[Overseas France|overseas regions and territories of France]] except [[French Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]] and the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]] have official flags other than the French tricolor. [[Flag of French Guiana|A flag]] for the department of [[French Guiana]] has been officially adopted, though this flag has not been approved by the regional council. Most of the other territories however have unofficial flags, and some of these flags are used locally. See [[Flags of the regions of France]].
* [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], Sovereign Base Areas of the United Kingdom, don't have an official [[Flag of Akrotiri and Dhekelia|flag]] other than the Union Jack. A reported green flag defaced with two golden lions is actually the flag of the Dhekelia Garrison, and is not an official flag of the entire territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{FOTW|id=cy%5Esba|anchor=dhe|title=Akrotiri and Dhekelia|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[British Overseas Territory]] of [[Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha]] has no separate flag and uses the Union Jack. The three constituent parts have their own flags, which all follow the "blue ensign with territorial arms" pattern of most other BOTs. See [[Flag of Saint Helena]], [[Flag of Ascension Island]] and [[Flag of Tristan da Cunha]].
* The nine [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]] don't have official flags, though there are unofficial local flags for five of the islands and island groups ([[Johnston Atoll]], the [[Midway Islands]], [[Palmyra Atoll]], [[Wake Island]] and [[Navassa Island]]).
* None of the [[Dependencies of Norway|Norwegian overseas territories]] have flags.
* [[Antarctica]] has no government and as such can't officially adopt a flag, though there are two proposed flags widely used to represent the continent: a blue flag by [[Graham Bartram]] and an orange flag by [[Whitney Smith]]. See [[Flags of Antarctica]].

==Notes==
{{Reflist|group=Note|refs=
&lt;ref name="Nepal"&gt;The exact width:height ratio of the flag of Nepal is: &lt;div&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{24+\frac{297-180\sqrt{2}}{92-36\sqrt{2}}\cdot\left(1+\frac{8-3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{118-48\sqrt{2}}-6}\right)}{32+\frac{297-180\sqrt{2}}{92-36\sqrt{2}}\cdot\left(1+\frac{6}{\left(8-3\sqrt{2}\right)\cdot\left(\sqrt{1+\frac{18}{41-24\sqrt{2}}}-1\right)}\right)} = \frac{3 \left(40665857401448+2001055256793 \sqrt{2}+144 \sqrt{17 \left(10411242561157458401-2208656823577139226 \sqrt{2}\right)}\right)}{164926945077845} \approx 0.82033758776860084636 \ldots&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an alphabetical '''list of psychotherapies'''.

See the main article [[psychotherapy]] for a description of what psychotherapy is and how it developed (see also [[counseling]], and the [[list of counseling topics]]).

This list contains some approaches that may not call themselves a psychotherapy but have a similar aim, of improving mental health and well being through talk and other means of communication.

In the 20th century, a great number of psychotherapies were created.  All of these face continuous change in popularity, methods and effectiveness. Sometimes they are self-administered, either individually, in pairs, small groups or larger groups.  However, a professional practitioner will usually use a combination of therapies and approaches, often in a team treatment process that involves reading/talking/reporting to other professional practitioners.

The older established therapies usually have a code of ethics, professional associations, training programs, and so on. The newer and innovative therapies may not yet have established these structures or may not wish to.

'''MRK''' (Markos Kay) is a visual artist, creative director, illustrator and lecturer based in London, best known for his artificial life video art experiment "aDiatomea" (2007), a permanent exhibit at the [[Phyletic Museum]] in [[Jena]], Germany. His 3D generative short "The Flow" (2011) has been shown internationally as part of "Resonance" a collaboration of over 30 independent visual artists and sound designers. MRK's films have been exhibited worldwide, including OFFF Barcelona, [[Pause Fest]] Melbourne, [[Onedotzero]] London, Stroke Artfair Berlin and Viedram Rome.

== Biography ==

MRK graduated with a [[Master of Arts]] in [[Communication Design]] from [[Central St. Martins]] in 2007 and is currently working as a creative director, [[motion graphics|motion designer]] and lecturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jotta.com/jotta/published/home/article/v2-published/1942/spotlight-markos-kay-and-the-generative-flow |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826160925/http://www.jotta.com/jotta/published/home/article/v2-published/1942/spotlight-markos-kay-and-the-generative-flow |archivedate=26 August 2014 |df= }} "Jotta:Markos Kay"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, MRK released “aDiatomea,” an experimental piece that simulates [[diatoms]] consisting of realistic [[3d modeling|3d generated]] diatoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://algorithmic-worlds.net/blfiog/blog.php?Post=20100123]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "Algorithmic Worlds"&lt;/ref&gt; Each variant of these mathematical creatures is classified in actual [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomies]], giving Victorian diatom art a 21st-century redux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://okological.tumblr.com/post/5574305704/adiatomea-by-mrk-adiatomea-are-a-series-of |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031126/http://okological.tumblr.com/post/5574305704/adiatomea-by-mrk-adiatomea-are-a-series-of |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }} "Okological: aDiatomea"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Granular synthesis|Granular sound]] is 'injected' into the diatoms affecting their form and movement, creating a [[dynamic system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dataisnature.com/?p=564] "Dataisnature"&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, "aDiatomea" was part of the official selection at Imagine Science Films in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imaginesciencefilms.org/2012/10/10/the-flow/] "Imagine Science Films"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1514">'''Off-flavours''' or '''off-flavors''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]]) are taints in food products caused by the presence of undesirable compounds.  They can originate in raw materials, from chemical changes during food processing and storage, and from micro-organisms. Off-flavours are a recurring issue in [[drinking water]] supply and many [[food]] products.

Water bodies are often affected by [[geosmin]] and [[2-methylisoborneol]], affecting the flavour of water for drinking and of fish growing in that water.&lt;ref&gt;Robin, J. et al. (2006).  Off flavour characterization and origin in French trout farming.

'''''On Intelligence: How a New Understanding of the Brain will Lead to the Creation of Truly Intelligent Machines''''' is a 2004 book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawkins|first1=Jeff|title=On Intelligence|date=2004|publisher=Times Books|isbn=0805074562|pages=272|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Palm (PDA)|Palm Pilot]]-inventor [[Jeff Hawkins]] with ''[[New York Times]]'' science writer [[Sandra Blakeslee]]. The book explains Hawkins' [[memory-prediction framework]] theory of the [[brain]] and describes some of its consequences.

==Outline==
Hawkins outlines the book as follows:

{{Quote|The book starts with some background on why previous attempts at understanding intelligence and building intelligent machines have failed. I then introduce and develop the core idea of the theory, what I call the memory-prediction framework. In chapter 6 I detail how the physical brain implements the memory-prediction model—in other words, how the brain actually works. I then discuss social and other implications of the theory, which for many readers might be the most thought-provoking section. The book ends with a discussion of intelligent machines—how we can build them and what the future will be like. (p. 5)}}

==A personal history==
The first chapter is a brief history of Hawkins' interest in neuroscience juxtaposed against a history of artificial intelligence research. Hawkins uses a story of his failed application to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to illustrate a conflict of ideas. Hawkins believed (and ostensibly continues to believe) creating true artificial intelligence will only be possible with intellectual progress in the discipline of neuroscience. Hawkins writes that the scientific establishment (as symbolized by MIT) has historically rejected the relevance of neuroscience to artificial intelligence. Indeed, some artificial intelligence researchers have "[taken] pride in ignoring neurobiology" (p.&amp;nbsp;12).

Hawkins is an [[electrical engineer]] by training, and a neuroscientist by inclination. He used electrical engineering concepts as well as the studies of neuroscience to formulate his framework. In particular, Hawkins treats the propagation of nerve impulses in our [[nervous system]] as an [[code|encoding problem]], specifically, a future predicting [[state machine]], similar in principle to [[feed forward (control)|feed-forward]] [[error-correcting]] state machines.

==The theory==
{{main|Memory-prediction framework}}
Hawkins' basic idea is that the brain is a mechanism to predict the future, specifically, hierarchical regions of the brain predict their future input sequences. Perhaps not always far in the future, but far enough to be of real use to an organism.  As such, the brain is a [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]] [[hierarchical state machine]] with special properties that enable it to [[learning|learn]].

The [[state machine]] actually controls the behavior of the organism.  Since it is a [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]] state machine, the machine responds to future events predicted from past data.

The hierarchy is capable of memorizing frequently observed sequences ([[Cognitive modules]]) of patterns and developing invariant representations.  Higher levels of the cortical hierarchy predict the future on a longer time scale, or over a wider range of sensory input. Lower levels interpret or control limited domains of experience, or sensory or effector systems. Connections from the higher level states predispose some selected transitions in the lower-level state machines.

[[Hebbian learning]] is part of the framework, in which the event of learning physically alters neurons and connections, as learning takes place.

[[Vernon Mountcastle]]'s formulation of a [[cortical column]] is a basic element in the framework.  Hawkins places particular emphasis on the role of the interconnections from peer columns, and the activation of columns as a whole.  He strongly implies that a column is the cortex's physical representation of a state in a state machine.

As an engineer, any specific failure to find a natural occurrence of some process in his framework does not signal a fault in the memory-prediction framework ''per se'', but merely signals that the natural process has performed Hawkins' functional decomposition  in a different, unexpected way, as Hawkins' motivation is to create intelligent [[machine]]s. For example, for the purposes of his framework, the nerve impulses can be taken to form a temporal sequence (but phase encoding could be a possible implementation of such a sequence; these details are immaterial for the framework).

==Predictions of the theory of the memory-prediction framework==
His [[prediction]]s use the [[visual system]] as a prototype for some example predictions, such as Predictions 2, 8, 10, and 11. Other predictions cite the [[auditory system]]  ( Predictions 1, 3, 4, and 7).
*An Appendix of 11 Testable Predictions:

=== Enhanced neural activity in anticipation of a sensory event===
1. In all areas of [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], Hawkins (2004) predicts "we should find ''anticipatory cells''", cells that fire in anticipation of a sensory [[Phenomenon|event]].
:Note: As of 2005 [[mirror neuron]]s have been observed to fire ''before'' an anticipated event.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spatially specific prediction===
2. In primary sensory [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], Hawkins predicts, for example, "we should find anticipatory cells in or near [[Visual cortex#Primary visual cortex (V1)|V1]], at a precise location in the visual field (the scene)". It has been experimentally determined, for example, after mapping the angular position of some objects in the visual field, there will be a one-to-one correspondence of cells in the scene to the angular positions of those objects. Hawkins predicts that when the features of a visual scene are known in a memory, anticipatory cells should fire ''before'' the actual objects are seen in the scene.

=== Prediction should stop propagating in the cortical column at layers 2 and 3===
3. In layers 2 and 3, predictive activity (neural firing) should stop propagating at specific cells, corresponding to a specific prediction. Hawkins does not rule out anticipatory cells in layers 4 and 5.

=== "Name cells" at layers 2 and 3 should preferentially connect to layer 6 cells of cortex===
4. Learned sequences of firings comprise a representation of ''temporally constant invariants''. Hawkins calls the cells which fire in this sequence "name cells". Hawkins suggests that these ''name cells'' are in layer 2, physically adjacent to layer 1. Hawkins does not rule out the existence of layer 3 cells with dendrites in layer 1, which might perform as ''name cells''.

=== "Name cells" should remain ON during a learned sequence===
5. By definition, a ''temporally constant invariant'' will be active during a learned sequence. Hawkins posits that these cells will remain active for the duration of the learned sequence, even if the remainder of the cortical column is shifting state. Since we do not know the encoding of the sequence, we do not yet know the definition of ''ON'' or ''active''; Hawkins suggests that the ON pattern may be as simple as a simultaneous [[logical and|AND]] (i.e., the name cells simultaneously "light up") across an array of name cells.
:See [[Neural ensemble#Encoding]] for ''grandmother neurons'' which perform this type of function.

=== "Exception cells" should remain OFF during a learned sequence ===
6. Hawkins' novel prediction is that certain cells are inhibited during a learned sequence. A class of cells in layers 2 and 3 should NOT fire during a learned sequence, the axons of these "exception cells" should fire ''only if a local prediction is failing''. This prevents flooding the brain with the usual sensations, leaving only exceptions for post-processing.

=== "Exception cells" should propagate unanticipated events===
7. If an unusual event occurs (the learned sequence fails), the "exception cells" should fire, propagating up the cortical hierarchy to the [[hippocampus]], the repository of new memories.

=== "Aha! cells" should trigger predictive activity ===
8. Hawkins predicts a cascade of predictions, when recognition occurs, propagating down the cortical column (with each [[saccade]] of the [[human eye|eye]] over a learned scene, for example).

=== Pyramidal cells should detect coincidences of synaptic activity on thin dendrites===
9. [[Pyramidal cell]]s should be capable of detecting coincident events on thin [[dendrite]]s, even for a [[neuron]] with thousands of [[synapse]]s. Hawkins posits a temporal window (presuming time-encoded firing) which is necessary for his [[theory]] to remain viable.

=== Learned representations move down the cortical hierarchy, with training ===
10. Hawkins posits, for example, that if the inferotemporal (IT) layer has learned a sequence, that eventually cells in V4 will also learn the sequence.

==="Name cells" exist in all regions of cortex===
11. Hawkins predicts that "name cells" will be found in all regions of the cortex.

[[File:Orbites definition.png|thumb|250px|right|Six schemes of circumstellar orbit]]

'''Outer-grazer''' and '''inner-grazer''' are configurations of [[heliocentric orbit]]. All six diagrams show the [[Sun]] (the orange dot) in the middle and a putative [[planet]]'s [[orbit]]al band (in yellow). The latter is a ring whose inner radius is the planet's [[perihelion]] and its outer radius the [[aphelion]].

* ''Middle, top'': The minor planet's orbit enters the other planet's orbit from the inside without traversing it; it is an inner-grazer.
* ''Middle, bottom'': The minor planet's orbit enters the planet's from outside without traversing it; it is an outer-grazer.

'''Peter Ascanius''' (24 May 1723 – 4 June 1803) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[biologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.nhm.uio.no/forskning/aktuelt/arrangementer/konferanser-seminarer/2011/bergseminaret-berg-o.pdf|title=  Peder Ascanius (1723-1803)    
|publisher =   Naturhistorisk Museum, UiO |author=  |accessdate= January 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born at [[Aure, Norway|Aure]] in Møre og Romsdal, Norway. He was a student of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]. He taught [[zoology]] and [[mineralogy]] in [[Copenhagen]] from 1759 to 1771, and later worked as a supervisor at the mines in [[Kongsberg]] and elsewhere in Norway. Among his published works was the five-volume illustrated ''Icones rerum naturalium''. He was a [[Royal Society|Fellow of the Royal Society]], elected in 1755 as a Foreign Member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27NA7938%27%29|title=Fellow details|accessdate=14 October 2012|publisher=royalsociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/Peter_Ascanius|title=  Peder Ascanius |publisher =    Store norske leksikon

'''PressureNET''' is a crowd-sourced reporting network for [[barometric pressure]] data.

It works by having many users install it on cell phones that contain air pressure sensors (barometers) and GPS sensors. Once the location is known from the GPS data, it is able to send messages back to the server with the air pressure for that location on earth. With enough users running the application it is possible to create useful, global pressure data.  It uses [[open source software]] running on [[Android phone]]s, to collect data from locations around the world.  The data is available on a public website.&lt;ref name="Gohring-2013"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/510626/app-feeds-scientists-atmospheric-data-from-thousands-of-smartphones/ | title = App Feeds Scientists Atmospheric Data from Thousands of Smartphones | work = [[MIT Technology Review]] | publisher =  | date = 1 February 2013 | first = Nancy  | last = Gohring | accessdate = 1 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | last = Kar | first = Saroj | title = PressureNET: Android Open CrowdSourced Weather Network | url = http://siliconangle.com/blog/2012/12/03/pressurenet-android-open-crowdsourced-weather-network/ | accessdate = 21 January 2013 | newspaper = SiliconANGLE | date = 3 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | last = Gohring | first = Nancy | title = Android app could help scientists predict the weather | url = https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-01/08/android-weather-app | accessdate = 21 January 2013 | newspaper = Wired.co.uk | date = 8 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | last = Beeler | first = Carolyn | title = Sandy silver lining: Storm helped app developers inch closer to 'nowcasting' weather | url = http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/item/49316 | accessdate = 21 January 2013 | newspaper = NewsWorks | date = 8 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hartmut Rosa]], professor of [[sociology]] at the University of Jena, uses the term '''resonance''' to explain social phenomena from a fundamental human quest for "resonant" relationships. His ''resonance theory'' became fundamental in ''Resonanz'', published in 2016. ''A sociology of the world relationship'' formulated.&lt;ref name="Cite book|isbn=3-518-58626-2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Resonanz.

== Resonance term ==
The term resonance is taken from physics to describe a [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]-[[Object (philosophy)|object]] relationship as a vibrating system in which both sides mutually stimulate each other. In contrast to the physical meaning of the word, however, here they do not merely return the received sound, but speak "with their own voice". The subjects' relational abilities and their intersubjective structures are constituted by such resonance experiences or their absence. This is made clear by the primary relationship of the newborn to its reference person, by whose reception or rejection of interactions the fundamental relationship patterns develop. With the concept of resonance used in this way, an attempt is made to find a way of approaching the question of successful relations between subject and world in the sense of "good life" as free as possible from cultural evaluations and assumptions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.blaetter.de/archiv/jahrgaenge/2016/mai/resonanz-oder-das-ende-der-kritischen-theorie|title=Resonanz oder: Das Ende der kritischen Theorie|last=Brumlik|first=Micha|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=120–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possible points of reference of such resonances are ubiquitous and are described in three basic axes: Horizontal resonances take place between two (or more) people, in love and family relationships, friendships or political space. Diagonal resonance axes are relationships to things and activities, vertical resonance axes are relationships to the great collective singulars: nature, art, history or religion. In all these contexts, intensive experiences are possible that make life experienceable as an intensive encounter or relationship for its own sake. This is juxtaposed with silent or instrumental world relations, determined by the orientation towards domination and making available, which are primarily concerned with the achievement of a useful goal.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; For example, a mountain tour can be a resonance experience as an intensive confrontation with the demands of the path and the encountering nature, as a purely purpose-oriented company but also instrumental and in this sense "mute".

Obviously, world sections that are perceived as attractive or desirable are predestined for resonance experiences, while those that are perceived as hostile or anxious are expected to be "silent", non-resonant experiences. Another prerequisite for the establishment of resonances are strong evaluations of the subject, which give the object a significance that goes beyond desire or attractiveness.

If an attempt is made to outline as resonance what people seek and long for in their innermost being, it is by no means conceived as a permanent state that can be established, but always as a selective, momentary success or self-adjustment that stands out against the background of the predominantly silent, instrumental. Resonance in this sense is therefore essentially characterized by the fact that it cannot be produced systematically and intentionally, but is ultimately unavailable.

== Social theory ==
As a sociological theory, resonance theory deals with the social conditions that promote or hinder successful relationships. If the striving for resonance is regarded as ubiquitous human primary motivation, its concretization depends to a large extent on historical, geographical and cultural conditions. In particular, existential hardship and political repression complicate resonance experiences if they do not make them completely impossible. The promise of modernity is therefore to make resonance possible by overcoming political arbitrariness and improving material resources. Rosa sees this promise as an inherent contradiction of modernity, however, undermined by the conditions that progress, which is primarily geared to increasing resources, ultimately requires: Expanded resources expand the world accessible to the subject and thus his possibilities for resonance experiences. This results in a logic of increase, which requires a constant continuation of improvement and multiplication of resources. This is accompanied by an increasing pressure to accelerate: in order to maintain the status quo within a modern society, an increasingly rapid increase in services, innovations and material production is necessary. Rosa sees this mode of dynamic stabilization as constitutive for modernity: while pre-modern societies transform themselves adaptively, i.e. in response to changed conditions, modern society is virtually defined by its compulsion for continuous transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beschleunigung: die Veränderung der Zeitstrukturen in der Moderne|last=Rosa|first=Hartmut|publisher=Suhrkamp|year=2015|isbn=3-518-29360-5|location=Frankfurt am Main|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the current phase of late modernism is characterized by a high resonance sensitivity and expectation of its subjects, the mode of dynamic stabilization results in a loss of resonance possibilities. Rosa notes three essential manifestations of the current crisis of modernity:

* the [[ecological crisis]] due to the finite nature of natural resources compared to an unlimited expectation of increase
* the political crisis, which arises essentially from the fact that democratic negotiation processes are too slow for the accelerated technological and resulting social changes and are therefore regarded as ineffective or obsolete, and
* the psychological crisis of the subjects, which is overwhelmed by the acceleration and therefore see itself exhausted (burn-out).

Resonance theory is thus in the tradition of [[critical theory]] from [[Marx]] to [[Adorno]] and [[Horkheimer]] to [[Habermas]] and [[Honneth]]. It shares the central finding of [[Social alienation|alienation]] as an obstacle to a successful life, but attempts to contrast this description ex negativo with a positive counter-concept, the concept of resonance. Honneth, for example, has already made this attempt with the concept of recognition. Despite all the conceded vagueness and diversity of the concept of resonance, Rosa sees this as a universal concept that includes concepts such as recognition, justice or self-efficacy.

== Reception ==
Rosa's work and the resonance theory formulated in it are controversially received and discussed. On the one hand, the author is attested originality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/buecher/hartmut-rosas-soziologie-der-schwingungen-wenn-die-welt-zum-resonanzraum-wird-ld.87627|title=Wenn die Welt zum Resonanzraum wird|last=König|first=Helmut|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|issn=0376-6829}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the courage to analyse the fundamental issues and, in contrast to the Critical Theory often summarised with [[Adorno]]'s "There is no right life in the wrong",&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; the optimistic perspective is emphasised which is oriented towards potentials for overcoming the stated crisis. Such an appreciation of resonance theory as a positive continuation of critical theory can be found with Anna Henkel.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; [[Micha Brumlik|&lt;br /&gt;Micha Brumlik]] sees in the comprehensive combination of interdisciplinary strands the completion, but with it also the end, of Critical Theory, which thereby loses its "theoretically informed irreconcilability looking coldly at society".

On the other hand, it is precisely this comprehensive derivation of the concept of resonance from a multitude of perspectives and contexts that is criticized to the effect that "resonance" has an almost arbitrary effect, that the concept lacks precision,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; and that it is therefore ultimately unsuitable as a social-philosophical basic concept, as Rosa postulates it to be.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Another point of criticism refers to Rosa's alleged recourse to the intellectual world of Romanticism, to which he wanted to return without pointing the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.zeit.de/2016/26/hartmut-rosa-resonanz-sachbuch|title=Hartmut Rosa: Soziologie mit der Stimmgabel|last=Thomä|first=Dieter|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|issn=0044-2070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosa does indeed frequently refer to the resonance sensitivity of Romanticism even in conscious contradiction to rationalist concepts, but at the same time sees the danger of purely subjective emotion instead of resonance in the way Romanticism thinks.&lt;ref name="Cite book|isbn=3-518-58626-2"/&gt; Thus he rather describes the continuing effect of the resonance concepts of Romanticism in modernity, without propagating a return to it.&lt;ref name="Cite book|isbn=3-518-58626-2"/&gt;

Finally, Rosa's book argues that the socio-political outlook on concrete solutions is poor and that he ultimately fails to explain how resonance can be socially established as a response to the accelerating crisis of modernity. Despite the reference to political reform proposals such as that of an unconditional basic income and emerging pilot projects of a post-growth economy, Rosa himself rejects this claim, however, because he shares "the question of how one could get from the social formations of 'the Middle Ages' into modernity: In both cases it is a fundamental transformation of the world relationship..."&lt;ref name="Cite book|isbn=3-518-58626-2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11498">A '''scatterometer''' or '''diffusionmeter''' is a scientific instrument to measure the return of a beam of light or radar waves [[Scattering|scattered]] by diffusion in a medium such as air. Diffusionmeters using visible light are found in airports or along roads to measure horizontal [[visibility]]. Radar scatterometers use radio or microwaves to determine the normalized [[Radar cross-section|radar cross section]] (σ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, "sigma zero" or "sigma naught") of a surface. They are often mounted on [[weather satellite]]s to find wind speed and direction, and are used in industries to analyze the roughness of surfaces.

== Optical ==
[[File:Dohlednostmereni.jpg|thumb|left|Airport scatterometer (or diffusometer).]]
Optical diffusionmeters are devices used in [[meteorology]] to find the optical range or the horizontal visibility. They consist of a light source, usually a [[laser]], and a receiver. Both are placed at a 35° angle downward, aimed at a common area. Lateral [[scattering]] by the air along the light beam is quantified as an [[attenuation coefficient]]. Any departure from the clear air extinction coefficient (e.g. in fog) is measured and is inversely proportional to the visibility (the greater the loss, the lower is the visibility).

These devices are found in [[automatic weather station]]s for general visibility, along airport runways for [[runway visual range]], or along roads for visual conditions. Their main drawback is that the measurement is done over the very small volume of air between the transmitter and the receiver. The visibility reported is therefore only representative of the general conditions around the instrument in generalized conditions ([[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic]] fog for instance). This is not always the case (e.g. patchy fog).

== Radar scatterometer ==
[[File:Scattometer principle.GIF|thumb|Radar scatterometer]]
A '''radar scatterometer''' operates by transmitting a pulse of [[microwave]] energy towards the [[Earth]]'s surface and measuring the reflected energy.  A separate measurement of the noise-only power is made and subtracted from the signal+noise measurement to determine the [[backscatter]] signal power.  [[radar cross section|Sigma-0]] (σ⁰) is computed from the signal power measurement using the distributed target radar equation.  Scatterometer instruments are very precisely calibrated in order to make accurate backscatter measurements.

The primary application of [[Kármán line|space]]borne scatterometry has been measurements of near-surface [[wind]]s over the [[ocean]].&lt;ref name='Naderi1991'&gt;{{cite journal |author1=F. Naderi |author2=M. H. Freilich |author3=D. G. Long |last-author-amp=yes |title=Spaceborne Radar Measurement of Wind Velocity Over the Ocean—An Overview of the NSCAT Scatterometer System |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |pages=850–866 |volume=79 |number=6 |date=June 1991 |doi=10.1109/5.90163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such instruments are known as wind scatterometers. By combining sigma-0 measurements from different [[azimuth]] angles, the near-surface wind [[Euclidean vector|vector]] over the ocean's surface can be determined using a [[Geophysics|geophysical]] model function (GMF) which relates wind and backscatter.  Over the ocean, the radar backscatter results from scattering from wind-generated capillary-gravity waves, which are generally in equilibrium with the near-surface wind over the ocean. The scattering mechanism is known as [[Bragg scattering]], which occurs from the waves that are in resonance with the microwaves.

The backscattered power depends on the wind speed and direction.  Viewed from different azimuth angles, the observed backscatter from these waves varies. These variations can be exploited to estimate the sea surface wind, i.e. its speed and direction. This estimate process is sometimes termed ''''wind retrieval'''' or ''''model function inversion''''. This is a non-linear inversion procedure based on an accurate knowledge of the GMF (in an [[empirical]] or semi-empirical form) that relates the scatterometer backscatter and the vector wind. Retrieval requires an angular diversity scatterometer measurements with the GMF, which is provided by the scatterometer making several backscatter measurements of the same spot on the ocean's surface from different azimuth angles.

Non-terrestrial applications include study of Solar System moons using space probes. This is especially the case with the NASA/ESA Cassini mission to Saturn and its moons.

Several generations of wind scatterometers have been flown in space by [[NASA]], [[European Space Agency|ESA]], and [[National Space Development Agency of Japan|NASDA]].  The first operational wind scatterometer was known as the [[SEASAT|Seasat]] Scatterometer (SASS) and was launched in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;W.L. Grantham, et al., The SeaSat-A Satellite Scatterometer, ''IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering'', Vol. OE-2, pp 200–206, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a fan-beam system operating at Ku-band (14&amp;nbsp;GHz).  In 1991 ESA launched the [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite]] ERS-1 Advanced Microwave Instrument (AMI) scatterometer,&lt;ref&gt;E. Attema, The Active Microwave Instrument Onboard the ERS-1 Satellite, ''Proceedings of the IEEE'', 79, 6, pp. 791–799, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the ERS-2 AMI scatterometer in 1995.  Both AMI fan-beam systems operated at C-band (5.6&amp;nbsp;GHz).  In 1996 NASA launched the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT),&lt;ref name='Naderi1991' /&gt; a Ku-band fan-beam system.&lt;ref&gt;W-Y Tsai, J.E. Graf, C. Winn, J.N. Huddleston, S. Dunbar, M.H. Freilich, F.J.

Postlaunch Sensor Verification and Calibration of the NASA Scatterometer, ''IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing'', Vol. 37, No. 3, pp. 1517–1542, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; NASA launched the first scanning scatterometer, known as ''''SeaWinds'''', on [[QuikSCAT]] in 1999.  It operated at Ku-band. A second SeaWinds instrument was flown on the NASDA ADEOS-2 in 2002.  The [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] launched a Ku-band scatterometer on their Oceansat-2 platform in 2009.  [[European Space Agency|ESA]] and [[European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites|EUMETSAT]] launched the first C-band ASCAT in 2006 onboard [[Metop]]-A.&lt;ref&gt;J. Figa-Saldaña, J.J.W. Wilson, E. Attema, R. Gelsthorpe, M.R. Drinkwater, and A. Stoffelen. The advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) on the meteorological operational (MetOp) platform: A follow on for European wind scatterometers, ''Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing'', Vol. 28, No. 3, June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System]] (CYGNSS), launched in 2016, is a constellation of eight small satellites utilizing a [[Bistatic radar|bistatic]] approach by analyzing the reflection from the Earth's surface of [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) signals, rather than using an onboard radar transmitter.

===Contribution to botany===
Scatterometers helped to prove the hypothesis, dating from mid-19th century, of the [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] (direction dependent) long distance dispersion by wind to explain the strong [[Floristics|floristic]] affinities between landmasses.

A work, published by the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in May 2004 with the title "Wind as a Long-Distance Dispersal Vehicle in the Southern Hemisphere", used daily measurements of wind azimuth and speed taken by the '''SeaWinds scatterometer''' from 1999 to 2003. They found a stronger correlation of floristic similarities with wind connectivity than with geographic proximities, which supports the idea that wind is a dispersal vehicle for many organisms in the Southern Hemisphere.

===Semiconductor and precision manufacturing===

Scatterometers are widely used in metrology for roughness of polished and lapped surfaces in semiconductor and precision machining industries.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Stover.

The '''shadow square''', also known as an '''altitude scale''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shadow Square |url=http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/museum/esim.asp?c=100314 |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an instrument used to determine the linear height of an object, in conjunction with the [[alidade]], for angular observations. It was invented by [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] in 9th-century [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= King|first= David A.|year= 2002 |title= A Vetustissimus Arabic Text on the Quadrans Vetus|journal= [[Journal for the History of Astronomy]]|volume= 33|pages= 237&amp;ndash;255|bibcode = 2002JHA....33..237K }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2010}}  Shadow squares are often found on the backs of [[astrolabe]]s.

==Uses==
The main use of a shadow square is to measure the linear height of an object using its shadow. It does so by simulating the ratio between an object, generally a gnomon, and its shadow.If the sun's ray is between 0 degrees and 45 degrees the umbra versa (Vertical axis) is used, between 45 degrees and 90 degrees the umbra recta (Horizontal axis) is used and when the sun's ray is at 45 degrees its shadow falls exactly on the umbra media (y=x) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shadow Square|url=http://catalogue.museogalileo.it/indepth/ShadowSquare.html|publisher=Museo Galilieo|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used during the time of medieval astronomy to determine the height of, and to track the movement of celestial bodies such as the sun when more advanced measurement methods were not available. These methods can still be used today to determine the altitude, with reference to the horizon, of any visible celestial body.

[[File:Gnomon--21juin.gif|thumbnail|A gnomon works as a tool to produce a shadow for measurement.]]

==Gnomon==
A [[gnomon]] is used along with a shadow box commonly. A gnomon is a stick placed vertically in a sunny place so that it casts a shadow that can be measured. By studying the shadow of the gnomon you can learn a lot of information about the motion of the sun. Gnomons were most likely independently discovered by many ancient civilizations, but it is known that they were used in the 5th century BC in Greece. Most likely for the measurement of the winter and summer solstices. "[[Herodotus]] says in his ''Histories'' written around 450 B.C., that the [[Greeks]] learned the use of the gnomon from the [[Babylonians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=James|title=The history and Practice of Ancient Astronomy|year=1998|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-509539-1|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
If your shadow is 4 feet long in your own feet, then what is the altitude of the sun? This problem can be solved through the use of the shadow box. The shadow box is divided in half, one half is calibrated by sixes the other by tens. Because it is a shadow cast by the human body the sixes are more convenient. By moving the alidade to the four (the same as your shadows length) and then reading the altitude scale you will see the sun is at an altitude of 56.3 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=James|title=The history and Practice of Ancient Astronomy|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-509539-1|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shadow box can also be used with long shadows using a slightly modified method. If your shadow is 18 feet long, then what is the altitude of the sun? Using the sixes side of the shadow box (because we are using a human body as measurement). The longest shadow marked on a shadow box is six feet, this creates a problem any time the shadow is longer than the gnomon (you) that casts it.  By performing a simple calculation, by figuring out how tall a gnomon would be if it cast a six-foot shadow in the same situation. In this situation the gnomon would be only two feet tall, in order to cast a six-foot shadow. If the shadow is longer than the gnomon, first turn the astrolabe upside down then set the alidade at two, the height of the projected gnomon, then read off the altitude from the altitude scale. It should read that the sun is at 19 degrees above the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=James|title=The history and Practice of Ancient Astronomy|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-509539-1|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sponge grounds''', also known as '''sponge aggregations''', are [[Intertidal zone|intertidal]] to [[Deep sea|deep-sea]] habitats formed by large accumulations of [[sponge]]s ([[Hexactinellid|glass sponges]] and/or [[demosponge]]s), often dominated by a few massive species. Sponge grounds were already reported more than 150 years ago,&lt;ref name=UNEP2010&gt;{{cite journal| authors=Hogg; Tendal; Conway; Pomponi; van Soest; Krautter; and Roberts | year=2010 | title=Deep-sea sponge grounds: Reservoirs of Biodiversity | series=UNEP-WCMC Biodiversity| volume=32 | publisher=[[UNEP-WCMC]] | location=Cambridge, UK | isbn=978-92-807-3081-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the habitat was first fully recognized, studied and described in detail around the [[Faroe Islands]] during the inter-Nordic BIOFAR 1 programme 1987–90.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mass occurrences of large sized sponges (Porifera) in Faroe Island (NE-Atlantic) shelf and slope areas: characteristics, distribution and possible causes|last=Klitgaard|first=Anne|last2=Tendal|first2=Ole Secher|last3=Westerberg|first3=H.|publisher=University of Southampton|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=129–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were called ''Ostur'' (meaning "cheese" and referring to the appearance of the sponges) by the local fishermen and this name has to some extent entered the scientific literature.&lt;ref name=UNEP2010/&gt; Sponge grounds were later found elsewhere in the Northeast Atlantic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klitgaard|first=A.

Sponge grounds are important habitats supporting diverse [[ecosystem]]s. During a study of [[outer shelf]] and upper [[Continental slope|slope]] sponge grounds at the Faroe Islands, 242 invertebrate species were found in the vicinity and 115 were associated with the sponges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=Klitgaard, A.B. | year=1995 | title=The fauna associated with the outer shelf and upper slope sponges (Porifera, Demospongiae) at the Faroe Islands, Northeast Atlantic | journal=Sarsia| volume=80 | issue=1 | pages=1–22 | doi=10.1080/00364827.1995.10413574}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, fish fauna associated with sponge grounds are poorly known, but include [[Sebastes|rockfish]] and [[gadiform]]s.&lt;ref name=UNEP2010/&gt; Sponge grounds are threatened, especially by [[bottom trawling]] and other [[fishing tackle|fishing gear]], [[dredging]], [[oil and gas exploration]] and [[undersea cable]]s, but potentially also by [[deep sea mining]], [[carbon dioxide sequestration]], pollution and [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=UNEP2010/&gt;

== Prehisoric sponge grounds ==
By studying spicules in sediments cores taken from sponge grounds on the slopes of the [[Flemish Cap]] and [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Bank]] (off Newfoundland, Canada), scientists managed to detect the presence of sponges in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murillo|first=F.

Continuous presence of sponges was recorded on the southeastern region of the Flemish Cap as far as 130 000 BP. It seems the distribution range of the [[Geodiidae]] in this area significantly expended after the deglaciation.

'''''StarTalk''''' is an American talk show hosted by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] that airs weekly on [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic.]] ''StarTalk'' is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the [[StarTalk (podcast)|podcast of the same name]], in which Tyson discusses scientific topics through one-on-one interviews and panel discussions. [[Space.com]] called it the "first-ever science-themed late-night talk show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cofield|first1=Calla|url=http://www.space.com/29147-startalk-neil-tyson-science-talk-show.html|website=space.com|title='StarTalk,' NatGeo Channel's 1st Late-Night Science Talk Show, Debuts Tonight}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series premiered on April 20, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-neil-degrasse-tyson-reveals-first-guests-premiere-date-for-startalk-show-20150318-story.html|title=Neil deGrasse Tyson reveals first guests, premiere date for 'StarTalk' show|last=Kevin Day|first=Patrick|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=18 March 2015|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==

The format of the show broadly follows the format of the podcast. This consists of a pre-taped discussion between Tyson and the guest of the week, which is shown in segments interspersed with the segments filmed in front of the live audience. Those segments consist of a discussion between Tyson, a specialist related to the guest's area of expertise, and a comedian (most commonly [[Chuck Nice]] or [[Eugene Mirman]] or [[Maeve Higgins]]). Near the end of the episode, a short taped segment of [[Bill Nye]], giving his view of the episode's topic, is often aired.

'''Theodor Magnus Fries''' (28 October 1832 – 29 March 1913), the son of [[Elias Magnus Fries]], was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[botanist]] and [[lichenologist]]. 

Following in his father's footsteps, Fries studied botany, obtaining his doctoral degree in 1857 at [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]]. He became a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1865 and professor of botany and applied economics at Uppsala in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, Per Magnus. 2001. Th. M. Fries (1832–1913), a Grand Scandinavian Lichenologist. ''[[The Bryologist]]'' 104 (4):537–542&lt;/ref&gt; His most notable work was ''Lichenographia scandinavica'' (1871–1874). He also produced a two-volume biography of [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1903). 

His sons [[Thore Christian Elias Fries]] and [[Robert Elias Fries]] also became botanists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3377">In [[econometrics]] and [[statistics]], a '''top-coded''' data observation is one for which data points whose values are above an upper bound are [[Censoring (statistics)|censored]].

Survey data are often topcoded before release to the public to preserve the anonymity of respondents. For example, if a survey answer reported a respondent with self-identified wealth of $79 billion, it would not be anonymous because people would know there is a good chance the respondent was [[Bill Gates]].  Top-coding may be also applied to prevent possibly-erroneous outliers from being published.

Bottom-coding is analogous, e.g. if amounts below zero are reported as zero.  Top-coding occurs for data recorded in groups, e.g. if age ranges are reported in these groups: 0-20, 21-50, 50-99, 100-and-up.  Here we only know how many people have ages above 100, not their distribution.  Producers of survey data sometimes release the average of the censored amounts to help users impute unbiased estimates of the top group.

Top-coding is a general problem for analysis of public use data sets. Top-coding in the [[Current Population Survey]] makes it hard to estimate measures of income inequality since the shape of the distribution of high incomes is blocked. To help overcome this problem, CPS provides the mean value of top-coded values.&lt;ref&gt;Larrimore, Jeff, Richard V. Burkhauser, Shuaizhang Feng and Laura Zayatz. 2008. Consistent Cell Means for Topcoded Incomes in the Public Use March CPS (1976-2007). ''Journal of Economic and Social Measurement'' 33 (2-3)&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of top-coding, or capping the reported maximum value on tax returns to protect the earner's anonymity, complicates the analysis of the distribution of wealth in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hacker|first=Jacob S. and Paul Pierson|title=Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer--And Turned Its Back on the Middle Class|year=2010|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-8869-6|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for [[ordinary least squares]] estimation==
*If the lower bound of the top-coded group is used as a regressor value (30000 in the example above), OLS is biased and inconsistent since the regressor's highest values are reported with a systematic error.
*The top-coded observations can be omitted from the regression entirely.  Provided there are no systematic differences between the omitted group and the included groups, OLS is consistent and unbiased.
*The [[Tobit model|Tobit]] procedure is robust to top coding, and gives unbiased estimates.

'''Usenet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|uː|z|n|ɛ|t}}) is a worldwide distributed discussion system available on computers. It was developed from the general-purpose [[UUCP|Unix-to-Unix Copy (UUCP)]] [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up]] network architecture. [[Tom Truscott]] and [[Jim Ellis (computing)|Jim Ellis]] conceived the idea in 1979, and it was established in 1980.&lt;ref name="Lueg"&gt;''From Usenet to CoWebs: interacting with social information spaces'', Christopher Lueg, Danyel Fisher, Springer (2003), {{ISBN|1-85233-532-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85233-532-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users read and post messages (called ''articles'' or ''posts'', and collectively termed ''news'') to one or more categories, known as [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroups]]. Usenet resembles a [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) in many respects and is the precursor to [[Internet forum]]s that are widely used today. Discussions are [[Threaded discussion|threaded]], as with web forums and BBSs, though posts are stored on the server sequentially. The name comes from the term "users network".&lt;ref&gt;[http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-4.4.7.dos.txt The jargon file v4.4.7] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105200447/http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-4.4.7.dos.txt |date=January 5, 2016 }}, Jargon File Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~hauben/book/ch106.x03 Chapter 3 - The Social Forces Behind The Development of Usenet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804110914/http://www.columbia.edu/~hauben/book/ch106.x03 |date=August 4, 2016 }}, Netizens Netbook by Ronda Hauben and  Michael Hauben.&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable difference between a BBS or web forum and Usenet is the absence of a central server and dedicated administrator. Usenet is distributed among a large, constantly changing conglomeration of servers that store and forward messages to one another in so-called news feeds. Individual users may read messages from and post messages to a local server operated by a commercial usenet provider, their [[Internet service provider]], university, employer, or their own server.

Usenet has significant cultural importance in the networked world, having given rise to, or popularized, many widely recognized concepts and terms such as "[[FAQ]]", "[[flaming (Internet)|flame]]", and "[[spam (electronic)|spam]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdemon.com/usenet_term_spam.php| title=USENET Newsgroup Terms – SPAM |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120915/http://www.newsdemon.com/usenet_term_spam.php |archivedate=2012-09-15 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Usenet was conceived in 1979 and publicly established in 1980, at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[Duke University]],{{r|emerson198310}}&lt;ref name="Lueg" /&gt; over a decade before the [[World Wide Web]] went online and the general public received access to the [[Internet]], making it one of the oldest [[computer network]] communications systems still in widespread use. It was originally built on the "poor man's [[ARPANET]]", employing UUCP as its transport protocol to offer mail and file transfers, as well as announcements through the newly developed [[Newsreader (Usenet)|news software]] such as [[A News]]. The name Usenet emphasized its creators' hope that the [[USENIX]] organization would take an active role in its operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsdemon.com/first-official-announcement-usenet.php "Invitation to a General Access UNIX Network] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924152631/http://www.newsdemon.com/first-official-announcement-usenet.php |date=September 24, 2012 }}", James Ellis and Tom Truscott, in First Official Announcement of USENET, NewsDemon (K&amp;L Technologies, Inc), 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles that users post to Usenet are organized into topical categories known as [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroups]], which are themselves logically organized into hierarchies of subjects. For instance, ''[news:sci.math sci.math]'' and ''[news:sci.physics sci.physics]'' are within the ''sci.*'' hierarchy, for science. Or, ''[news:talk.origins talk.origins]'' and ''[news:talk.atheism talk.atheism]'' are in the ''talk.*'' hierarchy. When a user subscribes to a newsgroup, the [[news client]] software keeps track of which articles that user has read.&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert, Wendy G.; Kopec, Richard (2007). ''Web 101.'' Addison Wesley. p. 291. {{ISBN|9780321424679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most newsgroups, the majority of the articles are responses to some other article. The set of articles that can be traced to one single non-reply article is called a [[Threaded discussion|thread]]. Most modern newsreaders display the articles arranged into threads and subthreads.

When a user posts an article, it is initially only available on that user's news server. Each news server talks to one or more other servers (its "newsfeeds") and [[#Technical details|exchanges]] articles with them. In this fashion, the article is copied from [[inter-server|server to server]] and should eventually reach every server in the network. The later [[peer-to-peer]] networks operate on a similar principle, but for Usenet it is normally the sender, rather than the receiver, who initiates transfers. Usenet was designed under conditions when networks were much slower and not always available. Many sites on the original Usenet network would connect only once or twice a day to batch-transfer messages in and out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/15-849/store_and_forward.html |title=Store And Forward Communication: UUCP and FidoNet |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/15-849/store_and_forward.html |archivedate=2012-06-30 |deadurl=no}}. Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science.&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely because the [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] network was typically used for transfers, and phone charges were lower at night.

The format and transmission of Usenet articles is similar to that of Internet [[e-mail]] messages. The difference between the two is that Usenet articles can be read by any user whose news server carries the group to which the message was posted, as opposed to email messages, which have one or more specific recipients.&lt;ref&gt;Kozierok, Charles M. (2005). ''The TCP/IP guide: a comprehensive, illustrated Internet protocols reference.'' No Starch Press. p. 1401. {{ISBN|978-159327-047-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Usenet has diminished in importance with respect to [[Internet forum]]s, [[blog]]s and [[mailing list]]s. Usenet differs from such media in several ways: Usenet requires no personal registration with the group concerned; information need not be stored on a remote server; archives are always available; and reading the messages requires not a mail or web client, but a news client. The groups in ''[[alt.binaries]]'' are still widely used for data transfer.

==ISPs, news servers, and newsfeeds==
Many Internet service providers, and many other Internet sites, operate [[news server]]s for their users to access. ISPs that do not operate their own servers directly will often offer their users an account from another provider that specifically operates newsfeeds. In early news implementations, the server and newsreader were a single program suite, running on the same system. Today, one uses separate newsreader client software, a program that resembles an email client but accesses Usenet servers instead. Some clients such as [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] and [[Outlook Express]] provide both abilities.

Not all ISPs run news servers. A news server is one of the most difficult Internet services to administer because of the large amount of data involved, small customer base (compared to mainstream Internet services such as email and web access), and a disproportionately high volume of customer support incidents (frequently complaining of missing news articles that are not the ISP's fault). Some ISPs outsource news operation to specialist sites, which will usually appear to a user as though the ISP ran the server itself. Many sites carry a restricted newsfeed, with a limited number of newsgroups. Commonly omitted from such a newsfeed are foreign-language newsgroups and the ''[[alt.* hierarchy|alt.binaries]]'' hierarchy which largely carries software, music, videos and images, and accounts for over 99 percent of article data.

There are also Usenet providers that specialize in offering service to users whose ISPs do not carry news, or that carry a restricted feed.

See also [[news server operation]] for an overview of how news systems are implemented.

===Newsreaders===
Newsgroups are typically accessed with [[Newsreader (Usenet)|newsreaders]]: applications that allow users to read and reply to postings in newsgroups. These applications act as [[Client (computing)|clients]] to one or more news servers. Although historically, Usenet was associated with the [[Unix]] operating system developed at [[AT&amp;T]], newsreaders are available for all major operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Internet/Clients/Usenet/ |title=Open Directory Usenet Clients |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=October 9, 2008 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730/http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Internet/Clients/Usenet/ |archivedate=2012-07-30 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern mail clients or "communication suites" commonly also have an integrated newsreader. Often, however, these integrated clients are of low quality, compared to standalone newsreaders, and incorrectly implement Usenet protocols, standards and conventions. Many of these integrated clients, for example the one in [[Microsoft]]'s Outlook Express, are disliked by purists because of their misbehavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

With the rise of the World Wide Web (WWW), web [[front end processor (program)|front-ends]] (web2news) have become more common. Web front ends have lowered the technical entry barrier requirements to that of one application and no Usenet NNTP server account. There are numerous websites now offering web based gateways to Usenet groups, although some people have begun filtering messages made by some of the web interfaces for one reason or another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Improve-Usenet| date = October 13, 2008| url = http://improve-usenet.org |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713/http://improve-usenet.org |archivedate=2012-07-13 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Improve-Usenet Comments| date = October 13, 2008| url = http://improve-usenet.org/voices1.html | accessdate =June 29, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080426174022/http://improve-usenet.org/voices1.html |archivedate = April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google Groups]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/ |title=Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120525/http://groups.google.com/ |archivedate=2012-05-25 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one such web based front end and some [[web browser]]s can access Google Groups via news: protocol links directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mykzilla.blogspot.com/2008/11/news-links-to-google-groups.html| title=News: links to Google Groups |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712/http://mykzilla.blogspot.com/2008/11/news-links-to-google-groups.html |archivedate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moderated and unmoderated newsgroups===
A minority of newsgroups are moderated, meaning that messages submitted by readers are not distributed directly to Usenet, but instead are emailed to the moderators of the newsgroup for approval. The moderator is to receive submitted articles, review them, and inject approved articles so that they can be properly propagated worldwide. Articles approved by a moderator must bear the Approved: header line. Moderators ensure that the messages that readers see in the newsgroup conform to the charter of the newsgroup, though they are not required to follow any such rules or guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups#Who_can_force_the_moderators_to_obey_the_group_charter.3F |title=Who can force the moderators to obey the group charter? |publisher=Big-8.org |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804/http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups%23Who_can_force_the_moderators_to_obey_the_group_charter.3F#Who_can_force_the_moderators_to_obey_the_group_charter.3F |archivedate=August 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, moderators are appointed in the proposal for the newsgroup, and changes of moderators follow a succession plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups#How_does_a_group_change_moderators.3F |title=How does a group change moderators? |publisher=Big-8.org |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719/http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups%23How_does_a_group_change_moderators.3F#How_does_a_group_change_moderators.3F |archivedate=July 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, a ''mod.*'' hierarchy existed before Usenet reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/u/ui_early.htm |title=Early Usenet Newsgroup Hierarchies |publisher=Livinginternet.com |date=October 25, 1990 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://www.livinginternet.com/u/ui_early.htm |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, moderated newsgroups may appear in any hierarchy, typically with &lt;tt&gt;.moderated&lt;/tt&gt; added to the group name.

Usenet newsgroups in the [[Big 8 (Usenet)|Big-8 hierarchy]] are created by proposals called a Request for Discussion, or RFD. The RFD is required to have the following information: newsgroup name, checkgroups file entry, and moderated or unmoderated status. If the group is to be moderated, then at least one moderator with a valid email address must be provided. Other information which is beneficial but not required includes: a charter, a rationale, and a moderation policy if the group is to be moderated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.big-8.org/wiki/How_to_Create_a_New_Big-8_Newsgroup |title=How to Create a New Big-8 Newsgroup |publisher=Big-8.org |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722/http://www.big-8.org/wiki/How_to_Create_a_New_Big-8_Newsgroup |archivedate=July 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion of the new newsgroup proposal follows, and is finished with the members of the Big-8 Management Board making the decision, by vote, to either approve or disapprove the new newsgroup.

Unmoderated newsgroups form the majority of Usenet newsgroups, and messages submitted by readers for unmoderated newsgroups are immediately propagated for everyone to see. Minimal editorial content filtering vs propagation speed form one crux of the Usenet community. One little cited defense of propagation is canceling a propagated message, but few Usenet users use this command and some news readers do not offer [[Cancel message#cancel|cancellation commands]], in part because article storage expires in relatively short order anyway. Almost all unmoderated Usenet groups have become collections of [[spam (electronic)|spam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxaoAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;ots=vsxrAQqzZx&amp;dq=usenet%20spam%20prevalence&amp;pg=PA168#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Social Machine: Designs for Living Online|quote=Today, Usenet still exists, but it is an unsociable morass of spam, porn, and pirated software}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/12223/markovian-parallax-denigrate-usenet-spam/|title=Unraveling the Internet’s oldest and weirdest mystery|quote=Groups filled with spam, massive fights took place against spammers and over what to do about the spam.

Creation of moderated newsgroups often becomes a hot subject of controversy, raising issues regarding censorship and the desire of a subset of users to form an [[intentional community]].{{citation needed |date=August 2014}}

===Technical details===
Usenet is a set of protocols for generating, storing and retrieving news "articles" (which resemble Internet mail messages) and for exchanging them among a readership which is potentially widely distributed. These protocols most commonly use a [[flooding algorithm]] which propagates copies throughout a network of participating servers. Whenever a message reaches a server, that server forwards the message to all its network neighbors that haven't yet seen the article. Only one copy of a message is stored per server, and each server makes it available on demand to the (typically local) readers able to access that server. The collection of Usenet servers has thus a certain [[peer-to-peer]] character in that they share resources by exchanging them, the granularity of exchange however is on a different scale than a modern peer-to-peer system and this characteristic excludes the actual users of the system who connect to the news servers with a typical client-server application, much like an email reader.

RFC 850 was the first formal specification of the messages exchanged by Usenet servers. It was superseded by RFC 1036 and subsequently by RFC 5536 and RFC 5537.

In cases where unsuitable content has been posted, Usenet has support for automated removal of a posting from the whole network by creating a cancel message, although due to a lack of authentication and resultant abuse, this capability is frequently disabled. Copyright holders may still request the manual deletion of infringing material using the provisions of [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] treaty implementations, such as the United States [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]], but this would require giving notice to each individual news server administrator.

On the Internet, Usenet is transported via the [[Network News Transfer Protocol]] (NNTP) on [[Computer port (software)|TCP Port]] 119 for standard, unprotected connections and on TCP port 563 for [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] encrypted connections which is offered only by a few sites.

===Organization===
[[File:Usenet Big Nine.svg|thumb|right|The "Big Nine" hierarchies of Usenet]]

The major set of worldwide newsgroups is contained within nine hierarchies, eight of which are operated under consensual guidelines that govern their administration and naming. The current ''[[Big 8 (Usenet)|Big Eight]]'' are:
* ''comp.*'' – computer-related discussions (''comp.software'', ''comp.sys.amiga'')
* ''humanities.*'' – [[fine art]]s, [[literature]], and [[philosophy]] (''humanities.classics'', ''humanities.design.misc'')
* ''misc.*'' – miscellaneous topics (''misc.education'', ''misc.forsale'', ''misc.kids'')
* ''news.*'' – discussions and announcements about news (meaning Usenet, not current events) (''news.groups'', ''news.admin'')
* ''rec.*'' – recreation and entertainment (''rec.music'', ''rec.arts.movies'')
* ''sci.*'' – science related discussions (''sci.psychology'', ''sci.research'')
* ''soc.*'' – social discussions (''soc.college.org'', ''soc.culture.{{sic|hide=y|african}}'')
* ''talk.*'' – talk about various controversial topics (''talk.religion'', ''talk.politics'', ''[[talk.origins]]'')

The [[alt.* hierarchy|''alt.*'' hierarchy]] is not subject to the procedures controlling groups in the Big Eight, and it is as a result less organized. Groups in the ''alt.*'' hierarchy tend to be more specialized or specific—for example, there might be a newsgroup under the Big Eight which contains discussions about children's books, but a group in the alt hierarchy may be dedicated to one specific author of children's books. [[Binaries]] are posted in ''alt.binaries.*'', making it the largest of all the hierarchies.

Many other hierarchies of newsgroups are distributed alongside these. Regional and language-specific hierarchies such as ''{{sic|hide=y|japan}}.*'', ''{{sic|hide=y|malta}}.*'' and ''ne.*'' serve specific countries and regions such as [[Japan]], [[Malta]] and [[New England]]. Companies and projects administer their own hierarchies to discuss their products and offer community technical support, such as the historical ''{{sic|hide=y|gnu}}.*'' hierarchy from the [[Free Software Foundation]]. [[Microsoft]] closed its newsserver in June 2010, providing support for its products over forums now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/default.mspx Microsoft Responds to the Evolution of Communities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918084608/http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/default.mspx |date=September 18, 2012 }}, Announcement, undated. {{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20004109-56.html |title=Microsoft hitting 'unsubscribe' on newsgroups |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712/http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20004109-56.html |archivedate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=no }}, CNET, May 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some users prefer to use the term "Usenet" to refer only to the Big Eight hierarchies; others include alt as well. The more general term "netnews" incorporates the entire medium, including private organizational news systems.

Informal sub-hierarchy conventions also exist. ''*.answers'' are typically moderated cross-post groups for FAQs. An FAQ would be posted within one group and a cross post to the ''*.answers'' group at the head of the hierarchy seen by some as a refining of information in that news group. Some subgroups are recursive—to the point of some silliness in ''alt.*''{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}.

===Binary content===
[[File:Usenet Binaries Upload process.PNG|thumb|300px|A visual example of the many complex steps required to prepare data to be uploaded to Usenet newsgroups. These steps must be done again in reverse to download data from Usenet.]]

Usenet was originally created to distribute text content encoded in the 7-[[bit]] [[ASCII]] character set. With the help of programs that encode 8-bit values into ASCII, it became practical to distribute [[binary file]]s as content. Binary posts, due to their size and often-dubious copyright status, were in time restricted to specific newsgroups, making it easier for administrators to allow or disallow the traffic.

The oldest widely used encoding method for binary content is [[uuencode]], from the [[Unix]] UUCP package. In the late 1980s, Usenet articles were often limited to 60,000 characters, and larger hard limits exist today. Files are therefore commonly split into sections that require reassembly by the reader.

With the header extensions and the [[Base64]] and Quoted-Printable [[MIME]] encodings, there was a new generation of binary transport. In practice, MIME has seen increased adoption in text messages, but it is avoided for most binary attachments. Some operating systems with [[metadata (computing)|metadata]] attached to files use specialized encoding formats. For Mac OS, both [[Binhex]] and special MIME types are used.

Other lesser known encoding systems that may have been used at one time were [[BTOA]], [[Xxencode|XX encoding]], [[BOO (encoding)|BOO]], and [[USR encoding]].

In an attempt to reduce file transfer times, an informal file encoding known as [[yEnc]] was introduced in 2001. It achieves about a 30% reduction in data transferred by assuming that most 8-bit characters can safely be transferred across the network without first encoding into the 7-bit ASCII space.

The most common method of uploading large binary posts to Usenet is to convert the files into [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] archives and create [[Parchive]] files for them. Parity files are used to recreate missing data when not every part of the files reaches a server.

====Binary retention time====
[[File:Usenet-total-storage.jpg|thumb|300px|This is a list of some of the biggest binary groups. With 1341+ days retention, the (binary) Usenet storage (which binsearch.info indexes) is more than 33 [[petabyte]]s (33000 [[terabyte]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.binsearch.info/groupinfo.php |title=Usenet storage is more than 33 petabytes (33000 terabytes) |publisher=binsearch.info |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/https://www.binsearch.info/groupinfo.php |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Each news server generally allocates a certain amount of storage space for post content in each newsgroup. When this storage has been filled, each time a new post arrives, old posts are deleted to make room for the new content. If the network bandwidth available to a server is high but the storage allocation is small, it is possible for a huge flood of incoming content to overflow the allocation and push out everything that was in the group before it. If the flood is large enough, the beginning of the flood will begin to be deleted even before the last part of the flood has been posted.

Binary newsgroups are only able to function reliably if there is sufficient storage allocated to a group to allow readers enough time to download all parts of a binary posting before it is flushed out of the group's storage allocation. This was at one time how posting of undesired content was countered; the newsgroup would be flooded with random garbage data posts, of sufficient quantity to push out all the content to be suppressed. This has been compensated by service providers allocating enough storage to retain everything posted each day, including such spam floods, without deleting anything.

The average length of time that posts are able to stay in the group before being deleted is commonly called the ''retention time''. Generally the larger Usenet servers have enough capacity to archive several years of binary content even when flooded with new data at the maximum daily speed available. A good binaries service provider must not only accommodate users of fast connections (3 megabit) but also users of slow connections (256 kilobit or less) who need more time to download content over a period of several days or weeks.

Major NSPs{{what|date=July 2018}} have a retention time of more than 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giganews.com/faq.html#q0.4 |title=Giganews FAQ – How long are articles available? |publisher=Giganews.com |accessdate=October 23, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120904/http://www.giganews.com/faq.html%23q0.4 |archivedate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This results in more than 33 [[petabyte]]s (33000 [[terabyte]]s) of storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giganews.com/blog/2011/05/announcing-1000-days-retention-prize.html
 |title=9 petabyte of usenet storage on giganews.com |publisher=giganews.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://www.giganews.com/blog/2011/05/announcing-1000-days-retention-prize.html |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part because of such long retention times, as well as growing Internet [[upload]] speeds, Usenet is also used by individual users to store [[backup]] data in a practice called ''Usenet backup'', or uBackup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Backup-Your-Data-on-Usenet-%28Ubackup%29 |title=usenet backup (uBackup) |publisher=Wikihow.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918/http://www.wikihow.com/Backup-Your-Data-on-Usenet-%28Ubackup%29 |archivedate=2012-09-18 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While commercial providers offer more [[ease of use|easy to use]] [[List of online backup services|online backup services]], storing data on Usenet is free of charge (although access to Usenet itself may not be). The method requires the user to [[Backup#Data repository models|manually select, prepare and upload the data]]. Because anyone can potentially download the backup files, the data is typically [[encryption|encrypted]]. After the files are uploaded, the uploader does not have any control over them; the files are automatically copied to all Usenet providers, so there will be multiple copies of it spread over different geographical locations around the world—desirable in a backup scheme.

====Legal issues====
While binary newsgroups can be used to distribute completely legal user-created works, open-source software, and public domain material, some binary groups are used to illegally distribute commercial software, copyrighted media, and obscene material.

ISP-operated Usenet servers frequently block access to all ''alt.binaries.*'' groups to both reduce network traffic and to avoid related legal issues. Commercial Usenet service providers claim to operate as a telecommunications service, and assert that they are not responsible for the user-posted binary content transferred via their equipment. In the United States, Usenet providers can qualify for protection under the [[DMCA]] [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|Safe Harbor regulations]], provided that they establish a mechanism to comply with and respond to takedown notices from copyright holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supernews.com/docs/dmca.html |title=Digital Millenium Copyright Act|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910/http://www.supernews.com/docs/dmca.html |archivedate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Removal of copyrighted content from the entire Usenet network is a nearly impossible task, due to the rapid propagation between servers and the retention done by each server. Petitioning a Usenet provider for removal only removes it from that one server's retention cache, but not any others. It is possible for a special ''post cancellation'' message to be distributed to remove it from all servers, but many providers ignore [[Cancel message|cancel]] messages by standard policy, because they can be easily falsified and submitted by anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cancel Messages FAQ |url=http://wiki.killfile.org/projects/usenet/faqs/cancel/|accessdate=June 29, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215161039/http://www.killfile.org/faqs/cancel.html |archivedate=February 15, 2008 |quote=...Until authenticated cancels catch on, there are no options to avoid forged cancels and allow unforged ones...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft knowledgebase article stating that many servers ignore cancel messages {{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q164420/ |title=Support.microsoft.com |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q164420/ |archivedate=2012-07-19 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a takedown petition to be most effective across the whole network, it would have to be issued to the origin server to which the content has been posted, before it has been propagated to other servers. Removal of the content at this early stage would prevent further propagation, but with modern high speed links, content can be propagated as fast as it arrives, allowing no time for content review and takedown issuance by copyright holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.measurement.sk/2005/S1/Surmacz.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Surmacz.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521051120/http://www.measurement.sk/2005/S1/Surmacz.pdf |archive-date=May 21, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishing the identity of the person posting illegal content is equally difficult due to the trust-based design of the network. Like [[SMTP]] email, servers generally assume the header and origin information in a post is true and accurate. However, as in SMTP email, Usenet post headers are easily falsified so as to obscure the true identity and location of the message source.&lt;ref&gt;''...every part of a Usenet post may be forged apart from the left most portion of the "Path:" header...'' {{cite web |url=http://www.by-users.co.uk/faqs/email/headers/ |title=By-users.co.uk |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723/http://www.by-users.co.uk/faqs/email/headers/ |archivedate=2012-07-23 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, Usenet is significantly different from modern P2P services; most P2P users distributing content are typically immediately identifiable to all other users by their [[network address]], but the origin information for a Usenet posting can be completely obscured and unobtainable once it has propagated past the original server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|message-id=StUPidfuk01@uunet.uu.net|newsgroup=news.admin.misc|title=Better living through forgery |url=http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.misc/msg/9f6aa173f228ac6a?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain|date=1995-06-10 |accessdate=December 5, 2014|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120724/http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.misc/msg/9f6aa173f228ac6a?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-24 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also unlike modern P2P services, the identity of the downloaders is hidden from view. On P2P services a downloader is identifiable to all others by their network address. On Usenet, the downloader connects directly to a server, and only the server knows the address of who is connecting to it. Some Usenet providers do keep usage logs, but not all make this logged information casually available to outside parties such as the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giganews.com/legal/privacy.html |title=Giganews Privacy Policy |publisher=Giganews.com |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120731/http://www.giganews.com/legal/privacy.html |archivedate=2012-07-31 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aioe.org/index.php?logging-policy |title=Logging Policy |publisher=Aioe.org |date=June 9, 2005 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708/http://aioe.org/index.php?logging-policy |archivedate=July 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of anonymising gateways to USENET also complicates the tracing of a postings true origin.

"[http://www.columbia.edu/~rh120/ Netizens: On the History and Impact of Usenet and the Internet, On the Early Days of Usenet: The Roots of the Cooperative Online Culture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610060052/http://www.columbia.edu/~rh120/ |date=June 10, 2015 }}".

===Network===
UUCP networks spread quickly due to the lower costs involved, and the ability to use existing leased lines, [[X.25]] links or even [[ARPANET]] connections. By 1983, thousands of people participated from more than 500 hosts, mostly universities and Bell Labs sites but also a growing number of Unix-related companies; the number of hosts nearly doubled to 940 in 1984. More than 100 newsgroups existed, more than 20 devoted to Unix and other computer-related topics, and at least a third to recreation.&lt;ref&gt;Haddadi, H. (2006). "[http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~hamed/papers/mphil.pdf Network Traffic Inference Using Sampled Statistics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117133532/http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~hamed/papers/mphil.pdf |date=November 17, 2015 }}". University College London.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|emerson198310}} As the mesh of UUCP hosts rapidly expanded, it became desirable to distinguish the Usenet subset from the overall network. A vote was taken at the 1982 USENIX conference to choose a new name. The name Usenet was retained, but it was established that it only applied to news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Horton| first = Mark| title = Arachnet| date = December 11, 1990 |url = http://communication.ucsd.edu/bjones/Usenet.Hist/Nethist/0111.html |accessdate=4 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://communication.ucsd.edu/bjones/Usenet.Hist/Nethist/0111.html |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name UUCPNET became the common name for the overall network.

In addition to UUCP, early Usenet traffic was also exchanged with [[Fidonet]] and other dial-up [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] networks. Widespread use of Usenet by the BBS community was facilitated by the introduction of UUCP feeds made possible by MS-DOS implementations of UUCP, such as UFGATE (UUCP to FidoNet Gateway), FSUUCP and UUPC. In 1986, RFC 977 provided the [[Network News Transfer Protocol]] (NNTP) specification for distribution of Usenet articles over [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] as a more flexible alternative to informal Internet transfers of UUCP traffic. Since the Internet boom of the 1990s, almost all Usenet distribution is over NNTP.&lt;ref&gt;Huston, Geoff (1999). ''ISP survival guide: strategies for running a competitive ISP.'' Wiley. p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software===
Early versions of Usenet used Duke's [[A News]] software, designed for one or two articles a day. Matt Glickman and Horton at Berkeley produced an improved version called [[B News]] that could handle the rising traffic (about 50 articles a day as of late 1983).{{r|emerson198310}} With a message format that offered compatibility with Internet mail and improved performance, it became the dominant server software. [[C News]], developed by [[Geoff Collyer]] and [[Henry Spencer]] at the [[University of Toronto]], was comparable to B News in features but offered considerably faster processing. In the early 1990s, [[InterNetNews]] by [[Rich Salz]] was developed to take advantage of the continuous message flow made possible by NNTP versus the batched store-and-forward design of UUCP. Since that time [[InterNetNews|INN]] development has continued, and other news server software has also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsreaders.com/unix/servers.html |title=Unix/Linux news servers |publisher=Newsreaders.com |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120905/http://www.newsreaders.com/unix/servers.html |archivedate=2012-09-05 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public venue===
Usenet was the first Internet community and the place for many of the most important public developments in the pre-commercial Internet. It was the place where [[Tim Berners-Lee]] announced the launch of the [[World Wide Web]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup| title = WorldWideWeb: Summary| author = Tim Berners-Lee| date = August 6, 1991| newsgroup = alt.hypertext|message-id= 6487@cernvax.cern.ch|url = http://groups.google.com/group/alt.hypertext/msg/395f282a67a1916c| accessdate =June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Linus Torvalds]] announced the [[Linux]] project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup | title = What would you like to see most in minix? | newsgroup = comp.os.minix |message-id= 1991Aug25.205708.9541@klaava.Helsinki.FI |url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/msg/b813d52cbc5a044b | last = Torvalds | first = Linus | accessdate =September 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and where [[Marc Andreessen]] announced the creation of the [[Mosaic browser]] and the introduction of the image tag,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup| title = NCSA Mosaic for X 0.10 available.| author = Marc Andreessen| date = March 15, 1993| newsgroup = comp.infosystems.gopher, comp.infosystems.wais, comp.infosystems, alt.hypertext, comp.windows.x| message-id = MARCA.93Mar14225600@wintermute.ncsa.uiuc.edu| url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/msg/7fde2f6d4d5dc4e7| accessdate = 4 June 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060616013046/http://groups.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/msg/7fde2f6d4d5dc4e7| archive-date = June 16, 2006| dead-url = no| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which revolutionized the World Wide Web by turning it into a graphical medium.

===Internet jargon and history===
Many [[jargon]] terms now in common use on the Internet originated or were popularized on Usenet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, many conflicts which later spread to the rest of the Internet, such as the ongoing difficulties over [[spam (electronic)|spamming]], began on Usenet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=K.

===Decline===
Sascha Segan of ''[[PC Magazine]]'' said in 2008 that "Usenet has been dying for years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Segan |first1=Sascha |title=R.I.P Usenet: 1980-2008 |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |accessdate=July 21, 2017 |work=PC Magazine |date=July 31, 2008 |language=en |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |archive-date=September 9, 2012 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Segan said that some people pointed to the [[Eternal September]] in 1993 as the beginning of Usenet's decline. Segan believes that when pornographers and software [[Copyright infringement|crackers]] began putting large (non-text) files on Usenet by the late 1990s, Usenet [[disk space]] and traffic increased correspondingly. Internet service providers questioned why they needed to host space for pornography and unauthorized software.  When the [[State of New York]] opened an investigation on [[child pornographer]]s who used Usenet, many ISPs dropped all Usenet access or access to the [[alt.* hierarchy|''alt.*'' hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |title=R.I.P Usenet: 1980–2008 |work=PC Magazine |author=Sascha Segan |date=July 31, 2008 |page=2|accessdate=May 8, 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |archivedate=2012-09-09 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, John Biggs of [[TechCrunch]] said "As long as there are folks who think a [[command line]] is better than a mouse, the original text-only [[Social networking service|social network]] will live on".&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/08/01/the-reports-of-usenets-death-are-greatly-exaggerated/ |title=Reports of Usenet's Death Are Greatly Exaggerated |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716/http://techcrunch.com/2008/08/01/the-reports-of-usenets-death-are-greatly-exaggerated/ |archivedate=2012-07-16 |deadurl=no}}."

[[AOL]] discontinued Usenet access in 2005. In May 2010, [[Duke University]], whose implementation had kicked off Usenet more than 30 years earlier, decommissioned its Usenet server, citing low usage and rising costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.duke.edu/2010/05/usenet.html |title=A Piece of Internet History |work=Duke Today |author=Cara Bonnett|date=May 17, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711/http://news.duke.edu/2010/05/usenet.html |archivedate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/20/usenet_duke_server/ |title=Usenet's home shuts down today |work=The Register |author=Andrew Orlowski |date=May 20, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/20/usenet_duke_server/ |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After 32 years, the Usenet news service link at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (news.unc.edu) was retired on February 4, 2011.

==Usenet traffic changes==
Over time, the amount of Usenet traffic has steadily increased. {{As of | 2010}} the number of all text posts made in all Big-8 newsgroups averaged 1,800 new messages every hour, with an average of 25,000 messages per day.&lt;ref name="newsadmin1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsadmin.com/top100tmsgs.asp |title=Top 100 text newsgroups by postings |publisher=NewsAdmin |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016004305/http://www.newsadmin.com/top100tmsgs.asp |archivedate=October 16, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these averages are minuscule in comparison to the traffic in the binary groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsadmin.com/top100bmsgs.asp |title=Top 100 binary newsgroups by postings |publisher=NewsAdmin |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016004534/http://www.newsadmin.com/top100bmsgs.asp |archivedate=October 16, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this traffic increase reflects not an increase in discrete users or newsgroup discussions, but instead the combination of massive automated spamming and an increase in the use of ''.binaries'' newsgroups&lt;ref name="newsadmin1"/&gt; in which large files are often posted publicly. A small sampling of the change (measured in feed size per day) follows:

[[Microsoft]] announced that it would discontinue support for its public newsgroups (msnews.microsoft.com) from June 1, 2010, offering web forums as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/default.mspx#EV | title=Microsoft Responds to the Evolution of Communities | publisher=microsoft.com | accessdate=September 1, 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030622131419/http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/default.mspx#EV | archivedate=June 22, 2003 | deadurl=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary reasons cited for the discontinuance of Usenet service by general [[Internet service provider|ISPs]] include the decline in volume of actual readers due to competition from [[blog]]s, along with cost and liability concerns of increasing proportion of traffic devoted to file-sharing and spam on unused or discontinued groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/AOL-shutting-down-newsgroups/2100-1032_3-5550036.html | title=AOL shutting down newsgroups | publisher=cnet.com/ | date=January 25, 2005 | accessdate=September 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829012327/http://news.cnet.com/AOL-shutting-down-newsgroups/2100-1032_3-5550036.html |archivedate=2008-08-29 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Verizon-To-Discontinue-Newsgroups-September-30-104227 | title=Verizon To Discontinue Newsgroups | publisher=dslreports.com | date=August 31, 2009 | accessdate=September 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306031517/http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Verizon-To-Discontinue-Newsgroups-September-30-104227 |archivedate=2012-03-06 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ISPs did not include pressure from [[Attorney General of New York]] [[Andrew Cuomo]]'s aggressive campaign against child pornography as one of their reasons for dropping Usenet feeds as part of their services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r21120658-The-Comcast-Newsgroups-Service-Discontinued | title=The Comcast Newsgroups Service Discontinued | publisher=dslreports.com | date=September 16, 2008 | accessdate=December 5, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206015500/http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r21120658-The-Comcast-Newsgroups-Service-Discontinued |archivedate=December 6, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISPs Cox and Atlantic Communications resisted the 2008 trend but both did eventually drop their respective Usenet feeds in 2010.&lt;ref name=dropun&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeropaid.com/news/88729/cox-to-drop-free-usenet-service-june-30th/ |title=Cox to Drop Free Usenet Service June 30th |publisher=Zeropaid.com |date=April 22, 2010 |accessdate=September 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://www.zeropaid.com/news/88729/cox-to-drop-free-usenet-service-june-30th/ |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coxatlantic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/04/21/210224/Cox-Discontinues-Usenet-Starting-In-June | title=Cox Discontinues Usenet, Starting In June | publisher=Geeknet, Inc | date=April 21, 2010 | accessdate=September 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/04/21/210224/Cox-Discontinues-Usenet-Starting-In-June |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thundernews.com/blog/tag/isp/ | title=Cox Communications and Atlantic Broadband Discontinue Usenet Access | publisher=thundernews.com | date=April 27, 2010 | accessdate=September 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912/http://www.thundernews.com/blog/tag/isp/ |archivedate=2012-09-12 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives==
Public archives of Usenet articles have existed since the early days of Usenet, such as the system created by Kenneth Almquist in late 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.general/msg/ba3ad51d0cedd76b?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=How to obtain back news items |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710/http://groups.google.com/group/net.general/msg/ba3ad51d0cedd76b?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-10 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distributed archiving of Usenet posts was suggested in November 1982 by Scott Orshan, who proposed that "Every site should keep all the articles it posted, forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/e8145eace8aa0529?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Distributed archiving of netnews |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708/http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/e8145eace8aa0529?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-08 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in November of that year, Rick Adams responded to a post asking "Has anyone archived netnews, or does anyone plan to?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/a9ad42b15688b910?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Archive of netnews |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120724/http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/a9ad42b15688b910?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-24 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; by stating that he was, "afraid to admit it, but I started archiving most 'useful' newsgroups as of September 18."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/87c9160730b36989?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Re: Archive of netnews |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715/http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/87c9160730b36989?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1982, Gregory G. Woodbury proposed an "automatic access to archives" system that consisted of "automatic answering of fixed-format messages to a special mail recipient on specified machines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.general/msg/a377e12ab1a829ff?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Automatic access to archives |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712/http://groups.google.com/group/net.general/msg/a377e12ab1a829ff?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, two news archiving systems and one [[Request for Comments|RFC]] were posted to the Internet. The first system, called keepnews, by Mark M. Swenson of [[The University of Arizona]], was described as "a program that attempts to provide a sane way of extracting and keeping information that comes over Usenet." The main advantage of this system was to allow users to mark articles as worthwhile to retain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.sources/msg/737d29fd3af2d5ae?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=keepnews – A Usenet news archival system |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717/http://groups.google.com/group/net.sources/msg/737d29fd3af2d5ae?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-17 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second system, YA News Archiver by Chuq Von Rospach, was similar to keepnews, but was "designed to work with much larger archives where the wonderful quadratic search time feature of the Unix ... becomes a real problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.sources/msg/d5c0cec804f745dd?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=YA News Archiver |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709/http://groups.google.com/group/net.sources/msg/d5c0cec804f745dd?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-09 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Rospach in early 1985 posted a detailed RFC for "archiving and accessing usenet articles with [[Index term|keyword]] lookup." This RFC described a program that could "generate and
maintain an archive of Usenet articles and allow looking up articles based on the article-id, subject lines, or keywords pulled out of the article itself." Also included was [[C (programming language)|C]] code for the internal data structure of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/f26190057834ed87?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=RFC usenet article archive program with keyword lookup |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715/http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/f26190057834ed87?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire to have a fulltext search index of archived news articles is not new either, one such request having been made in April 1991 by [[Alex Martelli]] who sought to "build
some sort of keyword index for [the news archive]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/news.software.nn/msg/16381a7e3fd611d4?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Looking for fulltext indexing software for archived news |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://groups.google.com/group/news.software.nn/msg/16381a7e3fd611d4?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early May, Mr. Martelli posted a summary of his responses to Usenet, noting that the "most popular suggestion award must definitely go to 'lq-text' package, by Liam Quin, recently posted in alt.sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/news.software.nn/msg/f503efa9034f1c1d?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Summary: search for fulltext indexing software for archived news |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708/http://groups.google.com/group/news.software.nn/msg/f503efa9034f1c1d?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-08 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The huge site http://asstr.org archives and indexes erotic and pornographic stories posted to the Usenet group alt.sex.stories.

Today, the archiving of Usenet has led to a fear of loss of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |title=R.I.P Usenet: 1980–2008 – Usenet's Decline – Columns by PC Magazine |publisher=Pcmag.com |date=January 1, 1970 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |first=Sascha |last=Segan |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |archivedate=2012-09-09 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; An archive simplifies ways to profile people. This has partly been countered with the introduction of the '' [[X-No-Archive|X-No-Archive: Yes]]'' header, which is itself controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Strawbridge, Matthew (2006). ''Netiquette: Internet Etiquette in the Age of the Blog.'' Software Reference. p. 53. {{ISBN|978-0955461408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archives by Google Groups and DejaNews===
{{Main|Google Groups}}

Web-based archiving of Usenet posts began in 1995 at [[Deja News]] with a very large, searchable database. In 2001, this database was acquired by [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Drew (February 12, 2001). {{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/02/12/google_saves_deja_com_usenet/ |title=Google saves Deja.com Usenet service |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/02/12/google_saves_deja_com_usenet/ |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}. ''[[The Register]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Google Groups hosts an archive of Usenet posts dating back to May 1981. The earliest posts, which date from May 1981 to June 1991, were donated to Google by the [[University of Western Ontario]] with the help of [[David Wiseman]] and others,&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, David. [http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~magi/personal/usenet.html "Magi's NetNews Archive Involvement"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20050209012732/http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~magi/personal/usenet.html |date=February 9, 2005 }}, csd.uwo.ca.&lt;/ref&gt; and were originally archived by [[Henry Spencer]] at the University of Toronto's Zoology department.&lt;ref&gt;Mieszkowski, Katharine. "{{cite web |url=http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/01/07/saving_usenet/index.html |title=The Geeks Who Saved Usenet |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710/http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/01/07/saving_usenet/index.html |archivedate=July 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}", archive.salon.com (January 7, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The archives for late 1991 through early 1995 were provided by Kent Landfield from the NetNews CD series&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Ian. {{cite web |url=http://db.tidbits.com/article/3229 |title=Usenet on a CD-ROM, no longer a fable |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707/http://db.tidbits.com/article/3229 |archivedate=2012-07-07 |deadurl=no}}, "TidBITS" (February 10, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and Jürgen Christoffel from [[Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung|GMD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.misc/msg/6dec509043e7b3c7?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Google Groups Archive Information |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709/http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.misc/msg/6dec509043e7b3c7?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-09 |deadurl=no}} (December 21, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The archive of posts from March 1995 onward was started by the company [[DejaNews]] (later Deja), which was purchased by Google in February 2001. Google began archiving Usenet posts for itself starting in the second week of August 2000.

Google has been criticized by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' and [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] contributors as well as former employees for its stewardship of the archive and for breaking its search functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.wired.com/2009/10/usenet|title = Google’s Abandoned Library of 700 Million Titles|website = Wired|last = Poulsen|first = Kevin|access-date = March 12, 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170309162758/https://www.wired.com/2009/10/usenet/|archive-date = March 9, 2017|dead-url = no|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://motherboard.vice.com/read/google-a-search-company-has-made-its-internet-archive-impossible-to-search|title = Google, a Search Company, Has Made Its Internet Archive Impossible to Search|website = Motherboard|last = Braga|first = Matthew|access-date = August 30, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150905023932/http://motherboard.vice.com/read/google-a-search-company-has-made-its-internet-archive-impossible-to-search|archive-date = September 5, 2015|dead-url = no|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = I'm Feeling Lucky: The Confessions of Google Employee Number 59|last = Edwards|first = Douglas|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-547-41699-1|pages = 209–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;
