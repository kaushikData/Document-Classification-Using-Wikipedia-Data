==Biography==
She was born on July 24, 1871, as '''Abby Pearce Scott''' in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], to Robert Nicholson Scott (1838&amp;ndash;1887) and Elizabeth Goodale Casey (1844&amp;ndash;1912). Her father and grandfather were Army officers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2BJygCeSLQC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;dq=Abby+Scott+Baker+sons&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_7p7GiaPQAhVDfiYKHQbXBCkQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Abby%20Scott%20Baker%20sons&amp;f=false|title=American Feminism: Key Source Documents, 1848-1920|last=Beer|first=Janet|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415219457|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was educated at the Norwood Institute.

She married Robert Walker Baker (1863&amp;ndash;1956) around 1893.  The couple had three sons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Suffrage activist ==
Bakers was one of [[Alice Paul]]’s earliest associates. She helped Alice Paul and [[Lucy Burns]] plan their first major event–the March 3, 1913, national suffrage parade on the eve of Woodrow Wilson’s inauguration.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

In 1914 she served as treasurer of the [[Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/static/women-of-protest/articles-and-essays/selected-leaders-of-the-national-womans-party/lobbyists.html |title=Abby Scott Baker (1871-1944) |date= |accessdate=2014-07-23 |quote= |publisher= |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker traveled the country as part of the Congressional Union’s “Suffrage Special” train tour of western states in April–May 1916. Baker was in charge of handling the press for the tour. The support that she helped raise from women in states that had already granted women’s suffrage.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;  On April 29, Baker wrote to ''The Suffragist'' on how the tour was received '[Men] invariably call out, 'Here come the Suffragettes,' but very soon they are saying, 'She's all right,' and 'That's straight lady,' or some such approving phrase..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924030480556/cu31924030480556_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "The story of the Woman's Party"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tour culminated in a June 1916 meeting in Chicago to form what was at first called the Woman’s Party of Western Voters, or Woman’s Party, for short (NWP). When the NWP was more formally organized in relation to the CU in March 1917, Baker was elected to the NWP executive committee and served as its press chairman (1917-18) and political chairman (1917; 1919-21).&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Baker was among the first demonstrators to picket the White House; she was arrested in September 1917 and sentenced to 60 days in the [[Lorton Reformatory|Occoquan Workhouse]]. In February–March 1919, she served as publicity manager and speaker for the “Prison Special,” a three-week lecture tour by NWP activists who spoke to packed audiences about their jail experiences in an effort to generate support for the suffrage cause.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; The other speakers included [[Lillian Ascough]], [[Harriot Stanton Blatch]] and [[Lucy Burns]]. They spoke publicly, distributed literature, and sold the [[The Suffragist|''Suffragist''.]] This tour was credited with arousing interest in federal suffrage among, prospective, voting age women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/archive/suffragists/SuffragistsSpeak/1916.html|title=Suffragists Timeline: 1916|website=groups.ischool.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the NWP’s patriotism was challenged, she reminded critics that her three sons were fighting in World War I.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Baker maintained an intense travel schedule before and during the campaign season for the [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 presidential election]], shuttling between the campaign headquarters of [[Warren G. Harding]] in Ohio and [[James M. Cox]] in Tennessee, building close relationships with both candidates. Baker's indefatigable efforts drew a great deal of media attention, and helped to normalize the presence of women in the political sphere in the public imagination.&lt;ref name="milcit" /&gt;

== Later life ==
After suffrage was achieved, Baker became a member of the NWP’s Committee on International Relations and the Women’s Consultative Committee of the League of Nations. She also represented the NWP at the League’s 1935 international conferences in Geneva where the issue of equal rights was discussed.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

She died on May 13, 1944, in [[Washington, DC]].

'''Absadah''' was a [[Christian]] [[priest]] and [[martyr]].

==Life==
He was born near Behnesa, [[Egypt]], {{circa}} 300. He was a priest to a small congregation in his village.  Upon the start of the [[Diocletian Persecution]], Absadah barricaded himself in his home, planning to hide from persecution, and losing faith in the protection of the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;[http://365rosaries.blogspot.gr/2010/01/january-19-saint-absadah-of-egypt.html/ January 19: Saint Absadah of Egypt, posted by Jacob] Retrieved on 19 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he recounted a vision of [[Jesus]] appearing before him. After that vision of Jesus Absadah had only two options: to deny his faith or to learn again to trust the God who had been executed. He voluntarily came before the court, and was sent to [[Alexandria]]. In Alexandria, he was visited by Jules D'acfahs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttstm.com/2018/01/january-19-absadah-martyr-priest.html/ January 19 - Absadah, Martyr, Priest BY JOSHUA HEARNE] Retrieved on 19 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
His [[death sentence]] was to be burnt alive.  However, he was [[executed]] by [[Decapitation|beheading]]. It was performed outside the walls of the city. He was buried at [[Cairo]].

==Sainthood==
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has commemorated Absadah as a [[saint]], with a [[feast day]] of January 19.

'''Agent-based computational economics''' ('''ACE''') is the area of [[computational economics]] that studies economic processes, including whole [[economy|economies]], as [[dynamic system]]s of interacting [[Agent (economics)|agents]]. As such, it falls in the [[paradigm]] of [[complex adaptive system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;• [[W. Brian Arthur]], 1994.

The method has benefited from continuing improvements in modeling techniques of [[computer science]] and increased computer capabilities.

==Overview==
The "[[Agent (economics)|agents]]" in ACE models can represent individuals (e.g. people), social groupings (e.g. firms), biological entities (e.g. growing crops), and/or physical systems (e.g. transport systems). The ACE modeler provides the initial configuration of a computational economic system comprising multiple interacting agents. The modeler then steps back to observe the development of the system over time without further intervention. In particular, system events should be driven by agent interactions without external imposition of equilibrium conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socsci.aau.dk/ae2006/ Summary of methods]: ''Department of Economics, Politics and Public Administration, Aalborg University, Denmark'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues include those common to [[experimental economics]] in general&lt;ref&gt;[[Vernon L. Smith]], 2008. "experimental economics," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000277&amp;q=experimental%20&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=2 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; and development of a common framework for empirical validation and resolving open questions in agent-based modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Fagiolo, Alessio Moneta, and Paul Windrum, 2007. "A Critical Guide to Empirical Validation of Agent-Based Models in Economics: Methodologies, Procedures, and Open Problems," ''Computational Economics'', 30, pp. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t683473172528275/ 195]–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

ACE is an officially designated special interest group (SIG) of the Society for Computational Economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comp-econ.org/ Society for Computational Economics] website.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] have contributed to the development of ACE.

==Example: finance==
One area where ACE methodology has frequently been applied is asset pricing. [[W. Brian Arthur]], Eric Baum, [[William A. Brock (economist)|William Brock]], Cars Hommes, and Blake LeBaron, among others, have developed computational models in which many agents choose from a set of possible forecasting strategies in order to predict stock prices, which affects their asset demands and thus affects stock prices. These models assume that agents are more likely to choose forecasting strategies which have recently been successful. The success of any strategy will depend on market conditions and also on the set of strategies that are currently being used. These models frequently find that large booms and busts in asset prices may occur as agents switch across forecasting strategies.&lt;ref name=arthuretal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Brock and C. Hommes (1997), 'A rational route to randomness.' ''Econometrica'' 65 (5), pp. 1059-1095.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Hommes (2008), 'Interacting agents in finance,' in ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics''.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Brock, Hommes, and Wagener (2009) have used a model of this type to argue that the introduction of new hedging instruments may destabilize the market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=W. |last=Brock |first2=C. |last2=Hommes |first3=F. |last3=Wagener |year=2009 |title=More hedging instruments may destabilize markets |journal=Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=1912–1928 |doi=10.1016/j.jedc.2009.05.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some papers have suggested that ACE might be a useful methodology for understanding the recent [[financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;M.

{{Nihongo|'''Android 17'''|人造人間17号|Jinzōningen Jū Nana Gō|lit. "Artificial Human #17"|lead=yes}}, born as '''Lapis''' (ラピス Rapisu) is a fictional character in the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' manga series created by [[Akira Toriyama]]. Android 17 makes his debut in chapter #349 The Androids Awake! (目覚めた17号、18号, Mezameta Jūnanagō, Jūhachigō), first published in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' on November 12, 1991. 

He and his twin sister, [[Android 18]] were forcibly turned into [[cyborg]]s by [[Dr. Gero]] to kill series protagonist [[Goku]]. The present-timeline version of the character has little interest in doing so, only pursuing it as a game. The alternate timeline version is activated after Goku's death, murdering the other characters and having a twenty-year reign of terror on Earth until being killed by [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Future Trunks]]. They serve as the de facto antagonists of the second act of the third volume of the ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)| Dragon Ball]]'' manga, as well as the third season of the anime adaptation ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', only to be supplanted by fellow android [[Cell (Dragon Ball)| Cell]], whose purpose was to physically absorb the twins into himself to fully evolve into his complete form. He later returns in ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' as part of the Tournament of Power storyline. 

== Appearances ==
=== In ''Dragon Ball Z'' ===
Android #17 is activated by Dr. Gero after Gero fails to terminate Goku. #18 is activated a short time after, and the group of androids are discovered by the heroes, Dr. Gero ordering #17 and #18 to terminate them while Android #17 remains passive until killing Gero. After surviving a full power attack from [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]], the androids activate #16&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 14, chapter 156&lt;/ref&gt; and begin a quest to find Goku out of pure entertainment, being confronted by [[Vegeta]] who begins a duel with #18. #17 is content with allowing the pair to combat each other but warns against the other heroes joining in as he would get involved,&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 14, chapter 158&lt;/ref&gt; doing so after Trunks attacks #18 once she breaks Vegeta's arm, #17 easily defeating [[Piccolo]] and [[Tenshinhan]]. [[Krillin]] confronts Android #17 over his intent to kill Goku, trying to talk him out of it and failing.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 14, chapter 160&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing their search, the androids arrive at Goku's home, finding no one there and then journeying to Kame House, where they find several of Goku's friends, Piccolo stepping up to combat them. #17 agrees to the battle and they fight an even match until Cell arrives, able to find the group thanks to the outpouring of power on Piccolo's part. #17 is confused to see the bio android, Piccolo revealing Cell's needing to absorb him and #18 to achieve his perfect form. #17 and Piccolo find themselves overwhelmed by Cell, #16 stepping in and proving to be a match against Cell, though insisting that #17 and #18 leave as the pair decline. Cell sneaks up behind #17, being seen by Tenshinhan from the sky who warns #17 moments before he is absorbed and triggers Cell's transforming into his second form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Say Goodbye, 17|series=''Dragon Ball Z''|number=152|airdate=October 20, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; #17 dies when Cell self-destructs in a failed attempt to destroy the Earth, being resurrected with the Dragon Balls after Cell's defeat along with all of his other victims and having his bomb removed by a wish from Krillin.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z'' manga, volume 19, chapter 223&lt;br&gt;"One More Wish". ''Dragon Ball Z''. Episode 193. July 14, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, #17 is killed a second time when [[Majin Buu]] destroys the Earth, being revived along with all other good people on Earth and donating his energy to Goku's ''Spirit Bomb'' to annihilate Majin Buu.

In the alternate future, #17 and #18 are designed with the intention of killing Goku, who dies before they are released, and are portrayed as ruthless murderers who slaughter Earth's heroes and have a twenty-year reign over Earth. For a time, Gohan and Trunks remain the only ones who can combat the pair in battle, though Gohan is killed by #17, and after this, #17 and #18 are able to defeat Trunks with ease. Once he returns from the past, Trunks confronts the androids and easily defeats the pair, first terminating #18 and doing the same to #17.

In the anime-only sequel, ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'', Dr. Gero and Dr. Myuu create a copy of Android 17 by the name of Hell Fighter 17, who meets up with Android 17 and brainwashes him.

Android 17 appears in multiple ''Dragon Ball Z'' games. In the 2005 game ''Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi'', Android #17 becomes Super 17 and is confronted by Cell, Super 17 showing an interest in killing Goku&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi|developer=Spike|publisher=Bandai Namco Entertainment|date=October 18, 2005|quote='''Super 17:''' I will be the one who destroys Goku. I have no need for any kind of defective product. Now get out of here!}}&lt;/ref&gt;  before being defeated.
In the 2011 game ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Tenkaichi]]'', Androids 17 and 18 fight the player and lose their Dragon Balls and radar after being defeated. In the 2015 game ''[[Dragon Ball Xenoverse]]'', Android 17 is empowered by Towa as part of her plan to erase Trunks from existence, the player causing him to flee. Thanks to this change, Cell is able to absorb 17 and 18 without Trunks interfering. In the 2016 game ''[[Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2]]'', Android 17 charges Cell on after the bio android defeats Piccolo and 16, in turn being knocked out by a hit from Cell that sends him flying into Android 18, the unconscious duo being absorbed simultaneously by Cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2|developer=Dimps|publisher=Bandai Namco Entertainment|date=October 25, 2016|quote='''Android 17:''' You gotta be kidding me!}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the player intervenes in Android #17's fight with Piccolo, Android #17 is found to have been empowered similarly to Cell, and Trunks warns that he must be stripped of the empowerment before Cell arrives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2|developer=Dimps|publisher=Bandai Namco Entertainment|date=October 25, 2016|quote='''Trunks:''' If Cell absorbs 17 in this state, he'll grown terrifyingly strong!}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an alternate ending, Androids 17 and 18 are prevented from killing Gohan by Trunks distorting the timeline and joining his mentor in facing the pair, leading to the androids' deaths.

Android #17 appears in the spin-off manga ''Dragon Ball SD'', being spat out by Cell.

== Creation and conception ==
Androids #17 and 18 were created by Akira Toriyama after his editor at the time, [[Kazuhiko Torishima]], expressed distaste with Androids #19 and #20 shortly after their debut. Torishima complained about the new youthful duo once they were incorporated into the story, resulting in the creation of Cell.&lt;ref name="ST2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Shenlong Times 2 |work=DRAGON BALL 大全集 2: STORY GUIDE |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |page=6 |year=1995| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illustrations"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL　大全集 1 COMPLETE　ILLUSTRATION |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |pages=206–207 |isbn=4-08-782751-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Android #17's brief appearance during the Boo arc was originally [[Lunch (Dragon Ball)|Lunch]], a character not otherwise seen during the second half of the manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dragon Ball Full Color: Majin Boo Arc Volume #06|year=2014}} Toriyama: No.17 during the Genki-Dama scene was actually Lunch in the rough draft.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Toriyama revealed Android #17's real name as Lapis in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Green| first = Scott|title="Dragon Ball" Creator Reveals Android No. 17 and 18's Names|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/05/02/dragon-ball-creator-reveals-android-no-17-and-18s-names|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When introduced Android 17 has shoulder length black hair that is parted in the middle, which he retains throughout ''Dragon Ball Z''. He has a black short-sleeved shirt with a white long sleeved undershirt, an orange bandana, blue jeans, green socks and blue shoes. In ''Dragon Ball GT'', he is shown to retain this appearance but also have acquired a tan jacket. In ''Dragon Ball Super'', Android 17's hairstyle becomes identical to Android 18's save for the parted side being the reverse of hers. His outfit now consists of a white and green shirt with blue jeans, black shoes and a tanned belt. He also wears an orange armband with the word "Ranger" written on it.

== Voice actors ==
[[File:Chuck Huber, 2015 Phoenix Comicon.jpg|thumb|Chuck Huber is Android 17's most well known English voice actor.]]
[[Shigeru Nakahara]] voices Android 17 in all Japanese media.

In the English [[Funimation]] dub, Android 17 is voiced by [[Chuck Huber]]. Huber had previously voiced [[Garlic Jr.]] during the filler arc based around the character, though thought of Android 17 as his biggest role since "nobody liked Garlic Jr. as much as they liked Android 17."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diehardgamefan.com/2013/09/13/evillecon-2013-interview-with-voice-actor-chuck-huber/|title=EvilleCon 2013: Interview with Voice Actor Chuck Huber|first=Crystal|last=Shards|publisher=diehardgamefan.com|date=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huber considered the role his easiest and a "voice actor vacation",&lt;ref name=Templeofgeek.com /&gt; as under the direction of [[Christopher Sabat]] he did not have to put on a voice and was advised to be calmer in his dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Hannatalk interview with Chuck Huber&lt;/ref&gt; Huber personally found the character to be a "giant jerk" though liked Android #17 for the characteristic.&lt;ref name=Templeofgeek.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://templeofgeek.com/temple-of-geek-togcast-episode-39-an-interview-with-chuck-huber/|title=Temple of Geek "ToGCast" Episode 39: An Interview With Chuck Huber|date=November 19, 2015|publisher=Temple of Geek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abilities ==
Thanks to his conversion into a cyborg, Android #17 possesses superhuman strength, speed, durability, stamina, and reflexes.

Similarly to many other characters in ''Dragon Ball'', Android #17 can fly with the use {{nihongo|''Bukū-jutsu''|舞空術||lit. "Air Dance Technique"}}. Android #17 wields the {{nihongo|''Super Electric Strike''|超電圧爆裂斬|Chō Denatsu Bakuretsuzan}}, which involves throwing out his hands to release two arcing electric energy beams after charging them,&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball: Xenoverse''&lt;/ref&gt; {{Nihongo|''Power Blitz''|パワーブリッツ|Pawā Burittsu}}, where Android #17 fires an energy wave from the palm of his hand, and {{Nihongo|''Full Power Energy Ball''|フルパワーエネルギーボール|Furu Pawā Enerugī Bōru}}, #17 firing a single energy sphere that inflicts more damage than a normal one. Melee moves include ''Freedom Kick'', where he kicks an opponent multiple times before stomping on them. Additionally, he possesses the rather unique ability to project barriers. While unnamed in the show, in other media the technique is called the {{Nihongo|''Android Barrier''|アンドロイドバリヤー|Andoroido Bariyā}}. It is a versatile technique whose uses include trapping enemies, protecting oneself from attacks, and even empowering blows with barrier energy.

Android #17 is introduced as one of the strongest characters at the time, easily defeating Piccolo and Tienshinhan. After Piccolo receives an increase in power, Android #17 is evenly-matched with him, and #17 is outclassed by Cell after he absorbs thousands of humans.

== Reception ==
Android 17 has been met with positive reception. In the 2004 ''Dragon Ball Forever'' poll, Android 17 ranked 18th place for most popular character.{{cn|date=February 2018}} Android 17 came in 17th place in Complex.com's list "A Ranking of All the Characters on 'Dragon Ball Z', Pearce citing Android 17's disliking of his cybernetics as making him more interesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2015/04/dragon-ball-z-characters-ranked/king-kai|title=A Ranking of All the Characters on 'Dragon Ball Z'|date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan Scott said Android 17 was his favorite of the androids in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observationdeck.kinja.com/rock-the-dragon-the-worst-to-best-dragon-ball-sagas-1688230051|title=Rock The Dragon!

Reviewer Shawn Saris lamented the lack of attention devoted to his apparent sacrifice in the Tournament of Power: "Due to his massive impact on the tournament, and the fact he is now dead (not simply knocked out of the tournament), more time should’ve been given to appreciate the severity of the moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/12/dragon-ball-super-episode-127-the-approaching-wall-the-final-barrier-of-hope-review|title=Dragon Ball Super Episode 127: "The Approaching Wall!

[[Assisted suicide]] is related to, but distinct from, [[euthanasia]]. Euthanasia is the act of ending the life of another for the purpose of relieving their suffering. Assisted suicide is the ending of one's own life with the assistance of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Euthanasia and assisted suicide |url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/euthanasia-and-assisted-suicide/ |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "assisted dying" is often used instead of assisted suicide by proponents of legalisation and the media when used in the context of a medically assisted suicide for the purpose of relieving suffering. "Assisted dying" is also the phrase used by politicians when bills are proposed in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assisted Dying Bill [HL] 2016-17 |url=https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/assisteddying.html |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Wales==
Section 2 of the [[Suicide Act 1961]], as originally enacted, provided that it was an offence to "aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide of another" and that a person who committed this offence was liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.&lt;ref name=debbie&gt;{{cite news|title=Don't jail my husband if he helps me to die, pleads MS sufferer|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/dont-jail-my-husband-if-he-helps-me-to-die-pleads-ms-sufferer-927090.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; That section has amended by the [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]].

Two factors which point towards a prosecution not being in the public interest are that the victim had reached a voluntary, clear, settled and informed decision to commit suicide; and that the suspect was wholly motivated by compassion.&lt;ref name="cps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/assisted_suicide_policy.html|title=The CPS : Assisted Suicide Policy|publisher=cps.gov.uk|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempts at reform===
There have been various attempts to introduce legislation to change the legal situation regarding assisted suicide in the United Kingdom.

In 1931 Dr C. Killick Millard, the President of the [[Society of Medical Officers of Health]], proposed a Voluntary Euthanasia (Legislation) Bill for incurable invalids.&lt;ref name=DMirror31&gt;''Daily Mirror'' 17 October 1931, p2 "Doctor's Plea for the Right to Easy Death"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, [[Berkeley Moynihan, 1st Baron Moynihan|Lord Moynihan]] and  [[Killick Millard|Dr Killick Millard]] founded the British Voluntary Euthanasia Society (later known as EXIT and now as [[Dignity in Dying]]). The first attempt to reform the law in England was in 1936 by Lord [[Arthur Ponsonby]] and supported by the Euthanasia Society. 

The British Voluntary Euthanasia Society produced ''A Guide To Self Deliverance''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Publication was delayed amid controversy because of the Suicide Act of 1961 which states that the legal system can allow up to 14 years in prison for anyone that assists in a suicide. Therefore, it was unclear whether the Society could be held accountable for assisting in suicide because of its [[publication]].&lt;ref name="mcd"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, a Bill was introduced into the House of Lords by Lord Raglan. In 1970, the House of Commons debated the issue. Baroness Wootton introduced a Bill to the Lords in 1976 on the matter of "passive euthanasia".&lt;ref&gt;Foreword by the Earl of Listowel to ''Voluntary Euthanasia: Experts Debate the Right to Die'' eds. A. B. Downing and [[Barbara Smoker]], {{ISBN|0-7206-0651-9}}, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 1997, a vote was taken in the House of Commons on the issue of introducing a Doctor Assisted Dying Bill, proposed by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Joe Ashton]]. The bill was defeated by 234 votes to 89.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commons Hansard Debates text for  Wednesday 10 Dec 1997 |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo971210/debtext/71210-25.htm#71210-25_head0 |accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2003 and 2006, Labour peer [[Joel Joffe, Baron Joffe|Lord Joffe]] made four attempts to introduce bills that would have legalized assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia - all were rejected by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/euthanasia/overview/asstdyingbill_1.shtml |title=Assisted Dying Bill - latest |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the [[British Medical Journal]] published an editorial arguing that medical organisations like the [[British Medical Association]] ought to drop their opposition to assisted dying and take a neutral stance so as to enable Parliament to debate the issue and not have what [[Raymond Tallis]] described as a "disproportionate influence on the decision".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Neutrality' call on assisted dying|url=http://www.birminghammail.net/news/national-news/2012/06/14/neutrality-call-on-assisted-dying-97319-31180290/|newspaper=Birmingham Post|date=14 June 2012|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Labour peer [[Lord Falconer]] introduced an Assisted Dying Bill into the House of Lords. The bill proposed that terminally ill patients with a life expectancy of less than six months be given the option of a medically assisted death, subject to legal safeguards. The bill reached committee stage before running out of time in the session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assisted Dying Bill [HL] 2014-15 |url=https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2014-15/assisteddying.html |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Labour MP [[Rob Marris]] introduced an Assisted Dying Bill based on Lord Falconer's proposals the year before. The bill was defeated by 118 votes to 330 on 11 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Assisted Dying Bill: MPs reject 'right to die' law |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34208624 |accessdate=5 August 2018 |agency=BBC |date=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Conservative peer [[Robert Hayward, Baron Hayward|Lord Hayward]] reintroduced the Assisted Dying Bill into the Lords. The bill did not get past the first reading due to the parliamentary session ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assisted Dying Bill [HL] 2016-17 |url=https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/assisteddying.html |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The question for politicians in Britain today is why do you force your citizens, people in the most terrible circumstances who are determined to end their suffering in a way of their own choosing, to leave their country and travel to Switzerland to exercise their free will?&lt;ref name="mcd"/&gt;}}

==Scotland==

Assisted dying in [[Scots law]] might constitute murder, [[culpable homicide]] or no offence depending on the nature of the assistance. In 1980, the Scottish branch of the British Voluntary Euthanasia Society (now called [[Exit (Right-to-Die Organisation)|Exit]]) broke off from its original society in order to publish ''How to Die with Dignity'',&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Die with Dignity|author1=Mair, G.B.|author2=Scottish Exit (Edinburgh, Scotland)|date=1980|publisher=Scottish Exit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQZ5NAAACAAJ|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became the first publication of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name="mcd"/&gt;

In a 2012 consultation on the Member's Bill proposed by MSP [[Margo MacDonald]], 64% of the members of the public who choose to give comment on the issue rejected the proposals. A similar consultation by the Health and Sport Committee in 2014 came to a different conclusion, with 78% of responses by individuals being supportive of the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assisted Suicide (Scotland) Bill |url=http://www.parliament.scot/ResearchBriefingsAndFactsheets/S4/SB_15-02_Assisted_Suicide_Scotland_Bill.pdf |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 2015 a majority of MSPs including the first minister [[Alex Salmond]] voted against the bill in the [[Scottish Parliament]], defeating it in its first stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MSPs reject Assisted Suicide Scotland Bill |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32887408 |website=BBC |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crown dependencies and overseas territories==

===Jersey===

In October 2018, in response to a petition, Jersey's Health Minister called on the laws banning assisted dying to be reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assisted dying petition: Minister calls for law review |url=https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2018/10/03/assisted-dying-petition-minister-calls-for-law-review/ |website=Jersey Evening Post |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guernsey===

In May 2018, a vote was taken on the issue in Guernsey. The proposals would have allowed those with six months or less to live access to assisted dying. The vote was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guernsey parliament votes against assisted dying |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/18/guernsey-parliament-votes-against-assisted-dying |website=The Guardian |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falkland Islands===

In July 2018 the Falkland Islands voted, in principle, to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill, subject to safeguards. They are the first British overseas territory to do so. In addition they voted to consider changing the law on assisted dying if the UK did the same. Whilst the vote did not change the law, campaigners saw it as a vote of support for legalisation in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Falkland Islands become first overseas British territory to vote in support of assisted dying |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/falkland-islands-becomes-first-overseas-12987568 |website=Mirror |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal challenges==

There have been multiple challenges to the blanket ban on assisted suicide by people wanting a medically assisted suicide, both by patients with and without a terminal illness.

In 2001, [[motor neurone disease]] sufferer [[Diane Pretty]] took her case to the House of Lords, for the right to allow her husband to assist legally in her suicide. The case was dismissed by them, and also subsequently by the European Court of Human Rights in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Diane Pretty dies |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1983457.stm |website=BBC |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[multiple sclerosis]] sufferer [[Debbie Purdy]] took her case to the House of Lords for clarification on whether her husband would face prosecution on returning from Switzerland, should he help her to travel there for an assisted death. She won, and the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]] clarified the likelihood of prosecution in this instance in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Debbie Purdy wins 'significant legal victory' on assisted suicide |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/jul/30/debbie-purdy-assisted-suicide-legal-victory |website=The Guardian |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 a man with [[locked-in syndrome]], [[Tony Nicklinson]], applied to the High Court for the right for a medically assisted death. His case was rejected and he decided to end his life via [[starvation]] shortly afterwards. His wife ultimately took his case to the Supreme Court, in [[R (Nicklinson) v Ministry of Justice]], where it was rejected in 2014. The judges did rule however that they have the authority to declare the parliamentary blanket ban on assisted suicide to be incompatible with human rights law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Supreme Court rejects right to die bid but challenges Parliament to review law |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10924554/Supreme-Court-rejects-right-to-die-bid-but-challenges-Parliament-to-review-law.html |website=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]] further clarified the likelihood of prosecution against medical professionals. Previously, they were more likely to face assisted suicide prosecution due to their role as care givers. The DPP clarified that only those medical professionals directly involved in providing care to the concerned patient would be more likely to face prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assisted suicide guidelines relaxed by Director of Public Prosecutions |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/11168519/Assisted-suicide-guidelines-relaxed-by-Director-of-Public-Prosecutions.html |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that the clarification was made at the request of the Supreme Court. In 2015, the clarification was subsequently challenged in the High Court, where is was argued that the DPP was making laws as opposed to applying them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assisted suicide guidelines challenged in High Court |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/assisted-dying/11568091/Assisted-suicide-guidelines-challenged-in-High-Court.html |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court rejected the challenge against the DPP's clarifications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=High Court allows DPP change in assisted suicide law that makes prosecuting healthcare professionals unlikely |url=https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/2882/high-court-allows-dpp-change-in-assisted-suicide-law-that-makes-prosecuting-healthcare-professionals-unlikely |website=The Tablet |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Court of Appeal subsequently denied a request to challenge the High Court's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Campaigners fail in High Court challenge over change to assisted dying policy |url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/national/article/Campaigners-fail-in-High-Court-challenge-over-change-to-assisted-dying-policy-75d46170-47d3-49e8-94fe-aa8e8a337c19-ds |website=News &amp; Star |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, retired lecturer [[Noel Conway (Lecturer)|Noel Conway]] brought his case to the High Court for the right for a medically assisted death. He has motor neurone disease and is terminally ill. His case was dismissed by the High Court, by the Court of Appeal in 2018, and ultimately by the Supreme Court at the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Terminally ill Noel Conway loses challenge to assisted dying ban |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/27/assisted-dying-uk-court-rejects-noel-conway-challenge |website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conwaysc"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2017, a man known as "Omid T" with [[multiple system atrophy]] brought a case to the High Court for the right to a medically assisted death. His case is different from Noel Conway's in that he is not terminally ill. His case is currently in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Incurably-ill man’s assisted dying case reaches latest High Court stage |url=https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2018/03/07/incurably-ill-mans-assisted-dying-case-reaches-latest-high-court-stage/ |website=Shropshire Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2018 Omid ended his life in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assisted dying campaigner ends life in Switzerland |url=https://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/national/16962057.assisted-dying-campaigner-ends-life-in-switzerland/ |website=Lancashire Telegraph |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion polls==

A 2015 [[Populus Ltd|Populus]] poll found broad public support for the introduction of assisted dying laws in the United Kingdom. 82% of people supported it, including 86% of people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dignity in Dying Poll - Populous |url=https://www.populus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DIGNITY-IN-DYING-Populus-poll-March-2015-data-tables-with-full-party-crossbreaks.compressed.pdf |accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another poll showed that 54% of British General Practitioners are either supportive or neutral towards the introduction of assisted dying laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Opinion - Dignity in Dying |url=https://www.dignityindying.org.uk/assisted-dying/public-opinion/ |accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar 2017 poll on [[Doctors.net.uk]] published in the [[British Medical Journal|BMJ]] said that 55% of doctors would support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Assisted dying case ‘stronger than ever’ with majority of doctors now in support |url=https://inews.co.uk/news/health/assisted-dying-debate-bmj-doctors-majority-support/ |accessdate=4 August 2018 |date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast the [[British Medical Association|BMA]], which represents doctors in the UK, opposes it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Physician-assisted dying - BMA |url=https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/ethics/ethics-a-to-z/physician-assisted-dying}}&lt;/ref&gt; although from June 2005 to June 2006 they took a neutral position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Doctors' leaders drop opposition to euthanasia |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/jun/30/health.politics |website=The Guardian |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Doctors change euthanasia stance |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5123974.stm |website=BBC |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noel Conway===

Noel Conway is a retired lecturer from [[Shrewsbury]], England. In 2014, he was diagnosed with [[motor neurone disease]] and wants the right to an assisted death.

[[Assisted suicide]] is currently illegal in the United Kingdom, and doctors found to be assisting a suicide can be jailed for up to 14 years, under the [[Suicide Act 1961]]. Mr Conway challenged this law in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in 2017 on the grounds of human rights, claiming that the law against assisted suicide in the United Kingdom interferes with his "right to respect for private and family life"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_8_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights#Right |title=Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;, protected under [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]. His case was supported by [[Dignity in Dying]]. On 5 October 2017 the High Court ruled against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Noel Conway: Terminally ill man loses right-to-die case |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-41506155 |website=BBC |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr Conway subsequently took his case to the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]], which was heard in May 2018. Three judges rejected his case on 27 June 2018. The court stated that parliament is better placed to rule on the issue and concerns were raised over whether the safeguards proposed by Mr Conway were adequate to protect vulnerable people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Noel Conway: Terminally-ill man loses assisted dying challenge |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-44628459 |website=BBC |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the decision in the Court of Appeal, Mr Conway announced his intention to take his case to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]]. This was the first time since 2014 the Supreme Court has considered a case of assisted dying, when they reviewed the case of Tony Nicklinson posthumously. Although Mr Nicklinson's case was ultimately rejected, some statements by the Justices were seen as positive by assisted dying campaigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Supreme Court rejects right to die bid but challenges Parliament to review law |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10924554/Supreme-Court-rejects-right-to-die-bid-but-challenges-Parliament-to-review-law.html |website=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 27 November 2018 the Supreme Court rejected the possibility of a full hearing for Mr Conway's case.&lt;ref name="conwaysc"&gt;{{cite news |title=Supreme court rejects request for right-to-die case to be heard |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/27/uk-supreme-court-rejects-right-to-die-case-hearing-noel-conway |accessdate=27 November 2018 |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organisations===

In addition, the following organisations advocate legalising assisted dying or euthanasia:

Barilko was of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] descent and had a brother, Alex, and sister, Anne.&lt;ref name=ts42011&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.torontosun.com/2011/04/20/the-legend-of-bill-barilko | title = The legend of Bill Barilko | last = Hornby | first = Lance |date = April 20, 2011 | work = [[The Toronto Sun]] | accessdate = April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
In February 1947, Bill Barilko was called up to the Toronto Maple Leafs from the [[PCHL]]'s Hollywood Wolves and played for Toronto until his death.&lt;ref name="Maple Leafs history 40s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;id=12737 |title=Maple Leafs History: 1940s |publisher=[[Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment]] |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818022838/http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;id=12737 |archivedate=2007-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned [[hockey jersey|sweater]] #21 when he debuted for the Leafs. He changed to #19 for the 1948-49 and 1949-50 seasons. The #5 (which was retired by the Leafs) was worn by Barilko for only one season, 1950-51. During that span of five seasons, Barilko and the Toronto Maple Leafs were [[Stanley Cup]] champions on four occasions: 1947, 1948, 1949, 1951.&lt;ref name="Maple Leafs history 50s"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;id=12738 |title=Maple Leafs History: 1950s |publisher=[[Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment]] |accessdate=2007-08-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818021902/http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;id=12738 |archivedate=18 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last goal scored by Barilko was in overtime against the Montreal Canadiens' netminder [[Gerry McNeil]]. This goal, in Game 5 of the [[1951 Stanley Cup Final]] (April 21, 1951) won the Leafs the Cup.&lt;ref name="Maple Leaf bio" /&gt;

==Disappearance and death==
On August 26, 1951, Barilko joined his [[dentist]], Henry Hudson, on a flight aboard Hudson's [[Fairchild 24]] floatplane to [[Rupert House]] in northern Quebec for a weekend fishing trip.&lt;ref name="Leafs pay tribute"&gt;{{cite news|title=Leafs pay tribute to Barilko |publisher=[[CBC Sports]] |date=2001-05-01 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/leafs-pay-tribute-to-barilko-1.278317 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070913012320/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/05/01/barilko010501.html |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no |accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="11year"&gt;{{cite news |title=The 11-year mystery of Leafs' 'Bashin' Bill Barilko' |url=https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/once-upon-a-city-archives/2017/06/01/the-11-year-mystery-of-leafs-bashin-bill-barilko.html |first=Carola |last=Vyhna |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=July 1, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the return trip to [[Porcupine Lake (Ontario)|Porcupine Lake]], the single-engine plane disappeared and its passengers remained missing.&lt;ref name="Leafs pay tribute" /&gt;&lt;ref name="plane home"&gt;{{cite news |title=Barilko's plane finally arrives home |url=http://www.lfpress.com/sports/hockey/2011/10/20/18855171.html |first=Ken |last=Pagan |newspaper=London Free Press |date=October 20, 2011 |accessdate=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven years later, on June 6, 1962, helicopter pilot Ron Boyd discovered the wreckage of the plane&lt;ref&gt;Victims of Aviation Accidents or Incidents in Canada: Cal Jones, Billy Joe Booth, Jonathan Mann, Brice Herbert Goldsborough, Bill Barilko, {{ISBN|978-1-155-40830-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; about {{convert|100|km|mi}} north of [[Cochrane, Ontario]],&lt;ref name="The Sporting News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_23_223/ai_54868463 |title=Bashin' Bill |publisher=[[The Sporting News]] |date=1999-06-07 |accessdate=2007-08-01 | first=Todd | last=Fitzpatrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uwo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/1999/May/28/Sports3.htm |title=Millennium Moment: Fifty Mission Cap |publisher=[[University of Western Ontario]] Gazette |date=1999-05-28 |accessdate=2007-08-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912071955/http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/1999/May/28/Sports3.htm |archivedate=12 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; about 56 kilometres (35 miles) off course.

Barilko is buried in [[Timmins, Ontario|Timmins]], Ontario, Canada, at the Timmins Memorial Cemetery.

=="Fifty Mission Cap"==
The 1992 song "[[Fifty Mission Cap]]" by [[The Tragically Hip]] is about Barilko's death and the Leafs' subsequent Stanley Cup drought.&lt;ref name="Leafs pay tribute" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uwo" /&gt; The song has been credited as singlehandedly reviving Barilko's fame after he had lapsed into semi-obscurity;&lt;ref name=remembered&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/2017/10/18/the-late-gord-downie-helped-us-remember-bill-barilko "The late Gord Downie helped us remember Bill Barilko"]. ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', October 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the song remains a staple part of the Leafs' warm-up playlist at every home game, and the Leafs have a framed, handwritten copy of [[Gord Downie]]'s lyrics to the song in their private players' lounge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/2017/10/18/leafs-mourn-inspiration-downie.html "Leafs mourn ‘huge inspiration’ Downie"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', October 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever the band played the [[Air Canada Centre]], Barilko's retired-number banner was always left in place during the concert,&lt;ref name=remembered/&gt; and when Downie died on October 17, 2017, the team incorporated Barilko's banner into its Downie tribute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailyhive.com/toronto/maple-leafs-gord-downie-tribute-bill-barilko "Maple Leafs honour Gord Downie with unique 50 Mission Cap tribute"]. ''Daily Hive'', October 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Barilko played in the [[1st National Hockey League All-Star Game|1947]], [[2nd National Hockey League All-Star Game|1948]] and [[3rd National Hockey League All-Star Game|1949]] [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]], scoring a goal in the 1949 game.

Barilko won four [[Stanley Cup]]s with the Maple Leafs in 1947, 1948, 1949, and 1951.

Until October 15, 2016, Barilko's #5 was one of only two numbers retired by the Maple Leafs ([[Ace Bailey]]'s #6 was the other).&lt;ref name="Maple Leaf bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leafs pay tribute" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Sporting News" /&gt;

Barilko's story was published in the 1988 book ''Overtime, Overdue: The Bill Barilko Story'', by John Melady, and the 2004 book ''Barilko — Without A Trace'', by Kevin Shea.

In 2017, [[The Sports Network|TSN]] aired the short documentary film ''The Mission'', profiling a project to recover the remaining wreckage of Barilko's plane; the film took its title from "Fifty Mission Cap", and it thematically touched on the song's role in Barilko's story.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/video/tsn-original-the-mission~1041346 "TSN Original: The Mission"]. [[The Sports Network]].&lt;/ref&gt; The film received a [[Canadian Screen Award]] nomination for Best Sports Feature Segment at the [[6th Canadian Screen Awards]] in 2018.

'''Brit Rechitzah''' (covenant of washing) is an alternative ceremony to [[Brit milah]] performed by progressive Jews who are opposed to circumcision as a blood ritual. It is often a part of the liturgy of ceremonies such as ''[[Brit shalom (naming ceremony)|brit shalom]]'' ('covenant of peace') or ''brit b'lee milah'' ('covenant without cutting'). Those who perform it include [[rabbi]]s in the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], [[Jewish Renewal|Renewal]], and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] movements of [[Judaism]].

Rechitzah involves the washing of the baby's feet and has its origins in an account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] where [[Abraham]] washes the feet of angels who appear as strangers to visit him. This is thought of as a way of welcoming a Jewish boy into the faith in a peaceful way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jweekly.com/resource/brit-shalom-celebrant-list/ |title=Brit Shalom Celebrant List |last=Reiss |first=Mark David, M.D. |date=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=www.jweekly.com |publisher=J. The Jewish News of Northern California |access-date=19 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moshe Rothenberg has developed Jewish liturgy that includes Rechitzah and has popularized this Jewish welcoming ritual.&lt;ref name="circumstitions"&gt;{{cite web | title = Brit Shalom Celebrants | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141213065752/http://www.circumstitions.com/Jewish-shalom.html | archive-date = 13 December 2014 | url = http://www.circumstitions.com/Jewish-shalom.html | website = circumstitions.com }} Rabbis and other Jewish Celebrants who perform Rechitzah.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
Professor Michael S. Kimmel's account of Rechitzah at his son's ''brit shalom'' ceremony:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Then it was the moment for which we had all carefully prepared, about which we had endlessly talked, debated, argued, discussed. We took a pitcher of water and a bowl to the door of the house. Amy and I carried Zachary over to the threshold. With one hand I held his little body and with the other held his tiny legs over the bowl. Amy poured some water over his feet and rubbed it in. Then she held him and I did the same. Throughout, the mohel chanted in prayer. And in that way, we welcomed Zachary into our home and into our lives."&lt;ref name="Kimmel"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kimmel | first = Michael S. | author-link = Michael Kimmel | title = The kindest un-cut: feminism, Judaism, and my son's foreskin | journal = [[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]] | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 43–48 | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] | date = May–June 2001 | url = http://www.tikkun.org/article.php/may2001_kimmel | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We welcomed Zachary into our family on that morning without a circumcision. We decided that we want him to live in a world without violence, so we welcomed him without violence. We decided that we want him to live in a world in which he is free to experience the fullness of the pleasures of his body, so we welcomed him with all his fleshy nerves intact. And we decided that we want him to live in a world in which [[male entitlement]] is a waning memory, and in which women and men are seen--in both ritual and in reality--as full equals and partners. So we welcomed him equally, his mother and I, in the time-honored way that desert cultures have always welcomed strangers to their tents: We washed his feet."&lt;ref name="Kimmel" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Captain D'Agoust''' was an officer of the [[Swiss Guards]], described by [[Thomas Carlyle]] in his [[The French Revolution, A History|classic recounting]] of the [[French Revolution]], as a "cast-iron" individual. On 4 May 1788, fourteen months before the Revolution, the captain, acting on the order of the [[Court of Versailles]], marched the [[Parliament of Paris]] out of the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palais de Justice]] and removed the key from the premises. The event is considered one of the key mileposts on the road to the Revolution.

==Prokaryotes and fungi==
[[File:Penicillium notatum.jpg|thumb|The fungus [[Penicillium chrysogenum]]. It produces [[penicillin]], a compound which kills bacteria.|alt=|left]]
Bacteria of the genera ''[[Chromobacterium]]'', ''[[Janthinobacterium]]'', and ''[[Pseudoalteromonas]]'' produce a toxic secondary metabolite, [[violacein]], to deter protozoan predation. Violacein is released when bacteria are consumed, killing the protozoan. Another bacteria, ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', aggregates into [[quorum sensing]] biofilms which may aid the coordinated release of toxins to protect against predation by protozoans. Flagellates were allowed to grow and were present in a biofilm of ''P. aeruginosa'' grown for three days, but no flagellates were detected after seven days. This suggests that concentrated and coordinated release of extracellular toxins by biofilms has a greater effect than unicellular excretions.&lt;ref&gt;Matz, C., &amp; Kjelleberg, S. (2005). Off the hook—how bacteria survive protozoan grazing. Trends in microbiology, 13(7), 302–307. {{doi|10.1016/j.tim.2005.05.009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial growth is inhibited not only by bacterial toxins, but also by secondary metabolites produced by fungi as well.&lt;ref name=Keller2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=gloer/&gt; The most well-known of these, first discovered and published by Alexander Fleming in 1929, described the antibacterial properties of a "mould juice" isolated from ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum|Penicillium notatum]]''. He named the substance penicillin, and it became the world's first broad-spectrum antibiotic.&lt;ref name=Keller2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, A. (1929). On the antibacterial action of cultures of a penicillium, with special reference to their use in the isolation of B. influenzae. British journal of experimental pathology, 10(3), 226. {{pmc|2048009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many fungi are either pathogenic [[Saprotroph|saprophytic]], or live within plants without harming them as [[endophyte]]s, and many of these have been documented to produce chemicals with antagonistic effects against a variety of organisms, including fungi, bacteria, and protozoa.&lt;ref name=Keller2005/&gt; Studies of [[coprophilous fungi]] have found antifungal agents which reduce the fitness of competing fungi.&lt;ref name=gloer/&gt; In addition, [[Sclerotium|sclerotia]] of ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' contained a number of previously unknown [[Aflavinine|aflavinines]] which were much more effective at reducing predation by the fungivorous beetle, ''[[Carpophilus hemipterus]]'', than [[Aflatoxin|aflatoxins]] which ''A. flavus'' also produced and it has been hypothesized that ergot alkaloids, [[Mycotoxin|mycotoxins]] produced by ''[[Claviceps purpurea]]'', may have evolved to discourage herbivory of the host plant.&lt;ref name=gloer/&gt;

{{Main|Plant_defense_against_herbivory#Chemical_defenses}}

A wealth of literature exists on the defensive chemistry of secondary metabolites produced by terrestrial plants and their antagonistic effects on pests and pathogens, likely owing to the fact that human society depends upon large-scale agricultural production to sustain global commerce. Since the 1950s, over 200,000 secondary metabolites have been documented in plants.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, T. (2007). From waste products to ecochemicals: fifty years research of plant secondary metabolism. Phytochemistry, 68(22), 2831–2846. {{doi|10.1016/j.phytochem.2007.09.017}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds serve a variety of physiological and allelochemical purposes, and provide a sufficient stock for the evolution of defensive chemicals. Examples of common secondary metabolites used as chemical defenses by plants include [[alkaloids]], [[phenols]], and [[terpenes]].&lt;ref&gt;Levin, D. A. (1976). The chemical defenses of plants to pathogens and herbivores. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 7(1), 121–159. {{doi|10.1146/annurev.es.07.110176.001005}}. {{JSTOR|2096863}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Defensive chemicals used to avoid consumption may be broadly characterized as either toxins or substances reducing the digestive capacity of herbivores. Although toxins are defined in a broad sense as any substance produced by an organism that reduces the fitness of another, in a more specific sense toxins are substances which directly affect and diminish the functioning of certain metabolic pathways.&lt;ref&gt;Wittstock, U., &amp; Gershenzon, J. (2002). Constitutive plant toxins and their role in defense against herbivores and pathogens. Current opinion in plant biology, 5(4), 300–307. {{doi|10.1016/S1369-5266(02)00264-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Patterns&gt;Cates, R. G., &amp; Rhoades, D. F. (1977). Patterns in the production of antiherbivore chemical defenses in plant communities. Biochemical Systematics and Ecology, 5(3), 185–193. {{doi|10.1016/0305-1978(77)90003-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Toxins are minor constituents (&lt;2% dry weight), active in small concentrations, and more present in flowers and young leaves. On the other hand, indigestible compounds make up to 60% dry weight of tissue and are predominately found in mature, woody species.&lt;ref name=Patterns/&gt; Many alkaloids, pyrethrins, and phenols are toxins. Tannins are major inhibitors of digestion and are polyphenolic compounds with large molecular weights. Lignin and cellulose are important structural elements in plants and are also usually highly indigestible. Tannins are also toxic against pathogenic fungi at natural concentrations in a variety of woody tissues.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum1995 /&gt; Not only useful as deterrents to pathogens or consumers, some of the chemicals produced by plants are effective in inhibiting competitors as well. Two separate shrub communities in the California chapparal were found to produce phenolic compounds and volatile terpenes which accumulated in soil and prevented various herbs from growing near the shrubs. Other plants were only observed to grow when fire removed shrubs, but herbs subsequently died off after shrubs returned.&lt;ref name=allelochemics/&gt; Although the focus has been on broad-scale patterns in terrestrial plants, Paul and Fenical in 1986 demonstrated a variety of secondary metabolites in marine algae which prevented feeding or induced mortality in bacteria, fungi, echinoderms, fishes, and gastropods.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, V. J., &amp; Fenical, W. (1986). Chemical defense in tropical green algae, order Caulerpales. Marine Ecology Progress Series, 157–169. {{JSTOR|24824962}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In nature, pests are a severe problem to plant communities as well, leading to the co-evolution of plant chemical defenses and herbivore metabolic strategies to detoxify their plant food.&lt;ref name="Fhagg2014"&gt;Fürstenberg-Hägg, J., Zagrobelny, M., Jørgensen, K., Vogel, H., &amp; Møller, B. L. (2014). Chemical Defense Balanced by Sequestration and De Novo. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0108745}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of invertebrates consume plants, but insects have received a majority of the attention. Insects are pervasive agricultural pests and sometimes occur in such high densities that they can strip fields of crops.&lt;ref&gt;Lomer, C. J., Bateman, R. P., Johnson, D. L., Langewald, J., &amp; Thomas, M. (2001). Biological control of locusts and grasshoppers. Annual Review of Entomology, 46(1), 667–702. {{doi|10.1146/annurev.ento.46.1.667}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many insects are distasteful to predators and excrete irritants or secrete poisonous compounds that cause illness or death when ingested. Secondary metabolites obtained from plant food may also be sequestered by insects and used in the production of their own toxins.&lt;ref name=Fhagg2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=BEETLE&gt;Dettner, K. (1987). Chemosystematics and evolution of beetle chemical defenses. Annual Review of Entomology, 32(1), 17–48. {{doi|10.1146/annurev.en.32.010187.000313}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more well-known examples of this is the [[monarch butterfly]], which sequesters poison obtained from the [[Asclepias|miilkweed]] plant. Among the most successful insect orders employing this strategy are beetles ([[Coleoptera]]), grasshoppers ([[Orthoptera]]), and moths and butterflies ([[Lepidoptera]]).&lt;ref name=Insects&gt;Schmidt, J.

Anatomical structures have developed to store these substances, and some are circulated in the hemolyph and released associated with a behavior called [[Autohaemorrhaging|reflex bleeding]].&lt;ref name=BEETLE/&gt;

=== Vertebrates ===

'''Constantius II''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Julius Constantius Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Constantius' name would be inscribed as FLAVIVS IVLIVS CONSTANTIVS AVGVSTVS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CIL 06, 40776 = AE 1934, 00158 = AE 1950, 00174 = AE 1951, 00102 = AE 1982, 00011&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc-gre|Κωνστάντιος}}; 7 August 317 – 3 November 361) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 337 to 361. His reign saw constant warfare on the borders against the [[Sasanian Empire]] and [[Germanic peoples]], while internally the [[Roman Empire]] went through repeated civil wars and usurpations, culminating in Constantius' overthrow as emperor by his cousin [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]. His religious policies inflamed domestic conflicts that would continue after his death.

The second son of [[Constantine I]] and [[Fausta]], Constantius was made ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' by his father in 324. He led the [[Late Roman army|Roman army]] in [[Persian wars of Constantius II|war]] against the Sasanian Empire in 336. A year later, Constantine I died, and Constantius became ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]'' with his brothers [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] and [[Constans]]. He promptly oversaw the massacre of eight of his relatives, consolidating his hold on power. The brothers divided the empire among themselves, with Constantius receiving the eastern provinces. In 340, his brothers Constantine and Constans clashed over the western provinces of the empire. The resulting conflict left Constantine dead and Constans as ruler of the west. The war against the Sasanians continued, with Constantius losing a major [[Siege of Singara|battle]] at [[Singara]] in 344. In 350, Constans was overthrown and assassinated in 350 by the [[usurper]] [[Magnentius]]. 

Unwilling to accept Magnentius as co-ruler, Constantius waged a [[Roman civil war of 350–353|civil war]] against the usurper, defeating him at the battles of [[Battle of Mursa Major|Mursa Major]] in 351 and [[Battle of Mons Seleucus|Mons Seleucus]] in 353. Magnentius committed suicide after the latter battle, leaving Constantius as sole ruler of the empire. In 351, Constantius elevated his cousin [[Constantius Gallus]] to the subordinate rank of ''Caesar'' to rule in the east, but had him executed three years later after receiving scathing reports of his violent and corrupt nature. Shortly thereafter, in 355, Constantius promoted his last surviving cousin, Gallus' younger half-brother Julian, to the rank of ''Caesar''.

As emperor, Constantius promoted [[Arianism|Arian Christianity]], [[Anti-paganism policy of Constantius II|persecuted]] [[Paganism|pagan]]s by banning sacrifices and closing pagan temples and issued laws discriminating against [[Jews]]. His military campaigns against Germanic tribes were successful: he defeated the [[Alamanni]] in 354 and campaigned across the [[Danube]] against the [[Quadi]] and [[Sarmatians]] in 357. The war against the Sasanians, which had been in a lull since 350, erupted with renewed intensity in 359 and Constantius traveled to the east in 360 to restore stability after the loss of several border fortresses to the Sasanians. However, Julian claimed the rank of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] in 360, leading to war between the two after Constantius' attempts to convince Julian to back down failed. No battle was fought, as Constantius became ill and died of fever on 3 November 361 in [[Mopsuestia]], naming Julian as his rightful successor before his death.

Constantius was born in 317 at [[Sirmium]], [[Pannonia]]. He was the third son of [[Constantine the Great]], and second by his second wife [[Fausta]], the daughter of [[Maximian]]. Constantius was made [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] by his father on 13 November 324.&lt;ref&gt;DiMaio Jr., M. &amp; Frakes, R. 'DIR-Constantius II' from De Imperatoribus Romanis [http://www.roman-emperors.org/constaii.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 336, religious unrest in [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] and tense relations between Constantine and king [[Shapur II]] caused war to break out between Rome and [[Sassanid Persia]].&lt;ref name="Dodgeon, M.H p152-153"&gt;Dodgeon, M.H. and Lieu, N.C. ''The Roman Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars, AD 226–363''. p152-153&lt;/ref&gt; Though he made initial preparations for the war, Constantine fell ill and sent Constantius east to take command of the eastern frontier.&lt;ref name="Dodgeon, M.H p152-153"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''Orationes'' I, 13B&lt;/ref&gt; Before Constantius arrived, the Persian general Narses, who was possibly the king's brother, overran [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]] and captured [[Diyarbakir|Amida]]. Constantius promptly attacked Narses, and after suffering minor setbacks defeated and killed Narses at the Battle of Narasara.&lt;ref&gt;Festus, ''breviarum'' 27, p. 67, 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius captured Amida and initiated a major refortification of the city, enhancing the city's circuit walls and constructing large towers. He also built a new stronghold in the hinterland nearby, naming it ''Antinopolis''.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus XVIII, 9, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Augustus in the East==
In early 337, Constantius hurried to [[Constantinople]] after receiving news that his father was near death.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicon Paschale'' p.533, 5–17&lt;/ref&gt; After Constantine died, Constantius buried him  with lavish ceremony in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''or''. I, 18D-19A (14.16–22, pp. 31–2, Bidez)&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after his father's death Constantius supposedly ordered a massacre of his relatives descended from the second marriage of his paternal grandfather [[Constantius Chlorus]], though the details are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;X. Lucien-Brun, "Constance II et le massacre des princes," ''Bulletin de l'[[Association Guillaume Budé]]'' ser. 4 (1973): 585–602; Joe W. Leedom, "Constantius II: Three Revisions," ''Byzantion'' 48 (1978): 132–145, and Michael DiMaio and Duane Arnold, "Per Vim, Per Caedem, Per Bellum: A Study of Murder and Ecclesiastical Politics in the Year 337 A.D," ''Byzantion'', 62(1992), 158ff. Cited in DiMaio and Frakes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Zosimus]], ''New History'' II.57-8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], writing between 350 and 370, states that Constantius merely sanctioned “''the act, rather than commanding it''”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Historiae Romanae Breviarium'' X.9&lt;/ref&gt; The massacre killed two of Constantius' uncles and six of his cousins,&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''epistula ad Athenienses'' 270C (3.5–8, p. 215, Bidez)&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Hannibalianus]] and [[Dalmatius]], rulers of [[Diocese of Pontus|Pontus]] and [[Diocese of Moesia|Moesia]] respectively. The massacre left Constantius, his older brother [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], his younger brother [[Constans]], and three cousins [[Constantius Gallus|Gallus]], [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] and [[Nepotianus]] as the only surviving male relatives of Constantine the Great.

Soon after, Constantius met his brothers in [[Pannonia]] at [[Sirmium]] to formalize the partition of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Odahl, C.M., ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'' (2004), p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius received the eastern provinces, including Constantinople, [[Roman Thrace|Thrace]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Cyrenaica]]; Constantine received [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], [[Hispania]], and [[Mauretania Tingitana|Mauretania]]; and Constans, initially under the supervision of Constantine II, received [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italy]], [[Africa Province|Africa]], [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], [[Pannonia]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], and [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Zosimus]], ''New History'' II.57&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantius then hurried east to [[Antioch]] to resume the [[Persian wars of Constantius II|war with Persia]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Theodoret, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' II, 30, 1–14, GCS&lt;/ref&gt; While Constantius was away from the eastern frontier in early 337, King [[Shapur II]] assembled a large army, which included war elephants, and launched an attack on Roman territory, laying waste to Mesopotamia&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Chronicon, s. a.'' 338 p. 234, 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; and putting the city of Nisibis under siege.&lt;ref&gt;Theodoret, ''Historia religiosa'' I, 11–12, edd. Canivet and Leroy-Molinghen, pp. 184–8&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial success, Shapur lifted his siege after his army missed an opportunity to exploit a collapsed wall.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; When Constantius learned of Shapur's withdrawal from Roman territory, he prepared his army for a counter-attack.

Constantius repeatedly defended the eastern border against invasions by the aggressive [[Sassanid Empire]] under Shapur. These conflicts were mainly limited to Sassanid sieges of the major fortresses of [[Roman Mesopotamia]], including [[Nisibis]] ([[Nusaybin]]), [[Singara]], and [[Diyarbakir|Amida]] ([[Diyarbakir]]). Although Shapur seems to have been victorious in most of these confrontations, the Sassanids were able to achieve little.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[Festus (historian)|Festus]], ''Brevarium'' XXVII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dignas, B. 2007 p. 89"&gt;Dignas, B. &amp; Winter, E., ''Rome and Persia in Late Antiquity'' (2007), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Romans won a decisive victory at the Battle of Narasara, killing Shapur's brother, Narses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]], ''Chronicle'' A.M. 5815&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Constantius was able to push back the invasion, and Shapur failed to make any significant gains.&lt;ref name="Dignas, B. 2007 p. 89"/&gt;

Meanwhile, Constantine II desired to retain control of Constans' realm, leading the brothers into open conflict. Constantine was killed in 340 near [[Aquileia]] during an ambush.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As a result, Constans took control of his deceased brother’s realms and became sole ruler of the Western two-thirds of the empire. This division lasted until 350, when Constans was assassinated by forces loyal to the [[Roman usurper|usurper]] [[Magnentius]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Zosimus]] ''New History'' II.58-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===War against Magnentius===
{{main|Roman civil war of 350–353}}
As the only surviving son of Constantine the Great, Constantius felt that the position of [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] was his alone,&lt;ref name="Zosimus, New History II.60"&gt;Zosimus, ''New History'' II.60&lt;/ref&gt; and he determined to march west to fight the usurper, [[Magnentius]]. However, feeling that the east still required some sort of imperial presence, he elevated his cousin [[Constantius Gallus]] to Caesar of the eastern provinces. As an extra measure to ensure the loyalty of his cousin, he married the elder of his two sisters, [[Constantina]], to him.&lt;ref name="Zosimus, New History II.60"/&gt;

Before facing Magnentius, Constantius first came to terms with [[Vetranio]], a loyal general in [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] who had recently been acclaimed emperor by his soldiers. Vetranio immediately sent letters to Constantius pledging his loyalty, which Constantius may have accepted simply in order to stop Magnentius from gaining more support. These events may have been spurred by the action of Constantina, who had since traveled east to marry Gallus. Constantius subsequently sent Vetranio the imperial diadem and acknowledged the general‘s new position as ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]''. However, when Constantius arrived, Vetranio willingly resigned his position and accepted Constantius’ offer of a comfortable retirement in [[Bithynia]].&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, ''New History'' II.59&lt;/ref&gt;

In 351, Constantius clashed with Magnentius in [[Pannonia]] with a large army. The ensuing [[Battle of Mursa Major]] was one of the largest and bloodiest battles ever between two Roman armies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XIII.8.5–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian the Apostate]], ''The Caesars'' XLII.9–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Zosimus]], ''New History'' II.46.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Roman History'' X.12&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a victory for Constantius, but a costly one. Magnentius survived the battle and, determined to fight on, withdrew into northern Italy. Rather than pursuing his opponent, however, Constantius turned his attention to securing the Danubian border, where he spent the early months of 352 campaigning against the [[Sarmatians]] along the middle [[Danube]]. After achieving his aims, Constantius advanced on Magnentius in Italy. This action led the cities of Italy to switch their allegiance to him and eject the usurper's garrisons. Again, Magnentius withdrew, this time to southern [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]].&lt;ref name="Potter, D.S. 2004 p. 474"&gt;Potter, D.S., ''The Roman Empire at Bay: AD 180–395'' (2004), p. 474&lt;/ref&gt;

In 353, Constantius and Magnentius met for the final time at the [[Battle of Mons Seleucus]] in southern Gaul, and again Constantius emerged the victor.&lt;ref name="Potter, D.S. 2004 p. 474"/&gt; Magnentius, realizing the futility of continuing his position, committed suicide on 10 August 353.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Historiae Romanae Breviarium'' X.12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sole ruler of the empire==
[[File:Solidus-Constantius Gallus-thessalonica RIC 149.jpg|thumb|left|Constantius Gallus was a paternal cousin of Constantius. In 350, he was made [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] by Constantius and was married to the Emperor's sister, [[Constantina]]. However, his mismanagement of the eastern provinces led to his downfall and death in 354.]]
Constantius spent much of the rest of 353 and early 354 on campaign against the [[Alamanni]] on the Danube frontier. The campaign was successful and raiding by the Alamanni ceased temporarily. In the meantime, Constantius had been receiving disturbing reports regarding the actions of his cousin Gallus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' 14.1.10&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly as a result of these reports, Constantius concluded a peace with the Alamanni and traveled to [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.10.16&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mediolanum, Constantius first summoned [[Ursicinus (Roman general)|Ursicinus]], Gallus’ ''magister equitum'', for reasons that remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.3–5&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius then summoned Gallus and Constantina.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.6&lt;/ref&gt; Although Gallus and Constantina complied with the order at first, when Constantina died in [[Bithynia]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Gallus began to hesitate. However, after some convincing by one of Constantius’ agents,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Gallus continued his journey west, passing through [[Constantinople]] and [[Thracia (Roman province)|Thrace]] to [[Poetovio]] ([[Ptuj]]) in [[Pannonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roman-emperors.org"&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/gallus.htm Banchich, T.M., 'DIR-Gallus' from De Imperatoribus Romanis]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Poetovio, Gallus was arrested by the soldiers of Constantius under the command of [[Barbatio]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.20&lt;/ref&gt; Gallus was then moved to [[Pula|Pola]] and interrogated. Gallus claimed that it was Constantina who was to blame for all the trouble while he was in charge of the eastern provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.22&lt;/ref&gt; This angered Constantius so greatly that he immediately ordered Gallus' execution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIV.11.23&lt;/ref&gt; He soon changed his mind, however, and recanted the order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XIII.9.20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Libanius]], ''Orations'' XVIII.152&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for Gallus, this second order was delayed by [[Eusebius (praepositus sacri cubiculi)|Eusebius]], one of Constantius' eunuchs, and Gallus was executed.&lt;ref name="roman-emperors.org"/&gt;

===Religious issues===

====Paganism====
{{See also|Anti-paganism policy of Constantius II}}
In spite of some of the edicts issued by Constantius, he never made any attempt to disband the various Roman priestly colleges or the [[Vestal Virgin]]s, he never acted against the various pagan schools, and, at times, he actually made some effort to protect paganism. In fact, he even ordered the election of a priest for Africa.&lt;ref name="Vasiliev, A.A 1958 p. 68"&gt;Vasiliev, A.A, ''History of the Byzantine Empire 324–1453'' (1958), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he remained [[pontifex maximus]] and was deified by the Roman Senate after his death. His relative moderation toward paganism is reflected by the fact that it was over twenty years after his death, during the reign of [[Gratian]], that any pagan senator protested his treatment of their religion.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, M.R., ''The Making of a Christian Aristocracy: Social and Religious Change in the Western Roman Empire'' (2002), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

Pagan-related edicts issued by Constantius (by himself or with others) included:
* The death penalty for those performing pagan [[sacrifice]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirsch|first1=Jonathan|title=God against the gods : the history of the war between monotheism and polytheism|date=2005|publisher=Penguin Compass|location=New York|isbn=0142196339|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The banning of sacrifices&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.10.2 &amp; 16.10.6&lt;/ref&gt;
* The closing of pagan temples&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.10.4 &amp; 16.10.6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Edicts against soothsayers and magicians&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 9.16.4, 9.16.5 &amp; 9.16.6&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====
Although often considered an [[Arianism|Arian]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A.H.M, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: a Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1986), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius ultimately preferred a third, compromise version that lay somewhere in between [[Arianism]] and the [[Nicene Creed]], retrospectively called [[Semi-Arianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelikan, J.J., ''The Christian Tradition'' (1989), pp. 209–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, M., ''There is No Crime for Those who Have Christ'' (2005), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign he attempted to mold the Christian church to follow this compromise position, convening several Christian councils. The most notable of these were the [[Council of Rimini]] and its twin at [[Silifke|Seleucia]], which met in 359 and 360 respectively. "Unfortunately for his memory the theologians whose advice he took were ultimately discredited and the malcontents whom he pressed to conform emerged victorious," writes the historian [[A.H.M. Jones]]. "The great councils of 359–60 are therefore not reckoned [[Ecumenical council|ecumenical]] in the tradition of the church, and Constantius II is not remembered as a restorer of unity, but as a [[Arianism|heretic]] who arbitrarily imposed his will on the church."&lt;ref name="Jones, A.H.M 1986 p. 118"&gt;Jones, A.H.M, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: a Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1986), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian-related edicts issued by Constantius (by himself or with others) included:
* Exemption from compulsory public service for the clergy&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.9&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exemption from compulsory public service for the sons of clergy&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tax exemptions for clergy and their servants,&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.8&lt;/ref&gt; and later for their family&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.14&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clergy and the issue of private property&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.15, 12.1.49 &amp; 8.4.7&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bishops exempted from being tried in secular courts&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.12&lt;/ref&gt;
* Christian prostitutes only able to be bought by Christians&lt;ref&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 15.8.1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====

|url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/# |title= Belt Section with Medallions of Constantius II and Faustina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.]]
Judaism faced some severe restrictions under Constantius, who seems to have followed an anti-Jewish policy in line with that of his father.&lt;ref name="Schäfer, P. 2003 pp. 180-1"&gt;Schäfer, P., ''The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World'' (2003), pp. 180–1&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his reign, Constantius issued a double edict in concert with his brothers limiting the ownership of slaves by Jewish people&lt;ref name="Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2"&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.9.2&lt;/ref&gt; and banning marriages between Jews and Christian women.&lt;ref name="Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2"/&gt; A later edict issued by Constantius after becoming sole emperor decreed that a person who was proven to have converted from Christianity to Judaism would have all of his property confiscated by the state.&lt;ref name="Codex Theodosianus 16.8.7"&gt;[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.8.7&lt;/ref&gt; However, Constantius' actions in this regard may not have been so much to do with Jewish religion as with Jewish business—apparently, privately owned Jewish businesses were often in competition with state-owned businesses. As a result, Constantius may have sought to provide an advantage to state-owned businesses by limiting the skilled workers and slaves available to Jewish businesses.&lt;ref name="Schäfer, P. 2003 pp. 180-1"/&gt;

Jew-related edicts issued by Constantius (by himself or with others) included:
* Weaving women who moved from working for the government to working for Jews must be restored to the government&lt;ref name="Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2"/&gt;
* Jews may not marry Christian women&lt;ref name="Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2"/&gt;
* Jews may not attempt to convert Christian women&lt;ref name="Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2"/&gt;
* Any non-Jewish slave bought by a Jew will be confiscated by the state&lt;ref name="Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2"/&gt;

===More usurpers and Julian===
[[File:Bust of Constantius II (Mary Harrsch).jpg|thumb|Bust of Constantius II in the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|Museum of Archaeology]]]]
On 11 August 355, the [[magister militum]] [[Claudius Silvanus]] revolted in Gaul. Silvanus had surrendered to Constantius after the [[Battle of Mursa Major]]. Constantius had made him magister militum in 353 with the purpose of blocking the German threats, a feat that Silvanus achieved by bribing the German tribes with the money he had collected. A plot organized by members of Constantius' court led the emperor to recall Silvanus. After Silvanus revolted, he received a letter from Constantius recalling him to Milan, but which made no reference to the revolt. [[Ursicinus (Roman general)|Ursicinus]], who was meant to replace Silvanus, bribed some troops, and Silvanus was killed.

Constantius realised that too many threats still faced the Empire, however, and he could not possibly handle all of them by himself. So on 6 November 355,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.17&lt;/ref&gt; he elevated his last remaining male relative, [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], to the rank of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.5–16&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, Julian was married to [[Helena, wife of Julian|Helena]], the last surviving sister of Constantius.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.18&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius soon sent Julian off to Gaul.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Constantius spent the next few years overseeing affairs in the western part of the empire primarily from his base at Mediolanum. In 357 he visited [[Rome]] for the only time in his life. The same year, he forced [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] and [[Quadi]] invaders out of Pannonia and [[Moesia|Moesia Inferior]], then led a successful counter-attack across the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVI.12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 357–58, Constantius received ambassadors from [[Shapur II]] who demanded that Rome restore the lands surrendered by [[Narseh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVII.5.3–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XII.9.25-7&lt;/ref&gt; Despite rejecting these terms,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVII.5.9–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], ''Extracts of History'' XII.9.28-9&lt;/ref&gt; Constantius tried to avert war with the [[Sassanid Empire]] by sending two embassies to Shapur II.&lt;ref&gt;[[Libanius]], ''Epistle'' 331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVII.14.1–3 &amp; XVIII.6.17-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eunapius]], ''Lives of the Sophists'' VI. 5.1–10&lt;/ref&gt; Shapur II nevertheless launched another invasion of Roman Mesopotamia. In 360, when news reached Constantius that Shapur II had destroyed [[Singara]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.6&lt;/ref&gt; and taken [[Hasankeyf|Kiphas]] ([[Hasankeyf]]), [[Diyarbakır|Amida]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIX&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cizre|Ad Tigris]] ([[Cizre]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.7.1–16&lt;/ref&gt; he decided to travel east to face the re-emergent threat.

===Usurpation of Julian and crises in the east===
[[File:Missorium Kerch.jpg|thumb|300px|Missorium of Kerch depicting Constantius II on horseback with a spear. He is preceded by victory and accompanied by a guardsman.]]
In the meantime, Julian had won some victories against the [[Alamanni]], who had once again invaded [[Roman Gaul]]. However, when Constantius requested reinforcements from Julian’s army for the eastern campaign, the Gallic legions revolted and proclaimed Julian ''Augustus''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian the Apostate]], ''Letter To The Senate And People of Athens'', X.12–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Libanius]], ''Orations'' XII.58 &amp; XVIII.90-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Historiae Romanae Breviarium'' X.15.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.4.1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

On account of the immediate Sassanid threat, Constantius was unable to directly respond to his cousin’s usurpation, other than by sending missives in which he tried to convince Julian to resign the title of ''Augustus'' and be satisfied with that of ''Caesar''. By 361, Constantius saw no alternative but to face the usurper with force, and yet the threat of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] remained. Constantius had already spent part of early 361 unsuccessfully attempting to re-take the fortress of Ad Tigris.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.11.6–25&lt;/ref&gt; After a time he had withdrawn to [[Antioch]] to regroup and prepare for a confrontation with [[Shapur II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XXI.7.7 &amp; 13.1–5&lt;/ref&gt; The campaigns of the previous year had inflicted heavy losses on the Sassanids, however, and they did not attempt another round of campaigns that year. This temporary respite in hostilities allowed Constantius to turn his full attention to facing Julian.&lt;ref name="Vagi, D.L. 2001 p. 508"&gt;Vagi, D.L. &amp; Coquand, T., ''Coinage and History of the Roman Empire'' (2001), p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Constantius immediately gathered his forces and set off west. However, by the time he reached [[Mopsuestia]] in Cilicia, it was clear that he was fatally ill and would not survive to face Julian. Apparently, realising his death was near, Constantius had himself baptised by [[Arianism|Euzoius]], the [[Semi-Arianism|Semi-Arian]] bishop of [[Antioch]], and then declared that Julian was his rightful successor.&lt;ref name="Vagi, D.L. 2001 p. 508"/&gt; Constantius II died of fever on 3 November 361.&lt;ref&gt;The manuscript of Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' 21.15.2 reads ''tertium nonarum Octobrium'', which is the equivalent of 5 October. The latest editor of the ''Res Gestae'' accepts Otto Seeck's emendation ''tertium nonarum Novembrium'' which is the equivalent of 3 November. T.D. Barnes (''Classical Philology'', 88 [1993], p. 64f) provides indirect evidence showing 3 November is a better fit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages and children==
Constantius II was married three times:

First to a [[Daughter of Julius Constantius|daughter]] of his half-uncle [[Julius Constantius]], whose name is unknown. She was a full-sister of Gallus and a half-sister of Julian. She died c. 352/3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/gallus.htm |title=Gallus Caesar (15 March 351 - 354 A.D.) |last=Banchich |first=Thomas M. |website=De Imperatoribus Romanis |access-date=2018-09-07 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, to [[Eusebia (empress)|Eusebia]], a woman of [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] origin, originally from the city of [[Thessaloniki]], whom Constantius married before his defeat of Magnentius in 353. She died in 360.&lt;ref name="juneau"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Juneau | first = J. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Piety and Politics: Eusebia and Constantius at Court | journal = The Classical Quarterly |series=New Series | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | pages = 641–644 | publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = | date= December 1999 | doi =10.1093/cq/49.2.641-a | id = | jstor=639898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third and lastly, in 360, to [[Faustina (empress)|Faustina]], who gave birth to Constantius' only child, a posthumous daughter named [[Flavia Maxima Constantia]], who later married Emperor [[Gratian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/21*.html |first=Ammianus |last=Marcellinus |author-link=Ammianus Marcellinus |title=The Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus |volume=Vol. 2, Book 21, chapter 15 |year=1940 |translator-first=J.

==Reputation==
[[File:Nummus of Constantius II (YORYM 2014 395 59) obverse.jpg|thumb|left|A ''[[nummus]]'' of Constantius II]]
Constantius II is a particularly difficult figure to judge properly due to the hostility of most sources toward him. A. H. M. Jones writes that Constantius "appears in the pages of [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] as a conscientious emperor but a vain and stupid man, an easy prey to flatterers. He was timid and suspicious, and interested persons could easily play on his fears for their own advantage."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A. H. M., ''Later Roman Empire'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kent and M. and A. Hirmer suggest that Constantius "has suffered at the hands of unsympathetic authors, ecclesiastical and civil alike. To orthodox churchmen he was a bigoted supporter of the Arian heresy, to [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]] and the many who have subsequently taken his part he was a murderer, a tyrant and inept as a ruler". They go on to add, "Most contemporaries seem in fact to have held him in high esteem, and he certainly inspired loyalty in a way his brother could not".&lt;ref&gt;Kent, J.P.C., Hirmer, M. &amp; Hirmer, A. ''Roman Coins'' (1978), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54668">The '''death of Joan Robinson Hill''' at 38 years old led to her husband, John Hill, becoming the first person to be indicted by the State of Texas on the charge of murder by omission. The case precipitated a series of events that included the 1972 murder of John Hill and, two years later, the fatal police shooting of the man accused of that murder.

She died following a short illness on March 19, 1969. Autopsy examinations failed to determine a cause of death beyond an infection from an unknown source. Her father, Ash Robinson, subsequently accused Hill of poisoning his daughter, and petitioned the district attorney to prosecute her husband for murder. Hill's murder trial was held in February 1971 but ended in a mistrial. As a second trial was approaching, Hill was gunned down by an intruder at his home. A suspect, Bobby Wayne Vandiver, was arrested and indicted for the murder, but was killed in a shootout with police before his trial. Two other suspects, Marcia McKittrick and Lilla Paulus, were convicted as accomplices to Hill's murder and served time in prison.

The case was the subject of [[Thomas Thompson (American author)|Thomas Thompson]]'s 1976 book ''Blood and Money'' and the 1981 made-for-television film ''[[Murder in Texas]]''.

==Background==
{{main article|Joan Robinson Hill}}
On September 28, 1957, Joan Robinson married Dr. John Hill,&lt;ref name=Chronicle-2012-09-24/&gt;&lt;ref name=wedding&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/831253/joan_robinson_hill_marriage/?|title=Houston Wedding|date=September 29, 1957|page=20|accessdate=August 7, 2014|publisher=Valley Morning Star|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; described by the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' as "one of the city's leading plastic surgeons".&lt;ref name=Chronicle-2009-03-19&gt;{{cite news|first=J.R. |last=Gonzales |url=http://blog.chron.com/bayoucityhistory/2009/03/40-years-later-joan-robinson-hill/ |title=40 years later: Joan Robinson Hill |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=March 19, 2009 |accessdate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had a son, Robert Ashton "Boot" Hill, born on June 14, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joan Robinson Hill 1960.jpg|thumb|left|Robinson Hill as chairman of Houston's Humane Society Ball, 1959]]
John and Joan Hill became a regular part of Houston's social scene,&lt;ref name=Chronicle-2012-09-24/&gt; but largely led separate lives.&lt;ref name=Crime-2013-03-19/&gt; Joan focused on her equestrian career while John devoted his spare time to performing and listening to music.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 49–52&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1968, the Hills had begun to have significant conflicts in their marriage.&lt;ref name=Chronicle-2012-09-24/&gt; After beginning an extramarital affair with a woman named Ann Kurth in the fall of 1968, Hill left his wife and began divorce proceedings against her, but withdrew the petition when the couple reconciled shortly before Christmas of that year.&lt;ref name=Crime-2013-03-19&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crimemagazine.com/hill-robinson-murders-1969 |title=The Hill-Robinson Murders – 1969  |publisher=Crime Magazine |date= |accessdate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 82–87&lt;/ref&gt; John continued to see Kurth after returning to live with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson Hill died on March 19, 1969, at Sharpstown General Hospital after contracting an illness that was initially thought to be [[influenza]].&lt;ref name=Crime-2013-03-19/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP-1985-02-16&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1985/Ash-Robinson-Dies-In-Florida-Hospital/id-4361e2768358c89a8e42d062ba5c4094 |title=Ash Robinson Dies In Florida Hospital |agency=Associated Press |date=February 16, 1985 |accessdate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her symptoms included fever, vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea.&lt;ref name=MJ-1980-11-24/&gt; She was first treated at home by her husband, but admitted to hospital when her condition worsened.&lt;ref name=AP-1985-02-16/&gt;

==Death, investigation, and trials==

===Death===
Robinson Hill died on March 19, 1969, at Sharpstown General Hospital shortly after contracting an illness that was initially thought to be [[influenza]].&lt;ref name=Crime-2013-03-19/&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-1985-02-16"/&gt;

Upon being told that his wife was dead, John Hill's cries filled the small hospital.  Patients on the second floor of the building came to the doors of their rooms in an effort to learn what had happened.  Hill managed to ask someone to call a friend and his wife, who lived nearby.  Jim Oates was a doctor and a fellow musician; his wife, Dottie, was a nurse. The couple had just seen the Hills five days earlier at Houston's annual wild game dinner. Dottie Oates did not at first recognize Joan Robinson Hill, due to her edema and discoloration from ruptured [[Capillary|superficial blood vessels]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

===First autopsy===
Texas state law at the time required an autopsy by the county coroner for anyone who died in a hospital within twenty-four hours of admission.  The law stated that the autopsy must be performed and a cause of death determined before any embalming or burial could take place, and provided criminal penalties for its breach.  Drs. Bertinot and Lanza, who had attended Robinson Hill, were summoned back to the hospital when she died.  Dr. Bertinot spoke to John Hill about the legal need for an autopsy and called the hospital's pathologist to start the process. Hill asked Jim Oates to call a local funeral home to claim Robinson Hill's body. Less than four hours after her death, the funeral home removed Robinson Hill's body from the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;

Within an hour after moving the body from Sharpstown General, the funeral home began the process of [[embalming]] Robinson Hill's body.  The hospital's pathologist, Dr. Arthur Morse, arrived at the funeral home at 10 a.m. to carry out the autopsy, only to find that the body had already been embalmed.  Dr. Morse did not have the ability to take blood samples, since Robinson Hill's blood had been replaced by the embalming fluid.  Morse concluded his autopsy at 11:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. without finding any signs of what caused Robinson Hill's death aside from a maroon coloration of her [[pancreas]] and offered an opinion that she may have died from [[pancreatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans 2007, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second autopsy===

On Thursday, March 20, 1969, Diane Settegast and Eunice Woolen, who stayed with the Hills as house guests a week before Joan's death, returned to Houston to attend Robinson Hill's funeral, and Settegast called on Hill to pay her respects. On arriving at the house she found him upstairs in the music room with his son and some friends, watching a [[Laurel and Hardy]] film and laughing. Surprised that he did not appear to be grieving, she began to leave in disgust, but was stopped by Hill before she reached the front door. During the ensuing conversation, she expressed disbelief at the speed of her friend's death, and asked Hill why he had not been able to help her. Hill replied that he wanted to take his wife to hospital but she refused to go, saying "You know what she was like about hospitals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/828234/diane_settegast_testimony_1971/?|title=Witness Testifies at Doctor's Trial|date=February 23, 1971|page=4|publisher=Corpus Christi Caller-Times|accessdate=August 23, 2014|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Settegast became suspicious as she did not recognize Hill's observation of her friend, and voiced her concerns to Ash Robinson. Since receiving Dr. Morse's opinion that his daughter had died from pancreatitis, Robinson had been consulting doctors on the matter, who had advised him that this was an unlikely cause of death. On the morning of Friday, March 21, the day of Joan Robinson Hill's funeral, Ash Robinson visited the office of Assistant District Attorney [[I. D. McMaster]], where he accused John Hill of killing his wife, telling McMaster of the circumstances surrounding her death and autopsy. After listening to Robinson's story, McMaster said that he would look into it, then telephoned Harris County Medical Examiner Joseph Jachimczyk, telling him to go to the funeral home, examine the body before the funeral, and stop the service if necessary. Jachimczyk then telephoned two people–the administrator of Sharpstown Hospital, and Morse. On hearing of the circumstances in which Morse had performed his autopsy, he ordered the pathologist to hand over blood and urine specimens taken from Robinson Hill, and his preliminary report. Jachimczyk felt there was enough material for him to perform his own autopsy. He then drove to the funeral home to view the body, doing so as mourners began to arrive for the service, but saw no need to halt proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 119–125&lt;/ref&gt;

While awaiting the medical examiner's results, Ash Robinson continued to gather evidence against his son-in-law, assembling a team of respected doctors at his home to discuss the case. These included his general practitioner, Ed Gouldin, and Grady Hallman. Robinson also took statements from people connected with his daughter, including Settegast, Woolen, and the Hill's household employees Archie and Effie Green. Jachimczyk delivered his report on the second autopsy at the end of March, ruling out any poisoning, and concluding, "it is my opinion based upon a reasonable probability that the cause of death is due to acute focal hepatitis, probably viral in origin."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 129–134&lt;/ref&gt; On reading the report, McMaster felt there was no case, but Robinson refused to believe that no crime had been committed. He hired lawyer Frank Briscoe, a former [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] District Attorney who had recently left office. As part of his investigation, Briscoe spoke to Morse. He asked the pathologist whether it would be possible to inject someone with hepatitis. Morse felt this an unlikely scenario, but offered the lawyer an alternative opinion on how Robinson Hill may have contracted the virus. He said that he had been told that in the days prior to her death Robinson Hill had eaten both [[shellfish]] and [[Escargot|snail]]s, and Morse felt one of these may have caused her to contract hepatitis. Robinson then petitioned his son-in-law to give permission for Joan's body to be exhumed for another autopsy, but Hill refused.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 134–136&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third autopsy===

Ash Robinson sought to hire "the best pathologist in the United States" to conduct another autopsy on his daughter. Robinson's search led him to Dr. Milton Helpern, who was the chief medical examiner for New York City at the time.&lt;ref name=killer&gt;Evans 2007, pp. 87–91&lt;/ref&gt;  Helpern agreed to come to Houston to examine Robinson Hill's body five months after her death.&lt;ref name=AP-1985-02-16/&gt;  An autopsy was also requested by a Harris County [[grand jury]] investigating the death of Robinson Hill. That autopsy was performed by a team of ten doctors led by Dr. Robert Bucklin, who was then the medical examiner for [[Galveston County, Texas|Galveston County]], and including Dr. Helpern, who was deputized as an acting Harris County [[medical examiner]].&lt;ref name=reports&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19691011&amp;id=1wFaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FEsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4756,1865525|title=Houston Socialite's Death Seen As Result Meningitis|date=October 11, 1969|publisher=Victoria Advocate|page=5B|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as the casket was opened, Helpern found pieces of dried mud in it, indicating that the casket had been opened after Robinson Hill was originally buried. When questioned, the funeral home informed the medical team present at the autopsy that John Hill had obtained an order to disinter his wife three days after her funeral.  Hill claimed he wanted to retrieve a piece of jewelry that had been buried with her. While making the wake and funeral arrangements, Hill insisted that his wife be buried with no jewelry at all—not even her wedding ring.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  Helpern found nothing amiss related to the disinterment, but noted that Robinson Hill's stomach and its contents were never removed and examined at the original autopsy. The pathologist's disapproval became disbelief when he discovered that Robinson Hill's brain and heart were missing.&lt;ref name=killer/&gt;

Dr. Morse then made an embarrassed admission to not returning the organs prior to burial.  Morse offered that he did, however, know the whereabouts of Robinson Hill's brain—it was in the trunk of his car. The Texas pathologist retrieved the brain for Dr. Helpern's examination.  Helpern thought there might be traces of meningitis, but declined to state whether he thought this was a cause of Robinson Hill's death.{{#tag:ref|When another doctor stated that he saw no evidence of meningitis in Robinson Hill's spinal cord, rumors began to circulate that the brain Morse produced from his car trunk was not the brain of Joan Robinson Hill. When issuing his findings, Dr. Helpern discounted the rumors.&lt;ref name=killer/&gt;|name=brain|group=note}}  He examined the body of Joan Robinson Hill for seven and a half hours; Helpern then went back to New York with his tissue samples, saying he would issue a report on his findings at a later date.&lt;ref name=killer/&gt;

The series of autopsies indicated that Robinson Hill had suffered a "massive infection" from an undetermined source, but because the body had been embalmed before an initial examination was conducted, an exact cause of death could not be identified.&lt;ref name=AP-1985-02-16/&gt; The hospital and the Harris County medical examiner initially listed Robinson Hill's cause of death as [[hepatitis]], but there were no signs of the disease (such as [[jaundice]]) noted; medical test results were also not indicative of hepatitis.&lt;ref name=reports/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sizer, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Bucklin listed Robinson Hill's cause of death as meningitis and [[septicemia]].&lt;ref name=reports/&gt; Following the autopsy, Joseph Jachimczyk issued a fresh report in which he observed "It is now my opinion that Joan Robinson Hill came to her death as a result of a fulminating infectious process, the specific nature of which is no longer determinable." He went on to recommend that the matter be investigated by a grand jury.&lt;ref name=MJ-1980-11-24&gt;{{cite news|title=Toxic shock suspected in death of heiress |publisher=The Milwaukee Journal |date=November 24, 1980 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Milton Helpern did not issue his report until April 1970, more than a year after the death of Robinson Hill. Helpern's report noted that John Hill's treatment of his wife at home and the delay in seeking specialized medical attention at a hospital were factors in the death of Robinson Hill.&lt;ref name=Post-1977-02-07&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson |first=Thomas |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/134013812/?terms=Husband%27s%2Binfidelity%2Bmarks%2Bbeginning%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bend |title=Husband's infidelity marks beginning of the end |publisher=The Palm Beach Post |date=February 7, 1977 |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |pages=13–20}}(subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/830641/john_hill_indicted_1970/|title=Doctor Indicted In Wife's Death|date=May 23, 1970|publisher=Abilene Reporter-News|page=6|accessdate=August 8, 2014|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The will===
When John Hill filed his wife's last will and testament shortly after her death, Ash Robinson quickly produced another will, which he said had been written at the time Joan was separated from Hill. The will made Robinson her executor, left everything to him, and asked that Robinson and his wife have custody of the Hills' son, Robert. It was signed by two of Robinson's friends, one a former employee. Hill believed the will to be a forgery and hired three handwriting experts to attest to that fact. Thompson observes that Robinson Hill's signature was different to that in a previous will, and that the will had been "clumsily typed, replete with spelling mistakes and language more likely to be used by someone imitating legal terminology". Hill asked the District Attorney's office to investigate, but Cecil Haden, who was serving on the grand jury at the time, suggested the matter be dealt with once the issue of Robinson Hill's death had been addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Hill contested the will in 1978, claiming that it was a forgery, but a probate jury found in favor of Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13127346/joan_hills_ex_husband_says_will_changed/ |title=Joan Hill's ex-husband says her will was changed |newspaper=The Odessa American |date=April 1, 1978 |page=29 |via=Newspapers.com |accessdate=August 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sold/&gt;

===Prosecution and murder of John Hill===
After Robinson Hill's death, Hill married Ann Kurth in June 1969,&lt;ref name=Crime-2013-03-19/&gt; but divorced Kurth less than a year later, shortly before he was indicted for the murder of Robinson Hill.&lt;ref name=AP-1985-02-16/&gt; He divorced Kurth in spite of the advice of his defense attorney, who told him that if they remained married, Kurth [[spousal privilege|could not testify against him]].&lt;ref name=Post-1977-02-08&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson |first=Thomas |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/134013972/?terms=uncovering%2Ba%2Bmurder%2Bcase |title=Uncovering a murder case |publisher=The Palm Beach Post |date=February 8, 1977 |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |pages=49–53}}(subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Hill's marriage to Kurth, Ash Robinson accused his former son-in-law of poisoning his daughter, and hired a team of private detectives to keep him under surveillance.&lt;ref name=People-1976-10-04&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkins |first=Barbara |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20066953,00.html |title=A Texas Heiress Dies, and Tommy Thompson Spins a Tale of Violence, Love and Intrigue |publisher=People Magazine |date=October 4, 1976 |accessdate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also petitioned the District Attorney to launch a murder investigation.&lt;ref name=Crime-2013-03-19/&gt; Frank Briscoe subsequently discussed the case with McMaster, who had worked as his junior during his time as a District Attorney. Neither man was convinced that Hill had murdered his wife, but they felt that there was enough evidence to put the matter before a grand jury. The grand jury began hearing evidence in the summer of 1969, and rumors began to circulate among the Houston medical fraternity that Hill had played a role in Robinson Hill's death. In response to the gossip, Hill contacted Clyde Wilson, a private investigator who had worked for Robinson. Wilson suggested that if Hill wished to clear his name, he should take a [[polygraph test]]. Hill decided instead to give a statement under the administration of [[sodium pentothal]] (alternatively known as [[truth serum]]) at which his own lawyer and McMaster would be present. The drug was administered at Sharpstown Hospital by anesthesiologist Dr. Richard Smith, who had occasionally assisted Hill during surgery, but who both sides felt would be a neutral party. Although Hill was deemed to have passed the examination, McMaster was suspicious that the drug had not worked properly because he felt that Hill's answers seemed too composed.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 137–147&lt;/ref&gt;

The first grand jury to examine the case retired without indicting Hill. Robinson then urged Briscoe to pressure the District Attorney to order an exhumation, then fired the lawyer when he refused, after which he retained the services of the law firm [[Vinson and Elkins]]. District Attorney [[Carol Vance]] then put the case before a second grand jury to see if they would order an exhumation. When they did, Hill hired his own lawyer, Don Fullenweider, who asked his partner, respected defense attorney [[Richard Haynes (criminal lawyer)|Richard Haynes]], to represent the doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 148–159&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1970, the case was heard by a third grand jury, on which sat Cecil Haden, a prominent Houston businessman and close friend and associate of Ash Robinson. This panel heard testimony from Ann Kurth, less than one day after she was divorced from Hill on March 12. She told them that Hill had confessed to killing his wife and had also tried to kill Kurth on three occasions, and that the physician had medicated himself with an antidote to the sodium pentothal prior to the test, a claim Richard Smith dismissed as implausible.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1976, pp. 174–188"&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 174–188&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|On hearing Kurth's claims about Hill's alleged self-medication, Smith said "I don't care if John Hill injected himself with holy water, he was still anesthetized.

Haden suggested that Helpern present his conclusions in person. District Judge Wendell Odom agreed, and Helpern presented his findings in April 1970.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1976, pp. 174–188"/&gt; In response to Helpern's presentation, Haynes suggested that Hill testify before the grand jury, but the evidence Hill gave contradicted that given by others involved in the case, and his cool and aloof manner began to convince McMaster and his fellow Assistant District Attorney, [[Ernie Ernst]], that Hill had murdered his wife. In spite of this, they determined that there was not enough evidence to indict him. However, following some research, Ernst suggested that they could try him for failing to provide an adequate level of care, which had resulted in her death. The jury voted 10–2 to indict Hill for murder by omission, deciding that he had "willfully, intentionally and culpably" contributed to his wife's death because he had not given her sufficient medical help.&lt;ref name=Crime-2013-03-19/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP-1985-02-16/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 189–209&lt;/ref&gt; The state of Texas had not previously indicted anyone on a charge of murder by omission.&lt;ref name=Laredo-1999-03-19/&gt;

Kurth said that on the night of their auto accident, Hill went into detail about how he had killed Joan Robinson Hill.  She claimed that the petri dishes contained cultures grown from all forms of human waste, and that Hill had initially injected the cultures into pastries he served to his wife.  When Robinson Hill fell only mildly ill from their ingestion, she asked her husband for something to cure the illness.

===Murder of John Hill===
On September 24, 1972, a few weeks before the second trial was to start, Hill was shot dead by a masked gunman during a robbery at his mansion as Hill and his wife returned home from a medical conference in [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name=Chronicle-2012-09-24&gt;{{cite news|first=J.R. |last=Gonzales |url=http://blog.chron.com/bayoucityhistory/2012/09/40-years-later-dr-john-hills-scandalous-saga/#7478101=0 |title=40 years later: Dr. John Hill’s scandalous saga |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=September 24, 2012 |accessdate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP-1985-02-16/&gt;&lt;ref name=Post-1977-02-09/&gt; The masked intruder forced his way into the Hills' home about a half hour before John and Connie Hill were due to arrive home. The man bound Hill's mother and son and taped their mouths with adhesive tape. When the Hills arrived, Connie rang the home's doorbell and was greeted by someone in a green mask she initially thought to be her stepson playing a joke.  The intruder grabbed Connie Hill, saying "This is a robbery." She was able to struggle away from him and run down the street. As she ran and called out for help, she heard shots fired. A neighbor heard her cries for help, let her in, and let her call the police. When the police and an ambulance arrived at the Hill home, they found John Hill in the foyer, face down. Standing over him was his 12-year-old son; feet and arms bound, he had managed to hop from a back room of the house.  The adhesive tape had come loose from his mouth and he cried, "They've killed my daddy." The ambulance attendant searched for vital signs but found none. When the body was turned over, Hill's eyes, nose and mouth were found to have been sealed shut with adhesive tape by his killer. The police noted this type of killing was prevalent in the local underworld. John Hill was beaten and shot three times: in the chest, shoulder and right arm.&lt;ref name=doctor&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19810711&amp;id=rKMyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4u4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1193,504369|title=Two wives later, death catches up with doctor|author=Haines, Max|date=July 11, 1981|publisher=Ottawa Citizen|page=88|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19720927&amp;id=BbVjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VYEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5303,4143815|title=Struggle Seen In Hill Death|date=September 27, 1972|publisher=Victoria Advocate|page=6B|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 265–266&lt;/ref&gt;

Connie and Robert Hill believed that Robinson Hill's father, Ash Robinson, had ordered Hill's execution, and launched a $7.6-million lawsuit against him for wrongful death. Robinson denied responsibility for the shooting, but maintained that Hill was to blame for the death of his daughter.&lt;ref name=AP-1985-02-16/&gt; In 1977, following a seven-week hearing, a civil jury cleared Robinson of any involvement in the death of his son-in-law.&lt;ref name=MJ-1980-11-24/&gt;&lt;ref name=Advocate-1977-10-22&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19771022&amp;id=stZHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FYAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6992,4948731 |title=Robinson innocent of plotting death |publisher=The Victoria Advocate |date=October 22, 1977 |accessdate=August 2, 2014 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the wrongful death suit against Ash Robinson, Thomas Thompson, the author of ''Blood and Money'', offered an opinion that Hill probably did not have enough medical knowledge to kill his wife without leaving any evidence.  Thompson, who had observed many doctors while writing books, described plastic surgeons and orthopedists as being the "carpenters" of the medical world.  He characterized internists and researchers as being the real thinkers of medicine, and said that Hill's interest in research applied only to the music world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/856355/thompson_believed_hill_wasnt_smart/?|title=Author Claims Hill Couldn't Have Perpetrated 'Perfect Crime'|date=October 14, 1977|page=2|publisher=Brownsville Herald|accessdate=August 14, 2014|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arrest and trial of Bobby Vandiver and Marcia McKittrick====
Houston detectives Jerry Carpenter and Joe Gamino were called to River Oaks after a boy discovered Hill's abandoned briefcase, which had been stolen during the robbery. While searching the scene, Carpenter found a gun beneath a bush. A ballistics expert was able to determine that the bullets fired at Hill had been handmade, and as a result of this Houston police were able to trace the weapon to a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 269–271&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Thompson identifies the doctor as Orrin Staves,&lt;ref name="Thompson 1976, pp. 272–273"&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; while court records name him as William Mitchell.&lt;ref name=Paulustrial/&gt;|name=doctor|group=note}} When questioned as to how the weapon had found its way to River Oaks, the doctor said it had been stolen by a woman whom he described as "a whore". He went on to explain that he had entertained two prostitutes, who stole some money and one of his cars while he was sleeping. He had taken the gun and planned to go looking for the women, but as he was about to leave, he was called by another prostitute who called herself Dusty, who asked if he wanted company. While she was with him, he said, she took the gun. He then said he believed Dusty's real name was Marcia McKittrick.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1976, pp. 272–273"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The doctor later testified that he gave the gun to McKittrick.&lt;ref name=Paulustrial/&gt;|name=thegun|group=note}} Carpenter, a former vice squad officer, used his old contacts to trace McKittrick, and discovered she was involved with Bobby Wayne Vandiver, an habitual criminal who had established himself as a pimp following his most recent release from prison.&lt;ref name=Post-1977-02-10&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/134014600/?terms=Dr.%2BJohn%2BHill%27s%2Bkiller%2Blinks%2Bcase%2Bto%2BAsh%2BRobinson|title=Dr. John Hill's killer links case to Ash Robinson |publisher=The Palm Beach Post |date=February 10, 1977 |accessdate=August 7, 2014 |pages=33, 49}}{subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/134014662/?terms=Vandiver%27s%2Blifestyle%2Bled%2Bhim%2Bto%2Bmurder|title=Vandiver's lifestyle led him to murder |publisher=The Palm Beach Post |date=February 10, 1977 |accessdate=August 7, 2014 |page=49}}{subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Vandiver was arrested in April 1973,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 314–317&lt;/ref&gt; but refused to cooperate with police until he was positively identified as the perpetrator by Hill's mother.&lt;ref name=Post-1977-02-10/&gt; When he confessed to the murder, he told police he had done it for financial gain.&lt;ref name=MJ-1980-11-24/&gt;&lt;ref name=Laredo-1999-03-19/&gt; During his confession, Vandiver  implicated McKittrick and Lilla Paulus, a former prostitute from Houston, as having been accessories to Hill's murder. He claimed that the shooting was a contract killing that he had been asked to carry out for $5,000.&lt;ref name=AP-1985-02-16/&gt;&lt;ref name=Post-1977-02-10/&gt; He told detectives "[Paulus] told me the contract was on a doctor who had killed his wife. And that it was the wife's father who was wanting him dead."&lt;ref name=Post-1977-02-10/&gt; During several days of police interrogation, Vandiver told Detectives Carpenter and Gamino that Lilla Paulus had first mentioned the contract in the summer of 1972, but that he had never intended to go through with it. He said that after he agreed to kill Hill, McKittrick telephoned Hill's office to arrange an appointment with the surgeon, but was told he was in Las Vegas. They subsequently traveled to Las Vegas to carry out the killing there, but could not find Hill, so they returned to Houston. After Vandiver killed the doctor at his home, he fled with McKittrick to [[Los Angeles]], where they shared an apartment for several months, but they frequently quarreled, and returned separately to Texas in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, 304–348&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 25, 1973, a grand jury voted to indict Vandiver and McKittrick for first degree murder, and indict Paulus as an accomplice to murder.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 331&lt;/ref&gt; Vandiver's trial was set for September 1973. In the meantime, District Attorney Bob Bennett arranged for him to live at a motel with his wife, Vicki. She had found a job as a waitress, but he was required to stay in his room unless accompanied by someone from the District Attorney's office. Vicki was in the process of seeking custody of her children from a previous marriage, and in June 1973, Vandiver asked Bennett if he could travel with her to [[Dallas]] while the case was heard. Bennett granted the request on the condition that Vandiver check in with him on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=Post-1977-02-11/&gt; Vandiver showed up as promised in September, only to learn that the trial had been postponed, and Bennett reluctantly allowed him to return to Dallas. The trial was eventually rescheduled for April 1974, but Vandiver failed to appear. He went on the run and moved to [[Longview, Texas]], adopting the alias J. C. Sheridan and trying to maintain a low profile. However, Longview police officer John Raymer grew suspicious of the newcomer to his town. After discovering the man's first name was actually Bobby, Raymer confronted Vandiver at a cafe one evening in May; Vandiver pulled a gun, and Raymer shot him dead.&lt;ref name=Post-1977-02-11&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson |first=Thomas |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/134015135/?terms=Third%2Bdeath%2Bgives%2BJoan%2BHill%2Bcase%2Banother%2Btwist |title=Third death gives Joan Hill case another twist |publisher=The Palm Beach Post |date=February 11, 1977 |accessdate=August 8, 2014 |pages=27, 30}}(subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, 344–355&lt;/ref&gt;

McKittrick remained at large for several months, but was finally arrested in Dallas on September 21, 1973, after attempting to cash a forged payroll check at a drive-in bank.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Under questioning, she corroborated Vandiver's story, and also told Carpenter and Gamino that she had met Ash Robinson while she was staying with Lilla Paulus in 1972. McKittrick claimed that Robinson had said he would do anything to get custody of his grandson, but that the only way that would happen was if Hill was dead. She said that Robinson and Paulus had met frequently at [[Ben Taub Hospital]], where money was handed over, and that Robinson had also visited Paulus at her home, where he gave her plans of Hill's home and $7,000 on the day of the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 343&lt;/ref&gt; McKittrick was scheduled to be tried in 1974, alongside Paulus. However, Paulus's lawyer, [[Dick DeGuerin]], argued for Vandiver's evidence to be dismissed under the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]], which gives a defendant the right to confront their accuser; the request was granted. DeGuerin also asked for McKittrick's evidence against Paulus to be ruled as inadmissible. But although this request was also granted, presiding Judge Price ruled that McKittrick's evidence could be used in the state's case against her. McKittrick's attorney, John Caperton, then sought consensus for her to enter a not guilty plea, but accept a guilty verdict, something to which Bennett agreed.&lt;ref name=Post-1977-02-11/&gt; McKittrick was convicted of being Vandiver's getaway driver&lt;ref name=Laredo-1999-03-19/&gt; and given a ten-year jail sentence.&lt;ref name=Advocate-1977-10-22/&gt; She was paroled after serving five years.&lt;ref name=Advocate-1982-05-27/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19860725&amp;id=EMMcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G1kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7061,6542662|title=Ex-convict McKittrick held on drunk charge|page=7A|date=July 25, 1986|publisher=The Victoria Advocate|accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trial and conviction of Lilla Paulus====
As McKittrick was led from the court, Bennett asked her to give evidence against Paulus, but she was initially reluctant to do so.&lt;ref name=Post-1977-02-11/&gt; She continued to resist until the case against Paulus was heard in February 1975.&lt;ref name=Post-1977-02-12&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson |first=Thomas |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/134015372/?terms=Ash%2BRobinson%27s%2Bname%2Bleft%2Buntainted%2Bafter%2Btrial |title=Ash Robinson's name left untainted after trial |publisher=The Palm Beach Post |date=February 12, 1977 |accessdate=August 9, 2014 |pages=20, 22–24}}(subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; At the trial, McKittrick testified that Robinson had paid Paulus $25,000 to find someone to eliminate Hill, and that in turn, Paulus had paid Vandiver $5,000 to carry out the murder. McKittrick and Robinson both passed [[polygraph test]]s.&lt;ref name=AP-1985-02-16/&gt; The results indicated that McKittrick was being truthful when she stated that Robinson had caused John Hill's death and that Robinson was telling the truth when he said he had nothing to do with Hill's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/3211/John-Hill-Trial-1971-Retrial-Unnecessary.html|title=John Hill Trial 1971-Retrial Unnecessary|publisher=Jrank.org|accessdate=August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett also produced evidence that Ash Robinson had taken out a private telephone number, which had been found written on a scrap of paper in Paulus's handbag.{{#tag:ref|The private telephone line was said to have been installed at the Robinson home on September 21, 1972-three days before the shooting death of John Hill.

She had sought to portray herself as a respectable widow who had taken pity on McKittrick. However, after telling the court that she did not know Vandiver, but had taken McKittrick into her home after a friend of her late husband had introduced them in the spring of 1972, Paulus offered comment on the difference between the two women's lifestyles. She told the court "I liked [McKittrick] even though you could gather from her conversation that her life was just a little bit different from mine".&lt;ref name=Post-1977-02-12/&gt;

Paulus claimed to know nothing of McKittrick's past, but Bennett thought her comparison of the two women's lifestyles was unusual if she was telling the truth. He knew that several years earlier she had been arrested on vagrancy and prostitution charges, and he sought a way to impeach her testimony. An officer who had arrested her, Lieutenant Allbright, then testified, casting doubt on her credibility, after which Bennett eventually persuaded Paulus's daughter, Mary Jo Wood, to give evidence against her. The relationship between mother and daughter had soured some years previously, after Paulus had disapproved of a man Wood was dating, attempted to have them both killed, then had her daughter confined to a mental hospital. Wood had escaped from the institution and fled with the man to another state, where the couple married, and she was afraid to return to Texas. She agreed to testify only after Bennett assured her that the District Attorney's office would ensure her protection while she was in Houston.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1976, pp. 377–440"&gt;Thompson 1976, pp. 377–440&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett introduced Mary Jo Wood as a surprise witness. She went on to testify that when Wood was a young girl, Paulus had owned several properties on Galveston's Post Office Street, a notorious [[red-light district]], that were operated as [[brothel]]s.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1976, pp. 377–440"/&gt; She also said that Paulus had accepted payment from a man who wished to perform a sexual act with Wood.&lt;ref name=Post-1977-02-12/&gt; Wood testified that she and her mother met Joan Robinson Hill through Diane Settegast around 1963. While at Robinson Hill's home, the women also met Ash Robinson. Wood said that she and her mother occasionally sat in the Robinson box at horse shows.  When Wood visited her mother in December 1970, she claimed she was told by Paulus of a call from Settegast, saying that Robinson wanted to hire someone to kill John Hill.&lt;ref name=Paulustrial&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/1982/57536-3.html|title=Paulus vs State|year=1981|publisher=Justia.com|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diane Settegast testified that she had known the Robinson family since 1952 and had met Paulus in 1957 or 1958. She denied telling Paulus that Ash Robinson wanted someone to kill his former son-in-law. Settegast, who had stayed at Paulus's home during the first murder trial for Hill, said she did have three telephone numbers for Ash Robinson; she believed she received the third number after the murder of John Hill and may have given the number in question to Paulus. She continued by saying that she had  seen Paulus in the company of Ash Robinson only once; it was at Chatsworth Farm during the 1968 holiday season.&lt;ref name=Paulustrial/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Joan Jaworski (Moncrief) Worrell, the daughter of prosecutor [[Leon Jaworski]], was also a long time friend of the Robinson family.  Worrell testified that she had seen Lilla Paulus and Ash Robinson together at Chatsworth Farm in 1965 and in 1969, before Robinson Hill's death.

In November 1980, ''[[CBS-TV]]'' reported that medical evidence had been reexamined, and that Hill's defense lawyer, [[Richard Haynes (criminal lawyer)|Richard Haynes]] was of the opinion that Joan Robinson Hill may have died as a result of [[toxic shock syndrome]], a condition associated with the use of [[tampon]]s.&lt;ref name=MJ-1980-11-24/&gt; But while Houston Medical Examiner Joseph Jachimscyk agreed that some of Robinson Hill's symptoms were indicative of toxic shock syndrome, he said that others were not, so would not change his original conclusion.&lt;ref name=MJ-1980-11-24/&gt;

==Cultural impact==

The events surrounding the death of Joan Robinson Hill have been the subject of several books, as well as a 1981 television film. Journalist and author Thomas Thompson's 1976 book ''Blood and Money'' provides a detailed account of the case. He became interested in the story while shadowing doctors in Houston as research for a previous book, ''Hearts'', about the world of cardiac surgery.&lt;ref name=People-1976-10-04/&gt; Ann Kurth filed a $3-million lawsuit against Thompson over his description of her as a "provocatively dressed, heavily made-up woman", but her action was dismissed by a jury in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] in March 1981, which decided that although derogatory, his description of her was accurate.&lt;ref name=sexbomb&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19821030&amp;id=bnhiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UXcNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2874,4586592|title='Celebrity' Author Dies of Cancer|publisher=Observer-Reporter Washington, PA|page=B-10|date=October 30, 1982|accessdate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal case was one of three Thompson faced over his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/10/us/woman-is-denied-award-in-libel-suit.html |title=Woman Is Denied Award In Libel Suit |publisher=The New York Times Company |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 10, 1981 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurth published her own account of the case entitled ''Prescription Murder'' in which she repeated her claim that Hill had tried to kill her, and alleged that he may have poisoned his first wife with bacteria-laced pastries.&lt;ref name=AP-1985-02-16/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Kurth further claimed that the suicide of Hill's brother, Julian, in 1963, was actually a murder by John Hill.

Buck also wrote that Hill was in financial difficulties with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] in 1972 and facing a murder case against him. Sightings of Hill had also been reported in Mexico and [[New York (city)|New York]].&lt;ref name=Advocate-1981-01-22/&gt;

The death of Robinson Hill was also the subject of a true crime television documentary-drama as part of the series ''[[Behind Mansion Walls]]'' from the [[Investigation Discovery]] television network. "The Thoroughbred Heiress" first aired in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2262629/?ref_=ttep_ep13|title=The Thoroughbred Heiress|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiology ==
When a stressful situation is encountered, stress hormones are released into the blood stream. [[Adrenaline]] is released by the [[adrenal glands]] to begin the response in the body. Adrenaline acts as a [[catalyst]] for the [[fight-or-flight response]],&lt;ref name="pendick"&gt;Pendick, D. (2002). Memory loss and the brain. Retrieved from http://www.memorylossonline.com/spring2002/stress.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which is a response of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] to encourage the body to react to the apparent stressor. This response causes an increase in heart-rate, blood pressure, and accelerated breathing. The kidneys release [[glucose]], providing energy to combat or flee the stressor.&lt;ref name="zieg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ziegler | first1 = D | last2 = Herman | first2 = J | year = 2002 | title = Neurocircuitry of stress integration: anatomical pathways regulating the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis of the rat | url = | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 541–551 | doi=10.1093/icb/42.3.541| pmid = 21708749 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood is redirected to the brain and major muscle groups, diverted away from energy consuming bodily functions unrelated to survival at the present time.&lt;ref name="pendick" /&gt; There are three important axes, the adrenocorticotropic axis, the vasopressin axis and the thyroxine axis, which are responsible for the physiologic response to stress.
[[File:Cortisol2.svg|thumb|Cortisol]]

=== Adrenocorticotropic hormone axis ===

When a receptor within the body senses a stressor, a signal is sent to the [[anterior hypothalamus]]. At the reception of the signal, [[corticotrophin-releasing factor]] (CRF) acts on the anterior pituitary. The [[anterior pituitary]] in turn releases [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH).&lt;ref name="viau"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Viau | first1 = V. | last2 = Soriano | first2 = L. | last3 = Dallman | first3 = M | year = 2001 | title = Androgens alter corticotropin releasing hormone and arginine vasopressin mrna within forebrain sites known to regulate activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroendocrinology | volume = 13 | issue = 5| pages = 442–452 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2826.2001.00653.x| pmid = 11328455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ant"&gt;Antoni F. Hypothalamic control of adrenocorticotropin secretion: advances since the discovery of 41-residue corticotropin-releasing factor" ''Endo Rev'' 1986; 7: 351 – 378.&lt;/ref&gt;  ACTH induces the release of [[corticosteriods]] and [[aldosterone]] from the adrenal gland. These substances are the main factors responsible for the stress response in humans. Cortisol for example stimulates the mobilization of [[Fatty acid#Free fatty acids|free fatty acids]] and proteins and the breakdown of [[amino acids]], and increases serum glucose level and blood pressure,&lt;ref name="zieg" /&gt; among other effects.&lt;ref name="cort"&gt;Talbott, S. (2007). The cortisol connection. Alameda, CA: Hunter House Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, aldosterone is responsible for water retention associated with stress. As a result of cells retaining sodium and eliminating [[potassium]], water is retained and blood pressure is increased by increasing the blood volume.

=== Vasopressin axis ===

A second physiological response in relation to stress occurs via the vasopressin axis. [[Vasopressin]], also known as [[antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH), is synthesized&lt;sup&gt;[''where, when and how?'']&lt;/sup&gt; and regulates fluid loss by manipulating the [[urinary tract]].&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scott | first1 = L | last2 = Dinan | first2 = T | year = 1998 | title = Vasopressin and the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function: implications for the pathophysiology of depression | url = | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 62 | issue = 22| pages = 1985–1998 | doi=10.1016/s0024-3205(98)00027-7| pmid = 9627097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pathway allows water reabsorption within the body and decreases the amount of water lost through perspiration. ADH has the greatest&lt;sup&gt;[''greatest among what?'']&lt;/sup&gt; effect on blood pressure within the body. Under normal circumstances, ADH will regulate the blood pressure and increase or decrease the blood volume when needed.&lt;ref name="zieg" /&gt; However, when stress becomes chronic, [[homeostatic]] regulation of blood pressure is lost. Vasopressin is released and causes a static increase in blood pressure. This increase in blood pressure under stressful conditions ensures that muscles receive the oxygen that they need to be active and respond accordingly.&lt;ref name="scott" /&gt; If these stressful conditions remain elevated, muscles will become fatigued, resulting in [[hypertension]] and in extreme cases can result in death.

=== Thyroxine axis ===

The third physiological response results in the release of [[Thyrotropin-releasing hormone|thyrotropic hormone-release factor]] (TRF)&lt;sup&gt;[''Where, when and how?'']&lt;/sup&gt; which results in the release of thyrotropic hormone (TTH).&lt;ref name="prange"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prange | first1 = A | year = 1999 | title = Thyroid axis sustaining hypothesis of posttraumatic stress disorder | url = | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 61 | issue = 2| pages = 139–140 | doi=10.1097/00006842-199903000-00002| pmid = 10204963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  TTH stimulates the release of [[thyroxine]] and [[triiodothyronine]] from the [[thyroid]].&lt;ref name="prange" /&gt;  This results in an increased [[basal metabolic rate]] (BMR).&lt;sup&gt;[''What effect does that have?'']&lt;/sup&gt; This effect is not as immediate as the other two, and can take days to weeks to become prevalent.

== Chronic stress ==
'''Chronic stress''' is a stressor that is ongoing for a long period of time. When [[chronic stress]] is experienced, our body is in a state of continuous physiological arousal.&lt;ref name="pasquali"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pasquali | first1 = R | year = 2006 | title = The Biological Balance between Psychological Well-Being and Distress: A Clinician's Point of View | url = | journal = Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics | volume = 75 | issue = 2| pages = 69–71 | doi=10.1159/000090890| pmid = 16508341 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, our body activates our fight-or-flight-response, and when the perceived stress is over our body returns to a state of [[homeostasis]]. When chronic stress is perceived, however, the body is in a continuous state of fight-or-flight response and never reaches a state of homeostasis. The physiological effects of chronic stress can negatively affect memory and learning.&lt;ref name="pasquali" /&gt; One study used rats to show the effects of chronic stress on memory by exposing them to a cat for five weeks and being randomly assigned to a different group each day.&lt;ref name="parkhad"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parkad | first1 = C.R. | last2 = Campbella | first2 = A.M. | last3 = Diamond | first3 = D.M. | year = 2001 | title = Chronic psychosocial stress impairs learning and memory and increases sensitivity to yohimbine in adult rats | url = | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 50 | issue = 12| pages = 994–1004 | doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(01)01255-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their stress was measured in a naturalistic setting by observing their open field behaviour, and the effect on memory was estimated using the [[radial arm maze|radial arm water maze]] (RAWM).  In the RAWM, rats are taught the place of a platform that is placed below the surface of the water. They must recall this later to discover the platform to exit the water.  It was found that the rats exposed to chronic psychosocial stress could not learn to adapt to new situations and environments, and had impaired memory on the RAWM.&lt;ref name="parkhad" /&gt;

Chronic stress affects a person's cognitive functioning differently for normal subjects versus subjects with mild cognitive impairment.{{clarify|date=January 2014}} Chronic stress and elevated cortisol (a biomarker for stress) has been known to lead to dementia in elderly people.&lt;ref name="Henckens 10111–10119" /&gt;  A longitudinal study was performed which included 61 cognitively normal people and 41 people who suffered from mild cognitive impairment.  The participants were between 65 and 97 years old. 52 of the participants were followed for three years and repeatedly received stress and cognitive test assessments. Any patient that suffered from signs or conditions that would affect their cortisol level or cognitive functioning was exempt from participating.&lt;ref name="Peavy 1384–1391" /&gt;

In general, higher event based stress was associated with more rapid cognitive impairment. However, participants with greater cortisol levels showed signs of slower decline. Neither of these effects held for the non-cognitively-impaired group.&lt;ref name="Peavy 1384–1391" /&gt;

== Acute stress ==
'''Acute stress''' is a [[stressor]] that is an immediate perceived threat.&lt;ref name="neupert"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neupert | first1 = S.D. | last2 = Almeida | first2 = D.M. | last3 = Mroczek | first3 = D.K. | last4 = Spiro | first4 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Daily Stressors and Memory Failure in a Naturalistic Setting: Findings from the VA Normative Aging Study | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 424–429 | doi=10.1037/0882-7974.21.2.424| pmid = 16768588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike chronic stress, acute stress is not ongoing and the physiological arousal associated with acute stress is not nearly as demanding. There are mixed findings on the effects of acute stress on memory. One view is that acute stress can impair memory, while others believe that acute stress can actually enhance memory.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Several studies have shown that stress and glucocorticoids enhance memory formation while they impair memory retrieval.&lt;ref name="Quervain 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Quervain | first1 = De | display-authors = etal   | year = 2009 | title = Glucocorticoids and the regulation of memory in health and disease | url = | journal = Front Neuroendocrinol | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 358–70 | doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2009.03.002| pmid = 19341764 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For acute stress to enhance memory certain circumstances must be met. First, the context in which the stress is being perceived must match the context of the information or material being encoded.&lt;ref name="smeets"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smeets | first1 = T. | last2 = Giesbrecht | first2 = T. | last3 = Jelicic | first3 = M. | last4 = Merckelbach | first4 = H. | year = 2007 | title = Context-dependent enhancement of declarative memory performance following acute psychosocial stress | url = | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 1–2| pages = 116–123 | doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2007.07.001| pmid = 17689852 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=January 2014}} Second, the brain regions involved in the retrieval of the memory must match the regions targeted by glucocorticoids.&lt;ref name="smeets" /&gt; There are also differences in the type of information being remembered or being forgotten while being exposed to acute stress. In some cases neutral stimuli tend to be remembered, while emotionally charged ([[Salience (neuroscience)|salient]]) stimuli tend to be forgotten. In other cases the opposite effect is obtained.&lt;ref name="jelicic"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jelicic | first1 = M. | last2 = Geraerts | first2 = E. | last3 = Merckelbach | first3 = H. | last4 = Guerrieri | first4 = R. | year = 2004 | title = Acute Stress Enhances Memory For Emotional Words, But Impairs Memory For Neutral Words | url = | journal = International Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 114 | issue = 10| pages = 1343–1351 | doi=10.1080/00207450490476101| pmid = 15370191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; What seems to be an important factor in determining what will be impaired and what will be enhanced is the timing of the perceived stressful exposure and the timing of the retrieval.&lt;ref name="smeets" /&gt; For emotionally salient information to be remembered, the perceived stress must be induced before encoding, and retrieval must follow shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="smeets" /&gt; In contrast, for emotionally charged stimuli to be forgotten, the stressful exposure must be after encoding and retrieval must follow after a longer delay.&lt;ref name="smeets" /&gt;

If stressful information is relatable to a person, the event more prone to be stored in permanent memory.  When a person is under stress, the sympathetic system will shift to a constantly (tonically) active state. To further study how acute stress affect memory formation, a study would appropriate to add examine.{{clarify|date=January 2014}}&lt;ref name="jourhenk" /&gt; Acute stress exposure induces the activation of different hormonal and neurotransmitters which effect the memory's working processes.&lt;ref name=Roozendaal&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Roozendaal B, McEwen BS, Chattarji S |title=Stress, memory and the amygdala.|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience  |date=June 2009|volume=10|issue=6|pages=423–33|doi=10.1038/nrn2651|pmid=19469026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2009 tested eighteen young healthy males between 19 and 31 years old. All participants were right-handed and had no history of a head injury, or of any medication that could affect a person [[central nervous system]] or [[endocrine system]].  All of the volunteers participated in two different sessions a month apart.  The study consisted on the participants viewing movie clips and pictures that belonged to two different categories: neutral or negative. The participants had to memorize then rate each movie clip or picture by pressing a button with their right hand. They were also monitored in other areas such as their heart rate, pupil diameter, and stress measures by collection of saliva throughout the experiment. The participants mood was assessed by using the [[Affect measures|Positive and Negative Affect Schedule]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal

The results from the study confirmed that there were physiological measures in regard to stress induction. The participant's heart rate was elevated and pupil dilation was decreased when viewing the pictures. The study also showed psychological measures that proved that stress induction did cause an increase in subjective stress. In regard to memory enhancement, participants that were shown a stressful picture, often remembered them a day later, which is in accordance with the theory that negative incidents have lasting effects on our memory.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Acute stress can also affect a person's [[neural correlates]] which interfere with the memory formation. During a stressful time, a person's attention and emotional state may be affected, which could hinder the ability to focus while processing an image. Stress can also enhance the neural state of memory formation.{{clarify|date=January 2014}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

== Short-term memory ==
{{Main|Short-term memory}}
'''Short-term memory''' (STM) is the ability to store small amounts of information for a limited amount of time. The ''[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|Miller's Law]]'' that the capacity of an average person's [[Short-term memory|STM]] is 7±2 objects, and lasts for a matter of seconds.&lt;ref name="text" /&gt; This means that when given a series of items to remember, most people can remember 5-9 of those items, the average being 7. However, this limit can be increased by [[Memory rehearsal|rehearsing]] the information. Information in STM can be transferred to long-term memory (LTM) by rehearsal and association with other information previously stored in LTM.
Most of the research on stress and memory has been done on working memory (WM), as opposed to STM.

== Working memory ==
[[File:Working-memory-en.svg|thumb|[[Baddeley's model of working memory]]]]
'''Working memory''' (WM), similar to STM, is the ability to temporarily store information in order to manipulate it for performing complex tasks, such as reasoning.
[[Working memory|WM]] is affected to a greater extent by stress than LTM.&lt;ref name="Ohare"&gt;O'Hare, D. (1999). Human performance in general aviation. Aldershot, England: Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt; Stress has been shown to both improve and impair WM. In a study by Duncko ''et al.'', the positive effect of stress manifested itself as a decreased [[reaction time]] in participants, while the negative effect of stress causes more false alarms and mistakes when compared to a normal condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duncko | first1 = R. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = L. | last3 = Merikangas | first3 = K. | last4 = Grillon | first4 = C. | year = 2009 | title = Working memory performance after acute exposure to the cold pressor stress in healthy volunteers | url = | journal = Neurobiology of Learning and Memory | volume = 91 | issue = 4| pages = 377–381 | doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2009.01.006| pmid = 19340949 | pmc=2696884}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers hypothesize that this could be representative of faster [[information processing]], something helpful in a threatening situation. [[Anxiety]] has also been shown to adversely affect some of the components of WM, those being the [[phonological loop]], the [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Visuospatial sketchpad|visuo-spatial sketchpad]], and the [[central executive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = J. H. | year = 1999 | title = Test anxiety and working memory | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Education | volume = 67 | issue = 3| pages = 218–225 | doi=10.1080/00220979909598354}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phonological loop is used for [[echoic memory|auditory]] STM, the visuo-spatial sketchpad is used for [[visual memory|visual]] and [[spatial memory|spatial]] STM, and the central executive links and controls these systems.&lt;ref name="text" /&gt; The disruption of these components impairs the transfer of information from WM to LTM, thus affecting learning. For instance, several studies have demonstrated that acute stress can impair working memory processing likely though reduced neural activity in the prefrontal cortex in both monkeys and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.368.5822&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|pmc=3350069|year=2009|author1=Qin|first1=S|title=The effect of moderate acute psychological stress on working memory-related neural activity is modulated by a genetic variation in catecholaminergic function in humans|journal=Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience|volume=6|pages=16|last2=Cousijn|first2=H|last3=Rijpkema|first3=M|last4=Luo|first4=J|last5=Franke|first5=B|last6=Hermans|first6=E. J.|last7=Fernández|first7=G|doi=10.3389/fnint.2012.00016|pmid=22593737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Long-term memory ==
'''Long-term memory''' (LTM) is the ability to store an unlimited{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} amount of information over long periods of time, ranging from a few days to many years.

Less is known about the effect of stress on [[Long-term memory|LTM]] than is known about the effect of stress on STM. This could be due to the fact that LTM is not affected as severely as STM and WM are, and is also influenced by the effect of stress on STM and WM.&lt;ref name="Ohare" /&gt;

The major effect of stress on LTM is that it improves [[Memory consolidation|consolidation]] of memory, while it impairs the retrieval of memory.&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature Neuroscience" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quervain 2009" /&gt; That is, one will be able to remember information relating to a stressful situation after the fact, but while in a stressful situation it is hard to recall specific information. In a study by Park ''et al.'' done on rats, the researchers found that shock induced stress caused the rats to forget what they learned in the phase prior to the shock, but to have distinct memory for where the shock occurred.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Park | first1 = C. R. | last2 = Zoladz | first2 = P. R. | last3 = Conrad | first3 = C.

A study by Marin ''et al.'' demonstrated that stress enhances recall of information reviewed prior to the stressful situation, and that this effect is long lasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marin | first1 = M. | last2 = Pilgrim | first2 = K. | last3 = Lupien | first3 = S. J. | year = 2010 | title = Modulatory effects of stress on reactivated emotional memories | url = | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 35 | issue = 9| pages = 1388–1396 | doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.04.002| pmid = 20471179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Explicit memory ===
[[File:Hippocampus.png|thumb|The human hippocampus]]
[[Explicit memory]], or [[declarative memory]], is the intentional recall of past events or learned information and is a discipline of LTM.&lt;ref name="text" /&gt; Explicit memory includes memory for remembering a specific event, such as dinner the week prior, or information about the world, such as the definition for explicit memory. When an anxious state is provoked, percentage recall on explicit memory tasks is enhanced. However, this effect is only present for emotionally associated words.&lt;ref name="ex"&gt;Schwabe, L., Romer, S., Richter, S., Bilak, B. &amp; Schachinger, H. (2009). Stress effects on declarative memory retrieval are blocked by B-andrenoceptor anatagonist in humans. Psychoneuroendocrinology: 34, 446-454.&lt;/ref&gt; Stress hormones influence the processes carried out in the hippocampus and amygdala which are also associated with emotional responses.&lt;ref name="ex" /&gt; Thus, emotional memories are enhanced when stress is induced, as they are both associated with the same areas of the brain, whereas neutral stimuli and stress are not. However, enhancement of explicit memory depends on the time of day.&lt;ref name="ex" /&gt; Explicit memory is enhanced by stress when assessed in the afternoon, but impaired when assessed in the morning.&lt;ref name="ex" /&gt; Basal cortisol levels are relatively low in the afternoon and much higher in the morning, which can alter the interaction and effects of stress hormones.&lt;ref name="ex" /&gt;

=== Implicit memory ===
[[Implicit memory]], or more precisely [[procedural memory]], is memory of information without conscious awareness or ability to verbalize the process, and is also a discipline of LTM.&lt;ref name="text" /&gt; There are three types of implicit memory, which are: conditioning (emotional behavior), tasks and priming (verbal behavior).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bremner | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Krystal | first2 = J.H | last3 = Southwick | first3 = S.M. | last4 = Charney | first4 = D.S. | year = 1995 | title = Functional neuroanatomical correlates of the effects of stress on memory | url = | journal = Journal of Traumatic Stress | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 527–553 | doi=10.1007/bf02102888 | pmid=8564272}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the process of riding a bicycle cannot be verbalized, but the action can still be executed. When [[implicit memory]] is assessed in tandem with stressful cues there is no change in procedural recall.&lt;ref name="ex" /&gt;

== Autobiographical memory ==
[[Autobiographical memory]] is personal [[episodic memory]] of self-related information and specific events.&lt;ref name="text"&gt;Baddeley, A., Eysenck, M. W. &amp; Anderson, M. C. (2010). Memory. Psychology Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Stress tends to impair the accuracy of [[autobiographical memory|autobiographical memories]], but does not impair the [[frequency]] or [[confidence]] in them.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Moradi, A. R., Herlihy, J., Yasseri, G., Shahraray, M., Turner, S. &amp; Dalgleish, T. (2008). Specifically of episodic memory and semantic memory aspects of autobiographical memory in relation to symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder. Science Direct: 127, 645-653.&lt;/ref&gt; After exposure to an emotional and stressful negative event, flashback memories can be evident.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; However, the more flashback memories present, the less accurate the autobiographical memory.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Both aspects of autobiographical memory, [[episodic memory]], the memory system regarding specific events, and [[semantic memory]], the memory system regarding general information about the world, are impaired by an event that induces a stressful response.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; This causes the recall of an experience of a specific event and the information about the event to be recalled less accurately.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

Autobiographical memory, however, is not impaired on a continual decline from the first recall of the information when anxiety is induced.&lt;ref name="SCH"&gt;Schwabe, L. &amp; Wolf, O.T. (2010). Stress impairs the re-consolidation of autobiographical memories. Neurology of Learning and Memory: 94, 153-157.&lt;/ref&gt; At first recall attempt, the memory is fairly accurate.&lt;ref name="SCH" /&gt; The impairment begins when reconsolidation is present,&lt;ref name="SCH" /&gt; such that the more times the memory is brought to conscious awareness, the less accurate it will become. When stress is induced the memory will be susceptible to other influences,&lt;ref name="SCH" /&gt; such as suggestions from other people, or emotions unrelated to the event but present during recall. Therefore, stress at the encoding of an event positively influences memory, but stress at the time of recollection impairs memory.

== Attention ==

'''Attention''' is the process by which a concentration is focused on a point of interest, such as an event or physical stimulus. It is theorized that [[attention]] toward a stimulus will increase ability to recall information, therefore enhancing memory.&lt;ref name="Daleiden"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Daleiden | first1 = L | year = 1998 | title = Childhood anxiety and memory functioning: a comparison of systematic and processing accounts | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology: | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 216–235 | doi=10.1006/jecp.1997.2429}}&lt;/ref&gt; When threatening information or a stimulus that provokes anxiety are present, it is difficult to release attention from the negative cue.&lt;ref name="Daleiden" /&gt; When in a state of high anxiety, a conceptual [[memory bias]] is produced toward the negative stimulus.&lt;ref name="Daleiden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Derrberry"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Derryberry | first1 = D. | last2 = Reed | first2 = M. A. | year = 1994 | title = Temperament and attention: Orienting toward and away from positive and negative signals | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 66 | issue = 6| pages = 1128–1130 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.6.1128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is difficult to redirect the attention focus away from the negative, anxiety provoking cue.&lt;ref name="Derrberry" /&gt; This increases the [[activation]] of the pathways associated with the threatening cues, and thus increases the ability to recall the information present while in a high anxious state.&lt;ref name="Daleiden" /&gt; However, when in a high anxious state and presented with positive information, there is no memory bias produced.&lt;ref name="Daleiden" /&gt; This occurs because it is not as difficult to redirect attention from the positive stimulus as it is from the negative stimulus. This is due to the fact that the negative cue is perceived as a factor in the induced stress, whereas the positive cue is not.&lt;ref name="Daleiden" /&gt;

== Learning ==

'''Learning''' is the modification of behaviour by experience.&lt;ref&gt;Gaulin, S. J. C. &amp; McBurney, D. H. (2004). Evolutionary Psychology. Pearson: New Jersey, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[learning]] to avoid certain stimuli such as a tornadoes, thunderstorms, large animals, and toxic chemicals, because they can be harmful.  This is classified as [[aversion therapy|aversion conditioning]], and is related to fear responses.&lt;ref name="Learning"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vriends | first1 = N. | last2 = Michael | first2 = T. | last3 = Blechert | first3 = J. | last4 = Meyer | first4 = A.H. | last5 = Marhraf | first5 = J. | last6 = Wilhelm | first6 = F. H. | year = 2011 | title = The influence of state anxiety on the acquisition and extinction of fear | url = | journal = Journal of Behavioural Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry: | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 46–53 | doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2010.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fear response ===

An anxious state at the time of learning can create a stronger aversion to the stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zinbarg | first1 = R. E. | last2 = Mohlman | first2 = J. | year = 1998 | title = Individual differences in the acquisition of affectivity valenced associations | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychiatry | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 1024–1040 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.4.1024}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger aversion can lead to stronger associations in memory between the stimulus and response, therefore enhancing the memory of the response to the stimulus.&lt;ref name="Learning" /&gt; When [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]] is attempted in male and female humans, compared to a neutral control without anxiety, extinction does not occur.&lt;ref name="Learning" /&gt; This suggests that memory is enhanced for learning, specifically fear learning, when anxiety is present.

=== Reversal learning ===
Conversely, reversal learning&lt;sup&gt;[''What is it?'']&lt;/sup&gt; is inhibited by the presence of anxiety.&lt;ref name="First"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dickstein | first1 = D.P. | last2 = Finger | first2 = E.C. | last3 = Brotman | first3 = B.A. | last4 = Rich | first4 = D.S. | last5 = Blair | first5 = J.R. | last6 = Leibenloft | first6 = E.L. | year = 2010 | title = Impaired probabilistic reversal learning in youths with mood and anxiety disorders | url = | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 7| pages = 1089–1100 | doi=10.1017/s0033291709991462| pmid = 19818204 | pmc=3000432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Second"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blair | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Cipolotti | first2 = L. | year = 2000 | title = Impaired social responses.

Much of the research relating to stress and memory has been conducted on animals and can be generalized to humans.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} One type of stress that is not easily translatable to humans is predator stress: the anxiety an animal experiences when in the presence of a [[predator]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In studies, stress is induced by introducing a predator to a subject either before the learning phase or between the learning phase and the testing phase. Memory is measured by various tests, such as the [[radial arm maze|radial arm water maze]] (RAWM). In the RAWM, rats are taught the location of a hidden platform and must recall this information later on to find the platform and get out of the water.

=== Short-term memory ===

Predator Stress has been shown to impair STM.&lt;ref name="Park" /&gt; It has been determined that this effect on STM is not due to the fact that a predator is a novel and arousing stimulus, but rather because of the fear that is provoked in the test subjects by the predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodson | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Macintosh | first2 = D. | last3 = Flesner | first3 = M. | last4 = Diamond | first4 = D. M. | year = 2003 | title = Emotion-Induced Amnesia in Rats: Working Memory-Specific Impairment, Corticosterone-Memory Correlation, and Fear Versus Arousal Effects on Memory | url = | journal = Learning and Memory | volume = 10 | issue = 5| pages = 326–336 | doi=10.1101/lm.62903| pmid = 14557605 | pmc=217998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long-term memory ===

Predator stress has been shown to increase LTM. In a study done by Sundata ''et al.'' on snails, it was shown that when trained in the presence of a predator, snails' memory persisted for at least 24 hours in adults, while it usually lasts only 3 hours. Juvenile snails, who usually do not have any LTM showed signs of LTM after exposure to a predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sundada | first1 = H. | last2 = Horikoshi | first2 = T. | last3 = Lukawiak | first3 = K. | last4 = Sakakibara | first4 = M. | year = 2010 | title = Increase in excitability of RPeD11 results in memory enhancement of juvenile and adult Lymnaea stagnalis by predator-induced stress | url = | journal = Neurobiology of Learning and Memory | volume = 94 | issue = 2| pages = 269–277 | doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2010.06.005| pmid = 20601028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classical conditioning ===

Predator stress has been shown to improve [[classical conditioning]] in males and hinder it in females. A study done by Maeng ''et al.'' demonstrated that stress allowed faster classical conditioning of male rats while disrupting the same type of learning in female rats.&lt;ref name="Maeng"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maeng | first1 = L. Y. | last2 = Waddell | first2 = J. | last3 = Shors | first3 = T. J. | year = 2010 | title = The Prefrontal Cortex Communicates with the Amygdala to Impair Learning after Acute Stress in Females but Not in Males | url = | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 30 | issue = 48| pages = 16188–16196 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.2265-10.2010| pmid = 21123565 | pmc=3073607}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gender differences were shown to be caused by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). When the researchers inactivated that brain region by administering [[muscimol]] to the females, no gender differences in classical conditioning were observed 24 hours later.&lt;ref name="Maeng" /&gt; Inactivating the mPFC in the male rats did not prevent the enhanced conditioning that the males previously exhibited.&lt;ref name="Maeng" /&gt; This discrepancy between genders has also been shown to be present in humans. In a 2005 study, Jackson ''et al.'' reported that stress enhanced classical conditioning in human males and impaired classical condition in human females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = E.D. | last2 = Payne | first2 = J.D. | last3 = Nadel | first3 = L. | last4 = Jacobs | first4 = W.J. | year = 2005 | title = Stress differentially modulates fear conditioning in healthy men and women | url = | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 59 | issue = 6| pages = 516–522 | doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.08.002| pmid = 16213468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anxiety disorders ==

=== Post-traumatic stress disorder ===

[[Post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) is an [[anxiety disorder]] that can occur after exposure to horrific events, or after a terrifying ordeal where there is immense physical harm that directly or indirectly affects a person.&lt;ref name="nimhptsd"&gt;National Institute of Mental Health, . (2011). Post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). Retrieved from http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; When the memories of these traumas do not subside, a person may begin to avoid anything that would cause them to relive these events. When this persists over an extended period of time, one may be said to be suffering from PTSD. Examples of events that could lead to the onset of PTSD are war, rape, assault, and childhood neglect.&lt;ref name="allianceptsd"&gt;PTSD Alliance, Initials. (2001). Post traumatic stress disorder. Retrieved from http://www.ptsdalliance.org/about_symp.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayoptsd"&gt;Mayo Clinic Staff, . (2009). Post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) . Retrieved from http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/DS00246&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that approximately 8% of American may suffer from this disease which can lead to long-term problems.&lt;ref name="Bremner 523–538"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bremner|first=J. Douglas|title=Neuroimaging in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Other Stress-Related Disorders|journal=Neuroimaging Clinics of North America|date=1 November 2007|volume=17|issue=4|pages=523–538|doi=10.1016/J.NIC.2007.07.003|pmid=17983968|pmc=2729089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shellshock2.jpg|thumb|Shell shocked soldiers]]

Symptoms include persistent frightened thoughts and memories of the trauma or ordeal and emotional numbness.&lt;ref name="nimhptsd" /&gt; The individual may experience sleeping problems, be easily startled, or experience feelings of detachment or numbness. Sufferers may experience depression and/or display self-destructive behaviours.

There are three categories of symptoms associated with PTSD:&lt;ref name="allianceptsd" /&gt;
* ''Re-living the event'': Through recurring nightmares or images that bring back memories of the events. When people re-live the event they become panicked, and they may have physical and emotional chills or heart palpitations.
* ''Avoiding reminders'': Avoiding reminders of the events, including places, people, thoughts or other activities relating to the specific event. Withdrawal from family and friends and loss of interest in activities may occur from PTSD
* ''Being on guard'': Symptoms also include an inability to relax, feelings of irritability or sudden anger, sleeping problems, and being easily startled.

The most effective treatments for PTSD are [[psychotherapy]], medication, and in some circumstance both.&lt;ref name="Mayoptsd" /&gt; Effective psychotherapy involves helping the individual with managing the symptoms, coping with the traumatic event, and working through the traumatic experiences. Medications such as antidepressants has proven to be an effective way to block the effects of stress and to also promote neurogenesis.&lt;ref name="Sandi 1–20" /&gt;  The medication phenytoin can also block stress caused to the hippocampus with the help of modulation of excitatory amino acids.&lt;ref name="Bremner 523–538" /&gt; Preliminary findings indicate that cortisol may be helpful to reduce traumatic memory in PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aerni | first1 = A | last2 = Traber | first2 = R | last3 = Hock | first3 = C | last4 = Roozendaal | first4 = B | last5 = Schelling | first5 = G | last6 = Papassotiropoulos | first6 = A | last7 = Nitsch | first7 = RM | last8 = Schnyder | first8 = U | last9 = de Quervain | first9 = DJ | year = 2004 | title = Low-dose cortisol for symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder | url = | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 161 | issue = 8| pages = 1488–90 | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.8.1488| pmid = 15285979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PTSD affects memory recall and accuracy.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; The more the traumatic event is brought to conscious awareness and recalled, the less accurate the memory.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; PTSD affects the verbal memory of the traumatic event, but does not affect the memory in general.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; One of the ways traumatic stress affects individuals is that the traumatic event tends to disrupt the stream of memories people obtain through life, creating memories that do not blend in with the rest. This has the effect of creating a split in identity as the person now has good memories they can attribute to one personality and bad memories the can attribute to the "other" personality. For example, a victim of childhood abuse can group their good and happy experiences under the "pleasant" personality and their abuse experiences under one "bad or wicked" personality. This then creates a split personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bremner | first1 = J. Douglas | last2 = Krystal | first2 = John H. | last3 = Southwick | first3 = Steven M. | last4 = Charney | first4 = Dennis S. | year = 1995| title = Functional Neuroanatomical Correlates of the Effects of Stress on Memory | journal = Journal of Traumatic Stress | volume = 8 | issue = 4| page = 1995 | doi=10.1007/bf02102888 | pmid=8564272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals suffering from post traumatic stress disorder often have difficulty remembering facts, appointments and autobiographical details.&lt;ref name="mora"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moradi | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Doost | first2 = H. T. N. | last3 = Taghavi | first3 = M. R. | last4 = Yule | first4 = W. | last5 = Dalgleish | first5 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Everyday memory deficits in children and adolescents with ptsd: performance on the rivermead behavioural memory test | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 357–361 | doi=10.1111/1469-7610.00453| pmid = 10190337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The traumatic event can result in [[psychogenic amnesia]] and in the occurrence of intrusive recollections of the event. Children with PTSD have deficits in cognitive processes essential for learning; their memory systems also under-performs those of normal children.  A study using the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test showed that individuals with PTSD scored lower than controls on the memory test, indicating a poorer general knowledge. The study revealed that 78% of PTSD patients under-performed, and where in the categories labelled "poor memory" or "impaired memory".&lt;ref name="mora" /&gt;  PTSD patients were specifically worse at the prospective and orientation items on the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test.

A few studies done in the past proved that PTSD can cause cognition and brain structure changes that involve verbal declarative memory deficits.  Children that have experienced child abuse may according to neuropsychological testing experience a deficit in verbal declarative memory functioning.&lt;ref name="Bremner 523–538" /&gt;

Studies have been conducted on people that were involved in the Vietnam War or the Holocaust, returning Iraq soldiers and people that also suffered from rape and childhood abuse. Different tests were administered such as the Selective Reminding Test, Verbal Learning Test, Paired Associate Recall, the California Verbal New Learning Test, and the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test.&lt;ref name="Bremner 523–538" /&gt;  The test results showed that the returning Iraq soldiers did have less verbal memory performance as compared to pre-deployment.&lt;ref name="Bremner 523–538" /&gt;

The studies performed on the Vietnam veterans that suffer from PTSD show that there are hippocampal changes in the brain associated with this disorder.  The veterans with PTSD showed an 8% reduction in their right hippocampal volume.  The patients that suffered from child abuse showed a 12% reduction in their mean left hippocampal volume.&lt;ref name="Bremner 523–538" /&gt; Several of the studies has also shown that people with PTSD have deficits while performing verbal declarative memory task in their hippicampal.&lt;ref name="Bremner 523–538" /&gt;

PTSD can affect several parts of the brain such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex. The amygdala controls our memory and emotional processing; the hippocampus helps with organizing, storing and memory forming.  Hippocampus is the most sensitive area to stress.&lt;ref name="Bremner 523–538" /&gt; The prefrontal cortex helps with our expression and personality and helps regulate complex cognitive and our behavior functions.

=== Social anxiety disorder ===
[[Social anxiety disorder]] is an anxiety disorder consisting of overwhelming anxiety and excessive self-consciousness in everyday social situations.&lt;ref name="nimhSocial"&gt;National Institute of Mental Health, . (2011). Social phobia (social anxiety disorder). Retrieved from http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/social-phobia-social-anxiety-disorder/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; It is an extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social and/or performance situations. This fear about a situation can become so severe that it affects work, school, and other typical activities.&lt;ref name="adaa"&gt;Anxiety disorders association of america, Initials. (2010). Social anxiety disorder. Retrieved from http://www.adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/social-anxiety-disorder&lt;/ref&gt; Social anxiety can be related to one situation (such as talking to people) or it can be much more broad, where a person experiences anxiety around everyone except family members.

People with social anxiety disorder have a constant, chronic fear of being watched and judged by peers and strangers, and of doing something that will embarrass them. People that suffer from this may physically feel sick from the situation, even when the situation is non-threatening.&lt;ref name="adaa" /&gt; Physical symptoms of the disorder include blushing, profuse sweating, trembling, nausea or abdominal distress, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness, headaches, and feelings of detachment. Development of low self-esteem, poor social skills, and trouble being assertive are also common signs of social anxiety disorder.&lt;ref name="Mayosocial"&gt;Mayo Clinic Staff, . (2009). Social anxiety disorder (social phobia). Retrieved from http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/social-anxiety-disorder/DS00595&lt;/ref&gt;

Social anxiety disorder can be treated with many different types of therapy and medication. [[Exposure therapy]] is an effective method of treating social anxiety. In exposure therapy a patient is presented with situations that they are afraid of, gradually building up to facing the situation that the patient fears most.&lt;ref name="Mayosocial" /&gt; This type of therapy helps the patient learn new techniques to cope with different situations that they fear. Role-playing has proven effective for the treatment or social anxiety. Role-playing therapy helps to boost individuals' confidence relating to other people and helps increase social skills. Medication is another effective method for treating social anxiety. [[Antidepressant]]s, [[beta blockers]], and [[anti-anxiety]] medications are the most commonly prescribed types of medication to treat social anxiety.&lt;ref name="Mayosocial" /&gt; Moreover, there are new approaches to treat phobias and enhance exposure therapy with glucocorticoids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Soravia | first1 = LM | last2 = Heinrichs | first2 = M | last3 = Aerni | first3 = A | last4 = Maroni | first4 = C | last5 = Schelling | first5 = G | last6 = Ehlert | first6 = U | last7 = Roozendaal | first7 = B | last8 = de Quervain | first8 = DJ | year = 2006 | title = Glucocorticoids reduce phobic fear in humans | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 103 | issue = 14| pages = 5585–90 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0509184103| pmid = 16567641 | pmc=1414637}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Quervain | first1 = DJ | last2 = Bentz | first2 = D | last3 = Michael | first3 = T | last4 = Bolt | first4 = OC | last5 = Wiederhold | first5 = BK | last6 = Margraf | first6 = J | last7 = Wilhelm | first7 = FH | year = 2011 | title = Glucocorticoids enhance extinction-based psychotherapy | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 108 | issue = 16| pages = 6621–5 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1018214108| pmid = 21444799 | pmc=3081033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social phobics display a tendency to recall negative emotions about a situation when asked to recall the event.&lt;ref name="mell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mellings | first1 = T. M. B. | last2 = Alden | first2 = L. E. | year = 2000 | title = Cognitive processes in social anxiety: the effects of self- focus, rumination and anticipatory processing  | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 38 | issue = 3| pages = 243–257 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7967(99)00040-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their emotions typically revolve around themselves, with no recollection of other people's environments. Social anxiety results in negative aspects of the event to be remembered, leading to a biased opinion of the situation from the perspective of the social phobic compared to the non-social phobic.&lt;ref name="mell" /&gt; Social phobics typically displayed better recall than control participants. However, individuals with social anxiety recalled angry faces rather than happy or neutral faces better than control participants.&lt;ref name="amado"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stravynski | first1 = A. | last2 = Bond | first2 = S. | last3 = Amado | first3 = D. | year = 2004 | title = Cognitive causes of social phobia: a critical appraisal | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 421–440 | doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2004.01.006| pmid = 15245829 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obsessive-compulsive disorder ===
[[Obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD) involves both obsessions and compulsions that disrupt daily routines and activities.&lt;ref name="nimhocd"&gt;National Institute of Mental Health. (2011). Obsessive-compulsive disorder, ocd. Retrieved from http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The obsessions include recurrent unwanted thoughts that cause compulsions, including repetitive behaviors.&lt;ref name="Mayoocd"&gt;Mayo Clinic Staff. (2010). Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Retrieved from http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/DS00189&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals that suffer from OCD may realize that their obsessions are not normal and try to stop their actions, but this only increases the person's anxiety towards the situation, and has an adverse effect. OCD often revolves around themes in one's life; for example, fear of coming in contact with germs (obsession).&lt;ref name="nimhocd" /&gt; To deal with the fear of germs one may compulsively wash their hands until they are chapped. OCD is a constituent of many other disorders including [[autism]], [[Tourette's syndrome]], and frontal lobe lesions.&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Stein. "Obsessive-compulsive disorder". The Lancet (August 2002), 360 (9330), pg. 397-405&lt;/ref&gt;

A person that shows a constant need to complete a certain "ritual", or is constantly plagued with unwelcome thoughts, may suffer from OCD. Themes of obsessions include fear of germs or dirt, having things orderly and symmetrical, and sexual thoughts and images.
Signs of obsessions:&lt;ref name="Mayoocd" /&gt;
* fear of shaking hands with others, or touching items others have touched;
* skin conditions due to excessive washing of one's hands;
* stress when items are not orderly or neat;
* replaying pornographic images in one's head.

Compulsions follow the theme of the obsessions, and are repetitive behaviors that individuals suffering from OCD feel will diminish the effect of the obsession.&lt;ref name="Mayoocd" /&gt; Compulsions also follow the theme, including hand washing, cleaning, performing actions repeatedly, or extreme orderliness.

Signs of compulsions:&lt;ref name="Mayoocd" /&gt;
* washing hands until skin is damaged;
* arranging food items so that everything faces the same way;
* checking locks repeatedly to make sure everything is locked;

[[Behavior therapy]] has proven to be an effective method for treating OCD.&lt;ref name="eddy"&gt;Eddy, M, F., &amp; Walbroehl, G, S. (1998). Recognition and treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Retrieved from http://www.aafp.org/afp/980401ap/eddy.html&lt;/ref&gt; Patients are exposed to the theme that is typically avoided, while being restricted from performing their usual anxiety reducing rituals. Behavior therapy rarely eliminates OCD, but it helps to reduce the signs and symptoms. With medication, this reduction of the disorder is even more evident. Antidepressants are usually the first prescribed medication to a patient with OCD. Medications that treat OCD typically inhibit the reuptake of [[serotonin]].&lt;ref name="eddy" /&gt;

Obsessive-compulsive individuals have difficulty forgetting unwanted thoughts.&lt;ref name="wil"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilhelm | first1 = S. | last2 = McNally | first2 = R.J. | last3 = Baer | first3 = L. | last4 = Florin | first4 = I. | year = 1996 | title = Directed forgetting in obsessive-compulsive disorder | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 34 | issue = 8| pages = 633–641 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(96)00040-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they encode this information into memory they encode it as a neutral or positive thought. This is inconsistent with what a person without OCD would think about this thought, leading the individual with OCD to continue displaying their specific "ritual" to help deal with their anxiety. When asked to forget information they have encoded, OCD patients have difficulty forgetting what they are told to forget only when the subject is negative.&lt;ref name="wil" /&gt; Individuals not affected by OCD do not show this tendency. Researchers have proposed a general deficit hypothesis for memory related problems in OCD.&lt;ref name="amir"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tolin | first1 = D. F. | last2 = Abramowitz | first2 = J. S. | last3 = Brigidi | first3 = B. D. | last4 = Amir | first4 = N. | last5 = Street | first5 = G. P. | year = 2001 | title = Memory and memory confidence in obsessive–compulsive disorder | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 39 | issue = 8| pages = 913–927 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7967(00)00064-4| pmid = 11480832 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are limited studies investigating this hypothesis. These studies propose that memory is enhanced for menacing events that have occurred during the individuals life. For example, a study demonstrated that individuals with OCD exhibit exceptional recall for previously encountered events, but only when the event promoted anxiety in the individual.

{{Paleontology}}
A '''fossil''' (from Classical [[Latin]] ''fossilis''; literally, "obtained by digging")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oed.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is any preserved remains, impression, or trace of any once-living thing from a past [[geological age]]. Examples include bones, shells, [[exoskeletons]], stone imprints of animals or [[microbes]], objects preserved in amber, hair, [[petrified wood]], oil, coal, and [[DNA]] remnants. The totality of fossils is known as the ''fossil record''.

[[Paleontology]] is the study of fossils: their age, method of formation, and [[evolution]]ary significance. Specimens are usually considered to be fossils if they are over 10,000&amp;nbsp;years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdnhm.org/science/paleontology/resources/frequent/ |title=theNAT :: San Diego Natural History Museum :: Your Nature Connection in Balboa Park :: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Sdnhm.org |date= |accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest fossils are from around 3.48&amp;nbsp;[[1000000000 (number)|billion]]&amp;nbsp;years old&lt;ref name="AP-20131113"&gt;{{cite news |last=Borenstein |first=Seth |title=Oldest fossil found: Meet your microbial mom |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20131113/DAA1VSC01.html |date=13 November 2013 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=15 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AST-20131108"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Noffke |first1=Nora |last2=Christian |first2=Christian |last3=Wacey |first3=David |last4=Hazen |first4=Robert M. |title=Microbially Induced Sedimentary Structures Recording an Ancient Ecosystem in the ca. 3.48 Billion-Year-Old Dresser Formation, Pilbara, Western Australia |date=8 November 2013 |journal=[[Astrobiology (journal)|Astrobiology]] |doi=10.1089/ast.2013.1030 |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=1103–24 |bibcode=2013AsBio..13.1103N |pmid=24205812 |pmc=3870916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Brian Vastag | title = Oldest 'microfossils' raise hopes for life on Mars | date = 21 August 2011 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oldest-microfossils-hail-from-34-billion-years-ago-raise-hopes-for-life-on-mars/2011/08/19/gIQAHK8UUJ_story.html?hpid=z3 | work = The Washington Post |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news | first = Nicholas | last = Wade | title = Geological Team Lays Claim to Oldest Known Fossils | date = 21 August 2011 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/science/earth/22fossil.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;src=ig | work = The New York Times |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 4.1 billion years old.&lt;ref name="AP-20151019"&gt;{{cite news |last=Borenstein |first=Seth |title=Hints of life on what was thought to be desolate early Earth |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20151019/us-sci--earliest_life-a400435d0d.html |date=19 October 2015 |work=[[Excite]] |location=Yonkers, NY |publisher=[[Mindspark Interactive Network]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS-20151014-pdf"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Elizabeth A. |last2=Boehnike |first2=Patrick |last3=Harrison |first3=T.

The development of [[radiometric dating]] techniques in the early 20th century allowed scientists to quantitatively measure the [[absolute ages]] of rocks and the fossils they host.

There are many processes that lead to fossilization, including [[permineralization]], casts and molds, authigenic mineralization, replacement and recrystallization, adpression, [[carbonization]], and bioimmuration.

A fossil normally preserves only a portion of the deceased organism, usually that portion that was partially [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralized]] during life, such as the [[bone]]s and teeth of [[vertebrate]]s, or the [[chitin]]ous or [[calcareous]] [[exoskeleton]]s of [[invertebrate]]s. Fossils may also consist of the marks left behind by the organism while it was alive, such as [[animal tracks]] or [[feces]] ([[coprolite]]s). These types of fossil are called [[trace fossil]]s or ''ichnofossils'', as opposed to ''body fossils''. Some fossils are [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and are called ''chemofossils'' or [[biosignature]]s.

==Fossilization processes==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}

The process of fossilization varies according to tissue type and external conditions.

===Permineralization===
[[File:Permian Silicified Sclerobionts.JPG|thumb|Silicified (replaced with silica) fossils from the Road Canyon Formation (Middle Permian of Texas)]]
[[Permineralization]] is a process of fossilization that occurs when an organism is buried. The empty spaces within an organism (spaces filled with liquid or gas during life) become filled with mineral-rich [[groundwater]]. Minerals precipitate from the groundwater, occupying the empty spaces. This process can occur in very small spaces, such as within the [[cell wall]] of a [[plant cell]]. Small scale permineralization can produce very detailed fossils. For permineralization to occur, the organism must become covered by sediment soon after death or soon after the initial decay process. The degree to which the remains are decayed when covered determines the later details of the fossil. Some fossils consist only of skeletal remains or teeth; other fossils contain traces of [[skin]], [[feather]]s or even soft tissues. This is a form of [[diagenesis]].

===Casts and molds===
{{anchor|Cast}} &lt;!--[[Cast (geology)]] and [[Casting (geology)]] redirect here--&gt;
[[File:Aviculopecten subcardiformis01.JPG|thumb|External mold of a [[Bivalvia|bivalve]] from the [[Logan Formation]], Lower [[Carboniferous]], Ohio]]
In some cases the original remains of the organism completely dissolve or are otherwise destroyed. The remaining organism-shaped hole in the rock is called an ''external mold''. If this hole is later filled with other minerals, it is a ''cast''. An [[endocast]] or ''internal mold'' is formed when sediments or minerals fill the internal cavity of an organism, such as the inside of a [[bivalve]] or [[snail]] or the hollow of a [[skull]].

===Authigenic mineralization===
This is a special form of cast and mold formation. If the chemistry is right, the organism (or fragment of organism) can act as a nucleus for the precipitation of minerals such as siderite, resulting in a nodule forming around it. If this happens rapidly before significant decay to the organic tissue, very fine three-dimensional morphological detail can be preserved. Nodules from the Carboniferous [[Mazon Creek fossil beds]] of Illinois, USA, are among the best documented examples of such mineralization.

===Replacement and recrystallization===
[[File:MatmorScleractinian.JPG|thumb|Recrystallized [[scleractinia]]n coral (aragonite to calcite) from the [[Jurassic]] of southern Israel]]
Replacement occurs when the shell, bone or other tissue is replaced with another mineral. In some cases mineral replacement of the original shell occurs so gradually and at such fine scales that microstructural features are preserved despite the total loss of original material. A shell is said to be ''recrystallized'' when the original skeletal compounds are still present but in a different crystal form, as from [[aragonite]] to [[calcite]].

===Adpression (compression-impression)===
[[Compression fossil]]s, such as those of fossil ferns, are the result of chemical reduction of the complex organic molecules composing the organism's tissues. In this case the fossil consists of original material, albeit in a geochemically altered state. This chemical change is an expression of [[diagenesis]]. Often what remains is a [[carbonaceous film]] known as a phytoleim, in which case the fossil is known as a compression. Often, however, the phytoleim is lost and all that remains is an impression of the organism in the rock—an impression fossil. In many cases, however, compressions and impressions occur together. For instance, when the rock is broken open, the phytoleim will often be attached to one part (compression), whereas the counterpart will just be an impression. For this reason, one term covers the two modes of preservation: ''adpression''.&lt;ref name="ShuteCleal 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shute |first1=C. H. |last2=Cleal |first2=C. J. |year=1986 |journal=Geological Curator |volume=4 |title=Palaeobotany in museums |pages=553–559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soft tissue, cell and molecular preservation====
Because of their antiquity, an unexpected exception to the alteration of an organism's tissues by chemical reduction of the complex organic molecules during fossilization has been the discovery of soft tissue in dinosaur fossils, including blood vessels, and the isolation of proteins and evidence for DNA fragments.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dinosaur-shocker-115306469/?no-ist |author=Fields H |title=Dinosaur Shocker - Probing a 68-million-year-old T. rex, Mary Schweitzer stumbled upon astonishing signs of life that may radically change our view of the ancient beasts |journal=Smithsonian Magazine |date= May 2006 |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6VelTG3Bd?url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dinosaur-shocker-115306469/?no-ist |archivedate= 2015-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MHS1&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/307/5717/1952.long |author=Schweitzer M H, Wittmeyer JL, Horner JR, Toporski JK |title= Soft-tissue vessels and cellular preservation in Tyrannosaurus rex |journal= Science |volume=307 |issue=5717 |pages=1952–5 |date= 2005-03-25 |pmid=15790853 |doi= 10.1126/science.1108397 |last2=Wittmeyer |last3=Horner |last4=Toporski |bibcode=2005Sci...307.1952S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MHS2&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schweitzer M H, Zheng W, Cleland T P, Bern M |title=Molecular analyses of dinosaur osteocytes support the presence of endogenous molecules |journal=Bone |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=414–23 |date=January 2013 |pmid=23085295 |doi= 10.1016/j.bone.2012.10.010|last2=Zheng |last3=Cleland |last4=Bern }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Emb&gt;{{cite journal | url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10586201 |author=Embery G, Milner A C, Waddington R J, Hall R C, Langley M L, Milan A M |title=Identification of Proteinaceous Material in the Bone of the Dinosaur Iguanodon |journal=Connective Tissue Research |volume=44(S1) |pages=41–6 |date=2003 |pmid=12952172 | doi= 10.1080/03008200390152070 |issue=1|last2=Milner |last3=Waddington |last4=Hall |last5=Langley |last6=Milan }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Mary Schweitzer]] and her colleagues reported the presence of iron particles ([[goethite]]-aFeO(OH)) associated with soft tissues recovered from dinosaur fossils. Based on various experiments that studied the interaction of iron in [[haemoglobin]] with blood vessel tissue they proposed that solution hypoxia coupled with iron [[chelation]] enhances the stability and preservation of soft tissue and provides the basis for an explanation for the unforeseen preservation of fossil soft tissues.&lt;ref name= SchweitzerOthers2014a&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1775/20132741.full-text.pdf |authors= Schweitzer, M.H., W.

===Carbonization===
[[Carbonaceous film]]s are thin coatings which consist predominantly of the chemical element [[carbon]]. The [[soft tissue]]s of organisms are made largely of [[organic carbon]] compounds and during diagenesis under reducing conditions only a thin film of carbon residue is left which forms a silhouette of the original organism.

===Bioimmuration===
[[File:Catellocaula.jpg|thumb|The star-shaped holes (''Catellocaula vallata'') in this Upper Ordovician bryozoan represent a soft-bodied organism preserved by bioimmuration in the bryozoan skeleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Palmer | first1 = T.

Bioimmuration occurs when a skeletal organism overgrows or otherwise subsumes another organism, preserving the latter, or an impression of it, within the skeleton.&lt;ref name="Taylor, PD. 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = P. D. | year = 1990 | title = Preservation of soft-bodied and other organisms by bioimmuration: A review | url = | journal = Palaeontology | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 1–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually it is a [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] skeletal organism, such as a [[bryozoan]] or an [[oyster]], which grows along a [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]], covering other sessile [[sclerobiont]]s. Sometimes the bioimmured organism is soft-bodied and is then preserved in negative relief as a kind of external mold. There are also cases where an organism settles on top of a living skeletal organism that grows upwards, preserving the settler in its skeleton. Bioimmuration is known in the fossil record from the [[Ordovician]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = MA | last2 = Palmer | first2 = T. J. | last3 = Taylor | first3 = P.

==Dating==

===Estimating dates===
{{Main article|Geochronology|Relative dating}}

Paleontology seeks to map out how life evolved across geologic time. A substantial hurdle is the difficulty of working out fossil ages. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for [[radiometric dating]]. This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50&amp;nbsp;million years old an absolute age, and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better.&lt;ref name="Martin2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | author1 = Martin, M.W. | author2 = Grazhdankin, D.V.; Bowring, S.A.; Evans, D.A.D.; Fedonkin, M.A.; Kirschvink, J.L. | date = 5 May 2000 | title = Age of Neoproterozoic Bilaterian Body and Trace Fossils, White Sea, Russia: Implications for Metazoan Evolution | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5467 | pages = 841–5 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5467.841 | pmid = 10797002 |bibcode = 2000Sci...288..841M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although radiometric dating requires careful laboratory work, its basic principle is simple: the rates at which various radioactive elements [[radioactive decay|decay]] are known, and so the ratio of the radioactive element to its decay products shows how long ago the radioactive element was incorporated into the rock. Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are volcanic ash layers, which may provide termini for the intervening sediments.&lt;ref name="Martin2000" /&gt;

====Stratigraphy====

Consequently, palaeontologists rely on [[stratigraphy]] to date fossils. Stratigraphy is the science of deciphering the "layer-cake" that is the [[sediment]]ary record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Pufahl, P.K. |author2=Grimm, K.A. |author3=Abed, A.M. |author4=Sadaqah, R.M.Y. |last-author-amp=yes | title=Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) phosphorites in Jordan: implications for the formation of a south Tethyan phosphorite giant | journal=[[Sedimentary Geology (journal)|Sedimentary Geology]] | volume=161 |date=October 2003 | pages=175–205 | doi=10.1016/S0037-0738(03)00070-8 | issue=3–4 | bibcode=2003SedG..161..175P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocks normally form relatively horizontal layers, with each layer younger than the one underneath it. If a fossil is found between two layers whose ages are known, the fossil's age is claimed to lie between the two known ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/radiometric.html | accessdate=20 September 2008
| title=Geologic Time: Radiometric Time Scale | publisher=U.S. Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because rock sequences are not continuous, but may be broken up by [[Fault (geology)|faults]] or periods of [[erosion]], it is very difficult to match up rock beds that are not directly adjacent. However, fossils of species that survived for a relatively short time can be used to match isolated rocks: this technique is called ''biostratigraphy''. For instance, the conodont ''Eoplacognathus pseudoplanus'' has a short range in the Middle Ordovician period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Löfgren, A. | year = 2004 | title = The conodont fauna in the Middle Ordovician ''Eoplacognathus pseudoplanus'' Zone of Baltoscandia | journal = Geological Magazine | volume = 141 | issue = 4 | pages = 505–524

| bibcode = 2004GeoM..141..505L }}&lt;/ref&gt; If rocks of unknown age have traces of ''E. pseudoplanus'', they have a mid-Ordovician age. Such [[index fossil]]s must be distinctive, be globally distributed and occupy a short time range to be useful. Misleading results are produced if the index fossils are incorrectly dated.&lt;ref name=Gehling2001&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gehling | first = James | last2 = Jensen | first2 = Sören | last3 = Droser | first3 = Mary | last4 = Myrow | first4 = Paul | last5 = Narbonne | first5 = Guy | title = Burrowing below the basal Cambrian GSSP, Fortune Head, Newfoundland | journal = Geological Magazine | volume = 138 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–218 |date=March 2001 | accessdate = 17 November 2008 | url = http://www.journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=74669 | doi = 10.1017/S001675680100509X| bibcode = 2001GeoM..138..213G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stratigraphy and biostratigraphy can in general provide only relative dating (''A'' was before ''B''), which is often sufficient for studying evolution. However, this is difficult for some time periods, because of the problems involved in matching rocks of the same age across [[continent]]s.&lt;ref name="Gehling2001"/&gt; Family-tree relationships also help to narrow down the date when lineages first appeared. For instance, if fossils of B or C date to X&amp;nbsp;million years ago and the calculated "family tree" says A was an ancestor of B and C, then A must have evolved earlier.

It is also possible to estimate how long ago two living clades diverged, in other words approximately how long ago their last common ancestor must have lived, by assuming that DNA [[mutation]]s accumulate at a constant rate. These "[[molecular clock]]s", however, are fallible, and provide only approximate timing: for example, they are not sufficiently precise and reliable for estimating when the groups that feature in the [[Cambrian explosion]] first evolved,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Hug, L.A. |author2=Roger, A.J. | title=The Impact of Fossils and Taxon Sampling on Ancient Molecular Dating Analyses | journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution | year=2007 | volume=24 | issue=8 | pages=889–1897 | doi=10.1093/molbev/msm115 | pmid=17556757}}&lt;/ref&gt; and estimates produced by different techniques may vary by a factor of two.&lt;ref name="PetersonEtAl2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0503660102 | pmid = 15983372 |author1=Peterson, Kevin J. |author2=Butterfield, N.J. | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 102 | issue = 27 | pages = 9547–52 | year = 2005

[[File:Fossil record gaps 20131028.pdf|thumb|right|Some of the most remarkable gaps in the fossil record (as of October 2013) show slanting toward organisms with hard parts.]]
Organisms are only rarely preserved as fossils in the best of circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. This is illustrated by the fact that the number of species known through the fossil record is less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.&lt;ref name=Prothero2007pp5053&gt;{{harvnb|Prothero|2007|pp=50–53}}{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the specialized and rare circumstances required for a biological structure to fossilize, only a small percentage of life-forms can be expected to be represented in discoveries, and each discovery represents only a snapshot of the process of evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which will never demonstrate an exact half-way point.&lt;ref name = "CC200"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC200.html|title = Claim CC200: There are no transitional fossils.|accessdate =30 April 2009 |date = 2006-11-05|publisher = [[TalkOrigins Archive]]|last = Isaak|first = M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sites==

===Lagerstätten===
{{Main article|Lagerstätte}}
{{Further|List of fossil sites}}

Fossil sites with exceptional preservation—sometimes including preserved soft tissues—are known as [[Lagerstätte]]n - German for "storage places". These formations may have resulted from carcass burial in an [[hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] environment with minimal bacteria, thus slowing decomposition. Lagerstätten span [[geology|geological]] time from the [[Cambrian]] period to the [[Holocene|present]]. Worldwide, some of the best examples of near-perfect fossilization are the [[Cambrian]] [[Maotianshan shales]] and [[Burgess Shale]], the [[Devonian]] [[Hunsrück Slates]], the [[Jurassic]] [[Solnhofen limestone]], and the [[Carboniferous]] [[Mazon Creek]] localities.

===Stromatolites===
{{Main article|Stromatolites}}
[[File:Stromatolites Cochabamba.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9| Lower Proterozoic [[stromatolite]]s from [[Bolivia]], South America]]

Stromatolites are layered [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]]ary [[structure]]s formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding and cementation of sedimentary grains by [[biofilm]]s of [[microorganism]]s, especially [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Riding | year = 2007 | first = R. | title = The term stromatolite: towards an essential definition | journal = Lethaia | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 321–330 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119935443/abstract | format = | accessdate = | doi = 10.1111/j.1502-3931.1999.tb00550.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stromatolites provide some of the most ancient fossil records of life on Earth, dating back more than 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fossilmuseum.net/Tree_of_Life/Stromatolites.htm| title=Stromatolites, the Oldest Fossils| accessdate=4 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stromatolites were much more abundant in Precambrian times. While older, [[Archean]] fossil remains are presumed to be [[colony (biology)|colonies]] of [[cyanobacteria]], younger (that is, [[Proterozoic]]) fossils may be [[prehistoric|primordial]] forms of the [[Eukaryota|eukaryote]] [[Chlorophyta|chlorophytes]] (that is, [[green algae]]). One [[genus]] of stromatolite very common in the [[geologic time scale|geologic record]] is ''[[Collenia]]''.

The connection between grazer and stromatolite abundance is well documented in the younger [[Ordovician]] [[evolutionary radiation]]; stromatolite abundance also increased after the [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction events|end-Ordovician]] and [[Permian extinction|end-Permian]] extinctions decimated marine animals, falling back to earlier levels as marine animals recovered.&lt;ref name="SheehanHarris2004ResurgenceAfterOrdovicianExtinction"&gt;{{cite journal

While [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cyanobacteria themselves reproduce asexually through cell division, they were instrumental in priming the environment for the [[timeline of evolution|evolutionary development]] of more complex [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms. Cyanobacteria (as well as [[extremophile]] [[Gammaproteobacteria]]) are thought to be largely responsible for increasing the amount of [[oxygen]] in the primeval earth's [[atmosphere]] through their continuing [[photosynthesis]]. Cyanobacteria use [[water]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[sunlight]] to create their food. A layer of [[mucus]] often forms over mats of cyanobacterial cells. In modern microbial mats, debris from the surrounding habitat can become trapped within the mucus, which can be cemented by the calcium carbonate to grow thin laminations of [[limestone]]. These laminations can accrete over time, resulting in the banded pattern common to stromatolites. The domal morphology of biological stromatolites is the result of the vertical growth necessary for the continued infiltration of sunlight to the organisms for photosynthesis. Layered spherical growth structures termed [[oncolite]]s are similar to stromatolites and are also known from the [[fossil record]]. [[Thrombolite]]s are poorly laminated or non-laminated clotted structures formed by cyanobacteria common in the fossil record and in modern sediments.&lt;ref name=Lepot2008/&gt;

The Zebra River Canyon area of the Kubis platform in the deeply dissected Zaris Mountains of southwestern [[Namibia]] provides an extremely well exposed example of the thrombolite-stromatolite-metazoan reefs that developed during the Proterozoic period, the stromatolites here being better developed in updip locations under conditions of higher current velocities and greater sediment influx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Adams, E.

==Types==

===Index===
{{Main article|Index fossil}}
[[File:Index fossils.gif|right|thumb|Examples of index fossils]]

Index fossils (also known as guide fossils, indicator fossils or zone fossils) are fossils used to define and identify [[geologic column|geologic period]]s (or faunal stages). They work on the premise that, although different [[sediment]]s may look different depending on the conditions under which they were deposited, they may include the remains of the same [[species]] of fossil. The shorter the species' time range, the more precisely different sediments can be correlated, and so rapidly evolving species' fossils are particularly valuable. The best index fossils are common, easy to identify at species level and have a broad distribution—otherwise the likelihood of finding and recognizing one in the two sediments is poor.

===Trace===
{{Main article|Trace fossil}}
[[File:CambrianRusophycus.jpg|thumb|[[Cambrian]] [[trace fossil]]s including ''[[Rusophycus]]'', made by a [[trilobite]]]]
[[File:Coprolite.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A coprolite of a carnivorous dinosaur found in southwestern [[Saskatchewan]]]]

Trace fossils consist mainly of tracks and burrows, but also include [[coprolite]]s (fossil [[feces]]) and marks left by feeding.&lt;ref name="UCMPWhatIsPaleo"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FedonkinGehlingEtAl2007RiseOfAnimals" /&gt; Trace fossils are particularly significant because they represent a data source that is not limited to animals with easily fossilized hard parts, and they reflect animal behaviours. Many traces date from significantly earlier than the body fossils of animals that are thought to have been capable of making them.&lt;ref name="Seilacher1994"&gt;e.g. {{Cite journal

Coprolites are classified as [[trace fossil]]s as opposed to body fossils, as they give evidence for the animal's behaviour (in this case, diet) rather than morphology. They were first described by [[William Buckland]] in 1829. Prior to this they were known as "fossil [[conifer cone#Pinaceae cones|fir cone]]s" and "[[bezoar]] stones." They serve a valuable purpose in paleontology because they provide direct evidence of the predation and diet of extinct organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=coprolites|title=coprolites - Definitions from Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coprolites may range in size from a few millimetres to over 60 centimetres.

===Transitional===
{{Main article|Transitional fossil}}
{{Further|List of transitional fossils}}

A ''transitional fossil'' is any fossilized remains of a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herron|first=Scott Freeman, Jon C.|title=Evolutionary analysis|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=gnZIngEACAAJ|page=816}}|year=2004|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-13-101859-4|page=816|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. These fossils serve as a reminder that taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation.

===Microfossils===
[[File:Microfossils.JPG|thumb|left|Microfossils about 1&amp;nbsp;mm]]
{{Main article|Micropaleontology}}

Microfossil is a descriptive term applied to fossilized plants and animals whose size is just at or below the level at which the fossil can be analyzed by the naked eye. A commonly applied cutoff point between "micro" and [[macrofossil|"macro" fossils]] is 1&amp;nbsp;mm. Microfossils may either be complete (or near-complete) organisms in themselves (such as the marine plankters [[foraminifera]] and [[coccolithophore]]s) or component parts (such as small teeth or [[palynology|spores]]) of larger animals or plants. Microfossils are of critical importance as a reservoir of [[Paleoclimatology|paleoclimate]] information, and are also commonly used by [[biostratigraphy|biostratigraphers]] to assist in the correlation of rock units.

===Resin===

{{Main article|Amber}}

[[File:Leptofoenus pittfieldae (male) rotated.JPG|thumb|''[[Leptofoenus pittfieldae]]'' trapped in [[Dominican amber]], from 20 to 16&amp;nbsp;million years ago]]

Fossil resin (colloquially called [[amber]]) is a natural [[polymer]] found in many types of strata throughout the world, even the [[Arctic]]. The oldest fossil resin dates to the [[Triassic]], though most dates to the [[Cenozoic]]. The excretion of the resin by certain plants is thought to be an evolutionary [[adaptation]] for protection from insects and to seal wounds. Fossil resin often contains other fossils called inclusions that were captured by the sticky resin. These include bacteria, fungi, other plants, and animals. Animal inclusions are usually small [[invertebrates]], predominantly [[arthropod]]s such as insects and spiders, and only extremely rarely a [[vertebrate]] such as a small lizard. Preservation of inclusions can be exquisite, including small fragments of [[DNA]].

===Derived===

[[File:CentrumSideView.jpg|thumb|Eroded [[Jurassic]] [[plesiosaur]] vertebral centrum found in the Lower [[Cretaceous]] Faringdon Sponge Gravels in Faringdon, England. An example of a ''remanié'' fossil.]]

A ''derived'', ''reworked'' or ''remanié fossil'' is a fossil found in rock that accumulated significantly later than when the fossilized animal or plant died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Neuendorf |first1=Klaus K. E. |last2=Institute |first2=American Geological |title=Glossary of Geology |date=2005 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9780922152766 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=yD79FqfECCYC&amp;pg=PA551&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reworked fossils are created by erosion exhuming (freeing) fossils from the rock formation in which they were originally deposited and their redeposition in an younger sedimentary deposit.

===Wood===
{{Main article|Fossil wood}}
[[File:Petrified forest log 2 md.jpg|thumb|right|[[Petrified wood]]. The internal structure of the tree and bark are maintained in the [[#Permineralization|permineralization]] process.]]
[[File:Petrified wood close 052615.jpg|thumb|Polished section of petrified wood showing annual rings]]
Fossil wood is wood that is preserved in the fossil record. Wood is usually the part of a plant that is best preserved (and most easily found). Fossil wood may or may not be [[petrified wood|petrified]]. The fossil wood may be the only part of the plant that has been preserved:&lt;ref name="strauss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edstrauss.com/pwoodfx.html |title=Petrified Wood from Western Washington |author=Ed Strauss |year=2001 |accessdate=8 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211224655/http://www.edstrauss.com/pwoodfx.html |archivedate=11 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore such wood may get a special kind of [[botanical name]]. This will usually include "xylon" and a term indicating its presumed affinity, such as ''[[Araucarioxylon arizonicum|Araucarioxylon]]'' (wood of ''[[Araucaria]]'' or some related genus), ''[[Palmoxylon]]'' (wood of an indeterminate [[Arecaceae|palm]]), or ''Castanoxylon'' (wood of an indeterminate [[Castanopsis|chinkapin]]).&lt;ref name="stewart"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subfossil===
{{Main article|Subfossil}}
[[File:Dodo-Skeleton Natural History Museum London England.jpg|thumb|A subfossil [[dodo]] skeleton]]
The term subfossil can be used to refer to remains, such as bones, nests, or defecations, whose [[fossilization]] process is not complete, either because the length of time since the animal involved was living is too short (less than 10,000 years) or because the conditions in which the remains were buried were not optimal for fossilization. Subfossils are often found in caves or other shelters where they can be preserved for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate=2011-06-17 |accessdate=23 January 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main importance of subfossil vs. fossil remains is that the former contain organic material, which can be used for [[radiocarbon dating]] or extraction and sequencing of [[DNA sequencing|DNA]], [[protein sequencing|protein]], or other biomolecules. Additionally, [[isotope]] ratios can provide much information about the ecological conditions under which extinct animals lived. Subfossils are useful for studying the evolutionary history of an environment and can be important to studies in [[paleoclimatology]].

Subfossils are often found in depositionary environments, such as lake sediments, oceanic sediments, and soils. Once deposited, physical and chemical [[weathering]] can alter the state of preservation.

===Chemical fossils===
{{See also|Biosignature}}
Chemical fossils, or chemofossils, are chemicals found in rocks and fossil fuels (petroleum, coal, and natural gas) that provide an organic signature for ancient life. Molecular fossils and isotope ratios represent two types of chemical fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petrifiedwoodmuseum.org/ChemicalMolecularFossils.htm|title=Chemical or Molecular Fossils|website=petrifiedwoodmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest traces of life on Earth are fossils of this type, including carbon isotope anomalies found in [[zircon]]s that imply the existence of life as early as 4.1 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="AP-20151019"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS-20151014-pdf"/&gt;&lt;!--if 4.1 is too much recentism, there's still 3.8 from zircons from the same area, see refs in lead.--&gt;

==Astrobiology==
It has been suggested that [[Biomineralization|biominerals]] could be important indicators of [[extraterrestrial life]] and thus could play an important role in the search for past or present life on the planet [[Mars]]. Furthermore, [[Organic compounds (minerals)|organic components]] ([[biosignature]]s) that are often associated with biominerals are believed to play crucial roles in both pre-biotic and [[Biotic material|biotic]] reactions.&lt;ref name=SSG &gt;{{Cite book |editor2-first=David |editor2-last= Beaty |chapter=Final report of the MEPAG Astrobiology Field Laboratory Science Steering Group (AFL-SSG)| title=The Astrobiology Field Laboratory |editor1-first=Andrew |editor1-last=Steele |publisher=[[Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group]] (MEPAG) - NASA |place=U.S.A. |pages=72 |date=26 September 2006 |id= |chapter-url=http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports/AFL_SSG_WHITE_PAPER_v3.doc |chapter-format=.doc |accessdate=2014-12-29|author=The MEPAG Astrobiology Field Laboratory Science Steering Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pseudofossils==

[[File:Dendrites01.jpg|thumb|An example of a pseudofossil: Manganese dendrites on a limestone bedding plane from [[Solnhofen]], Germany; scale in mm]]

{{Main article|Pseudofossils}}

''Pseudofossils'' are visual patterns in rocks that are produced by geologic processes rather than biologic processes. They can easily be mistaken for real fossils. Some pseudofossils, such as [[Dendrite (crystal)|dendrite]]s, are formed by naturally occurring fissures in the rock that get filled up by percolating minerals. Other types of pseudofossils are kidney ore (round shapes in iron ore) and [[moss agate]]s, which look like moss or plant leaves. [[Concretion]]s, spherical or ovoid-shaped nodules found in some sedimentary strata, were once thought to be [[dinosaur]] eggs, and are often mistaken for fossils as well.

==History of the study of fossils==

{{Main article|History of paleontology}}

{{See also|Timeline of paleontology}}

Gathering fossils dates at least to the beginning of recorded history. The fossils themselves are referred to as the fossil record. The fossil record was one of the early sources of data underlying the study of [[evolution]] and continues to be relevant to the [[Timeline of evolution|history of life on Earth]]. [[Paleontologist]]s examine the fossil record to understand the process of evolution and the way particular [[species]] have evolved.

===Before Darwin===

Many early explanations relied on folktales or mythologies. In China the fossil bones of ancient mammals including ''[[Homo erectus]]'' were often mistaken for "[[dragon]] bones" and used as medicine and [[aphrodisiac]]s. In addition, some of these fossil bones are collected as "art" by scholars and they left scripts on it, indicating the time they got the collection. One good example is the famous scholar [[Huang Tingjian]] of the [[South Song Dynasty]] during the 11th century, who kept one seashell fossil with his poem engraved on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://culture.people.com.cn/BIG5/n/2013/0517/c22219-21521301.html |title=4億年前"書法化石"展出 黃庭堅曾刻下四行詩[圖] |trans-title=400 millions year fossil appeared in exhibition with poem by Huang Tingjian |date=2013-05-17 |access-date=2018-06-07 |publisher=[[People's Daily|People's Daily Net]] |language=zh-hant }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the West fossilized sea creatures on mountainsides were seen as proof of the [[Noah's Ark|biblical deluge]].

In 1027, the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Avicenna]] explained fossils' stoniness in ''[[The Book of Healing]]'':

{{quote|If what is said concerning the petrifaction of animals and plants is true, the cause of this (phenomenon) is a powerful mineralizing and petrifying virtue which arises in certain stony spots, or emanates suddenly from the earth during earthquake and subsidences, and petrifies whatever comes into contact with it. As a matter of fact, the petrifaction of the bodies of plants and animals is not more extraordinary than the transformation of waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science, optics, and music in medieval and early modern thought|author=Alistair Cameron Crombie|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1990|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=zWrH7h9jNgUC|page=108}}|isbn=978-0-907628-79-8|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] scholar [[Aristotle]] realized that fossil seashells from rocks were similar to those found on the beach, indicating the fossils were once living animals. [[Aristotle]] previously explained it in terms of [[vapor]]ous [[exhalation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Meteorology'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.3.iii.html III.6]&lt;/ref&gt; which Avicenna modified into the theory of [[Petrifaction|petrifying]] [[fluid]]s (''succus lapidificatus''), later elaborated by [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]] in the 14th century and accepted in some form by most [[naturalist]]s by the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Meaning of Fossils: Episodes in the History of Palaeontology|first=M.

More scientific views of fossils emerged during the [[Renaissance]]. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] concurred with Aristotle's view that fossils were the remains of ancient life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmnh.com/wmas0002.htmCorrelating Earth's History]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Paul R. Janke&lt;/ref&gt; For example, da Vinci noticed discrepancies with the biblical flood narrative as an explanation for fossil origins:

{{quote|If the Deluge had carried the shells for distances of three and four hundred miles from the sea it would have carried them mixed with various other natural objects all heaped up together; but even at such distances from the sea we see the oysters all together and also the shellfish and the cuttlefish and all the other shells which congregate together, found all together dead; and the solitary shells are found apart from one another as we see them every day on the sea-shores.}}

{{quote|And we find oysters together in very large families, among which some may be seen with their shells still joined together, indicating that they were left there by the sea and that they were still living when the strait of Gibraltar was cut through. In the mountains of Parma and Piacenza multitudes of shells and corals with holes may be seen still sticking to the rocks...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =da Vinci | first =Leonardo | authorlink =Leonardo da Vinci | title =The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci | publisher =Reynal &amp; Hitchcock | date = 1956 | origyear=1938 | location =London | page =335 | url ={{google books |plainurl=y |id=qMoQAAAAIAAJ|page335}}| isbn = 978-0973783735}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Robert Hooke]] (1635-1703) included [[micrograph]]s of fossils in his ''[[Micrographia]]'' and was among the first to observe fossil [[foram]]s. His observations on fossils, which he stated to be the petrified remains of creatures some of which no longer existed, were published posthumously in 1705.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/history-of-geology/july-2-1635-robert-hooke-the-last-virtuoso-of-silly-science/ |title=July 18, 1635: Robert Hooke - The Last Virtuoso of Silly Science |last=Bressan |first=David |work=Scientific American Blog Network |access-date=2018-02-11 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith (1769–1839)]], an English canal engineer, observed that rocks of different ages (based on the [[law of superposition]]) preserved different assemblages of fossils, and that these assemblages succeeded one another in a regular and determinable order. He observed that rocks from distant locations could be correlated based on the fossils they contained. He termed this the principle of ''faunal succession''. This principle became one of Darwin's chief pieces of evidence that biological evolution was real.

[[Georges Cuvier]] came to believe that most if not all the animal fossils he examined were remains of extinct species. This led Cuvier to become an active proponent of the geological school of thought called [[catastrophism]]. Near the end of his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants he said:

:''All of these facts, consistent among themselves, and not opposed by any report, seem to me to prove the existence of a world previous to ours, destroyed by some kind of catastrophe.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/History/cuvier.xhtml|title=Cuvier|website=palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in fossils, and geology more generally, expanded during the early nineteenth century.  In Britain, [[Mary Anning]]'s discoveries of fossils, including the first complete [[ichthyosaur]] and a complete [[plesiosaurus]] skeleton, sparked both public and scholarly interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mary Anning |url=http://www.lymeregismuseum.co.uk/collection/mary-anning/ |website=Lyme Regis Museum |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linnaeus and Darwin===

Early [[Natural science|naturalists]] well understood the similarities and differences of living species leading [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] to develop a hierarchical classification system still in use today. Darwin and his contemporaries first linked the hierarchical structure of the tree of life with the then very sparse fossil record. Darwin eloquently described a process of descent with modification, or evolution, whereby organisms either adapt to natural and changing environmental pressures, or they perish.

When Darwin wrote ''[[On the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life]]'', the oldest animal fossils were those from the [[Cambrian]] Period, now known to be about 540&amp;nbsp;million years old. He worried about the absence of older fossils because of the implications on the validity of his theories, but he expressed hope that such fossils would be found, noting that: "only a small portion of the world is known with accuracy." Darwin also pondered the sudden appearance of many groups (i.e. [[phylum|phyla]]) in the oldest known Cambrian fossiliferous strata.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C (1859) On the Origin of Species. Chapter 10: On the Imperfection of the Geological Record.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Darwin===

Since Darwin's time, the fossil record has been extended to between 2.3 and 3.5&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref&gt;Schopf JW (1999) Cradle of Life: The Discovery of the Earth's Earliest Fossils, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these Precambrian fossils are microscopic bacteria or [[Micropaleontology|microfossils]]. However, macroscopic fossils are now known from the late Proterozoic. The [[Ediacara biota]] (also called Vendian biota) dating from 575&amp;nbsp;million years ago collectively constitutes a richly diverse assembly of early multicellular [[eukaryote]]s.

The fossil record and faunal succession form the basis of the science of [[biostratigraphy]] or determining the age of rocks based on embedded fossils. For the first 150 years of [[geology]], biostratigraphy and superposition were the only means for determining the [[Relative dating|relative age]] of rocks. The [[geologic time scale]] was developed based on the relative ages of rock strata as determined by the early paleontologists and [[Stratigraphy|stratigrapher]]s.

Since the early years of the twentieth century, [[absolute dating]] methods, such as [[radiometric dating]] (including [[K–Ar dating|potassium/argon]], [[Argon–argon dating|argon/argon]], [[uranium-lead dating|uranium series]], and, for very recent fossils, [[radiocarbon dating]]) have been used to verify the relative ages obtained by fossils and to provide absolute ages for many fossils. Radiometric dating has shown that the earliest known stromatolites are over 3.4&amp;nbsp;billion years old.

===Modern era===

Paleontology has joined with [[evolutionary biology]] to share the interdisciplinary task of outlining the tree of life, which inevitably leads backwards in time to Precambrian microscopic life when cell structure and functions evolved. Earth's deep time in the Proterozoic and deeper still in the Archean is only "recounted by microscopic fossils and subtle chemical signals."&lt;ref&gt;Knoll, A, (2003) Life on a Young Planet. (Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ)&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular biologists, using [[phylogenetics]], can compare protein [[amino acid]] or [[nucleotide]] sequence homology (i.e., similarity) to evaluate taxonomy and evolutionary distances among organisms, with limited statistical confidence. The study of fossils, on the other hand, can more specifically pinpoint when and in what organism a mutation first appeared. Phylogenetics and paleontology work together in the clarification of science's still dim view of the appearance of life and its evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Paul CRC and Donovan SK, (1998) An overview of the completeness of the fossil record. in The Adequacy of the Fossil Record (Paul CRC and Donovan SK eds). 111–131 (John Wiley, New York).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eldredgeops-rana-crassituberculata.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Phacopid]] [[trilobite]] ''Eldredgeops rana crassituberculata''. The genus is named after [[Niles Eldredge]].]]

[[File:Isocrinus nicoleti Encrinite Mt Carmel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Crinoid]] columnals (''Isocrinus nicoleti'') from the Middle [[Jurassic]] [[Carmel Formation]] at Mount Carmel Junction, [[Utah]]]]

[[Niles Eldredge]]'s study of the ''[[Phacops]]'' [[trilobite]] [[genus]] supported the hypothesis that modifications to the arrangement of the trilobite's eye lenses proceeded by fits and starts over millions of years during the [[Devonian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Fortey, Richard]], ''Trilobite!: Eyewitness to Evolution''. Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Eldredge's interpretation of the ''Phacops'' fossil record was that the aftermaths of the lens changes, but not the rapidly occurring evolutionary process, were fossilized. This and other data led [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] to publish their seminal paper on [[punctuated equilibrium]] in 1971.

[[Synchrotron]] [[X-ray]] [[Tomography|tomographic]] analysis of early Cambrian bilaterian [[embryo]]nic microfossils yielded new insights of [[Animal|metazoan]] evolution at its earliest stages. The tomography technique provides previously unattainable three-dimensional resolution at the limits of fossilization. Fossils of two enigmatic bilaterians, the worm-like ''[[Markuelia]]'' and a putative, primitive [[protostome]], ''[[Pseudooides]]'', provide a peek at [[germ layer]] embryonic development. These 543-million-year-old embryos support the emergence of some aspects of [[arthropod]] development earlier than previously thought in the late Proterozoic. The preserved embryos from [[China]] and [[Siberia]] underwent rapid [[Diagenesis|diagenetic]] phosphatization resulting in exquisite preservation, including cell structures. This research is a notable example of how knowledge encoded by the fossil record continues to contribute otherwise unattainable information on the emergence and development of life on Earth. For example, the research suggests ''Markuelia'' has closest affinity to priapulid worms, and is adjacent to the evolutionary branching of [[Priapulida]], [[Nematode|Nematoda]] and [[Arthropod]]a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donoghue | first1 = PCJ | last2 = Bengtson | first2 = S | last3 = Dong | first3 = X | last4 = Gostling | first4 = NJ | last5 = Huldtgren | first5 = T | last6 = Cunningham | first6 = JA | last7 = Yin | first7 = C | last8 = Yue | first8 = Z | last9 = Peng | first9 = F ''et al.'' | year = 2006 | title = Synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy of fossil embryos | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 442 | issue = 7103| pages = 680–683 | doi=10.1038/nature04890| pmid = 16900198 | displayauthors = etal | bibcode = 2006Natur.442..680D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trading and collecting==

''Fossil collecting'' (sometimes, in a non-scientific sense, fossil hunting) is the collection of fossils for scientific study, hobby, or profit. Fossil collecting, as practiced by amateurs, is the predecessor of modern paleontology and many still collect fossils and study fossils as amateurs. Professionals and amateurs alike collect fossils for their scientific value.

'''Glenda Proby''' (born 1987/1988),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/profile/9945-meet-the-queer-female-mc-whos-writing-your-favorite-rappers-songs/|title=Meet Gizzle, the Queer Female MC Who’s Writing Your Favorite Rappers’ Songs|last=Aku|first=Timmhotep|date=September 6, 2016|website=Pitchfork|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; better known by her stage names '''Gizzle''' and '''Lady G''', is an American [[hip hop]] [[songwriter]] and [[rapper]]. Beginning her career as a [[ghostwriter]] for [[Lil' Fizz]] and [[Snoop Dogg]] in 2008, she has since collaborated with a number of prominent artists, particularly [[Puff Daddy]] and [[Ty Dolla Sign]]. She made her first appearance as a featured artist in 2015, on "You Can Be My Lover" from Puff Daddy's album ''[[MMM (Money Making Mitch)|MMM]]''[[MMM (Money Making Mitch)|,]] and released her debut [[mixtape]] ''7 Days in Atlanta'' in 2017.

== Early career ==
From [[South Los Angeles]], Proby showed a talent for writing from a young age, composing poetry and lengthy letters to her father when he was in jail.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kulturehub.com/gizzle-artist-feature/|title=Gizzle, the LA songwriter behind some of your favorite hits, is going solo|last=Easy|first=Claude J.|date=October 6, 2017|website=KultureHub|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started rapping as a teenager under the stage name ''Lady G Da Real Deal'', regularly attending [[freestyle rap]] events in Los Angeles and [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino county]]. She recorded a [[Demo (music)|demo]] with Rhythm D of [[Ruthless Records]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and was offered a [[recording contract]] at the age of 17. However, she was encouraged by her manager, Cudda Love, to pursue songwriting for others instead.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/south-la-rapper-gizzle-has-ghostwritten-for-all-the-dudes-now-shes-writing-for-herself-7901167|title=South L.A.

In 2007, she gained her first writing credit on the [[Lil' Fizz]] track "Beds". She was then invited by producer [[Teddy Riley]] to write for [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop Dogg's]] 2008 album [[Ego Trippin'|''Ego Trippin''&lt;nowiki/&gt;']].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She is credited on the tracks "Gangsta Like Me" and "Can't Say Goodbye",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ascap.com/repertory#ace/writer/426541370/PROBY%20GLENDA%20R|title=Proby Glenda R|last=|first=|date=|website=ACE Repertory|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which were regularly highlighted in positive reviews of the album.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Gavin|date=March 20, 2008|title=Snoop Dogg: Ego Trippin'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/19002772/review/19059601/ego_trippin|deadurl=yes|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=|volume=|pages=63–64|issn=0035-791X|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308152956/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/19002772/review/19059601/ego_trippin|archivedate=March 8, 2008|via=|magazine=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2008/03/07/ego-trippin/|title=Ego Trippin'|last=Watson|first=Margeaux|date=March 7, 2008|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=July 26, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11277-ego-trippin/|title=Snoop Dogg: Ego Trippin' Album Review|last=Breihan|first=Tom|date=March 14, 2008|website=Pitchfork|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/ego-trippin-mw0000751573|title=Ego Trippin' – Snoop Dogg|last=Jeffries|first=David|date=|website=AllMusic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/11/snoop-dogg-ego-trippin-review|title=Snoop Dogg – Ego Trippin' Review|last=|first=|authors=Spence D.|date=March 11, 2008|website=IGN|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ghostwriting ==
Since her early work with Riley and Snoop Dogg, Proby has become a prolific hip hop [[ghostwriter]], working with prominent artists including [[Kanye West]], [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Meek Mill]], [[Boosie Badazz]], [[Kevin Gates]], [[G-Eazy]], [[Iggy Azalea]], [[Trey Songz]], [[Travis Scott]] and [[T.I.]] Two of her most frequent collaborators are [[Ty Dolla Sign]], who she has worked with since 2008, and [[Puff Daddy]] (Sean Combs), whose albums ''[[MMM (album)|MMM]]'' and ''[[No Way Out 2]]'' she contributed to extensively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unusually for a female writer, Proby writes primarily for male rappers, but has been praised for successfully "getting inside the heads" of artists and working closely with them to compose songs that match their personal styles. She is also one of very few prominent [[queer]] women in the hip hop industry. Ty Dolla Sign has stated that this is an advantage in the often hypermasculine and hypersexualised world of hip hop, "you know she gets both sides ’cause Gizzle got bitches too!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Solo career ==
Proby began performing her own songs under the stage name Gizzle in 2011, posting several videos on her [[YouTube]] channel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2015, she was credited as a featured artist on "You Can Be My Lover" from Puff Daddy's album ''MMM.'' The following year, her appearance in the video for the track, as an unexpected "butch lesbian leading the song, rapping about hollering at women in the middle of a misogynistic smorgasbord,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themuse.jezebel.com/progress-gizzle-a-queer-mc-rapped-about-boning-women-1768290794|title=Progress: Gizzle, a Queer MC, Rapped About Boning Women In a Puffy Video &amp; No One Blinked An Eye|last=Coker|first=Hillary Crosley|date=March 31, 2016|work=The Muse|access-date=July 26, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a breakout performance for Gizzle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.colorlines.com/articles/after-writing-rap-hits-can-queer-female-mc-break-mainstream|title=After Writing Rap Hits, Can This Queer Female MC Break Into the Mainstream? {{!}} Colorlines|last=Rao|first=Sameer|date=September 7, 2016|work=Colorlines|access-date=July 26, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gizzle released her debut [[mixtape]], ''7 Days in Atlanta'', in January 2017.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The EP was produced in a single, week-long trip to [[Atlanta]], with one of seven songs being recorded each day. Gizzle plans to continue this concept with further ''7 Days'' mixtapes recorded in other cities, including Los Angeles, [[Philadelphia]] and [[Denver]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.undergroundhiphop.com/magazine/interview/gizzle-takes-on-the-rap-game/|title=Gizzle Steps Out Of The Ghostwriter Shadows To Take on the Rap Game|last=Orcutt|first=KC|date=|website=Underground Hip Hop|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Revolt'' described the EP as "a serious reminder of why [Gizzle] is one of the best in the business."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://revolt.tv/stories/2017/01/31/music-gizzle-7-days-atlanta-ep-070037b417|title=New Music: Gizzle, '7 Days in Atlanta' EP|last=Britt|first=Yazid|date=January 31, 2017|website=REVOLT TV|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Alexander Davidson''' (May 27, 1905 - August 23, 1973) was an American [[physician]], a psychiatric administrator, and a proponent of [[forensic psychiatry]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Biography==
Davidson was born on May 27, 1905 in [[Newark, New Jersey]], the son of a physician.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

He earned his undergraduate degree at the [[Columbia University]] in [[Manhattan, New York City]].  He attended the [[Jefferson Medical College]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and received his M.D. in 1928.  In 1931, he received an M.S. in [[neuropsychiatry]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  He interned at [[Newark Beth Israel Medical Center|Beth Israel Medical Center]] in Newark, New Jersey from 1928 to 1929, and was a resident at the [[Philadelphia Orthopedic Hospital and Infirmary for Nervous Diseases]] from 1931 to 1932.  He later became a diplomate in [[psychiatry]] given by the [[American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology]].

Davidson was in private practice in Newark for about ten years.  With the start of [[World War II]], he entered military service in 1941 and served in the South Pacific.  He left the military in 1947 with the rank of Major.  He entered the civil service at the [[Veterans Administration]] in Newark and worked at the central office in Washington, DC from 1950 to 1954.  He then became assistant superintendent of the [[Essex County Overbrook Hospital]], a large [[mental hospital]] in New Jersey.  He became the superintendent and stayed for twelve years.  When he left the hospital in 1969, he returned to his private practice, consulting, and lecturing.

Davidson lectured on medical legal matters at the Columbia University and the [[University of Virginia]].  He was a president of the [[New Jersey Psychiatric Association]], president of the [[New Jersey Academy of Medicine]], and president of the [[New Jersey Medico Legal Society]].  He served as parliamentarian of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) and wrote on parliamentary procedures.  He was editor of ''The Journal of the New Jersey Medical Society'' for 32 years, and was an editor of the ''American Journal of Psychiatry''.

He died ay his home, 276 Prospect Street in [[East Orange, New Jersey]] on August 23, 1973 of [[coronary thrombosis]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |title= Dr. Henry A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4476">The '''innovation butterfly''' is a [[metaphor]] that describes how seemingly minor perturbations (disturbances or changes) to project plans in a system connecting markets, demand, product features, and a firm's capabilities can steer the project, or an entire portfolio of projects, down an irreversible path in terms of technology and market evolution.

==Origins==
The metaphor was developed by researchers Anderson and Joglekar.&lt;ref name="SysThkr"&gt;Anderson, E.G. Jr. and Joglekar, N.R. (2007). "Chasing the Innovation Butterfly with 'Systems Thinking'", ''The Systems Thinker'', 18(9): 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt; It was conceived as a specific instance of the more general '[[butterfly effect]]' encountered in [[chaos theory]].

==How it works==
The innovation butterfly arises because many innovation systems are made up of a large number of elements that interact with each other via several non-linear [[feedback loop]]s containing embedded delays, thus constituting a [[complex system]].&lt;ref&gt;Sterman, J.D. (1994). "Learning in and about Complex Systems", ''System Dynamics Review'', 10(2-3): 291-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perturbations can come from decisions made within the firm or from those made by its competitors, or they can result from external forces such as government legislation or environmental regulations, or unexpected spikes in the [[Price of petroleum|price of oil]]. How the innovation system evolves as a result of the innovation butterfly can lead ultimately to an innovative firm's success or failure.

Complex systems, in domains such as [[physics]], [[biology]], or [[sociology]], are known to be prone to both [[path dependence]] and [[emergent behavior]]. What makes the behavior of the innovation butterfly different is market selection, along with biases in individual and group decision making within distributed innovation settings, may influence the emergent behavior. Furthermore, managers in most fields of business endeavor to reduce uncertainty in order to better manage risk. In innovation settings, however, because success is based upon [[creativity]], managers must actively embrace [[uncertainty]]. This leads to a management conundrum because innovation managers and management systems must encourage the potential for a butterfly effect but then must also learn how to cope with its aftermath.&lt;ref name="Joglekar 2007 pp. 7-9"&gt;Anderson and Joglekar (2007), pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Edward G and Nitin R. Joglekar. (2012). The Innovation Butterfly: Managing Emergent Opportunities and Risks During Distributed Innovation. Springer (Understanding Complex Systems Series)"&lt;/ref&gt;

How innovation butterflies are 'chased' is highly managerially relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Edward G. and Nitin Joglekar (2005).  A Hierarchical Modeling Framework for Product Development Planning.  ''Production and Operations Management'', 14 (3): 344-361.&lt;/ref&gt; Most butterflies end up 'merely' consuming a considerable amount of time and resources within a project, or for an innovation portfolio, within a firm. However, some butterflies can also unleash [[Regime change|regime-altering]] emergent outcomes within an entire industry segment.&lt;ref&gt;Garud, R. and Karnøe, P. 2001 ‘Path Creation as a Process of Mindful Deviation’. In Path Dependence and Creation, R. Garud and P. Karnøe (eds.) Lawrence Erlbaum Associates: 1-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, once these emergent outcomes begin to mature, and in some instances lead to [[disruptive innovation]]s, they become extremely difficult to manage,&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Clayton M. (1997). The Innovator's Dilemma : When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail. Harvard Business Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, shaping the innovation system before potential innovation butterfly's effects completely emerge is critical.&lt;ref name="Joglekar 2007 pp. 7-9"/&gt;

'''Intuitive grief''' and '''instrumental grief''' are two patterns of grieving styles identified by psychiatrists [[Terry Martin (psychiatrist)|Terry Martin]] and Kenneth Doka. Intuitive and instrumental grief describes two ends of a grieving scale. Individuals who exhibit more qualities of the intuitive grieving style are called intuitive grievers. Individuals who exhibit more qualities of the instrumental grieving style are called instrumental grievers. Common qualities of intuitive grieving are: an internal experience characterized by extreme sadness and pain as well as an outward experience characterized by emotional expression (ex: tears).&lt;ref name=pilot&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=T.L.|title=A Pilot Study of a Tool to Measure Instrumental and Intuitive Styles of Grieving|journal=Omega|date=2006|volume=53|issue=4|pages=263–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common qualities of instrumental grieving are: an internal experience characterized by mental separation from the loss as well as an outward experience characterized by lack of emotion. Identification of an individual’s particular style of grieving is important because an individual’s particular style of grieving helps in creating an adequate treatment plan to assist the individual in coping with his or her loss.&lt;ref name=pilot/&gt;

== Intuitive Grief ==
Individuals who experience more qualities related to the intuitive grieving style experience and express their grief primarily through affect.&lt;ref name=investigating&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doughty|first1=E.A.|title=Investigating Adaptive Grieving Styles: A Delphi Study|journal=Death Studies|date=2009|volume=33|issue=5|pages=462–480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitive grievers develop more extreme emotional symptoms and cope with their loss mainly by sharing their feelings with others. These individuals are more likely to seek and/or accept community support through events such as self-help groups or one-on-one grief therapy.&lt;ref name=pilot/&gt;

== Instrumental Grief ==
Individuals who experience more qualities related to the instrumental grieving style are less likely to express emotion and often desire to rather master their feelings developed from the loss as well as master their surrounding environment. These individuals are marked by a more cognitive, problem-solving approach and are more likely to direct their energy into activities.&lt;ref name=investigating/&gt; Though instrumental grievers perceive loss more as a challenge to overcome rather than a threat, anger is usually the most readily expressed feeling.&lt;ref name=pilot/&gt;

== Blended Grief ==
Intuitive and instrumental grieving are two extreme styles of grieving located on a continuum. Because of this, it is rare to find people who belong purely to one style of a grieving pattern.&lt;ref name=pilot/&gt; The middle area between extreme intuitive grieving and extreme instrumental grieving is called '''blended grieving'''. People who exhibit qualities of both the intuitive grieving style as well as the instrumental grieving style are identified as '''blended grievers'''. Through blended grieving, a person naturally expresses grief in both cognitive (instrumental) and affective (intuitive) ways, however one style of grief is usually more dominant than the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doka|first=K.J.|title=Grieving Styles:Gender and Grief|journal=Grief Matters:The Australian Journal of Grief and Bereavement|date=2011|volume=14|issue=2|pages=42–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender Bias==
Martin and Doka’s first work on intuitive and instrumental grieving in 1996 emphasized “masculine” and “feminine” grief.&lt;ref name=pilot/&gt; Many of Martin and Doka’s readers began confusing the masculine and feminine identification of grieving styles with male and female gender association. Intuitive and instrumental grieving patterns have been found to be gender related, however are not gender determined therefore “masculine” grieving was renamed to “instrumental” while “feminine” grieving was renamed to “intuitive”. The assumption that males are supposed to grieve through instrumental ways and that females are supposed to grieve through intuitive ways is related to male and female sex roles that are taught and reinforced within a person’s culture.&lt;ref name=attitudes&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDowell|first1=E.E.|title=The Attitudes of Men and Women Concerning Gender Differences in Grief|journal=Omega|date=2005|volume=50|issue=1|pages=53–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, men have been raised to be more decisive, strong, successful and inexpressive which tends to lead males to be more private, intellectual and introspective in their grief; certain qualities associated with the instrumental grieving style.&lt;ref name=attitudes/&gt; In addition, women have traditionally been raised to be more passive, dependent and emotionally expressive than males which tends to lead women to act as such in times of grief; aspects associated with the intuitive grieving style.&lt;ref name=attitudes/&gt; Though there is correlation between gender and style of grieving, no pairing of gender and styles of grieving is right or wrong just as no particular style of grieving in general is right or wrong for an individual.

'''Islero''' was a [[Miura bull]] famed for killing the celebrated [[Bullfighting|bullfighter]] [[Manolete]] on August 28, 1947. Bulls from the Miura ranch, located near [[Seville]], Spain, are known for being large and ferocious.

Islero had poor eyesight and tended to chop with his right horn.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080320224005/http://www.geocities.com/matador1920/manolete.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On the fateful day, he was the fifth bull of the afternoon, and the second for Manolete, at a bullfight in the town of [[Linares, Jaén|Linares]] in the province of [[Jaén (Spanish province)|Jaén]], [[Andalucía]], Spain. The bull's manager begged Manolete to finish him off quickly; as the ''matador'' reached over the bull's horns, thrusting his ''estoque''  (sword) deep up to its hilt, Islero thrust his right horn into Manolete's groin, severing his [[femoral artery]]. The bullfighter was rushed to hospital, but died on the operating table later that evening.

Italian automaker [[Lamborghini]] named one of its [[grand tourer]]s "[[Lamborghini Islero|Islero]]" as part of the company's tradition of naming its cars after Miura bulls and with other bullfighting-related terms.

The Spanish project to build nuclear weapons was named Proyecto Islero.

'''''It''''' is a 1986 [[horror fiction|horror novel]] by American author [[Stephen King]]. It was his 22nd book, and his 18th novel written under his own name. The story follows the experiences of seven children as they are terrorized by an [[It (character)|entity]] that exploits the fears and phobias of its victims to disguise itself while hunting its prey. "It" primarily appears in the form of 'Pennywise the Dancing Clown' to attract its preferred prey of young children.

The novel is told through [[Nonlinear narrative|narratives alternating]] between two periods, and is largely told in the [[Narrative mode#Third-person.2C omniscient|third-person omniscient mode]]. ''It'' deals with themes that eventually became King staples: the power of memory, childhood trauma and its recurrent echoes in adulthood, the ugliness lurking behind a façade of small-town quaintness, and overcoming evil through mutual trust and sacrifice.

King has stated that he first conceived the story in 1978, and began writing it in 1981. He also stated that he originally wanted the [[It (character)|title character]] to be a [[troll]] like the one in the children's story ''[[Three Billy Goats Gruff]]'', but who inhabited the local [[sewer system]] rather than just the area beneath one bridge. He also wanted the story to interweave the stories of children and the adults they later become.&lt;ref name=nqcqmp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stephenking.com/library/novel/it_inspiration.html|title=StephenKing.com – IT Inspiration|website=stephenking.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/04/chips-it-warner-bros-release-dates-2017-1201742518/|title=Warner Bros. Sets 'CHiPs', 'It' &amp; Untitled PG-13 Comedy For 2017|publisher=Deadline|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|date=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel won the [[British Fantasy Award]] in 1987, and received nominations for the [[Locus Award|Locus]] and [[World Fantasy Award]]s that same year.&lt;ref name="WWE-1987"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1987| title = 1987 Award Winners &amp; Nominees| work = Worlds Without End| accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' listed ''It'' as the best-selling book in the United States in 1986.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
It has been adapted into a [[It (miniseries)|1990 two-part miniseries]] directed by [[Tommy Lee Wallace]], and into a two-part film duology directed by [[Andy Muschietti]]; ''[[It (2017 film)|It: Chapter One]]'' was released in 2017 and ''[[It – Chapter Two|It: Chapter Two]]'' will be released in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liljas-library.com/showinterview.php?id=73|title=Lilja's Library – The World of Stephen King [1996 – 2017]|work=liljas-library.com|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/04/chips-it-warner-bros-release-dates-2017-1201742518/|title=Warner Bros.

==Plot==
''The novel alternates between two timelines, often mid-chapter. The plot is described here in a linear order.''

===1957–1958===
During a heavy rainstorm in [[Derry, Maine]], six-year-old George "Georgie" Denbrough is chasing a paper boat that was given to him by his older brother, Bill, down a gutter. The boat is washed down a storm drain and Georgie peers in, seeing a pair of glowing yellow eyes. Georgie is confronted by [[It (character)|a man]] dressed in a silver clown suit who introduces himself as "Mr. Bob Gray", a.k.a. "Pennywise the Dancing Clown". Pennywise offers Georgie a balloon which he cautiously refuses. The clown then entices Georgie to reach into the drain to retrieve his boat; he then severs Georgie's arm and leaves him to bleed to death.

The following June, Benjamin "Ben" Hanscom, an overweight eleven-year-old boy, is harassed by a gang of bullies led by the feared Henry Bowers. On the last day of school, Ben hides from his tormentors in [[Derry (Stephen King)#The Barrens|the Barrens]] after an altercation with the Bowers Gang. Ben befriends Edward "Eddie" Kaspbrak and William "Bill" Denbrough, Georgie's older brother. The three boys later befriend fellow misfits Richard "Richie" Tozier, Stanley "Stan" Uris, and Beverly "Bev" Marsh, forming the "Losers Club". In July of the same summer, the Losers are joined by Michael "Mike" Hanlon.

As the summer draws on, the Losers realize that they have each had an encounter with a seemingly [[Omniscience|omniscient]], prehistoric shape-shifting alien entity which takes the form of whatever they fear the most: Ben saw him as a [[Mummy (monster)|mummy]], Eddie as a [[leper]], Bill as Georgie's [[ghost]], Richie as a [[werewolf]], Stan as two drowned boys, Mike as a flesh-eating bird that vaguely resembles [[Rodan]], and Beverly as a fountain of blood spurting from her bathroom sink. Due to the unknown origin of the monster, the Losers refer to the creature as "It" and link It with a series of recent child murders, including that of Edward "Eddie" Corcoran, who is killed by the monster in the form of the [[Gill-man]].

The Losers begin to suspect that It has control over Derry due to the number of unsolved disappearances and violent tragedies which go unnoticed or seem to be forgotten by the adults in the town. They begin to investigate It's origins, discovering that It is immortal and arrived in Derry millions of years ago. The Losers also learned that It awakens every 27 years from a slumber in the town's sewers, usually after a terrible event or tragedy, and feeds for 12 to 16 months.

The Losers decide to put an end to It and Ben makes two silver slugs out of a silver dollar, believing that silver will harm It. The kids go to the house on Neibolt Street where Eddie, Bill, and Richie had previously encountered It. It attacks them in the form of a werewolf. However, Beverly shoots a slug from Bill's slingshot, injuring It, and causing It to flee back to the sewers. Two weeks later, Beverly returns home, where her abusive father attacks her and attempts to rape and kill her. Beverly manages to escape. Henry, accompanied by his two closest friends, Victor "Vic" Criss and Reginald "Belch" Huggins, chases the Losers into the sewers, with the intention of killing them.

The narrative changes and "It" informs the reader that it existed originally in a void between our universe and others, in a dimension known as the Macroverse. It boasts of its own superiority to anything on planet [[Earth]]. It also explains that it chooses to prey on children, because their fears are easier to interpret in a physical form. It expresses its own fear that It might not be the only eternal being in existence. It suspects there might be Another, and that the children could be the agents of this Other. This might explain their power and unprecedented ability to harm It.

Back in the sewers, It attacks the three bullies in the form of [[Frankenstein's monster]], ripping Vic's head off and mutilating Belch's face. Henry, driven insane from seeing his friends killed, chases after the Losers and gets lost. He eventually washes out of the sewers into a nearby river and is blamed for all of the child murders. Meanwhile, Bill discovers the "Ritual of Chüd", allowing him to enter the Macroverse to confront It and discover It's true form; a mass of destructive orange lights referred to as the "Deadlights". During the ritual, Bill also encounters "The Turtle", an ancient being, possibly more ancient than It, that created the universe while vomiting after a stomach-ache. The Turtle explains that It can only be defeated during a battle of wills. Through it Bill also learns of yet another being: the Final Other. This Other is a force beyond the universe, the creator of the Turtle, and maybe even It. With the help of The Turtle, Bill is able to defeat It and send it back to its slumber. After the battle, the Losers get lost in the sewers until Beverly has sex with all the boys to connect childhood and adulthood while bringing unity back to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jef|last=Reuner|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/top-5-sickest-stephen-king-sex-scenes-nsfw-6371394|title=Top 5 Sickest Stephen King Sex Scenes (NSFW)|work=[[Houston Press]]|publisher=[[Voice Media]]|location=Houston, Texas|date=September 18, 2012|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Losers swear a [[Blood brother|blood oath]] to return to Derry, should It return in the future.

===1984–1985===
In July 1984, at the annual Derry carnival, three youths brutally attack a [[gay]] man named Adrian Mellon and throw him off a bridge. The boys are arrested and charged with murder when Mellon's mutilated corpse is found. One of the boys claims that he saw a clown dressed in a silver suit kill Mellon underneath the bridge. Adrian's boyfriend, the other victim in the attack, had also noticed the clown but the prosecutors convince him not to mention it during the trial.

When a string of child murders occurs in Derry once again, an adult Mike Hanlon, now the town's librarian and the only one of the Losers to remain in Derry, calls up the six former members of the Losers Club, all now in their thirties, and reminds them of their childhood promise to return should the killings start again. Bill Denbrough is now a successful horror writer living in England with his actress wife, Audra. Beverly Marsh is a fashion designer in Chicago, and is married to an abusive man named Tom Rogan. Eddie Kaspbrak has moved to New York City, where he runs a limousine rental company and has married a hysterical, codependent woman similar to his controlling mother. Richie Tozier lives in Los Angeles and works as a disc jockey. Ben Hanscom is now thin and a successful architect, living in Nebraska. Stan Uris is a wealthy accountant residing in Atlanta, Georgia.

Prior to Mike's phone calls, the Losers had buried the horror of their encounters with It. However, all but Stan reluctantly agree to return to Derry. After Mike's phone call, Stan is so terrified of facing It again that he slits his wrists in the bathtub, writing "IT" on the wall in his own blood. Tom refuses to let Beverly go and tries to beat her, but she lashes out at him before fleeing, causing him serious injury. The five return to Derry with only the slightest awareness of why they are doing so, remembering only the absolute terror and their promise to return.

The Losers meet for lunch, where Mike reminds them that It awakens once roughly every 27 years for 12–16 months at a time, feeding on children before going into slumber again. The group decides to kill It once and for all. At Mike's suggestion, each person explores different parts of Derry to help restore their memories. While exploring, Eddie, Richie, Beverly, and Ben are faced with manifestations of It (Eddie as Belch Huggins in leper form, Richie as a [[Paul Bunyan]] statue, Beverly as the witch from [[Hansel &amp; Gretel]], and Ben in the form of [[Dracula]]). Bill finds his childhood [[Schwinn Bicycle Company|Schwinn]], "Silver", and brings it to Mike's.

Three other people are also converging on the town: Audra, who is worried about Bill; Tom, who plans to kill Beverly; and Henry Bowers, who has escaped from Juniper Hill Mental Asylum with help from It. Mike and Henry have a violent confrontation at the library. Mike is nearly killed but Henry escapes, severely injured. Henry is driven to the hotel where It instructs him to kill the rest of the Losers. Henry attacks Eddie, breaking his arm once again, but in the fight, Henry is killed.

It appears to Tom and orders him to capture Audra. Tom brings Audra to It's lair. Upon seeing It's true form, Audra becomes [[catatonic]] and Tom drops dead from shock. Bill, Ben, Beverly, Richie, and Eddie learn that Mike is near death and realize they are being forced into another confrontation with It. They descend into the sewers and use their strength as a group to "send energy" to a hospitalized Mike, who fights off a nurse that is under the control of It. They reach It's lair and find It has taken the form of a giant spider. Bill and Richie enter It's mind through the Ritual of Chüd. Bill is initially dismayed to learn that the Turtle is now dead and almost loses to despair. But with Richie's help, the two of them manage to injure It. Eddie helps successfully bring Bill and Richie back from the Ritual, but in the process It rips off Eddie's arm, killing him. It runs away to tend to its injuries, but Bill, Richie, and Ben chase after It and find that It has laid eggs. Ben stays behind to destroy the eggs, while Bill and Richie head toward their final confrontation with It. Bill fights his way inside its body, locates It's heart and destroys it. As It writhes in the clear throes of death, Bill hears the voice of the Other complimenting him on his victory. The group meets up to head out of its lair, and although they try to bring Audra and Eddie's bodies with them, they are forced to leave Eddie behind. They make it to the surface and realize that the scars on their hands from when they were children have disappeared, indicating that their ordeal is finally over.

During the Ritual, the worst storm in Maine's history sweeps through Derry, destroying most of the buildings as the downtown area collapses. Mike concludes that Derry is finally dying. Richie returns to LA, Ben and Beverly leave town together, and while Mike is in the hospital, Bill stays in Mike's house to look after Audra in hopes she will snap out of her catatonic state. The Losers gradually begin to forget about It, Derry, and each other. Mike's memory of his friends and events with It also begins to fade, as well as his Derry memoir and journal, much to his relief, and he considers starting a new life elsewhere. Before Bill leaves Derry, he takes Audra, still catatonic, for a ride on Silver, rushing through downtown Derry like he did as a kid. Audra awakens from her catatonia with no recollection of what happened upon arriving in Maine and she and Bill kiss.

==Characters==
{{original research section|date=April 2016}}

===The Losers Club===
The Losers Club is a group of seven eleven-year-old misfit children who are united by their unhappy lives. They share the same misery and torment from being the victims of a gang of local bullies led by the increasingly sociopathic Henry Bowers and band together as they struggle to overcome It. The seven children find themselves caught up in a nefarious situation, which they cannot quite comprehend but against which they must fight.

; William "Bill" Denbrough: Bill is the leader and most self-assured member of the Losers Club as well as the main protagonist of the story. Feeling responsible for Georgie's death, he seeks revenge on the monster. His parents have become cold and withdrawn towards him after the loss of their youngest son, and he secretly hopes the death of the murderer will awaken his parents to his presence again. He has a severe [[Stuttering|stutter]], which has earned him the nickname "Stuttering Bill". His mother attributes the stutter to a car accident that occurred when he was three years old, but his stutter is implied to be psychosomatic rather than physical: it worsens considerably after Georgie's death, and fades during his teenage years entirely, returning suddenly when Bill returns to Derry in 1985. He is the most determined and resourceful of the Losers and is their unofficial leader. It is Bill who eventually destroys It, engaging It in the Ritual of Chüd in both 1958 and 1985, and eventually killing It's physical form by ripping its heart out. As an adult, he becomes a successful writer and marries film star Audra Phillips, who bears a strong resemblance to Beverly.
; Benjamin "Ben" Hanscom: Known as "Haystack" to his friends, Ben is a highly intelligent boy who, before joining the Losers Club, often spent his free time reading books at the public library. Due to childhood obesity he was the favorite victim of Henry Bowers, but later sheds the weight as an adult. His mechanical skills prove useful to the Losers, from making two [[Silver bullet|silver slugs]] to building an underground clubhouse, and later attributes to his success as an internationally renowned architect. He develops a crush on Beverly Marsh as a child and the two leave Derry together after the 1985 defeat of It.
; Beverly "Bev" Marsh: An attractive and [[tomboy]]ish redhead on whom each of the boys has a secret crush at some point during the story. She is the only girl in the group and comes from the poorest part of Derry. During her childhood she is frequently abused by her father, Alvin, while her mother, Elfrida is out working. As an adult, she becomes a successful fashion designer in Chicago, but endures several abusive relationships, culminating in her marriage to Tom Rogan, who sees her as an object of sex and frequently beats her. Following the destruction of It, she leaves Derry with Ben.
; Richard "Richie" Tozier: Known as "Trashmouth", Richie is the Losers' self-appointed comic relief, always cracking jokes and doing impersonations or "Voices", which proves to be a very powerful weapon against It. He is " too intelligent for his own good" which frequently leads to trouble. He is the most devoted to keeping the group together, as he sees seven as a magical number and believes the group should have no more, no less. In adulthood, he is a successful disc jockey in Los Angeles. As the DJ, he uses his once-annoying and unrealistic voices as one of his main attractions. He is extremely nearsighted and wears thick glasses as a child, but changes to contact lenses as an adult. He loses his contact lenses in an encounter with It and is forced to return to his glasses, one of several ways the Losers return to their childhood. Although it is unclear if he was the basis of the character's name and occupation, [[Maine Public Radio]] has a music program hosted by a Rich Tozier.
; Edward "Eddie" Kaspbrak: Eddie is a frail and asthmatic hypochondriac, who carries his inhaler with him everywhere. His father died when he was very young, and his mother is domineering and constantly worries about his health. Later in the story, it is revealed that Eddie's asthma is [[psychosomatic]]: the pharmacist has been giving him water instead of medicine in his inhaler. The root of Eddie's problems is his mother, who has [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]]. Her constant worrying about his health has been a way to manipulate him into caring for her. When Henry and his friends break his arm, his mother tries to prevent the Losers from visiting Eddie in the hospital and he finally stands up to her, telling her he is not as helpless as she thinks. As an adult, he runs a successful limousine business in New York City and is married to a Myra, who is very similar to his mother. In his return to Derry as an adult, he also finds the strength to defend himself from Henry Bowers, killing him with a broken bottle. In the altercation, he re-breaks his arm in the same spot as he did as a child. When facing It in the sewers, his arm is bitten off and he bleeds to death, ultimately dying in Richie's arms.
; Michael "Mike" Hanlon: Mike is the last to join the Losers. He is the only African-American in the group and lives with his parents on a large farm. He goes to a different school from the other kids due to his [[Baptist]] faith. Mike is racially persecuted by Henry Bowers, whose father holds a long-standing grudge against Mike's father. Mike meets The Losers when they help him fight back against Bowers in a massive rock fight. His father kept an album filled with photos that were important to Derry's history, including several of Pennywise the Dancing Clown. He is the only one of the Losers to stay behind in Derry (and thus the only one to retain his memory of the events of 1958) and becomes the town librarian. He researches Derry history and It, and is the one who beckons the others back when the killings begin again in 1985. Though he survives, Mike is seriously wounded by Henry and is unable to join the remaining Losers (Bill, Ben, Bev, Eddie, and Richie) in the final battle against It. He later recovers from his wounds but, like the others, starts to lose his memory of the experience. It was later revealed in ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]'' that Mike continued as a librarian and was the boss of one of that book's primary characters in 1993.
; Stanley "Stan" Uris: Stan is the most skeptical member of the Club. He is [[Jewish]] and is persecuted by Henry Bowers for this reason. Logic, order, and cleanliness are deeply ingrained in his psyche. He relies on logic more than anything else and is the least willing to accept that It actually exists. As an adult, he becomes a partner in a large [[Atlanta]]-based accounting firm and marries Patty Blum, a teacher. Upon receiving Mike's phone call in 1985, he commits suicide by slitting his wrists in the bathtub and writing "IT" in his blood on the wall. It is heavily implied that Stan was the only one aware that It was not only female but was also pregnant, hence he chose death over returning to Derry to face the ancient terror despite being the one to slice the Losers palms in a [[blood brother|blood oath]]. It is also implied in the book that Stan remembers more about the children's encounters with It than the others do, sometimes commenting on the Turtle and other events from his time in Derry, though he claims that he doesn't remember what those phrases mean. It can be inferred throughout the story that he was psychic to a mild degree (accurately predicting which job his wife should apply for, a higher sensitivity to Its activities, frequent references from the other Losers to his "ordered mind"). Besides blaming It for Georgie's death, Bill also blames It for Stan's death.

===Pennywise/It===
{{main|It (character)}}

Described as a mysterious, prehistoric entity from beyond time and space, [[It (character)|It]] is a monster of unknown origin that preys on Derry's residents every twenty-seven years, stating It finds the fear in children akin to "salt(ing) the meat". Among It's powers is [[shapeshifting]] into a form that induces fear while killing the victim, normally assuming the form of a middle-aged man dressed in a [[clown]] costume, calling itself "''Pennywise the Dancing Clown''" and occasionally Bob or Robert Gray, modeled after [[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]], [[Clarabell the Clown|Clarabell]] and [[Ronald McDonald]].

It can also manipulate people and use them as pawns in doing its bidding, either by assuming a form most familiar to them, promising them their desires or through subliminal influence. Because of this control over what happens in Derry, many of the child murders It commits are never solved; the adults of Derry act as though either nothing is happening or they have forgotten about It. It's true form as perceived by the human eye is that of a giant spider that houses its essence: writhing orange lights (termed "Deadlights"). Looking directly into the lights can either kill a person or drive them insane.

Both It's awakening and its return to hibernation mark the greatest instances of violence during its time awake. In one example, It caused the disappearance of over three hundred settlers from Derry Township in 1740–43. In 1957, It awoke during a great storm which flooded part of the city, whereupon It went on a feeding spree, starting by killing Georgie Denbrough. However, the Losers Club forced It to return to an early hibernation when it was heavily wounded by the young Bill Denbrough in the first Ritual of Chüd. As the story opens, It has awakened approximately 27 years later and is first seen when three bullies beat up a homosexual couple, Adrian Mellon and Don Hagarty. It kills Adrian after the bullies throw him off of a bridge.

When the adult members of the Losers Club gather, It recognizes them as a threat and resolves to drive them away both through illusions and by seeking help from Henry Bowers, the Losers' long-time childhood bully. Bill, Richie, Beverly, Eddie, and Ben manage to confront It's spider form after It arranges to have Audra in its possession. It is finally killed in the second Ritual of Chüd, and an enormous storm damages the downtown part of Derry to symbolize It's death. In the novel ''[[Dreamcatcher (novel)|Dreamcatcher]]'', when Mr. Gray tries to put a worm in Derry's water by use of the Standpipe, It is no longer there due to the 1985 flood. In its place is a memorial featuring a cast-bronze statue of two children and a plaque underneath, dedicated to the victims of the 1985 flood and of It. The plaque has been vandalized with graffiti reading, "PENNYWISE LIVES".

The character has been named by several outlets as one of the scariest clowns in film or pop culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/29/the-10-most-terrifying-clowns-movies-film-tv|title=The 10 most terrifying clowns|last=Glenza|first=Jessica|date=October 29, 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/scariest-clowns-horror-movies/?view=all|title=10 Most Terrifying Clowns in Horror Movies|date=September 23, 2015|website=Screen Rant|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/the-scariest-clowns-in-pop-culture/|title=The Scariest Clowns in Pop Culture|date=October 22, 2015|website=Nerdist|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/1438566|title="Hey Kid, Want A Balloon?" – Horror's 5 Creepiest Clowns|last=Martin|first=Amy|website=Movie Pilot|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bowers Gang===
The Bowers Gang is a group of seven twelve-year-old neighborhood bullies who attend the same school as and are the worst enemies of the Losers Club after It. The gang is led by the crazed and mischievous Henry Bowers, while also being co-led by Henry's two best friends and sidekicks, the smarter and more moral Victor "Vic" Criss and the unusually larger, stronger, and more slow-witted Reginald "Belch" Huggins. Although the fates of three of them (Peter Gordon, Steve "Moose" Sadler, Gard Jagermeyer) were never made official, it is stated in the novel that the remaining child murders during the summer of 1958 after that of minor character Jimmy Cullum were of all of Henry's friends, creating the assumption that they were attacked and killed by It (possibly as means to worsen Henry's sociopathism).

; Henry Bowers: Henry Bowers is the [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] and crazed leader of the Bowers Gang who torments the Losers and other kids ceaselessly before and throughout the summer of 1958. The novel portrays him as a hateful and violent twelve-year-old boy filled with mischief and malice. Henry's sanity slowly deteriorates throughout the summer due to the influence of It and abuse from his equally crazy and abusive father, Butch Bowers, who has taught Henry to be a [[Racism|racist]]. Henry shares his father's intense hatred for the Hanlon family, the only black family in Derry, in addition to being a [[Sexism|sexist]], [[homophobia|homophobic]], and [[Anti-semitism|anti-semite]]. He inflicts many acts of cruelty and humiliation upon the Losers during and before the summer of '58, such as attempting to carve his name onto Ben Hanscom's stomach (though he only gets as far as the first letter), ceaselessly mocking Bill Denbrough's pronounced stutter, harassing Beverly and threatening her with sexual violence, killing Mike Hanlon's dog and bathing Mike in mud to make him a "tar baby", breaking Eddie Kaspbrak's arm, pursuing Richie Tozier through town, and white-washing Stan Uris' face in snow until it bleeds. His deteriorating sanity becomes apparent during his attacks on Eddie and Beverly: with the former, he pushed Mr. Gedreau to the ground and threatened him into going back inside the Tracker Bros. Store when the man tried to stand up for Eddie after Henry starts attacking Eddie with gravel; he kicked out an old lady's taillight when she tried to stand up for Beverly. After a violent rock fight in early July, Henry becomes increasingly sadistic until he eventually murders his father in mid-August with a switchblade provided by It, and also tries to kill the Losers. He chases them into the town sewers with his friends Vic Criss and Belch Huggins, only to encounter It in the form of Frankenstein's monster, who decapitates Vic and mutilates Belch's face. Henry fails to kill any of the Losers and manages to escape from It. When he eventually finds his way out of the sewers, the shock of witnessing his friends being slaughtered has driven him completely insane. He is convicted of the murder of his father and is framed for most of It's murders throughout the summer. He is placed in an insane asylum and remains there until May 29, 1985, when he escapes with It's assistance, and heads back to Derry to attempt to murder the Losers once more. After critically wounding Mike in the town library and being injured himself in the process, Henry then goes to the hotel where most of the Losers are staying, and finds Eddie's room first, only to be killed in the confrontation with Eddie.
; Victor "Vic" Criss: Vic Criss is a bully, and one of Henry's sidekicks. Among Henry's gang, Vic is most likely the smartest and most intelligent member and is the only one who truly realizes Henry's insanity, and becomes increasingly reluctant to follow him. The novel describes Vic as having good morals despite helping Henry torment the Losers, often wanting to scare or intimidate the Losers rather than actually cause physical harm. When he makes comments and jokes, he often uses heavy profanity as well as implied or explicit violence. It is also noted that he is a more than fair pitcher during the rock fight, where he causes the most damage (partly and somewhat paradoxically because he did not want to be there). In early August, while in the Tracker Brothers store, Vic warns the Losers of Henry's deteriorating sanity. He also almost approaches the Losers to join them but decides against it. By doing this, he seals his fate and joins Henry and Belch in following the Losers into the sewers, where the three encounter It in the form of Frankenstein's monster, who kills Vic by decapitating him. Later, It appears before Henry taking the form of Vic and Henry continually remembers Vic's decapitation. His corpse, along with Belch's, is later discovered by the adult Losers when they go to face It for the final time.
; Reginald "Belch" Huggins: Belch Huggins is the other sidekick of Henry's, and earned his nickname due to his ability to belch on command. He is very big for his age, being six feet tall at twelve years old. Belch is considered stupid by most people, which he makes up for in physical strength and his fierce loyalty to his friends, especially Henry. He's believed to be a professional grade baseball batter. Belch follows Henry and Vic into the sewers to murder the Losers, only to encounter It in the form of Frankenstein's monster. After It kills Vic and goes after Henry, Belch defends him and attacks It. Henry leaves Belch behind and It overpowers him and kills him by mutilating his face. It appears as a mutilated Belch to drive Henry to the hotel where the Losers are staying. During this encounter, Belch shows a great deal of resentment towards Henry, which uneases him. His corpse along with Vic's is later discovered by the adult Losers when they go to face It for the final time.
; Patrick Hockstetter: Patrick Hockstetter is a psychopathic and [[solipsistic]] bully who is part of Henry's gang (despite his generally low reputation, even as a bully). Patrick keeps a pencil box full of dead flies, which he kills with his ruler, and shows it to other students. He also takes small, usually injured animals and locks them in a broken refrigerator in a junkyard, and leaves them there to die. Along with killing animals, Patrick has also [[fratricide|murdered his infant brother]], Avery, by suffocation when he was five years old. When alone with Henry after lighting farts with him and his gang one July afternoon in 1958, Patrick gives Henry a [[handjob]] and offers to give him [[oral sex]], which snaps Henry out of his daze and prompts him to punch Patrick in the mouth. Henry then reveals that he knows about Patrick's refrigerator, and threatens to tell everyone about it if Patrick tells about the handjob. Once Henry has left, Patrick opens the refrigerator to dispose of the animal corpses but is attacked by a swarm of flying leeches, his only fear. The swarm sucks Patrick's blood leaving large holes all over his body, which causes him to slowly lose consciousness as he is dragged away by It. When he awakens, It begins to feed on him. His death is witnessed by Beverly, and his corpse is discovered by the Losers when they go into the sewers to face It for the first time.
; Peter Gordon: A well-off friend of Henry's that lives on West Broadway, who thinks of chasing Mike Hanlon as a game, though Henry's crazed and increasingly violent behavior (such as attempting to outright kill Mike with cherry bombs and [[M-80 (explosive)|M-80]]s) begins to alienate him. He's also the boyfriend of an unattractive girl with heavy acne named Marcia Fadden. When school goes out for the summer, Peter (menacingly) invites Ben Hanscom to play baseball with him and while on a date with Marcia, he insults the Losers at the movies. Like Vic Criss, he also realizes Henry's eroding sanity, albeit only after the rock fight. He is never seen again after the rock fight.
; Steve "Moose" Sadler: A slightly developmentally disabled and very slow friend of Henry's, whose father works on the Hanlon family farm. He joins Henry in tormenting Mike Hanlon and also helps him break Eddie's arm in the park. However, Moose is shown to be more of a minion or a follower to Henry rather than a friend and is more of a friend to Vic and Belch.
; Gard Jagermeyer: A very slow and dumb friend of Henry's. He once pushed Richie Tozier to the ground, breaking his glasses. Aside from this instance, Gard is mentioned a few times throughout the novel, arguably making him the most minor of Henry's gang.

===Other characters===
; George "Georgie" Denbrough: The first character introduced in the book. He is the six-year-old brother of Bill Denbrough, and he goes out to sail his boat made from a sheet of newspaper only for it to be swept into a storm drain. Seconds later Pennywise appears and tempts him with balloons and circus food. Georgie says no and as Georgie reaches for the boat, Pennywise grabs him and rips his arm off, whispering to him 'they float' while he bleeds to death.
; Eddie Corcoran: Eddie Corcoran is a classmate of the Losers Club and Henry's gang. Like Beverly Marsh, Eddie and his younger brother Dorsey are victims of child abuse by their stepfather, Richard Macklin. Eddie's stepfather would often beat both boys brutally and without warning, at one point throwing Eddie into a coat rack with enough force to make him [[Hematuria|urinate blood]] for two weeks for accidentally slamming the door while Macklin was sleeping. In May 1957, Macklin hit Dorsey in the back of the head with a hammer, accidentally killing him, which he covered up to look like an accident. Two days before summer vacation in June 1958, Eddie runs away from home and decides to rest in the park. However, using Dorsey's form, It approaches Eddie and chases after him before assuming the form of the [[Gill-man]] to kill him. Eddie is the only child who is actually shown getting killed by It besides George Denbrough and Patrick Hockstetter.
; Adrian Mellon: Adrian Mellon is a young homosexual man in Derry. He grows fond of the town, despite its violently homophobic mindset, and only agrees to leave to please his partner, Don Hagarty. Before leaving, however, the two attend a town fair in July 1984, and on the way home, they are harassed by three gay-hating youths. The three attack them, Adrian especially because of a hat he won at the fair, and [[Charlie Howard (murder victim)|throw him from a bridge over a canal]]. When he hits the bottom, Adrian is attacked by Pennywise as It briefly pressured his ribs until he shrieked, and dragged him away to kill. Though Don and one of the bullies, Chris Unwin, witnessed this, no mention of Pennywise is made at the trial.
; Greta Bowie: Greta Bowie is a rich snobby girl from West Broadway and a Social Studies classmate of Ben Hanscom and Beverly Marsh, as well as Eddie Kasprak's neighbor. While revisiting his old neighborhood, Eddie learns from an encounter with It that Greta had died in a vehicle accident when she was 18 and under the influence of drugs. Eddie also mentions he had a crush on her when he was younger, liking her blonde hair.
; Bradley Donovan: Bradley Donovan is a friend of Bill Denbrough's, who often accompanies him to speech therapy in Bangor as he suffers from a lisp. Bradley is described as being childish and immature, particularly shown towards Beverly when he suspected her to be cheating at a game they were playing with Eddie Kaspbrak and Ben Hanscom. Bradley goes unmentioned for the remainder of the book after running away after insulting Beverly's mother, making his fate unclear.
; Will Hanlon: Will Hanlon is the father of Mike Hanlon. While dying of cancer in 1962, he tells Mike about his experiences in the Army Air Corps in the 1920s and about establishing the Black Spot, a club started by Will and his black Air Force buddies and originally meant exclusively for black members, but gradually began accepting members of other races as well. He recounts how, in the fall of 1930, the club was burned down by a group of Maine Legion of White Decency members, causing numerous deaths. He narrowly survived the fire due to the intervention of his friend Dick Halloran, a character who also appears in King's ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''. He also tells Mike that he witnessed a giant bird - the same bird that nearly killed Mike in 1958 — carry off a Legion of White Decency member and fly away with him in its talons.
; Norbert Keene: The owner and operator of the Center Street Drug Store for fifty years, from 1925 to 1975. The Losers dislike him, thinking of him as cruel and snide. He administers Eddie's asthma medication and later reveals to him, for unclear motives, that it is only a placebo ordered by his mother. Many years later, when Keene is 85 and retired, Mike interviews him, and Mr. Keene tells him the story of the Bradley Gang, a group of outlaws who were hiding out in Maine after several bank robberies in the Midwest. He tells Mike that, in 1929, a year before the fire at the Black Spot, the entire gang was murdered by Derry residents when stopping through town to buy ammunition. Mr. Keene says that, rather than covering up the event, the whole town instead pretended that it never occurred, including police chief Jim Sullivan, who even took part in the slayings. Finally, Mr. Keene mentions seeing a clown participating in the shooting, but that it was wearing farmer's attire rather than a traditional clown suit. He speculates that the clown was in fact a disguised member of the Derry citizenry or possibly a performer from a nearby carnival, but cannot explain reports out that the clown was seen at several different places at once and that it cast no shadow. 
; Tom Rogan: The insane, abusive, violent and [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] husband of Beverly Marsh. Tom has a very predatory view of women, and he thrives on the control he has over his vulnerable wife. When Beverly tries to leave for Derry, he refuses to let her, whipping her with a belt. Tom is surprised when the normally docile Beverly fights back and almost kills him. He follows Beverly to Derry with the intent of killing her, but is manipulated by It to kidnap Bill's wife, Audra, instead. He later dies from shock after seeing It's true form.
; Alvin Marsh: Beverly Marsh's abusive father. Although he is not an alcoholic or drug user, he abuses Bev and her mother and acts [[Misogyny|misogynistically]], though there are times when Alvin is shown to be a loving and caring father to Bev. As an adult, Beverly falls out of contact with her father, and when she returns to Derry in 1985, she discovers he has died five years before.
; Kay McCall: Beverly Marsh's close friend, a divorcee and an affluent writer of feminist literature. Beverly turns to her when fleeing her husband Tom. She is brutally assaulted by Tom, who successfully extracts all she knows about his missing wife's whereabouts.
; Audra Philips Denbrough: Bill's wife, a famous film actress who bears a marked resemblance to Beverly. She follows Bill to Derry due to her concern over his mental state and is kidnapped by Tom Rogan, who is acting on It's orders. She becomes [[catatonic]] after seeing It's true form, but Bill revives her by taking her on a ride on his childhood bike Silver. She is the only person who has survived after seeing It's true form.
; Zack and Sharon Denbrough: Bill and Georgie's father and mother. Initially loving and supportive parents, they become distant from their son and from each other in their grief over Georgie's death, and Bill's hope of regaining their love is one of his biggest motives in fighting It. Zack, an electrician for a hydroelectric firm, has knowledge of Derry's sewer system that becomes instrumental in helping Bill determine where It can be found. Both have died by the time the Losers reunite in 1985.
; Sonia Kaspbrak: Eddie's mother. A morbidly obese widow, she has convinced herself that Eddie is seriously ill with multiple illnesses including asthma, despite repeatedly assurances from doctors and teachers that he is basically healthy. She uses her son's health as a way of controlling him, refusing to let him participate in physical activities (which Eddie enjoys) and limiting his contact with friends. Eddie is terrified of upsetting her, but manages to stand up to her after she blames his friends for Henry Bowers breaking his arm. She dies in 1980, by which point she weighs over 400 pounds.
; The Turtle: This ancient turtle is said to have vomited out our Universe when he had a stomach ache. He is kind, wise, loving, gentle, compassionate and benevolent, having a very grandfather-like demeanor when speaking to humans. In 1958, he communicates with Bill Denbrough while he is under an illusion created by IT. Bill pleads for help in defeating IT and the Turtle simply gives Bill advice that he must stand by his friends and perform the Ritual of Chüd. During the second Ritual of Chüd in 1985, It tells Bill that the Turtle has since died by "choking on a galaxy", but it is ambiguous as to whether or not this is true.

{{nihongo|'''Jiro Sato'''|佐藤 次郎|Satō Jirō|{{IPA-ja|sa.toː dʑi.ɾoː}}; January 5, 1908 – April 5, 1934}} was a Japanese [[tennis]] player. He was ranked World No. 3 in 1933, but committed suicide in the [[Strait of Malacca]] during his trip to the [[Davis Cup]] in 1934.&lt;ref name="sportsill"&gt;{{cite journal

He received worldwide fame in Wimbledon 1932, when he beat the defending champion [[Sidney Wood]] at the quarterfinal. In the semifinal, he lost to [[Bunny Austin]]. His peak came in 1933, when he beat [[Fred Perry]] in the [[French Open]] quarterfinal. He was ranked World No. 3 by [[A.

It is believed that pressure drove him to throw himself overboard into the [[Strait of Malacca]] on April 5, 1934, at 26 years of age.&lt;ref name="sportsill" /&gt;

==Tennis career==
He debuted on the international tennis scene in 1929 when the touring [[Racing Club de Paris]] visited Japan for a series of exhibition matches. He notably defeated tennis legends [[Jacques Brugnon]], [[Raymond Rodel]] and [[Pierre Henri Landry]], only losing to [[Henri Cochet]].&lt;ref name="tennis&amp;golf5"&gt;{{cite journal|editor=Béla Kehrling|editor-link=Béla von Kehrling|title=Külföldi hírek|trans-title=International news|url=http://epa.oszk.hu/02100/02127/00015/pdf/EPA02127_tennis_es_golf_1929_1_015-016.pdf|format=PDF|issue=15-16|volume=I|pages=349|journal=Tennisz és Golf|date=December 25, 1929|publisher=Egyesült Kő-, Könyvnyomda.

In 1930 he was the runner-up for the Japanese championships, which he finally did win the next year.&lt;ref name="Straits" /&gt;  Also in 1930 he was a runner-up for the Mid-Pacific Invitational tournament losing to American [[Cranston Holman]] and the doubles final as well.&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{cite journal|author=|authorlink=|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/berkeley-daily-gazette/1930-04-02/page-11/|page=11|journal=[[Berkeley Daily Gazette]]|issue=|date=April 2, 1930|title=Lacoste captures British net title|location=Berkeley, California|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="berkeley2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=|authorlink=|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/berkeley-daily-gazette/1930-04-01/page-13/|page=13|journal=[[Berkeley Daily Gazette]]|issue=|date=April 1, 1930|title=Lacoste captures British net title|location=Berkeley, California|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1931 to 1933 Sato played in ten ties for the Japanese [[Davis Cup]] team and won 22 rubbers and lost only six, compiling a 79% winning record.

===Playing style===
Sato played with a flat forehand drive which he modeled after [[Henri Cochet]] when Cochet visited Japan in 1929. He hit the ball on the forehand side early after the bounce and he was an excellent volleyer.&lt;ref name=brady&gt;{{cite book|last=Brady|first=Maurice|title=The Encyclopedia of Lawn Tennis|year=1958|publisher=Robert Hale Ltd.|location=London|pages=118, 119|edition=1|oclc=26127|isbn=9780498074684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in the day he complained of stomach pains and thus had no appetite and kept to his cabin. He considered leaving the ship at [[Singapore]], which he did for a medical examination.  The exam revealed no reasons for his health problems and it was concluded that his problems were psychological. Sato was nervous and feared that his illness would be an obstacle for his team to win. As the day passed, the [[Japan Davis Cup team]] was given a banquet hosted by the Japanese consul to Singapore. Sato was present and was further pushed by the consul and his teammates to proceed with the trip and sail to Europe. That same day a cable was received from the [[Japanese Lawn Tennis Association]] insisting on Sato's participation in the Davis Cup and that the voyage should be resumed without delay.&lt;ref name="sportsill" /&gt;

At 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on April 5, 1934, before reaching [[Penang]], Sato was found missing by his compatriot [[Jiro Yamagishi]].&lt;ref name="sportsill" /&gt; The last time he was seen was at 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. when he had dinner in his cabin.&lt;ref name="Straits"&gt;{{cite journal|author=|authorlink=|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19340407.2.49.aspx|page=11|journal=[[The Straits Times]]|issue=|date=April 7, 1934|title=Thought he was burden to his colleagues|location=Singapore, Straits Settlements|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He left two suicide notes, one to his Japanese tennis teammates expressing doubts that he would be able to help the team in the upcoming contest. He begged them to forgive him and do their best to prevail in the match. He promised he would be with his colleagues in spirit.&lt;ref name="sportsill" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TheMail" /&gt;  The other note was addressed to the ship's captain, apologizing for the inconveniences that his actions might cause. A search for him continued for seven more hours and the vessel hovered in the strait.&lt;ref name="sportsill" /&gt; Wireless messages were sent to nearby ships.&lt;ref name="Straits" /&gt; Later further evidence was found which confirmed the suicide theory. Two iron davit-winding handles and a training skip-rope were missing, which Sato probably used to tie weights on himself to make sure he would drown. After discovery of the new evidence, the ship sent out a radio message stating that "Japan's finest tennis player and national hero was believed to have committed suicide by throwing himself overboard". On April 6, a prayer was ministered by his friends who assembled on the deck of the ship.&lt;ref name="sportsill" /&gt; An altar was built on board with photographs and racquets of Sato around it.&lt;ref name="TheMail" /&gt;  Also a traditional Japanese "cake offering" ceremony was held.&lt;ref name="Straits" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TheMail" /&gt;  It was speculated that the pressure on him came from the growing prestige of the [[Japanese Empire]] and from the Japanese Lawn Tennis Association who refused to allow the exhausted Sato to have a break from tennis and skip the 1934 season. He became depressed and concerned about his abilities.&lt;ref name="sportsill" /&gt;

Several world class players reacted to the event. [[Fred Perry]] said that Sato was "one of the cheeriest men he had ever known". [[Bunny Austin]] added that "He had a great sense of humor...He always gave the impression that he would be the last man on earth to come to such an end". [[Ryuki Miki]] took over as captain of the Davis Cup team and went on to win the [[1934 Wimbledon Championships]] mixed doubles title the same year.  Miki stated Sato was a joyful person who loved jokes and making people laugh. His fiancée recalled that Sato hoped he could stay at [[Singapore]]. She further added: "I believe Jiro committed suicide solely from a sense of responsibility after he had acceded to the tennis association's urgings to proceed to Europe, even when he wanted to return from Singapore. To the end of my life I shall regret that it was the order of the Japanese Lawn Tennis Association that resulted in his death. Jiro was a man of honor and he played every time for the honor of Japan."&lt;ref name="sportsill" /&gt; His brother [[Hyotare Sato]] addressed a call for the Japanese team to not cancel their match and to fight their hardest.&lt;ref name="TheMail" /&gt;

'''Jules Irving''' (né '''Julius Israel'''; April 13, 1925 – July 28, 1979) was an American actor, director, educator, and producer, who in the 1950s co-founded the [[Actor's Workshop|San Francisco Actor's Workshop]]. When the Actor's Workshop closed in 1966, Irving moved to New York City and became the first Producing Director of the Repertory Company of the [[Vivian Beaumont Theater]] of [[Lincoln Center]].

In 1955, the Actor's Workshop was the first West Coast theater to sign an Equity "[[Off-Broadway]]" contract. Irving had started the Workshop with fellow New Yorker [[Herbert Blau]], whom he knew from undergraduate days at [[New York University]] and then during graduate study at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Keith, [http://drs.library.yale.edu:8083/HLTransformer/HLTransServlet?stylename=yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&amp;pid=arts:dra.0027&amp;query=&amp;clear-stylesheet-cache=yes&amp;hlon=yes&amp;big=&amp;adv=&amp;filter=&amp;hitPageStart=&amp;sortFields=&amp;view=c01_1#s1 ''A History of the San Francisco Actor's Workshop'' (1969)], Yale Drama Library; accessed June 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men were both professors at San Francisco State, Irving, in the Drama department and Blau in English.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Irving was from childhood deeply involved in theater, supported in this by his family along with his older brother Richard, despite a degree of religious reservation inculcated by bizarre bearded Russian/Yiddish-speaking rabbinical teachers that dis-inspired what Irving called a "lost generation" of the children of Jewish immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Noted in a typewritten essay, "Profile: The Talented Professor," by S.F. State student Margaret Wood, based on interviews with Irving, n.d. [c. 1950], in the papers of Jules Irving at Lincoln Center&lt;/ref&gt;

He was active in school shows and made his Broadway debut at the age of thirteen in [[George S. Kaufman]]'s ''The American Way''. He joined the army in 1943, serving in the infantry during the [[Battle of the Bulge]] and as a Russian translator when his unit met Soviet forces. After [[V-E Day]], he transferred to Special Services and had the opportunity to hone his theater managerial skills as he organized camp shows under [[Joshua Logan]].&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==San Francisco Actor's Workshop, 1952–1966==
From its inception on January 16, 1952 in a loft above a [[judo]] academy on Divisadero Street in [[San Francisco]] to its formal demise in 1966, the Actor's Workshop set new standards as a pioneer of resident professional art theater in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, p. 820&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those present in 1952 for a "study group" or "workshop" were Irving, Blau, their wives, [[Priscilla Pointer]] and Beatrice Manley; Hal J. Todd, who had been at Stanford with Irving and Blau; Richard Glyer, an instructor at [[San Francisco State University]]; Paul Cox, an aspiring playwright; and S.F. State student Dan Whiteside.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Irving was "managing director"; he shared artistic leadership with Blau.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Irving guided the theater's finances and led primary day-by-day operations of the company's growth to its Elgin Street playhouse and then to offices on Folsom Street and two year-round theaters, the Encore and the Marines' Memorial. A major transition occurred in 1956 when the Workshop was evicted from Elgin Street to make room for a new freeway. The company had an option to renew its lease on the [[Marines' Memorial Club|Marines' Memorial Theater]] but no money. A young Canadian, [https://www.backstage.com/news/actors-we-love-alan-mandell-waiting-for-no-one/ Alan Mandell], who as volunteer Business Manager (and ''de facto'' chief executive with Irving) helped inaugurate  the first subscription season for the Actor's Workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, 205ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irving and Blau were insistent idealists who developed the Workshop in the tradition of the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] of the 1930s; they and key company members were dedicated to principles of social responsibility and ensemble artistry.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; The troupe's repertoire focused initially on Miller and other modern American writers, such as Odets, O'Neill, and Tennessee Williams, but soon expanded to the contemporary world dramas of Samuel Beckett, Brecht, Genet, John Osborne, Yukio Mishima, and Harold Pinter.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, see play lists in chapter headings&lt;/ref&gt;

Respected as an actor as well as director, Irving played major roles, including Proctor in ''[[The Crucible]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Hagan, R.H., "Powerful New Drama Enacted With Rare Skill," ''S.F. Chronicle'', December 8, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; and Happy in ''Death of a Salesman'' &lt;ref&gt;Blau, Herbert, "A Play for Americans," program note for ''Death of a Salesman,'' February 26, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; (which he also directed) in the Workshop's productions of [[Arthur Miller]] plays. When the Workshop produced the west coast premiere of Beckett's ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', Irving was the loquacious servant, Lucky.&lt;ref&gt;Blau, "Who is Godot?," program for ''Waiting for Godot'', February 28, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production played to the Workshop's regular audiences, then performed for inmates at San Quentin prison &lt;ref&gt;The Workshop visit had a lasting effect.  San Quentin inmates formed a drama club, and Alan Mandell became the group's advisor.  In its final season, the Workshop presented a play by ex-inmate [[Rick Cluchey]], [[The Cage (play)|The Cage]], at the Encore.  It toured to New York and elsewhere later &lt;br/&gt;Kaltenheuser, Skip, "The Prison Playwright", ''Gadfly OnLine,'' Sep-Oct 1999.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Atkinson|first=Brooks|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1958/08/06/79446020.pdf|title=Theatre - 'Godot' for Fair - Coast Troupe Here on Way to Brussels|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=1958-08-06|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, Brooks, "Theater: 'Godot' For Fair", ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 6, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gleason, Gene, "[[Waiting For Godot]] ... At the York", ''New York Herald Tribune'', August 6, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; and on to the 1958 Brussels World's Fair where it represented American theater under the aegis of the US State Department. [[File:1957a Waiting for Godot 2.jpg|thumb|left|Irving as Lucky in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', 1957]]

The travel to Brussels was not without incident. Irving was informed that the Workshop would need to fund its own travel to get to Belgium. After weeks of fund-raising and while the company was still in New York, he received word that it would be "inadvisable" for a particular stage manager {{Who|date=June 2017}} to travel on to Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; The opaque State Department communications left Irving and Blau to speculate while officials would not go on record that perhaps some liberal activity had brought negative attention down on the respected company member. The Workshop protested but in the end, feeling a responsibility to San Franciscans who had provided travel funds, proceeded to Brussels with Pointer replacing the stage manager for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Priscilla Pointer replaced the stage manager for the performances at the Fair. Word quickly spread to the media, and ''The San Francisco Examiner'' ran a banner headline on September 15, 1958, "U.S.Ban On S.F. Theater Man", and all other local dailies ran prominent front page stories. See Fowler, ch. XL,259, for detail on "L'Affaire Godot".&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his acclaimed abilities as the director of such Workshop productions as ''The Entertainer'', ''Misalliance'', ''The Glass Menagerie'', and ''The Caretaker'', Irving proved his skills as a financial manager over many years, shrewdly learning "by necessity," according to San Francisco writer [[Mark Harris (author)|Mark Harris]], "a hundred-and-one uses for the pennies of a dollar."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Mark, [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1965/02/21/118693278.pdf "Blau &amp; Irving Come Out of the West"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 21, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; In the world of theatrical idealism, chary vigilance is absolutely necessary, as the economics of the performing arts in our time require deficit funding to a greater degree every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc.edu/uscpress/books/2010/3907x.pdf |format=PDF |title=Commercial Theaters versus Not-for-Profit Theaters |website=Sc.edu |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irving always had to struggle to keep the Workshop solvent. In doing so, he protected the company's artistic independence. He was thus extremely cautious in the late 1950s when the [[Ford Foundation]] offered its hand.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Ch XIII, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars note that Irving's life offers a study in artistic morality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcrecord.org/Content.asp?ContentId=2283|title=TCRecord: Article|first=Michael|last=Rennick|website=www.tcrecord.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stageleft-movie.com/tag/jules-irving tage "ACTFinds its Home in San Francisco], stageleft.com; accessed June 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; although the "message" of any particular ethical exchange (Workshop v. State Department, Workshop v. Ford, v. Lincoln Center, v. ACT?) may remain unclear. A secular Jew,&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, p. 17; "Following his Bar Mitzvah, Irving ceased all formal practice of his religion and became, through this default, a member of what he terms 'the lost generation of American Jews' i.e., young Jews unable to believe in the relevance of Judaism's arcane and ancient rites to modern American life."&lt;/ref&gt; Irving was honored with the Methodist-oriented Danforth Fellowship early in his professorial career for interests and achievements in "religion and higher education". {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 1957, Irving began interacting with the Ford Foundation. At that time, the Foundation's Humanities and Arts Program offered grants-in-aid to "creative and performing artists", et al&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; and the Workshop stood to benefit. Over time Irving developed a relationship with the Foundation as a consultant who advised fledgling theaters on survival and growth throughout the nation.  Of particular note is his travel to Mississippi in the early '60s to work as an advisor to the [[Free Southern Theater]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amistadresearchcenter.org/archon/?p=creators/creator&amp;id=109 |title=Free Southern Theater (1963-1978)|publisher=[[Amistad Research Center]]|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a racially integrated troupe presenting ''Waiting for Godot'' amid a "beligerant, racist" atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, p. 750&lt;/ref&gt; Irving's relationship with the Ford Foundation offered important lessons in the ethics and effects of philanthropic intervention in non-profit enterprises within a free market system.&lt;ref&gt;See Fowler, especially chapters XIII (p. 342) through XXI (p. 684)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lincoln Center, 1965–1972==
The Workshop and its directors rose in national prominence for thirteen years until, in 1965, Irving and Blau were appointed to the artistic leadership at the Repertory Company in the Vivian Beaumont Theater of Lincoln Center.  Several key actors were invited to accompany them to New York to form the nucleus of a repertory troupe. The direction of the Actor's Workshop was assumed by Kenneth Kitch and John Hancock,&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, chapter XXIV, including interviews with Kitch.&lt;/ref&gt; who managed to keep the company going,&lt;ref&gt;Knickerbocker, Paine, "What is Heartbreaking Is That It Came So Close to Success", ''San Francisco  Chronicle'' ("Datebook" section), July 31, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; despite dwindling audiences, through the summer of 1966 when the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce rejected an appeal for aid from the company.  The Chamber instead offered a financial incentive to [[William Ball (director)|William Ball]]'s [[American Conservatory Theater]] to become the city's resident company.&lt;ref&gt;Knickerbocker, P. "The City is Offered a Repertory Theater", ''San Francisco Chronicle'', July 29, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irving and Blau were back in their home city.&lt;ref&gt;Pace, Eric, [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70810FF385D12728DDDA80B94DF405B898BF1D3&amp;scp=6&amp;sq=Lincoln%20Center%20eric%20pace&amp;st=cse  "Jules Irving, Director of Lincoln Center Theater, Dead"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 31, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; After a rocky reception to their initial efforts, particularly to Blau's production of ''Danton's Death,'' &lt;ref&gt;Fowler, 797ff&lt;/ref&gt; Blau resigned, but Irving was retained by the Lincoln Center board.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, p. 800&lt;/ref&gt; He steadily built the repertory company for the next seven years, concentrating mainly on his responsibilities and leadership as producer after personally directing some of the strongest early productions, including the powerful 1966 ''[[Caucasian Chalk Circle]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lct.org/content/lctreview/50%20Years%20215%20Productions.pdf |title=Archived copy|accessdate=2012-03-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109113725/http://www.lct.org/content/lctreview/50%20Years%20215%20Productions.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=3135|title=The Caucasian Chalk Circle – Broadway Play – Original - IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League|website=Ibdb.com|accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;With Elizabeth Huddle as Grusha. A note from Yale doctoral historian Keith Fowler's diary: "This hearty, colorful production may have appeared in its finest light at the Sunday matinee on April 10--Easter in 1966 -- when, as the Singer, the magnificent Brock Peters led us into Scene Two by gesturing a wide welcome and ringing out, 'On Easter Sunday morning!'"&lt;/ref&gt;

While nurturing the acting and directing corps, he embraced at times certain "star" productions of quality, such as Mike Nichols' celebrated revival of [[Lillian Hellman]]'s ''[[The Little Foxes]]'' and Gordon Davidson's staging of ''[[In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer]]''.  Irving understood that in New York no cultural institution may function well in isolation, so he reached out even to commercial productions of poetic and idealistic themes, e.g., Brian Friel's ''Lovers''.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Walter, [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/11/12/91353864.pdf REVIEW], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 12, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; He ended his regime at Lincoln Center in 1972 with [[Ellis Rabb]]'s widely celebrated direction of [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''Enemies''&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Clive, [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/11/10/79478696.pdf "The Theater: Rising to the Occasion"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 10, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; with a cast that included several actors who had come with Irving years earlier from San Francisco.

Irving concluded a little over three decades in live theater when he left Lincoln Center.His was a remarkable career by any standard, not overlooking, as his widow [[Priscilla Pointer]] notes, his unflagging care and attention to raising their family of three children. He and his family moved to Southern California where Ms. Pointer, long a major actress with the Actor's Workshop and Lincoln Center, found opportunity to flourish in film roles, and where their daughter [[Amy Irving]], who began her acting career at age nine on the Workshop stage, would carry on the family name.Irving produced television revivals of classic films, including ''Dark Victory'' and directed ''Loose Change'' and the celebrated series,'' Rich Man, Poor Man''. As producer of the Lincoln Center original, he is credited for Masterpiece Theater's televised version of ''Enemies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207452/|title="Great Performances" Enemies (TV Episode 1974)|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pace, E., 07/31/79&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1979 on a vacation trip to [[Reno, Nevada]], aged 54.&lt;ref&gt;Pace&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1947, Irving married actress [[Priscilla Pointer]], to whom he remained married until his death in 1979. The couple had two children, director David Irving and actress [[Amy Irving]]. Pointer remarried a year later in 1980 to [[Robert Symonds]], who had been Irving's producing partner at [[Lincoln Center]].

'''Julie Rowe''' is an American author, public speaker and member of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). She had a [[near-death experience]] (NDE) in 2004 in which she claimed she visited the [[spirit world (Latter Day Saints)|spirit world]] and was shown many things, including upcoming world calamities.&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/09/26/sunday-nights-blood-moon-prediction-irksome-some-mormons/72883024/|title=Sunday night's blood moon prediction irksome for Mormon Church|publisher=usatoday.com|accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heraldextra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/lds/lds-church-releases-statement-on-blood-moon-speculation/article_53a60c25-0597-519e-823a-d31f84f709f1.html|title=LDS Church releases statement on "Blood Moon" speculation|publisher=heraldextra.com|accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowe has written three books. Her current book, ''From Tragedy to Destiny'', was released in February 2016. Her writings and [[Fireside (LDS Church)|fireside]] messages have been interpreted as encouraging spiritual and emergency preparations, such as food storage, before signs of the end times, such as the "[[Blood moon prophecy|blood moon]]" from the [[September 2015 lunar eclipse]].  An LDS Church press release at that time stated that it encourages emergency preparations and self-reliance during disasters and hardships, but discourages "extreme efforts" and some recent "writings and speculations of individual Church members," which "do not reflect Church doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Brady McCombs | title=Mormon church issues statement about lunar eclipse apocalypse | work=Christian Science Monitor (AP) | date=September 26, 2015 | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2015/0926/Mormon-church-issues-statement-about-lunar-eclipse-apocalpyse | accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LDS [[Church Education System]] placed Rowe's book ''A Greater Tomorrow'' on a list of spurious materials to teachers of [[Seminary (LDS Church)|seminaries]] and to [[Institutes of Religion]] and stated, "Although Sister Rowe is an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, her book is not endorsed by the church and should not be recommended to students or used as a resource in teaching them. The experiences she shares are her own personal experiences and do not necessarily reflect Church doctrine or they may distort Church doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Spurious Materials in Circulation| date=August 31, 2015| orig-year=2009| publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Seminaries and Institutes of Religion| url=https://si.lds.org/bc/seminary/content/binary-content/binary-content/news-tim-gurr/publication_caution---a_greater_tomorrow_my_journey_beyond_the_veil_04-statements-in-circulation3831.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some media outlets{{who|date=November 2015}} have interpreted this as a condemnation of Rowe's books by the LDS Church, as this was guidance that her books would not be used as a resource for teaching curriculum.

'''The Lady of the Hills''' is a name given by the media to the body of an unknown female discovered in 2004 on the mountain [[Pen-y-ghent]] in [[Yorkshire and the Humber|Yorkshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cravenherald.co.uk/news/11483954.No_new_leads_in___39_Lady_of_the_Hills__39__mystery/|title=No new leads in 'Lady of the Hills' mystery|last=Moore|first=Lindsey|date=19 September 2014|website=Craven Herald|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman was found to have originally come from somewhere in [[Southeast Asia|South-East Asia]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and despite an international police investigation, the identity of the woman, how she arrived at the location and the cause of her death remain a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/news/16350624.cold-case-review-team-turn-to-social-media-to-identify-woman/|title=Police cold case review team turn to social media to identify woman whose body was found in Dales|last=Brooke-Battersby|first=Jack|date=20 July 2018|website=The Westmorland Gazette|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
On Monday 20 September 2004 at 11:30&amp;nbsp;am, a man walking in the vicinity of [[Pen-y-ghent]] alerted the police to the discovery of the body of a dead woman.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/3675712.stm|title=Woman's body discovered in stream|last=Staff|first=|date=21 September 2004|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man had discovered the body in a well-trafficked location on the [[Pennine Way]] between Pen-y-ghent and [[Horton in Ribblesdale]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/4259788.stm|title=Mystery of Dales body unresolved|last=Staff|first=|date=19 September 2005|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a stream called Sell Gill [[Beck (stream)|Beck]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which flows into a cave called  Sell Gill Hole.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/3709582.stm|title=Villagers quizzed over moors body|last=Staff|first=|date=2 October 2004|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought that the body had been in the stream for some time&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and that the woman could have died up to three weeks prior to the discovery.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/riddle-of-dales-body-unsolved-seven-years-on-1-3789282|title=Riddle of Dales body unsolved seven years on|last=Staff|first=|date=21 September 2011|work=The Yorkshire Post|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of death was not initially apparent and no signs of violence were reported.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Description ==
The woman was thought to be of South-East Asian origin,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; had dark, shoulder-length hair &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and was about 1.5 metres tall (4ft 11ins)&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/13/police-seek-to-identify-woman-found-dead-in-yorkshire-dales-in-2014|title=Police seek to identify woman found dead in Yorkshire Dales in 2004|last=Pidd|first=Helen|date=23 July 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;. She was believed to be aged between 25 and 35.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The woman had healthy teeth which had a noticeable gap at the front.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; She was found wearing green jeans, a green and white striped T-shirt&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/4292449.stm|title=National appeal over Dales body|last=Staff|first=|date=23 February 2005|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was wearing a wedding ring.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The ring was found to be 22 carat and to have been made in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.grough.co.uk/magazine/2018/07/12/police-launch-international-social-media-campaign-to-solve-pennine-way-body-mystery#|title=Police launch international social media campaign to solve Pennine Way body mystery|last=Smith|first=Bob|date=12 July 2018|website=www.grough.co.uk|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman had pierced ears but no earrings were found.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; No shoes, warm outer clothing, personal bags of other effects were found at the scene of the discovery.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The woman weighed {{convert|10|st|kg}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but appeared to have gained weight in the years prior to her death and wore a size 12 dress.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  

== Initial investigation ==
Immediately after the discovery, [[North Yorkshire Police]] commenced an extensive investigation. Police questioned walkers using the Pennine Way, conducted house-to-house enquires in the locality and issued letters to local holiday accommodations that appealed for witnesses in multiple languages.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Police investigated every sighting in the [[Yorkshire Dales]] of women matching the description of the unidentified body dating back to 1 August 2004.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

A postmortem was undertaken which suggested the woman died between 31 August and 13 September but it did not provide enough information to enable investigators to establish the cause of death.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The postmortem indicated that the woman had probably been pregnant at some point during her life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Detective Chief Inspector Pete Martin who was working on the investigation stated that the death was unexplained rather than suspicious.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A search of missing persons databases did not produce any matches.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A number of countries were identified as the potential origin of the woman. These countries included: [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]],  [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Analysis of the body indicated that the woman had been in the UK for at least two years prior to her death and that she had probably lived in [[Cumbria]],  [[Lancashire]], or the west [[Yorkshire Dales]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Subsequent investigations ==
In December 2004 the Police produced an [[E-FIT|e-fit]] photograph of the woman which was issued to the embassies of a number of Asian countries.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/north_yorkshire/4102353.stm|title=Embassies help in Dales mystery|last=Staff|first=|date=16 December 2004|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time time it was believed that the woman could have originated from [[Philippines|the Philippines]], [[China]] or [[Korea]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; No meaningful response was received from this appeal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In February 2005 an appeal was made on the [[BBC]] programme [[Crimewatch]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In May 2007 the inquest heard that the investigation found no evidence of trauma, assault or drowning and it recorded an open verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/north_yorkshire/7000439.stm|title=Woman's identity still a mystery|last=Staff|first=|date=18 September 2007|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the police announced that they were reopening the investigation of eight unsolved deaths. The 'Lady of the Hills' was one of these cases along with the [[Sutton Bank body|Sutton Bank Body.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9371400.Police_reopen_inquiries_into_eight_unsolved_deaths/|title=Police reopen inquiries into eight unsolved deaths|last=Henderson|first=Vicki|date=18 November 2011|website=The Northern Echo|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 an appeal was made by the North Yorkshire Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/woman-found-dead-on-pennine-way-14-years-ago-still-unidentified-cold-case-review-team-launch-facebook-appeal-1-9248970|title=Woman found dead  on Pennine Way 14 years ago still unidentified:  Cold case review team launch Facebook appeal|last=Lavery|first=Mark|date=12 July 2018|work=The Yorkshire Post|access-date=2018-07-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was made on [[Facebook]] in the [[Filipino language|Filipino]], [[Thai language|Thai]], and [[English language|English]] languages so that the messages could be shared internationally.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-44812523|title=Facebook appeal over body found in Dales|last=Staff|first=|date=13 July 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lee Powell'''  (born '''Lee Berrian Powell'''; May 15, 1908 [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[California]] &amp;ndash; July 30, 1944 [[Tinian]]) was a film actor known for leading or other major roles in several serials and b-westerns. He was the first actor to portray [[The Lone Ranger]] on Film.  During [[World War II]] he enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] and participated in combat on several Pacific Islands, on one of which he died.&lt;ref name=bwesterns&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b-westerns.com/trio6a.htm|title=Lee Powell|publisher=b-westerns.com|accessdate=2008-09-06}}, citing ''STARS IN THE CORPS - Movie Actors in the United States Marines'' by James E. Wise, Jr., and Anne Collier Rehill ({{ISBN|1557509492}}, Naval Institute Press, 1999), pages 164-165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film career==
Powell attended the [[University of Montana]] with dramatics, football, and track as his main interests.  After various stock work he tried his luck in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making his first appearance uncredited in ''[[Under Two Flags (1936 film)|Under Two Flags]]'' (1936), Powell gained fame for playing the suspect who turned out to be ''[[The Lone Ranger#Film serials|The Lone Ranger]]'' and one of ''[[The Fighting Devil Dogs]]'' in 1938 serials.  He was the first actor to portray the Lone Ranger on film. In addition to making films for [[Republic Pictures]], Powell also appeared in [[Universal Pictures]] ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]'' serial, made one Western for the soon-to-be-defunct [[Grand National Pictures]] and made the six Western programmer films of the ''Frontier Marshals'' series, in which each of the three leads (the others being [[William Lemuel Boyd|Bill "Cowboy Rambler" Boyd]] and [[Art Davis (actor)|Art Davis]]) played a lawman bearing his own name, for [[Producers Releasing Corporation]]. Between films Powell also appeared in Barnett Brothers [[circus]] being billed as ''The Lone Ranger'' until litigation had him change his billing.  Powell met and married Norma Rogers, a circus bareback rider and the daughter of the circus owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~scyork/LouisePettus/elephant.htm Elephants &amp; The Lone Ranger In York&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marine Corps career==
Powell enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on 17 August 1942, serving in the [[2nd Combat Engineer Battalion|2nd Pioneer Battalion]], [[2nd Combat Engineer Battalion|18th Marine Regiment]] of the [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]].  Achieving the rank of [[Sergeant#Marine Corps|Sergeant]], Powell actively fought in the [[Battle of Tarawa]] and [[Battle of Saipan]].  

Although he was widely reported to have been killed in action, one source claims he died of poisoning on [[Tinian]], while celebrating the combat victory at that site, as the result of drinking an alcohol concoction that also temporarily blinded another Marine.&lt;ref name=bwesterns/&gt;  Another source, Fred Goerner, a CBS correspondent, while conducting research for his later best seller "The Search for Amelia Earhart,"&lt;ref&gt;Personal Notes of Fred Goerner, Goerner Collection, National Museum of the Pacific War, Fredericksburg, TX&lt;/ref&gt; (1966) had a discussion with a former Marine who participated in the Battles of Saipan and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. (June/July 1944) That Marine told Goerner that Lee Powell died after drinking poisoned sake.

Initially buried on Tinian, Powell's remains were transferred to the [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]] in [[Honolulu]].

[[File:Incidental lithopedian upon TAH 50 year.jpg|thumb|A [[CT scan]] showing an extra-uterine calcified foetal skeleton, a lithopedion]]

A '''lithopedion''' – [[American and British English differences|also spelled]] '''lithopaedion''' or '''lithopædion''' – ({{lang-grc|λίθος}} = [[rock (geology)|stone]]; {{lang-grc|παιδίον}} = small child, infant), or '''stone baby''', is a rare phenomenon which occurs most commonly when a [[fetus]] dies during an [[abdominal pregnancy]],&lt;ref name="Perper, 2006"&gt;Perper, J.A. (2006): Chapter III: Time of Death and Changes after Death. Part 1: Anatomical Considerations. In: Spitz, W.U. &amp; Spitz, D.J. (eds): ''Spitz and Fisher’s Medicolegal Investigation of Death. Guideline for the Application of Pathology to Crime Investigations (Fourth edition)'', Charles C. Thomas, pp.: 87-127; Springfield, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt; is too large to be reabsorbed by the body, and [[Calcification|calcifies]] on the outside as part of a [[foreign body reaction]], shielding the mother's body from the dead tissue of the fetus and preventing [[infection]].

Lithopedia may occur from 14 weeks gestation to full term. It is not unusual for a stone baby to remain undiagnosed for decades and to be found well after natural [[menopause]]; diagnosis often happens when the patient is examined for other conditions that require being subjected to a [[X-ray]] study. A review of 128 cases by T.S.P. Tien found that the mean age of women with lithopedia was fifty-five years at the time of diagnosis, with the oldest being one-hundred years old. The lithopedia was carried for an average of twenty-two years, and in several cases, the women became pregnant a second time and gave birth to children without incident. Nine of the reviewed cases had carried lithopedia for over fifty years before diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Bondenson, Jan 2000"&gt;Bondenson, Jan (2000) ''The Two-headed Boy, and Other Medical Marvels.''

==History==
The earliest known lithopedion was found in an archaeological excavation at Bering Sinkhole, on the [[Edwards Plateau]] in [[Kerr County, Texas]], and dated to 1100 BC.&lt;ref name="Rothschild et al. 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rothschild BM, Rothschild C, Bement LC |title=Three-millennium antiquity of the lithokelyphos variety of lithopedion |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=169 |issue=1 |pages=140–1 |date=July 1993 |pmid=8333440 |doi=10.1016/0002-9378(93)90148-c|last2=Rothschild |last3=Bement }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example was found in a [[Gallo-Roman]] archaeological site in [[Costebelle]], southern [[France]], dating to the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamesedwardhughes.com/4/post/2013/07/wednesday-wonders-3-the-lithopedion.html Wednesday Wonders #3: The Lithopedion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123030040/http://www.jamesedwardhughes.com/4/post/2013/07/wednesday-wonders-3-the-lithopedion.html |date=23 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The condition was first described in a treatise by the [[Al Andalus|Spanish Muslim]] physician Abū al-Qāsim ([[Abulcasis]]) in the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Rothschild et al. 1993"/&gt; By the mid-18th century, a number of cases had been documented in humans, [[sheep]] and [[European hare|hare]]s in [[France]] and [[Germany]]. In a speech before the French [[Académie Royal des Sciences|Académie Royale des Sciences]] in 1748, surgeon [[Sauveur François Morand]] used lithopedia both as evidence of the [[comparative anatomy|common nature]] of [[fetal development]] in [[viviparous]] and [[oviparous]] animals, and as an argument in favor of [[cesarean section]].&lt;ref name="Stofft"&gt;Stofft, Henri. Un lithopédion en 1678. [One case of Lithopaedion in 1678.] (1986) ''Histoire des sciences médicales'', 20 (3), pp. 267-286 URL: http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/sfhm/hsm/HSMx1986x020x003/HSMx1986x020x003x0267.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, [[German Empire|German]] physician [[Friedrich Küchenmeister]] reviewed 47 cases of lithopedia from the medical literature and distinguished three subgroups: ''Lithokelyphos'' ("Stone Sheath"), where calcification occurs on the placental membrane and not the fetus; ''Lithotecnon'' ("Stone Child") or "true" lithopedion, where the fetus itself is calcified after entering the [[abdominal cavity]], following the rupture of the placental and ovarian membranes; and ''Lithokelyphopedion'' ("Stone Sheath [and] Child"), where both fetus and sac are calcified. Lithopedia can originate both as [[tubal pregnancy|tubal]] and [[ovarian pregnancy|ovarian pregnancies]], although tubal pregnancy cases are more common.&lt;ref name="Bondenson, Jan 2000"/&gt;

|The case referred by Abulcasis. The patient was pregnant in two separate occasions but never gave birth. "A long time" after, she developed a large swelling in the navel area, that turned into a suppurating wound and would not heal despite receiving treatment. This continued until Abulcasis removed several fetal bones through the wound, which initially shocked Abulcasis, as he had never known of a similar case. The patient largely recovered her health, but she continued to suppurate through the wound.&lt;ref name="Schumann, Edward A. 1924"&gt;Schumann, Edward A. (1924) ''Extra-uterine pregnancy.'' D.

|Originally from the [[Gascony|Gascon]] village of Viulas near [[Lombez]], Mathieu gave birth to ten children but only three survived infancy. At 37, she became pregnant, carried to full term and broke her water for the eleventh time, but she never gave birth despite the efforts of a physician. She suffered from acute abdominal pain for two months and vaginal bleeding for five, and felt discomfort for the rest of her life. She could only ease this when she lied over her back, which made her bedridden in practice, and experience periodic [[paroxysmal attack]]s. Her case became notorious and her symptoms were popularly attributed to a spell cast by a sorceress whom Mathieu had rejected as a [[midwife]]. She consented to be the subject of a public, three-day long [[necropsy]] after her death, which was attended by four doctors, three surgeons and their assistants. They found the calcified [[umbilical cord]], [[placenta]] and a fully formed baby boy inside that weighted 3,916 [[gram]]s. The lithopedion was found floating in white, odorless [[pus]], which made it semi-mobile and would explain Mathieu's claim that she could still feel the baby moving inside her. The lithopedion was extensively described and pictured in a published memoir by François Boyle, one of the doctors present.&lt;ref name="Stofft"/&gt;

Convinced that she had been pregnant and carried the previous baby with her still, Mullern made the local physician and surgeon swear that they would open her body after her death. The physician did not survive her, but the elderly surgeon fulfilled his promise with the help of his son, finding "a hard mass of the form and size of a large Ninepin-Bowl" that contained a petrified fetus inside. It was examined by [[George I of Britain]]'s personal physician [[Johann Georg Steigerthal]], who wrote an account of it.&lt;ref&gt;Bondenson, Jan (2000) ''The Two-headed Boy, and Other Medical Marvels.''

At 61, she was hospitalized for chest inflammation and died shortly after. The autopsy found an oval mass the size of a man's head embedded in her right [[fallopian tube]], which weighted eight [[pound (mass)|pounds]] and contained a fully formed baby boy with hair, two incisors and remains of [[amniotic fluid]].

'''Lucio Magri''' (19 August 1932 &amp;ndash; 28 November 2011) was an Italian journalist and politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Redazione Online |url=http://www.corriere.it/cronache/11_novembre_29/magri-suicidio-assistito_a6f690f8-1a59-11e1-a0da-00d265bd2fc6.shtml |title=Suicidio assistito per Lucio Magri - Corriere della Sera |publisher=Corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Magri was born in [[Ferrara]] in [[Emilia-Romagna]], one of the most left-wing regions of Italy, but grew up in the strongly [[Catholic Church in Italy|Catholic]] [[Bergamo]], [[Lombardy]]. His first involvement in politics was as a member of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]], taking up positions firmly on the left wing of the party. However in 1958 he was one of a number of Catholic intellectuals who joined the Communist Party. In 1969, he was one of the founders of the far-left newspaper ''[[il manifesto]]'', co-editing it with [[Rossana Rossanda]]. The newspaper's work was controversial with the Communist Party's leadership, and by the end of the year Magri had been expelled from the Party.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/dec/07/lucio-magri |title=Lucio Magri obituary |last=Sassoon |first=Donald |date=7 December 2011 |website=[[theguardian.com]] |access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was co-founder (in 1974) and secretary of the [[Proletarian Unity Party (Italy)|Proletarian Unity Party for Communism]] (or PdUP), which later merged with the [[Italian Communist Party]] in 1984. When the latter renounced communism to become the [[Democratic Party of the Left]] in 1991, Magri adhered to the [[Communist Refoundation Party]], founding an internal movement whose structure recalled that of PdUP.

In 1995 his movement split, to form the [[Movement of Unitarian Communists]], established to support a centrist cabinet led by [[Lamberto Dini]]. When the Movement entered the newly formed [[Democratic Party of the Left]], Magri abandoned it, devoting himself only to ''il manifesto''.

In 2009 he published an essay on the history of the Italian Communist Party, entitled ''Il sarto di Ulm. Una possibile storia del PCI'' (The Tailor of Ulm. A possible history of the P.C.I.).  In 2011, Verso Books published 'The Tailor of Ulm: Communism in the Twentieth Century'.  Reviewing the book in Review 31, John Green praised it as 'an invaluable platform for understanding the apparent impasse of the present global and systemic crisis'.

In his later years, Magri suffered from depression, exacerbated by the death of his wife Mara in 2008. He chose to take up [[assisted suicide]], passing away in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]]. He was survived by a daughter, Jessica, and a granddaughter, Emma.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

'''Mary Hardy Reeser''' (1884 – July 2, 1951) of [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Florida]] was a suspected victim of [[spontaneous human combustion]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Blizin [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sARZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lE8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3822,1539798&amp;dq=mary+reeser&amp;hl=en "No New Clues In Reeser Death; Debris Sent To Lab"], ''St. Petersburg Times'', July 5, 1951, p14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
On July 2, 1951, at about 8&amp;nbsp;a.m., Reeser's landlady, Pansy Carpenter, arrived at Reeser's door with a telegram.  Trying the door, she found the metal doorknob to be uncomfortably warm to the touch and called the police.

Reeser's remains, which were largely ashes, were found among the remains of a chair in which she had been sitting. Only part of her left foot (which was wearing a slipper) and her backbone remained, along with her skull. Plastic household objects at a distance from the seat of the fire were softened and had lost their shapes.

Reeser's skull had survived and was found among the ashes, but shrunken (sometimes with the added descriptive flourish of 'to the size of a teacup'). The extent of this shrinkage was enough to be remarked on by official investigators and was not an [[illusion]] caused by the removal of all facial features (ears, nose, lips, etc.). The shrinking of the skull is not a regular feature of alleged cases of [[spontaneous human combustion|SHC]], although the 'shrunken skull' claim has become a regular feature of [[anecdote|anecdotal]] accounts of other SHC cases and numerous [[apocryphal]] stories.  However, this is not the only case in which [[George I. Mott|the remains featured a shrunken skull]].

On July 7, 1951, St. Petersburg police chief J.R. Reichert sent a box of evidence from the scene to [[FBI]] Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. He included glass fragments found in the ashes, six "small objects thought to be teeth," a section of the carpet, and the surviving shoe.

Even though the body was almost totally [[cremated]], requiring very high temperatures, the room in which it occurred showed little evidence of the fire.

Reichert included a note saying: "We request any information or theories that could explain how a human body could be so destroyed and the fire confined to such a small area and so little damage done to the structure of the building and the furniture in the room not even scorched or damaged by smoke."

The [[FBI]] eventually declared that Reeser had been incinerated by the [[wick effect]]. As she was a known user of sleeping pills, they hypothesized that she had fallen unconscious while smoking and set fire to her nightclothes. "Once the body starts to burn," the FBI wrote in its report, "there is enough fat and other inflammable substances to permit varying amounts of destruction to take place. Sometimes this destruction by burning will proceed to a degree which results in almost complete combustion of the body."

At the request of the Chief of Police, St. Petersburg, Florida, the scene was also investigated by [[physical anthropology|physical anthropologist]] [[Wilton M Krogman]]. Professor Krogman, of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Medical school|School of Medicine]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}, had spent some time in the 1930s experimenting and examining the remains of such incidents, in order to aid in the detection of crimes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Krogman was frequently consulted by the [[FBI]] for this reason but  after examining the scene and reading the FBI's report, he strongly disputed the FBI's conclusions concerning Reeser. However, the full circumstances of the death—and Krogman's objections to the FBI's version of events—would not become known publicly for a decade.

==Quotations==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
In a 1961 article for ''The General Magazine and History Chronicle of the University of Pennsylvania'', Krogman wrote extensively about the Reeser case. His remarks included:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I find it hard to believe that a human body, once ignited, will literally consume itself -- burn itself out, as does a candle wick, guttering in the last residual pool of melted wax [...] Just what did happen on the night of July 1, 1951, in St. Petersburg, Florida? We may never know, though this case still haunts me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With regard to Reeser's shrunken skull, Krogman wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...]The head is not left complete in ordinary burning cases. Certainly it does not shrivel or symmetrically reduce to a smaller size. In presence of heat sufficient to destroy soft tissues, the skull would literally explode in many pieces. I have never known any exception to this rule.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Krogman concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I cannot conceive of such complete cremation without more burning of the apartment itself. In fact the apartment and everything in it should have been consumed. [...] I regard it as the most amazing thing I have ever seen. As I review it, the short hairs on my neck bristle with vague fear. Were I living in the Middle Ages, I'd mutter something about black magic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, having put this statement on the record, Krogman moved away from this position. He instead put forward the theory that Reeser had been murdered at another location. Her murderer had access to crematorium-type equipment and had incinerated her body. The hypothetical murderer had then transported the results of the partial cremation back to the apartment and used portable heat-generating equipment to add the finishing touches, such as the heat-buckled plastic objects and the warm doorknob.

==Biographical details==

Mary Reeser was born in [[Columbia, Pennsylvania|Columbia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and married Dr. Richard Reeser (b 1874/5). Their only surviving child, also Dr. Richard Reeser, was born in Pennsylvania in 1910 or 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.ancestry.com/Browse/view.aspx?dbid=6224&amp;path=Pennsylvania.Lancaster.Columbia.13.1&amp;fn=Mary&amp;ln=Reeser&amp;st=r&amp;pid=52211338&amp;rc=&amp;zp=75 1930 US Census of Columbia, Lancaster County] showing "Richard Reeser age 55 b PA Physician, Mary wife age 45 b PA, Richard J son age 19 b PA"&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried in the Chestnut Hill Cemetery outside [[Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania|Mechanicsburg]], Pennsylvania.

'''Michael Frost''' (born 1961) is an Australian [[missiologist]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/november/33.66.html?start=2 "Stopping Cultural Drift"], ''Christianity Today'', 16 November 2006, p. 2, accessed 22 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the leading voices in the [[missional|missional church movement]]. Frost is the founding Director of the Tinsley Institute, a mission study centre located at [[Morling College]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morlingcollege.com/faculty/rev-dr-michael-frost/|title=Rev. Dr Michael Frost|work=Morling College|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a senior lecturer with the Melbourne University of Divinity.

Frost is the author or editor of a number of theological books, the most recent of which are ''The Shaping of Things to Come'' (2003), ''Exiles'' (2006), ''The Road to Missional'' (2011) and ''Surprise the World'' (2016). These books explore a missional framework for the church in a post-Christendom era. Frost's work has been translated into German, Korean and Spanish. Frost has spoken at conferences in the United States, the United Kingdom and across Europe, and as far afield as Nairobi, Rio de Janeiro and Moscow.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1999, Frost and Alan Hirsch founded the Forge Mission Training Network, an action-reflection based program for training missional leaders.

In [[medicine]], '''obligatory synergies''' occur when [[spasticity]] appears, such as following a [[stroke]]. It manifests in abnormal and stereotypical patterns across multiple joints called obligatory synergies.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan"&gt;
O'Sullivan, S.B. (2007). Stroke: Motor Function. In S. B. O’Sullivan, &amp; T. J. Schmitz (Eds.), Physical Rehabilitation (pp. 720). Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company&lt;/ref&gt; They are described as either a [[flexion]] [[synergy]] or an extension synergy and affect both the upper and lower extremity (see below).&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan" /&gt; When these patterns occur in a patient, he or she is unable to move a limb segment in isolation of the pattern.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan" /&gt;  This interferes with normal activities of daily living.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan" /&gt;  Some aspects of the obligatory synergy patterns however, can be cleverly used to increase function relative to the movement available to the individual. Careful thought should, therefore, be considered in deciding which muscle groups to stretch at specific times during recovery. Obligatory synergy patterns are observed when a patient tries to make a minimal voluntary movement, or as a result of stimulated reflexes.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan" /&gt;

The flexion synergy for the upper extremity includes [[scapula]]r [[Retraction (kinesiology)|retraction]] and [[Elevation (kinesiology)|elevation]], shoulder [[Abduction (anatomy)|abduction]] and external rotation, elbow flexion, forearm [[supination]], and wrist and finger flexion.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan" /&gt;

The extension synergy for the upper extremity includes scapular [[protraction]], shoulder [[adduction]] and internal rotation, elbow extension, forearm [[pronation]], and wrist and finger flexion.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan" /&gt;

The flexion synergy for the lower extremity includes hip flexion, abduction and external rotation, knee flexion, ankle [[dorsiflexion]] and [[Inversion (kinesiology)|inversion]] and toe dorsiflexion.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan" /&gt;

The extension synergy for the lower extremity includes hip extension, adduction and internal rotation, knee extension, ankle [[plantar]] flexion and inversion, and toe plantar flexion.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan" /&gt;

Note that some muscles are not usually involved in these synergy patterns and include the [[lattisimus dorsi]], [[teres major]], [[serratus anterior]], finger extensors, and ankle evertors.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan" /&gt;

'''''Prometheus''''' ({{IPAc-en|p|r|ə|ˈ|m|iː|θ|i|ə|s}} {{Respell|prə|MEE|thee-əs}}) is a 2012 [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Ridley Scott]], written by [[Jon Spaihts]] and [[Damon Lindelof]] and starring [[Noomi Rapace]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Guy Pearce]], [[Idris Elba]], [[Logan Marshall-Green]], and [[Charlize Theron]]. It is set in the late 21st century and centers on the crew of the spaceship ''Prometheus'' as it follows a [[star map]] discovered among the artifacts of several ancient Earth cultures. Seeking the origins of humanity, the crew arrives on a distant world and discovers a threat that could cause the extinction of the human species.

Development of the film began in the early 2000s as a fifth installment in the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]]. Scott and director [[James Cameron]] developed ideas for a film that would serve as a [[prequel]] to Scott's 1979 science-fiction horror film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''. In 2002, the development of ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' took precedence, and the project remained dormant until 2009 when Scott again showed interest. Spaihts wrote a script for a prequel to the events of the ''Alien'' films, but Scott opted for a different direction to avoid repeating cues from those films. In late 2010, Lindelof joined the project to rewrite Spaihts's script, and he and Scott developed a story that precedes the story of ''Alien'' but is not directly connected to that franchise. According to Scott, although the film shares "strands of ''Alien''{{'}}s DNA, so to speak", and takes place in the same [[fictional universe|universe]], ''Prometheus'' explores its own mythology and ideas.

''Prometheus'' entered production in April 2010, with extensive design phases during which the technology and creatures that the film required were developed. [[Principal photography]] began in March 2011, with an estimated $120–130&amp;nbsp;million budget. The project was shot using [[3D film|3D]] cameras throughout, almost entirely on practical sets, and on location in England, Iceland, Spain, and Scotland. It was promoted with a marketing campaign that included viral activities on the web. Three videos featuring the film's leading actors in character, which expanded on elements of the fictional universe, were released and met with a generally positive reception and awards.

''Prometheus'' was released on June 1, 2012, in the United Kingdom and on June 8, 2012, in [[North America]]. The film received praise for the aesthetic design and the acting, especially Fassbender's performance as the android David, while plot elements that remained unresolved or predictable were the main source of criticism. The film grossed over $403 million worldwide.  A sequel, ''[[Alien: Covenant]]'', was released in May 2017.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE-LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS! --&gt;
As a spacecraft departs a planet, a [[humanoid]] alien drinks an [[iridescent]] liquid, causing its body to dissolve. As its remains cascade into a waterfall, the alien's DNA falls apart and recombines.

In 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a [[star chart|star map]] in Scotland that matches others from several unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanity's forerunners, the "Engineers." Peter Weyland, the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, funds an expedition, aboard the scientific vessel ''Prometheus,'' to follow the map to the distant moon LV-223. The ship's crew travels in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]] while the [[android (robot)|android]] David monitors their voyage. Arriving in December 2093, mission-director Meredith Vickers informs them of their mission to find the Engineers and not to make contact without her permission.

The ''Prometheus'' lands on the barren, mountainous surface near a large, artificial structure, which a team explores. Inside, they find stone cylinders, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a large alien, thought to be an Engineer; Shaw recovers its head. The crew finds other bodies, leading them to surmise the species is extinct. Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt to return to ''Prometheus'', but become stranded in the structure when they get lost. The expedition is cut short when a storm forces the crew to return to the ship. David secretly takes a cylinder from the structure, while the remaining cylinders begin leaking a dark liquid. In the ship's lab, the Engineer's DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the cylinder and the liquid inside. He intentionally taints a drink with the liquid and gives it to the unsuspecting Holloway, who had stated he would do anything for answers. Shortly after, Shaw and Holloway have sex.

Inside the structure, a snake-like creature kills Millburn and sprays a corrosive fluid that melts Fifield's helmet. Fifield falls face-first into a puddle of dark liquid. When the crew returns, they find Millburn's corpse. David separately discovers a control room containing a surviving Engineer in stasis, and a large 3D holographic star map highlighting Earth. Meanwhile, Holloway sickens rapidly. He is rushed back to ''Prometheus'', but Vickers refuses to let him aboard, and at his urging, burns him to death with a flamethrower. Later, a medical scan reveals that Shaw, despite being [[sterility (physiology)|sterile]], is pregnant. Fearing the worst, she uses an automated surgery table to extract a squid-like creature from her abdomen. Shaw then discovers that Weyland has been in stasis aboard ''Prometheus.'' He explains that he wants to ask the Engineers how to prevent his death from old age. As Weyland prepares to leave for the structure, Vickers addresses him as "Father".

A monstrous, mutated Fifield returns to the ''Prometheus'' and kills several crew members before he is killed. The ''Prometheus''{{'}} captain, Janek, speculates that the structure was an Engineer military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. He also determines that the structure houses a spacecraft. Weyland and a team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him in an attempt to explain what Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the liquid on Earth, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the ''Prometheus'' into the alien craft, ejecting the lifeboat in the process, while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground, killing Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. David's still-active head warns Shaw that the Engineer is pursuing her. The Engineer forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer; it thrusts an [[ovipositor]] down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains, and with his help, launches another Engineer spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers' homeworld in an attempt to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity.

In the lifeboat, an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Deacon|alien creature]] bursts out of the Engineer's chest.

*[[Noomi Rapace]] as Elizabeth Shaw:
:Rapace described Shaw, an archaeologist, as a believer in God with a very strong faith, and said that, "In the middle of the movie, things happen and she changes into more of a warrior. And in the end, she's such a survivor."&lt;ref name="colliderrapaceinterview"/&gt; To aid her [[method acting]], she developed a complete backstory for Shaw,&lt;ref name="CastRapace6"/&gt; and worked with a dialect coach to achieve a British accent.{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=64}} She also asked her make-up artist to apply extra blood and sweat during filming to more accurately portray her character.&lt;ref name="CastRapace10"/&gt; Rapace said, "I was out there filming for about six months and it was super-intense, my body was in so much pain sometimes but it was absolutely amazing."&lt;ref name="Filming9"/&gt; She dismissed comparisons to the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]]'s [[Ellen Ripley]].&lt;ref name="CastRapace5"/&gt; Rapace came to director Ridley Scott's attention for her performance as [[Lisbeth Salander]] in the 2009 drama film ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009 film)|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]''. She met Scott in August 2010,&lt;ref name="CastRapace1"/&gt; and by January 2011 she had secured the role.&lt;ref name="Cast1"/&gt; Actresses [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Gemma Arterton]], [[Carey Mulligan]], and [[Abbie Cornish]] were all considered for the role during development.&lt;ref name="CastRapace2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastRapace3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastRapace4"/&gt; [[Lucy Hutchinson (actress)|Lucy Hutchinson]], who was eight years old in 2012, portrays Shaw as a child.&lt;ref name="Lucy"/&gt;
*[[Michael Fassbender]] as [[David 8|David]]:
: David is an [[android (robot)|android]] that acts as the ship's butler and maintenance man. It is designed to be indistinguishable from humans, and begins to develop "its own ego, insecurities, jealousy and envy".&lt;ref name="paradise found"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MiscWonderCon12"/&gt; Writer [[Damon Lindelof]] stated that the character provides a non-human perspective on the film's events, and said, "what does the movie look like from the robot's point of view? If you were to ask him, 'What do you think about all of this? What's going on? What do you think about these humans who are around you?' Wouldn't it be cool if we found a way for that robot to answer those questions?"&lt;ref name="CastFass2"/&gt; Fassbender said, "David's views on the human crew are somewhat childlike. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing, and therefore he is superior to the humans. David wants to be acknowledged and praised for his brilliance".&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt; In developing his character, Fassbender avoided watching the android characters of ''Alien'' (1979) and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986), and instead studied the [[replicant]]s in Scott's 1982 science fiction film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', with a focus on [[Sean Young]]'s character Rachael, whose "vacancy" and longing for a soul interested him.&lt;ref name="CastFass5"/&gt; Fassbender drew further inspiration from the voice of the [[HAL 9000]] computer in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'',&lt;ref name="CastFass5"/&gt; the "funny walk and economy of movement" of Olympic diver [[Greg Louganis]],&lt;ref name="Sequel2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastFass4"/&gt; and the performances of [[David Bowie]] in ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', [[Dirk Bogarde]] in ''[[The Servant (1963 film)|The Servant]]'', and [[Peter O'Toole]] in ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''.&lt;ref name="Marketing40"/&gt; David's blond hair was modeled on that of [[T. E. Lawrence]].{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=72}} Scott favored Fassbender for the role; by January 2011 he was confirmed to have joined the cast,&lt;ref name="CastFass1"/&gt; despite earlier reports that his agents had sought too high a fee.&lt;ref name="paradise found"/&gt;
*[[Charlize Theron]] as Meredith Vickers:
:Vickers is a Weyland Corporation employee who is sent to monitor the expedition.&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt;{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=67}} Theron described the character as "a suit who slowly sheds [her] skin through the film",&lt;ref name="CastTheron2"/&gt; and also as "somewhat of a villain&amp;nbsp;... [who] definitely has an agenda".&lt;ref name="CastTheron3"/&gt; She stated "Vickers is pragmatic, and desperately wants to control the situation."&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt; Scott wanted the character to lurk in the background of scenes watching other characters instead of being the focus. Theron said that this helped layer her character because "you're just so suspicious of her, instantly."{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=84}} The similarities between the appearances and mannerisms of Vickers and David were intended to raise the possibility that David was based on Vickers's DNA, or that Vickers is an android herself.&lt;ref name="CastTheron6"/&gt; After Theron was cast in the role, she developed three new scenes with Scott and Lindelof to expand her character.&lt;ref name="THRMay1612"/&gt; Physical action scenes, some of which involved her running through sand in {{convert|30|lb|kg|adj=on}} boots were a problem for Theron.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=84}} It was intended that Theron would portray Shaw, but a prior commitment to ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'' prevented her involvement. When that film was delayed, she was able to rejoin ''Prometheus''.{{Sfn|Nashawaty|2012|pp=7–8}} [[Michelle Yeoh]] and [[Angelina Jolie]]&lt;ref name="Cast1"/&gt; were considered for the role.&lt;ref name="paradise found"/&gt;
*[[Idris Elba]] as Janek:
:Janek is the captain of the ''Prometheus''.&lt;ref name="CastElba1"/&gt; Elba described the character as "a longshoreman and a sailor", with a military background.&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt;{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=66}} He said, "[being the captain is] his life and the crew is his responsibility,"&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt; and "he's a realistic, pragmatic character. He has to get involved&amp;nbsp;... in a film with huge ideas, you need a character like this, who can go 'Wait&amp;nbsp;... why are we doing this?{{' "}}.{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=66}}
*[[Guy Pearce]] as Peter Weyland:
:Weyland is the billionaire founder and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Weyland Corp.&lt;ref name="MarketingTED"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastPearce4"/&gt; Lindelof described him as having a massive ego and suffering from a [[god complex]].&lt;ref name="MarketingTED"/&gt; Applying the necessary prosthetics and make-up to transform Pearce into the aging Weyland took five hours, and an hour to remove it. Pearce observed elderly individuals to gain insight into the movement for his character, as he found replicating the impeded physical movement the most difficult part of the role.&lt;ref name="CastPearce5"/&gt; [[Max von Sydow]] was Scott's original choice to play Weyland, but the casting of Pearce made it possible for him to portray Weyland as both an elderly character, and a younger man who appeared in an earlier script draft.&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt;
*[[Logan Marshall-Green]] as Charlie Holloway:
:Holloway is an archaeologist and Shaw's love interest.&lt;ref name="CastGreen2"/&gt;{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=69}} Marshall-Green was cast after he was seen performing on stage "[[Off-Off-Broadway|off-off-''off'' Broadway]]".{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=69}} He described Holloway as the "[[X Games]]-type scientist", and said that he liked the character's "leap-before-looking" philosophy. He also said that Holloway "doesn't want to meet his maker. He wants to stand next to his maker. He's willing to go to the edge to get that."{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=69}} Describing the character's motivation, he said: "he goes to the extreme in everything he does, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse of the [''Prometheus crew'']. I think what drives him is the thrill of the search."&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt; Marshall-Green contrasted Holloway with Shaw, and said: "she's the believer. I'm the scientist. I'm the skeptic. I'm the atheist".&lt;ref name="CastGreen3"/&gt;

*[[Sean Harris]] as Fifield:
:Fifield is a geologist who has become mentally unstable after many missions.&lt;ref name="CastHarris1"/&gt;{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=65}} Harris described the character as "someone who can sense when things are up. He's your audience guy, going, 'Don't go in that tunnel. We should not be doing this!{{' "}}{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=65}} Fifield's bright red [[mohawk hairstyle]] was designed by Harris and Scott, based on Scott's sketch of a man with a "severe haircut".{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=65}}

*[[Rafe Spall]] as Millburn:
:Millburn is a [[biology|biologist]]. Spall auditioned for another role, but Scott wanted him to play Millburn.&lt;ref name="CastTheron5"/&gt;{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=70}} On his casting, Spall said "''Alien'' is one of the best films ever made, and it's a real buzz to be in a space suit on an ''Alien'' set with Ridley Scott coming and speaking to you. It's incredible. That's why I wanted to be an actor, to be in a space suit on an ''Alien'' set".&lt;ref name="pre2"/&gt;

Other cast members include [[Kate Dickie]] as the ship's medic, Ford;{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=70}} [[Emun Elliott]] and [[Benedict Wong]] as, respectively, ship pilots Chance and Ravel;&lt;ref name="CastElliot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CastElliot2"/&gt; and [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Shaw's father.&lt;ref name="CastWilson1"/&gt; [[Ian Whyte (actor)|Ian Whyte]] and Daniel James portray Engineers.&lt;ref name="CastEngineer"/&gt;

==Themes==
The central theme in ''Prometheus'' concerns the [[Prometheus|eponymous Titan]] of [[Greek mythology]] who defies the gods and gifts humanity with fire, for which he is subjected to eternal punishment.&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt; The gods want to limit their creations in case they attempt to usurp the gods.&lt;ref name="Theme5"/&gt; The film deals with humanity's relationship with the gods—their creators—and the consequence of defying them. A human expedition intends to find God and receive knowledge about belief, immortality and death. They find superior beings who appear god-like in comparison to humanity, and the ''Prometheus'' crew suffer consequences for their pursuit.&lt;ref name="Cast30"/&gt; Shaw is directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants her religious beliefs affirmed,&lt;ref name="Writing23"/&gt; and believes she is entitled to answers from God; her questions remain unanswered and she is punished for her [[hubris]].&lt;ref name="Theme1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Theme2"/&gt; The film offers similar resolution, providing items of information but leaving the connections and conclusions to the audience, potentially leaving the question unanswered.&lt;ref name="Theme2"/&gt; Further religious allusions are implied by the Engineers' decision to punish humanity with destruction 2,000 years before the events of the film. Scott suggested that an Engineer was sent to Earth to stop humanity's increasing aggression, but was crucified, implying it was Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name="Theme1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Theme6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Theme8"/&gt; However, Scott felt that an explicit connection in the film would be "a little too on the nose."&lt;ref name="Theme1"/&gt;

[[Artificial intelligence]], a unifying theme throughout Scott's career as a director, is particularly evident in ''Prometheus'', primarily through the android David.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Adam Barkman, Ashley Barkman and Nancy Kang, eds. | title = The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott | pages= 121–142 | publisher=Lexington Books | year= 2013 | isbn = 978-0-7391-7872-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; David is like humans but does not want to be like them, eschewing a common theme in "robotic storytelling" such as ''Blade Runner''. David is created in the image of humanity, and while the human crew of the ''Prometheus'' ship searches for their creators expecting answers, David exists among his human creators yet is underwhelmed; he questions his creators about why they are seeking their own.&lt;ref name="Theme2"/&gt;{{Sfn|McCabe|Farley|Edwards|2012|p=60}} Lindelof described the ship as a prison for David.&lt;ref name="Theme2"/&gt; At the conclusion of the film, David's creator (Weyland) is dead and his fundamental programming will end without someone to serve. Lindelof explained that David's programming becomes unclear and that he could be programmed by Shaw or his own sense of curiosity. Following Weyland's death, David is left with Shaw, and is sincere and interested in following her, partly out of survival and partly out of curiosity.&lt;ref name="Theme3"/&gt;

Another theme is creation and the question of "Who Am I? Who Made Me? Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?"&lt;ref name="Theme6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Theme7"/&gt; Development of the in-universe mythology explored the Judeo-Christian creation of man, but Scott was interested in [[Greco-Roman]] and [[Aztec]] creation myths about gods who create man in their own image by sacrificing a piece of themselves. This creation is shown in the film's opening in which an Engineer sacrifices itself after consuming the dark liquid, acting as a "gardener in space" to bring life to a world.&lt;ref name="Theme8"/&gt; One of their expeditions creates humanity, who create artificial life (David) in their own image. David then introduces the dark liquid to Holloway who impregnates a sterile Shaw, and the resulting child impregnates an Engineer, creating the child of all three generations.&lt;ref name="Theme6"/&gt; Scott likened the Engineers to the dark angels of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', and said that humanity was their offspring and not God's.&lt;ref name="Theme1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Theme9"/&gt;

Shaw is the only religious believer in the crew and openly displays her religious belief with a necklace of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she was created by the Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers.&lt;ref name="Theme6"/&gt; In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that ''Prometheus'' is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and faith in God can co-exist.&lt;ref name="Theme10"/&gt;

Beside drawing several influences from ''Paradise Lost'', ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s [[Govindini Murty]] noted further influences, and wrote that "[t]he striking images Ridley Scott devises for ''Prometheus'' reference everything from [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001]]'' to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' and [[Mario Bava]]'s ''[[Planet of the Vampires]]''. Scott also expands on the original ''Alien'' universe by creating a distinctly English mythology informed by Milton's ''Paradise Lost'' and the symbolic drawings of [[William Blake]]."&lt;ref name="GuideTheAtlantic"/&gt;

==Production==

===Development===
Development on a fifth film in the ''Alien'' franchise was in progress by 2002. Scott considered returning to the series he created with his 1979 science fiction horror film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', to pursue a sequel that would explore the engineered origins of the series's [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien creatures]],&lt;ref name="Development15"/&gt; and the "space jockey"—the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial being]], who briefly appears in ''Alien'', as the deceased pilot of a derelict spaceship.&lt;ref name="Development1"/&gt; ''Alien'' star [[Sigourney Weaver]] also expressed interest in returning to the series.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt; ''Aliens'' director [[James Cameron]] discussed the potential for a sequel with Scott, and began working with another writer on a story for the film. It was then that [[20th Century Fox]] approached Cameron with a script for a crossover film that would pit the series's monsters against the title characters of the ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' films; this project became the 2004 science fiction film ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]''.&lt;ref name="Development14"/&gt; After Fox confirmed that it would pursue the crossover, Cameron stopped working on his own project, believing the crossover would "kill the validity of the franchise."&lt;ref name="vespe"/&gt; In 2006, Cameron confirmed that he would not return to the ''Alien'' sequel project, believing that the series was Fox's asset, and he was unwilling to deal with the studio's attempts to influence the potential sequel.&lt;ref name="Development14"/&gt;

In May 2009, Fox said that the project was a "reboot"&lt;ref name="prometheusblueprint"/&gt; of the ''Alien'' franchise, and soon afterwards was reported as an untitled prequel to ''Alien''.&lt;ref name="Development3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filmophiliascott"/&gt; Development stopped in June 2009 when Fox clashed with Scott over his selection of former [[Television advertisement|television advertisement director]] [[Carl Rinsch|Carl Erik Rinsch]] as director. Fox was only interested in pursuing the project if Scott directed.&lt;ref name="Development5"/&gt; By July 2009, Scott was contracted to direct the film, and screenwriter Jon Spaihts was hired to write the script based on his pitched idea for a direct ''Alien'' prequel.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=84}}&lt;ref name="Development6"/&gt; With the director and writer in place, and pleased with Spaihts's pitch, Fox scheduled a release date for December 2011, but this was eventually canceled.&lt;ref name="Writing1"/&gt; In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and that pre-production would begin, and a filming date was set for January 2011.&lt;ref name="Development13"/&gt; Fox eventually pushed to develop the project into an original work, and by July 2010, Lindelof had been hired to redevelop Spaihts's screenplay.&lt;ref name="Development7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Writing22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HomeMedia10"/&gt; In October 2010, Lindelof submitted his rewritten screenplay to Fox. Scott had initially requested a $250 million budget and an adult oriented project, but Fox was reluctant to invest this amount of money, and wanted to ensure the film would receive a lower age-rating to broaden the potential audience.&lt;ref name="prometheusblueprint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Development8"/&gt;

In December 2010, it was reported that the film would be called ''Paradise'',&lt;ref name="paradise found"/&gt; named after John Milton's poem ''Paradise Lost'', but Scott considered that this would convey too much information about the film. Fox CEO [[Thomas Rothman]] suggested ''Prometheus'', which was confirmed as the title in January 2011.&lt;ref name="Theme1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Development9"/&gt; A release date was scheduled for {{nowrap|March 9, 2012}}, but weeks later the release was postponed until {{nowrap|June 8, 2012}}.&lt;ref name="Development9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Release1"/&gt; With the name confirmed, the production team began to publicly distance the film from its ''Alien'' origins, and were deliberately vague about the connection between the films, believing it would build audience anticipation for ''Prometheus''.&lt;ref name="Writing22"/&gt; Scott stated that "while ''Alien'' was indeed the jumping-off point for this project, out of the creative process evolved a new, grand mythology and universe in which this original story takes place. The keen fan will recognize strands of ''Alien''{{'}}s DNA, so to speak, but the ideas tackled in this film are unique, large and provocative."&lt;ref name="Development10"/&gt; In June 2011, Scott and Lindelof confirmed that ''Prometheus'' takes place in the same universe as the events of the ''Alien'' series.&lt;ref name="CineEurope"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pre"/&gt; In July 2011, Scott stated that "by the end of the third act you start to realize there's a DNA of the very first ''Alien'', but none of the subsequent [films]."&lt;ref name="filmophiliascott" /&gt;

===Writing===
{{quote box|quote="...&amp;nbsp;We're exploring the future&amp;nbsp;... away from Earth and [asking] what are people like now?&amp;nbsp;... Space exploration in the future is going to evolve into this idea that it's not just about going out there and finding planets to build colonies. It also has this inherent idea that the further we go out, the more we learn about ourselves. The characters in this movie are preoccupied with the idea: what are our origins?"|source=—Damon Lindelof, concerning the scope of ''Prometheus''.&lt;ref name="scottbeams"/&gt;|width=35%|align=left}}

Spaihts met Scott in late 2009 and they discussed Scott's desire to pursue an ''Alien'' prequel. Spaihts offered his concept, including a "bridge" that would connect the story of the film's human characters to the ''Alien'' saga. Spaihts was quickly hired, which he credited to the reception of his "bridge" idea. Spaihts claimed he created the concept spontaneously, without preconception. Spaihts wrote a 20-page "extremely detailed outline"; within three and a half weeks he had completed his first draft, and he submitted it to the producers on Christmas Day, 2009. Within 12 hours, Scott returned the script with notes for changes, and Spaihts spent the Christmas holiday redrafting.&lt;ref name="Writing1"/&gt;

Spaihts was tasked with exploring unresolved mysteries from ''Alien'', such as the Space Jockey. He considered the mysteries of ''Alien'' to be alien in nature, and said, "all the mysteries have alien players: the exoskeleton nightmare and&amp;nbsp;... the elephantine titan that was called the 'space jockey'&amp;nbsp;... How do you make anyone care about events between creatures like this?" His solution was to link the alien mysteries to the past and future of humanity. He said: "If that story is somehow ours and deeply enmeshed with the human story, that story changes meaning within our life, things of such significance that we think of our own lives differently."&lt;ref name="Writing2"/&gt; Spaihts found translating Scott's stylistic visual concepts to text difficult, and he periodically constrained some of Scott's ideas. He reminded Scott that in the scene they were discussing, the characters were subject to gravity and so could not simply float.&lt;ref name="Writing1"/&gt; By April 2010, the script was on the fourth draft.&lt;ref name="Development3"/&gt; Scott said about the script, "we are talking about gods and engineers. Engineers of space. And were the aliens designed as a form of biological warfare? Or biology that would go in and clean up a planet?"&lt;ref name="Development7"/&gt; In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and ready for filming.&lt;ref name="Development13"/&gt;

However, Scott instead contacted Lindelof and asked him to review Spaihts's script.{{Sfn|Free|Mottram|Pringle|2012|p=54}} Within the hour, a messenger delivered the script to Lindelof and informed him that he would wait outside to return it as soon as Lindelof had finished reading it.&lt;ref name="Writing20"/&gt; Lindelof was unaware of what Scott and the producers liked about the existing script, and informed them that he found the general concept appealing, but that the story relied too heavily on elements of the ''Alien'' films, such as the ''Alien'' creatures' life-cycle. As a direct prequel to ''Alien'', the story was shaped to lead into that film's story, and to recreate the familiar cues of that series,{{Sfn|Free|Mottram|Pringle|2012|p=54}} and Scott wanted to avoid repeating his previous accomplishments.{{Sfn|McCabe|Farley|Edwards|2012|p=58}} Lindelof said, "If the ending to [''Prometheus''] is just going to be the room that [[John Hurt]] walks into that's full of [alien] eggs [in ''Alien''], there's nothing interesting in that, because we know where it's going to end. Good stories, you don't know where they're going to end."{{Sfn|McCabe|Farley|Edwards|2012|p=58}} "A true prequel should essentially precede the events of the original film, but be about something entirely different, feature different characters, have an entirely different theme, although it takes place in that same world."&lt;ref name="pre"/&gt;

[[File:Damon Lindelof by Gage Skidmore.jpg|upright|thumb|Writer [[Damon Lindelof]] promoting ''Prometheus'' at [[WonderCon]] in 2012. Lindelof was hired to rewrite [[Jon Spaihts]]'s original script.]]
Lindelof said that the other parts of the script were strong enough to survive without the ''Alien'' hallmarks, such as the ''Alien'' creature, which he believed had been diluted by the exposure it had received.&lt;ref name="pre"/&gt; He said, "[The producers] were just looking for someone to say to them, Hey, we don't need the ''Alien'' stuff in here. It shouldn't be about that. It can be a part of this movie, but it shouldn't be what it's about."&lt;ref name="Writing21"/&gt; Lindelof said that the film could instead run parallel to the ''Alien'' series and that a sequel would be ''Prometheus 2'' and not ''Alien'', and submitted an idea for how such a sequel could work. Lindelof met with the producers the following morning, and was hired shortly afterward in late 2010.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=84}}&lt;ref name="Writing21"/&gt; Under Lindelof, the script diverged from Spaihts's ''Alien'' prequel into an original creation.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=84}} Scott and Lindelof worked together five days a week between July and August 2010 to construct the vision Scott wanted to convey and decide what script changes were needed, including scaling back the ''Alien'' symbolism and tropes. In August and September 2010, Lindelof spent almost five weeks writing his first draft, which he submitted in mid-September 2010.&lt;ref name="Writing22"/&gt; Inspired by ''Blade Runner'' and Spaihts's script, Lindelof thought that it would be possible to combine an ''Alien'' story of action and horror with "the ''Blade Runner'' thematic,"{{Sfn|Free|Mottram|Pringle|2012|p=54}} to ask bigger questions than he felt were normally posed in science fiction films. Lindelof said,

{{quote|''Blade Runner'' might not have done well [financially] when it first came out, but people are still talking about it because it was infused with all these big ideas. [Scott] was also talking about very big themes in ''Prometheus''. It was being driven by people who wanted the answers to huge questions. But I thought that we could do that without ever getting too pretentious. Nobody wants to see a movie where people are floating in space talking about the meaning of life&amp;nbsp;... That was already present in [Spaihts's] original script and [Scott] just wanted to bring it up more.{{Sfn|Free|Mottram|Pringle|2012|p=54}}}}

Scott's story concept was partially inspired by ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', [[Erich von Däniken]]'s work about the theory of [[ancient astronauts]] which hypothesizes that life on Earth was created by aliens.&lt;ref name="filmophiliascott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CineEurope"/&gt; Scott said, "NASA and the Vatican agree that [it is] almost mathematically impossible that we can be where we are today without there being a little help along the way&amp;nbsp;... That's what we're looking at [in the film], at some of Erich von Däniken's ideas of how did we humans come about."&lt;ref name="CineEurope"/&gt; Spaihts originated the idea that David, the android, is like humans but does not want to be anything like them, eschewing a common theme in "robotic storytelling" such as ''Blade Runner''. He also developed the theme that while the human crew is searching for their creators, David is already among its creators. Scott liked these ideas and further explored them in Lindelof's rewrite.{{Sfn|McCabe|Farley|Edwards|2012|p=60}} For Shaw, Lindelof felt it was important that she was distinct from ''Alien''{{'}}s Ripley, to avoid inevitable comparisons between the two characters. In Spaihts's draft, Shaw was directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants to seek out potentially dangerous knowledge. As with David, Lindelof expanded this facet of the character during his rewrites. He spent approximately eight months developing the script, finishing in March 2011 as filming began.&lt;ref name="Writing23"/&gt;

===Pre-production===
Pre-production began in April 2010. A team developed graphic designs for the film.&lt;ref name="Development3"/&gt; Scott convinced Fox to invest millions of dollars to hire scientists and conceptual artists to develop a vision of the late 21st century.&lt;ref name="THRMay1612"/&gt; The production of ''Prometheus'' was marked by a high degree of secrecy&lt;ref name="PrePro4"/&gt; and story details were kept "extremely under-wraps."&lt;ref name="dailymail"/&gt; Ridley Scott was determined to maintain the secrecy of the plot, and he required the cast to sign clauses to prevent them disclosing story details, and the cast were allowed to read the script only under supervision in Scott's production office. One exception was made when a courier flew the script to one actor outside the US, and then stood guard while the actor read it. Scott said, "I was insistent that the script not leak onto the internet, where it gets dissected out of context, which spoils it for everyone."&lt;ref name="idrisprometheus"/&gt;

In July 2011, Lindelof said that the film would rely upon [[practical effects]], and would use [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] generally for on-set pre-visualization of external space visuals.&lt;ref name="PrePro6"/&gt; Scott said that "you can pretty much do anything you want" with digital technology,&lt;ref name="Sequel1"/&gt; and, "[[Douglas Trumbull|Doug Trumbull]] once said to me 'If you can do it live, do it live.' That was 29 years ago. Even though we have remarkable digital capabilities I still say do it live. It's cheaper."&lt;ref name="PrePro7"/&gt; Cinematographer [[Dariusz Wolski]] convinced Scott that it would be possible to film in [[3D film|3D]] with the same ease and efficiency of 2D filming. 3D company [[3ality Technica]] provided some of the rigs and equipment to facilitate 3D filming, and trained the film's crew in their proper operation.&lt;ref name="PrePro9"/&gt; According to Scott, the decision to film in 3D added $10 million to the film's budget.{{Sfn|Nashawaty|2012|p=8}} Since 3D films need high lighting levels on set, the hallmark dark and shadowy atmosphere of the ''Alien'' films was added in post-production using [[Color grading|color grading processes]], and the 3D equipment was based on post-[[Avatar (2009 film)|''Avatar'']] technology.&lt;ref name="PrePro8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ProPro8b"/&gt;

===Principal photography===
[[File:Iceland Dettifoss 1972-4.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Dettifoss|Dettifoss waterfall]] in Iceland was used in the film's opening scene showing an Engineer creating life.]]

Principal photography began on March 21, 2011, lasted 82 days, and had an estimated $120–130 million budget.&lt;ref name="THRMay1612"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filming1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filming10"/&gt; Filming began at [[Shepperton Studios]] and [[Pinewood Studios]] in England.{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=64}}&lt;ref name="FilmingUk1"/&gt; Scott used eight sound stages for filming, including the [[007 Stage]].&lt;ref name="idrisprometheus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmingUk1"/&gt; Studio space was limited and the crew had to make five stages work for approximately 16 sets, and increased the size of the 007 stage by over 30%.&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt;

Exterior shots of the alien world were shot in Iceland,{{Sfn|Nashawaty|2011|p=43}} where filming occurred for two weeks. It commenced on July 11, 2011, at the base of [[Hekla]], an active volcano in southern Iceland. Speaking about working at the volcano, Scott said, "If one is afraid of nature in this profession then it would be best to find a different job".&lt;ref name="FilmingIceland2"/&gt; Filming also took place at [[Dettifoss]], one of the most powerful waterfalls in Europe.&lt;ref name="FilmingIceland1"/&gt; The Iceland shoot involved 160 Icelandic crew members and over 200 imported crew.&lt;ref name="FilmingIceland2"/&gt; Scott said that the filming in Iceland comprised approximately fifteen minutes of footage for the film, and that the area represented the beginning of time.&lt;ref name="Filming5"/&gt; [[Morocco]] had been chosen as a location for these scenes, but the 2010 [[Arab Spring]] protests forced the change of venue.&lt;ref name="THRMay1612"/&gt; Alternatives including the [[Mojave Desert]] had been considered,&lt;ref name="FilmingIceland3"/&gt; but Scott explained that [[Iceland]] was ultimately chosen because "here it is so rough and 'Jurassic-like' and that proved decisive".&lt;ref name="FilmingIceland2"/&gt;

In September 2011, filming moved to the [[Ciudad de la Luz]] audiovisual complex in [[Alicante]], Spain. Shooting areas included the complex's large water tank, and a nearby beach.&lt;ref name="Filming6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filming7"/&gt; The complex was booked from August 22, 2011, through to December 10, 2011, and set construction occurred from August until late September.&lt;ref name="Filming6"/&gt; Approximately 250 people worked on the three-month-long Spain shoot, generating over [[Euro|€]]1 million in the local economy.&lt;ref name="Filming8"/&gt; Filming also took place in the [[Wadi Rum]] valley in Jordan.&lt;ref name="THRMay1612"/&gt;

Scott avoided using green screens unless necessary. Instead, he used various items so the actors would know where they should be looking in any particular scene on the practical sets where CGI elements would be inserted in post-production.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=86}} Rapace said that green screens were used fewer than six times during filming.{{Sfn|McCabe|Farley|Edwards|2012|p=58}} The production used five 3ality Technical Atom 3D rigs, four of which were configured with [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red Epic]] 3D cameras set on [[Camera dolly|camera dollies]] and tripods, which were continuously in use during filming. The fifth rig used an Epic camera as a [[steadicam]], which was used only occasionally.&lt;ref name="PrePro9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filming3"/&gt;

===Post-production===
Scott used the 3D footage to increase the [[stereoscopy|illusion of depth]]. Despite this being his first 3D film he found the process easy. He said, "You can literally twiddle a knob and the depth will increase", and, "the trick is not to overdo it".{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=86}} In December 2011, Rapace undertook [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|additional dialogue recordings]] for the film.&lt;ref name="colliderrapaceinterview"/&gt; Additional [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-up]] scenes were filmed during January 2012, including a one-day shoot on the [[Isle of Skye]], Scotland, and a new scene shot at a cave in the Scottish mountains.&lt;ref name="Skye"/&gt;{{Sfn|Free|Mottram|Pringle|2012|p=56}}&lt;ref name="PostPro21"/&gt; For dark scenes, the film was color graded to specifically compensate for the light loss of 3D glasses, to ensure the image was comparable to the 2D version.&lt;ref name="PostPro20"/&gt;

In July 2011, Scott said that he was filming ''Prometheus'' with both adult-oriented R and more accessible PG-13 [[Film rating#United States|film ratings]] in mind, allowing the more adult content to be cut if necessary without harming the overall presentation. Scott said he had a responsibility to 20th Century Fox to be able to present a PG-13 cut of the film if the studio demanded, allowing it to be viewed by a wider potential audience.&lt;ref name="PostPro1"/&gt; When asked about the rating, Scott said, "the question is, do you go for the PG-13, or do you go for what it should be, which is R? Financially it makes quite a difference&amp;nbsp;... essentially it's kinda R&amp;nbsp;... it's not just about blood, it's about ideas that are very stressful."{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=77}} Scott also said that, regardless of rating, he would present the most aggressive cut of the film he could,{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=77}} while Rothman said that Scott would not be forced to compromise the film's quality to avoid an R-rating.&lt;ref name="PostPro3"/&gt; On May 7, 2012, Fox confirmed that the film had received an R-rating and would be released without any cuts being made.&lt;ref name="Rating1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PostPro5"/&gt; According to Scott, the scene of Shaw surgically removing her alien offspring was the significant cause of the restrictive rating, and it was suggested that removing the scene entirely would be the only way to gain a lower one.&lt;ref name="Editing1"/&gt; A fight scene between Shaw and the Engineer was shortened because Scott decided that Shaw directly wounding the Engineer diminished his role.&lt;ref name="HomeMedia3"/&gt; Scott concluded work on the film in March 2012.&lt;ref name="Release6"/&gt;

===Music===
{{see also|Prometheus (soundtrack)}}

[[Marc Streitenfeld]], who had worked with Scott on earlier projects, composed the musical score for ''Prometheus''.&lt;ref name="Music1"/&gt; It took just over a week to record with a 90-piece orchestra at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, England.&lt;ref name="SME"/&gt; Streitenfeld began writing ideas for the score after reading the script before filming commenced. He used some unusual techniques to compose the score, and said, "I actually wrote out the sheet music backwards so the orchestra played it backwards and then I digitally flipped it. So you're hearing the score as it's written, the same melody, but with a backwards sounding orchestra which gives it a kind of unusual, unsettling sound."&lt;ref name="SME"/&gt; The ''Prometheus (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)'' album was released on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] on May 15, 2012,&lt;ref name="Soundtrack3"/&gt; and on CD on June 4, 2012.&lt;ref name="Soundtrack1"/&gt; It features 23 tracks by Streitenfeld and two supplemental tracks by [[Harry Gregson-Williams]].&lt;ref name="Soundtrack4"/&gt; [[Frédéric Chopin]]{{'}}s "[[Raindrop prelude]]" (1838) is also featured in the film.&lt;ref name="MusicChopin1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MusicChopin2"/&gt;

==Design==
[[Production designer]] [[Arthur Max]] led the film's design staff. His art team were tasked with deconstructing the art and visuals of ''Alien'', and reverse-designing them for the chronologically earlier setting of ''Prometheus''.&lt;ref name="PrePro3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Design2"/&gt; Influence was drawn from the work of ''Alien'' creature designer [[H. R. Giger]], and designers [[Ron Cobb]] and [[Chris Foss]], including their designs for that film which Scott had been unable to develop at the time.&lt;ref name="Design2"/&gt;

===Costume design===
For the crew's space suits, Scott was inspired to include spherical glass helmets after reading a story in [[Steve Jobs]]' biography about building an office out of [[Gorilla Glass]]. Scott said, "If I'm in 2083 and I'm going into space, why would I design a helmet that has blind spots. What I want is something where I have 360 [vision]. Glass, by then, will be light and you won't be able to break it with a bullet."&lt;ref name="MiscWonderCon12"/&gt; The interior of the prop helmets had nine functioning video screens, internal lighting, an air supply provided by two fans, and battery packs concealed within a backpack. The helmet's exterior featured a functional light source and high definition video cameras with a transmitter and recorder. For the suit itself, Scott wanted to avoid the unwieldy NASA-style suit. His frequent collaborator, [[Janty Yates]], used medical research concepts relating to skin replacement treatments and materials to develop a garment that would be believable, flexible and comfortable. The outfit comprised a [[neoprene]] suit worn under an outer space suit, a base to which the helmet could be attached, and a backpack.&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt;

Aboard the ship, Yates gave the characters their own distinct looks. Theron is dressed in an ice-silver, silk mohair suit. Yates said, "[Theron] is the ice queen. It was always our vision to make her look as sculptural as possible". Fassbender's David is dressed similarly to other crew members, but his outfit was given finer lines to produce a more linear appearance. To create a casual, relaxed appearance, Marshall-Green's Holloway was dressed in hoodies, fisherman pants, and flip-flops, while Elba wore a canvas-greased jacket to represent his long career at the helm of a ship.&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt;

===Sets and vehicles===
Arthur Max designed the sets such as the alien world landscape and structures, and the vehicles, including the ''Prometheus'' and the Engineer's ship.{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=64}}&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt; Digital 3D models and miniature replicas of each set were built to allow the designers to envisage the connections between them and to know where the CGI elements would be inserted. To better blend the practical and the digital, the design team took rock samples from the Iceland location so they could match the graphical textures with the real rocks.&lt;ref name="Design30"/&gt; To create the ''Prometheus'', Max researched NASA and [[European Space Agency]] spacecraft designs, and extended these concepts with his own ideas of how future space vehicles might look. He said that he wanted "to do something that was state-of-the-art, which would represent a flagship spacecraft with every technology required to probe into the deepest corners of the galaxy."&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt;

The interior of the ''Prometheus'' was built across a two-level structure, fronted by a large, faceted, wrap around windscreen. Theron's quarters were designed to represent her high status in the crew, and were furnished with modern and futuristic items, including Swarovski chandeliers and a [[Fazioli]] piano.&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt; The ship's garage was built on the backlot of Pinewood Studios in England. The vehicles inside were built in 11 weeks and were designed to operate on difficult terrain while having a futuristic aesthetic. Max created a large pyramid structure for the alien world, which had its main interior areas connected by a series of chambers, corridors, and tunnels; it was so large that some members of the film crew became lost inside it. The pyramid was enhanced in post-production to further increase its size.&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt; One of the key sets, the chamber where the crew find the humanoid-head statue, was designed to resemble the interior of a cathedral and convey a quasi-religious impression.&lt;ref name="Design2"/&gt; Giger designed the murals that appear within the chamber.&lt;ref name="filmophiliascott" /&gt;

For the scene of the ''Prometheus''{{'}} descent to the alien moon LV-223, visual effects art director Steven Messing referenced NASA imagery, including vortex cloud structures. He also used aerial photographs of locations in Iceland and Wadi Rum shot by VFX supervisor [[Richard Stammers]] and his team. Messing painted over these images and combined them with 3D set extensions to create a realistic altered landscape. Scott wanted the ship's descent scenes to have a sense of grandeur to contrast the dark and shrouded descent featured in ''Alien''. Much of LV-223s world was based upon the world visited in ''Alien'', but scaled back as Scott felt some elements were too unrealistic. Other influences were the Martian mountain [[Olympus Mons]] and several large mountain structures on Earth. NASA advisers provided concepts for the aesthetics of alien worlds which were incorporated into the design work.&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt; MPC developed a digital representation of Wadi Rum using the design material, modified it to locate the alien pyramid and a landing area for the ''Prometheus'', and resized the planet's natural features relative to the alien structures.&lt;ref name="DesignVFX1"/&gt;

[[Neal Scanlan]] and [[Conor O'Sullivan (make-up artist)|Conor O'Sullivan]] developed the film's alien creatures, aiming to convey that each creature has a logical biological function and purpose. Scanlan said that much of Scott's inspiration for creature design is drawn from natural life, such as plants and sea creatures.&lt;ref name="Design1"/&gt; Creature designer Carlos Huante chose to make the creature designs pale to contrast the black-toned, Giger-influenced aesthetic of ''Alien''. Huante designed them to be white and embryonic because the events in the film occur before Giger's influence had taken effect. Huante took influences from references Scott was using to design the pale-skinned Engineers. Huante also referenced other Giger works, national monuments, large sculptures, and the [[Crazy Horse Memorial]] statue in South Dakota. Part of Huante's early design work included developing precursors to ''Alien''{{'}}s Facehugger, and a primitive ''Alien'' creature, but these were cut from the final release. When designing the Engineers, Scott and Huante referenced paintings by William Blake and [[J. M. W. Turner]], and classical sculptures.&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt; Scott wanted the Engineers to resemble [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman]] gods, and instructed designer [[Neville Page]] to reference the [[Statue of Liberty]], Michelangelo's ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', and [[Elvis Presley]].&lt;ref name="Design51"/&gt; The 8-foot tall, humanoid Engineers were created by applying bulky, full-body prosthetics to the actors, whose facial features were diminished by the material, and were later digitally enhanced to preserve the "godlike" physical perfection.&lt;ref name="Design50"/&gt; Scott described the Engineers as tall, elegant "dark angels".&lt;ref name="Theme1"/&gt;

The snake-like alien dubbed the "Hammerpede" was given life through a mixture of CGI and practical effects, and the wires controlling the practical puppet were digitally removed. For a scene in which the Hammerpede is decapitated, the VFX team digitally animated and inserted the spontaneous growth of a replacement head.&lt;ref name="DesignVFX1"/&gt; During the scene in which the Hammerpede erupts from Spall's character's corpse, Scott controlled the puppet using wires. Scott did not inform Dickie about what was to occur in the scene and her screaming reaction was real. The creature's design was partially inspired by translucent sea creatures with visible arteries, veins, and organs beneath the skin's surface, and cobras. The designers gave the creature a smooth, muscular, and powerful appearance. Early designs of the "Trilobite", the tentacled offspring cut from Shaw, resembled an octopus or squid. Page redeveloped this creature as an embryo in an early state of development, with tentacles that began fused together and would gradually split, creating new tentacles, as the creature developed.&lt;ref name="DesignCreature1"/&gt; The practical creature was a remotely operated [[Animatronics|animatronic]] creation with a silicone skin.&lt;ref name="Editing1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesignCreature1"/&gt;

The mutated Fifield effects were achieved mainly through the use of make-up and prosthetics. Due to concerns that the practical effects would be unsatisfactory, the filmmakers completed an alternative version of the sequence, in which Fifield was rendered as "a digital character with elongated limbs and an engorged, translucent head, incorporating a semblance of Harris's face".&lt;ref name="Fifield1"/&gt; Three other variations of the mutated Fifield were modeled, but these were rejected as being too inhuman.&lt;ref name="Fifield2"/&gt;

For its grown form, the "Adult Trilobite", Max found inspiration from an [[arthropod]]-like creature from Earth's [[Cambrian]] period, and the alien octopus in [[Jean Giraud]]'s illustrations for the comic strip ''[[The Long Tomorrow (comics)|The Long Tomorrow]]''. Further inspiration came after Max found a formaldehyde-preserved giant squid, an image which met with Scott's approval. The film's last-unveiled creature, the "[[Proto-Xenomorph|Deacon]]", was named by Scott for its long, pointed head that he considered resembled a bishop's mitre. Scanlan aimed to represent the creature's genetic lineage, beginning with Shaw and Holloway who produce the Trilobite which impregnates the Engineer, in its design. However, the creature was given a somewhat feminine appearance, since "it was born of a female before being born of a male." Messing drew inspiration for the Deacon's birth scene from the birth of foals, and created an iridescent appearance for its skin, based on the equine placenta.&lt;ref name="DesignCreature1"/&gt; The Deacon's protruding jaw was inspired by the [[goblin shark]].&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt;

===Sound effects===
Sound effects were generated with a variety of sources including [[Pop Rocks]]—a brand of popping candy—and a parrot. The glistening ice forming on the stone cylinders discovered in the film was created by applying the popping candy to materials such as wet metal and stone that was then sprayed with water to produce the "popping, cracking" sound. Sound designer Ann Scibelli's parrot was recorded over several weeks to document her variety of vocalizations which were then used as beeps, alarms and the cries of Shaw's alien offspring.&lt;ref name="DesignSound"/&gt;

===Visual effects===
[[File:Wright of Derby, The Orrery.jpg|thumb|right|The film's star map sequence was inspired by [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]]'s painting ''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]''.&lt;ref name="Writing2"/&gt;]]

''Prometheus'' contains approximately 1,300 digital effect shots.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=86}} The main effects studio was [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC), which produced 420 of the shots.&lt;ref name="PostPro20"/&gt; Several other studios, including [[Weta Digital]],&lt;ref name="THRMay1612"/&gt; Fuel VFX,&lt;ref name="PostPro2"/&gt; [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Luma Pictures]], Lola Visual Effects, and Hammerhead Productions, also produced effects shots for the film.&lt;ref name="PostPro10"/&gt;

The creation of life from the disintegration of an Engineer in the film's opening scene was created by WETA Digital. The scene was difficult to produce because it had to convey the story of the Engineer's DNA breaking apart, reforming and recombining into Earth DNA in a limited span of time. The team focused on making the DNA stages distinct to convey its changing nature. Scott requested the studio to focus on the destruction occurring within the Engineer. A light color scheme was used for the Engineer's DNA and decayed fish spines were used as an image reference, while the infected DNA had a melted appearance. To find methods of depicting the DNA destruction, the team carved vein-like structures from silicone and pumped black ink and oils into them while filming the changes occurring over an extended period of time.&lt;ref name="DesignVFX3"/&gt;

A key scene involving a large 3D hologram star map, dubbed the [[Orrery]], was inspired by the 1766 [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]] painting ''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]'', in which a scientist displays a mechanical planetarium by candlelight. While discussing the necessity of a star map with Spaihts, Scott mentioned that he envisaged a physical representation being similar to the painting, although he was unaware of its title and described it as "circles in circles with a candle lit image". Using Scott's description, Spaihts located an image of the painting. Spaihts said, "making the leap from a star map, to an Enlightenment painting, and then back into the far future. [Scott's] mind just multiplexes in that way".&lt;ref name="Writing2"/&gt; The Orrery was one of the most complex visual effects, contained 80–100 million polygons, and took several weeks to render as a single, complete shot.&lt;ref name="DesignVFX1"/&gt;

==Marketing==
[[File:Ridley Scott, Charlize Theron &amp; Michael Fassbender by Gage Skidmore.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ridley Scott]], [[Charlize Theron]], and [[Michael Fassbender]] promoting the film at [[WonderCon]] in March 2012]]

''Prometheus''{{'}} marketing campaign began on July 21, 2011 at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], where images and footage from the film were presented by Lindelof and Theron; Scott and Rapace participated via [[satellite contribution]].&lt;ref name="scottbeams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing10"/&gt; A segment of the footage showed Theron performing naked push-ups, which attracted much attention.&lt;ref name="dailymail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing12"/&gt; A teaser poster was released on December 14, 2011, with the tagline, "The search for our beginning could lead to our end."&lt;ref name="Marketing14"/&gt; A bootleg recording of an incomplete trailer was leaked online on November 27, 2011, but was quickly taken down by Fox.&lt;ref name="Marketing15"/&gt; The trailer was released on December 22, 2011.&lt;ref name="Marketing19"/&gt;

On March 17, 2012, Scott, in partnership with [[AMC Theatres]], hosted the premiere of the first full ''Prometheus'' trailer at the AMC Downtown Disney during [[WonderCon]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. The event was streamed live via Facebook, Twitter, and the AMC Theatre website, and the trailer was posted on AMC's YouTube channel immediately after its debut.&lt;ref name="MarketingFull1"/&gt; Reactions to the trailer from WonderCon attendees, and on Twitter, were generally positive,&lt;ref name="Marketing17"/&gt; and it received nearly three million views in the three days following its release.&lt;ref name="Marketing30"/&gt; On April 10, 2012, media outlets were shown a 13-minute montage of scenes in 3D from the film's opening at the [[Vue Cinemas|Vue Cinema]] in Leicester Square, London.&lt;ref name="Marketing41"/&gt; The screening, and in particular the 3D visuals and the performances of Fassbender, Rapace, Theron, and Elba, was well received.&lt;ref name="Marketing40"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing42"/&gt;

On April 29, 2012, the international launch trailer debuted in the United Kingdom on [[Channel 4]] during the first advertisement break of the TV show ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]''. Viewers were encouraged to share their opinions about the trailer on Twitter, some of which were then shared in a live broadcast during a later break. This was the first time that viewers' tweets were used in a broadcast advertisement.&lt;ref name="Marketing50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing51"/&gt; A competition, offering viewers a chance to win tickets to the film whenever the social platform [[Zeebox]] detected the advertisement airing, was launched on that site.&lt;ref name="Marketing52"/&gt; On May 8, 2012, the advertisement became the subject of an investigation by the British broadcasting regulatory body [[Ofcom]] for allegedly breaching broadcast rules when a voiceover encouraged viewers to book tickets during the advertisement with the {{nowrap|Channel 4}} logo onscreen. The broadcast potentially broke a ruling that advertising and teleshopping must be clearly distinguishable from editorial content.&lt;ref name="Marketing54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing55"/&gt;

Although marketers typically avoid promoting adult-oriented films to reach a broader demographic, the film attracted several promotional partners including [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and [[Verizon FiOS]], which were estimated to have spent $30 million in marketing support. Amazon directed interested users to purchase tickets through [[Fandango (ticket service)|Fandango]], and placed promotional material in products shipped to customers; this was the first time that Amazon had allowed such marketing by an external company.&lt;ref name="Marketing71"/&gt; The premiere in London was streamed live via the film's website and the Verizon FiOS Facebook page. The event was facilitated by BumeBox, which took audience questions from social sites and gave them to reporters to ask at the event.&lt;ref name="Premiere"/&gt; The [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association]] (NECA) released a series of ''Prometheus'' action figures in September 2012.&lt;ref name="MarketingToy1"/&gt; A book, ''Prometheus: The Art of the Film'', containing production art and behind-the-scenes photographs, was released on June 12, 2012.&lt;ref name="MarketingBook1"/&gt;

===Viral campaign===
[[File:Prometheus Viral 3 - David.jpg|thumb|upright|An advertisement for "David" (portrayed by Michael Fassbender) printed in newspapers. The advert highlights the viral website campaign and the film's marketing partnership with [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]].]]
A viral marketing campaign began on February 28, 2012, with the release of a video featuring a speech by Pearce, in character as Peter Weyland, about his vision for the future. Set in 2023, the ''TED 2023'' video presents a futuristic vision of a [[TED (conference)|TED]] conference, an annual technology and design event held in [[Long Beach, California]]. The segment was conceived and designed by Scott and Lindelof, and directed by Scott's son, Luke. The production was made in collaboration with, and made available through TED because Lindelof wanted to introduce new audiences to the conference itself. Lindelof said that the scene takes place in a futuristic stadium because "a guy like Peter Weyland—whose ego is just massive, and the ideas that he's advancing are nothing short of hubris—that he'd basically say to TED, 'If you want me to give a talk, I'm giving it in [[Wembley Stadium]].{{' "}}&lt;ref name="MarketingTED"/&gt;

TED community director Tom Rielly helped the film's producers gain approval for the use of the TED brand, which had not previously been used for promotional purposes. Rielly was involved in designing the 2023 conference, and said that the association generated millions of unique visits to the TED website.&lt;ref name="Marketing31"/&gt; The video's release was accompanied by a fictional TED blog about the 2023 conference and a tie-in website for the fictional Weyland Corporation.&lt;ref name="CastPearce1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketing21"/&gt; On March 6, 2012, the Weyland website was updated to allow visitors to invest in the company as part of a game, which would reveal new ''Prometheus'' media.&lt;ref name="MarketingArg1"/&gt;

During the 2012 WonderCon, attendees at the film's panel were given Weyland Corporation business cards that directed them to a website and telephone number. After calling the number, the caller was sent a text message from Weyland Corporation that linked them to a video that was presented as an advertisement for the "David 8" android, narrated by Fassbender.&lt;ref name="MarketingViral2"/&gt; An extended version of the video, released on April 17, 2012, lists the android's features, including its ability to seamlessly replicate human emotions without the restrictions of ethics or distress.&lt;ref name="MarketingViral3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarketingViral4"/&gt; A full page "David 8" advertisement was placed in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''; a Twitter account operated by a David8, that allowed Twitter users to ask the character questions, was included.&lt;ref name="MarketingViral16"/&gt; A partnership with Verizon FiOS was launched, offering a virtual tour of the ''Prometheus'' spaceship.&lt;ref name="MarketingViral16"/&gt; Another video, "Quiet Eye", starring Rapace as Shaw, was released on May 16, 2012, and debuted on the Verizon FIOS Facebook page.&lt;ref name="Premiere"/&gt; In a telephone call monitored by Yutani, a fictional company from the ''Alien'' series, Shaw requests Weyland's aid to seek out alien life.&lt;ref name="MarketingViral17"/&gt; In France, the [[Saint-Martin (Paris Métro)|Saint-Martin]] [[ghost station|ghost train station]] was converted to resemble alien architecture from the film, and was visible to passing commuters.&lt;ref name="Marketing73"/&gt; The campaign continued after the film's release with a website that was listed during the film's end credits. The site referenced the philosophical novel ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and featured a video of Weyland, who quotes from the book.&lt;ref name="MarketingViral20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarketingViral21"/&gt; Another video followed in September 2012, featuring Elba's Captain Janek preparing for a mission.&lt;ref name="MarketingViralSep"/&gt;

At the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof said that the videos originated from the question of the film's status as an ''Alien'' prequel. It was decided that creating videos with the film's stars would generate more interest than any commentary about its connection to the ''Alien'' films. He also said that the videos needed to be cool enough to justify their existence, but not so important that their absence from the final film would be an issue for audiences.&lt;ref name="MarketingViral18"/&gt;

==Release==
The premiere of ''Prometheus'' took place on May 31, 2012, at the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire cinema]] in Leicester Square, London.&lt;ref name="Release6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Premiere2"/&gt; The film was released in the United Kingdom on {{nowrap|June 1}}, 2012,&lt;ref name="Rating1"/&gt; and in North America on {{nowrap|June 8}}, 2012.&lt;ref name="Release1"/&gt; It was simultaneously released in [[IMAX]] theaters and in 3D,&lt;ref name="Release2"/&gt; and it is encoded for [[D-Box Technologies|D-Box]] motion seats that provide physical feedback to the audience during the film.&lt;ref name="ReleaseDBox"/&gt;

===Pre-release===
In the United Kingdom, approximately £1 million ($1.6 million) of tickets were pre-sold.&lt;ref name="BOInternational1"/&gt; 18,827 tickets pre-sold for the [[London IMAX]], the largest IMAX screen in the country, which broke the theater records for the highest grossing week of pre-sales with £293,312 ($474,687), and the highest grossing first day of pre-sales with £137,000 ($221,717).&lt;ref name="Release3"/&gt; It extended this record to 30,000 tickets sold and £470,977 ($737,588) earned, and become the most pre-booked film at that theater, exceeding the performance of high-profile IMAX releases including ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2]]'' and ''Avatar''.&lt;ref name="Release4"/&gt;

In North America, audience tracking showed high interest among males, but low among females.&lt;ref name="ReleaseUSPre"/&gt; In the week before the film's release, predictions were conflicted on whether ''Prometheus'' or ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (the first family-oriented film of the summer),&lt;ref name="chicago1"/&gt; which were released simultaneously, would reach number 1 for that weekend. On June 6, 2012, Fandango reported that with 42% of daily sales ''Prometheus'' was beating ''Madagascar 3''. The online tracking for ''Prometheus'' surged with each additional promotional footage.&lt;ref name="boxofficecom1"/&gt; ''Prometheus'' was predicted to earn approximately $30 million, and ''Madagascar 3'' around $45 million.&lt;ref name="THR-predict"/&gt; As the weekend approached, tracking suggested a $55 million debut for ''Madagascar 3'' and $50–$55 million for ''Prometheus''.&lt;ref name="latimes-predict"/&gt; ''Prometheus'' was disadvantaged by ''Madagascar'' opening in 264 more theaters and its adult rating.&lt;ref name="BOM-forecast"/&gt;

===Box office===
''Prometheus'' was considered a financial success overall. After a strong start in North America, the film failed to meet the studio's expectations, but it continued to perform strongly in other territories until the end of its theatrical run.&lt;ref name="BOSuccess"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BOSuccess2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BOSuccess3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BOSuccess4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BOSuccess5"/&gt; ''Prometheus'' earned $126.4 million (31.4%) in North America and $276.9 million (68.6%) elsewhere for a worldwide total of $403.4 million,&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt; making it the 18th highest-grossing film of 2012,&lt;ref name="BOM2012"/&gt; and at its peak it was the 155th highest-grossing film worldwide unadjusted for inflation.&lt;ref name="BOMalltime"/&gt;

&lt;!--Markets elsewhere--&gt;
''Prometheus'' was released in 15 markets between May 30 and June 1, 2012—about a week before its North American release. The earlier start in these countries was timed to avoid competition with the start of the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 UEFA European Football Championship]] the following week. On its opening day, which varies depending on the country, it earned $3.39 million in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="BOInternational2"/&gt; $2.2 million in Russia,&lt;ref name="BoInternational3"/&gt; and $1.5 million in France.&lt;ref name="BOInternational1"/&gt; The film earned $34.8 million during its opening weekend from 4,695 theaters in 15 markets, and debuted at number 1 in 14 of them, with an average of $7,461 per theater. Its overall rank for the weekend was third behind ''[[Men in Black 3]]'' and ''[[Snow White &amp; the Huntsman]]''.&lt;ref name="BOInterOpeningWeekend"/&gt; Its opening weekends in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($10.1 million), Russia and the CIS ($9.80 million), and France and the Maghreb region ($6.68 million) represented its largest takings.&lt;ref name="BOM-overseas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BOInterOpeningWeekend2"/&gt; By June 8, the film had opened in a total of 50 markets, and was also successful during its opening weekends in Australia ($7.2 million) and South Korea ($4.2 million).&lt;ref name="overseas-second"/&gt; During its late August opening in Japan, the film earned $9.6 million.&lt;ref name="BOIntJAP"/&gt;

&lt;!--North America--&gt;
In North America, ''Prometheus'' earned $3.561 million in midnight showings at 1,368 theaters, including $1.03 million from 294 IMAX theaters, and went on to earn $21.4 million through its opening day.&lt;ref name="BONA1"/&gt; During its opening weekend, the film earned $51.05 million from 3,396 theaters—an average of $15,032 per theater—ranking second behind ''Madagascar 3'' ($60.4 million), which made it the second largest opening for a film directed by Scott behind his 2001 thriller ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'', the third largest second-place opening, the ninth largest opening for a prequel, and the tenth largest for an R-rated film. The largest demographic of the opening weekend audience was over the age of 25 (64%) and male (57%). 3D showings accounted for 54% of ticket sales, while IMAX contributed 18%—the majority of which was accounted for in the 3D figure.&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BOM-opening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BONA2"/&gt; The film closed on September 20, 2012 after 105 days (15 weeks) in release with a total gross of $126.4 million. The figure made it the number 43 highest-grossing film to never finish a week as the number 1 film.&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt;

===Critical reception===
[[File:Michael Fassbender by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Michael Fassbender in 2012. Critics were near unanimous in praise for his portrayal of the android David.]]

The film garnered a 73% approval rating from 288 critics—an [[weighted mean|average]] rating of 7/10 on the review-aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which said, "Ridley Scott's ambitious quasi-prequel to ''Alien'' may not answer all of its big questions, but it's redeemed by its haunting visual grandeur and compelling performances—particularly Michael Fassbender as a fastidious android."&lt;ref name="RottenTomatoes" /&gt; [[Metacritic]] provides a score of 65 out of 100 from 42 critics, which indicates "generally favorable" reviews.&lt;ref name="Metacritic" /&gt; [[CinemaScore]] polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a "B" on a scale of A+ to F, while audience members under 25 rated it the highest at A-.&lt;ref name="BONA1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BONA3" /&gt; Reviews frequently praised both the film's visual aesthetic and design, and Fassbender's performance as the android David received almost universal acclaim. However the plot drew a mixed response from critics, who criticized plot elements that remained unresolved or were predictable, tempered by appreciation for the action and horror set-pieces.&lt;ref name="RottenTomatoes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RevSum1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevSum2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevSum3"/&gt;

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s [[Todd McCarthy]] called the film's visuals vivid, stunning, and magnificent on a technical level, and praised the performances of Fassbender, Rapace, and Theron, but wrote that the film "caters too much to imagined audience expectations when a little more adventurous thought might have taken it to some excitingly unsuspected destinations."&lt;ref name="RevTHR"/&gt; ''[[Time Out London]]''{{'}}s Tom Huddleston wrote that "the photography is pleasingly crisp and the design is stunning", but that, "[t]he script feels flat&amp;nbsp;... the dialogue is lazy, while the plot, though crammed with striking concepts, simply fails to coalesce. After an enjoyable setup, the central act is baggy, confusing and, in places, slightly boring, while the climax has flash and fireworks but no real momentum."&lt;ref name="RevTimeOutLon"/&gt; [[Emanuel Levy]] wrote that the writing was his only complaint about the film, which, he said, "is not only uneven, but promises more original ideas and thematic provocations than it can possibly deliver."&lt;ref name="RevLevy"/&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, labeling it a "seamless blend of story, special effects and pitch-perfect casting, filmed in sane, effective 3-D that doesn't distract." Ebert wrote that Rapace's performance "continues here the tradition of awesome feminine strength begun by Sigourney Weaver in ''Alien''", but considered that Elba's Janek has the most interesting character evolution. Ebert thought that the plot raises questions and does not answer them, which made the film intriguing and parallel to the "classic tradition of golden age sci-fi".&lt;ref name="RevEbert"/&gt; He later went on to name it as one of the best films of 2012.&lt;ref name="RevEbert2"/&gt;

''[[Total Film]]''{{'}}s Jonathan Crocker wrote that the plot successfully integrated itself with ''Alien''{{'}}s mythology while offering its own original ideas.&lt;ref name="RevTotalFilm"/&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Lisa Schwarzbaum was positive towards the cast, particularly Rapace, and the cinematography.&lt;ref name="RevEW"/&gt; ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''{{'}}s Andrew O'Hehir wrote that the film was "somber, spectacular and ponderous", but that the "portentousness and grandiosity&amp;nbsp;... is at once the film's great strength and great weakness" and criticized the characters for lacking common sense. O'Hehir also mentioned Wolski's cinematography and Max's production design.&lt;ref name="RevSalon"/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]''' [[A. O. Scott]] criticized the story as weak, and argued that the narrative's twists and reversals undermine its "lofty, mindblowing potential". He said the film has no revelations, just "bits of momentarily surprising information bereft of meaning or resonance", and that Rapace is a "fine heroine, vulnerable and determined".&lt;ref name="RevNYT"/&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' film critic Justin Chang wrote that the film's narrative structure was unable to handle the philosophical dimension of the plot, and that ''Prometheus'' was lazily deferring key plot points under the presumption that a sequel would be made.&lt;ref name="RevVariety"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' [[Peter Bradshaw]] wrote that ''Prometheus'' was "more grandiose, more elaborate—but less interesting" than ''Alien'', and lacked the latter's "central killer punch".&lt;ref name="RevGuardian"/&gt; Ian Nathan of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine was unimpressed by Rapace—whom he described as an unconvincing lead—and said that with "a lack of suspense, threadbare characters, and a very poor script, the stunning visuals, gloopy madness, and sterling Fassbenderiness can't prevent ''Prometheus'' feeling like ''Alien''{{'}}s poor relation."&lt;ref name="RevEmpire"/&gt; ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s Nick Pinkerton wrote that the film is "prone to shallow ponderousness", and that Scott "can still mimic the appearance of an epic, noble, important movie—but the appearance is all." He criticized Rapace and Marshall-Green for failing to instill interest in their characters' relationship, but added: "there are a few set pieces here that will find a place of honor among aficionados of body horror and all things clammy and viscous".&lt;ref name="RevVillageVoice"/&gt;

James Cameron said: "I enjoyed ''Prometheus''. I thought it was great. I thought it was Ridley returning to science fiction with gusto, with great tactical performance, beautiful photography, great native 3D. There might have been a few things that I would have done differently, but that's not the point—you could say that about any movie."&lt;ref name="Cameron"/&gt;

===Home media===
In North America, ''Prometheus'' DVD and Blu-ray disc releases were listed for pre-order in partnership with Amazon on June 1, 2012, a week before the film was released in theaters. A limited number of cinema tickets for the film were offered as a pre-order incentive.&lt;ref name="HomeBRay1"/&gt; In June 2012, ''[[FX (TV channel)|FX]]'' obtained the rights to the film's network television premiere.&lt;ref name="HomeMedia4"/&gt; On September 7, 2012, Fox announced that ''Prometheus'' would be the launch title of its new digital distribution initiative "Digital HD". The film was released on September 18, 2012, three weeks prior to its DVD, Blu-ray disc and [[Video on demand]] (VOD) release, for downloading and streaming through platforms including Amazon, iTunes, [[PlayStation Network]] and [[Xbox Live]] in over 50 countries.&lt;ref name="HomeDigital"/&gt; The film was released on Blu-ray disc and DVD on October 9, 2012.&lt;ref name="HomeMedia2"/&gt; The Blu-ray disc edition of the film was released in a 2-disc set and a 4-disc "Collector's Edition". Both versions contain the theatrical cut of ''Prometheus'', commentary by Scott, Lindelof and Spaihts, a DVD and digital copy of the film, [[Alternate ending|alternate]] and deleted scenes, and other features. Additionally, the Collector's Edition contains the 3D version of the film and approximately 7 hours of supplemental features including a documentary on the film's production.&lt;ref name="HomeMedia5"/&gt; On October 8, 2012, it was reported that Fox had requested an extended version of the film for home media, but Scott refused to edit cut scenes back into the theatrical version of the film, which he considered his director's cut.&lt;ref name="HomeMedia10"/&gt; During its first week of sale in the United Kingdom, ''Prometheus'' was the number 1 selling film on DVD and Blu-ray Disc, outselling its nearest competitor by a factor of three.&lt;ref name="HomeUK1"/&gt; An [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] version is scheduled for release in September 2017.&lt;ref name="HomeMediaUBR1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HomeMediaUBR2"/&gt;

==Sequels==
{{main|Alien: Covenant}}
Scott discussed a continuation of the series in March 2012, saying that ''Prometheus'' leaves many questions unanswered and that these could be answered in a sequel.&lt;ref name="Sequel2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sequel1"/&gt; In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved so that they could be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that ''Prometheus'' could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed.&lt;ref name="Sequel4"/&gt; By August 2012, a sequel was announced to be in development for release no earlier than 2014.&lt;ref name="Sequel8"/&gt; Lindelof chose not to work on the new film, citing other commitments.&lt;ref name="SequelDec2012"/&gt; Titled ''[[Alien: Covenant]]'',&lt;ref name="SequelTitle"/&gt; the sequel premiered in London, England on May 4, 2017,&lt;ref name="AlienLondon"/&gt; and was released in the United States on May 19, 2017.&lt;ref name="AlienUS"/&gt; Set eleven years after the events of ''Prometheus'',&lt;ref name="Sequel10"/&gt; ''Alien: Covenant''{{'}}s story follows the crew of the Covenant space ship who land on an uncharted and seemingly uninhabited planet. The film stars [[Katherine Waterston]],&lt;ref name="SequelWaterson"/&gt; [[Danny McBride]],&lt;ref name="SequelMcBride"/&gt; [[Demian Bichir]],&lt;ref name="SequelBelchir"/&gt; [[Jussie Smollett]], [[Amy Seimetz]], [[Carmen Ejogo]], [[Callie Hernandez]], Alex England and [[Billy Crudup]].&lt;ref name="SequelEngland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sequeltherest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SequelBilly"/&gt; On release, ''Alien: Covenant'' earned a worldwide box office gross of $240.7 million (compared to ''Prometheus''{{'}} $403.4 million),&lt;ref name="SequelBOM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt; and received generally favorable reviews.&lt;ref name="SequelMC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SequelRT"/&gt; A sequel to ''Alien: Covenant'' is in development.&lt;ref name="SequelSequel"/&gt;

In 2013, a comic book series was announced by [[Dark Horse Comics]] that serves as a spin-off to ''Prometheus''. The series, titled ''[[Fire and Stone]]'', is an ''[[Alien vs. Predator]]'' crossover featuring content exclusive to ''Prometheus''. The first issue of ''Fire and Stone'' was released on September 10, 2014.&lt;ref name="ComicFireStone"/&gt;

'''Rolando Bohol''' (born December 25, 1965) is a [[Philippines|Filipino]] former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1984 to 1994. He held the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[flyweight]] title in 1988, and challenged once for the IBF [[bantamweight]] title in 1994.

==Professional career==
Bohol turned professional in 1984 and got a draw on his first match. After 15 matches (13 wins and 2 draws), Bohol lost to Dadoy Andujar by a 10-round decision on September 29, 1985. His first fight outside home soil took place in Sokcho South Korea against Joon Huh on July 20, 1986.

Eleven bouts later, he won the [[International Boxing Federation]] IBF World Flyweight title on January 16, 1988, by defeating Chang Ho Choi in Manila and regained the world title back for the Philippines. Bohol defended the title successfully by defeating Cho-Woon Park by unanimous decision on May 6, 1988. Then, he lost it to Duke McKenzie in London, England on October 5, 1988.

Bohol won the Oriental &amp; Pacific Boxing Federation OPBF Super Flyweight title against Thailand's Maphai Narachavat by a knock-out in 6 rounds. He successfully defended the title by defeating former International Boxing Federation IBF World Fyweight champion Jong-Kwan Chung August 4, 1989. In that same year, he lost the title against Tatsuya Sugi. He would later avenge this loss against Sugi via a tenth round knock-out in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 21, 1994. Aside from boxing Bohol is also an actor. He already appeared in two pictures taking the leading man role in the movies en-titled Kambal na Kamao. After a major car accident in Honolulu, Hawaii, which propelled Rolando's retirement plans quicker than he expected, Bohol moved to Las Vegas in 2006. Rolando Bohol currently owns an Internet electronics store operating from [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], [[United States]], where he resides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rolando Bohol|url=http://rolandobohol.com/biography|publisher=Founder of 24hourshopnet.com |accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abkey worked for [[Radio Mogadishu]]-Voice of Somali Republic in Somalia's [[Mogadishu|capital city]]. He had a long career as a journalist and worked under difficult conditions during the last two decades of his career.

== Career ==

Associates said he turned down suggestions that for security he should live at the radio station and that he refused to be intimidated by the factions fighting in Mogadishu.&lt;ref name = "CPJ"/&gt;

== Death ==
He was abducted by armed hooded men early on the morning of 4 May and then later that day shot to death&lt;ref name = "NUSOJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CPJ"/&gt; near his home in the Wardhigley neighbourhood of the capital.&lt;ref name = "Reuters"/&gt;  The editor of Radio Mogadishu, Abdirahman Yusuf, was quoted as saying, "[[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al Shabaab]] men have killed Sheikh Nur Abkey ... after they killed him, they called us and told us they killed him."&lt;ref name = "Reuters"/&gt; Abdolaziz Mohamed Guled, Radio Magadishu's political correspondent said that Abkey was tortured before he was killed by his kidnappers.&lt;ref name = "Press TV"/&gt; and eyewitnesses stated that Abkey's body was dumped on a Mogadishu street.&lt;ref name = "Press TV"/&gt;

It is believed that Abkey was killed because he was an employee of the government-run Radio Mogadishu, which had been against the extreme insurgents.&lt;ref name = "CPJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "BBC"/&gt;

== Reaction ==
Almost immediately, the International Press Institute condemned Abkey's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seasoned Journalist Killed in Somali Capital / IPI Condemns Brutal Murder of Radio Mogadishu Journalist|url=http://appablog.wordpress.com/2010/05/06/seasoned-journalist-killed-in-somali-capital-ipi-condemns-brutal-murder-of-radio-mogadishu-journalist/|publisher=African Press Organization (International Press Institute)|accessdate=September 19, 2011|date=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in July 2010, [[Amnesty International]] condemned the killing of journalists and called for both the government forces and the armed militias to respect freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journalists under attack in Somalia as government steps up media crackdown|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/journalists-under-attack-somalia-government-steps-media-crackdown-2010-07-22|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=September 19, 2011|date=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Secretary-General of the National Union of Somali Journalists, a partner-organization with [[Reporters Without Borders]], said, "Somali journalists are being murdered just for reporting their stories independently or because they work for a particular news media. The loss of this experienced journalist is heartbreaking for his family and colleagues, but it is also a blow to the entire Somali people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Journalist Slain by Gunmen in Mogadishu|url=http://en.rsf.org/somalie-radio-journalist-slain-by-gunmen-05-05-2010,37392.html|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|accessdate=September 20, 2011|date=May 5, 2010 (Updated May 6)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Irina Bokova]], the director-general of [[UNESCO]], said, "I condemn the murder of Sheikh Nur Abkey. His brutal killing is a heinous crime against a brave journalist and against Somali society as a whole. Nothing good will come to the people of Somalia from those seeking to deprive citizens of the right to know and journalists of the basic human right of freedom of expression..." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Director-General condemns murder of Somali journalist Sheikh Nur Abkey|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=30489&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate=September 19, 2010|date=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shield budding''', also known as '''T-budding''', is a technique of [[grafting]] to change varieties of [[fruit tree]]s. Typically used in [[fruit tree propagation]], it can also be used for many other kinds of [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shield Budding|url=http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/hortcult/treeshru/shildbudg.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extremely sharp knife is necessary; specialty ''budding knives'' are on the market. A budding knife is a small knife with a type of spatula at the other end of the handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=l'Encyclopedie: Budding Knife|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0001.957|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rootstock or stock plant may be cut off above the bud at budding, or one may wait until it is certain that the bud is growing.

Fruit tree budding is done when the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] "slips," i.e. the [[Cambium (botany)|cambium]] is moist and actively growing. Rootstocks are young trees, either seedlings as Mazzard cherries for many [[cherry]] varieties, or clonal rootstocks (usually propagated by layering) when one wants highly consistent plants with well defined characteristics. The popular Malling-Merton series of rootstocks for [[apple]]s was developed in [[England]], and are used today for the majority of the commercial apple orchard trees.

T-budding is the most common style, whereby a T-shaped slit is made in the stock plant, and the knife is flexed from side to side in the lower slit to loosen up the bark. [[Grafting|Scion]] wood is selected from the chosen variety, as young, actively growing shoots. Usually, buds at the tip, or at the older parts of the shoot are discarded, and only two to four buds are taken for use. The buds are in the [[leaf]] axils. They may be so tiny as to be almost unnoticeable.

Holding the petiole of the leaf as a handle, an oval of the main stem is sliced off, including the petiole and the bud. This is immediately slid into the T on the rootstock, before it can dry out. The joined bud and rootstock are held by a winding of rubber band, which will hold it until sealed, but the band will deteriorate in the sunlight so it soon breaks and does not pinch new growth, girdling the shoot.

The percentage of "take" of the buds depends on the natural compatibility of the stock and scion, the sharpness of the knife, and the skill of the budder; even the experts will have some buds die.

== Biography ==
Aadnekvam got his first guitar at the age of 4, and found comfort in playing while growing up in different towns and cities in Norway, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg and Sweden. By the age of 9 he was composing music and listening to artists like [[Elvis Presley]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Michael Jackson]]. As teenager his interest turned to Jazz when discovering artists like Charlie Parker, John McLaughlin, Miles Davis, Rhasaan Roland Kirk, Abdullah Ibrahim and later composers like [[Egberto Gismonti]], [[Hermeto Pascoal]] and [[Indian classical]] music among others.

After musical studies at [[Södra Latins gymnasium]], followed by studies at the [[Royal College of Music, Stockholm]], Sweden, with notable teachers at this time including Mikke Rönnkvist, Thomas Wixtröm, [[Andreas Oberg]], Alvaro Is Rojas and Sten Hostfalt. Aadnekvam turned his curiosity outwards as he decided to travel to [[Mumbai, India]] for studies with classical Indian master flutist [[Hariprasad Chaurasia]] at his intern school Vrindaban Gurukul. Soon after fate would also have him make his first travel to north-eastern Brasil, an acquaintance that made an even deeper impact on him and for almost a decade he now finds his second home in the state of Pernambuco where two of his albums have been recorded collaborating with some of the regions finest musicians.

In 2009 Aadnekvam was nominated for the 'Young Nordic Guitarist Award' by the [[Uppsala International Guitar Festival]],&lt;ref name=kulturalna&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.kulturalna.warszawa.pl/events,1,53334,Steinar_Aadnekvam_Quartet_ndash%3B_concert_within_the_Internat....html?locale=en_GB | title=Steinar Aadnekvam Quartet – concert within the International Jazz in Old Town - Summer Festival | publisher=Kulturalna.Warszawa.pl |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 finalist at the 'Norsk JazzIntro' at [[Moldejazz]]&lt;ref name=ballade&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.ballade.no/sak/atte-band-klare-for-jazzintro | title=Åtte band klare for Jazzintro | language=Norwegian | publisher=Ballade.no | date=2010-01-20 |accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; he started his own record label 'MMYH Records' (Music Makes You Happy) with his debut album ''Simple Things'' (2010).&lt;ref name=jazznytt&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://jazznytt.jazzinorge.no/2011/01/12/steinar-aadnekvam-2 | title=Anmeldelser Steinar Aadnekvam | language=Norwegian | first=Tonje | last=Johansson | publisher=JazzINorge.no | date=2011-01-12 | accessdate=2017-01-08 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110090609/http://jazznytt.jazzinorge.no/2011/01/12/steinar-aadnekvam-2/ | archivedate=2017-01-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years he played feature concerts at clubs and major jazz festivals in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Latvia, Poland and Romania and later turned to working on his two Brazilian album collaborations ''Abacaxeiro'' and 'Ecology' and extensive concert touring, masterclasses, tv appearances and radio broadcasts related to these in the Nordics and in Brasil.&lt;ref name=kulturalna/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="668">In [[embryology]], '''sturt''' is a measure of distance.  On the [[fate map]], the further apart two regions are, the more likely the resulting structures are to form different [[genotype]]s.  A difference of 1% in the ratio of differing genotypes is described as one sturt, after [[Alfred Henry Sturtevant]].

'''Teratology''' is the study of abnormalities of [[physiological development]]. It is often thought of as the study of human [[congenital abnormalities]], but it is broader than that, taking into account other non-birth developmental stages, including [[puberty]]; and other organisms, including plants. The related term [[developmental toxicity]] includes all manifestations of abnormal development that are caused by environmental insult. These may include growth retardation, delayed mental development or other [[congenital disorder]]s without any structural malformations.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, J.M., Kavlock, R.J. (1996). "Developmental toxicology". In C.D. Klaassen (ed.): ''Casarett &amp; Doull's Toxicology'', (5th ed.). pp.&amp;nbsp;301-331. New York: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-105476-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teratogens'''&lt;!--MOS:BOLD - term redirects here--&gt; are substances that may cause [[birth defects]] via a [[toxic]] effect on an embryo or fetus.&lt;ref name="Teratogens"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Thall Bastow BD, Holmes JL|title=Teratology and drug use during pregnancy|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/260725-overview#showall|website=Medscape|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term ''teratology'' stems from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|τέρας}} ''teras'' ([[genitive]] {{lang|grc|τέρατος}} ''teratos''), meaning "monster" or "marvel", and {{lang|grc|λόγος}} ''[[logos]]'', meaning "the word" or, more loosely, "the study of".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=logos |publisher= Etymologyonline.com|accessdate= 8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 17th century, ''teratology'' referred to a discourse on prodigies and marvels of anything so extraordinary as to seem abnormal. In the 19th century it acquired a meaning more closely related to biological deformities, mostly in the field of botany. Currently, its most instrumental meaning is that of the medical study of teratogenesis, [[Congenital disorder|congenital malformations]] or individuals with significant malformations. Historically, people have used many pejorative terms to describe/label cases of significant physical malformations.
In the 1960s [[David Weyhe Smith|David W. Smith]] of the [[University of Washington]] Medical School (one of the researchers who became known in 1973 for the discovery of [[fetal alcohol syndrome]]&lt;ref name=Jonesetal1973&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jones K.L. |author2=Smith D.W |author3=Ulleland C.N. |author4=Streissguth A.P. | year = 1973 | title = Pattern of malformation in offspring of chronic alcoholic mothers | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 7815| pages = 1267–1271 | pmid = 4126070 | doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(73)91291-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;), popularized the term ''teratology''.  With the growth of understanding of the origins of birth defects, the field of teratology {{as of | 2015 | lc = on}} overlaps with other fields of science, including [[developmental biology]], [[embryology]], and [[genetics]].
Until the 1940s teratologists regarded birth defects as primarily hereditary. In 1941 the first well-documented cases of environmental agents being the cause of severe birth defects were reported.{{by whom|date=November 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mammalia==

=== Teratogenesis ===
{{anchor|Wilson's 6 principles}}
Along with this new awareness of the ''[[in utero]]'' vulnerability of the developing [[mammal]]ian [[embryo]] came the development and refinement of ''The Six Principles of Teratology'' which are still applied today. These principles of teratology were put forth by [[James G. Wilson|Jim Wilson]] in 1959 and in his monograph ''Environment and Birth Defects''.&lt;ref name="isbn0-12-757750-5"&gt;{{cite book |author=James G. Wilson |title=Environment and Birth Defects (Environmental Science Series) |publisher=Academic Pr |location=London |year=1973 |pages= |isbn=0-12-757750-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These principles guide the study and understanding of teratogenic agents and their effects on developing organisms:

# Susceptibility to teratogenesis depends on the [[genotype]] of the [[conceptus]] and the manner in which this interacts with adverse environmental factors.
# Susceptibility to teratogenesis varies with the developmental stage at the time of exposure to an adverse influence. There are critical periods of susceptibility to agents and organ systems affected by these agents.
# Teratogenic agents act in specific ways on developing cells and tissues to initiate sequences of abnormal developmental events.
# The access of adverse influences to developing tissues depends on the nature of the influence. Several factors affect the ability of a teratogen to contact a developing conceptus, such as the nature of the agent itself, route and degree of maternal exposure, rate of placental transfer and systemic absorption, and composition of the maternal and embryonic/fetal genotypes.
# There are four manifestations of deviant development (Death, Malformation, Growth Retardation and Functional Defect).
# Manifestations of deviant development increase in frequency and degree as dosage increases from the [[No Observable Adverse Effect Level]] (NOAEL) to a dose producing 100% Lethality (LD100).

Studies designed to test the teratogenic potential of environmental agents use animal model systems (e.g., rat, mouse, rabbit, dog, and monkey). Early teratologists exposed pregnant animals to environmental agents and observed the fetuses for gross visceral and skeletal abnormalities. While this is still part of the teratological evaluation procedures today, the field of Teratology is moving to a more [[molecular]] level, seeking the mechanism(s) of action by which these agents act. [[Genetically modified]] mice are commonly used for this purpose. In addition, pregnancy registries are large, prospective studies that monitor exposures women receive during their pregnancies and record the outcome of their births. These studies provide information about possible risks of medications or other exposures in human pregnancies.

Understanding how a '''teratogen''' causes its effect is not only important in preventing congenital abnormalities but also has the potential for developing new therapeutic drugs safe for use with pregnant women.

===Humans===
{{Main|Congenital disorder}}
In [[human]]s, [[congenital disorder]]s resulted in about 510,000 deaths globally in 2010.&lt;ref name=Loz2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=December 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 3% of newborns have a "major physical anomaly", meaning a physical anomaly that has cosmetic or functional significance.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Abbas and Fausto (eds.), ''Robbins and Cotran's Pathologic Basis of Disease, 7th edition'', p.&amp;nbsp;470.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vaccinating while pregnant====
In [[human]]s, vaccination has become readily available, and is important to the prevention of some diseases like polio, rubella, and smallpox, among others. There has been no association between congenital malformations and vaccination, as shown in Finland in which expecting mothers received the oral polio vaccine and saw no difference in infant outcomes than mothers who had not received the vaccine.&lt;ref name=Harj1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harjulehto-Mervaala|first=T|title=Oral Polio Vaccination during Pregnancy: No Increase in the Occurrence of Congenital Malformations|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=1993|volume=138|issue=6|pages=407–414|pmid= 8213746}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is still not recommended to vaccinate for polio while pregnant unless there is risk of infection &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Vaccinating Pregnant Women|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/hcp/guidelines.html#polio|website=cdc.gov|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)|quote=Although no adverse effects of IPV have been documented among pregnant women or their fetuses, vaccination of pregnant women should be avoided on theoretical grounds. However, if a pregnant woman is at increased risk for infection and requires immediate protection against polio, IPV can be administered in accordance with the recommended schedules for adults.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Another important implication of this includes the ability to get the influenza vaccine while pregnant. During the 1918 and 1957 influenza pandemics, mortality in pregnant women was 45%. However, even with prevention through vaccination, influenza vaccination in pregnant women remains low at 12%. Munoz et al. demonstrated that there was no adverse outcomes observed in the new infants or mothers.&lt;ref name=Mun2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Munoz|first=F|title=Safety of influenza vaccination during pregnancy|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=2005|volume=192|pages=1098–1106|doi= 10.1016/j.ajog.2004.12.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes===
{{Further|Congenital disorder}}
Causes of teratogenesis can broadly be classified as:
*Toxic substances, such as, for humans, [[drugs in pregnancy]] and [[Environmental toxins and fetal development|environmental toxins in pregnancy]].
**[[Potassium iodide]] is a possible '''teratogen'''. [[Potassium iodide]] in its raw form is a mild irritant and should be handled with gloves. Chronic overexposure can have adverse effects on the thyroid.
*[[Vertically transmitted infection]]
*Lack of nutrients. For example, lack of folic acid in the [[nutrition in pregnancy]] for humans can result in [[spina bifida]].
*Physical restraint. An example is [[Potter syndrome]] due to [[oligohydramnios]] in humans.
*[[Genetic disorder]]s
*[[Alcohol and Pregnancy|Alcohol consumption]] during pregnancy.

===Fossil record===
{{Further|Paleopathology}}
Evidence for congenital deformities found in the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists, specialists in ancient disease and injury. Fossils bearing evidence of congenital deformity are scientifically significant because they can help scientists infer the evolutionary history of life's developmental processes. For instance, because a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' specimen has been discovered with a [[block vertebra]], it means that vertebrae have been developing the same basic way since at least the most recent common ancestor of dinosaurs and mammals. Other notable fossil deformities include a hatchling specimen of the bird-like dinosaur, ''[[Troodon]]'', the tip of whose jaw was twisted.&lt;ref name="molnar-pathology"&gt;Molnar, R. E., 2001, Theropod paleopathology: a literature survey: In: Mesozoic  Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University  Press, p. 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Another notably deformed fossil was a specimen of the [[choristodere]] ''[[Hyphalosaurus]]'', which had two heads- the oldest known example of [[polycephaly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ji Q. |author2=Wu X.-C. |author3=Cheng Y.-N. | year = 2010 | title = Cretaceous choristoderan reptiles gave birth to live young | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 97 | issue = 4| pages = 423–428 | doi = 10.1007/s00114-010-0654-2 | pmid=20179895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plantae==
In [[botany]], teratology investigates the theoretical implications of abnormal specimens. For example, the discovery of abnormal flowers—for example, flowers with leaves instead of petals, or flowers with staminoid pistils—furnished important evidence for the "[[ABC model of flower development|foliar theory]]", the theory that all flower parts are highly specialised leaves.

'''''The Myth of Male Power: Why Men are the Disposable Sex''''' is a 1993 book by [[Warren Farrell]], in which Farrell argues that the widespread perception of men having inordinate social and economic power is false, and that men are systematically disadvantaged in many ways.

Like [[Herb Goldberg]]'s ''The Hazards of Being Male'', Farrell's ''The Myth of Male Power'' is considered a standard of the [[men's movement]],&lt;ref name="Clatterbaugh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clatterbaugh|first=Kenneth|year=2000|title=Literature of the U.S. Men's Movements|journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]|volume=25|issue=3|pages=883–94|jstor=3175420|doi=10.1086/495485}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been translated into several languages, including [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].

==Defining male power and powerlessness==
[[File:Wikipedia photo.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Farrell explaining the future of our sons' definition of 'power'.|Farrell explaining the future of our sons' definition of 'power' at the Integral Spiritual Experience World Conference of Spiritual Leaders, 2010.]]
In ''The Myth of Male Power'', Warren Farrell offered his first in-depth outline of the thesis he would eventually apply in his subsequent books—books on communication (''Women Can’t Hear What Men Don’t Say''), parenting (''Father and Child Reunion''), and the workplace (''Why Men Earn More'').
 
As ''The Myth of Male Power's'' title implies, Farrell challenges the belief that men have the power by challenging the definition of power. Farrell defines power as "control over one's life." He writes that, "In the past, neither sex had power; both sexes had roles: women's role was [to] raise children; men's role was [to] raise money."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1993"&gt;Warren Farrell, ''The Myth of Male Power'', (N.Y.: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993), Chp. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One of the examples that Farrell uses to illustrate male powerlessness is male-only [[Selective Service System#Who must register|draft registration]].  He writes that if any other single group (the examples he lists are [[Jews]], [[African-Americans]], and [[women]]) were selected based on their birth characteristics to be the only group required by law to register for potential death, we would call it [[anti-Semitism]], [[racism]] or genocidal [[sexism]]. Men, he says, have been socialized to call it "glory" and "power," and as a result do not view this as a negative.

Farrell contends that this viewpoint creates psychological problems for both sexes: that "men's weakness is their facade of strength; women's strength is their facade of weakness."&lt;ref&gt;Warren Farrell, ''The Myth of Male Power'', (N.Y.: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993), Chapter 2 &amp; 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  He adds that societies have generally socialized boys and men to define power as, in essence, "feeling obligated to earn money someone else spends while we die sooner." Feeling obligated, he contends, is not power.&lt;ref&gt;This critique of Farrell is part of feminist James Sterba's critique of ''The Myth of Male Power'' and ''Why Men Earn More'' in Oxford University Press' book, ''Does Feminism Discriminate Against Men?'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), which is a debate of thirteen gender issues between James Sterba, representing feminist theory, and Warren Farrell, articulating gender transition theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Why Men are the Disposable Sex"===
The subtitle of the book is "Why Men are the Disposable Sex." Farrell argues that historically both sexes were disposable in the service of survival: women risked death in childbirth; men risked death in war. However, Farrell notes, there is a key difference: women's disposability emanated more from biology; [[male expendability|men's expendability]] required socialization.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrell observes various characteristics of modern US society, such as the tendency to assign higher-risk jobs - soldier, firefighter, coal miner, and so on - to men: almost all of the most hazardous professions are all-male, and segments within professions have higher percentages of men as their level of hazard increases. Other statistics, in conjunction with the lack of public outcry or mobilization around them, point in the same direction of male expendability. Men are victims of violent crime twice as often as women and are "three times more likely to be murder victims". Suicide rates are much higher for men than for women. While the death rates for breast cancer and prostate cancer are comparable, the US spends six times as much on breast cancer.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;

These statistics, Farrell suggests, can only be explained if US society places greater value on the lives of women than of men. Todd Jones cites this as an example of [[abductive reasoning]]: rightly or wrongly, Farrell assumes that such behavior is rational, and the only explanation then is that "women are actually perceived as the valuable gender (especially in evolutionary terms) who need to be protected and preserved at all cost, while men (a dime a dozen in evolutionary terms) are thought of as essentially disposable".&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Todd|year=2004|title=Uncovering 'Cultural Meaning': Problems and Solutions|journal=[[Behavior and Philosophy]]|volume=32|issue=2|pages=246–68|jstor=27759484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Where Do We Go From Here?"===

Farrell posits that men and women need to make an evolutionary shift from a focus on survival to a focus on a proper balance between survival and fulfillment.

He claims that the women's movement has led to the re-socialization of girls to become women who balance survival with fulfillment but that there has been no similar re-socialization of boys to become men who pursue that balance once they take on the responsibility of children. Thus, Farrell believes, boys and men are decades behind girls and women psychologically and socially, and increasingly behind women academically and economically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitehouseboystomen.com/blog/?page_id=44, especially Components 1 and 2.]&lt;/ref&gt;
In Farrell's recent presentations on this topic, he estimates that men are in 2011 where women were in 1961.&lt;ref name="warrenfarrell1"&gt;[http://warrenfarrell.com/articles.php?id=81 (text of a presentation from the Dec. 2010 Integral Spiritual Experience).] |dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901232702/http://warrenfarrell.com/articles.php?id=81#&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrell's political solution is "neither a women's movement blaming men nor a men's movement blaming women, but a gender transition movement." He defines a gender transition movement as one that fosters a transition from the rigid roles of our past to more flexible roles for the future.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Farrell, The Myth of Male Power, (N.Y.: Simon and Schuster, 1993), Personal Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Pay Paradox"===
Men, Farrell posits, learn to earn money to gain the approval of their parents and the respect of other men; heterosexual men also learn to earn money to earn their way to female love ("Women don't marry men reading ''Why Men Are the Way They Are'' in the unemployment line.")&lt;ref name="warrenfarrell1"/&gt;

Farrell introduced in ''The Myth of Male Power'' a thesis that he pursued in-depth in ''Why Men Earn More'' in 2005: that earning money involves forfeiting power.  He goes on to describe his theory that earning money is less about power, and more about trade-offs. Farrell proposes that "the road to high pay is a toll road--you earn more when you pay 25 specific tolls such as working more hours, or taking less-fulfilling or more-hazardous jobs..."&lt;ref&gt;''Why Men Earn More'', Dr. Warren Farrell, Part I.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical responses==
Academic [[Kenneth Clatterbaugh]], in an overview of literature of the [[men's movement]], comments that "eventually, [Farrell's] arguments reach absurd heights, as when Farrell actually argues against sexual harassment laws and child molestation laws on the grounds that they give even more power (to abuse men) to (women) employees and children".&lt;ref name="Clatterbaugh"/&gt;

Social critic [[Camille Paglia]], writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', sais ''The Myth of Male Power'' "attacks the unexamined assumptions of feminist discourse with shocking candor and forces us to see our everyday world from a fresh perspective", though she added that Farrell is sometimes guilty of "questionable selectiveness or credulity about historical sources". Paglia nevertheless concludes that the book "is the kind of original, abrasive, heretical text that is desperately needed to restore fairness and balance to the present ideology-sodden curriculum of women's studies courses."&lt;ref name=Paglia&gt;{{cite news|title=Challenging The Masculine Mystique|author=[[Camille Paglia]]|journal=The Washington Post|date=July 25, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewer [[Robert Winder]] describes the book as "shock-horror hyperbole posing as scholarship" and goes on to write "...Farrell might be right to see the gender conflict as a war to which only one side has turned up, but this is only a sarcastic way of confessing to an authentic male worry: the twinge of jealousy men sometimes feel when confronted by feminine solidarity. Farrell, however, just like some of his female opposite numbers, prefers accusation to self-examination".&lt;ref name ="winder"&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert Winder |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/book-review--hapless-underdogs-in-a-bitchy-world-the-myth-of-male-power--warren-farrell-4th-estate-699-1428367.html |title=BOOK REVIEW / Hapless underdogs in a bitchy world: 'The Myth of Male Power' - Warren Farrell: 4th Estate, 6.99 - Voices |publisher=The Independent |date=1994-03-11 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linda Mealey]] notes that the book is recommended reading for educators in the social sciences, particularly gender studies; she does critique Farrell, for easily seeing causality in correlation.&lt;ref name ="mealey"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mealey|first=Linda|year=1995|title=Rev. of Goldberg, ''Why Men Rule''; and Farrell, ''The Myth of Male Power''|journal=[[Politics and the Life Sciences]]|volume=14|issue=2|pages=284–85|jstor=4236163 .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic [[Margot Mifflin]], writes that "most of Farrell’s tit-for-tat theories about man’s greater societal burden are slanted, self-serving, and absurdly simplistic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Margot Mifflin |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20295161,00.html |title=The Myth of Male Power Review &amp;#124; Book Reviews and News |publisher=EW.com |date=1993-08-27 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist [[Melvin Konner]] writes that, like [[Christina Hoff Sommers]]' ''[[Who Stole Feminism?]]'' (1994), ''The Myth of Male Power'' is a good antidote to the way in which "real knowledge about sex roles...tends to get buried in [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] rhetoric."&lt;ref name ="konner"&gt;{{cite book |author=Konner, Melvin |title=The Tangled Wing: Biological Constraints on the Human Spirit |publisher=Times Books |location=New York |year=2002 |page=501 |isbn=0-7167-4602-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Los Angeles Times]] notes that "...some critics say 'The Myth of Male Power' goes beyond the nurturing rituals of the male movement to mount an outright assault on the victories of the modern women's movement."&lt;ref name="WARRICK"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-09/news/vw-22148_1_feminist-warren-farrell|title=A New Role for Men: Victim : Former feminist Warren Farrell says he's sick and tired of guys getting bashed.

An article in [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] notes that the book "...has spawned a network of activists and sites that take Farrell’s ideology in a disturbing direction."&lt;ref name="MJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/warren-farrell-mens-rights-movement-feminism-misogyny-trolls/|title=Mad Men: Inside the Men’s Rights Movement—and the Army of Misogynists and Trolls It Spawned|last=Blake|first=Mariah|date=January 2015|work=motherjones.com|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book includes several factual errors concerning murderer [[Laurie Dann]], who is used as an example of violence against men by women. Farrell states that all of her victims were male, that she burned down a Young Men's Jewish Council, burned two boys in a basement, shot her own son, and alleged that she killed an eight-year old rapist.&lt;ref name ="farrell"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Farrell  | first =Warren  | authorlink =  | title =The Myth of Male Power  | publisher =Berkley Books  | year =1993  | location =New York  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-425-18144-7  | page =216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[men's rights]] activists,&lt;ref name ="equal"&gt;{{cite web  | author = Equal Parents of Canada   | title  = Brief to the Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and Access   | publisher =  | date =1998-03-31  | url =http://pages.interlog.com/~parental/committe/brief.htm#Farrell  | accessdate =2007-02-16  }}&lt;/ref&gt; academics,&lt;ref name ="fekete"&gt;{{cite book  | last  = Fekete  | first = John  | title = Moral Panic:Biopolitics rising  | publisher =Robert Davies Publishing  | year =1994  | location =  | isbn = 978-1-895854-09-1 | pages =31, 339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and media figures have repeated Farrell's errors and conclusion.&lt;ref name ="raeside"&gt;{{cite news  | title =Corrections and Clarifications: Peter Raeside takes a look at the views of 'men's liberationist' Warren Farrell  | work=[[The Globe and Mail]]  | date =1993-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="kay"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Kay  | first =Barbara  | title =The last white ribbon  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =[[National Post]]  | date =2007-12-05  | url=http://www.barbarakay.ca/articles/view/101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrell later issued a correction on his web site.&lt;ref name ="warrenfarrell"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Myth of Male Power|url=http://warrenfarrell.org/Resources/index.html|accessdate=2011-03-22|quote= "While Laurie Dann did go into a boys' bathroom and not a girls' bathroom, and tried to kill the boys for whom she was a babysitter, the Chicago Tribune on May 21, 1988, Section 1, does list two women who were direct victims of Laurie Dann, and a mother who was an indirect victim when she tried to rescue her two sons who had been taken to a basement by Laurie Dann who immediately lit a fire in the basement.

'''Virginia Rappe''' ({{IPAc-en|r|ə|ˈ|p|eɪ}}; July 7, 1895 &amp;ndash; September 9, 1921) was an [[United States|American]] [[Model (person)|model]] and [[silent film]] [[actress]]. She worked mostly in small [[bit parts]], and is best known for her death after attending a party with actor [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle]], who was accused of complicity in her death, though ultimately exonerated.

==Early life and career==
Virginia Caroline Rappe was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] to an unwed mother, Mabel Rappe, who died when Virginia was 11. Virginia was then raised by her grandmother in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Blair|title=American Silent Film Comedies: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Persons, Studios, and Terminology|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|year=1995|page=207|isbn=0-89950-929-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Julie |title=The Mammoth Book of Celebrity Murder: Murder Played Out In The Spotlight Of Maximum Publicity|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2005|page=445|isbn=1-57181-140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 14, she began working as a commercial and [[model (art)|art model]].&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ellis |first=Chris &amp; Julie |title=Celebrity Murder: Murder played out in the spotlight of maximum publicity |publisher=Constable &amp; Robertson|year=2005 |isbn=1-84529-154-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, Rappe relocated to [[San Francisco]] to pursue her career as an artist's model, where she met dress designer Robert Moscovitz, to whom she became engaged. However, shortly after the engagement, Moscovitz was killed in a streetcar accident, whereupon Rappe moved to [[Los Angeles]]. In early 1917, she was hired by director Fred Balshofer and given a prominent role in his film ''Paradise Garden'', opposite popular screen star [[Harold Lockwood]]. Balshofer then hired her again to costar with early [[drag (clothing)|drag]] performer [[Julian Eltinge]] and newcomer [[Rudolph Valentino]] in ''[[The Isle of Love|Over the Rhine]]'', for which she was awarded the title of "Best Dressed Girl in Pictures".&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; This film was not released until 1920, when Balshofer recut it and released it under the title ''An Adventuress'', and later in 1922, after Rappe's death, as ''The Isle of Love''.

In 1919, Rappe began a relationship with director/producer [[Henry Lehrman]]. The two eventually became engaged and lived together, although in the United States Census of 1920, the young actress is listed simply as a "Boarder" in Lehrman's home in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33S7-9R64-QHJ?i=16&amp;cc=1488411 "The Fourteenth Census of the United States: 1920"], City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California, enumeration date January 10, 1920. Retrieved October 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Rappe appeared in at least four films for Lehrman: ''His Musical Sneeze'', ''A Twilight Baby'', ''Punch of the Irish'' and ''A Game Lady''. However, since many of Lehrman's films are lost, the exact number of roles she performed for him cannot be determined.

==Death==
[[File:Virginia-Rappe-Coffin-1921.jpg|thumb|right|Rappe's coffin arrives in Los Angeles, September 17, 1921.]]

The circumstances of Rappe's death in 1921 became a Hollywood scandal and were covered widely (and sensationalized) by the media of the time. During a party held on [[Labor Day]], September 5, 1921, in [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle]]'s suite, number 1219, at the [[St. Francis Hotel]] in San Francisco, Rappe allegedly suffered a trauma. She died on September 9 from a ruptured [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] and secondary [[peritonitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meade|first=Marion |title=Buster Keaton: Cut To the Chase|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1997|page=121|isbn=0-306-80802-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried at [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=Kristan|author2=Rufus, Anneli |title=California Babylon|publisher=Macmillan|year=2000|page=46|isbn=0-312-26385-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumors arose, supposedly to besmirch her character, that Rappe had given birth to a child in Chicago in 1918, and that the child was given to foster care. These rumors were proven false by [[autopsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SN19211112.2.31|title=Sausalito News 12 November 1921 — California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Virginia Rappe Grave.JPG|thumb|200px|Grave of Virginia Rappe at Hollywood Forever Cemetery]]

The exact events of that party are still unclear, with witnesses relating numerous versions of what happened. It was alleged that Rappe had died as a result of a violent [[sexual assault]] by Arbuckle. Arbuckle's accuser, Bambina Maude Delmont, had accompanied Rappe to the party; she had first met Rappe only a few days earlier.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|title=Go West, Young Women! |first=Hilary |last=Hallett |publisher=University of California Press |date=2013 |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Delmont was a notorious character with an extensive police record for extortion, prostitution and blackmail.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fatty Arbuckle and the Death of Virginia Rappe | url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/fatty_arbuckle/3.html |first=Denise |last=Noe |publisher=crimelibrary.com |accessdate=13 July 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210000102/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/classics/fatty_arbuckle/3.html|archivedate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent witnesses testified that Rappe had for some time suffered from [[cystitis]], and that consuming alcohol could aggravate that condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pPwJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3jEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6543,1247471&amp;dq=virginia+rappe&amp;hl=en|work=Ludington Daily News|date=September 13, 1921|title=Virginia Blamed Lover, says nurse|location=San Francisco, Cal.|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses also testified that she had previously suffered from [[venereal disease]], so there were allegations that her death was brought on by her health rather than by an assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fatty Arbuckle and the Death of Virginia Rappe | url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/fatty_arbuckle/3.html |first=Denise |last=Noe |publisher=crimelibrary.com |accessdate=13 July 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210000102/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/classics/fatty_arbuckle/3.html|archivedate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three [[manslaughter]] trials, Arbuckle was formally [[acquittal|acquitted]]; his acquittal in the third trial was accompanied by an unprecedented statement of apology from the jury stating, in part, that, "Acquittal is not enough for Roscoe Arbuckle. We feel that a great injustice has been done him&amp;hellip; there was not the slightest proof adduced to connect him in any way with the commission of a crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chermak|first=Steven M. |author2=Bailey, Frankie Y. |title=Crimes and Trials of the Century|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|page=67|isbn=0-313-34110-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Arbuckle's reputation and career were  ruined because of the scandal.

The case has been examined by scholars and historians over the years and is still speculated about today, and a number of detailed books about the case have analyzed the incident and subsequent trials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22379">'''Visual agnosia''' is an impairment in recognition of visually presented objects. It is not due to a deficit in vision (acuity, visual field, and scanning), language, memory, or intellect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Delver, J. F., Seton, X., Colette, F., &amp; Ross ion | year = 2004 | title = Evidence for Perceptual Deficits in Associative Visual (Pro sop)agnosia: A Single-case Study | journal = Parapsychologist | volume = 42 | issue = 5| pages = 597–612 | doi =  10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2003.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[cortical blindness]] results from lesions to primary visual cortex, visual agnosia is often due to damage to more anterior cortex such as the posterior [[Occipital lobe|occipital]] and/or [[temporal lobe]](s) in the brain.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; There are two types of visual agnosia: apperceptive agnosia and associative agnosia.

Recognition of visual objects occurs at two primary levels. At an apperceptive level, the features of the visual information from the retina are put together to form a perceptual representation of an object. At an associative level, the meaning of an object is attached to the perceptual representation and the object is identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Riddoch, M. J., Humphreys, G. W. | year = 1987 | title = A Case of Integrative Visual Agnosia | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 110 | issue = 6| pages = 1431–1462 | doi =  10.1093/brain/110.6.1431}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person is unable to recognize objects because they cannot perceive correct forms of the objects, although their knowledge of the objects is intact (i.e. they do not have [[Anomic aphasia|anomia]]), they have apperceptive agnosia. If a person correctly perceives the forms and has knowledge of the objects, but cannot identify the objects, they have associative agnosia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Karnath H. O. |author2=Rüter J. |author3=Mandler A. |author4=Himmelbach M. | year = 2009 | title = The anatomy of object recognition—Visual form agnosia caused by medial occipitotemporal stroke | url = | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 29 | issue = 18| pages = 5854–5862 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5192-08.2009 | pmid=19420252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==

While most cases of visual agnosia are seen in older adults who have experienced extensive brain damage, there are also cases of young children with less brain damage during developmental years acquiring the symptoms.&lt;ref name=Funnel&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17470218.2010.498922 |pmid=20680887 |title=Development of a vocabulary of object shapes in a child with a very-early-acquired visual agnosia: A unique case |journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=261–282 |year=2011 |last1=Funnell |first1=Elaine |last2=Wilding |first2=John }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, visual agnosia presents as an inability to recognize an object in the absence of other explanations, such as blindness or partial blindness, anomia, memory loss, etc.. Other common manifestations of visual agnosia that are generally tested for include difficulty identifying objects that look similar in shape, difficulty with identifying line drawings of objects, and recognizing objects that are shown from less common views, such as a horse from a top-down view.&lt;ref name=Funnel /&gt;

Within any given patient, a variety of symptoms can occur, and the impairment of ability is not only binary but can range in severity. For example, Patient SM is a prosopagnosic with a unilateral lesion to left extrastriate cortex due to an accident in his twenties who displays behavior similar to congenital prosopagnosia.&lt;ref name=BehrmannKimchi&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0096-1523.29.1.19 |title=What does visual agnosia tell us about perceptual organization and its relationship to object perception? |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance |volume=29 |pages=19–42 |year=2003 |last1=Behrmann |first1=Marlene |last2=Kimchi |first2=Ruth |url=http://repository.cmu.edu/psychology/131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he can recognize facial features and emotions – indeed he sometimes uses a standout feature to recognize a face – face recognition is almost impossible purely from visual stimuli, even for faces of friends, family, and himself. The disorder also affects his memory of faces, both in storing new memories of faces and recalling stored memories.&lt;ref name=BehrmannKimchi/&gt;

Nevertheless, it is important to note the reach of symptoms to other domains. SM’s object recognition is similarly impaired though not entirely; when given line drawings to identify, he was able to give names of objects with properties similar to the drawing, implying that he is able to see the features of the drawing.  Similarly, copying a line drawing of a beach scene led to a simplified version of the drawing, though the main features were accounted for. For recognition of places, he is still impaired but familiar places are remembered and new places can be stored into memory.&lt;ref name=BehrmannKimchi/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Visual agnosia occurs after damage to visual association cortex or to parts of the ventral stream of vision, known as the "what pathway" of vision for its role in object recognition.&lt;ref name="Carlson, 2010"&gt;{{cite book |author=Carlson, Neil R. |title=Physiology of behavior |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon |location=Boston, Mass |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=978-0-205-66627-0 |oclc=263605380 |doi= |accessdate=}}{{pn|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This occurs even when no damage has been done to the eyes or optic tract that leads visual information into the brain; in fact, visual agnosia occurs when symptoms cannot be explained by such damage. Damage to specific areas of the ventral stream impair the ability to recognize certain categories of visual information, such as the case of prospagnosia.&lt;ref name="Carlson, 2010" /&gt;  Patients with visual agnosia generally do not have damage to the dorsal stream of vision, known as the "where pathway" of vision because of its role determining object's position in space, allowing individuals with visual agnosia to show relatively normal visually guided behavior.&lt;ref name="Goodale1991"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goodale MA, Milner AD, Jakobson LS, Carey DP |title=A neurological dissociation between perceiving objects and grasping them |journal=Nature |volume=349 |issue=6305 |pages=154–6 |year=1991 |pmid=1986306 |doi=10.1038/349154a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodale1992"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goodale MA, Milner AD |title=Separate visual pathways for perception and action |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=20–5 |year=1992 |pmid=1374953 |doi=10.1016/0166-2236(92)90344-8|citeseerx=10.1.1.207.6873 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, patient DF had lesions to the ventral surface that gave her apperceptive agnosia.&lt;ref name="Kolb, B. 2009" /&gt; One of the tasks she was tested on required her to place a card through a thin slot that could be rotated into all orientations. As an apperceptive agnosic, it would be expected that since she cannot recognize the slot, she should not be able to correctly place the card into the slot. Indeed, when she was asked to give the direction of the slot, her responses were no better than chance. Yet, when she was asked to place the card into the slot, her success was almost to the level of the controls. This implies that in the event of a ventral stream deficit, the dorsal stream can help with processing of special information to aid movement regardless of object recognition.&lt;ref name="Kolb, B. 2009" /&gt;

More specifically, the lateral occipital complex appears to respond to many different types of objects.&lt;ref name="Carlson, 2010" /&gt;  Prosopagnosia (inability to recognize faces) is due to damage of the fusiform face area (FFA). An area in the fusiform gyrus of the temporal lobe that has been strongly associated with a role in facial recognition.&lt;ref name="Carlson, 2010" /&gt;  However, this area is not exclusive to faces; recognition of other objects of expertise are also processed in this area. The extrastriate body cortex (EBA) was found to be activated by photographs, silhouettes, or stick drawings of human bodies.&lt;ref name="Carlson, 2010" /&gt;  The parahippocampal place area (PPA) of the limbic cortex has been found to be activated by the sight of scenes and backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Carlson, 2010" /&gt;  Cerebral achromatopsia (the inability to discriminate between different hues) is caused by damage to the V8 area of the visual association cortex.&lt;ref name="Carlson, 2010" /&gt;

The left hemisphere seems to play a critical role in recognizing the meaning of common objects.&lt;ref name=pmid3794729&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.49.11.1233 |pmid=3794729 |pmc=1029070 |title=Visual associative agnosia: A clinico-anatomical study of a single case |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=49 |issue=11 |pages=1233–40 |year=1986 |last1=McCarthy |first1=R. A. |last2=Warrington |first2=E. K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
=== Classification ===

Broadly, visual agnosia is divided into apperceptive and associative visual agnosia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/wcs.42 |pmid=26271235 |title=Agnosias |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=203–213 |year=2010 |last1=Behrmann |first1=Marlene |last2=Nishimura |first2=Mayu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apperceptive agnosia is failure of object recognition even when the basic visual functions (acuity, color, motion) and other mental processing, such as language and intelligence, are normal.&lt;ref name="Kolb, B. 2009"&gt;Kolb, B. &amp; Whishaw, I. Q. (2009). "Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology 6th ed.'' New York, NY., [[Worth Publishers]]. {{ISBN|978-0-7167-9586-5}}.{{pn|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain must correctly integrate features such as edges, light intensity, and color from sensory information to form a complete percept of an object. If a failure occurs during this process, a percept of an object is not fully formed and thus it cannot be recognized.&lt;ref name="Heilman, K. M. 2002"&gt;Heilman, K. M. (2002). "Matter of Mind.'' New York, NY., [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-19-514490-1}}.{{pn|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tasks requiring copying, matching, or drawing simple figures can distinguish the individuals with apperceptive agnosia because they cannot perform such tasks.

Associative agnosia is an inability to identify objects even with apparent perception and knowledge of them. It involves a higher level of processing than apperceptive agnosia.&lt;ref name="Kolb, B. 2009"/&gt; Individuals with associative agnosia can copy or match simple figures, indicating that they can perceive objects correctly. They also display the knowledge of objects when tested with tactile or verbal information. However, when tested visually, they cannot name or describe common objects.&lt;ref name="Heilman, K. M. 2002"/&gt; This means that there is an impairment in associating the perception of objects with the stored knowledge of them.

Although visual agnosia can be general, there exist many variants that impair recognition of specific types. These variants of visual agnosia include prosopagnosia (inability to recognize faces), pure word blindness (inability to recognize words, often called "agnosic alexia" or "pure alexia"), agnosias for colors (inability to differentiate colors), agnosias for the environment (inability to recognize landmarks or difficult with spatial layout of an environment, i.e. topographagnosia) and simultanagosia (inability to sort out multiple objects in a visual scene).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11910-003-0055-4 |title=Visual agnosia |journal=Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=508–512 |year=2003 |last1=Biran |first1=I. |last2=Coslett |first2=H. B. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/wco.0b013e328341a5c2 |pmid=21102334 |title=Disorder of higher visual function |journal=Current Opinion in Neurology |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |year=2011 |last1=Barton |first1=Jason JS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Categories and subtypes of visual agnosia ====

The two main categories of visual agnosia are:
* [[Apperceptive agnosia|Apperceptive visual agnosia]], impaired object recognition. Individuals with apperceptive visual agnosia cannot form a whole percept of visual information.&lt;ref name="Ferreira,1998"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.65.3.382 |title=Separate visual pathways for perception of actions and objects: Evidence from a case of apperceptive agnosia |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=382–385 |year=1998 |last1=Ferreira |first1=C. T. |last2=Ceccaldi |first2=M. |last3=Giusiano |first3=B. |last4=Poncet |first4=M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Associative visual agnosia]], impaired object identification. Individuals with associative agnosia cannot give a meaning to a formed percept. The percept is created, but it would have no meaning for individuals who have an associative agnosia.&lt;ref name="Ferreira,1998"/&gt;

=====Subtypes of Associative Visual Agnosia=====
*[[Achromatopsia]], an inability to distinguish different [[color]]s.&lt;ref name="Kolb, B. 2009"/&gt;
*[[Prosopagnosia]], an inability to recognize human faces.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Jeremy (2012). "Sensation &amp; Perception" 3rd ed.'' pp. 507 {{ISBN|978-0-87893-876-6}}.{{pn|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with prosopagnosia know that they are looking at faces, but cannot recognize people by the sight of their face, even people whom they know well.&lt;ref name="Carlson, 2010"/&gt;
*Simultagnosia, an inability to recognize multiple objects in a scene, including distinct objects within a spatial layout and distinguishing between “local” objects and “global” objects, such as being able to see a tree but not the forest or vice versa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Topographagnosia, an inability to process the spatial layout of an environment, including landmark agnosia, difficult recognizing buildings and places; difficulty building mental maps of a location or scene; and/or an inability to discern the orientation between objects in space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Pure Alexia, an inability to read.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Orientation Agnosia: an inability to judge or determine orientation of objects.&lt;ref name=pmid11564324&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/08989290152541467 |pmid=11564324 |title=Object Orientation Agnosia: A Failure to Find the Axis? |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=800–812 |year=2001 |last1=Harris |first1=Irina M. |last2=Harris |first2=Justin A. |last3=Caine |first3=Diana }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pantomime Agnosia: an inability to understand pantomimes (gestures). It appears that the inferior cortical visual cortex is critical in recognizing pantomimes.&lt;ref name=pmid3701356&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.49.4.451 |pmid=3701356 |pmc=1028777 |title=Pantomime agnosia |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=451–4 |year=1986 |last1=Rothi |first1=L. J. |last2=Mack |first2=L. |last3=Heilman |first3=K. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patient CK==

===Background===
Patient C.K. was born in 1961 in England and emigrated to Canada in 1980. In January of 1988, C.K. sustained a head injury from a motor vehicle accident while out for a jog. Following the accident, C.K. experienced many cognitive issues, mood swings, poor memory, and temper outbursts. C.K. also had motor weakness on the left side and a left homonymous hemianopia. He recovered well, retaining normal intelligence and normal visual acuity. He was able to complete a Masters in History, later working as a manager at a large corporation. Although his recovery was successful in other areas of cognition, C.K. still struggles to make sense of the visual world.&lt;ref name=pmid7964528&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7964528 |year=1994 |last1=Behrmann |first1=M. |title=Intact visual imagery and impaired visual perception in a patient with visual agnosia |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology. Human Perception and Performance |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=1068–87 |last2=Moscovitch |first2=M. |last3=Winocur |first3=G. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Associative Visual Agnosia===
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed bilateral thinning of C.K.’s Occipital Lobe which resulted in associative visual agnosia.&lt;ref name=pmid7964528/&gt; Patients that suffer from visual agnosia are unable to identify visually presented objects. They can identify these objects through other modalities such as touch but if presented visually, they are unable to. Associative Agnosic patients cannot create a detailed representation of the visual world in their brains, they can only perceive elements of whole objects.&lt;ref name=pmid7964528/&gt; They also cannot form associations between objects or assign meaning to objects.&lt;ref name=pmid23965118&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23965118 |year=1997 |last1=Moscovitch |first1=M. |title=What is Special about Face Recognition? Nineteen Experiments on a Person with Visual Object Agnosia and Dyslexia but Normal Face Recognition |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=555–604 |last2=Winocur |first2=G. |last3=Behrmann |first3=M. |doi=10.1162/jocn.1997.9.5.555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

C.K. makes many mistakes when trying to identify objects. For example, he called an abacus “skewers on a kebab” and a badminton racquet a “fencer’s mask”. A dart was a “feather duster” and a protractor was mistaken for a “cockpit”. Despite this impairment in visual object recognition, C.K. retained many abilities such as drawing, visual imagery, and internal imagery. As a native of England, he was tasked with drawing England, marking London and where he was born. His accurate drawing of England is just one example of his excellent drawing abilities.&lt;ref name=pmid7964528/&gt;
 
As aforementioned, C.K. is able to identify parts of objects but cannot generate a whole representation. It should not be surprising then that his visual imagery for object size, shape, and color is intact. For example, when shown a picture of an animal, he can correctly answer questions such as “are the ears up or down?” and “is the tail long or short?” He can correctly identify colors, for example that the inside of a cantaloupe is orange.&lt;ref name=pmid7964528/&gt; Finally, C.K. can generate internal images and perceive these generated objects. For example, Finke, Pinker, and Farah instructed C.K. to imagine a scenario where a ‘B’ is rotated 90 degrees to the left, a triangle is put below, and the line in the middle is removed. C.K. can correctly identify this object as a heart by picturing this transformation in his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0364-0213(89)90011-6 |title=Reinterpreting visual patterns in mental imagery |journal=Cognitive Science |volume=13 |pages=51–78 |year=1989 |last1=Finks |first1=R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Evidence for Double Dissociation between Face and Object Processing===
Patient C.K. provided evidence for a double dissociation between face processing and visual object processing. Patients with prosopagnosia have damage to the Fusiform Face Area (FFA) and are unable to recognize upright faces. C.K. has no difficulty with face processing and matches the performance of controls when tasked with identifying upright famous faces. When shown inverted faces of famous people, C.K. performs significantly worse than controls. This is because processing inverted faces involves a piecemeal strategy. C.K.’s performance is compared to patients with prosopagnosia who are impaired in face processing but perform well identifying inverted faces. This was the first evidence for a double dissociation between face and object processing suggesting a face-specific processing system.&lt;ref name=pmid23965118/&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* A famous report on this condition is the title essay of [[Oliver Sacks]]' book, ''[[The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat]]''.
* The murder suspect in the ''[[Picket Fences]]'' episode "Strangers" supposedly suffered from agnosia.
* The patient in the ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' episode "[[Adverse Events]]" suffered from agnosia.
* In the graphic novel ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'', the character Lorie suffers from an extreme version of agnosia resulting from being born with a single eye. For example, she perceives Arseface, a man with severe facial deformities, as resembling a young [[James Dean]]. 
* Val Kilmer's character suffers from visual agnosia in the film ''[[At First Sight (1999 film)|At First Sight]]''.
* In "Folie à Deux", a fifth-season episode of [[the X Files]], Mulder succumbs to the same belief as telemarketer Gary Lambert, that his boss Greg Pincus is a monster who disguises his true appearance by means of [[hypnosis]]. Scully, although believing this notion preposterous, suggests that what Mulder describes is analogous to an induced visual agnosia.
