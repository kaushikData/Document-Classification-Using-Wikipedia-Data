'''''A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language: Arranged According to the Wu-Fang Yuen Yin, with the Pronunciation of the Characters as Heard in Peking, Canton, Amoy, and Shanghai''''' or the '''''Hàn-Yīng yùnfǔ 漢英韻府''''' (1874), compiled by the American sinologist and missionary [[Samuel Wells Williams]], is a 1,150-page [[bilingual dictionary]] including 10,940 character [[headword]] entries, alphabetically [[collation|collated]] under 522 [[Syllable#Chinese model|syllables]].  Williams' dictionary includes, in addition to Mandarin, Chinese variants from [[Middle Chinese]] and four regional [[varieties of Chinese]], according to the 17th-century ''Wufang yuanyin'' 五方元音 "Proto-sounds of Speech in All Directions".

==Title==
The lengthy English title ''A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language: Arranged According to the Wu-Fang Yuen Yin, with the Pronunciation of the Characters as Heard in Peking, Canton, Amoy, and Shanghai'' refers to the influential [[rime dictionary]] of Chinese varieties compiled by Fan Tengfeng 樊騰鳳 (1601-1664), the ''Wufang yuanyin'' 五方元音 "Proto-sounds of Speech in All Directions" (Yong and Peng 2008: 358-359). A Chinese rime dictionary (as differentiated from a [[rhyming dictionary]]) collates characters according to the [[phonology|phonological]] model of a [[rime table]], arranged by [[Mandarin Chinese#Initials|initials]], [[Mandarin Chinese#Finals|finals]], and the classical [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]] of [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciation.

The Chinese title ''Hàn-Yīng yùnfǔ 漢英韻府'' (lit. "Chinese-English Rime Dictionary") combines two words that commonly occur in dictionary titles. ''Hàn-Yīng'' 漢英 means "Chinese-English" and ''yùnfǔ'' 韻府 (lit. "rime storehouse") means "rime dictionary". For example, the [[Yuan dynasty]] (c. 1280) ''Yunfu qunyu'' 韻府群玉 "Assembled Jade-tablets Rime Dictionary" compiled by Yin Shifu 陰時夫, the [[Qing dynasty]] (1711) ''[[Peiwen yunfu]]'', and especially Morrison's ''A Dictionary of the Chinese Language'' Part II or ''Wuche yunfu'' 五車韻府 "Erudite Rime Dictionary".

[[File:Portraits from Hibata Osuke’s 1854 sketches - translator S. Wells Williams - Sanada Treasure Museum - DSC09560.JPG|thumb|[[Woodblock printing in Japan|Woodblock]] caricature of Samuel Wells Williams by the Japanese artist Hibata Ōsuke 樋畑翁輔,1854]]
Samuel Wells Williams (1812-1884), known as Wèi Sānwèi 衛三畏 in Chinese ([[Wei (surname)#Notable people surnamed Wei .28.E8.A1.9B.2F.E5.8D.AB.29|Wei 衛]] is a surname), was an American [[missionary]], [[diplomat]], and [[Sinology|sinologist]]. In 1833, the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions#ABCFM in China|American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] sent Williams to manage their printing press of at Canton (present-day [[Guangzhou]]) China. After a productive 40 years spent in China, Williams returned to the United States in 1877 and became the first Professor of Chinese language and literature at [[Yale University]].

Williams was a prolific writer, translator, lexicographer, and editor. For English-speaking students of [[Chinese as a foreign language]], he wrote (1842) ''Easy Lessons in Chinese: or Progressive Exercises to Facilitate the Study of that Language''. Prior to compiling ''A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language'', he published two specialized dictionaries. The (1844) ''An English and Chinese Vocabulary in the Court Dialect'', or '' Ying Hwá Yun-fú Lih-kiái'' 英華韻府歷階 "English-Chinese Mandarin Rime Dictionary", was intended to replace Morrison's (1828) ''Vocabulary of the Canton Dialect: Chinese Words and Phrases'', which was out-of-print. "Court Dialect" refers to ''guānhuà'' 官話 (lit. "official speech") or the [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|late imperial Mandarin]] [[Koiné language|koiné]] spoken in Beijing. Williams' (1856) ''A Tonic Dictionary of the Chinese Language in the Canton Dialect'' or ''ˌYing ˌWá ˌFan Wanˈ Ts'ütˌ Lúˈ'' 英華分韻提要 ("English-Chinese Summary of Tonal Divisions") includes 7,850 characters commonly used in [[Cantonese]] (Yong &amp; Peng 2008: 388).

Samuel Williams spent 11 years compiling ''A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language''. The dictionary preface (1874: v) explains that he first planned to rearrange ''A Tonic Dictionary of the Chinese Language in the Canton Dialect'' and "fit it for general use" but he soon realized that its "incompleteness required an entire revision". Williams began compilation in 1863, when he was [[chargé d'affaires]] for the United States in Beijing, and after realizing that foreigners required more than a wordlist of common Chinese terms, he decided to produce a successor to Morrison's dictionary (Williams 1889: 346).

Sources that Williams consulted include Part II of Morrison's dictionary, Gonçalves' (1833) ''Diccionario China-Portuguez'', De Guignes' (1813) ''Dictionnaire Chinois'', and his ''A Tonic Dictionary'' of Cantonese. Although he said, "Dr. Medhurst's translation of the K'anghi Tsz'tien" has been much used", the principal source for definitions was the original ''Kangxi zidian'', which "imperfect as it is according to our ideas of a lexicon, is still the most convenient work of the kind in the language" (1974: vi). The explanations of character origins ("etymological definitions") are taken from Sha Mu's 沙木 (1787) ''Yiwen beilan'' 藝文備覽 "Literary Writings for Consultance".

Samuel Williams describes the ideal Chinese bilingual dictionary.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The plan of a Chinese lexicon to satisfy all the needs of a foreigner, should comprise the general and vernacular pronunciations, with the tones used in various places, and the sounds given to each character as its meanings vary. The history and composition of the character, its uses in various epochs, and its authorized and colloquial meanings should be explained and illustrated by suitable examples. All this knowledge should be methodically arranged so as to be accessible with the least possible trouble. But even when arranged and ready, the foreigner would find it to be incomplete for all his purposes by reason of the local usages, ... (1874: vii) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Yong and Peng (2008: 387) interpret this desideratum as Williams' explanation for including regional pronunciation variants in ''A Syllabic Dictionary'', and say, "As good as his intention was, it was highly doubtful whether he could achieve his goal."

In an 1865 letter to his son, Williams compares working on the dictionary with his camel ride from Cairo to Gaza, a "monotonous travel through a dreary sameness, relieved by a few shrubs, and sometimes a flower", and says he finds Chinese literature so "destitute of imagination" that "making a dictionary to elucidate it is indeed a drudgery" (Williams 1889: 360).

In November 1871, Williams traveled to Shanghai to oversee printing of the dictionary, and returned intermittently until publication in 1874 (Williams 1889: 390). After thieves stole 250 [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype printing]] plates of the dictionary from the Mission House in 1879, Williams made corrections and additions for the revised pages, which were used in a new 1881 edition (Williams 1889: 440). The American Presbyterian Mission Press continued to reprint Williams' original ''A Syllabic Dictionary'' for 30 years up until 1903.

In 1909, a revised edition that replaced Williams' romanization system with standard [[Wade-Giles]] was published: ''A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language Arranged According to the Wu-Fang Yüan Yin. By S. Wells Williams, LL. D., and Alphabetically Rearranged According to the Romanization of Sir Thomas F. Wade, by a Committee of the North China Mission of the American Board''.

In the history of bilingual Chinese lexicography, Williams' ''A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language'' was published 51 years after [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]]'s 4,595-page ''[[A Dictionary of the Chinese Language]]'' and 32 years after [[Walter Henry Medhurst]]'s 1,486-page ''[[Chinese and English Dictionary]]''. Williams adapted and incorporated from both dictionaries. Williams' 10,940 Chinese character head entries compare with the 12,674 numbered entries in Part II of Morrison's (1815-1823) ''A Dictionary of the Chinese Language, in Three Parts'', which is likewise collated alphabetically by pronunciation of 411 syllables, and with the approximately 12,000 head entries in Medhurst's (1842) ''Chinese and English Dictionary: Containing All the Words in the Chinese Imperial Dictionary, Arranged According to the Radicals''.

[[File:Williams Syllabic 1896 867.jpg|thumb|Sample page from Williams' ''Syllabic Dictionary'' (1896: 867)]]
The 1150-page ''Syllabic Dictionary'' is preceded by the front matter with a 6-page preface and an 84-page introduction. The latter introduces the ''Wufang yuanyin'', orthography, aspiration, tones, Middle Chinese ("Old Sounds") pronunciations, the range of regional Chinese varieties, a table with 8 regional pronunciations of an extract from the (1724) ''[[Sacred Edict of the Kangxi Emperor]]'', a table of the 214 [[Kangxi radicals]], and a table of 1040 character phonetics ("primitives"), for example (1874: lxii), [''zhōng''] 中 "middle", [''shǎo''] 少 "few", and [''zhù''] 宁 "vestibule".

Williams' preface to ''A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language '' explains, "The number of characters in this work is 12,527, contained in 10,940 articles, and placed under 522 syllables, which follow each other alphabetically, aspirated syllables coming after the unaspirated. Those syllables which begin with ''ts'', on account of their number, are placed by themselves after ''tw'an''" (1874: ix). The additional 1,587 characters are differently written [[Variant Chinese character|variant characters]]. For instance, the standard character [[wikt:醫|醫]] for ''yī'' "medical doctor" has [[wikt:酉|酉]] "wine vessel" indicating medicinal wine, but the earlier variant character [[wikt:毉|毉]] has [[wikt:巫|巫]] "[[Wu (shaman)|Chinese shaman]]" indicating shamanic healing.

Rime dictionaries are arranged in terms of the classical [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]] of [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciation: ''píng'' 平 "level" tone, ''shǎng'' 上 "rising" tone, ''qù'' 去 "departing" tone, and ''rù'' 入 "entering" tone. Most western-language dictionaries of Chinese represent tones by marking vowels with diacritics, Morrison's dictionary, for instance, indicates "level" tone as unmarked (''a''), "rising" with [[grave accent]] (''à''), "departing" with [[acute accent]] (''á''), and "entering" tone with "short accent" (''ǎ''). As a result of using 17th-century ''Wufang yuanyin'' pronunciations, early Chinese-English dictionaries were much concerned with the "entering" tone, which had already ceased to exist in 19th-century Beijing pronunciation (Norman 1988: 173).

Williams' dictionary represents the four tones in the same uncommon method as his (1842) ''Easy Lessons in Chinese'': semicircles written in one of the four corners of a character (the linguistic term ''fāngkuàizì'' 方塊字, lit. "square character", means "Chinese character; square print") or pronunciation. He explains that Chinese schoolmasters mark the tone of every character in their students' printed books in order to facilitate reading aloud; with a semicircle in the character's lower left corner for "level" tone, in the upper left for "rising", in the upper right for "departing", and in the lower right for "entering" tone.

The head entry format in Williams' dictionary is the [[regular script]] character over the Peking Mandarin pronunciation (and an empty space "if one wishes to write the local sound beside the Pekingese"), both character and pronunciation are marked with a corner semicircle to indicate tone, an explanation of the character's origin, English translation equivalents, and usage examples (totaling about 53,000, 1874: ix).

The Chinese character [[wikt:道|道]] for ''dào'' "way; path; say; the [[Tao|Dao]]" or ''dǎo'' "guide; lead; conduct; instruct; direct" (or [[wikt:導|導]] clarified with [[Radical 41]] 寸 "thumb; inch") is a good litmus test for a dictionary because it has two pronunciations and complex semantics. Williams dictionary sample entry '''道ʼ''' (1874: 867, shown to the right) gives the [[regular script]] character over the ''taoʼ'' pronunciation gloss (both marked with a semicircle to the upper right indicating ''qù'' 去 "departing" tone), explanation of character origin, English translation equivalents, and usage examples.

The dictionary's phonological section headings are according to standard [[Beijing dialect]] pronunciation, and note variant ones from [[Middle Chinese]] ("Old sounds") and four regional [[varieties of Chinese]] spoken in [[Treaty ports]] where Protestant missionaries were active. "Swatow" or [[Shantou]] in [[Guangdong province]] refers to [[Shantou dialect]], a [[Southern Min]] variety, "Amoy" or [[Xiamen]] in [[Fujian province]] to [[Amoy dialect]], another [[Southern Min]] variety, also in Fujian province, "Fuchau" or [[Fuzhou]] refers to [[Fuzhou dialect]], the prestige form of [[Eastern Min]], and "[[Shanghai]]" to [[Shanghainese]], a variety of [[Wu Chinese]]. Thus, the '''TAO''' heading (1874: 865) says, "''Old sounds'', to, do, tot, ''and'' dok. ''In Canton'', tò; – ''in Swatow'', to ''and'' tau; – ''in Amoy'', tò ''and'' tiau; – ''in Fuchau'', to ''and'' t'o; – ''in Shanghai'', to ''and'' do; – ''in Chifu'', tao."

The [[logographic]] explanation of 道 (which combines [[Radical 162]] 辵 or 辶 "walk; go" and [[Radical 181]] 首 "head"; [[stroke order]] is animated [[wikt:道#Etymology|here]]) says, "From ''to go'' and the ''head''; q. d. being at the head"; and "occurs used with the next and last" refers to the subsequent two [[Variant Chinese character|variant character]] entries, [[wikt:衜|衜]] with [[Radical 144]] 行 "go" instead of Radical 162 "From ''to walk'' and a ''head''; interchanged with the preceding", and 導 with Radical 41 "From an ''inch'' and ''road''".

The 24 English translation equivalents include both common ''dào'' meanings and specialized ones in [[Chinese geography]], [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Chinese Buddhism]], [[Daoism]] (calling Daoists "Rationalists"), and [[Chinese grammar]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;A road, path, or way; in ''geography'', a zone or belt; in ''medicine'', anal and urinal passages; a circuit; the officer who oversees a circuit or region; a principle, a doctrine, that which the mind approves; and used in the classics in the sense of the right path in which one ought to go, either in ruling or observing rules; rectitude or right reason; in early times up to A. D. 500, the Buddhists called themselves |人 men [seeking for] reason or intelligent men, denoting thereby their aspirations after ''pu-ti'' (Sanscrit, ''boddhi'') intelligence; the Reason or Logos of the Rationalists, denoting an emanation, the unknown factor or principle of nature, the way it acts in matter and mind; to lead; to direct, to follow out; to go in a designated path; to speak, to talk, to converse; as a ''preposition'', by, from; the way or cause a thing comes; a classifier of courses at a feast, edicts and dispatches, gateways, walls, rivers, bridges, &amp;c.; a coating, a layer. (1874: 867)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The entry's 39 word and usage examples—which use Morrison's "|" abbreviation for the head character 道—include common expressions (''bùzhīdào'' 不知道 "I don't know", ''dàolù'' 道路 "a way; a road"), [[Christianity in China|Chinese Christian expressions]] (''zìgǔdào'' 自古道 "as saith the proverb"), [[Glossary of Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist terms]] (''dédào'' 得道 "to become perfect and enter ''nirvana''; used by Budhists {{sic}}"), and literary [[chengyu|set phrases]] (''Dàoxīn wéi wēi'' 道心惟微 "the principle of right in the heart is small" comes from the ''[[Book of Documents]]'' contrasting the 人心 "human heart-mind" and the 道心 "Way's heart-mind": "The mind of man is restless, prone (to err); its affinity to what is right is small", tr. Legge).

==Reception==
Scholars have both praised and criticized Williams’s dictionary. One of the first reviewers did both. Willem Pieter Groeneveldt praises Williams for "surpassing all those before him, he has given us a dictionary better than any existing before" and advises every student of Chinese to buy this "great boon to sinology" (1874: 226, 232); and yet he criticizes Williams for including "fanciful" etymological definitions based on character components instead of scientific philology, the "indiscriminate introduction of the colloquial element", and presenting yet another new system of romanization (1874: 228, 229, 232).

The American missionary Henry Blodget's 1874 review in the ''[[New York Observer]]'' says, "this Dictionary, as a whole, is a treasury of knowledge in regard to China and Chinese affairs, a treasury accumulated by many years of study both of Protestant and Roman Catholic missionaries" (Williams 1889: 399).

The British consular officer and linguist [[Herbert Giles]] published a 40-page brochure ''On some Translations and Mistranslations in Dr. Williams’ Syllabic Dictionary'', saying that it is "though in many ways an improvement upon its predecessors, is still unlikely to hold the fort for any indefinitely long period" (1879: 1). As an example, for Williams' translation of ''[[Bamboo wife|zhúfūrén]]'' 竹夫人 as "A long bamboo pillow", Giles gives, "Literally, a bamboo wife. A hollow cylindrical leg-rest, made of bamboo. Commonly known to Europeans as a 'Dutch wife'" (1879: 7). However, Williams did not reply to Giles’ challenges, but consistently reprinted his dictionary until 1909 (Yang 2014: 317). Giles criticized Williams as "the lexicographer not for the future but of the past", and took nearly twenty years to compile his (1892) ''[[A Chinese-English Dictionary]]'' (Wilkinson 2013: 85).

Censuring Williams' dictionary for transliterating pronunciation from a "general average" of regional variants rather than Peking pronunciation, James Acheson wrote an index arranged according to [[Thomas Francis Wade]]'s orthography, citing the frustration that many dictionary users who after "repeated failures to find the commonest characters without reference to the radical index or, failing here as often happens, to the List of Difficult Characters" (1879: 1).

The American sinologist [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] (1988: 173) credits Williams' ''A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language'' as apparently the first dictionary to properly distinguish between aspirated and unaspirated stops.

A recent book on Chinese lexicography (Yong and Peng 2008: 387) says Williams' ''Syllabic Dictionary'' was the first dictionary of its kind to contain pronunciations from four regional [[varieties of Chinese]]: [[Beijing dialect|Pekingese]], [[Cantonese]], [[Amoy dialect|Xiamenese]], and [[Shanghainese]].

[[Image:SoP cover 1930.png|thumb|right|The cover of the 1930 edition]]

The '''''American Standard of Perfection''''' is the official [[breed standard]] for the [[poultry]] [[Animal fancy|fancy]] in [[North America]]. First published in 1874 by the [[American Poultry Association]], the ''Standard of Perfection'' (commonly referred to as "the ''Standard''") classifies and describes the standard physical appearance, coloring and temperament for all recognized [[breed]]s of poultry, including [[chicken]]s, [[Domestic duck|ducks]], [[Domestic turkey|turkeys]], and [[Domestic goose|geese]].  The current edition was published in 2010.

The ''Standard'' is used by American Poultry Association judges at sanctioned [[Livestock show|poultry shows]] to judge poultry, and by those who participate in the competitive showing of [[Selective breeding|selectively bred]] birds that conform to the standard, which led to the term "standard bred" poultry.

The first edition of the book listed 41 breeds, and today's versions have nearly 60. There are 19 classes of poultry recognized by the American Poultry Association. Eleven of these classes are devoted to chickens, of which six are classes of large breeds and five are [[Bantam (chicken)|bantam]] classes. There are four classes of ducks and three classes of geese, both divided by weight. All breeds of turkeys are grouped into one class.


==List of American Poultry Association Classes==
'''Standard:''' [[American Class (chicken breeds)|American]], [[Asiatic Class|Asiatic]], [[Continental Class (chicken breeds)|Continental]], [[English Class (chicken breeds)|English]], [[Mediterranean Class (chicken breeds)|Mediterranean]], and [[All Other Standard Breeds]] &lt;br/&gt;

'''Bantam:''' Single Comb Clean Legged (SCCL), Rose Comb Clean Legged (RCCL), All Other Comb Clean Legged (AOCCL), Feather Legged, and Game Bantam&lt;br/&gt;

'''Ducks:''' Heavy, Medium, Light, and Bantam&lt;br/&gt;

'''Geese:''' Heavy, Medium, and Light&lt;br/&gt;

'''Turkeys:''' Judged as one class.

'''Guinea Fowl:''' Judged as one class.

==History==
In 1902, [[Irene Lewisohn|Irene]] and [[Alice Lewisohn]] became teenage heiresses and decided to join other wealthy New York friends in community work. They began to spend time at the [[Henry Street Settlement]] House in New York, a community center devoted to the integration of immigrant families and since 1909 host to summer camps for girls and boys from underprivileged New York families. {{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Alice, who acted in plays herself, began working as a drama teacher, while Irene devoted herself to dance productions. While at the Settlement House they also began to present performances and in 1915, the sisters joined Rita Wallach Morgenthau to build and found the [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] on the corner of Grand and Pitt Streets, where between 1915 and 1927, the theater presented plays by Shaw, Joyce, and Dunsany. [[File:Robe à la française 1740s.jpg|thumb|left|Robe à la française 1740s, as seen in one of the exhibits at the Costume Institute]]Now called the [[Abrons Arts Center]], the theater continues to showcase many Settlement arts programs. [[Aline Bernstein]] served her apprenticeship there from 1915-1924 designing costumes and stage sets. From 1928 the four women moved their operations to the  [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre]] at 340 East 54th Street. There it became an actor training school and students were offered a two-year program formal drama and dance training to become professionals. Both [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Anna Sokolow]] were students of [[Martha Graham]] there.

During their years of running the school theatre and producing plays, a body of knowledge was formed about acting, theater production, and costume, set and stage design. Eventually Irene opened a home for her library called the Museum of Costume Art on Fifth Avenue in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/68652.html |title=1944 |accessdate=2008-12-16 |quote=Philanthropist Irene Lewisohn died today in New York City.

After the war in 1946 it moved to the first floor of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and in 1960 the two organizations merged, and the Met is now home to the Irene Lewisohn Costume Reference Library.

Since 1946, with help from the fashion publicist [[Eleanor Lambert]], the institute has hosted the annual [[Met Gala]], to raise money for operating expenses.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

In 2008, the American Costume Collection of the [[Brooklyn Museum]] merged into the Costume Institute, a cost-saving scheme coming after years of close collaboration between the two organizations. The collection of the Brooklyn museum is older, having been formed from private donations by former New York high society personalities, beginning with the donation in 1903 of an 1892 cream crepe dress worn by Kate Mallory Williams at her graduation from Brooklyn Heights Seminary.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/arts/design/16muse.html Brooklyn Museum’s Costume Treasures Going to the Met], New York Times article in December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the move, 23,500 objects from the Brooklyn collection were digitized and these images are now shared by both organizations.&lt;ref name=Artstor&gt;[http://www.artstor.org/what-is-artstor/w-html/col-brooklyn-costume.shtml Collection of the Brooklyn Museum costumes] on Artstor&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the merger, the Met costume collection consisted of 31,000 objects from the 17th-century onwards.&lt;ref name=Artstor/&gt; The opening exhibition in 2014 featured work by British-born designer [[Charles James (designer)|Charles James]], an important figure in New York fashion of the 1940s and 1950s and whose work is in the Brooklyn collection.

On September 8, 2015, it was announced that [[Harold Koda]] would be stepping down from his position as Curator in Charge of the Costume Institute. Andrew Bolton, who had joined the Costume Institute in 2002 as associate curator and was made curator in 2006, was announced as his replacement.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/press/news/2015/harold-koda-retirement&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, the Costume Institute featured an exhibition featuring the works of [[Rei Kawakubo]]/[[Comme des Garçons]]. The exhibit was the Costume Institute's first exhibition focusing on a living designer since [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vogue.com/13495073/met-gala-2017-theme-rei-kawakubo-comme-des-garcons/&lt;/ref&gt;

(It) practically disappeared. It resurfaced once again, however, to assassinate important members of the Lebanese section of the Dashnak Party (March 1985 – May 1986)."&lt;/ref&gt; It was described as a [[terrorist organization]] by some sources,&lt;ref&gt;John E.

==Origins==
100 years had passed since the [[Ottoman Empire]] had embarked on the campaign to exterminate its Armenian population, which was largely concentrated in its eastern provinces, referred to at the time as [[Western Armenia]]. The survivors of the massacres and deprivations commonly seen in the [[death marches]] found refuge in other countries in [[Western Asia]], as well as in Western Europe and North America. While the key ringleaders of the genocide were assassinated in the 1920s by Armenians (''see [[Operation Nemesis]]''), the Ottoman Empire's successor, the [[Republic of Turkey]], stated that a genocide had not taken place. It actively campaigned against any and all attempts to publicise the events and bring about recognition in the West. It blamed Armenians for instigating the violence and alleged that Armenians had massacred thousands of Turks, prompting the commencement of their deportations. In 1965, Armenians around the world publicly marked the 50th anniversary and began to campaign for world recognition. As peaceful marches and demonstrations failed to move an intransigent Turkey, the younger generation of Armenians, resentful at the [[Denial of the Armenian Genocide|denial by Turkey]] and the failure by their parents' generation to effect change, sought new approaches to bringing about [[Armenian Genocide recognition|recognition]] and reparations.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Moussault (red.) &amp; Barbara Sahakian, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zXZ_rgEACAAJ&amp;dq=ASALA+de+Nemesis+voor+de+Armeense+genocide.+Stadsguerrilla+tegen+Turkije&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y “ASALA de Nemesis voor de Armeense genocide.

In 1973, two Turkish diplomats were assassinated in [[Los Angeles]] by [[Kourken Yanigian]], an elderly man who survived the [[Armenian Genocide]]. This event might have been forgotten had it not initiated a chain of events which turned it, and its perpetrator, into a symbol representing the end of the conspiracy of silence which since 1915 had surrounded the Armenian Genocide.&lt;ref name="JCSS"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kurz &amp; Merari | first = Anat &amp; Ariel | title = JCSS Study No. 2 ASALA – Irrational Terror or Political Tool | publisher = The Jerusalem Post | year = 1985 | location = Jerusalem | pages = 3 | isbn = 0-8133-0324-9|quote= The ideology informing ASALA's activities is therefore nationalistic and leftist, with a strong accent on motives such as revenge on Turkey, and on forcing the world to recognize the historic injustice inflicted on the Armenians.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASALA was founded in 1975 in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] by [[Hagop Hagopian (guerilla)|Hagop Hagopian]] (Harutiun Tagushian), pastor Reverend [[James Karnusian]]&lt;ref&gt;Rev.

The group's activities were primarily assassinations of Turkish diplomats and politicians in Western Europe, the United States and Western Asia.&lt;ref name="countrystudy" /&gt; Their first acknowledged killing was the assassination of the Turkish diplomat, [[Daniş Tunalıgil]], in [[Vienna]] on October 22, 1975. A failed attack in [[Geneva]] on October 3, 1980, in which two Armenian militants were injured resulted in a new nickname for the group, the 3 October Organization. ASALA's eight-point manifesto was published in 1981.

Historian Fatma Göçek describes the stated aims of ASALA as "righteous" but the means sought for these aims, i.e. the "wilful murder [of] innocent people" as not righteous, and thus argues that it was a terrorist organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Göçek |first1=Fatma Müge |title=The Transformation of Turkey: Redefining State and the Society from the Ottoman Empire to the Modern Era |date=2011 |publisher=I.B.

{{See also|List of attacks by ASALA}}
According to the [[National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism|MIPT]] website, there had been 84 incidents involving ASALA leaving 46 dead and 299 injured, including the following:&lt;ref name="MIPT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=258 |title=MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base |date=15 November 2007 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115020146/http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=258 |archivedate=2007-11-15 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 1975, Turkish Ambassador in [[Austria]], [[Danis Tunaligil]] was assassinated by three members of ASALA. Two days later, the Turkish Ambassador in [[France]], [[Ismail Erez]] and his chauffeur were killed. Both ASALA and [[JCAG]] claimed responsibility.

The first two ASALA militants, arrested on October 3, 1980, were [[Alex Yenikomshian]] and Suzy Mahserejian, who were wounded after the accidental explosion of a bomb in a hotel in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;Le Combat armenien: entre terrorisme et utopie : Lausanne, 1923–1983, by Armand Gaspard, L'AGE D'HOMME, 1984, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1981 Turkish consulate attack in Paris]] (''Van operation'') ASALA militants held 56 hostages for fifteen hours; it became the first operation of its kind. Militants demanded release of [[political prisoner]]s in [[Turkey]] including two Armenian clergymen, 5 Turks and 5 Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;Guerilla threat to kill 40 in Paris siege, [[The Sydney Morning Herald]], Sep. 25, 1981, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of the takeover received one of the highest television ratings in France in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Children of Armenia, by M.

One of the most known attacks of ASALA was [[Esenboga airport attack]] on August 7, 1982 in [[Ankara]], when its members targeted non-diplomat civilians for the first time. Two militants opened fire in a crowded passenger waiting room. One of the shooters took more than 20 hostages while the second was apprehended by police. Altogether, nine people died and 82 were injured. The arrested militant Levon Ekmekjian condemned the attack in its aftermath and appealed to other members of ASALA to stop the violence.

On August 10, 1982, [[Artin Penik]] a [[Armenians in Turkey|Turk of Armenian descent]], set himself on fire in protest of this attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Oran | first = Baskın | title = The Reconstruction of Armenian Identity in Turkey and the Weekly Agos (Interview with Hrant Dink) | work = Nouvelles d'Armenie | date = 2006-12-17 | url = http://www.armenews.com/article.php3?id_article=27696 | accessdate = 2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Armenian Issue: Chronology |publisher=[[Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] |url=http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313A781CAA92714FCE0A3216081A23BEF0D |accessdate=2007-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523010926/http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313A781CAA92714FCE0A3216081A23BEF0D |archivedate=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=He was an Armenian: Artin Penik|work=Turkish Journal|url=http://www.turkishjournal.com/i.php?newsid=361|accessdate=2007-02-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070305044323/http://www.turkishjournal.com/i.php?newsid=361| archivedate= 5 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Armenian Dies from Self-Inflicted Burns | agency=[[Associated Press]]| date = 1982-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 1983, ASALA carried out another [[1983 Orly Airport attack|attack]] at the [[Orly Airport]] near Paris, in which 8 people were killed, most of them not being Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Forst, Jack R.

The split resulted in emergence of two groups, the ''ASALA-Militant'' led by Hagopian and the 'Revolutionary Movement' (''ASALA-Mouvement Révolutionnaire'') led by [[Monte Melkonian]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey W.

Afterwards, French forces promptly arrested those involved.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/09/world/around-the-world-french-hold-armenians-in-orly-airport-bombing.html French Hold Armenians In Orly Airport Bombing]", [[Associated Press]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 9, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this attack eliminated the suspected secret agreement that the French socialist government made with ASALA, in which the government would allow ASALA to use France as a base of operations in exchange for refraining from launching attacks on French soil. Belief in this suspected agreement was further bolstered after "Interior Minister [[Gaston Defferre]] called [ASALA's] cause "just", and four Armenians arrested for taking hostages at the Turkish Embassy in September 1981 were given light sentences."&lt;ref&gt;Echikson, William.

===Reactions===
Continuous attacks by ASALA prompted Turkey to accuse [[Cyprus]], Greece, [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], and the Soviet Union of provoking or possibly funding ASALA.&lt;ref name="countrystudy" /&gt; Although they publicly distanced themselves from ASALA,&lt;ref name="countrystudy" /&gt; Turkey's Armenian community came under attack by Turkish nationalists in reaction to the group's actions. This became apparent after the assassination of [[Ahmet Benler]] on October 12, 1979 by Armenian militants in [[the Hague]]. The reaction to the attack led to the bombing of the church of the Armenian Apostolic Patriarchate in [[Istanbul]] on October 19 in retaliation.&lt;ref name="azadhye"&gt;[[Tessa Hofmann|Tessa, Hofmann]]. [http://www.armenian.ch/asa/Docs/faae02.pdf Armenians in Turkey today]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, the Turkish government arrested Armenian priest Fr. [[Manuel Yergatian]] at the Istanbul airport for the alleged possession of maps that indicated Armenian territory within modern-day Turkey and was sentenced to 14 years in prison for possible ties with ASALA. [[Amnesty International]] adopted him as a prisoner of conscience, concluding that the evidence against him was baseless.&lt;ref name="azadhye" /&gt; According to [[Tessa Hofmann]], Turkish officials frequently used the accusation of collaboration with ASALA and foreign Armenian circles to incriminate extreme left-wing Turkish opposition groups.&lt;ref name="azadhye" /&gt;

After the ASALA attack against the [[Esenboğa International Airport]] in August 1982 the then President of Turkey [[Kenan Evren]] issued a decree for the elimination of ASALA. The task was given to the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization]]'s Foreign Operations Department. Evren's own daughter, a member of the MİT, ran the operation together with Foreign Intelligence Department chief Metin (Mete) Günyol, and Istanbul region director [[Nuri Gündeş]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.aksiyon.com.tr/detay.php?id=15119 |accessdate=2008-12-13 |title=Asala operasyonlarını Kenan Evren'in kızı yönetti |date=2004-09-06 |first=Faruk |last=Mercan |authorlink=Faruk Mercan |volume=509 |publisher=Feza Gazetecilik A.Ş. |journal=''[[Aksiyon]]'' |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426171629/http://www.aksiyon.com.tr/detay.php?id=15119 |archivedate=April 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/2004/09/08/siy112.html |accessdate=2008-12-13 |title=Evren: Kızım MİT'te çalışıyordu |date=2004-09-08 |language=Turkish |work=Sabah |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616050947/http://www.sabah.com.tr/2004/09/08/siy112.html |archivedate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levon Ekmekjian was captured and placed in Ankara's Mamak Prison. He was told that he had to choose between confessing and being executed. After being promised that his comrades would not be harmed, he revealed how ASALA worked to a team led by MİT's Presidential Liaison and Evren's son-in-law, Erkan Gürvit. He was tried by Ankara martial law command military court, and sentenced to death. His appeal of the sentence was declined, and he was hanged on 29 January 1983.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, February 2, 1983.

In the early spring of 1983 two teams were sent to France and Lebanon. Günyol tapped [[contract killer]] [[Abdullah Çatlı]], who had just finished serving a prison sentence in Switzerland for [[drug trafficking]], to lead the French contingent.

A second French unit was assembled under MİT operative Sabah Ketene. The Lebanese contingent, consisting only of MİT operatives and members of the "Special Warfare Department" ([[special forces]]), was led by MİT officer [[Hiram Abas]].&lt;ref name="efsane" /&gt;&lt;!-- Avrupa'da eylem yapacak birinci ekibin ülkücü Abdullah Çatlı ve arkadaşlarından oluşturulmasına karar verildi.

Ekip lideri ise MİT yöneticisi Hiram Abas'tı. Ekip altı kişiden oluşuyordu. --&gt;

The bomb that Çatlı's team had planted in Ara Toranyan's car on 22 March 1983 did not explode. A follow-up attempt also failed. Toranyan said they had planted the bomb in the wrong car. Likewise, Henri Papazyan's car bomb on 1 May 1984 did not explode. Çatlı claimed credit for killing [[Hagop Hagopian (guerilla)|Hagop Hagopian]], however he was in a French prison (again, on narcotics charges) at the time of the attack. Papazyan is now believed to have been killed as a result of infighting. The second French team (led by Ketene) did carry out some attacks (which Çatlı also claimed credit for), such as the 1984 Alfortville monument and Salle Pleyel concert room attacks. It is unknown whether the Lebanese contingent did anything at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2008/09/28/haber,6BC4820941214D84A08DD404742B2C6F.html |accessdate=2008-12-25 |title=Boş konser salonu bombalandı |date=2008-09-28 |work=Sabah |first=Ecevit |last=Kilic |language=Turkish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204043711/http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2008/09/28/haber%2C6BC4820941214D84A08DD404742B2C6F.html |archivedate=4 December 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution==
With the [[1982 Lebanon War|Israeli invasion of Lebanon]] in 1982 the group lost much of its organization and support. Sympathetic Palestinian organizations including the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) withdrew their support and passed materials to the French intelligence services in 1983, detailing ASALA operatives. The last attack, on 19 December 1991, targeted the bullet-proof limousine carrying the Turkish Ambassador to [[Budapest]]. The ambassador was not injured in the attack, which was claimed by ASALA in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tkb.org/Incident.jsp?incID=6723 |title=ASALA attacked Diplomatic target|date=1981-12-19|location=Hungary|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827173744/http://www.tkb.org/Incident.jsp?incID=6723|archivedate=2007-08-27|work=[[MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASALA's founder [[Hagop Hagopian (guerilla)|Hagop Hagopian]] was assassinated on a sidewalk in an affluent neighborhood in [[Athens]], Greece on April 28, 1988. He was shot several times while he was walking with two women at 4:30 in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;Melkonian, Markar. ''My Brother's Road: An American's Fateful Journey to Armenia''.

New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005, pp. 277–278.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Turkish [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization]] official Nuri Gündeş, ASALA was dissolved after the assassination of Hagopian. According to Turkish sources, another reason is that financial backing was withdrawn by the Armenian diaspora after the [[1983 Orly Airport attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=-599507 |accessdate=2008-12-21 |title=Thanks to Nuri Gündeş |work=[[Turkish Daily News]] |publisher=[[Hürriyet]] |date=2008-12-21 |first=Mehmet Ali |last=Birand |quote=&lt;!-- It was not the right wing militant and mafia boss Çatlı or mafia boss Çakıcı that finished off the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA).

Feeling ill at ease by the raid, the French and U.S. Armenians who used to support ASALA monetarily stopped the aid and the issue was closed. I know this through French authorities that were involved. The ones that were instrumental in the stopping of the aid were MİT and the Foreign Ministry. Otherwise, ASALA did not yield because it was afraid of the Turkish bullies. They were stopped because they had gone too far with their murders.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HAHKPanag95.jpg|thumb|An ASALA publication (1995)]]
Since the 1970s the ASALA Information Branch published books, booklets, posters and other promotional materials. ''Hayasdan'' ('Armenia') was the official [[multi-lingual]] organ of ASALA published in 1980–1987 and 1991–1997. The first issue was published in October 1980 and contained 40 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Mamule 1967–1980, by Zhirair Danielyan, Haigazian handes, hador T, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The place of publication and names of contributors are not known. It was published monthly, sometimes with united volumes. The main language was [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. From 1983 to 1987 it had separate issues in Arabic, English, French and Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;The Armenian Question, encyclopedia, Ed. by acad. K. Khudaverdyan, Yerevan, 1996, p. 209, ''Hayaqsdan'' by A. Sanjian&lt;/ref&gt; The journal published editorials, official announcements of ASALA, and articles on political and military issues. ''Hayasdan'' was distributed free of charge in Armenian communities.

The journal's mottos were "The armed struggle and right political line are the way to Armenia" and "Viva the revolutionary solidarity of oppressed people!" It had sister publications including left-wing ''Hayasdan Gaydzer'' ([[London]]) and ''Hayasdan – Hay Baykar'' ([[Paris]]) which used "Hayasdan" in their titles since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[[Spurk]] journal, #12, 1991, p. 32 ''Hayasdan Gaydzer''&lt;/ref&gt; Both were published by the Popular Movements which worked towards mobilising support among Armenians for a political movement focused on ASALA.&lt;ref&gt;Armenians in London: The Management of Social Boundaries. by Vered Amit Talai, Vered Amit, Manchester University Press, 1989, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arnamagnæan Manuscript Collection''' ({{lang-da|Den Arnamagnæanske Håndskriftsamling}}, {{lang-is|Handritasafn Árna Magnússonar}}) derives its name from the Icelandic scholar and antiquarian [[Árni Magnússon]] (1663–1730) — Arnas Magnæus in Latinised form — who in addition to his duties as secretary of the Royal Archives and professor of Danish Antiquities at the [[University of Copenhagen]], spent much of his life building up the collection of manuscripts that now bears his name.  The majority of these manuscripts were from Árni’s native Iceland, but he also acquired many important Norwegian, Danish and Swedish manuscripts, as well as a number of other, chiefly continental, provenance.  After being housed since Árni's death at the University of Copenhagen, in the [[Arnamagnæan Institute]], under a 1965 parliamentary ruling the collection is now divided between there and the [[Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies]] in [[Reykjavík]], Iceland.

==History==

When Árni died in 1730 he bequeathed his collection to the University of Copenhagen, whereupon it became part of the University Library. The collection has been augmented over the years through individual purchases and gifts and the acquisition of a number of smaller collections, for example that of the Danish grammarian [[Rasmus Rask]], bringing the total number of items to around 3000. In 1956 the Arnamagnæan Institute ({{lang-da|Det Arnamagnæanske Institut}}, now ''Den Arnamagnæanske Samling'', The Arnamagnæan Collection) was established to care for and further the study of the manuscripts in the collection.

Even before its constitutional separation from Denmark in 1944, Iceland had begun to petition for the return of these manuscripts. After much heated debate, the Danish parliament decided in May 1965 that such documents in the Arnamagnæan Collection as might be held to be "Icelandic cultural property" (''islandsk kultureje'') — broadly defined as a work composed or translated by an Icelander and whose content is wholly or chiefly concerned with Iceland — were to be transferred to the newly established Icelandic Manuscript Institute (now the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies, {{lang-is|Stofnun Árna Magnússonar í íslenskum fræðum}}), a part of the University of Iceland. It further provided for the transfer from the [[Danish Royal Library]] (''Det kongelige Bibliotek'') of manuscripts belonging to the same categories as the manuscripts relinquished by the Arnamagnæan Institute, and contained a special clause relating to the transfer to Iceland of two manuscripts, the [[Codex Regius]] of the [[Poetic Edda]] and the vellum codex [[Flateyjarbók]], both of which were in the Royal Library (and would not have been deemed ''islandsk kultureje'' under the terms of the treaty). These were handed over to Iceland in a ceremony held immediately after the ratification of the treaty in 1971. The first consignment of manuscripts was dispatched from Copenhagen to Reykjavík in June 1973 and the last two were handed over in June 1997. Altogether a total of 1,666 manuscripts, and all the Icelandic charters and apographa, have been transferred to Iceland, slightly over half the collection, in addition to 141 manuscripts from the Royal Library.  Of the manuscripts remaining in Copenhagen about half are Icelandic but have as their chief concern matters not directly related to Iceland, e.g. the histories of the kings of Norway and Denmark, religious texts or translations from Latin and other languages.

In 2009 the Arnamagnæan Manuscript Collection was added to [[UNESCO]]’s [[Memory of the World Register]] in recognition of its historical value.&lt;ref name=mow&gt;{{cite web|title= Arnamagnæan Manuscript Collection |url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-1/arnamagnaean-manuscript-collection/ | date=2009-07-31 |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank and Joseph Bily were born in the late 19th century in Spillville, Iowa. They went on to become farmers as well as carpenters. They took upon clockmaking as their hobby, carving and creating complex, finely detailed works of art out of wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bily-clocks-museum|title=Bily Clocks Museum|website=Atlas Obscura|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bily brothers were originally going to burn their creations when they died, but they later donated their collection to the city of Spillville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8052">The '''cabinet card''' was a style of photograph which was widely used for photographic portraiture after 1870. It consisted of a thin photograph mounted on a card typically measuring 108 by 165&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|4|1|4}} by {{frac|6|1|2}} inches).

==History==
[[Image:Cab-card-wis-front.jpg|thumb|left|350px|A photograph of a [[wedding party]] probably from the late 1870s to 1880s. (Note the black or dark-colored [[white wedding|wedding]] dress, which was common during the early to mid-19th century.)]]

The ''[[carte de visite]]'' was displaced by the larger cabinet card in the 1880s. In the early 1860s, both types of photographs were essentially the same in process and design.  Both were most often [[albumen print]]s, the primary difference being the cabinet card was larger and usually included extensive logos and information on the reverse side of the card to advertise the photographer’s services.  However, later into its popularity, other types of papers began to replace the albumen process.  Despite the similarity, the cabinet card format was initially used for landscape views before it was adopted for portraiture.

Some cabinet card images from the 1890s have the appearance of a black-and-white photograph in contrast to the distinctive sepia toning notable in the albumen print process. These photographs have a neutral image tone and were most likely produced on a matte [[Collodion process|collodion]], [[Gelatin-silver process|gelatin]] or gelatin bromide paper.

Sometimes images from this period can be identified by a greenish cast. Gelatin papers were introduced in the 1870s and started gaining acceptance in the 1880s and 1890s as the gelatin bromide papers became popular. Matte collodion was used in the same period. A true black-and-white image on a cabinet card is likely to have been produced in the 1890s or after 1900. The last cabinet cards were produced in the 1920s, even as late as 1924.

Owing to the larger image size, the cabinet card steadily increased in popularity during the second half of the 1860s and into the 1870s, replacing the ''carte de visite'' as the most popular form of portraiture. The cabinet card was large enough to be easily viewed from across the room when typically displayed on a cabinet, which is probably why they became known as such in the vernacular. However, when the renowned [[American Civil War|Civil War]] photographer [[Mathew Brady]] first started offering them to his clientele towards the end of 1865, he used the trademark "Imperial Carte-de-Visite."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mathewbrady.com/processes.htm |title=Glossary of Some of the Major Photographic Processes |date=2004 |website=Mathew Brady |access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the name, the popular print format joined the photograph album as a fixture in the late 19th-century Victorian parlor.

[[Image:Cab-card-wis-back.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The reverse side of the card as seen above.]]

Early in its introduction, the cabinet card ushered in the temporary disuse of the photographic album which had come into existence commercially with the ''carte de visite''.  Photographers began employing artists to retouch photographs by altering the negative before making the print to hide facial defects revealed by the new format. Small stands and photograph frames for the table top replaced the heavy photograph album. Photo album manufacturers responded by producing albums with pages primarily for cabinet cards with a few pages in the back reserved for the old family ''carte de visite'' prints.

For nearly three decades after the 1860s, the commercial portraiture industry was dominated by the ''carte de visite'' and cabinet card formats. In the decade before 1900, the number and variety of card photograph styles expanded in response to declining sales. Manufacturers of standardized card stock and print materials hoped to stimulate sales and retain public interest in card photographs. However, the public increasingly demanded outdoor and candid photographs with enlarged prints which they could frame or smaller unmounted snapshots they could collect in scrapbooks.

Owing in part to the immense popularity of the affordable [[Brownie (camera)|Kodak Box Brownie]] camera, first introduced in 1900, the public increasingly began taking their own photographs, and thus the popularity of the cabinet card declined.&lt;ref name="A history of the cabinet card"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.city-gallery.com/learning/types/cabinet_card/index.php |title=Cabinet Card |website=City Gallery |access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
* '''Introduced''': 1860.  First used for horizontal views, then eventually adapted for portraits.
* '''Peak popularity''': 1880s. Although not uncommon in the 1870s, the cabinet card did not displace the carte de visite completely until the 1880s.
* '''Decline''': 1890s.  As snapshot and personal photography became commonplace among the public, the popularity of the cabinet card and cabinet card specific albums waned. Unmounted paper prints and the scrapbook albums started replacing them. A variety of other large card styles of various names and dimensions came about for professional portraits in the 1880s and 1890s. After 1900, card photographs generally had a much larger area surrounding the print quite often with an embossed frame around the image on heavy, gray card stock.
* '''Last Used''': The cabinet card still had a place in public consumption and continued to be produced until the early 1900s and quite a bit longer in Europe. The last cabinet cards were produced in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="A history of the cabinet card"/&gt;

==Dating a cabinet card==
[[File:Walther edwin anna.jpeg|upright=1.4|thumb|A cabinet card from 1896]]

When attempting to determine the date of creation for a cabinet card, clues can be gathered by the details on the card.  The type of card stock or whether it had right-angled or rounded corners can often help to determine the date of the photograph to as close as five years.  However, it has to be noted that these dating methods aren't always 100% accurate, since a Victorian photographer may have been using up old card stock, or the cabinet card may have been a re-print made many years after the photo was originally recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.about.com/od/photo_dating/p/cabinet_card.htm About: Genealogy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''Christian left''' refers to a spectrum of [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] and [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Christianity and politics|Christian political]] and social movements that largely embrace viewpoints described as [[social justice]] and uphold a [[social gospel]]. Given the inherent diversity in international political thought, the term can have different meanings and applications in different countries. Although there is some overlap, the Christian left is distinct from [[liberal Christianity]], meaning not all Christian leftists are liberal Christians, and vice versa. Some Christian leftists also have [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] views on some social issues while left-leaning on some economic issues.

==Terminology==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2018}}
As with any section within the [[left–right politics|left and right wings]] of a [[political spectrum]], a label such as "Christian left" represents an approximation, including within it groups and persons holding many diverse viewpoints. The term left-wing might encompass a number of values, some of which may or may not be held by different Christian movements and individuals.

As the unofficial title of a loose association of believers, it does provide a clear distinction from the more commonly known "[[Christian right]]" or "religious right" and from its key [[leader]]s and political views.

The most common religious viewpoint that might be described as "left-wing" is [[social justice]], or care for [[poverty|impoverished]] and oppressed [[minority groups|groups]]. Supporters of this trend  might encourage [[universal health care]], [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] provisions, subsidized education, [[foreign aid]], and [[affirmative action]] for improving the conditions of the disadvantaged. With values stemming from [[egalitarianism]], adherents of the Christian left consider it part of their religious duty to take actions on behalf of the oppressed. As nearly all major religions contain some kind of requirement to [[golden rule|help others]], various religions{{quantify|date=October 2014}} have cited social justice as a movement in line with their faith.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The Christian left holds that social justice, renunciation of power, humility, forgiveness, and private observation of prayer (as opposed to publicly mandated prayer), are mandated by the [[Gospel]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 6:5-6).{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The Bible contains accounts of Jesus repeatedly advocating for the poor and outcast over the wealthy, powerful, and religious. The Christian left maintains that such a stance is relevant and important. Adhering to the standard of "[[turning the other cheek]]", which they believe supersedes the [[Old Testament]] law of "[[an eye for an eye]]", the Christian left often{{quantify|date=October 2014}} hearkens towards [[pacifism]] in opposition to policies advancing [[militarism]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Some among the Christian left,&lt;ref&gt;John Cort, ''Christian Socialism'' (1988) {{ISBN|0-88344-574-3}}, pp. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some non-religious socialists, find support for [[socialism]] in the Gospels (for example [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] citing [[Jesus]] as "the first socialist").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/m/mikhail_s_gorbachev.html |publisher=Brainyquote.com |title=Mikhail S. Gorbachev Quotes |accessdate=23 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian left is a broad category that includes [[Christian socialism]], while also including non-socialists as well.

==History==

===Early years===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2012}}
For much of the early history of [[anti-establishment]] leftist movements such as [[socialism]] and [[communism]] (which was highly [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] in the 19th century), some established churches were led by clergy who saw revolution as a threat to their status and power. The church was sometimes seen as part of the establishment. [[Revolution]]s in [[United States|America]], France, [[Russia]] and (much later) Spain were in part directed against the established churches (or rather their leading clergy) and instituted a [[separation of church and state]].

However, in the 19th century some writers and activists developed a school of thought, [[Christian socialism]], a branch of Christian thought that was infused with [[socialism]].

Early [[socialist]] thinkers such as [[Robert Owen]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] based their theories of socialism upon Christian principles. [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] reacted against these theories by formulating a [[secular]] theory of socialism in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''.

===Alliance of the left and Christianity===
Starting in the late 19th century and early 20th century,{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} some began to take on the view that genuine Christianity had much in common with a leftist perspective. From [[St. Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' through [[St. Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia]]'', major Christian writers had expounded upon views that socialists found agreeable. Of major interest was the extremely strong thread of [[egalitarianism]] in the [[New Testament]]. Other common leftist concerns such as [[pacifism]], [[social justice]], [[racial equality]], [[human rights]], and the rejection of excessive [[wealth]] are also expressed strongly in the [[Bible]]. In the late 19th century, the [[Social Gospel]] movement arose (particularly among some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s, [[Methodist]]s and [[Baptists]] in [[North America]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]],) which attempted to integrate [[progressivism|progressive]] and [[socialist]] thought with [[Christianity]] to produce a faith-based social activism, promoted by movements such as [[Christian socialism]]. In the United States during this period, Episcopalians and Congregationalists generally tended to be the most liberal, both in theological interpretation and in their adherence to the Social Gospel. In Canada, a coalition of liberal Congregationalists, Methodists, and Presbyterians founded the [[United Church of Canada]], one of the first true Christian left denominations. Later in the 20th century, [[liberation theology]] was championed by such writers as [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]].

===Christians and workers===
To a significant degree, the Christian left developed out of the experiences of clergy who went to do pastoral work among the working class, often beginning without any social philosophy but simply a pastoral and evangelistic concern for workers. This was particularly true among the Methodists and Anglo-Catholics in England, Father [[Adolph Kolping]] in Germany and [[Joseph Cardijn]] in Belgium.

===Christian left and campaigns for peace and human rights===
{{See also|Peace churches}}
Some Christian groups were closely associated with the [[peace movement]]s against the [[Vietnam War]] as well as the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. Religious leaders in many countries have also been on the forefront of criticizing any cuts to [[social welfare]] programs. In addition, many prominent [[civil rights]] activists (such as [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]) were religious figures.

===In the United States===
In the United States, members of the Christian Left come from a spectrum of [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s: [[Peace churches]], elements of the [[Protestant]] [[mainline (Protestant)|mainline]] churches, [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholicism]], and some [[Evangelicalism in the United States|evangelical]]s.

In the aftermath of the [[United States elections, 2004|2004 election in the United States]], [[Progressive Christianity|progressive Christian]] [[leader]]s started to form groups of their own to combat the religious right. Such groups include the [[Center for Progressive Christianity]] (founded 1996) and the Christian Alliance for Progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Utter|first1 = Glenn H.|title = Mainline Christians and U.S. Public Policy: A Reference Handbook|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-l_HS1M2RmAC

==Beliefs==
===Homosexuality===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2018}}
The Christian left generally approaches [[homosexuality]] differently from other Christian political groups. This approach can be driven by focusing on issues differently despite holding similar religious views, or by holding different religious ideas. Those in the Christian left who have similar ideas as other Christian political groups but a different focus may view Christian teachings on certain issues, such as the Bible's prohibitions against killing or criticisms of concentrations of wealth, as far more politically important than Christian teachings on social issues emphasized by the [[Christian right|religious right]], such as opposition to homosexuality. Others in the Christian left have not only a different focus on issues from other Christian political groups, but different religious ideas as well.

For example, all members of the Christian left consider discrimination and bigotry against homosexuals to be immoral, but they differ on their views towards homosexual sex. Some believe homosexual sex to be immoral but largely unimportant when compared with issues relating to social justice, or even matters of sexual morality involving heterosexual sex. Others affirm that some homosexual practices are compatible with the Christian life. Such members believe common [[The Bible and homosexuality|biblical arguments]] used to condemn homosexuality are misinterpreted, and that biblical prohibitions of homosexual practices are actually against a specific type of homosexual sex act, i.e. [[pederasty]], the sodomizing of young boys by older men. Thus, they hold biblical prohibitions to be irrelevant when considering modern same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcpc.org/library/article.cfm?library_id=152 Why TCPC Advocates Equal Rights for Gay and Lesbian People] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212223001/http://www.tcpc.org/library/article.cfm?library_id=152 |date=12 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201012003/http://www.christianalliance.org/site/c.bnKIIQNtEoG/b.667209/k.5987/Equality_for_Gays_and_Lesbians.htm|title=Equality for Gays and Lesbians - Christian Alliance for Progress|date=1 December 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pflagdetroit.org/BibleandHomosexuality.html Bible &amp; Homosexuality Home Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224172958/http://www.pflagdetroit.org/BibleandHomosexuality.html |date=24 February 2015 }}.

===Consistent life ethic===
{{Main|Consistent life ethic}}
A related strain of thought is the (Catholic and progressive evangelical) [[consistent life ethic]], which sees opposition to [[capital punishment]], [[militarism]], [[euthanasia]], [[abortion]] and the global unequal distribution of wealth as being related. It is an idea with certain concepts shared by [[Abrahamic]] religions as well as [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Hinduism|Hindus]], and members of other religions. The late Cardinal [[Joseph Bernardin]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago|Chicago]] developed the idea for the consistent life ethic in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardin, Joseph. ''Consistent ethics of life'' 1988, Sheed and Ward, p. v&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, [[Sojourners Community|Sojourners]] is particularly associated with this strand of thought. Adherents commonly criticize politicians who identify as [[pro-life]] while simultaneously oppose funding for pre-natal vitamins, child nutrition programs, or [[universal health care]].

===Liberation theology===
[[Liberation theology]] is a theological tradition that emerged in the developing world, especially Latin America. Since the 1960s, Catholic thinkers have integrated left-wing thought and Catholicism, giving rise to Liberation Theology. It arose at a time when Catholic thinkers who opposed the despotic leaders in South and Central America allied themselves with the communist opposition. However, it developed independently of and roughly simultaneously with [[Black theology]] in the U.S. and should not be confused with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://koinoniarevolution.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/prophets-of-a-modern-era-an-introduction-to-liberation-theology/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027004008/http://koinoniarevolution.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/prophets-of-a-modern-era-an-introduction-to-liberation-theology/ |archivedate=27 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] decided that while liberation theology is partially compatible with Catholic social teaching, certain Marxist elements of it, such as the doctrine of perpetual class struggle, are against Church teachings.

[[File:Dongibogam.jpg|thumb|TOC of ''Dongui Bogam'']]

The '''''Dongui Bogam''''' (동의보감) is a [[Korean language|Korean]] book compiled by the royal physician, [[Heo Jun]] (1539 – 1615) and was first published in 1613 during the [[Joseon Dynasty]] of [[Korea]]. The title literally means “a priceless book about medicines of an Eastern Country”. The word "Eastern" is not the antonym to the Western World's 'Western', but Heo Jun gave the book such a name because Eastern Country was one of the [[Names of Korea|sobriquets of Korea]]. The book is regarded as important in [[traditional Korean medicine]], and is one of the classics of Oriental medicine today. As of July 2009, it is on [[UNESCO]]’s [[Memory of the World Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.korea.net/kois/eng_si_read.asp?slide_no=191 The History of Science in Korea] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222232827/http://www.korea.net/kois/eng_si_read.asp?slide_no=191 |date=December 22, 2008 }} Korean Culture and Information Service (KOIS)&lt;/ref&gt; The original edition of Dongui Bogam is currently preserved by the Korean National Library.&lt;ref name="db doosan"&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=50390 Dongui Bogam] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The original was written in [[Hanja]] and only part of it was transcribed in Korean for wide reading use, as only officials understood in [[Hanja|Hanmun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2011/04/142_49756.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409033523/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2011/04/142_49756.html |archivedate=2015-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated to English in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://kiom.re.kr/modedg/contentsView.do?ucont_id=CTX001017&amp;menu_nix=jFB45u4H&amp;srch_mu_lang=ENG&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Known as one of the classics in the history of Eastern medicine, it was published and used in many countries including China and Japan, and
remains a key reference work for the study of Eastern medicine. Its categorization and ordering of symptoms and remedies under the different
human organs affected, rather than the disease itself, was a revolutionary development at that time. It contains insights that in some cases did not enter the medical knowledge of Europe until the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.koreanhero.net/fiftywonders/FiftyWonders2_English.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904181045/http://www.koreanhero.net/fiftywonders/FiftyWonders2_English.pdf |archive-date=2012-09-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on the ''Dongui Bogam'' started in the 29th year of [[Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]]’s reign (1596) by the main physicians of ''Naeuiwon'' (내의원, “royal clinic”), with the objective to create a thorough compilation of traditional medicine. Main physician [[Heo Jun]] led the project but work was interrupted due to the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598)#Second invasion (1597–1598)|second Japanese invasion of Korea in 1597]]. King Seonjo did not see the project come to fruition, but Heo Jun steadfastedly stuck to the project and finally completed the work in 1610, the 2nd year of [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon|King Gwanghaegun]]’s reign.&lt;ref name="db doosan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="db kp"&gt;[http://www.koreanpress.net/news/view.asp?idx=3248&amp;msection=9&amp;ssection=54&amp;page=1 An ancient medical text gains worldwide recognition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723173113/http://www.koreanpress.net/news/view.asp?idx=3248&amp;msection=9&amp;ssection=54&amp;page=1 |date=July 23, 2011 }}, Korean Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==The book==
The ''Dongui Bogam'' consists of 25 volumes. In contrast to ''Hyangyak jipseongbang'' (향약집성방, "Compilation of Native Korean Prescriptions"), written in 1433, ''Dongui Bogam'' is more systematic. It not only refers to Korean medicinal texts, but also Chinese medicinal texts, and records illnesses practically with their respective remedies.&lt;ref name="db ekc"&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=236253&amp;v=44 Dongui Bogam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610014922/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=236253&amp;v=44 |date=June 10, 2011 }} at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contents===
The book is divided into 5 chapters: ''Naegyeongpyeon'' (내경편, 内景篇, Internal Medicine), ''Oehyeongpyeon'' (외형편, 外形篇, External Medicine), ''Japbyeongpyeon'' (잡병편, 難病編, Miscellaneous Diseases), ''Tangaekpyeon'' (탕액편, 湯液編, Remedies), and ''Chimgupyeon'' (침구편, 鍼灸編, Acupuncture).&lt;ref name="db ekc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-2/donguibogam-principles-and-practice-of-eastern-medicine/], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Naegyeongpyeon'' primarily deals with physiologic functions and equivalent disorders of internal organs. The interactions of five organs - [[liver]], [[lungs]], [[kidneys]], [[heart]], and [[spleen]] - are thoroughly explained.
*''Oehyeongpyeon'' explains the function of visible parts of the human body - skin, muscles, blood vessels, tendons, and bones - and the various related illnesses.
*''Japbyeongpyeon'' deals with diagnosis and healing methods of various illnesses and disorders such as [[anxiety]], over-excitement, [[stroke]], cold, [[nausea]], [[edema]], [[jaundice]], [[Carbuncle|carbunculosis]], and others. This chapter also has a section for [[pediatrics]] and [[gynecology]].
*''Tangaekpyeon'' details methods for creating remedies and potions such as the collection of medicinal herbs and plants, creating and handling of medication, correct prescription and administration of medicine. All herbal medicine is categorized with explanations regarding their strength, gathering period and their common names for easy understanding.
*''Chimgupyeon'' explains the acupuncture procedures for various ailments and disorders.

''Dongui Bogam'' offered not only medical facts, but also philosophical values of Eastern Asia. Heo Jun conveyed the message that maintaining the body’s energies in balance leads to one’s good health.  The first page of the book is an anatomical map of the human body, linking human body with heaven and earth which embodies the Asian perspective of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&amp;i=128011&amp;v=44 Dongui Bogam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610015025/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&amp;i=128011&amp;v=44 |date=June 10, 2011 }} at Britannica Korea&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editions===
There have been several print editions of ''Dongui Bogam'' besides the original ''Naeuiwon'' edition, within Korea and abroad. The first Chinese edition was printed in 1763 with additional prints in 1796, and 1890. The Japanese edition was first printed in 1724, and then 1799.&lt;ref name="db ekc"/&gt;

==UNESCO Memory of the World Register and controversy==
In 2009, UNESCO decided to add ''Dongui Bogam'' to the cultural heritage list due to its contribution as a historical relic and it was placed on [[UNESCO]]’s [[Memory of the World Programme]], becoming Korea's seventh cultural heritage to be thus included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/07/148_49413.html Dongui Bogam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130012157/http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/07/148_49413.html |date=January 30, 2010 }}, Korea Times, 2009-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt; However, doctors clashed over ''Dongui Bogam'' after the official listing. The Korean Medical Association (KMA) downplayed the book’s importance saying that “it shouldn’t be taken as anything more than a recognition of the book’s value as a historical relic. It should not be taken as an acknowledgement of traditional medicine for its superior effectiveness” Listing the fact that the book is full of quackery such as how to bear a son or how to make yourself invisible. The KMA emphasized that ''Dongui Bogam'' was merely a cultural artifact and not science. The Association of Korean Oriental Medicine (AKOM) criticized the doctors of KMA for the lack of their appreciation of the influence of ''Dongui Bogam'' and history, saying it is necessary “to inherit and advance traditional medicine”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2010/01/133_49602.html Doctors Clash Over ‘Mirror of Eastern Medicine’] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409002954/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2010/01/133_49602.html |date=April 9, 2015 }}, Korea Times, 2009-08-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Eight or Nine Wise Words about Letter-Writing''''' is an essay by [[Lewis Carroll]] on useful tips for composing, writing, mailing, and recording [[Letter (message)|letter]]s. The essay was published in 1890 by Emberlin and Son as a hardcover booklet consisting of 35 pages of text, followed by four pages of advertising, three pages of illustration, a stamp holder, and an illustration on the back cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carroll, Lewis|title=Eight or nine wise words on letter-writing|year=1890|publisher=Emberlin and Son|location=Oxford|url=https://archive.org/details/eightorninewisew00carr}}&lt;/ref&gt; This essay is of some importance in [[philately]] because it was part of the [[Lewis Carroll#Inventions|"Wonderland" Postage-Stamp-Case]], which was first sold in 1889 by Emberlin and Son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/wonderland-postage-stamp-case-invented-by-lewis-carroll-eight-or-nine-wise-words-about-letter-writing/oclc/559345006 The "Wonderland" Postage-Stamp-Case.

*§1. On Stamp Cases
*§2. How to Begin a Letter
*§3. How to go on with a Letter
*§4. How to end a Letter
*§5. On registering Correspondence

==Nine Rules==
Section 3 "How to go on with a Letter" contains nine rules for letter writing.
*1st Rule. ''Write legibly''.
*2nd Rule. Don't fill ''more'' than a page and a half with apologies for not having written sooner! The best subject, to ''begin'' with, is your friend's last letter.
*3rd Rule. ''Don’t repeat yourself''.
*4th Rule. When you have written a letter that you feel may possibly irritate your friend, however necessary you may have felt it to so express yourself, ''put it aside till the next day''. Then read it over again, and fancy it addressed to yourself.
*5th Rule. If your friend makes a severe remark, either leave it unnoticed, or make your reply distinctly ''less'' severe: and if he makes a friendly remark, tending towards "making up" the little difference that has arisen between you, let your reply be distinctly ''more'' friendly.
*6th Rule. ''Don’t try to have the last word''! 
*7th Rule. If it should ever occur to you to write, jestingly, in ''dispraise'' of your friend, be sure you exaggerate enough to make the jesting ''obvious'': a word spoken in ''jest'', but taken as earnest, may lead to very serious consequences.
*8th Rule. When you say, in your letter, "I enclose cheque for £5," or "I enclose John’s letter for you to see," leave off writing for a moment—go and get the document referred to—and ''put it into the envelope''. Otherwise, you are pretty certain to find it lying about, ''after the Post has gone''!
*9th Rule. When you get to the end of a notesheet, and find you have more to say, take another piece of paper—a whole sheet, or a scrap, as the case may demand: but whatever you do, ''don’t cross''! Remember the old proverb ''[[Crossed letter|Cross-writing]] makes cross reading''.

[[Image:Flora of australia.jpg|right|thumb|180px|The ''Flora of Australia'' Volume 1, second edition. All the book in the series have this distinctive green and yellow cover.]]

The '''''Flora of Australia''''' is a 59 volume series describing the vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens present in Australia and its external territories. The series is published by the [[Australian Biological Resources Study]] who estimate that the series when complete will describe over 20 000 plant species.&lt;ref name = "Orchard" &gt;Orchard, A.

==Series==
Volume 1 of the series was published in 1981, a second extended edition was released in 1999. The series uses the [[Cronquist system]] of taxonomy. The ABRS also published the ''Fungi of Australia'', the ''Algae of Australia'' and  the ''Flora of Australia Supplementary Series''. A new online ''Flora of Australia'' was launched by ABRS in 2017, and no more printed volumes will be published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flora of Australia series|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/books/series/6|website=CSIRO Publishing|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Golan Regiment''' ([[Arabic]]: فوج الجولان, '''Fouj al-Joulan''') is a militia based in [[Khan Arnabah]]&lt;ref name="defection" /&gt; that is part of the [[National Defence Forces (Syria)|National Defence Forces]] (NDF).&lt;ref name="israel" /&gt;  Though primarily active in the [[Golan Heights]], the unit has been deployed in various warzones of western Syria, fighting against many different [[Syrian opposition]] forces and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref name="israel" /&gt; The Golan Regiment is notable insofar as it was the first government unit during the [[Syrian Civil War]] that was founded by [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA) defectors.{{sfnp|Inside Assad's Syria|2015}}&lt;ref name="defection" /&gt;

== History ==
=== Rebellion and return to the government side ===
[[File:Al-Mutasim Battalion formation.png|300px|left|thumb|The al-Mutasim Battalion announces its formation, declaring that it intends to defend the "great revolution" against the "corrupt" Assad government and its "thugs" and "mercenaries".]]

The beginnings of the Golan Regiment trace back to 2011, when its later leader Majid Himoud volunteered for the [[Syrian Army]].{{sfnp|Inside Assad's Syria|2015}} According to Himoud, the officers in his division abused him and other soldiers, whereupon they decided to defect. In December 2011, they formed a [[Free Syrian Army]] unit under Himoud's leadership, the '''al-Mutasim Battalion''', and began to [[Early insurgency phase of the Syrian Civil War|fight against the government]] near the border to [[Israel]]. Allied with other local rebel groups, Himoud's men fought at Jabata, Khan Arnabah, [[Madinat al-Baath]], [[Beer Ajam]], and Breika, and [[Quneitra Governorate clashes (2012–14)|made good progress]] against the government. As time went on, however, Himoud became increasingly dissatisfied with his allies; he later claimed that some groups such as  [[Alwiya al-Furqan]] "wouldn’t even fight, they would come to the battlefield after the clashes had ended, take pictures and videos next to destroyed buildings and tanks, and then send them back to their financiers in [[Jordan]] or the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]] in order to collect their paychecks". Others he accused of closely working with [[Israel]], which he considered a "[[Red line (phrase)|red line]]" Syrians should not cross.&lt;ref name="defection" /&gt;{{efn|name=fn2|When asked about Himoud's claims, the [[Southern Front (Syrian rebel group)|Southern Front]] denied working with Israel, and said that "[Himoud] is an opportunist and a liar. He is a traitor and a regime agent."&lt;ref name="defection" /&gt;}}

These factors led Himoud and many of his men reconsider their role as rebels, and in late 2013 he eventually contacted the mayor of Khan Arnabah, who was his relative&lt;ref name="defection" /&gt; and the NDF commander whose troops he was primarily fighting.{{sfnp|Inside Assad's Syria|2015}} The two agreed to a local ceasefire, and after eight months of negotiations, Himoud and dozens of his fighters handed themselves over to the government. They received an amnesty by president [[Bashar al-Assad]],{{sfnp|Inside Assad's Syria|2015}} and formed the "Golan Regiment" as National Defence Forces unit/[[Popular Committees (Syria)|Popular Committee]],&lt;ref name="popular"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-and-popular-committees-recapture-strategic-hilltop-in-the-golan-heights/|title=Syrian Army and Popular Committees Recapture Strategic Hilltop in the Golan Heights|author=Leith Fadel|publisher=[[al-Masdar News]]|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; centered in [[Khan Arnabah]].&lt;ref name="defection" /&gt; The al-Mutasim Battalion members who disagreed with Himoud's decision and refused to defect instead joined other rebel groups.&lt;ref name="defection" /&gt; Since its foundation, the Golan Regiment has grown by recruiting government loyalists into its ranks,&lt;ref name="defection" /&gt; for example from [[Hader, Quneitra Governorate|Hader]],&lt;ref name="Reconciliation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/free-syrian-army-and-the-syrian-armed-forces-agree-to-reconciliation-talks-in-the-golan-heights/|title=Free Syrian Army and the Syrian Armed Forces Agree to Reconciliation Talks in the Golan Heights|author=Leith Fadel|publisher=[[al-Masdar News]]|date=25 September 2015|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mostly Druze town that is generally considered to be staunchly pro-Assad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/aymenn-jawad-al-tamimi-druze-militias-southern-syria/|title=Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi: More On The Druze Militias in Southern Syria|publisher=Syria Comment|author=Aymenn Al-Tamimi |date=15 November 2015|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October, the [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Jaish al-Haramoun]] alliance and several FSA units launched [[Quneitra offensive (October 2015)|another offensive]] in Quneitra, first attacking Tall Ahmar, which was defended by the Golan Regiment and the Quneitra Hawks Brigade.&lt;ref name="Ahmar" /&gt; After a fierce, two-days long battle, the hill fell into rebel hands and the NDF defenders were forced to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/islamist-rebels-declare-control-of-tal-al-ahmar-in-the-golan-heights/|title=Islamist Rebels Declare Control of Tal Al-Ahmar in the Golan Heights|author=Leith Fadel|publisher=[[al-Masdar News]]|date=4 October 2015|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Golan Regiment, along with other NDF and army units, launched a counter-attack to recapture Tall Ahmar on 7 October,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-and-popular-committees-launch-counter-attack-in-the-golan-heights/|title=Syrian Army and Popular Committees Launch Counter-Attack in the Golan Heights|author=Leith Fadel|publisher=[[al-Masdar News]]|date=7 October 2015|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was repelled.

In late December 2015, the Golan Regiment participated in a government attack on West Al-Samdaniyah, which was captured after hard fighting; soon after its capture, however, the army retreated from the town for unknown reasons, so that it was retaken by rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-withdraws-from-west-al-samdaniyah/|title=Syrian Army withdraws from West Al-Samdaniyah|author=Leith Fadel|publisher=[[al-Masdar News]]|date=24 October 2015|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regiment and other government units once again held reconciliation talks with local FSA rebels in the following January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/reconciliation-talks-begin-in-thr-golan-heights/|title=Reconciliation talks begin in the Golan Heights|author=Leith Fadel|publisher=[[al-Masdar News]]|date=6 January 2016|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, the [[9th Armoured Division (Syria)|9th Armoured Division]]'s 90th Brigade and the Golan Regiment successfully ambushed an al-Nusra Front and [[Ahrar al-Sham]] convoy near the [[Shebaa farms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/islamist-rebels-ambushed-on-the-way-to-the-lebanese-shebaa-farms/|title=Islamist rebels ambushed on the way to the Shebaa Farms|author=Leith Fadel|publisher=[[al-Masdar News]]|date=21 January 2016|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 January, the Golan Regiment helped to repel renewed rebel attacks against the contested hill of Tal Kroum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/islamists-launch-new-offensive-in-southwestern-syria/|title=Islamists launch new offensive in southwestern Syria|author=Leith Fadel|publisher=[[al-Masdar News]]|date=30 January 2016|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Expanded operations 2016–17 ====
Beginning with February 2016, when the unit sent its fighters north to participate in the [[Ithriyah-Raqqa offensive (February–March 2016)|first government offensive]] to retake ISIL-held Al-Tabqa Military Airport,&lt;ref name="zakiyah" /&gt; the Golan Regiment became far more active outside of Quneitra Governorate. Though the aforementioned offensive eventually stalled and was discontinued, the Golan Regiment also aided the [[Palmyra offensive (March 2016)|recapture]] of [[Palmyra]] from ISIL in March.&lt;ref name="pour" /&gt; Later in June, its militiamen were once again involved in [[Ithriyah-Raqqa offensive (June 2016)|another attempt]] by the government to regain Al-Tabqa Military Airport;&lt;ref name="raqqa border" /&gt; which ended in a complete defeat as the pro-government forces were routed by ISIL counter-attacks.

Meanwhile, the Golan Regiment continued its defence of the Hader area. On 6 June the [[Criterion Brigades]] launched an offensive called "At Your Service Darayya" in order to draw government forces from the [[Siege of Darayya and Muadamiyat]] to reinforce the front in [[Quneitra]]. The Brigades allegedly seized 2 villages, which was promptly denied by the Golan Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/NewsReports/567071-quneitra-rebels-aim-to-relieve-siege-of-darayya|title=Quneitra rebels aim to relieve  siege of Darayya|work=NOW.|author=Albin Szakola|date=7 June 2016|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 July, the [[Israel Defense Forces]] attacked the Golan Regiment, launching missiles at the convoy of Majid Himoud and two mortar emplacements of the unit at [[Madinat al-Baath]]. While Himoud survived, the militia denounced Israel for its "[[Zionism|Zionist]]" attacks.&lt;ref name="israel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/israeli-drone-strikes-target-the-national-defense-forces-and-the-pflp-gc/|title=Israeli Drone Strikes Target the National Defense Forces and the PFLP-GC|author=Leith Fadel|publisher=[[al-Masdar News]]|date=29 July 2016|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following September saw a resurgence in the fighting for the Golan Heights, as Jihadist-led rebels launched a [[Quneitra offensive (September 2016)|large-scale offensive]] in the area, with the Golan Regiment once again at the forefront in the defense of Hader.&lt;ref name="golan beat" /&gt; Throughout the battle, the Golan Regiment accused Israel of supporting the Islamist rebels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/israeli-army-returns-14-bodies-jihadist-rebels-golan-heights-offensive/|title=Israeli Army returns 14 bodies to the jihadist rebels after Golan Heights offensive|author=Leith Fadel|publisher=[[al-Masdar News]]|date=14 June 2016|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 17 September, the unit once again became the target of an [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) strike that killed one and wounded 5 of its militiamen. The strike was in retaliation for a stray mortar shell that had hit Israeli territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/israeli-air-force-attacks-syrian-army-golan-heights/|title=Israeli Air Force attacks Syrian Army in the Golan Heights|work=[[Al-Masdar News]]|author=Leith Fadel|date=17 September 2016|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side, the pro-opposition Al-Etihad accused the Golan Regiment of having disguised [[Hezbollah]] fighters in its ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/NewsReports/567345-hezbollah-secretly-deploying-in-quneitra-report|title=Hezbollah "secretly" deploying in Quneitra: report|work=NOW.|author=Albin Szakola|date=9 September 2016|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the rebel offensive was eventually repelled, a later government counter-offensive supported by the Golan Regiment equally yielded no gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-launches-surprise-offensive-golan-heights/|title=Syrian Army launches surprise offensive in Golan Heights|work=[[Al-Masdar News]]|author=Leith Fadel|date=26 September 2016|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, after the [[Syrian Revolutionaries Front]] (SRF)'s branch in [[Jubata al-Khashab]] collapsed amid internal discord, the local SRF commander defected to the Golan Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rubincenter.org/2017/07/israels-relations-with-the-syrian-rebels-an-assessment/|title=Arab Media: Israeli Bombardment Killed, Wounded Targets inside Syria|author=[[Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi]]|editor=[[Jonathan Spyer]]|publisher=Rubin Center|date=3 July 2017|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit spearheaded a government attack in November 2016 that secured the northern part of a strategic highway in the Golan Heights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/latest-battlefield-map-golan-heights/|title=Latest battlefield map of the Golan Heights|work=[[Al-Masdar News]]|author=Leith Fadel|date=24 November 2016|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, the Golan Regiment sent reinforcements to the [[Tiyas Military Airbase]] in an attempt to halt a [[Palmyra offensive (December 2016)|massive ISIL offensive]] in the region.&lt;ref name="Palmyra december" /&gt; On 17 and 26 January 2017, the regiment reportedly helped to repel two rebel attacks in the areas around Hader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13951028000502|title=Syria in Last 24 Hours: Army Wins Back More Strategic Regions Near Ancient Palmyra|author=|publisher=[[Fars News Agency]]|date=17 January 2017|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13951107000693|title=Quneitra: Al-Nusra Front's Base Destroyed, Terrorists' Offensive Repulsed|work=[[Fars News Agency]]|author=|date=26 January 2017|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 March, the Israeli Air Force targeted the Golan Regiment commander Yasser Hussein al-Sayyed{{efn|name=fn1}} with a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] as he was travelling to [[Damascus]] by car. Both he as well as his driver were killed. The attack was seen as Israeli retaliation for the attempt of the [[Syrian Air Defense Force]] to shoot down an IAF jet that had bombarded Hezbollah positions near Palmyra.&lt;ref name="two strikes" /&gt; Meanwhile, the unit also helped countering rebel offensives in [[Qaboun offensive (February–April 2017)#Rebel attack from Jobar|Jobar]] and [[2017 Hama offensive|northern Hama]],&lt;ref name="defection" /&gt; and took part in the operations in the [[Syrian Desert]] in course of which the government again [[Palmyra offensive (2017)|retook Palmyra]] and [[Eastern Homs offensive (2017)|pushed back]] ISIL in eastern [[Homs Governorate]].&lt;ref name="commander killed" /&gt;

On 16 June, a suicide bomber struck Majid Himoud as he was meeting with other Golan Regiment fighters in Khan Arnabah; two members of the unit were killed instantly, while Himoud was wounded and brought to a hospital. There he succumbed to his wounds two days later.&lt;ref name="leader died" /&gt;&lt;ref name="commander killed" /&gt; He was replaced by Khaled Abaza as chief commander of the militia, while Yassin Salibi became the new head of the Golan Regiment's First Battalion.&lt;ref name="national shield"/&gt; Later that month, the Golan Regiment aided the Syrian Army and other pro-government militias in repelling a major [[Quneitra offensive (June 2017)|rebel offensive]] against [[Madinat al-Baath]];&lt;ref name="despite" /&gt; in course of the fighting, the unit was once again bombed by the Israeli Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/middle-east/syria/arab-media-israeli-bombardment-killed-wounded-targets-inside-syria/2017/06/26/|title=Arab Media: Israeli Bombardment Killed, Wounded Targets inside Syria|author=Leith Fadel|publisher=[[The Jewish Press]]|date=26 June 2017|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Golan Regiment helped to repel an [[Tahrir al-Sham]]-led attack on Hader in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/jihadists-launch-new-offensive-golan-heights/|title=Jihadists launch new offensive in Golan Heights |author=Leith Fadel |work=[[al-Masdar News]] |date=8 September 2017 |access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-allies-fully-reverse-al-qaeda-offensive-golan-heights/|title=Syrian Army, allies fully reverse Al-Qaeda offensive in Golan Heights |author=Andrew Illingworth |work=[[al-Masdar News]] |date=8 September 2017 |access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2017, the Golan Regiment relocated much of its forces from other regions of Syria to the Golan Heights in response to rumors about another rebel offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-readies-forces-golan-heights-amid-jihadist-build-israeli-threats/ |title=Syrian Army readies its forces in the Golan Heights amid jihadist build-up, Israeli threats |author=Leith Fadel |work=[[al-Masdar News]] |date=17 August 2017 |access-date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-storms-last-jihadist-bastion-near-occupied-golan-heights/ |title=Syrian Army storms last jihadist bastion near occupied Golan Heights |author=Leith Fadel |work=[[al-Masdar News]] |date=29 November 2017 |access-date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, disputes erupted among the Golan Regiment's leadership. After becoming the new leader of the militia, Khaled Abaza had grown increasingly powerful, having been appointed as head of [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'ath Party]]'s branch in Quneitra Governorate and effectively taking control of Khan Arnabah. He eventually tried to oust Yassin Salibi as leader of the First Battalion, but Yassin found the support of the Quneitra Hawks Brigade and the [[al-Bustan Association]] of pro-government businessman [[Rami Makhlouf]], both of which were wary of Kaled's power. In consequence, the Golan Regiment's Fist Battalion and the Quneitra Hawks Brigade forces in Khan Arnabah, supported by the al-Bustan Association, merged to form the "National Shield of the Patriotic Forces" in December 2017. This new formation was about 1,500 strong and to be led by Mohammed al-Hajj. This development reduced Khaled's control to the Golan Regiment's Second and Third Battalion. The "National Shield" then took part in the [[Beit Jinn offensive]].&lt;ref name="national shield"/&gt; In March 2018, the Golan Regiment and the Quneitra Hawks Brigade occupied Point 99, a hill west of [[Beit Jinn]], as result of the agreement between the government and rebel forces following the Beit Jinn offensive's conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/pictures-syrian-forces-impose-control-over-strategic-height-near-israeli-occupied-golan-amid-preparations-for-new-offensive/ |title=Pictures: Syrian forces impose control over strategic height near Israeli-occupied Golan amid preparations for new offensive |author=Andrew Illingworth |work=[[al-Masdar News]] |date=16 March 2018 |access-date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artillery fire again struck Israeli territory during renwed clashes in Quneitra Governorate in July 2018, whereupon the Israeli military responded by bombarding areas in Al-A'ayyaz near Khan Arnabah that were controlled by the Golan Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almodon.com/arabworld/2018/7/7/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9-%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%84%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B6%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86 |title=القنيطرة:معركة فاشلة للمعارضة..وإسرائيل ترد على مصادر النيران |trans-title=Quneitra: A failed battle for the opposition.

== Organization ==
The Golan Regiment is split into three parts: The "First Battalion" of Khan Arnabah, the "Second Battalion" of [[Hader, Quneitra Governorate|Hader]], and the "Third Battalion" of [[Jaba, Syria|Jaba]]. The founder of the militia, Majid Himoud, served as both chief commander and leader of the First Battalion before his death in June 2017. Thereafter, the militia's overall leader was Khaled Abaza, a [[Circassians in Syria|Circassian]] from [[Beer Ajam]] and the son of [[Brigadier]] Walid Abaza who served as head of the [[Political Security Directorate]]'s branch in [[Hama]] during the [[Islamist uprising in Syria]]. By late 2017, the battalions were led by Yassin Salibi (First), Abu Mashhour (Second), and Abu Suhaib (Third).&lt;ref name="national shield"/&gt; Another notable officer in the Golan Regiment was Yasser Hussein al-Sayyed.{{efn|name=fn1|Al-Sayyed's position within the regiment is disputed.

'''''Goldwater v. Ginzburg''''' was a 1969 United States court ruling on [[defamation]].&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;

==Background==
[[Fact (U.S. magazine)|''Fact'' Magazine]] (''Fact'') was a corporation in New York. The defendant, [[Ralph Ginzburg]], was the editor and publisher of ''Fact'', and [[Warren Boroson]], a co-defendant in this case, was the managing editor of ''Fact''. The plaintiff, [[Barry Goldwater]], was a United States Senator from Arizona and had been [[Barry Goldwater presidential campaign, 1964|a 1964 presidential candidate]]. The defendants testified that they attended the July 1964 Republican National Convention and were not impressed with Senator Goldwater. Thus, they decided to warn the American people in an issue of their magazine (soon known as the "Goldwater issue"&lt;ref name="leagle"&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/1969738414F2d324_1661.xml/GOLDWATER%20v.%20GINZBURG Goldwater v. Ginzburg 414 F.2d 324 (1969)]&lt;/ref&gt; of ''Fact'') immediately after Goldwater's nomination on July 16th. 

The issue at hand was the article published by ''Fact'' titled "The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater" in the September-October 1964 issue. The magazine polled [[psychiatrists]] and asked if Goldwater was psychologically fit to serve as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=LBJ Fit to Serve |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D24hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=F4cFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=882,4721408&amp;dq=ralph+ginzburg&amp;hl=en |quote=Publisher Ralph Ginzburg, defendant in a libel suit for an article on a poll of psychiatrists on Barry Goldwater that he conducted in 1964 says ... |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] |date=May 23, 1968 |accessdate=2011-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fact'' used the information given from the polls in the magazine article against Senator Goldwater. Senator Goldwater sued ''Fact'' Magazine, Inc., Ginzburg, and Boroson for "false, scandalous and defamatory statements referring to and concerning [the] plaintiff.” &lt;ref name="leagle" /&gt;

==Court rulings==
The court found that the evidence introduced at trial proved the defendants knew they were publishing defamatory statements and “were motivated by actual malice when they published the statements.”&lt;ref name="leagle" /&gt; The court found the defendants guilty of libel action based on the article ''Fact'' published. The plaintiff demanded $1,000,000 in compensatory and punitive damages but Senator Goldwater was awarded $1 in compensatory damages and $75,000 in punitive damages. The compensatory damages were against all defendants but the punitive damages were split between the defendants. Ginzburg and Boroson were liable for $25,000 of the $75,000 and ''Fact'' Magazine, Inc. was liable for $50,000. The United States Court of Appeals affirmed the award and the Supreme Court denied a petition for ''certiorari'' (review); [[Hugo Black|Justice Black]] and [[William O. Douglas|Justice Douglas]] joined a dissenting opinion, rather unusual at the time (1970) on orders denying “cert.”&lt;ref&gt;414 F.2d 324, 337 (2d Cir.1969), cert. denied, 396 US 1049, 90 S.Ct. 701, 24 L.Ed.2d 695.&lt;/ref&gt; Boroson was the only defendant not to file an appeal after receiving the ruling.

==Commentary==
Although over 1,800 psychiatrists responded to the polls sent by Ginzburg, the medical director{{ambiguous|date=August 2017}} at the time, Walter Barton, sent a protest warning Ginzburg that "a psychiatrist’s evaluation must take place in the context of a doctor-patient relationship and a “thorough clinical examination"."&lt;ref name="psychiatryonline"&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.14111410 "Goldwater v. Ginzburg." American Journal of Psychiatry, 172(8), pp. 729–730]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Psychiatric Association]] then issued the [[Goldwater rule]] reaffirming [[medical privacy]] and forbidding commenting on a patient that any individual psychiatrist has not personally examined.&lt;ref name=tele&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Richard A. Friedman]] |coauthors= |title=How a Telescopic Lens Muddles Psychiatric Insights |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/health/views/24mind.html?ref=science |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=May 23, 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interference Archive''' is a volunteer-run [[library]], [[art gallery|gallery]], and [[archive]] of [[historical document|historical materials]] related to [[social activism|social]] and [[political activism]] and [[social movement|movements]]. It is located in the [[Park Slope]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].

==History==

Interference Archive began as the personal collection of [[Josh MacPhee]] and [[Dara Greenwald]], [[activist]]s who told the ''[[New York Times]]'' that they had filled their home with so much "social movement memorabilia ... Ph.D. students would visit to conduct research."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=ifla/&gt;&lt;ref name=reframe/&gt; The idea to turn it into a public resource began in 2008 when the couple was asked to curate an exhibition at the [[Exit Art]] gallery in [[Manhattan]]. Using the title "Signs of Change," it showcased cultural artifacts produced by those engaged with groups organizing to foment change.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=rail/&gt;&lt;ref name=signsflickr/&gt; The show and research they did in preparation for it is reflected in the Interference Archive mission statement which begins, "Interference Archive explores the relationship between cultural production and social movements."&lt;ref name=mission/&gt; MacPhee and Greenwald also point to archives and libraries of similar scope and purpose as inspiration, including another Brooklyn-based organization, the [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]].&lt;ref name=juice/&gt;

In 2010 MacPhee and Greenwald moved their collection to a warehouse in [[Gowanus]], in collaboration with activists and artists Molly Fair and Kevin Caplicki. Greenwald named it Interference Archive, referring to "the idea that the collection causes static, or interference, in institutional archives and in the larger society."&lt;ref name=rail/&gt;&lt;ref name=juice/&gt;&lt;ref name=obscura/&gt; It opened its doors to the public in December 2011 with a [[punk subculture|punk]] and [[feminism]] themed exhibition in tribute to Greenwald, who had been struggling with [[endometrial cancer]] and died the following month.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=rail/&gt; 
[[File:Interference Archive.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the Interference Archive's location in [[Park Slope, Brooklyn]]]]

The rising prominence and popularity of the [[Occupy movement]] emerged as one specific motivation around the time of the Archive's opening, when its founders observed among Occupy participants a need for information about social movements of the past.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=aiga/&gt;

Interference Archive has broadened its activities significantly since opening, operating as a library and community space and hosting regular talks, art exhibitions, performances, workshops, and other events. 

''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Edward Helmore, assessing the place of the Archive among other arts institutions, described it as "far removed from the realm of commercial art galleries, oligarch collectors, the show-palace museums of billionaire real estate developers, and under the watch of gun-toting revolutionaries from several decades back &amp;mdash; and is far the richer for it."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

{{as of|2014}} it operates on a yearly budget of less than $25,000, supported primarily by donations from a community of financial sustainers.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

In October 2017, after being evicted from their space in Gowanus, the archive relocated to the nearby [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]] neighborhood of Brooklyn and reopened to the public in December 2017.&lt;ref name=aiga/&gt; The inaugural exhibit in the new space entitled ''no. NOT EVER'' opened in January 2018. The exhibit is a multidisciplinary and video-based exploration of "the rise of white nationalism" in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=no. NOT EVER. at Interference Archive|url=http://interferencearchive.org/no-not-ever/|website=Interference Archive Events|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archive is housed in an open floor-plan storefront space, filled to the ceiling.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; The collection includes a number of different kinds of media artifacts which provide information and illustration about the histories of radical political movements around the world, with 40% of the archive coming from outside the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=juice/&gt; Among the materials are [[poster]]s, [[flyer (pamphlet)|fliers]], [[pamphlet]]s, [[zine]]s, [[sticker]]s, [[T-shirt]]s, [[book]]s, [[graphic novel]]s, [[newspaper]]s, [[game]]s, [[video]]s, [[leaflet (information)|leaflets]], [[Button (clothing)|button]]s, [[audio recording]]s, and other [[ephemera]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=rail/&gt;&lt;ref name=mission/&gt; The topics it covers includes [[ACT-UP]], [[Occupy Wall Street]], [[Arab Spring]], [[Code Pink]], [[Pink Bloque]], [[Rock for Choice]], [[Latin American art]], [[nature]], [[ecology]], [[feminism]], [[punk rock]], [[criminal justice]], [[prison reform]], [[apartheid]], [[anti-nuclear movement]], [[squatting]], [[Anarchist Bookfair|anarchist bookfairs]], [[May 1968 events in France]], and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[anti-fur]] activism.&lt;ref name=rail/&gt;&lt;ref name=juice/&gt;&lt;ref name=blouin/&gt;

MacPhee summarizes the conceptual basis for the collection as "material produced by people organizing to transform the world".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

The owners and volunteers take a pointedly nontraditional approach to [[archivism]]. In selection and acquisition, no priority is given to particular movements, media types, or well-known artists.&lt;ref name=rail/&gt; Instead, it positions itself as a [[commons]] where people can share what they have and benefit from what was donated by others.&lt;ref name=rail/&gt;&lt;ref name=juice/&gt; Whereas most archives stress materials protection and preservation, the Interference Archive promotes access, physical engagement, and use of the materials to maintain their continued relevance outside of the Archive.&lt;ref name=rail/&gt;&lt;ref name=aiga/&gt; Collections are also organized for usability, prioritizing media type and subject over donation or donor.&lt;ref name=aiga/&gt;

==Events and activities==

In addition to its primary purpose as an archive and library, Interference Archive also functions as a multipurpose community center, gallery, and events space.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=rail/&gt; Past events and exhibitions have covered prison reform,&lt;ref name=dailynews/&gt;&lt;ref name=hyperallergic/&gt; the [[Asian American movement]] in New York,&lt;ref name=scmp/&gt;&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt; underground newspapers,&lt;ref name=kommersant/&gt; the anti-nuclear movement,&lt;ref name=nycarchivists/&gt; and [[Art+Feminism]] [[edit-a-thon]]s.&lt;ref name=newyorkerlavin/&gt;

''Armed by Design'', a 2015 exhibition, comprised graphic art from ''[[Tricontinental]]'', a magazine published by the Cuba-based [[anti-globalization]], [[anti-imperialist]], [[anticapitalist]] organization OSPAAL ([[Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America]]). ''[[The Guardian]]'' described it as "a fascinating tour of 60s and 70s radical politics and its heroes".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

In addition to historical materials and preexisting cultural products, the Archive occasionally commissions artists to produce original work. For ''Armed by Design'', the 60s and 70s graphics were supplemented by a new set of topical posters.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Another exhibit, ''if a song could be freedom... Organized Sounds of Resistance'', included a series of annotated mixtapes compiled by musicians, historians, and activists.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

One exhibit in April 2013 featured "book blocs", home-made [[cardboard]] [[shield]]s glued together by activists for use during [[college tuition]] protests.&lt;ref name=newyorkerbarliant/&gt; The shields on display as well as others made during a workshop earlier in the month were confiscated as weapons by the [[New York Police Department]] the day before they were due to be used at [[Cooper Union]] in a protest against the school's decision to begin charging tuition.&lt;ref name=newyorkerbarliant/&gt;&lt;ref name=6thfloor/&gt;

Since 2015, volunteers have hosted a [[podcast]] which highlights material in the collections and associated exhibits.&lt;ref name=aiga/&gt;

The '''J. Paul Getty Museum''', commonly referred to as '''the Getty''', is an [[art museum]] in [[California]] housed on two campuses: the [[Getty Center]] and [[Getty Villa]]. The two locations received over two million visitors in 2016.&lt;ref name=visitors/&gt;

The primary museum, the Getty Center, is located in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], on a hill top above the west side of the [[Sepulveda Pass]] and [[Interstate 405 (California)|I-405]] freeway.  Its collection features Western art from the [[Middle Ages]] to the present. 

The secondary museum, the Getty Villa, is in the Malibu neighborhood and displays art from [[Ancient Greece]], [[Rome]], and [[Etruria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getty.edu/visit/ |title=Visit the Getty |publisher=Getty.edu |date= |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1974, [[J. Paul Getty]] opened a museum in a re-creation of the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]] on his property in [[Malibu, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE GETTY VILLA TO OPEN JANUARY 28, 2006|url=http://www.getty.edu/news/press/center/villa_ticketing_release.html|work=Press Release|publisher=J. Paul Getty Trust|accessdate=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the museum became the richest in the world when it inherited US$1.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DD133DF937A35750C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Getty, The Art World's Big Spender | first=Douglas C. | last=McGill | date=March 4, 1987 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, after an economic downturn in what was then [[West Germany]], the Getty Museum acquired 144 [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated medieval manuscripts]] from the financially struggling Ludwig Collection in Aachen; [[John Russell (art critic)|John Russell]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', said of the collection, "One of the finest holdings of its kind ever assembled, it is quite certainly the most important that was in private hands."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Pace (July 23, 1996), [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/23/arts/peter-ludwig-71-german-art-collector-dies.html Peter Ludwig, 71, German Art Collector, Dies] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the museum moved to its current location in the [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood]] neighborhood of Los Angeles; the Malibu museum, renamed the "[[Getty Villa]]", was renovated and reopened in 2006.

Paul Getty Museum|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== The controversies with Italy and Greece ==
In the 1970s and 1980s, the curator, [[Jiří Frel]], designed a tax manipulation scheme which expanded the museum collection of antiquities, essentially buying artifacts of dubious provenance, as well as a number of artifacts generally considered fakes, such as the [[Getty kouros]]. In 1984, Frel was demoted, and in 1986, he resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/13/local/me-frel13|title=Jiri Frel, 82; Colorful Curator Who Left Getty Under a Cloud|last=Frammolino|first=Ralph|date=13 May 2006|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Getty is involved in a controversy regarding proper title to some of the artwork in its collection. The museum's previous curator of [[antiquities]], [[Marion True]] (hired by Frel), was indicted in Italy in 2005 (along with famed dealer [[Robert E. Hecht]]) on criminal charges relating to trafficking in stolen antiquities. Similar charges have been addressed by the Greek authorities. The primary evidence in the case came from the 1995 raid of a [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], warehouse which had contained a fortune in stolen artifacts. Italian art dealer [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]] was arrested in 1997; his operation was thought to be "one of the largest and most sophisticated antiquities networks in the world, responsible for illegally digging up and spiriting away thousands of top-drawer pieces and passing them on to the most elite end of the international art market".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Men's Vogue]]'', Nov/Dec 2006, Vol. 2, No. 3, pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 True was forced to tender her resignation by the Board of Trustees, which announced her early retirement. Italy allowed the statute of limitations of the charges filed against her to expire in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Felch, Jason and Ralph Frammolino (2011), ''Chasing Aphrodite: The Hunt for Looted Antiquities at the World's Richest Museum''. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, pp. 265–66, 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]] on December 18, 2006, True stated that she was being made to "carry the burden" for practices which were known, approved, and condoned by the Getty's Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Getty lets her take fall, ex-curator says | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-true29dec29,0,3427365.story?coll=la-home-headlines | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | first1=Jason | last1=Felch | first2=Ralph | last2=Frammolino | date=December 29, 2006 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; True is currently under investigation by Greek authorities over the acquisition of a 2,500-year-old funerary wreath. The wreath, along with a 6th-century BC statue of a woman, have been returned to Greece and are exhibited at the [[Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = $1.5 mn Macedonian Gold Wreath Attracts Greek Populace | publisher = elitechoice.org | date = March 30, 2007 | url = http://www.elitechoice.org/2007/11/23/15-mn-macedonian-gold-wreath-attracts-greek-populace/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, 2006, the director of the museum, [[Michael Brand]], announced that 26 disputed pieces were to be returned to Italy, but not the [[Victorious Youth]], which is still claimed by the Italian authorities. In 2007, the Los Angeles J. Paul Getty Museum was forced to return 40 artifacts, including a 5th-century BC statue of the goddess [[Aphrodite]], which was looted from [[Morgantina]], an ancient Greek settlement in Sicily.&lt;ref name="ariel"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ariel | first = David | title = Getty to Return Antiquities to Italy | work = [[Forbes]] | date = August 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Getty Museum resisted the requests of the Italian government for nearly two decades, only to admit later that "there might be 'problems'" attached to the acquisition."&lt;ref name="povoledo"&gt;{{cite news | last = Povoledo | first = Elisabetta | title = In a Tug of War, Ancient Statue Is Symbol of Patrimony | work = The New York Times | date = July 4, 2007 | url = http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/07/04/arts/design/04dig.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Italian senior cultural official Giuseppe Proietti said: "The negotiations haven't made a single step forward." Only after he suggested the Italian government "to take cultural sanctions against the Getty, suspending all cultural cooperation,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Getty will return Aphrodite statue if it has origins in Italy | work = [[North County Times]] | date = November 22, 2006 | url = http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2006/11/22/entertainment/art/12_04_5011_22_06.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; did the J. Paul Getty Museum return the antiquities.

In another unrelated case in 1999, the Getty Museum had to hand over three antiquities to Italy after determining they were stolen. The objects included a Greek red-figure [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] from the 5th-century BC, signed by the painter [[Onesimos (vase painter)|Onesimos]] and the potter Euphronios as potter, looted from the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] site of [[Cerveteri]]; a torso of the god [[Mithra]] from the 2nd-century AD, and the head of a youth by the Greek sculptor [[Polykleitos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Slayman | first = Andrew | title = Getty Returns Italian Artifacts | journal = Archaeology | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | date = May–June 1999 | url = http://www.archaeology.org/9905/newsbriefs/getty.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the terracotta head of the Greek god [[Hades]] was returned to [[Sicily]] ([[Italy]]). The archaeological artifact was looted from [[Morgantina]] in the 1970s.  The Getty museum purchased the terracotta head of Hades in 1985 from the New York collector Maurice Tempelsman, who had purchased it from the London dealer Robin Symes. Getty records show the museum paid $530,000 for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Getty Museum to return Hades terracotta head to Sicily|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/10/entertainment/la-et-cm-getty-museum-hades-sculpture-sicily-20130110|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Los Angeles - Head of Hades returned to Italy|url=http://www.esteri.it/mae/en/sala_stampa/archivionotizie/approfondimenti/2016/01/los-angeles-restituisce-all-italia.html|website=Farnesina|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 2016, the head of Hades was added to the collection of the archaeological museum of [[Aidone]], where it joined the statue of [[Demeter]], the mother of his consort [[Persephone]]. Sicilian archaeologists found a blue curl that was missing from Hades' beard, and so it proved the origin of the terracotta head.

'''Jay Seth Rosenblatt''' (November 18, 1923 – February 16, 2014) was emeritus professor of psychology at [[Rutgers–Newark|Rutgers University-Newark]]. At the time of his retirement in 2005, he was the [[Daniel S. Lehrman]] Professor of Psychobiology. He was a, painter, and psychotherapist, and most notably a scientist.  His scientific research largely established the study of neonate learning and especially mother-offsping behavior throughout the maternal cycle.  For the latter work, he was known in [[developmental psychobiology]] as the "father of mothering".  He received several honors and awards during his career including election to [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].

==Biography==

===Personal===
Rosenblatt was born in the [[East Bronx]], which is part of [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the youngest of three children. His mother, a housewife, immigrated from [[Russia]] to flee from the [[pogrom]]s of the early 20th century; his father, a [[Fur clothing#Processing of fur|furrier]], arrived from [[Austria]] as a teenager.&lt;ref name=Fleming&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fleming|first1=Alison S.|title=The Three Faces of Jay S.

In high school, the [[Works Progress Administration]] allowed him to study art and especially painting. During [[World War II]] he was a [[camouflage]] artist and he continued to paint the rest of his life. He married Gilda Rosenblatt (née Rosen) who died in 1999.  He then married Pat Rosenblatt.  He had two children Daniel and Nina.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

===Academic===
In 1946, after the army, Rosenblatt entered [[New York University]]. There he met [[T. C. Schneirla]] who influenced the direction his scientific interests and research would take.&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;  Schneirla convinced Rosenblatt that the study of animal behavior would broaden his understanding of human behavior and that it was interesting in itself.&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;  He began his research on the role of hormones and experience on the sexual behavior of male cats.&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt; Supported by Schneirla, he began his doctoral work in 1958 at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] study of early learning in kittens.  He discovered that kittens could orient to home by 3 to 4 days of age and that they formed nipple attachment preferences by 1 to 2 days of age.  This was contrary to learning paradigms of that time, which assumed that animals could not learn at very young ages.&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;&lt;ref name="Father of Mothering"/&gt;
In the 1950s, while an assistant professor at the [[City College of New York]], he became a person of interest for the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], which was conveyed to the City College of New York.&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;  Subsequently, his contract was not renewed he went to Rutgers University at Newark where he joined the Institute of Animal Behavior the Institute of Animal Behavior founded by [[Daniel S. Lehrman]] who he had been friends with during graduate school.&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;&lt;ref name=Capizzi&gt;{{cite news |last1=Capizzi |first1=Carla |title=Groundbreaking Rutgers University-Newark Psychologist Jay Rosenblatt Dies at 90; Pioneered Research in Maternal Behavior, Learning Processes |url=http://news.rutgers.edu/news-release/groundbreaking-rutgers-university-newark-psychologist-jay-rosenblatt-dies-90-pioneered-research/20140218#.U6Tz1F64lSU |accessdate=21 June 2014 |publisher=[[Rutgers University-Newark]] |date=18 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QUE6STP5?url=http://news.rutgers.edu/news-release/groundbreaking-rutgers-university-newark-psychologist-jay-rosenblatt-dies-90-pioneered-research/20140218 |archivedate=21 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, he became director of the Institute of Animal Behavior at Rutgers University-Campus at Newark by unanimous vote after the death it founder Daniel S. Lehrman and remained its director for more than 17 years.&lt;ref name=Komisaruk/&gt;&lt;ref name="Father of Mothering"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Annals/&gt; He served as dean of the Graduate School of Rutgers University-Newark.&lt;ref name=Komisaruk/&gt;&lt;ref name=Capizzi/&gt; He also served as editor for Advance in the Study of Behavior for more than 10 years.&lt;ref name=Capizzi/&gt; In 2005, he retired as Daniel S.

He was viewed as a successful mentor by those who knew him:&lt;ref name=Komisaruk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harold I. Siegel|last2=Alison S. Fleming|last3=[[Robert Hinde]]|last4=Robert J.

==Painter==
[[File:Mother and older Child.png|thumb|right|"Mother and older Child" a painting by Jay S. Rosenblatt]]
As a teenager, Rosenblatt apprenticed in the studio of Ben Wilson under the Works in Progress Administration. Wilson had a major impact on him, Rosenblatt would later say of Wilson "I saw that he was thoughtful and deeply sincere in his work and that he would be supportive of my becoming a painter."&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt; He would keep in contact with Wilson for 63 years until Wilson died in 2005. Rosenblatt's painting was influenced not only by Wilson but also by painters such as [[Georges Braque]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Pablo Picasso]].  The content of his paintings was influenced by [[Judaism]] and [[Marxism]].  Many of his paintings were political focusing on war and [[The Holocaust]]. Another major theme of his paintings were of mothers and their children, which would mirror his scientific interest in maternal behavior as a scientist.  For example, in his painting "Mother and older Child," both of his subjective and scientific perspectives of mother-child relationships are expressed, evoking both discomfort and comfort in the viewer.&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt; He never became a professional painter, but [[Rutgers University]] held a show in the late 1990s for 56 of his paintings.&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;

==Psychoanalysis and clinical psychologist ==
Rosenblatt met psychoanalyst Max Hertzman while he was a teaching assistant at [[City College of New York]]. He was interested in psychoanalysis because he wanted to understand better "intrapsychic events" in himself and his clients.&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;  He also wanted to find out if psychology as he understood it could be applied to real people, which led him to take a job at the Pediatric Psychiatry Clinic at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital.  There he diagnosed children with emotional and psychological disorders.  He discovered that his formal training in psychology helped him to understand the children he diagnosed.&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;

==Scientist==
Rosenblatt's research in [[developmental psychobiology]] focused on early neonate learning and maternal behavior.  It explored these processes using multiple levels of analysis, using multiple techniques, and from multiple perspectives (i.e., proximal, functional, comparative, and evolutionary).&lt;ref name="Father of Mothering"/&gt;

===Neonate learning===
In the 1960s, Rosenblatt experimentally demonstrated that learning in newly born animals occurred earlier than had been thought possible (see Rosenblatt, Turkewitz, and Schneirla, 1969).&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;  His early work with kittens showed that early learning in neonates initially involved single sensory modalities such as tactile, thermal, and olfactory sensory modalities.  As development proceeded these sensory modalities are integrated and learning becomes multimodal.  His early work with kittens demonstrated these developmental processes of early learning and set the stage for a new field of research that focuses on neonatal learning in naturalistic contexts (see Rosenblatt, 1971; Rosenblatt, Turkewitz, and Schneirla, 1969).&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;&lt;ref name="Father of Mothering"/&gt;

The discovery of early learning in neonates was, according to Rosenblatt, serendipitous.&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;&lt;ref name="Father of Mothering"/&gt; It occurred while he was studying cats in the 1950s and when he was weighing kittens on a daily basis.  He noticed that when he returned the kittens to their home environment (without their mother present), they returned to their home corner faster and faster each day.  The kittens' eyes had not yet opened during this time and so they were blind to any visual stimuli.  The only way they could find the corner they had been in is by learning the olfactory characteristics of that area in their home environment where they had been nursed (see Rosenblatt, 1983; Rosenblatt, Turkewitz, and Schneirla, 1969).&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;&lt;ref name="Father of Mothering"/&gt;

===Maternal behavior===
He did his seminal work on maternal behavior during the late 1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Father of Mothering"/&gt; This work consisted of two major themes: behavioral transitions in maternal cyclic patterns of behavior and the coupling of mother-offspring behavior during these maternal cycles (Rosenblatt, 1970).&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;&lt;ref name="Father of Mothering"/&gt;  His work on maternal behavior, starting in the 1960s, focused primarily on the rat as an animal model.  He identified three important phases in 
maternal cyclic patterns of behavior: the first phase spans conception through most of pregnancy, the second begins towards the end of pregnancy and continues through birth, and the third is the maintenance phase, which extends from the postpartum phase to weaning.&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;&lt;ref name="Father of Mothering"/&gt;  He began his research by describing the phenomena associated with each of these phases of the mother-offspring cyclic patterns of behavior.  His studies also determined the role of sensory factors in mother and offspring behavior.  He investigated physiological, hormonal, and affective mechanisms and their feedback in maternal and offspring cyclic patterns of behavior (Rosenblatt, 1980).&lt;ref name=Fleming/&gt;  It is because of Rosenblatt's early study of maternal behavior, the coupling of mother-offspring behavior, and his conceptualization of these behavioral processes as occurring in phases that he is often called "father of mothering" or "father of maternal behavior" within the field of psychobiology.&lt;ref name=Komisaruk/&gt;&lt;ref name="Father of Mothering"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Capizzi/&gt;

Rosenblatt's 1967 study of the induction of maternal behavior is consider by many in his field to be his most famous study.&lt;ref name="Father of Mothering"/&gt; In that study he showed that the neural basis of parental care is independent of pregnancy and birth.&lt;ref name="Father of Mothering"/&gt; He found that he could induce maternal behavior in virgin female rats during a 6 to 8 day period by continuously exposing them to rat pups.&lt;ref name="Father of Mothering"/&gt; He also found that female rats that were ovariectomized or hypophysectomized could also be induced to exhibit maternal behavior via the continuous exposure to rat pups.  Although the hormonal and physiological processes that occur during pregnancy and birth enhance maternal behavior, maternal behavior has an already developed neural basis in the brain.&lt;ref name="Father of Mothering"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4092">The '''Kozak Memorandum''', officially '''Russian Draft Memorandum on the Basic Principles of the State Structure of a United State in Moldova''', was a 2003 proposal aimed at a final settlement of relations between [[Moldova]] and [[Transnistria]]. It was seen as an extension of the [[1997 Moscow Memorandum]] but was ultimately rejected by Moldovan president [[Vladimir Voronin]].

The plan, presented in mid-November 2003 by [[Russia]], was a detailed proposal for a united ''asymmetric'' federal Moldavian state. First published in Russian on the website of Transnistria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the text was promoted by a Russian politician [[Dmitry Kozak]], close ally of President [[Vladimir Putin]] and one of the key figures in his presidential team. For Transnistria, the memorandum presented an end to the previous Moscow policy, which assumed that the region would have equal status in federation with the rest of the country. According to the memorandum Russian troops (no more than 2000 strong, without heavy armaments) would remain in Transnistria for the transitional period but not later than 2020.

It was proposed that the competences of government of the federal Moldova would be divided into three categories: those of the federation, those of individual subjects and those of joint competences. The plan presented several issues risking to cause blockage in policy-making.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} A lower house, elected by proportional representation, would pass legislation by simple majority. All organic laws (pertaining to the change of the federal power structure - section 7b) would need the assent of the senate (not "all laws"), however, whose representation would be disproportionate with respect to population figures: 13 senators elected by the federal lower house, nine by Transnistria and four by [[Gagauzia]]. By 2004  Transnistria had 14% and Gagauzia 4% of Moldova's total population. By this plan, Transnistrian senators would be able to block changes to the constitution of the unified state.  Laws concerning the Federation (Moldova excluding Transnistria and Gagauzia) would not need ratification by the Senate.

Large demonstrations against the Kozak memorandum took place in [[Chişinău]] in the days following the publication of the Russian proposal. Moldova's leadership declined to sign memorandum without coordination with the European organizations. A visit by President Putin to Moldova was canceled. Later in 2005, President Vladimir Voronin made a statement rejecting the 2003 Kozak memorandum because of contradiction with the Moldovan constitution which defines Moldova as a neutral state and could not allow any foreign troops on its soil, while the country cannot join military alliances. Moldova and the Kozak memorandum was a key issue at the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] ministerial meeting in [[Maastricht]] in December 2003, and disagreement between Russia on the one hand, and the EU and the US on the other on Moldova, was one of the principal reasons why a final joint declaration was not adopted after the meeting.

'''''Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten''''', 244 [[Federal Reporter|F.]] 535 ([[S.D.N.Y.]] 1917), was a decision by the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], that addressed advocacy of illegal activity under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

==Background==
In cases such as ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'', 250 U.S. 616 (1919) and ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'', 268 U.S. 652 (1925) and others, the [[United States Supreme Court]] struggled to draw the line between politically unpopular speech and actual threats to national security.  ''Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten'' greatly influenced the Supreme Court's eventual adoption in ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' of the "incitement test" for advocacy of illegal activity.

At issue in ''Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten'' was the federal [[Espionage Act of 1917]], which prohibited citizens from counseling or advising violation of the law.  The Court found that the New York postmaster's refusal to allow circulation of the antiwar journal ''[[The Masses]]'' under the statute violated the First Amendment.

===Opinion===
[[Learned Hand]] wrote the opinion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To assimilate agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to violent resistance, is to disregard the tolerance of all methods of political agitation which in normal times is a safeguard of free government.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Judge Hand affirmed that if a citizen "stops short of urging upon others that it is their duty or their interest to resist the law," then he or she is protected by the First Amendment. One may, for example, "admire" resistors of the draft, but may not, under the "incitement" test, "counsel or advise" someone to violate the law at a specific time and place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25493">'''United States Objectives and Programs for National Security''', better known as '''NSC{{nbsp}}68''', was a 66-page top secret [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) [[National security directive#Truman and Eisenhower administrations|policy paper]] drafted by the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] and [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and presented to President [[Harry S. Truman]] on 7 April 1950. It was one of the most important American policy statements of the [[Cold War]]. In the words of scholar [[Ernest May (historian)|Ernest R. May]], NSC{{nbsp}}68 "provided the blueprint for the militarization of the Cold War from 1950 to the collapse of the Soviet Union at the beginning of the 1990s." NSC{{nbsp}}68 and its subsequent amplifications advocated a large expansion in the military budget of the United States, the development of a [[hydrogen bomb]], and increased military aid to allies of the United States. It made the [[rollback]] of global Communist expansion a high priority. NSC{{nbsp}}68 rejected the alternative policies of friendly [[détente]] and [[containment]] of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Walter L. Hixson, "What Was the Cold War and How Did We Win It?" ''Reviews in American History'' (1994) 22#3 pp. 507-511 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2703029 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
By 1950, events dictated the need to examine U.S. national security policies: the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) was operational; military assistance for European allies had begun; the Soviet Union had detonated an atomic bomb and the communists had solidified their control of [[China]].  In addition, a British sterling-dollar crisis in the summer of 1949 had brought home to U.S. officials that the [[Marshall Plan]] would not suffice to cure Western European economic ills by 1952, the Plan's scheduled end year, with the prospect that Western Europe would have no choice but to pursue [[autarky]], as it had in the 1930s, with all the attendant difficulties that would pose for the world economy generally and the U.S. economy particularly.&lt;ref&gt;Curt Cardwell, ''NSC 68 and the Political Economy of the Early Cold War'' (Cambridge, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Similar problems were also plaguing Japan.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Borden, ''The Pacific Alliance: United States Foreign Economic Policy and Japanese Trade policy, 1947-1955'' (Wisconsin, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;   With these threats to the U.S. and its allies expanding, on 31 January 1950 President Truman directed the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] and [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] "to undertake a reexamination of our objectives in peace and war and of the effect of these objectives on our strategic plans."  A State-Defense Policy Review Group was set up under the chairmanship of [[Paul Nitze]] of the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;Paul H Nitze, S Nelson Drew, Ed., ''NSC-68: Forging the Strategy of Containment'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=K3XsqKRkjlUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=NSC-68#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Brief%20Chronology%22&amp;f=false Brief Chronology], pp. 17–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Defense Department representatives on the committee initially resisted proposals that would exceed the existing $12.5 billion ceiling on defense spending.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Fred L. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=_i153pbikldjfcoC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=nsc-68&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1947&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=1980&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=MP3YS4OgLp7-zQSpkcWMCQ&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=nsc-68&amp;f=false  The Origins of International...]" Google Books. 28 April 2010. Web. 29 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report, designated NSC{{nbsp}}68, was presented to President Truman on 7 April 1950, who passed it on to the NSC for further consideration on 12 April 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Paul H Nitze, S Nelson Drew, Ed., ''NSC-68: Forging the Strategy of Containment'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=K3XsqKRkjlUC&amp;pg=PA18 Brief Chronology], pp. 17–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NSC Study Group:'''
* [[Paul Nitze]], Chair
* John P. Davis
* Robert Tufts
* Robert Hooker
* [[Dean Acheson]]
* [[Charles E. Bohlen]]
* Major General [[Truman Landon]], Joint Chiefs Representative
* Samuel S. Butano
* Robert Lovett, Deputy Secretary of Defense
Originally, President Truman did not support NSC{{nbsp}}68 when it was brought to him in 1950. He believed that it was not specific about which programs would be affected or changed and it also didn't go well with his previous defense spending limits. Truman sent it back for further review until he finally approved it in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul H. Nitze]], S. Nelson Drew, Ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=K3XsqKRkjlUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=NSC-68#PPP1,M1 ''NCS-68: Forging the Strategy of Containment''], p. 6, National Defense University, Washington DC: 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The document outlined the de facto national security strategy of the United States for that time (though it was not an official NSS in the form we know today) and analyzed the capabilities of the [[Soviet Union]] and of the United States of America from military, economic, political, and psychological standpoints.

NSC{{nbsp}}68 described the challenges facing the United States in cataclysmic terms. "The issues that face us are momentous," the document stated, "involving the fulfillment or destruction not only of this Republic but of civilization itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Andrea and James Overfield, eds.|title=The Human Record: Sources of Global History, Volume II: Since 1500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mK5_5l0pYkAC&amp;pg=PA473|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|pages=471–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and meaning==
NSC{{nbsp}}68 saw the goals and aims of the United States as sound, yet poorly implemented, calling "present programs and plans... dangerously inadequate".&lt;ref name="NSC 68"&gt;[https://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/coldwar/documents/pdf/10-1.pdf "United States Objectives and Programs for National Security - NSC 68"], 14 April 1950. President's Secretary's File, Truman Papers.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[George F. Kennan]]'s theory of containment articulated a multifaceted approach for U.S. foreign policy in response to the perceived Soviet threat, the report recommended policies that emphasized military over diplomatic action. [[X Article|Kennan's influential 1947 "X" article]] advocated a policy of [[containment]] towards the Soviet Union. It described containment as "a policy of calculated and gradual coercion" and called for significant peacetime military spending, in which the U.S. possessed "superior overall power" "in dependable combination with other like-minded nations." In particular, it called for a military capable of
* Defending the Western Hemisphere and essential allied areas so that their war-making capabilities can be developed;
* Providing and protecting a mobilization base while the offensive forces required for victory were being built up;
* Conducting offensive operations to destroy vital elements of the Soviet war-making capacity, and to keep the enemy off balance until the full offensive strength of the United States and its allies can be brought to bear;
* Defending and maintaining the lines of communication and base areas necessary to the execution of the above tasks; and
* Providing such aid to allies is as essential to the execution of their role in the above tasks.

NSC{{nbsp}}68 itself did not contain any specific cost estimates at a time when the United States was committing six to seven percent of its GNP to defense. It was evident that the limits the President had previously set on defense spending were too low.  The report called for tripling defense spending to $40 or $50 billion per year from the original $13 billion set for 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowie|first1=Robert R.|last2=Immerman|first2=Richard H.|title=Waging Peace: How Eisenhower Shaped an Enduring Cold War Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPHLOOMDP0UC&amp;pg=PA17|year=2000|publisher=Oxford UP|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It specified a reduction of taxes and a "reduction of Federal expenditures for purposes other than defense and foreign assistance, if necessary by the deferment of certain desirable programs",&lt;ref name="NSC 68"/&gt; as a means for paying for it. However, several officials involved in the preparation of the study, including the future chairman of the president's [[Council of Economic Relations]] [[Leon Keyserling]], suggested that the massive increase in military spending could be afforded by deliberate acceptance of government deficits, which would have the added benefit of energising and stimulating parts of the American economy, as it did after 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Campbell., Logevall, F. (2012). ''America's Cold War: The Politics of Insecurity''. Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, pp.113-114&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the document does note that achieving a high gross national product “might itself be aided by a build-up of the economic and military strength of the United States…”,&lt;ref name="NSC 68"/&gt; and the [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert A. Lovett|Robert Lovett]] also suggested that the American economy "might benefit from the kind of build-up we are suggesting".&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Campbell., Logevall, F. (2012). ''America's Cold War: The Politics of Insecurity''. Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to U.S. foreign policy==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"For several centuries, it had proved impossible for any one nation to gain such preponderant strength that a coalition of other nations could not in time face it with greater strength."
—[http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/coldwar/documents/pdf/10-1.pdf NSC 68 p. 4]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Serving as the main point of the opening paragraph of NSC{{nbsp}}68, this sentence is a reference to the U.S. leading the international community out of World War II (by way of ending the war in Japan). The 'one nation' is in reference to the Nazis, and the 'coalition of other nations' is in reference to the Allied nations during World War II.

The document continues to identify that the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, if allowed to grow, would become such a powerful force, that no coalition of nations could band together and oppose it. This is significant because firstly, the Soviet Union is identified in the document as the antithesis of the United States, and secondly, the Soviet Union is committed to extending its sphere of influence.

A thorough knowledge of this document is required for understanding U.S. foreign policymakers in the early Cold War. After reading this document, they rapidly recognized the need for militarization out of the interest of self-preservation. In other words, the aggressive nature of Soviet expansion required a strong response from the U.S. in order to prevent the destruction of America. This, of course, was phrased in a context of military exploits (referring to the military victory in World War I and World War II), and therefore emphasized military expansion.

Also crucial in understanding this document is the language. Indeed, primary sources must be read carefully, in order to recognize themes or motifs. Adjectives provide valuable insight into the motives of this document's authors, and the impression it had on its intended audience. An example is the description of the international situation, as provoked by the Soviet Union, as endemic. By using this language, it is clear that the authors wished to portray the Soviet Union as a sickness, and the U.S. as the cure. This message was received loud and clear, and dominated many foreign policy decisions throughout the Cold War.

==Internal debate==
NSC{{nbsp}}68 drew some criticism from senior government officials who believed the Cold War was being escalated unnecessarily. When the report was sent to top officials in the Truman administration for review before its official delivery to the President, many of them scoffed at its arguments.  Willard Thorp questioned its contention that the "USSR is steadily reducing the discrepancy between its overall economic strength and that of the United States." Thorp argued: "I do not feel that this position is demonstrated, but rather the reverse... The actual gap is widening in our favor."  He pointed out that in 1949 the US economy had increased twofold over that of the Soviet Union. Steel production in the US outpaced the Soviet Union by 2 million tons; stockpiling of goods and oil production both far exceeded Soviet amounts. As for Soviet military investment, Thorp was skeptical that the USSR was committing such large portion of its GDP: "I suspect a larger portion of Soviet investment went into housing."  William Schaub of the Bureau of the Budget was particularly harsh, believing that "in every arena," the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, the stockpiling of [[atomic bombs]], the economy, the US was far superior to the Soviet Union.  Kennan, although "father" of the containment policy, also disagreed with the document, particularly its call for massive rearmament (FRUS, 1950, Vol. I).

===Truman's position===
President [[Harry S. Truman]], even after the Soviets became a nuclear power, sought to curb military spending. However, he did not reject the recommendations of NSC{{nbsp}}68 out of hand, instead of returning it to circulation and asking for an estimate of the costs involved.  In the ensuing two months, little progress was made on the report.  By June, Nitze had practically given up on it.  But on 25 June 1950, [[North Korea]]n forces crossed the [[38th parallel north]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Truman Library | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/korea/matray1.htm | title = Matray}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Korean War]] begun, NSC{{nbsp}}68 took on new importance.

===Public opinion===
The Truman Administration began a nationwide public relations campaign to convince Congress and opinion-setters of the need for strategic rearmament and containment of Soviet communism. It had to overcome isolationists, including Senator [[Robert A. Taft]], who wanted less world involvement, as well as intense anti-Communists such as [[James Burnham]] who proposed an alternative strategy of [[rollback]] that would eliminate Communism or perhaps launch a [[preemptive war]]. The State Department and the White House used the North Korean attack of June 1950 and the see-saw battles during the first few months of the Korean War to steer congressional and public opinion toward a course of rearmament between the two poles of preventive war and isolationism.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Casey, "Selling NSC-68: The Truman Administration, Public Opinion, and the Politics of Mobilization, 1950-51."

==Historical debate==
NSC{{nbsp}}68 is a source of much historical debate as is the escalation of the Cold War. It was an important part of an overall shift in American foreign policy to a comprehensive containment strategy that was confirmed by successive administrations. In 1962 scholar [[Paul Y. Hammond]] presented the first detailed, contemporary, interviews-based account of the formation of NSC{{nbsp}}68.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/JCWS_a_00306?journalCode=jcws | title=Revisiting NSC 68 | first=Ken | last=Young | journal=Journal of Cold War Studies | volume=15 | number=1 | date=Winter 2013 | pages=3–33 | &lt;!-- at=10–11 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyses range from Michael Hogan's belief that NSC{{nbsp}}68 portrayed the threat "in the worst light possible" to those believing provided an accurate picture of a genuine and growing threat.

==Conclusion==
This document is critical to understanding the Cold War with its effect on similar national security documents such as the [[A National Strategic Narrative|National Security Strategy]] March 2005, but also provides insight to current US foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kristen E. Boon|title=Assessing President Obama's National Security Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QOdMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114|year=2011|publisher=Oxford UP|page=114|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of NSC{{nbsp}}68 shows the extent to which it marked a 'shift' in US policy&amp;nbsp;— not only toward the USSR, but toward all communist governments. By signing the document, Truman provided a clearly defined and coherent US policy that did not really exist previously. Furthermore, it can be argued that NSC{{nbsp}}68, as proposed by the council, addressed Truman's problem of being attacked from the right following the "[[red scare]]" and [[Alger Hiss]] case. Although not made public, NSC{{nbsp}}68 was manifested in subsequent increases in America's conventional and nuclear capabilities, thereby adding to the country's financial burden. While NSC{{nbsp}}68 did not make any specific recommendations regarding the proposed increase in defense expenditures, the Truman Administration almost tripled defense spending as a percentage of the gross domestic product between 1950 and 1953 (from 5 to 14.2 percent).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State, Office of the Historian - [https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/NSC68 MILESTONES:1945-1952 NSC-68,1950]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Palace''' ({{lang-es|Palacio Nacional}}) is the seat of the [[Federalism|federal]] [[Executive branch|executive]] in Mexico. It is located on [[Mexico City]]'s main square, the [[Plaza de la Constitución]] (''[[Zócalo|El Zócalo]]''). This site has been a palace for the ruling class of Mexico since the [[Aztec empire]], and much of the current palace's building materials are from the original one that belonged to [[Moctezuma II]].

==Description==
The facade is bordered on the north and south by two towers and includes three main doorways, each of which lead to a different part of the building.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; The southern door leads to the Patio of Honor and presidential offices (no public access).&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt; The northern door is known as the Mariana Door, named in honor of [[Mariano Arista]] who had it constructed in 1850.  The area next to this door used to be the old Court Prison, with courtrooms and torture chambers. It is now occupied by the Finance Ministry. It contains the Treasury Room, constructed by architects Manuel Ortiz Monasterio and Vicente Mendiola. The iron and bronze door is the work of Augusto Petriccioli.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

[[File:Palacio nacional, cuidad de mexico.jpg|thumb|left|Palacio Nacional at night]]
Above the central doorway, facing the Zócalo, is the main balcony where just before 11pm on September 15, the president of Mexico gives the [[Grito de Dolores]], in a ceremony to commemorate [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexican Independence]]. Part of this ceremony includes ringing the bell that hangs above the balcony.  This bell is the original one that [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Father Miguel Hidalgo]] rang to call for rebellion against Spain.  It originally hung in the church of [[Dolores Hidalgo]], [[Guanajuato]], but was relocated here.  In the niche containing the bell, there is the Mexican [[coat of arms]]. On each side there is an [[Eagle warrior|Aztec eagle knight]] and his Spanish counterpart. These were sculpted by Manuel Centurion and symbolize the synthesis of Mexican culture and Spanish culture.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

[[File:Palacio Nacional Ciudad de México City.jpg|thumb|right|Balcony where the president of Mexico gives the annual Grito de Dolores on Independence Day and the bell from the church in Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato]]
The central door leads to the main patio which is surrounded by [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] arches. Only the [[balustrade]] of this area has been remodeled, conserving the [[mural]]s by [[Diego Rivera]] that adorn the main stairwell and the walls of the second floor. In the stairwell is a [[The History of Mexico (mural)|mural depicting the history of Mexico]] from 1521 to 1930,&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; and covers an area of 450 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (4800&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="planetware"/&gt; These murals were painted between 1929 and 1935, jointly titled "The Epic of the Mexican People".&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;  The work is divided like a [[triptych]] with each being somewhat autonomous.  The right-hand wall contains murals depicting pre-Hispanic Mexico and centers around the life of the Aztec god [[Quetzalcoatl|Quetzalcóatl]]. Quetzalcóatl appears in the mural as a star, a god, and a human being. Created by serpents, he sails through space as a star that accompanies the sun at night. Quetzalcóatl then assumes a human body to teach the Aztec people as their king and patriarch. Last, when he sacrifices his blood to give life to men, he returns to the sky having completed his earthly cycle. Once he leaves the earth, Quetzalcóatl assumes the shape the [[The planet Venus|morning star]], called [[Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli]]. The cycle that he undergoes signifies the continuous cycle of life. Rivera's creation of a Mexican identity helps to continue the reform that began with the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910. Before this time, any individualism from the Indians was discouraged as well as any allusion toward Aztec origins. The mural aims to dismiss any idea of inferiority.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web

In the middle and largest panel, the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]] is depicted with its ugliness, such as rape and torture, as well as priests defending the rights of the indigenous people. The battle for independence occupies the uppermost part of this panel in the arch. The [[Mexican–American War|American]] and [[French intervention in Mexico|French invasions]] are represented below this, as well as the [[La Reforma|Reform period]] and the Revolution. The left-hand panel is dedicated to early and mid-20th century, criticizing the status quo and depicting a [[Marxist]] kind of utopia, featuring the persons of [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], [[John D. Rockefeller]], [[Harry Ford Sinclair|Harry Sinclair]], [[Will Durant|William Durant]], [[J.P. Morgan]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] and [[Andrew Mellon]] as well as [[Karl Marx]]. This part of the mural also includes [[Frida Kahlo]], Diego's wife.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; This mural reflects Diego's own personal views about Mexico's history and the indigenous people of the country in particular.&lt;ref name="planetware"/&gt;

[[File:Campana de Dolores en el nicho de Palacio Nacional.JPG|thumb|left|Dolores bell]]
[[File:Balcon central de Palacio Nacional.JPG|thumb|right|Center balcony of the National Palace]]
Diego also painted 11&amp;nbsp;panels on the middle floor, such as the "Tianguis of Tlatelolco" (tianguis means "market"), and the "Arrival of Hernán Cortés in Veracruz".  These are part of a series depicting the pre-Hispanic era.  Peoples such as the [[Purépecha people|Tarascos]] of [[Michoacán]], the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] and [[Mixtecs]] of [[Oaxaca]] and the [[Huastecs]] of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[San Luis Potosí]] and [[Veracruz]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;   However, this series was not finished.&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt;

On the upper floor is what once was the Theatre Room of the [[viceroy]]s, which became the [[Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|Chamber of Deputies]] from 1829 to August 22, 1872, when the room was accidentally destroyed by fire.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;   In this parliamentary chamber the [[La Reforma|Reform]] [[Constitution of 1857]] was written. This and the [[Constitution of 1917]] are on display.&lt;ref name="planetware"/&gt;

The Palace has fourteen courtyards but only a few of these, such as the Grand Courtyard beyond the central portal, are open to the public. The National Palace also houses the main State Archives, with many historical documents, and the Biblioteca [[Miguel Lerdo de Tejada]], one of the largest and most important libraries in the country.&lt;ref name="planetware"/&gt;

On north annex of the building is the Treasury Room and the Benito Juárez Museum. Between the two is the Empress Stairway, built by brothers Juan and Ramón Agea. When faced with claims that their work was unstable and would collapse, they had a full battalion charge down them while they stood underneath. The Treasury Room is no longer in use.  Leading to the Museum part of the complex, which used to be the Finance Ministry, is a statue of [[Benito Juárez]] by [[Miguel Noreña]]. This work was criticized at the time because it was felt that such an honored person should not be depicted sitting on his coattails, as it was contrary to social etiquette at the time. In the Finance Ministry patio is the Benito Juárez Room, where this president lived during the end of his term and where he died on July 18, 1872. The bedroom, living room and study have been preserved complete with a number of objects belonging to the president.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

==History of the building==

===Moctezuma's "New Houses"===
The site and much of the building material of the current building is of what were called Moctezuma II's "[[Casas Nuevas de Moctezuma|New Houses]]". This palace functioned as the Aztec tlatoani's residence and performed a number of official functions as well. The building was divided into two sections and decorated with marble and painted [[stucco]]. The main façade contained the shield of the monarchy, an [[eagle]] with a [[snake]] in its claws. It has three patios surrounded by [[portico]]s, indoor sanitary facilities, fountains and gardens.  The bedrooms had tapestries of cotton, feathers and rabbit fur painted in bright colors. The floors were of polished stucco and covered in animal furs and finely-woven mats. There were rooms for servants, administrative staff, and military guards, along with kitchens, pantries and storage rooms. The richness of the palace surprised Cortés, which he relayed in letters to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]].&lt;ref name="EncMex"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia 
|editor=Jose Rogelio Alvarez 
|encyclopedia=Enciclopedia de Mexico 
|title=Palacio Nacional 
|year=1993 
|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica 
|volume=10 |location=Mexico City 
|isbn=968-457-180-1 
|pages=6141–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The palace also held a chamber reserved for the "tlacxitlan" where a group of elders, presided over by the emperor himself, would settle disputes among the citizenry. After the Conquest, these New Houses were not completely leveled to the ground but were sufficiently destroyed as to make them uninhabitable.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

===Cortés' palace===
[[File:NationalPalace aSecondYartPerspective-Mexico City-Mexico.jpg|thumb|right|Palacio Nacional garden]]

The land and the buildings on it were claimed by [[Hernán Cortés]], who had architects Rodrigo de Pontocillos and Juan Rodríguez rebuild the palace while Cortés lived in the "Old Houses" (now the [[Nacional Monte de Piedad]] building) across the plaza from 1521 to 1530.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt;

Cortés's palace was a massive fortress with [[embrasure]]s for cannon at the corners and the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] had [[crenel]]s for [[musketeer]]s. The façade had only two doors with arches (medio punto). Inside there were two patios, with a third being built after 1554 and a fourth sometime after that. Its garden was extensive, occupying much of the south and southwest portions of the property up to what is now Correo Mayor Street. The palace has living quarters, offices, two audience rooms, and a tower for gunpowder. A secondary building behind the main one has nineteen windows spanning its façade. It also had a [[parapet]], above which was a clock and a bell.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt; The main courtyard was built large enough so he could entertain visitors with [[New Spain]]'s first recorded bullfights.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt;

The Spanish crown bought the palace from the Cortés family in 1562 to house the Viceregal Palace. It remained so until Mexican Independence in the 1820s.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lonely"/&gt;

===Viceroy palace===
[[File:Royal Chapel, Mexico City.jpg|right|thumb|The Royal Chapel]]
In 1562, the Spanish Crown bought the palace and land from [[Martín Cortés (son of doña Marina)|Martin Cortés]], son of Hernan Cortés, retaining much of the Cortés palace features.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;
Due to tensions between the viceroy and the archbishop, the palace was set on fire by supporters of the archbishop in 1624. On 8 June 1692, the palace was almost completely destroyed. [[Viceroy]] Gaspar de Sandoval then had Friar Diego Valverde reconstruct the palace.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;  Historian Manuel Rivera Cambas states that after reconstruction, the palace lost its fortress-like appearance,&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; and took on a [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] appearance. Its crenels were converted into windows with ironwork [[grille]]s. framed in stonework. Inscriptions were etched above these windows and coats-of-arms were places to the sides. A smaller, third door was added on the north side of the building. On the inner, secondary building, tall windows with small ironwork balconies were installed. The south door led to what was named the "Patio of Honor"; in this section were the viceroy's quarters. The mezzanine held the offices of the Secretary and the Archives of the Viceroyalty. The lower part has servants' and [[halberdier]]s' quarters as well as storage bins for [[mercury (element)|mercury]].  This Patio of Honor opened in back toward a garden for the use of the viceroy and his court. This later became the Royal Botanical Garden in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

The main patio in the central part of the building had arches around it supported by tall, thick Baroque columns. Through this patio was access to the Audience Hall, the tax collection room, the consulate, the office of mining regulation, the General Treasury, the Royal Chapel and the Throne Room.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

The north door led to a small patio in which was located the jail and the guards' quarters. The palace essentially remained unchanged until after independence in the 1830s.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

===After independence===

Many of Mexico's leaders after independence made changes to the Viceroy Palace, including renaming it the "National Palace". Mexico's first ministries were installed such as the Ministry of Hacienda (internal revenue), Ministry of War, Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Internal and External Relations, as well as the Supreme Court. During an uprising led by [[Valentín Gómez Farías]] against then-president [[Anastasio Bustamante]], the southwest balustrade was seriously damaged during a siege lasting twelve days. In 1845, the old Chambers of Deputies was constructed, with the Senate on the upper floor of the south wing. In 1850, Mariano Arista had the old north prison door cemented shut and constructed the current northern door. He also converted the north wing into barracks of the "Batallón de Guardia de Supremos Poderes" (Battalion of Guards for the Supreme Powers). In 1864, [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Habsburg]] had three flagpoles installed in front of the three main doors. By the central door was the Mexican flag; at the north door was the [[flag of Austria]] and at the south door was the [[flag of France]]. He also had Lorenzo de la Hidalga construct the grand marble staircase that is in the Patio of Honor in the southern wing, as well as having the public rooms roofed and furnished with paintings, [[candelabra]]s, and [[chamber pot]]s from [[Hollenbach]], Austria and Sirres, France. In opposition, Benito Juárez chose to have his quarters in the north end of the Palace, rather than in the traditional southern end.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

In 1877, the Secretaría de Hacienda y Credito Público (Secretary of Internal Revenue and Public Credit), [[José Ives Limantour]], as part of his overhaul of the department, moved their offices to the north wing, finishing in 1902. He chose the largest room in the wing for the Office of Seals. In 1896, the bell that Father Hidalgo rung at the parish of Dolores, Guanajuato was moved here.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

[[File:History of Mexico mural by Diego Rivera (Mexico City).jpg|thumb|right|Left panel of Rivera's History of Mexico mural in the main stairwell]]

A number of changes were made during the rule of [[Porfirio Díaz]]. The English-made clock on the parapet was moved to the tower of the Church of Santo Domingo. The façade was cemented over and etched to look like stone block. Cloth awnings were placed on the windows of the upper floors. On pedestals near the main door, statues of female forms were placed. Inside, the ambassador's room, the dining room, the kitchens, the lounge, the garages and the stables were all refurnished. This was done at a time when French style was popular in Mexico.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

Between 1926 and 1929, the third floor was added during the term of President Plutarco Elías Calles by Alberto J. Pani, an engineer and then finance minister and designed by Augusto Petriccioli.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="planetware"/&gt; [[Merlon]]s were placed on the towers and parapet and decorative caps were placed on all three doors. The Dolores Bell was placed in a niche flanked by atlantes above the balcony above the central door. The façade was covered with red tezontle stone and installed stone frames on the doors, windows, [[cornice]]s, and parapets. In the interior, a grand staircase of marble was installed in the central patio (where Diego Rivera would later paint [[The History of Mexico]] mural) and constructed stairs to the internal revenue department and the offices of the General Treasury in the north wing. The old Chamber of Deputies, abandoned after a fire in 1872, was reconstructed and re-inaugurated as a museum to the centennial. A statue of Benito Juárez was placed in the north wing near his old quarters.  This statue was made with bronze from the cannons of the Conservative Army during the [[Reform War]] and from French projectiles from the [[Battle of Puebla]]. This caused the Palace to lose its Baroque (and French) appearance and give it the appearance it has today.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

===Palace as presidential residence===
All the viceroys that ruled New Spain during the colonial period lived in this residence except for [[Antonio de Mendoza]] and [[Juan O’Donojú]], the first and last viceroys.&lt;ref name="GTM"&gt;{{cite book |title= Guia Turística de Mexico – Distrito Federal Centro 3 |last= Bueno de Ariztegui (ed) |first=Patricia |year=1984 |publisher=Promexa |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-34-0319-0 |pages=50–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After independence, the palace was home to the two emperors who ruled Mexico during brief periods: [[Agustin de Iturbide]] and [[Maximilian I of Mexico]].  The first president to live in the building was also Mexico's first president, [[Guadalupe Victoria]], and its last occupant in the 19th century was [[Manuel González Flores|Manuel González]], president from 1880 to 1884. After that, the presidential residence was [[Los Pinos]], but the National Palace became the official residence once again with [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]], president since 2018. Famous people who stayed here include [[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]], [[Mateo Alemán]], [[Servando Teresa de Mier|Friar Servando de Mier]] (he also died here), [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Simón Bolívar]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

===2014 damages===
On November 8, 2014, alleged Anarchists deliberatedly damaged the palace facade and windows with graffiti and by breaking windows, and burned down a section of the Mariana Door after a failed attempt at breaking it down. The National Institute of History and Anthropology (INAH) handled the restoration and presented charges for the damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticieros.televisa.com/mexico-df/1411/evalua-inah-danos-puerta-palacio-nacional/|title=Evalúa INAH daños a puerta de Palacio Nacional - Noticieros Televisa|date=9 November 2014|website=Noticieros.televisa.com|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticieros.televisa.com/mexico/1411/prenden-fuego-puerta-mariana-palacio-nacional/|title=Prenden fuego a la puerta Mariana de Palacio Nacional - Noticieros Televisa|date=9 November 2014|website=Noticieros.televisa.com|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2014/11/09/arde-puerta-principal-de-palacio-nacional-tras-la-marcha-al-zocalo-por-normalistas-8791.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111203215/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2014/11/09/arde-puerta-principal-de-palacio-nacional-tras-la-marcha-al-zocalo-por-normalistas-8791.html |archive-date=2014-11-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cultura/2014/puerta-palacio-nacional-ayotzinapa-desaparecidos-marcha-maria-teresa-franco-guerrero-normalistaspuerta-palacio-nacional-ayotzinapa-desaparecidos-marcha-maria-teresa-franco-guerrero-normalistas-1052888.html|title=INAH presentará denuncia por puerta de Palacio Nacional|website=Eluniversal.com.mx|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological work==
Because of work related to the construction of [[Mexico City Metro Line 2|Metro Line 2]] and the acceleration of the sinking of many of the buildings in the historic center, the basic structure of the Palace suffered deterioration, requiring work to secure the building's foundation and supports, especially on the third floor, the central patio and the Patio of Honor. During this work, the old column bases of the Viceroy Palace were found, two of which were restored where they were found. They also found old [[Cedar wood|cedar]] rafters with their brackets, which were used to form the foundation of the first floor.&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt;

Recently, excavations in and next to the National Palace have unearthed parts of [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]]'s "New Houses", the name of the palaces that Hernán Cortés razed to build what has become the current edifice. Parts of a wall and a [[basalt]] floor were found during recent renovations on the building that now houses the Museum of Culture, which adjoins the Palace on its north side. The wall and floor are believed to be part of Casa Denegrida, or the Black House, which Spanish conquerors described as a windowless room painted in black. In here, Moctezuma would meditate on what he was told by professional [[Clairvoyance|seers]] and [[shaman]]s. It was part of a construction which is thought to have consisted of five interconnected buildings containing the emperor's office, chambers for children and several wives and even a zoo. More excavations are planned.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news

==The building's significance==
[[File:Fuente del palacio Nacional in Mexcio 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Fountain at the National Palace]]

On the webpage of past president [[Ernesto Zedillo]], [[Carlos Fuentes]] calls the National Palace a "traveling and an immobile construction".&lt;ref name="zedillo"&gt;{{cite web 
|url= http://zedillo.presidencia.gob.mx/welcome/pages/culture/note_pal.html 
|title= The National Palace: A Traveling, Unmovable structure 
|accessdate=2008-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling is used in the sense that much of its architectural style is Spanish in origin and symbolized the transplanting of Spanish civilization to the New World.  It is immobile in the sense that since Aztec times, this has been the seat of earthly political power, first as the palaces of the Aztec [[tlatoani]], then of the Spanish viceroys, then of Mexican heads of state. Only until very recently, those who held power over Mexico lived here as well as asserted their authority.&lt;ref name="zedillo"/&gt;

The building itself represents the Mexican people as a blending of both Spanish and Aztec.  The old palace was destroyed to make way for the new, but both were built of the very same stone.  According to Zedillo, this represents something that is not quite Aztec, but not quite Spanish either, much like the country itself. These same stones were present during all of Mexico's major historical events and had seen foreign flags fly above them.&lt;ref name="zedillo"/&gt;

On the eve of [[Mexican Independence Day]], the National Palace is the star of the show. The original bell Father Hidalgo rang is here and the President himself gives the [[Grito de Dolores]] from its main balcony. He also notes one such Independence Eve, in 1964, when General [[Charles de Gaulle]], then-[[President of France]], spoke to the crowd in Spanish from the Palace. He notes this to assert that the Palace is not only a place but also a destination where friends of the country can be welcomed.&lt;ref name="zedillo"/&gt;

[[File:New South Wales Post Office Directory, title page, 1886-87.jpg|thumb|New South Wales Post Office Directory, title page, 1886-87]]

The '''''New South Wales Post Office Directory''''', also known as Wise's Directories or Wise's Street Directories, was published in [[Sydney]], Australia. The directory was published from 1886-1950&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/learn/search-our-collections/house-and-building-histories/post-office-directories|title=Post office directories - City of Sydney|website=www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
The New South Wales Post Office Directory was first published in 1886/87 and ceased in 1950&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The directory was published every two years until 1900, when it became an annual publication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2626642|title=The New South Wales Post Office directory|date=1887|publisher=Wise's Directories|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The directory was originally published by Wise, Caffin &amp; Co.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation| title=The New South Wales Post Office directory | publication-date=1887 | publisher=Wise's Directories | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-596551987 | accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directories provided information by locality, individual surname, government service and by trade or profession. Early publications included a street directory for Sydney and suburbs and this later expanded to include Newcastle and West Maitland. Advertisements for local business were also present throughout the directories.  

The name of the directory changed over time: 

* 1886/87-1893/94: New South Wales Post Office Directory
* 1894/95-1898/99: New South Wales Post Office commercial directory
* 1900-03: New South Wales Post Office Commercial Directory (Wise's)
* 1904-08: New South Wales Post Office Directory (Wise's)
* 1909-15: Wise's New South Wales Post Office Directory
* 1916-30: Wise's New South Wales Post Office Directory including Federal Capital Territory

* 1939: Wise's New South Wales Post Office Commercial Directory including Australian Capital Territory
* 1940-50 :Wise's New South Wales Post Office Commercial Directory

The directories are a source of information for family history or research on New South Wales from 1886-1950 and are known colloquially as 'Wise Directories' or 'Wise Street Directories'.

The first directory was priced at 47 shillings and 6 pence&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

The '''Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence''' occurred on February 28, 1914, as a reaction to the incorporation of [[Northern Epirus]] into the newly established [[Principality of Albania]].&lt;ref name=Douglas&gt;{{cite journal | last= Douglas |first=Dakin |authorlink=Douglas Dakin |title=The Diplomacy of the Great Powers and the Balkan States, 1908–1914| format=| url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=9644TZipJpGB5AbnsYCXCg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=oKQSAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22northern+epirus%22%2Bdeclared%2Bindependence&amp;q=%22On+28+February+1914+however+Northern+Epirus+declared+its+independence+and+Venizelos+ordered+a+blockade+of+Santi-Quaranta%22 | year = 1962 | month = |journal = Balkan Studies | volume = 3 | issue =  | doi = | accessdate = 2010-11-09 |pages= 372&amp;ndash;374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pentzopoulos/&gt; The region of Northern Epirus, which corresponds to modern-day southern Albania, came under the control of the [[Greek Army|Greek forces]] during the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–13. However, the subsequent [[Treaty of London (1913)#Terms|Protocol of Florence]] assigned it to the newly established Albanian state, a decision that was rejected by the local Greek population. As the Greek army withdrew to the new border, a Panepirotic Assembly was organized by the representatives of Northern Epirus in [[Gjirokastër]] (Greek: Argyrokastro). Given the fact that [[Enosis|union]] of Northern Epirus with Greece had already been dismissed by the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)|European Great Powers]], they decided that only autonomy or alternatively an international occupation would be appropriate for the region. Finally, [[Georgios Christakis-Zografos]], the head of the assembly, declared the independence of the [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]].&lt;ref name="autonomos"/&gt;

In a proclamation to the people of Northern Epirus, Zografos maintained that their aspirations were ignored, since the Great Powers had rejected self-government within the Albanian state. Following negotiations between Albanian and Northern Epirote representatives in early May, and with the intervention of the Great Powers, the [[Protocol of Corfu]] was signed. According to this agreement, Northern Epirus would be an autonomous, fully self-governing part of Albania under the [[suzerainty]] of the Albanian prince. However, the Protocol, which recognized the Greek character of the region, was never implemented due to political instability in Albania that time.

==Background==
During the [[First Balkan War]] (1912-1913), the Greek Army breached the Ottoman defences in the [[First Balkan War#Epirus front|Epirus front]] and advanced further north. Thus, after the end of the war Greece controlled the historical region of Epirus.&lt;ref&gt;Boeckh 1996: p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] (May 1913) and the Protocol of Florence (December 1913) awarded the northern part to the newly established [[Principality of Albania]]. This area which rouphly coincided to the former Ottoman provinces ([[sanjak]]s) of Ergiri and Görice, became then known by the Greeks as Northern Epirus ({{lang-el|Βόρειος Ήπειρος}} ''Voreios Ipiros'''). This decision by the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)|European Great Powers]] was unpopular among the local Greek population.&lt;ref name=Pentzopoulos&gt;{{cite book | last= Pentzopoulos|first= Dimitri | title= The Balkan exchange of minorities and its impact on Greece | publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers | year=2002| editor= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PDc-WW6YhqEC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=%22northern+epirus%22%2Bflorence&amp;hl=el&amp;ei=EJcnTZu-L8eF5Abl7uzXCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22northern%20epirus%22%2Bflorence&amp;f=false | isbn= 978-1-85065-702-6 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the terms of the Protocol of Florence, the Greek government was obliged to evacuate its forces from the area to the new Greco-Albanian border line. The Greek government however raised concerns about the evacuation process of the Greek forces, pointing out to the Great Powers that the newly established Albanian state was unable to secure the region immediately.&lt;ref name=Stickney45&gt;Stickney, 1926: p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the Greek government and the local population feared the possibility of reprisals and atrocities at the hands of Albanian [[irregular army|irregular]] groups.&lt;ref name=Kondis124/&gt; In order to arrange the details of the evacuation with the [[International Commission of Control]], an organization set up by the Great Powers to secure peace and stability in the region, the Greek prefect of [[Corfu]] moved to [[Vlorë]], where the [[Provisional Government of Albania|provisional government of Albania]] was based.&lt;ref name=Kondis123&gt;Kondis, 1976: p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Greek authorities reassured the local Greek population that the Greek government would undertake initiatives to secure for them recognition of minority status and rights in Albanian legislation.&lt;ref name=Kondis123/&gt; The Greek authorities also warned the population of the town of [[Korçë]] (Greek: Korytsa) that any action against incorporation into Albania would be fruitless. They also insisted that the Greek army would only hand over control of the region to [[Regular army|regular]] Albanian units led by Dutch officers from the International Commission, whereas the Greek forces would fire upon any irregular Albanian bands who attempted to enter the region.&lt;ref name=Kondis123/&gt;

==Panepirotic Assembly==
Before the evacuation of the Greek Army began, an assembly of representatives of Northern Epirus, the "Panepirotic Assembly of Argyrokastro" ({{lang-el|Πανηπειρωτική Συνδιάσκεψη Αργυροκάστρου}}), took place on 13 February 1914 at [[Gjirokaster]] (Greek: Argyrokastro).&lt;ref name=Kondis123/&gt; Given the fact that [[Enosis|unification]] of Northern Epirus with Greece had already been dismissed by the Great Powers, the assembly decided that they would only accept local autonomy, or failing that, an international occupation.&lt;ref name=Kondis123/&gt; They also declared that the population of Northern Epirus felt betrayed by the official Greek government, which not only refused to provide arms, but also agreed to withdraw gradually in order to allow the Albanian forces to proceed with the occupation of Northern Epirus.&lt;ref name=Kondis124&gt;Kondis, 1976: p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kondis123/&gt;

The Assembly triggered a series of events. [[Georgios Christakis-Zografos]], a former Greek foreign minister and native of the region, arrived at Gjirokaster and discussed the situation with the local representatives. In order to ensure the protection of the local population, Zografos proposed three options to the European Powers for Northern Epirus: full autonomy under the nominal sovereignty of the Prince of Albania, extensive administrative or [[Swiss cantons|cantonal]]-type autonomy with a [[gendarmerie]] recruited exclusively among locals, or a period of direct control by the Great Powers for such time until foreign troops could be withdrawn without endangering the local populace.&lt;ref name=Stickney43&gt;Stickney, 1926: p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Epirote representatives also demanded formal recognition of the particular educational and religious rights of the local Greek Orthodox population.&lt;ref name=Stickney47&gt;Stickney, 1926: p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, for the coastal region of [[Himara]], the Assembly claimed the same privileges and autonomous status it had enjoyed during the Ottoman era.&lt;ref name=Stickney47/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kondis, 1976: p. 93: "Chimara was the center of an autonomous district consisting of seven villages and its inhabitants had often revolted against the Turks"&lt;/ref&gt; On February 22, Zografos sent a note to the representatives of the Great Powers where he addressed the present situation:&lt;ref&gt;Pyrrhus J. Ruches.

{{quote|The Panepirotic Assembly gathered in Argyrokastro has charged us to request that you agree  to call the attention of your Governments to the condition created for the Greek Orthodox Christians who have been put in Albania's possession by the declaration of the Powers.&lt;br /&gt;The populace of Epirus truly believed it had the right to hope that Europe, tearing it away from Greece and stripping it of the freedom it had enjoyed for more than a year, would at least think to safeguard its existence and its ethnic heritage it was able to preserve intact through five centuries of harsh tyranny.&lt;br /&gt;
Such being the new State's composition in being made up of so many heterogeneous elements and without ethnic and religious cohesion, a special organization was required by it to be capable of dispelling misgivings, of safeguarding property, of mediating the aspirations of the now divided and mutually hostile elements and of allowing them to develop in peace and safety.&lt;br /&gt;
Nevertheless, we believe it is impossible for Europe to be ignorant of the fate that awaits the Greek populace it wishes to hand over to Albania—a populace whose number, according even to Ottoman statistics, is greater than 130,000 and which comprises the majority in the areas sacrificed...&lt;br /&gt;
Under these conditions and in the absence of a solution that would suffice to safeguard Epirus, a solution it would have been otherwise easy to discover, the Epirote populace is forced to declare to the Powers that it cannot submit to their decision. It will declare its independence and will struggle for its existence, its traditions and its rights.}}

The following week a number of cities declared their autonomy: Himara, Gjirokaster, [[Sarandë]] (Agioi Saranta) and [[Delvinë]] (Delvino).&lt;ref&gt;Stickney, 1926: [https://books.google.com/books?id=n4ymAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42 p. 42]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declaration==
[[File:AutonomyDeclaration1914.jpg|thumb|Picture of the official ceremony of the declaration in Gjirokastër, March 1, 1914.]]

Consequently, on 28 February 1914, the Autonomous&lt;ref name="autonomos"&gt;in Greek the term [[:wiktionary:αὐτονομία|autonomos]] has a dual meaning, it can mean either independent or autonomous.&lt;/ref&gt; Republic of Northern Epirus was declared and a [[provisional government]] was formed to support the state's objectives.&lt;ref name=Kondis124/&gt; Christakis-Zografos himself became president of the provisional government.&lt;ref name=Kondis125&gt;Kondis, 1976: p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; In a proclamation to the people of Northern Epirus, Zografos maintained that their aspirations had been ignored, that the Great Powers had even denied them self-government within the Albanian state, as well as guarantees for the protection of life, property, religious freedom and of their national existence.&lt;ref name=Kondis124/&gt; The proclamation also called upon the Epirotes to make every sacrifice defending the integrity of Northern Epirus and its liberties from any attack whatsoever.&lt;ref name=Kondis123/&gt;

{{quote|Epirotes:&lt;br /&gt;Gathered in Argyrokastro, the Constituent Assembly of the delegates summoned by the will of the people has declared the formation of the Autonomous State of Northern Epirus, comprising the provinces the Greek Army is forced to abandon...}}

The declaration was also signed by the heads of the local Greek Orthodox metropolitan bishoprics: [[Vasileios of Dryinoupolis|Vasileios]] of Dryinoupolis, [[Spyridon of Athens|Spyridon]] of Vela and [[Konitsa]] and [[Germanos of Korytsa|Germanos]] of Korytsa.&lt;ref name=Kondis125/&gt; On the day of the declaration, Zografos notified the International Control Commission of his appointment as president of the provisional government and announced that the Epirotes would regard any attempt by the newly founded [[International Gendarmerie|Albanian Gendarmerie]] to cross their border as an act of hostility and would resist it.&lt;ref name=Kondis125/&gt; The Autonomous Northern Epirus also included Himara, Delvino, Sarandë, and Përmet (Premeti).&lt;ref name=Kondis125/&gt;

On the same day, Zografos sent a telegram to Korçë urging the people to follow the example of the rest of the Northern Epirotes.&lt;ref&gt;Sakellariou 1997: [https://books.google.com/books?ei=LJg4TfSjLI2v4Qa42tHSCg&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=el&amp;id=UV1oAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=korytsa%2Bzographos%2Bexample%2Bepirotes&amp;q=%22On+the+following+day%2C+Zographos+sent+a+telegram+to+Korytsa+urging+the+people+to+follow+the+example+of+the+other+Northern%22 p. 380]&lt;/ref&gt; However, on March 1, under the terms of the Protocol of Florence the town surrendered to the Albanian Gendarmerie. The Greek Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], immediately ordered the withdrawal and handover of the nearby region of [[Kolonjë]] to the Albanian units, before the population could join the uprising too. As a result, bishop Spyridon, who planned to become the head of the autonomy movement in this region, was arrested and expelled by the Greek authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Kondis, 1976: [https://books.google.com/books?ei=B4Q5Tdu3NaOL4gaZitmVCg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=tEloAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Kontoulis+to+turn+over+the+area+to+the+Albanians%22&amp;q=%22Indeed+Papoulas+instructed+Kontoulis+to+turn+over+the+area+to+the+Albanians.+Kontoulis+even+intercepted+at+Kolonja+the+Metropolitan+Spyridon+of+Vellas+and+Konitsa+and+expelled+him+from+the+town.+The+autonomous+government+had+sent+the+Metropolitan+there+to+proclaim+the+autonomy%22 p. 127]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speech on 2 March, Zografos concluded that the Northern Epirotes, after five centuries of Ottoman occupation, would not accept the destiny which the Powers had imposed upon them.&lt;ref name=Boeckh114&gt;Boeckh 1996: 114&lt;/ref&gt; The following days [[Alexandros Karapanos]] became Minister of Foreign Affairs and [[Dimitrios Doulis]] Minister of War of the provisional government.&lt;ref name=Kondis125/&gt; Doulis, a native of Northern Epirus, had earlier resigned from his post as a Colonel of the Greek Army and joined the revolutionary forces of Northern Epirus.&lt;ref&gt;Stickney, 1926: p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Epirote army reached the number of 5,000 men from the first days of its formation. The army's core consisted mainly of former members of the Greek Army, some of whom were of local Epirote ancestry. With the support of irregular volunteer units it reached a total manpower of approximately 10,000.&lt;ref name=Stickney47/&gt;

==Reactions==

===In Greece===
[[File:Carte de LEpire Du Nord.png|thumbnail|250px|Map of Northern Epirus presented to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919, by the exiled provisional government of Northern Epirus]]
The Greek Army continued with the evacuation of the region, but the process slowed down out of fear that a hasty withdrawal might offer the opportunity to irregular bands to carry out atrocities against the civilian population.&lt;ref name=Stickney45/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kondis, 1976: p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; As the official position of the Greek government towards the uprising was that of strict neutrality,&lt;ref name=Stickney43/&gt; Prime Minister Venizelos ordered the blockade of the port of [[Sarandë]] and prohibited a demonstration in Athens in favor of the uprising.&lt;ref name=Douglas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stickney43/&gt; However, it cannot be doubted that the Greek government sympathized with the demands of the Northern Epirotes. In fact, the only way for Venizelos to stop the uprising would have been to declare martial law in the region, but this action would have caused major political instability and the possible resignation of his government.&lt;ref&gt;Kondis, 1976: [https://books.google.com/books?ei=VL5STbz_IIWVswbVvI0D&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=el&amp;id=tEloAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22before+he+went+to+Argyrocastro%22&amp;q=%22The+Greeks+could+have+arrested+Zographos%2C+before+he+went+to+Argyrocastro%2C+but+if+he+were+removed%2C+his+place+could+have+been+taken+by+someone+less+amenable+to+reason.+At+this+time+Venizelos+was+in+great+difficulties.+%22#search_anchor p. 126]&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition parties in Greece even accused Venizelos of going beyond what was required of him to comply with the decision of the Great Powers, and instead of simply evacuating the districts, he was handing them over to the Albanians and depriving the Epirotes of any means of resistance.&lt;ref name="Kondis, 1976: p. 128"&gt;Kondis, 1976: p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomatic and military developments===
On the other hand, the Albanian government, unable to deal with the Northern Epirus movement, requested that the Great Powers take measures. The Albanian government claimed that although the Greek Army was evacuating the region, it was being replaced by guerrilla fighters organized by the Greek authorities.&lt;ref name=Stickney47/&gt; Meanwhile, on March 7, 1914, Prince [[William of Wied]] arrived in Albania and immediately ordered the Dutch colonel [[Lodewijk Thomson]] to negotiate with the Northern Epirote representatives. Thompson met with Karapanos on March 10, and proposed a limited local administration for Northern Epirus under a Christian governor in addition to guarantees of religious and educational rights. Thompson's initiative was dismissed by the Northern Epirote side.&lt;ref name="Kondis, 1976: p. 128"/&gt;

On April 11, Epirote revolutionaries took control of Korçë, but four days later the Albanian Gendarmerie, led by Dutch officers, recaptured the city. As a result, the Dutch arrested and expelled the Greek Orthodox bishop Germanos, since they had proof that he was the chief instigator of the uprising, as well as other members of the town council.&lt;ref&gt;Kondis Basil, 1976, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=el&amp;id=tEloAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=dutch%2Bgermanos#search_anchor ''Greece and Albania, 1908-1914'' p. 129-130]: "Albanian gendarmerie under the command of Dutch Major Shneller managed to crush the revolt and to restore order. The Dutch, having proof that Metropolitan Germanos was chief instigator of the rising, arrested him and other members of the town council and sent them to Elbasan."&lt;/ref&gt; After the complete withdrawal of the Greek Army from the region on April 28, conflicts between the Northern Epirote forces and Albanian gendarmes broke out in several locations.&lt;ref&gt;Boeckh, 1996, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stickney, 1926: p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Intense fighting occurred in the region of [[Cepo]], north of Gjirokastër, where Albanian gendarmerie units tried unsuccessfully to infiltrate southwardly, facing resistance from the Northern Epirote forces.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1966, p. 519&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Epirotes managed to advance and gain control of [[Erseka]] and further advanced on [[Frashër]] and Korçë.&lt;ref&gt;Kondis, 1976: p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

By early May, the Albanian authorities, being unable to suppress the movement in Northern Epirus, became willing to start discussions with the intervention of the International Commission. Thus, Prince [[William of Wied]] of Albania asked the Commission, which represented the Albanian government, to initiate negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Stickney, 1926: p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, in order to avoid a major escalation of the armed conflicts with disastrous results, decided to intervene. On May 7, Zografos received a communication to initiate negotiations on a new basis and accepted the proposal. Thus, an armistice was ordered the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Kondis, 1976: p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{Further|Protocol of Corfu}} [[File:Protocol of Corfu 1914.JPG|thumb|Picture of the negotiations that led to the Protocol of Corfu.]]
The representatives of both sides met for negotiations in Sarandë, but the final negotiations took place in the nearby island of [[Corfu]], [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Stickney, 1926, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on May 17, 1914, the representatives of Northern Epirus and Albania signed an agreement that granted the chief demands of the Epirotes and became known as the [[Protocol of Corfu]].&lt;ref name="Stickney, 1926, p. 50"&gt;Stickney, 1926, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; According to this agreement, Northern Epirus, which consisted of the regions surrounding the cities of Gjirokastër and Korçë would be an autonomous, fully self-governing part of Albania under the [[suzerainty]] of the Albanian prince.&lt;ref&gt;O' Brien, 2008: p. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

In general the Protocol recognized the Greek character of the region and the Greek language acquired an official status there, next to the Albanian one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=editor|first1=Jonathan Stein,|title=The Politics of National Minority Participation in Post-Communist Europe: State-Building, Democracy, and Ethnic Mobilization|date=2000|publisher=Sharpe|location=Armonk, N.Y.|isbn=9780765605283|page=171|quote=In May 1914, the Great Powers signed the Protocol of Corfu, which recognized the area as Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Castellan|first1=Georges|title=History of the Balkans : from Mohammed the Conqueror to Stalin|date=1992|publisher=East European Monographs [u.a.]|location=Boulder|isbn=9780880332224|page=385|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=el&amp;id=1G5pAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=|quote=... the Protocol of Corfu (May 1914) gave a measure of autonomy to the region where the Greek language became the official language together with Albanian.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main demands of the Northern Epirote government were accepted. However, a number of issues were not granted, in particurlar the extension of the area in which the Greek population would enjoy education in its native language in the regions around Vlorë and [[Durrës]] (in central Albania, to the north of Northern Epirus), the appointment of [[Greek Orthodoxy|Greek Orthodox]] higher officials in the main towns of the autonomous area and the exemption from military service of the local population, even in time of war.&lt;ref name="Stickney, 1926, p. 50"/&gt;

However, the Protocol was never implemented due to political instability in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;Sakellariou, 1997: [https://books.google.com/books?ei=1AE6TevkFsLd4AbY17nGCg&amp;ct=result&amp;sqi=2&amp;hl=el&amp;id=UV1oAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22northern+epirus%22%2B1921%2Balbania&amp;q=%22On+9+November+1921+%2C+a+special+Conference+of+Ambassadors+in+Paris+thus+determined+the+Greek-Albanian+borders+in+accordance+with+the+line+set+by+the+Florence+Protocol+of+17+December+1913%2C+under+which+Northern+Epirus+was+unconditionally+ceded+to+Albania%22#search_anchor p. 387]&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 October, after approval from the Great Powers, the Greek army re-entered Northern Epirus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guy |first1=Nicola |year=2007 |title=The Albanian Question in British Policy and the Italian Intervention, August 1914-April 1915 |journal=Diplomacy and Statecraft |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=109–131 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |doi=10.1080/09592290601163035 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a771302998~frm=titlelink}} "Greek troops crossed the southern Albanian border at the end of October 1914, officially reoccupying all of southern Albania, exclusive of Vlora, and establishing a military administration by 27 October 1914."&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional Government of Northern Epirus formally ceased to exist, declaring that it accomplished its mission.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1966, p. 522&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Online Egyptological Bibliography (OEB) ''' is an online database of (printed) publications in the field of Egyptology, published by the Griffith Institute, Oxford.
The OEB is the successor of the ''Annual Egyptological Bibliography'' (AEB), which appeared in print until 2001.

==Annual Egyptological Bibliography==
One of the initial goals of the [[International Association of Egyptologists|International Association of Egyptologists (IAE)]] at its foundation in 1947 was to produce overviews of literature relevant to Egyptology, to aid Egyptological research. [[Jozef Marie Antoon Janssen|Jozef M.A. Janssen]], a Dutch Egyptologist at [[Leiden University]], was asked to publish a yearly list of titles with abstracts. The first volume appeared in 1948. Volumes 1 (1947)-30 (1976) were published by [[Brill Publishers|Brill]], volumes 31 (1977)-35 (1981) by Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd.
After Janssen’s death in 1963, Dutch Egyptologist [[Matthieu Sybrand Huibert Gerard Heerma van Voss|M.S.G.H. Heerma van Voss]] assumed the task of AEB Editor-in-Chief, with the help of a number of assistant editors. He was succeeded by [[Jacobus Johannes Janssen|Jac. J. Janssen]] (1967-1978), L.M.J. Zonhoven (1979-1984), and W. Hovestreydt (1984-2008).
In the 1980s, yearly volumes of ''Preliminary Egyptological Bibliography'' were also published.
Due to budget cuts at Leiden University, the [[The Netherlands Institute for the Near East|Netherlands Institute for the Near East (NINO)]] took up responsibility for the AEB in 1992. Volumes 36 (1982)-53 (2001) were published by NINO. Hovestreydt together with H.S. van den Berg developed a digital administration of the bibliographical information, which led to the publication in 2001 of the cd-rom ''Egyptological bibliography 1822-1997'' (which included the digitized information of C. Beinlich's ''Bibliographie Altägypten 1822-1947''), and the ''AEB Online'' website in 2007.

==Move to Oxford==
Starting from 2009, the AEB was transferred to Oxford and renamed Online Egyptological Bibliography. No more print volumes were published. In 2011, the German bibliography ''Aigyptos'' was incorporated.

The '''''Probert Encyclopaedia''''' is a defunct online [[encyclopedia]] containing over 110,000 entries organized topically, written and published by Matthew Probert under the name Probert Publishing. It has unusual search functions which create pages containing the text of all the articles matching the search, rather than giving a list of results.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930223301/http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/xphrase.pl?keyword=physics Link of Web archive"] showing example search result page for "Physics"&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Probert Encyclopaedia'' was first published in 1993 as a knowledgebase for [[artificial intelligence]] systems and has subsequently been developed to include the topics omitted by other encyclopaedias. It was available as downloadable [[freeware]] until the 18th edition, published in December 1998, when Probert reserved the rights of distribution after finding people had reproduced his work on their privately owned websites, without permission.{{citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Papal '''regesta''' are the copies, generally entered in special registry volumes, of the [[papal]] letters and official documents that are kept in the papal archives. The name is also used to indicate subsequent publications containing such documents, in chronological order, with summaries of their essential contents, for which English diplomatics use usually the term [[Calendar (archives)|"calendar"]].

==Early history==

The growth of the correspondence of the [[Holy See]] is evident even by the end of the 2nd century. Probably from a very early date a copy was made of papal documents before their dispatch, and that the collection of these documents was preserved at the seat of the central administration of the Roman Church. At that time high officials of the Roman State administration, the imperial chancery, the Senate, the consuls, the provincial governments, had all official documents entered in such volumes and preserved in the archives. The books in which these documents were entered were called ''commentarii regesta'', the latter word from ''regerere'', to inscribe.

The existence of such papal regesta can be proved for the 4th century and the succeeding era. In his polemic with [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] ("Apolog. adv. Rufinum", III, xx), [[St. Jerome]] refers to the archives (''chartarium'') of the Roman Church, where the letter of [[Pope Anastasius I|Pope Anastasius]] (399-401) on the controversy over the doctrines of Origen was preserved. There are also notices concerning the registration of papal letters in the documents of several popes of the 5th century. Thus Pope Zosimus in his letter of 22 Sept., 417, to the bishops of Africa refers to the fact that all the earlier negotiations with Coelestius had been examined at Rome (Coustant, "Epist. Rom. Pontif.", 955). Consequently, copies of the documents in question must have existed. From this time onwards it remained the fixed custom of the papal chancery to copy the official papers issued by it in registers.

==Surviving regesta==

From the centuries previous to the pontificate of [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1199–1216) there remain only fragments of the registry volumes of the papal chancery and these in large part merely in later copies. Nearly all the volumes of the papal regesta up to the end of the 12th century have disappeared.

The most important fragments of this period that have been preserved are: nearly 850 letters, in three groups, of the Regesta of [[Pope Gregory I]] (590-604). An investigation proved that the original Regesta consisted of fourteen papyrus volumes, corresponding to the number of years of the pontificate, which were arranged according to [[indictions]]; that each of these volumes was divided into twelve parts, before each of which the name of the corresponding month was written. This indicates the plan of the earliest volumes of the papal Regesta. A manuscript of the Vatican archives contains letters of [[Pope John VIII|John VIII]] (872-882) from September 876 to the end of the pontificate. This is not an original register, but an 11th-century copy. Separate letters, fifty-five in number, belonging to the first four years of the pontificate of this pope, are in a manuscript of the 12th century in the British Museum (Ms. Add. 8874). The manuscript contains letters of [[Gelasius I]] (492-96), [[Pelagius I]] (556-561), [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]] (847-55), John VIII (872-82), [[Pope Stephen V|Stephen V]] (885-91), Alexander II (1061–73), and [[Urban II]] (1088–99). The study of the manuscript by Ewald ["Neues Archiv", V (1880), 275 sqq., 503 sqq.] led to important conclusions concerning the volumes of the Regesta. Another manuscript at Cambridge contains some seventy letters from the Regesta of Adrian IV (1154–59), Alexander III (1159–81), and Lucius III (1181–85) [see Löwenfeld in "Neues Archiv", X, 1885, 585 sqq.]. Again, large parts of the Regesta of Gregory VII (1073–85), namely 381 letters, are contained in a manuscript in the Vatican archives. This collection is also only an extract of the original Regesta. In it the letters are no longer arranged according to indictions, but according to the year of the pontificate. A fraction of the Regesta of the antipope Anacletus II (1130–38) containing thirty-eight letters has been preserved in a manuscript of Monte Cassino (Ewald in "Neues Archiv", III, 164 sqq.). Besides these collections of letters which have preserved fragments of the earliest papal Regesta, rich material is also to be found in the canonical collections of the Middle Ages. In part these collections go back directly or indirectly to the volumes of the Regesta of the papal archives, from which the authors of these collections, as Anselm of Lucca, and above all Deusdedit, gathered the greater part of their material.

==From the 13th century==

From [[Pope Innocent III]] onward the manuscript volumes of the papal Regesta still exist in the Vatican Archives.

The Regesta of the 13th century are beautifully written parchment volumes. Yet the most of these in their present form have been made from older volumes. How these older volumes, the real original Regesta, were planned cannot be decided. From the 14th century onward, registry volumes of paper were used for the entering of the copies. However, when the popes returned from Avignon to Rome, these paper Regesta were left at Avignon, and copies of them were made in parchment registry volumes that were brought to Rome. At a later era, the original Regesta volumes were also brought to the Vatican Archives so that there are two series in existence for the Avignon epoch of the 14th century. From the 14th century onwards the volumes of the Regesta were generally made of paper. Numerous investigations have been made by various scholars as to the arrangement of the volumes of the Regesta, the rules or customs observed in the entering of the separate pieces, as to the question of whether the draft or the finished letter was copied, and as to many other matters in diplomatics, without reaching very certain results. In the 13th century the letters were divided into "Litteræ communes" and "Litteræ de curia" or "Curiales", the latter dealing mostly with affairs of general importance. At a later date other headings (litteræ secretæ, litteræ de beneficiis) were also introduced. Besides the regular Regesta of the papal letters made in the papal chancery, there were similar Regesta of the papal letters executed since the 14th century in the Apostolic Camera. From about the middle of the 14th century the registers of petitions were also preserved, in which were entered, not the papal documents, but the memorials to the pope, in reply to which the papal documents were issued.

==As historical sources==

As collections of the official documents of the papal chancery, the Regesta are a very important historical authority.{{According to whom|date=January 2011}} For convenience in historical investigation various scholars have published in chronological order all known papal documents of large periods, with brief summaries of the contents of the letters. The three greatest collections of this kind are:

*[[Philipp Jaffé]], "Regesta Pontificum Romanorum ab condita ecclesia ad annum p. Chr. n. 1198"; 2nd ed. by S. Löwenfeld, F. Kaltenbrunner, P. Ewald (2 vols., Leipzig, 1888); 3rd ed. by Klaus Herbers, Waldemar Könighaus, Cornelia Scherer, Thorsten Schlauwitz, Marucs Schütz, Viktoria Trenkle, Judith Werner (vol. 1 (39?-604), Göttingen 2016).
*[[Paul Fridolin Kehr]] has undertaken a new edition of the Regesta for this period in topographical and at the same time chronological order: "Regesta Pontif. Roman.: Italia Pontifica" (Berlin, 1906–); "Germania Pontificia" (Berlin, 1910-); Gallia Pontificia; Iberia Pontificia; Polonia Pontificia; with the cooperation of other scholars.
*Jaffé's work was supplemented by [[August Potthast]], "Regesta Pontificum Romanorum inde ab an p. Chr. n. 1198 ad an. 1304 (2 vols., Berlin, 1874-75).

The database [http://www.papsturkunden.de "Regesta Pontificum Romanorum online"] from the "Göttinger Papsturkundenwerk" will combine the several Regesta projects up to the year 1198.

Letters of several popes taken from the volumes of the Regesta have been published by: Löwenfeld: "Epistolæ Pontificum Romanorum ineditæ" (Leipzig, 1885) taken from the manuscript at Cambridge; Rodenberg, "Epistolæ sæc. XIII e Regestis Rom. Pont. selectæ" (Berlin, 1883 —), in "Mon. Germ. Hist." The Regesta of the letters of Gregory I were edited again by Ewald and Hartmann, "Gregorii I Registrum epistolarum" in "Mon. Germ. Hist." (Berlin, 1891 —).

The letters of Gregory VII were edited by Jaffé, "Monumenta Gregoriana" in "Bibliotheca Rerum Germanicarum" (2 vols., Berlin, 1868). As early as 1591 the records of John VIII were published from the manuscript in the Vatican. Of the popes of the 13th century, Pressuti edited (Rome, 1888–96) the Regesta on Honorarius III (1216–27) from the volumes of the Regesta in the Vatican Archives; the Regesta of the succeeding popes to Boniface VII (d. 1303) were edited by the members of the Ecole Françoisaise of Rome, the publication of the Regesta of all the popes being yet incomplete; after a group of Benedictines had issued the Regesta of Clement V (1305–14), the members of the Ecole Françoisaise began again with John XXII (1316–34), with the intention of publishing the Regesta of the Avignon popes to Gregory XI (1370–78). In this later series, besides the documents of general interest, they kept in view particularly those documents that bore on the history of France. For the later eras only the first numbers were published of the Regesta of Leo X (1513–21), edited by [[Cardinal Hergenröther]] (see under the different popes).

In addition a number of works have been issued or are in course of publication that contain Regesta from the Vatican Regesta of the 14th century, bearing on special questions or on the history of various countries and dioceses, e.g., Werunsky, "Excerpts ex registris Clementis VI et Innocenti VI (Innsbruck, 1885); Ruezler, "Vatikanische Akten zur deutschen Geschichte in der Zeit Ludwigs des Bayern" (Munich, 1890).

In '''''S v Jackson''''',&lt;ref&gt;1963 (2) SA 626 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; an important case in South African criminal law, the Appellate Division held that a person is justified in killing in self-defence not only when he fears that his life is in danger but also when he fears grievous bodily harm. PE Linde appeared for the appellant and BG van der Walt, SC, Attorney-General OFS, for the State. The case was heard on March 8, 1963. The appellant's attorney was DA Carroll, Johannesburg.

== Facts  ==
In an appeal from a conviction of culpable homicide on a charge of murder, it appeared that the trial judge had repeatedly directed the jury that they could not acquit the appellant, on his plea of self-defence, unless they came to the conclusion that a reasonable man in his situation would have feared that his life was in danger.

== Judgment ==
The court held that the trial judge should have directed the jury that the appellant would have been justified in shooting the deceased if he justifiably feared that he was about to suffer grievous bodily harm at his hands. The failure so to direct the jury was an irregularity which had prejudiced the appellant, because it appeared that the jury might have found that, even though he did not fear for his life, he most certainly feared very serious bodily harm when he was assaulted by the deceased. The appeal was accordingly allowed and the conviction and sentence set aside.

Martel began her professional wrestling career in the Mid South after training in [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. She joined the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) in the mid-1980s and held its [[AWA World Women's Championship]] three times. In the late 1980s, she joined the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), where she held the [[WWF Women's Championship]]. Also in the WWF, Martel continued to act as a manager to wrestlers such as [[Randy Savage]], [[Ted DiBiase]], and [[Shawn Michaels]]. She appeared in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in the 1990s. In the latter, Martel acted as the manager for the [[tag team]] [[Harlem Heat]]. After leaving WCW, she made few wrestling related appearances until her death in 2007. She also appeared in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] in September 2006 as a manager for [[Bobby Roode]] which ended up being her last televised wrestling appearance.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1974-1985)===
Martel was first introduced to professional wrestling as a child, when her mother took her and her sister to shows in Mississippi.&lt;ref name=raw/&gt; In 1974, Martel approached [[Grizzly Smith]] for advice on becoming a wrestler, but he questioned her conviction and told her to come back to him in five years when she was an adult.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; She eventually married her second husband and gave birth to a son named Jared, but she soon divorced her husband.&lt;ref name=raw&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenberg|first1=Keith Elliot|year=2003|title=Still Sensational|journal=RAW Magazine|volume=October|pages=26–29|url=http://www.sensationalsherri.com/rawmag/01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; During this time, she again became interested in becoming a professional wrestler and sought training from "Mr. Personality" Butch Moore in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; She started wrestling as Sherri Martine, but decided she needed more training.&lt;ref name=raw/&gt; She continued to train at [[The Fabulous Moolah]]'s school, where Moolah changed her name to Sherri Martel and sent her to wrestle in Japan in 1981.&lt;ref name=raw/&gt; Moolah claims that Martel frequented night clubs and liked to party, which resulted in Moolah kicking her out of the school.&lt;ref name=moo196/&gt;

After leaving the school, she traveled back to Tennessee.&lt;ref name=raw/&gt; In Memphis, she was managed by [[Jim Cornette]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; During a mixed [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]], Martel suffered an injury that removed her from wrestling temporarily.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; She then worked as both a wrestler and manager for Pat Rose and [[Tom Prichard]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

===American Wrestling Association (1985&amp;ndash;1987)===
After recovering, [[Larry Zbyszko]] helped her join the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA).&lt;ref name=raw/&gt; She eventually debuted in the AWA and, on September 28, 1985, at ''[[SuperClash#SuperClash|SuperClash]]'' in [[Chicago]], she defeated [[Candi Devine]] for the [[AWA World Women's Championship]].&lt;ref name=shields136&gt;Shields, Brian. ''Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s'', 136–138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hof/&gt; She traded the belt with Devine, and on June 28, 1986, at "Battle by the Bay," Martel defeated Devine to win the AWA World Women's Championship for a third and final time.&lt;ref name=hof/&gt; Martel, however, only held the title briefly before vacating it.&lt;ref name=shields136/&gt;

During this time, in addition to wrestling, Martel acted as the [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] for the team of "Playboy" [[Buddy Rose]] and "Pretty Boy" [[Doug Somers]], whom she managed to win the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name=hof/&gt; Rose and Somers then engaged in a lengthy feud with [[The Rockers#Midnight Rockers|The Midnight Rockers]] ([[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Marty Jannetty]]),&lt;ref&gt;Michaels, Shawn. ''Heartbreak and Triumph'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; who defeated Rose and Somers for the tag team title on January 27, 1987, in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|year=2006|edition=4th|chapter=AWA World Tag Team Championship|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Wrestling Federation (1987-1993)===

====Debut &amp; Women's Champion (1987&amp;ndash;1988)====
After former AWA wrestler [[Jesse Ventura]] referred her to the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF),&lt;ref name=raw/&gt; she debuted on July 24, 1987, defeating The Fabulous Moolah for the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|WWF Women's Championship]].&lt;ref name=moo196&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p.196–197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hof/&gt; Renaming herself Sensational Sherri, she reigned as WWF Women's Champion for fifteen months before losing it to [[Rockin' Robin (wrestler)|Rockin' Robin]] on October 8, 1988 in [[Paris]], [[France]].&lt;ref name=shields136/&gt;&lt;ref name=moo196/&gt;&lt;ref name=hof/&gt;&lt;ref name=hof/&gt; At the [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] in 1987, Martel's team consisting of Martel, [[WWF Women's Tag Team Championship|Women's World Tag Team Champions]] The Glamour Girls ([[Leilani Kai]] and [[Judy Martin (wrestler)|Judy Martin]]), [[Dawn Marie Johnston|Dawn Marie]], and [[Donna Christanello]] lost to The Fabulous Moolah's team consisting of Moolah, [[Velvet McIntyre]], Rockin' Robin, and the [[Jumping Bomb Angels]] ([[Noriyo Tateno]] and [[Itsuki Yamazaki]]).&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Brian. ''Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s'', 164.&lt;/ref&gt; When the WWF phased out its women's division in 1990, Martel remained with the company and turned her attention to managing male wrestlers.&lt;ref name=hof/&gt;

Concurrent with her reign as WWF Women's Champion, Martel made several appearances in costume as "Peggy Sue," the girlfriend of [[The Honky Tonk Man]], who was in the midst of a run as Intercontinental Champion. Her primary role was to irritate Honky's opponents—namely, [[Randy Savage|Randy "Macho Man" Savage]] and [[Brutus Beefcake|Brutus "the Barber" Beefcake]]—and interfere in his matches.

====Managing Randy Savage and Ted DiBiase (1989&amp;ndash;1992)====
After [[WrestleMania V]], Martel confronted Miss Elizabeth, manager of newly-dethroned former WWF World champion Randy Savage, during an interview, leading to a confrontation between the two in which Savage fired Elizabeth and repeatedly threatened to hit her.&lt;ref&gt;Dethroned and demoralised!  Can Randy Savage Recover From Wrestlemania V? - The Wrestler August 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  Martel then attacked [[Hulk Hogan]] from behind as he came to Elizabeth's rescue, leaving him open to a chair attack from Savage,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/89.htm "... featured highlights of the WWF World Champion Randy Savage vs. Hulk Hogan match from WrestleMania V to begin the broadcast with exclusive footage also from backstage after the match, in which Gene Okerlund was preparing to interview Miss Elizabeth before Sensational Sherri and Randy Savage interrupted, with WWF World Champion Hulk Hogan eventually stepping in; moments later, Sherri distracted Hogan long enough for Savage to hit Hogan with a steel chair..." History of WWE - 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the remainder of 1989, Martel and Savage [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with Hogan and Elizabeth.&lt;ref name=hof/&gt; At [[SummerSlam (1989)|SummerSlam]], Hogan and Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake defeated the team of Savage and [[Tom Lister, Jr.|Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Brian. ''Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Elizabeth knocked out Martel with Martel's purse, and she, Hogan, and Beefcake cut Martel's hair.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

At [[WrestleMania VI]] in 1990, Martel and Savage lost a mixed tag-team match against [[Sapphire (wrestler)|Sapphire]] and [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] after Elizabeth, who was in the corner of Sapphire and Rhodes, interfered and shoved Martel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|author=Shields, Brian and Kevin Sullivan|publisher=DK/BradyGAMES|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that same year, Martel and Savage appeared on ''[[Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous]]'' with [[Robin Leach]].&lt;ref name=shields136/&gt;  During a steel cage match at [[Madison Square Garden]], [[The Ultimate Warrior]] pulled off an escaping Martel's miniskirt to reveal matching black garter belts and lace underpants. Practically in tears, Martel raced back to the locker room. At [[WrestleMania VII]], Savage lost a "retirement match" against  The Ultimate Warrior, in which the loser would be forced ([[Kayfabe]]) to retire.&lt;ref name=shields136/&gt;&lt;ref name=spec&gt;{{cite book|title=Professional wrestling: sport and spectacle|author=Mazer, Sharon|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|year=1998|isbn=1-57806-021-4|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Savage lost the match, an irate Martel attacked Savage but was thrown from the ring by Elizabeth, who had been watching from the audience.&lt;ref name=shields136/&gt;&lt;ref name=spec/&gt; Later on the WM7 card after she and Savage parted ways following the career match, Martel came to the ring to help [[Ted DiBiase|"The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase]] in his assault on an injured [[Rowdy Roddy Piper]], following which she managed DiBiase until 1992.&lt;ref name=raw/&gt;&lt;ref name=hof/&gt;

====Pairing and feuding with Shawn Michaels (1992&amp;ndash;1993)====
Subsequently, Martel began managing [[Shawn Michaels]] after [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] convinced Michaels to participate in the storyline.&lt;ref&gt;Michaels, Shawn. ''Heartbreak and Triumph'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; She also sang Michaels theme song called "Sexy Boy".&lt;ref name=hof&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/sherrimartel/|title=Sherri Martel's bio|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his gimmick, Michaels would admire himself in a full-length mirror before his matches.&lt;ref name=hbk166&gt;Michaels, Shawn. ''Heartbreak and Triumph'', p. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, before a match, his former partner [[Marty Jannetty]] grabbed the mirror and attempted to hit Michaels with it, but Michaels pulled Martel in front of him.&lt;ref name=hbk166/&gt; After being hit with the mirror, she was absent from television until the [[Royal Rumble (1993)|Royal Rumble]] in January 1993.&lt;ref name=hbk166/&gt; At the Rumble, she was in a neutral corner for the match between Michaels and Jannetty but eventually turned on Michaels during the match.&lt;ref name=hbk166/&gt; Backstage, Michaels confronted her and Jannetty came to her rescue.&lt;ref name=hbk166/&gt; The storyline, however, was cut short as Jannetty was released from the company in the midst of the feud.&lt;ref name=hbk166/&gt; Martel spent the remainder of the year aligned with [[Chris Chavis|Tatanka]], who aided her in her feud with [[Luna Vachon]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]]. She was released from the World Wrestling Federation during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/bios/s/sherri-martel/|title=Sherri Martel|work=Online World of Wrestling|access-date=2018-01-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USWA (1993)===
Towards the end of her time in the WWF, Martel participated in a WWF invasion angle in the [[United States Wrestling Association|USWA]], reuniting with Savage. Martel would suffer a similar embarrassment to that which she had suffered at the hands of Warrior when she ran in the ring to aid Savage in a steel cage match in Memphis against his old enemy in the area, [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry "The King" Lawler]], but after accidentally knocking Savage from the ring, she had her dress yanked off by Lawler as she climbed the cage to escape.

===Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1993)===
After her WWF release, Martel had a brief spell in [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]], siding with [[Tracy Smothers]] in a feud with [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Tammy Fytch]], [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|Brian Lee]], as well as several intergender matches with [[Jim Cornette]].

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993–1994)===
She began working in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) in 1993, managing [[Shane Douglas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.franchisefansite.com/bio.html|title=Biography|publisher=FranchiseFanSite.com|accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherri turned on Douglas in a tag match with [[Brian Pillman]], costing Douglas the match on behalf of [[Ric Flair]]. At [[November to Remember (1993)|November to Remember]] on November 13, Martel faced [[Malia Hosaka]] in a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=November to Remember|series=Extreme Championship Wrestling|network=pay-per-view|airdate=November 13, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Championship Wrestling (1994&amp;ndash;1997)===
====Managing with Ric Flair (1994)====
Martel signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1994. The original plan for her was to manage [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin]] and [[Dave Sullivan (wrestler)|Dave Sullivan]] against [[Missy Hyatt]] and [[The Nasty Boys]], but after Hyatt was fired in February 1994, the proposed rivalry went on with no managers for either team.

Martel made her debut on the April 23 edition of ''WCW Saturday Night'', under the name Sensuous Sherri. In an interview with [[Gene Okerlund]], she said her goal was to find a man that can bring her the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]]. She was at ringside during at [[Slamboree (1994)|Slamboree]] on May 22, during the WCW World Heavyweight Championship match between [[Ric Flair]] and [[Barry Windham]]. On June 24, a title unification match took place at the ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XXVII|Clash of the Champions XXVII]]'' between WCW World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair and the [[WCW International World Heavyweight Championship|WCW International World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]]. Although she revealed in the beginning of the match she sided with Sting (including wearing his signature face paint), it turned out to be a double cross, as she sided with Flair, who won the match and unified the titles, double-teaming Sting, until the newly signed [[Hulk Hogan]] made the save.

At [[Bash at the Beach (1994)|Bash at the Beach]], Martel tried to help Flair to defeat Hogan in a match by giving him brass knuckles but failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ric Flair: To Be the Man|author=Flair, Ric|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2005|isbn=0-7434-9181-5|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the feud's climactic battle, a steel cage match at Halloween Havoc, Martel climbed the cage to aid Flair and in the process had her dress pulled off by Jimmy Hart, Hogan's manager, leaving her dangling from the cage in black lingerie.

====Managing with Harlem Heat and departure (1994&amp;ndash;1997)====
Next, Martel began managing [[Harlem Heat]] ([[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] and [[Stevie Ray]]) using the name Sister Sherri.&lt;ref name=hof/&gt; She managed the team to seven [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] reigns.&lt;ref name=demo/&gt; In late 1994 (while still managing Harlem Heat in WCW), Martel made a return appearance in ECW managing Shane Douglas and [[Brian Pillman]] against [[Ron Simmons]] and [[2 Cold Scorpio]].&lt;ref name=ecw&gt;{{cite book|title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of the ECW|author=Williams, Scott E.|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2006|isbn=1-59670-021-1|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back in WCW, Martel had a brief on-screen romance with [[Robert Fuller|Col. Robert Parker]] until October 1996 when Harlem Heat fired him and Martel had a match with him at [[World War 3 (1996)|World War 3]] in November. She continued to manage Harlem Heat until she got fired from the group on the July 7, 1997 edition of ''Nitro''.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Brian. ''Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s'', 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career (1999-2006)===
Early in 1999, Martel competed in a mixed-tag team match for the Apocalypse Wrestling Federation's Heavyweight Championship, a title held predominately by men.&lt;ref name=awf/&gt; [[Missy Hyatt]] pinned Martel to win the title.&lt;ref name=awf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awfaction.com/?mod=titles&amp;pageid=7&amp;title=AWF+Championship&amp;note=3|title=AWF Championship: Missy Hyatt|publisher=Apocalypse Wrestling Federation|accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1999, she appeared on the ''[[Heroes of Wrestling]]'' pay-per-view managing [[Greg Valentine]] in a match against [[George Steele]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/oct11_her.html|title=Heroes PPV a disappointment |author=Oliver, Greg|publisher=SLAM!

In 2000, she made three wrestling television appearances with World Championship Wrestling (WCW).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6345">In [[computer programming]], a '''statement''' is a syntactic unit of an [[Imperative programming|imperative]] [[programming language]] that expresses some action to be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/statement.html | title = statement | publisher = webopedia | accessdate = 2015-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A program written in such a language is formed by a sequence of one or more statements. A statement may have internal components (e.g., [[Expression (computer science)|expressions]]).

Many imperative languages (e.g. [[C (programming language)|C]]) make a distinction between statements and definitions, with a statement only containing executable code and a definition instantiating an [[identifier (computer programming)|identifier]], while an expression evaluates to a value only. A distinction can also be made between simple and compound statements; the latter may contain statements as components.

==Kinds of statements==
The following are some of the major generic kinds of statements, pseudocoded. These pseudocoded statements have an immediate corresponding syntax in any typical imperative language like 
Pascal, C, Fortran etc.:

===Simple statements===
* '''[[Assertion (computing)|assertion]]'''

* '''[[with-statement|{{visible anchor|with-statement}}]]''': &lt;code&gt;with open(filename) as f: use(f)&lt;/code&gt;

==Syntax==
The appearance of statements shapes the look of programs. Programming languages are characterized by the type of statements they use (e.g. the [[curly brace language]] family). Many statements are introduced by [[identifier (computer programming)|identifiers]] like ''if'', ''while'' or ''repeat''. Often statement [[Keyword (computer programming)|keywords]] are reserved such that they cannot be used as names of [[Variable (programming)|variables]] or [[Function (computer science)|functions]]. Imperative languages typically use special syntax for each statement, which looks quite different from function calls. Common methods to describe the syntax of statements are [[Backus–Naur form]] and [[syntax diagram]]s.

==Semantics==
Semantically many statements differ from [[subroutine]] calls by their handling of [[Parameter (computer science)|parameters]]. Usually an actual subroutine parameter is evaluated once before the subroutine is called. This contrasts to many statement parameters that can be evaluated several times (e.g. the condition of a [[while loop]]) or not at all (e.g. the loop body of a while loop). Technically such statement parameters are [[call-by-name]] parameters. Call-by-name parameters are evaluated when needed (see also [[lazy evaluation]]). When call-by-name parameters are available a statement like behaviour can be implemented with subroutines (see [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]). For languages without call-by-name parameters the semantic description of a [[Control flow#Loops|loop]] or [[Conditional (programming)|conditional]] is usually beyond the capabilities of the language. Therefore, standard documents often refer to semantic descriptions in natural language.

==Expressions==
In most languages, statements contrast with [[expression (programming)|expression]]s in that statements do not return results and are executed solely for their [[side effect (programming)|side effect]]s, while expressions always return a result and often do not have side effects at all. Among imperative programming languages, [[Algol 68]] is one of the few in which a statement can return a result. In languages that mix imperative and [[functional programming|functional]] styles, such as the [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] family, the distinction between expressions and statements is not made: even expressions executed in sequential contexts solely for their side effects and whose return values are not used are considered 'expressions'. In [[purely functional programming]], there are no statements; everything is an expression.

This distinction is frequently observed in wording: a statement is ''executed'', while an expression is ''evaluated''. This is found in the &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[eval]]&lt;/code&gt; functions found in some languages: in Python both are found, with &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; applied to statements and &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; applied to expressions.

==Extensibility==

Most languages have a fixed set of statements defined by the language, but there have been experiments with [[extensible languages]] that allow the programmer to define new statements.

'''''The Creation of Meaning''''' ({{lang-it|'''La creazione di significato'''}}) is a 2014 [[experimental film]] directed by [[Simone Rapisarda Casanova]].

== Plot summary ==

An elderly shepherd, Pacifico Pieruccioni, is forced by the economic crisis to give up his house and land in the Italian mountains, where his parents had fought in the [[Italian resistance movement|Resistance]] against the German Army during [[World War II]]. Oddly enough, the prospective buyer is a young German. The two of them start a conversation about history and present-day [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.villagevoice.com/film/shepherd-doc-the-creation-of-meaning-finds-majesty-in-a-vanishing-way-of-life-8025200 |title = Shepherd Doc ‘The Creation of Meaning’ Finds Majesty in a Vanishing Way of Life |website = The Village Voice |access-date = 12 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url= https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/the-creation-of-meaning-review-1201470912/ | title = Film Review: ‘The Creation of Meaning’ |website = Variety |access-date = 12 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

'''The Creation of Meaning''' is the second feature film by [[Simone Rapisarda Casanova]]. It is set and shot in the [[Apuan Alps]], the landscape once crossed by the [[Gothic Line]]. The film is an experimental hybrid fiction-documentary inspired by [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s short story [[The Aleph (short story)|The Aleph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/movies/review-the-creation-of-meaning-views-an-economically-torn-italy-in-echoes-of-earlier-days.html?_r=0 |title = Review: ‘The Creation of Meaning’ Views an Economically Torn Italy in Echoes of Earlier Days |website = The New York Times | date = 16 December 2015 |access-date = 12 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapisarda Casanova’s stylistic hallmarks include his elliptical, [[metacinematic]] approach to storytelling, his unconventional use of non-actors, his use of natural light and colour inspired by [[renaissance]] paintings,&lt;ref name="fmm"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://filmmakermagazine.com/94398-discovering-the-spiritus-loci-simone-rapisarda-casanova-on-the-creation-of-meaning/#.Vzhq8iOLQy4|title = Discovering the Spiritus Loci: Simone Rapisarda Casanova on The Creation of Meaning |website = Filmmaker Magazine |access-date = 15 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with meticulously-composed static single-takes and [[diegetic]] soundscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://cinema-scope.com/cinema-scope-magazine/pacificos-heights-simone-rapisarda-casanova-creation-meaning/ | title = Pacifico’s Heights: Simone Rapisarda Casanova on The Creation of Meaning |website = Cinemascope |access-date = 15 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His approach to filmmaking is mostly process-driven, after careful research of the thematic base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.mediterraneaonline.eu/la-creazione-di-significato | language = it | title = La creazione di significato | website = Mediterraneaonline.eu |access-date = 15 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent behind such stylistic and methodological choices is to create a cinematic occasion where people and places may reveal their deepest nature.&lt;ref name="av"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.austinvida.com/entertainment/2012/interview-filmmaker-simone-rapisarda-casanova/ | title = A tree that’s no longer there: An interview with filmmaker Simone Rapisarda Casanova | website = Austin Vida | date = 2012 | access-date = 25 May 2016 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160603231919/http://www.austinvida.com/entertainment/2012/interview-filmmaker-simone-rapisarda-casanova/ | archivedate = 3 June 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Nathaniel Solon was charged on January 18, 2007 by the indictment with possessing child pornography. On October 2, 2007, he pleaded guilty. When he came back for another hearing on January 8, 2008, however, Solon stated that he was an innocent man, and the only reason that he had pleaded guilty in the first place was because he believed that he did not have the financial resources to hire an expert witness to investigate his defense. In regard to his explanation, the court appointed him a private attorney to represent him. With the court's approval, Solon was able to request an expert witness, with an investigation budget of $20,000 supplied by the court.

The '''Warlocks of Chiloé''' ("Brujo de Chiloé" or "Brujo chilote" in the [[Spanish language]]) are semi-mythical characters in [[Chilote mythology]] and folklore who are equivalent to "male [[witch]]es", and considered very powerful [[warlock]]s and [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]]s. The [[witchcraft]] of the [[Chiloé Archipelago]] has been practiced for ages, still a widespread belief among the population of the [[Chiloé]], in [[Chile]].

When the Spanish arrived in land of ''[[huilliche]]s'' ([[Mapudungun]] means "southern people"), the [[kalku]]s and [[Machi (Shaman)|Machis]] had already been long established. In many cases when a Machi cured some incurable disease, their fame spread to far distant places.  Also when a kalku from malevolent clans cast spells so intense that it drove more than one enemy mad no other doctor could help apart from members of a friendly tribe.

In the eighteenth century, José de Moraleda wished to prove his proficiency to these ''huilliches'' and establish that he was the most formidable sorcerer in the world.  The locals didn't believe him and called upon the ''[[Machi (Shaman)|Machi]]'' Chilpilla, who lived in Quetalco, to confront this intruder to their lands.  Moraleda was defeated and in recognition of this offered the Machi an enormous book of ancient witchcraft around the world.  Further, Moraleda wrote that the natives of Chiloé were not as deplorable as he had believed and, in fact, were even better than some Chileans. This being the origin story of the "Warlock of Chiloé." A [[Brujo de Chiloé]]. 

Modern day folklore throughout the archipelago of Chiloé says that there are Machis from who cure diseases which many doctors have considered untreatable, along with incurable misfortune from certain curses inflicted by "Warlock of Chiloé" of some black sect on persons who were defenseless from such spells.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In the folklore of chiloé, also says that the evil "''Warlock of Chiloé''" sail in "''the [[Caleuche]]''" (a mythical and scary ghost ship).

''Wisden'' was founded in 1864 by the English cricketer [[John Wisden]] (1826–84) as a competitor to [[Fred Lillywhite]]'s ''[[The Guide to Cricketers]]''.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news|last=Engel|first=Matthew|title=Words on the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/d8db2bd8-9c44-11e2-ba3c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Pl2FCTpt|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=ft.com|date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its annual publication has continued uninterrupted to the present day, making it the longest running sports annual in history. The sixth edition was the first published under its current title; the first five were published as ''The Cricketer'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s''' Almanack'', with the [[apostrophe]] before the "s".

[[Charles Pardon]], with [[George Kelly King]], founded the [[Cricket Reporting Agency]] (CRA) in 1880. From Pardon's becoming editor of ''Wisden'' in 1887, the editor was nearly always a CRA partner and the CRA was responsible for the editorial production of the ''Almanack'', until in 1965 it merged with the [[Press Association]] (PA).&lt;ref&gt;''Preface to the 1966 Edition'' by Norman Preston, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1966 Edition pp vi–vii. Sporting Handbooks Ltd. 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wisden'' was acquired and published by [[Robert Maxwell]]'s publishing conglomerate, Macdonald, in the 1970s. Cricket fan [[John Paul Getty, Jr.|Sir John Paul Getty, Jr.]], bought the company, John Wisden &amp; Co., in 1993&lt;ref name=ft/&gt; and in December 2008 it was sold to [[A&amp;C Black]], which is owned by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]. The company presented the [[Wisden Trophy]], for Test matches between [[English cricket team|England]] and [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]], in 1963 to celebrate its 100th edition.

In 2013, a history of ''Wisden'' was published: ''The Little Wonder: The Remarkable History of Wisden'', by [[Robert Winder]] ({{ISBN|978-1408136263}}). "The Little Wonder" was John Wisden's nickname.

==Editions==
''Wisden'' is a small-paged but a very thick book (over 1,500 pages in modern editions) with a distinctive bright yellow cover that it has carried since the 75th edition in 1938. Prior to that, covers varied between yellow, buff and salmon pink. That edition was also the first to display the famous [[woodcut]] of two cricketers, by [[Eric Ravilious]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155556.html ''Wisden Almanack'' | | ESPN Cricinfo]. Content-www.cricinfo.com (1 January 1970). Retrieved on 21 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; on its cover. It is published each April, just before the start of the English domestic cricket season. Since 2003 the woodcut has been replaced as the main feature of the front cover by a photograph of a current cricketer, but still appears albeit in a much reduced size.

It is produced in both hardcover and softcover versions. Since 2006, a larger format edition has been published on an experimental basis. This is said to be in response to requests from readers who find the print size of the standard edition hard to read. It is around twice the traditional size and was published in a limited edition of 5,000. It is not a [[large print]] book as such, as the print will still be of a size found in many standard books.

From 2011 an Epub version, ''The Shorter Wisden'', has been available in online bookstores. Described by the publishers as a "distillation of what's best in its bigger brother", it includes the Notes by the Editor, all the articles, reviews and obituaries and the reports on all England's Test matches for the year in question. Excluded are the statistics and other cricket reports contained within the ''Almanack'' proper.
 
The format has changed markedly over the years. The first edition had only 112 pages yet found space to cover the dates of battles in the [[English Civil War]], the winners of [[The Oaks Stakes|The Oaks]] and the rules of [[quoiting]].

==Contents==
The contents of a contemporary edition include the following sections:

===Comment===
Around a hundred pages of articles on cricketing topics, including the introductory "Notes by the Editor", which address often controversial cricket issues and always provoke discussion in the cricketing world.

===Awards===
The traditional [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] awards, which date back to 1889, and the [[Wisden Leading Cricketer of the World]] award, started in 2004.

===Records===
Traditionally the main source for key statistics about the game, although it has never attempted to be comprehensive. Nowadays the records section is intended to be complementary to the much more detailed data available online at ''Wisden'''s associated website [[ESPNcricinfo]].

===English cricket===
By far the largest section of the book. Hugely detailed coverage, including scorecards of every [[First-class cricket|First class]] game played in the previous English summer, and summaries of [[Minor counties of English cricket|minor counties]], second eleven, university, school and premier [[club cricket]], as well as the [[Village Cup]].

===Overseas cricket===
Full coverage of all international cricket and brief coverage of domestic first class cricket outside England.

===Law and administration===
This short section, 80 pages in the 2010 edition, has information about and addresses of official cricket bodies as well as the full [[laws of cricket]], together with appendices. There are also details of meetings held by official bodies, including their major decisions, as well as articles about the [[Duckworth–Lewis method]] and [[Powerplay (cricket)|Powerplays]]. The laws have been omitted from the most recent editions.

===The Wisden Review===
This section includes the Chronicle (noteworthy events from the previous year), reviews of other cricket books published in the year, noteworthy retirements and the highly regarded obituaries section among others.

====Book reviews and the Wisden Book of the Year====

[[John Arlott]] wrote the Books section from its inception in the 1950 edition until the 1992 edition, just before he died. Beginning with the 1993 edition the Books section has been written by a different person each year, often someone "with a literary reputation first and a separate enthusiasm for cricket".&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Engel]], Preface, ''Wisden'' 1993, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The first such reviewer was [[J. L. Carr]], and others have included [[Sebastian Faulks]] (1997) and [[Leslie Thomas]] (1998).

An award for the '''Wisden Book of the Year''' was inaugurated in the 2003 edition. The winners have been:

==Contributors==
''Wisden'' has had a large number of contributors. The majority involve match reports for the various fixtures recorded each year, but also biographies, reviews and opinion. Many great cricket writers have written for ''Wisden'', along with many great cricketers. [[Neville Cardus]] contributed many notable essays and for many years [[John Arlott]] was responsible for the book reviews.

==Five Cricketers of the Year==
Since 1902 (with the occasional exception) ''Wisden'' has honoured five cricketers for their outstanding achievements over the previous year. Further details, with a full list of recipients of the award, can be found at [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]].

==Indices and anthologies==

==Style, design, graphical content and materials==
For the first 32 years of its existence the ''Almanack'' was only published in softback form, in a paper cover that varied in colour through the years between shades of pink, yellow and buff. From the 33rd (1896) edition onwards hardback copies became available at twice the price of the softback.

In 1889 the ''Almanack'' published its first photoplate, commissioned to accompany the Editor's nomination of six great Bowlers of the Year. From then on a photoplate appeared each year up to and including 1915. The plates were attached to an un-numbered page in the ''Almanack'' and had a tissue protector. They continued to show a number of selected players of the year except in 1896, when [[W G Grace]] was the only subject, and in 1913, when the 50th edition published no selections but celebrated [[John Wisden]] himself. After a two-year hiatus during World War 1 the plate reappeared in 1918, but as a mechanically printed image depicting five School Bowlers of the Year. The image in the 1919 edition continued to reflect wartime exigencies with its five Public School Cricketers of the Year before normal service resumed in 1920 with five Batsmen of the Year. From then on, with four exceptions (see [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]]), the norm was to include an image of five Cricketers of the Year. It was not until 1938 that other photographs were introduced.

From 1933 to 1939 the softback editions of the ''Almanack'' contained a cricket bat bookmark attached by the blade to the inside of the spine with yellow string. The bat handle of the bookmark is easily lost and softbacks with entirely intact bookmarks command a price premium.

In 1938 the ''Almanack'' underwent some significant style, design and material changes under the supervision of [[Robert Harling (typographer)|Robert Henry Harling]].&lt;ref&gt;Obituaries. ''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'' 2009 edition, p1605&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced a new typeface and new designs for the front covers of both the softback and hardback editions. A yellow linen cover featuring the iconic woodcut by [[Eric Ravilious]] replaced the paper wrapper of the softback edition – a reason why softbacks from this time onwards are often referred to as "linens" even though they changed to a cloth-effect card binding in 1957. The design of the softback from 1938 onwards is probably the one most associated with the word "Wisden" in the mind of the general public.

There was a change to the orientation of the gilt lettering on the spines of hardbacks from 1941 to 1948. This was probably required by, and then a relict of, the slimness of the volumes published during World War 2. Excepting the 1963 centenary softback, the external appearance of both types of the ''Almanack'' then remained substantially unchanged until 1965 when the hardback was issued with a dust jacket. This was printed on yellow paper with the same design as the softback, giving a uniformity of appearance to both formats.

Between 1965 and 1978 the woodcut and text elements of the softback covers and the hardback dust jackets were printed in a variety of colours before reverting to black on yellow from 1979 onwards. Since that time some other changes have occurred to the style, design and materials:

*Between 1982 and 1984 the hardback dust jackets were printed on white paper
*Colour photographs first appeared in the ''Almanack'' in 1988
*From 1994 the hardback dust jackets were laminated, making them more resistant to wear and tear
*In 2001 the layout of the front board of the hardback was changed
*In 2003 a new style of photo dust jacket was introduced, although readers were informed that those who preferred the "traditional cover" could order one free from the publisher. This offer did not last: from the following year onwards a charge was made for providing these covers.

Minor changes of style have taken place throughout the ''Almanack''{{'}}s history, and are documented in a collector's guide that was updated and reprinted in 2011.&lt;ref name="Rice &amp; Renshaw 2011"&gt;''The Wisden Collector's Guide'' by Jonathan Rice and Andrew Renshaw. John Wisden 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facsimile editions==

Due to their rarity the early editions of ''Wisden'', and editions published during the two World Wars, are rare and expensive. However, every edition up to 1946 is also available in facsimile form.

The first facsimile set was printed by Billing &amp; Sons in 1960. Approximately 150 softback copies were produced of each year from 1864 to 1878 and made available either as part of a set or as singles. The facsimiles are clearly marked with an entry in capital letters at the bottom of the title page: "Facsimile edition 1960 made and printed in Great Britain by Billing and Sons Ltd., Guildford and London".

Lowe and Brydone produced another print run of the first 15 years in 1974. The run was limited again to 150 softback sets. These facsimiles are marked with an entry in capital letters at the bottom of the title page: "Second facsimile edition made and printed in Great Britain by Lowe and Brydone (Printers) Limited".

In 1991 John Wisden &amp; Co Ltd produced its own facsimile set in a distinctive yellow box. This again comprised editions from 1864 to 1878 inclusive and was limited to 1000 sets. The individual books are not strictly facsimiles, and cannot be mistaken for originals, because although they include a copy of the original covers they are hardbound in red boards with "''WISDEN'' FACSIMILE" in gilt on the front and the set number – "No. X of 1000" – on the back. Internally there is also an entry to the effect that the editions are facsimiles at the bottom of each title page: "This facsimile edition is published in 1991 by John Wisden &amp; Co. Ltd. and printed by The Eastern Press Ltd., Reading".

In recent years a more extensive range of facsimiles has been produced by the Willows Publishing Company Ltd. As of early 2014, softback and hardback editions up to and including 1946 have been published. Like the ''Wisden'' facsimile set, the Willows softback facsimiles up to 1937 are hardbound, in tan cloth with gilt embossing, but from 1938 onwards they are true facsimiles with yellow linen covers. The hardback editions are also true facsimiles, with dark brown covers upon which the original gilt embossing is reproduced. Internally all Willows editions are identified as reprints at the base of the title page and limited edition numbers, where applicable, are also marked on the binding or cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowsreprints.com/ Willows Publishing Company] Retrieved 6 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The first three facsimile sets reproduced the wrong back cover for the 1878 edition – they incorrectly showed a list of articles supplied by John Wisden &amp; Co. The Willows facsimile contains the correct advertisement, for a book on Oxford and Cambridge cricket matches from 1827 to 1876.

To celebrate the 150th edition, a facsimile of the 1864 edition was offered by John Wisden &amp; Co as an incentive for those who subscribed to both the 2013 and 2014 editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.bloomsbury.com/rep/files/wisdena5leaflet.pdf Bloomsbury marketing leaflet] Retrieved 6 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The facsimile offer was repeated in 2014 for those willing to subscribe to the ''Almanack'' by direct debit. This is not a true facsimile as the back cover does not reproduce the "List of Articles" of the original, but instead on the inside there is an advertisement for ''Wisden'' reprints from the Willows Publishing Company and on the back a celebration of 150 years of ''Wisden''. At the bottom of the back cover information is provided about the reprint: "This reprint of the first edition of ''Wisden'' was produced in 2013 for the publisher, John Wisden &amp; Co, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. Printed and bound by MPG Books."

Facsimile dust jackets are available for editions of ''Wisden'' from 1965 to 2003 to replace those that have been lost or damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportspages.com/wisden/wisden_dust_jackets/ ''Wisden'' Dust Jackets at Sportspages] Retrieved 10 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; They are also offered from 2004 onward as "traditional covers" that can be substituted for the original photo dust jackets. Supplied by ''Wisden''{{'}}s "official dust jacket supplier", these jackets are laminated and are printed in black on yellow (unlike the original jackets issued with the editions from 1965 to 1978 that incorporated colour elements). Replacement dust jackets are also clearly distinguishable from the originals as they are marked on the back cover with the words "REPLACEMENT DUST JACKET".

The same supplier offers traditional design dust jackets for editions from 1946 to 1964. Although these mimic the appearance of the softback covers they are not true facsimiles as the original hardback editions were never issued with dust jackets.

==Print runs==

The size of ''Wisden'' print runs is of considerable interest to collectors as rarity has a very strong influence on the value of individual editions.

The most reliable, or rather most widely quoted, source of information on print runs is an article by Leslie Gutteridge titled "A History of ''Wisden''" published in the 1963 ''Almanack''.&lt;ref name="Gutteridge 1963"&gt;''A History of Wisden'' by L. E. S. Gutteridge, ''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'' 1963 Edition pp 74–88. Sporting Handbooks Ltd. 1963&lt;/ref&gt; In this article the writer states that it had proved impossible to trace any printing orders earlier than 1936, having earlier mentioned that records had been lost during the Second World War as a result of two attacks on the publisher and Wisden's Mortlake factory.

Despite the lack of early records Gutteridge notes that editions from 1889 to 1901, except 1896 and 1900, ran to two impressions (''the word "impression" rather than "edition" is used throughout this section to avoid confusion with Wisden's use of "edition" in the book's title''). He also notes in passing the rarity of the 1875 edition, though "not ... so scarce as the first issue of 1864", without providing specific details.

It is for the years from 1936 onwards that Gutteridge puts numbers to the print runs, providing either combined figures, or a breakdown of softback and/or hardback numbers, for each year to 1949:

{|
|-
! Year&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; !! &amp;nbsp;Total&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; !! Softback&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; !! Hardback

|}

After 1949 he notes that numbers diminished, although at the time he wrote the article sales of the softback and hardback editions were still 11,000 and 10,000 respectively. It is likely that these figures were greatly exceeded in the centenary year as the 1963 edition ran to three impressions.

In more recent years sales of the 2006 edition exceeded 50,000 in total.&lt;ref&gt;''Preface to the 2007 Edition'' by Matthew Engel, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2007 Edition p 7. John Wisden &amp; Co Ltd. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the print run was based on the publisher's belief that England's successful [[The Ashes|Ashes]] campaign the previous summer would attract considerable public interest.

Although unsupported by any reliable documentation, it is almost certain that print runs were reduced during the First World War. The 1916 edition, also containing as it does the obituary of [[W G Grace]], is the most expensive 20th century ''Wisden''.

The smallest recent print runs are believed to be for the years 1969 to 1971.

==Collecting ''Wisden''s==

===Collectors and collecting strategies===

Collecting ''Wisden''s is a popular activity among cricket followers, and early editions command high prices. The first edition, only 112 pages long, sold for one [[shilling]]. Rare copies of the early editions can sell for thousands of pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1864 Original Paperback Wisden. The First Edition of Wisden|url=http://www.wisdenauction.com/detail.asp?id=79382|website=www.wisdenauction.com|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resources===

Although devoting most of its pages to a survey of the contents of Wisden from 1864 to 2010, the last 44 pages of ''The Wisden Collector's Guide''&lt;ref name="Rice &amp; Renshaw 2011" /&gt; contains a significant amount of information of interest and practical use to the collector. 

The two main UK-based on-line resources for ''Wisden'' collectors are the Wisdens.org (www.wisden.guru) and ''Wisden'' Collectors Club websites (see External Links). Facilities offered by the former are free of charge and open to all visitors (although its forum requires registration) while the latter charges a nominal annual membership fee for access to its main site.

A ''Wisden'' archive is maintained by ESPNCricinfo (see External Links), offering access to some features, articles and international scores from the first edition onwards. The article "A History of ''Wisden''"&lt;ref name="Gutteridge 1963" /&gt; prepared for the 1963 centenary edition is likely to be of most interest to collectors who do not have access to the original volume.

===Valuations===

A combination of rarity (perceived or known), condition, completeness and originality determines the price a collector is willing to pay for any given edition. Rarity arguably has the strongest influence on value as editions known to be very rare (e.g. those published in the periods when paper restrictions applied during both World Wars) are very much more expensive than comparable editions from the surrounding decades. Editions such as the 1916 containing the obituary and career details of [[W. G. Grace]]; 1934, detailing the '[[Bodyline]]' series of 1932–33; 1949, the Australian '[[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Invincibles]]' tour of 1948; 1965, the first to have a yellow dust jacket: All are rare and expensive for specific reasons.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that participate in the [[Online Computer Library Center]] (OCLC) global cooperative. It is operated by OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc.&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/whatis/|title=What is WorldCat?|work=worldcat.org|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subscribing member libraries collectively maintain WorldCat's [[database]], the world's largest [[bibliographic database]]. OCLC makes WorldCat itself available free to libraries, but the catalog is the foundation for other subscription OCLC services (such as [[interlibrary loan|resource sharing]] and collection management).

==History==
[[OCLC]] was founded in 1967 under the leadership of [[Fred Kilgour]].&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Margalit Fox]] |title=Frederick G. Kilgour, Innovative Librarian, Dies at 92 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/02/us/02kilgour.html |quote=Frederick G. Kilgour, a distinguished librarian who nearly 40 years ago transformed a consortium of Ohio libraries into what is now the largest library cooperative in the world, making the catalogs of thousands of libraries around the globe instantly accessible to far-flung patrons, died on Monday in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 92. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 2, 2006 |accessdate=2009-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, OCLC began to develop the union catalog technology that would later evolve into WorldCat; the first catalog records were added in 1971.&lt;ref name="Fox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/catalog/timeline.en.html |title=A brief history of WorldCat|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=February 10, 2015 |website= oclc.org| accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, OCLC began the "Open WorldCat" pilot program, making abbreviated records from a subset of WorldCat available to partner web sites and booksellers, to increase the accessibility of its subscribing member libraries' collections. In 2006, it became possible to search WorldCat directly at its website. In 2007, WorldCat Identities began providing pages for 20 million "identities", predominantly authors and persons who are the subjects of published titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.oclc.org/content/dam/oclc/publications/newsletters/nextspace/nextspace_006.pdf|title = WorldCat Identities: Another View of the Catalog|last = Hickey|first = Thomas B.|date = 15 April 2007|journal = NextSpace|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 18 January 2016|publisher = OCLC|issue = 6|pages = 18–19|issn = 1559-0011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, WorldCat contained over 400 million bibliographic records in 491 languages, representing over 2.6 billion physical and digital library assets,&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt; and the WorldCat persons dataset ([[Data mining|mined]] from WorldCat) included over 100 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Data strategy [WorldCat] |website=oclc.org |url=https://www.oclc.org/en/worldcat/data-strategy.html |accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
WorldCat operates on a [[batch processing]] model rather than a real-time model. That is, WorldCat records are synchronized at intermittent intervals with the underlying library catalogs instead of real-time or every day. Consequently:
* WorldCat shows that a particular item is owned by a particular library but does not provide that library's [[call number]].
* WorldCat does not indicate whether or not an item is currently borrowed, lost, undergoing restoration or repair, or moved to storage not directly accessible to patrons (thereby forcing interested patrons to submit a retrieval request and wait).
* Furthermore, WorldCat does not show whether or not a library owns multiple copies of a particular title.

As an alternative, WorldCat allows participating institutions to add direct links from WorldCat to their own catalog entries for a particular item, which enables the user to determine its real-time status.&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt; However, this still requires users to open multiple Web pages, each pointing to a different [[Online public access catalog|OPAC]] with its own distinctive user interface design (which places item status in a different portion of the Web browser display), until they can locate a catalog entry that shows the item is currently available at a particular library.
