The '''Menshevik Trial''' was one of the early [[purges]] carried out by [[Stalin]] in which 14 economists, who were former members of the [[Menshevik|Menshevik party]], were put on trial and convicted for trying to re-establish their party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Litvin|first=A.

The presiding judge was [[Nikolay Shvernik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NEW MASS TRIAL IN MOSCOW |work=[[Aberdeen Journal]] |date=2 March 1931 |accessdate=17 May 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000577/19310302/060/0007| publisher = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defendants==
The defendants were:
{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}
* [[Boris Berlatsky]]
* [[Aleksandr Finn-Enotaevsky]]
* [[Abram Ginzburg]]
* [[Vladimir Groman]]
* [[Mikhail Yakubovich]]
* [[Vladimir Ikov]]
* [[Kirill Petunin]]
* [[Isaak Illich Rubin]]
* [[Vasili Sher]]
* [[Aron Sokolovsky]]
* [[Nikolai Sukhanov]]
* [[Moisei Teitelbaum]]
* [[Ivan Volkov]]
* [[Lazar Zalkind]]
{{div col end}}

Six out of the fourteen defendants were Jews. It was suggested in [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bundist]] circles that this large proportion of Jews among the accused had been specially arranged to organize feeling against the Jewish Socialists. This was denied by Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/1931/03/07/archive/menshevik-trial-in-moscow-arranged-specially-as-move-to-work-up-soviet-feeling-against-jews-berlin-b Menshevik Trial in Moscow Arranged Specially As Move to Work Up Soviet Feeling Against Jews], [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], 7 March 1931&lt;/ref&gt;

==The trial==
The defendants were accused of setting up the "All-Union Bureau of Mensheviks." [[Vladimir Groman]] gave a public testimony that he and [[Vladimir Bazarov]] (who was not on trial) headed a counterrevolutionary group in [[Gosplan]], purportedly organized in 1923, which attempted at "influencing the economic policy of the Soviet authorities so as to hold the position of 1923–25."&lt;ref&gt;Jasny, ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties,'' pg. 136, citing the transcript of Groman's trial testimony published in ''Protsess kontrrevoliutsionnoi organizatsii Men'shevikov (1 marta—9 marta 1931): Stenogragramma sudebnogo protsessa.'' Moscow: Sovetskoe Zakonodatel'stvo, 1931; pg. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Groman, being a member of the Presidium of the Gosplan the star figure among the accused, damned himself and his colleagues with testimony that at Gosplan they had spent their time

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Putting into the control figures and into the surveys of current business planning ideas and deliberately distorted appraisals antagonistic to the [[General line of the party|general Party line]] (lowering the rates of expansion of socialist construction, distorting the class approach, exaggerating the difficulties), stressing the signs of an impending catastrophe (Groman) or, what is close to this, assigning a negligible chance of success to the Party line directed toward the socialist attack (Bazarov, Gukhman)&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Naum Jasny, ''Soviet Industrialization, 1928–1952.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961; pg. 69, quoting ''Protsess kontrrevoliutsionnoi organizatsii Men'shevikov,'' pg. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Final day==
On the final day, the prisoners made confessions of their "crimes". "In the last minutes before my death", one of them was quoted saying, "I will think with disgust of the evil I have wrought; evil for which not we, but foreign Menshevists and the [[Second International]] must share responsibility."

[[Nikolai Krylenko]], the Public Prosecutor, declared that Groman, Sher, Yakubovitch, Ginzburg, and Sukhanov were the principal leaders of the counter-revolutionary organization, and therefore, must suffer the death penalty. For the others he asked that they should be isolated "for long periods".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MOSCOW TRIAL ENDED |work=Western Morning News |date=9 March 1931 |access-date=17 May 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000329/19310309/069/0007| publisher = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verdict==
At 9 March 1931, after deliberating for twenty-five hours, the court sentenced seven defendants to ten years' imprisonment. The seven other defendants were sentenced to different terms of imprisonment, ranging from five to eight years. Those who received the ten years' sentence were Groman, Sher, Sukhanov, Ginzburg, Jakobovich, Petunina, and Finn-Enotaevsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MOSCOW TRIAL ENDS |work=[[Aberdeen Journal]] |date=10 March 1931 |accessdate=16 May 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000577/19310310/082/0007| publisher = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
[[Raphael Abramovitch|Rafail Abramovich]], a prominent Menshevik in exile in [[Berlin]], helped to mobilise Western socialist and labour support for the persecuted economists. At a rally in Berlin, organised by the [[SPD]], he denied there was an underground Menshevik organisation that existed in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=Abramovich&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abramovich|first=Rafail|title=Against Fascism and Bolshevik Slander!|url=http://www.korolevperevody.co.uk/abramovich01.html|journal=Sotsialistichesky Vestnik|date=14 March 1931|issue=5 (243)|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Trotsky]] also commented on the trial, condemning both Stalin and the Mensheviks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Trotsky]]; [https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1931/xx/mensh-trial.htm The Trial of the Russian Mensheviks; The Real Disposition of the Figures on the Political Scene]; ''[[The Militant]]'', Vol. IV No. 8, 15 April 1931, p. 3. via the ''Leon Trotsky Internet Archive'' ([[marxists.org]])&lt;/ref&gt;

It started on October 25, 1918 as a result of [[prodrazvyorstka]] policy. On November 10 rebels took the town of [[Arsk]]. Red guards with cannons were sent to suppress the rebellion. On November 15 the rebellion was defeated, 31 rebels were killed, 11 wounded. The participants of the rebellion repaid a contribution to the Soviet power.

'''Asger Oluf Jorn''' (3 March 1914 – 1 May 1973) was a [[Danish people|Danish]] painter, sculptor, [[ceramic artist]], and author. He was a founding member of the avant-garde movement [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] and the [[Situationist International]]. He was born in [[Vejrum]], in the northwest corner of [[Jutland]], [[Denmark]], and baptized '''Asger Oluf Jørgensen'''.

The largest collection of Asger Jorn's works—including his major work ''[[Stalingrad (painting)|Stalingrad]]''—can be seen in the [[Museum Jorn, Silkeborg]], [[Denmark]].

Asger Jorn willed his property and the works of art located inside to the Municipality of Albissola Marina (Savona), so that the italian museum called "Casa Museo Jorn" was created for displaying his works [http://www.amicidicasajorn.it/index.php/it/]

==Early life==
He was the second oldest of six children, an elder brother to [[Jørgen Nash]]. Both of his parents were teachers. His father, Lars Peter Jørgensen, a [[fundamentalist]] Christian, died in a car crash when Asger was 12 years old. His mother, Maren, ''née'' Nielsen, was more liberal but nevertheless a deeply committed Christian. This early heavy Christian influence had a negative effect on Asger who began progressively to inwardly rebel against it, and more generally against other forms of authority.

In 1929, aged 15, he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]], although he made a recovery from it after spending three months on the west coast of Jutland. By the age of 16 he was influenced by [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]], and although he had already started to paint, Asger enrolled in the Vinthers Seminarium, a teacher-training college in [[Silkeborg]] where he paid particular attention to a course in 19th century [[Scandinavia]]n thought. Also at about this time Jorn became the subject of a number of oil paintings by the painter Martin Kaalund-Jørgensen, which encouraged Jorn to try his hand in this medium.

== Early career ==
When he graduated from college in 1935, the principal wrote a reference for him which said that he had attained 'an extraordinary rich personal development and maturity' – especially because of his wide reading in areas outside the topics required for his studies. While at college he joined the small Silkeborg branch of the [[Communist Party of Denmark]] and came under the direct influence of the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] Christian Christensen, with whom he became close friends and who, Jorn was later to write, was to become a second father to him.&lt;ref name=Baumeister&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larkin|first1=Ruth Baumeister; Paul|title=Fraternité avant tout. Asger Jorn's writings on art and architecture, 1938-1957.|date=2011|publisher=Uitgeverij 010|location=Rotterdam|isbn=9789064507601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 he traveled (on a [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] motorbike he had scraped together enough money to buy) to Paris to become a student of [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]. However, when he discovered that Kandinsky was having economic difficulties, barely able to sell his own paintings, Jorn decided to join [[Fernand Léger]]'s ''[[Académie Contemporaine]]''; it was during this period that he turned away from figurative painting and to abstract art. In 1937 he joined [[Le Corbusier]] in working on the [[Pavillon des Temps Nouveaux]] at the [[1937 Paris Exhibition]]. He returned again to Denmark in the summer of 1937. He again traveled to Paris in the summer of 1938, before returning to Denmark, traveling to [[Løkken-Vrå|Løkken]], [[Silkeborg]] and [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Guy. ''Asger Jorn'', [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Asger Jorn was a good friend of the Danish art dealer Børge Birch, owner of Galerie Birch, who sold his art as early as the 1930s. Later on Jorn held many group exhibitions and solo exhibitions in different galleries.

From 1937 to 1942, he studied at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] in Copenhagen.

== World War II ==
The occupation of Denmark by Nazi Germany was a time of deep crisis for Jorn, who had been deeply inculcated with pacifism. The occupation initially sank him into deep depression. He subsequently became active in the communist [[resistance movement]]. During the war he also co-founded with the architect Robert Dahlmann Olsen the underground art group, [[Helhesten]] or "hell-horse," and was a contributor to its journal. In 1939, he wrote the key theoretical essay, "Intimate Banalities," published in [[Helhesten]], which claimed that the future of art was kitsch and praised amateur landscape paintings as "the best art today." He was also the first person to translate [[Franz Kafka]] into Danish.

== Post-war ==
After the war, he complained that opportunities for critical thinking within the context of the communist arena had been curtailed by what he characterised as a centralised bourgeois political control. Finding this unacceptable, he broke with the [[Communist Party of Denmark]], although he did not hand in his membership until the mid-1960s and remained committed philosophically to a revision of the Marxist analysis of capitalism from the point of view of the artist.

He traveled again to France where he, together with [[Christian Dotremont]] and [[Constant Nieuwenhuys|Constant]], founded [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] (a European [[avant-garde]] [[art movement]]), and edited monographs of the Bibliothèque Cobra.

He returned, impoverished and seriously ill with tuberculosis, to Silkeborg in 1951 and resumed work in the ceramics field in 1953. The following year he traveled to [[Albissola Marina]] in Italy where he became involved with an offshoot of COBRA, the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]].

===Situationist International===
In 1954 he met [[Guy Debord]], who was to become a close friend. The two men collaborated on two [[artist's book]]s, ''[[Mémoires#Fin de Copenhague|Fin de Copenhagen]]'' (1957) and ''[[Mémoires]]'' (1959), along with prints, and forewords to each other's work.

[[File:Pamphlets by Unpopular Books.jpg|thumb|right|English translation of ''Creation Ouvert'' published by [[Unpopular Books]]]]
He participated in the conference that led to the merger of the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]], the [[Lettriste Internationale]], and [[London Psychogeographical Association]] to form the [[Situationist International]] in 1957. Here he applied his scientific and mathematical knowledge drawn from [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Niels Bohr]] to develop his [[situlogy|situlogical]] technique. Jorn never believed in a conception of the Situationist ideas as exclusively artistic and separated from political involvement. He was at the root and at the core of the Situationist International project, fully sharing the revolutionary intentions with Debord.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mario Lippolis]] (2000) ''Notizie su Asger Jorn, situazionista iperpolitico'' published in Asper Jorn ''La comunità prodiga'' (edited by Mario Lippolis). Publisher: Zona, Rapallo, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mario Lippolis]] (2000) ''Un dialogo tra vandali civilizzatori nello sfacelo dell’impero della merce'' published in Asper Jorn ''La comunità prodiga'' (edited by Mario Lippolis). Publisher: Zona, Rapallo, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The Situationist general principles were an attack on the capitalist exploitation and degradation of the life of people, and solution of alternative life experiences, construction of situations, unitary urbanism, psychogeography, with the union of play, freedom and critical thinking. Such general principles were applied by Jorn to painting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francesco Poli|Poli, F.]] (1991), ''Sulla scia dei surrealisti'', published in ''I Situazionisti e la loro storia''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 he amicably quit his activity in the SI, still fully supporting its contents and goals, and continuing to support it financially, but believing that the new strategy of the SI was ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonardo Lippolis]] (2000) ''Togliti i baffi, ti abbiamo riconosciuto'' – La vera storia di un bluff (il Luther Blissett Project e i suoi padrini) e della sua cattiva coscienza (l’Internazionale Situazionista)”. Published in journal ''Invarianti'' n. 34, 2000, section ''Una lezione di ripasso della storia'' quote: &lt;blockquote&gt;nella realtà storica,dopo le finte dimissioni del 1961, Keller-Jorn si era appena amichevolmente defilato dalle attività dell’IS, appoggiandone in pieno i contenuti e gli scopi (al punto da continuare a finanziarle), ma giudicandone poco efficace la nuova strategia.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jorn, Asger [1964] ''[http://www.notbored.org/cursed.html Guy Debord and the Problem of the Accursed]'' published in book ''[[Contre le Cinema]]'' (1964, [[Institute for Comparative Vandalism]] ). Translated from the French by Roxanne Lapidus.&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to found the [[Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism]] in [[Silkeborg]] and contributed material to the ''[[Situationist Times]]''. Later, he donated a museum for modern art to the Danish town of [[Silkeborg]], near where he grew up. He was to remain close to Debord, however, and continued to fund Situationist publications.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Guy. ''Asger Jorn, the Crucial Years 1954–64'', Lund Humphries 1977, p 57&lt;/ref&gt;

His philosophical system [[Trivalent logic|Triolectics]] was given a practical manifestation through the development of [[three sided football]].

=== Later years ===
His first American solo exhibition was at the Lefebre Gallery in 1962. After 1966, Jorn continued to produce oil paintings while traveling throughout Europe collecting images with photographer Gerard Francesci for his vast archive of "10,000 Years of Nordic Folk Art". He traveled extensively, to Cuba, England, and the far east. Jorn traveled to the United States for the only time in 1970, for a gallery opening at Lefebre Gallery. He had earlier asserted that he refused to travel to a country that made visitors sign a statement maintaining that they were not communists.

In 1964, he was awarded a [[Guggenheim Award]] including a generous cash prize, by an international jury assembled by [[Lawrence Alloway]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Times]] (1964) ''[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D1FF7385C147A93C5A8178AD85F408685F9 Guggenheim Prize Of $2,500 Refused By Danish Painter]''. 17 January 1964, Friday. Section: Business Financial, Page 41&lt;/ref&gt; The following day Jorn sent this telegram to the president of the Guggenheim, [[Harry Frank Guggenheim|Harry F. Guggenheim]]:&lt;ref&gt;Guy Debord, Correspondence, vol. 2 ("September 1960 – December 1964"), ed. Patrick Mosconi, Paris, Librairie Artheme Fayard, 2001, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom McDonough]] (2002) p.6&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Asger Jorn's telegram.jpg|thumb|Asger Jorn's telegram to Guggenheim.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;GO TO HELL WITH YOUR MONEY BASTARD—STOP—REFUSE PRICE (sic) —STOP—NEVER ASKED FOR IT—STOP—AGAINST ALL DECENSY (sic) MIX ARTIST AGAINST HIS WILL IN YOUR PUBLICITY—STOP—I WANT PUBLIC CONFIRMATION NOT TO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN YOUR RIDICULOUS GAME JORN&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the course of his artistic career he produced over 2,500 paintings, prints, drawings, ceramics, sculptures, artist's books, collages, décollages, and collaborative tapestries.

He died in [[Aarhus]], Denmark on 1 May 1973. He is buried in the cemetery at [[Grötlingbo Church]], on the island of Gotland in Sweden.

==Writing==

=== Luck and Chance: Dagger and Guitar (1952) ===
The first edition of ''Luck and Chance'' was Jorn's first published book, issued privately to subscribers in 1952. It was written at the Silkeborg Sanatorium during his convalescence from a serious attack of tuberculosis aggravated by malnutrition and scurvy. Later in the process, it also became intended as a doctoral dissertation which was refused by a professor of philosophy at Copenhagen University. It is, amongst other things, a critique of Kierkegaard's triad of aesthetic, ethical and religious stages, and of his definition of truth. Another powerful influence appears to be present in ghostly form : Friedrich Nietzsche. It is one of the most fundamental texts to understand Jorn's undertaking of "a reconstruction of philosophy from the point of view of an artist".

=== Value and Economy ===
'''Critique of Political Economy and the Exploitation of the Unique (1961)'''
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}
This book consists of two parts. The first is a concise critique of the apparent contradictions in Marx's ''Das Kapital'' which Jorn uses to prepare the ground for a discussion of how the work of "the creative elite" can have "value" in any future society aligned on communist principles. This was originally published in French in 1959 by the ''Internationale Situationniste'' and is the most straightforward and least discursive of all of Jorn's texts, probably because Guy Debord had a hand in the editing. The second part is a long polemic against contemporaneous Russian revisionism and the failed attempt by Denmark and Britain to join the Common Market, before coming to Jorn's main proposal, an economically independent international "creative elite" adopting typical Scandinavian institutions to realize "artistic value" for the greater universal good. He also attempts to reconcile the unique and individual position of the "creative elite" with his socialist principles. The second part alternates between objective and subjective modes.

=== The Natural Order (1962) ===
:''If this is a critique of [[Niels Bohr]]'s theory of [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]], then it is also to just the same high degree a critique of that [[dialectical materialism]], that I in my earliest youth took to my heart and perceived to be the only acceptable principle for thought.'' (Asger Jorn)

=== ''Signes gravés sur les églises de l'Eure et du Calvados'' (1964) ===
Jorn had noticed some graffiti scratched into the porch at the church in [[Damville]] during a visit in 1946. Having noticed similar scratchings in [[Scandinavia]] at the cathedrals in [[Ribe]], [[Lund]], and [[Trondheim]], Jorn decided to study the phenomenon. He was able to make a trip to Normandy in 1961 with Franceschi. They were able to record a number of such markings in [[Eure]] and [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], but not elsewhere. The results of the study were published as a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{no selflink|Asger Jorn}}, [[Peter Vilhelm Glob]], [[Gutorm Gjessing]], and Michel de Boüard, with photographs by Gérard Franceschi (1964).

It was a part of a political movement originating in the 1940s outside [[India]] with the purpose of allying with the [[Axis powers]] to free India from [[British Raj|British Rule]]. It was established by Indian nationalists-in-exile during the latter part of the [[Second World War]] in Singapore with monetary, military and political assistance from [[Imperial Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toye|first=Hugh|title=The Springing Tiger: A Study of the Indian National Army and of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose|date=1959|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=978-8184243925|page=187|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_ACwkShmNzUC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=Provisional+Government+of+Free+India#v=onepage&amp;q=Provisional%20Government%20of%20Free%20India&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded on 21 October 1943, the government was inspired by the concepts of [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] who was also the leader of the government and the [[Head of State]] of this Provisional Indian Government-in-exile. The government proclaimed authority over Indian civilian and military personnel in Southeast Asian British colonial territory and prospective authority over Indian territory to fall to the Japanese forces and the [[Indian National Army]] during the [[Burma Campaign#First Arakan campaign|Japanese thrust towards India]] during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Borra R., ''Op. Cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Azad Hind had its own currency, court and civil code, and in the eyes of some Indians its existence gave a greater legitimacy to the independence struggle against the British.&lt;ref name=Singh102&gt;The INA trial and the Raj.

However, while it possessed all the nominal requisites of a legitimate government, it lacked large and definite areas of sovereign territory until Japan gave it nominal authority of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] in 1943 and the occupation of parts of [[Manipur]] and [[Nagaland]]. Japanese officials made all the decisions, and throughout its existence it was entirely dependent on Japanese support.&lt;ref&gt;C. Bayly &amp; T. Harper ''Forgotten Armies. The Fall of British Asia 1941–45'' (London: Allen Lane) 2004 pp323-327&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the formation of the [[government-in-exile]], Azad Hind declared war against the Anglo-American allied forces on the Indo-Burma Front.&lt;ref&gt;Pandit, HN. ''Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose'', Sterling Publishers, New Delhi, 1988, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; Its army, the "Azad Hind Fauj" ([[Indian National Army]] or the ''INA''), went into action against the [[British Indian Army]] and the allied forces as part of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in the Imphal-Kohima sector. The INA had its first major engagement at the [[Battle of Imphal]] where, under the command of the [[Fifteenth Army (Japan)|Japanese Fifteenth Army]], it breached the British defences in Kohima, reaching the salient of [[Moirang]] before suffering a catastrophic defeat as the Allied forces held, and Allied air dominance and compromised supply lines forced both the Japanese and the INA to retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Das S.

Special Edition. {{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/Netaji/enlisting3.htm |title=Hindustan Times - Archive News |accessdate=2007-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930040644/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/Netaji/enlisting3.htm |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy }}.

The existence of Azad Hind was essentially coterminous with the existence of the Indian National Army. While the government itself continued until the civil administration of the Andaman Islands was returned to the jurisdiction of the [[British India|British]] towards the end of the war, the limited power of Azad Hind was effectively ended with the surrender of the last major contingent of INA troops in [[Rangoon]]. The [[Death of Subhas Chandra Bose|death]] of Bose is seen as the end of the entire Azad Hind Movement.

Some historians contend that the Azad Hind was a free and independent government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chandra Sarkar|first=Subodh|authorlink=|title=Notable Indian trials
|publisher=M.C. Sarkar; Original from: [[University of Michigan Press]]|year=2008|page=1962|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of Azad Hind is, however, open to judgment. After the war, the Raj observed with alarm the transformation of the perception of Azad Hind from traitors and collaborators to "the greatest among the patriots".&lt;ref&gt;Edwardes, Michael, ''The Last Years of British India, Cleveland, World Pub. Co.,1964, p. 93''.&lt;blockquote&gt; The Government of India had hoped, by prosecuting members of the INA, to reinforce the morale of the Indian army. It succeeded only in creating unease, in making the soldiers feel slightly ashamed that they themselves had supported the British. If Bose and his men had been on the right side – and all India now confirmed that they were – then Indians in the Indian army must have been on the wrong side. It slowly dawned upon the Government of India that the backbone of the British rule, the Indian army, might now no longer be trustworthy. The ghost of Subhas Bose, like Hamlet’s father, walked the battlements of the Red Fort (where the INA soldiers were being tried), and his suddenly amplified figure overawed the conference that was to lead to independence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica''. [http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9311795 Indian National army]. After returning to India the veterans of the INA posed a difficult problem for the British government. The British feared that a public trial for treason on the part of the INA members might embolden anti-British sentiment and erupt into widespread protest and violence. URL Accessed on 19 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the tide of militant nationalism that swept through India and the resentment and revolts it inspired, it is arguable that its overarching aim, to foster public resentment and revolts within the Indian forces of the British Indian Army to overthrow the [[British Raj|Raj]], was ultimately successful.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica''.

==Establishment==

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1985-130-30, Berlin, Gründung Zentrale "Freies Indien".jpg|thumb|250px|right| National celebration at the founding of the Provisional National Indian government at the Free India Center, Berlin, with [[Secretary of State#Germany|Secretary of State]] [[Wilhelm Keppler]] speaking, on 16 November 1943]]
The direct origins of Azad Hind can be linked to two conferences of Indian expatriates from across Southeast Asia, the first of which was held in Tokyo in March 1942. At this conference, convened by [[Rash Behari Bose]], an Indian expatriate living in Japan, the [[Indian Independence League]] was established as the first move towards an independent Indian state politically aligned with the [[Empire of Japan]]. Rash also moved to create a sort of independence army that would assist in driving the British from India – this force would later become the Indian National Army. The second conference, held later that year in Bangkok, invited [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] to participate in the leadership of the League. Bose was living in Germany at the time and made the trip to Japan via submarine.

Rash Behari Bose, who was already ageing by the time the League was founded, struggled to keep the League organised and failed to secure resources for the establishment of the Indian National Army. He was replaced as president of the Indian Independence League by Subhas Chandra Bose; there is some controversy as to whether he stepped down of his own volition or by pressure from the Japanese who needed a more energetic and focused presence leading the Indian nationalists. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Bose arrived in Tokyo on 13 June 1943, and declared his intent to make an assault against the eastern provinces of India in an attempt to oust the British from control of the subcontinent. Bose arrived in Singapore on 2 July, and in October 1943 formally announced the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India. In defining the tasks of this new political establishment, Subhas declared: "It will be the task of the Provisional Government to launch and conduct the struggle that will bring about the expulsion of the British and their allies from the soil of India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aicc.org.in/indian_national_army.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423194421/http://www.aicc.org.in/indian_national_army.php |archivedate=23 April 2009 |title=Indian National Army}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bose, taking formal command of the demoralised and undermanned Indian National Army from Rash Bose, turned it into a professional army with the help of the Japanese. He recruited Indian civilians living in Japanese-occupied territories of South-east Asia, and incorporated vast numbers of Indian POWs from British forces in Singapore, Malaya and Hong Kong to man the brigades of the INA.

==Ministers==
The Provisional Government of Free India consisted of a Cabinet headed by Subhas Chandra Bose as the ''Head of the State, The Prime Minister and the Minister for War and Foreign Affairs''.

Captain Doctor [[Lakshmi Swaminadhan]] (later married as [[Lakshmi Sahgal]]) was the ''Minister in Charge of Women's Organization''. She held this position over and above her command of the ''Rani Jhansi Regiment'', a brigade of women soldiers fighting for the Indian National Army. For a regular Asian army, this women's regiment was quite visionary; it was the first of its kind established on the continent. Dr. Lakshmi was one of the most popular and prosperous gynaecologists in [[Singapore]] before she gave up her practice to lead the troops of the [[Rani of Jhansi Regiment]].

Other public administration ministers of the Provisional Government of Free India included:
*Mr. [[S. A. Ayer]] - the Minister of Broadcasting and Publicity
*Lt. Col. A. C. Chatterji - the Minister of Finance

The Indian National Army was represented by Armed Forces ministers, including:
*Lt. Col. Aziz Ahmed &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.netajiliveson.org/pgiinexile.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224022642/http://www.netajiliveson.org/pgiinexile.htm |archive-date=24 February 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://a2o.nas.sg/a2o/public/html/online_exhibit/indian_national_army/provi.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102012053/http://a2o.nas.sg/a2o/public/html/online_exhibit/indian_national_army/provi.htm |archive-date=2 November 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Lt. Col. J. K. Bhonsle
*Lt. Colonel Guizara Singh
*Lt. Col. [[M.Z. Kiani]]
*Lt. Col. [[A. D. Loganathan]]
*Lt. Col. Ehsan Qadir
*Lt. Col. [[Shah Nawaz Khan (general)|Shahnawaz Khan]]

The Provisional Government was also constituted and administered by a number of Secretaries and Advisors to Subhas Chandra Bose, including:
*A.N. Sahay - Secretary
*[[Karim Ghani]]
*Debnath Das
*D.M. Khan
*A. Yellapa
*[[J. Thivy]]
*Sardar Ishar Singh Narula
*A. N. Sarkar - the government's official Legal Advisor

All of these Secretaries and Advisory officials held Ministerial rank in the Provisional Government. The extent of the Provisional Government's day-to-day management of affairs for Azad Hind is not entirely well-documented, so their specific functions as government officials for the state outside their positions as support ministers for Subhas Chandra Bose is not entirely certain.

==Recognition==
{{Unreferenced section|date= February 2012}}
Azad Hind was recognised as a legitimate state by only a small number of countries limited solely to Axis powers and their allies. Azad Hind had diplomatic relations with nine countries: [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Empire of Japan]], [[Italian Social Republic]], [[Independent State of Croatia]] and [[Wang Jingwei Government]], [[Thailand in World War II|Thailand]], the [[State of Burma]], [[Manchukuo]] and the [[Second Philippine Republic]]. On the declaration of its formation in occupied Singapore the [[Taoiseach|Taoiseach of Ireland]], [[Éamon de Valera]], sent a note of congratulations to Bose. [[Vichy France]], however, although being an Axis collaborator, never gave formal political recognition to Azad Hind. This government participated as an observer in the [[Greater East Asia Conference]] in November 1943. [[File:Greater East Asia Conference.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Greater East Asia Conference]] in November 1943, participants left to right: [[Ba Maw]], [[Zhang Jinghui]], [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Hideki Tojo]], [[Wan Waithayakon]], [[José P. Laurel]], [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] ]]

==Government administration and World War II==
{{Main|Indian National Army|India during World War II|Invasion and Occupation of the Andaman Islands during World War II}}
The same night that Bose declared the existence of Azad Hind, the government took action to declare war against the United States and Britain. The government consisted of a Cabinet ministry acting as an advisory board to Subhas Bose, who was given the title "Netaji" (translating roughly to "leader"{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}) and was no doubt the dominant figure in the Provisional Government. He exercised virtual authoritarian control over the government{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} and the army.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} With regards to the government's first issuances of war declarations, the "Cabinet had not been unanimous about the inclusion of the U.S.A. Bose had shown impatience and displeasure – there was never any question then or later of his absolute authority: the Cabinet had no responsibility and could only tender advice..."{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

At the end of October 1943, Bose flew to Tokyo to participate in the Greater East Asia Conference as an observer to Japan's [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]; it could not function as a delegate because India had technically fallen outside the jurisdiction of Japan's definition of "Greater East Asia", but Bose gave speeches in opposition to Western colonialism and imperialism at the conference. By the end of the conference, Azad Hind had been given a limited form of governmental jurisdiction over the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], which had been captured by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] early on in the war.[[File:Azadhindpostage.jpg|thumb|right|[[Azad Hind Stamps|Unreleased postage stamps]] of the Azad Hind Government.]]

Once under the jurisdiction of Azad Hind, the islands formed the government's first claims to territory. The islands themselves were renamed "Shaheed" and "Swaraj", meaning "martyr" and "self-rule" respectively. Bose placed the islands under the governorship of [[Lt Col A. D Loganathan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yorozubp.com/netaji/75birthday/dhillon.htm |title=The Last Straw That Broke the Back of the British Empire |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030605082123/http://www.yorozubp.com/netaji/75birthday/dhillon.htm |archivedate=5 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had limited involvement with the official governorship of the territory, instead involving himself in plans to expand the [[Indian National Army]], ensure adequate men and materiel, and formulate its course of actions and the administrations and relations of the Indian population in south east Asia and determining Japanese designs in India and his provisional government. In theory the government itself had the power to levy taxes on the local populace, and to make and enforce laws: in practice they were enforced by the police force under Japanese control.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Indians were willing to pay these taxes at first, but became less inclined to do so towards the end of the war when the Provisional Government enacted legislation for higher war-time taxes to fund the INA. During his interrogation after the war Loganathan admitted that he had only had full control over the islands' vestigial education department, as the Japanese had retained full control over the police force, and in protest he had refused to accept responsibility for any other areas of Government. He was powerless to prevent the Homfreyganj massacre of 30 January 1944, where forty-four Indian civilians were shot by the Japanese on suspicion of spying. Many of them were members of the [[Indian Independence League]], whose leader in [[Port Blair]], Dr. Diwan Singh, had already been tortured to death in the [[Cellular Jail]] after doing his best to protect the islanders from Japanese atrocities during the first two years of the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Jayant Dasgupta ''Japanese in Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands. Red Sun over Black Water'' (Delhi: Manas Publications) 2002 pp67, 87, 91–5; L.P. Mathur ''Kala Pani. History of the Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands with a study of India's Freedom Struggle'' (Delhi: Eastern Book Corporation) 1985 pp249-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Azad Hind's military forces in the form of the INA saw some successes against the British, and moved with the Japanese army to lay siege to the town of [[Imphal]] in eastern India. Plans to march towards [[Delhi]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} gaining support and fresh recruits along the way, stalled both with the onset of monsoon season and the failure to capture Imphal. British [[bombing]] seriously reduced morale, and the Japanese along with the INA forces began their withdrawal from India.

In addition to these setbacks, the INA was faced with a formidable challenge when the troops were left to defend [[Rangoon]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} without the assistance of the Japanese in the winter of 1944–1945. Loganathan was relocated from the Andaman Islands to act as field commander. With the INA garrison about 6,000 strong, he manned the Burmese capital in the absence of any other police force or troops during the period between the departure of the Japanese and the arrival of the British. He was successful in maintaining law and order to the extent that there was not a single reported case of [[dacoit]]y or of looting during the period from 24 April to 4 May 1945.

==Indian areas under the administration of the Provisional Government==
Almost all of the territory of the Provisional Government lay in the Andaman Islands, although the Provisional Government was allowed some authority over Indian enclaves in Japanese-occupied territories. Provisional Government civil authority was never enacted in areas occupied by the INA; instead, Japanese military authority prevailed and responsibility for administration of occupied areas of India was shared between the Japanese and the Indian forces.

==The defeat of the INA and the collapse of the Provisional Government==
Left to defend{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Rangoon  from the British advance without support from the Japanese, the INA was soundly defeated. Bose was suggested to leave Burma to continue his struggle for Indian independence and returned to Singapore before the fall of Rangoon; the government Azad Hind had established on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands collapsed when the island garrisons of Japanese and Indian troops were defeated by British troops and the islands themselves retaken. Allegedly Bose himself was killed in a plane crash departing from [[Taiwan]] attempting to escape to [[Russia]]. The Provisional Government of Free India ceased to exist with the deaths of the Axis, the INA, and Bose in 1945.

The troops who manned the brigades of the Indian National Army were taken as [[prisoners of war]] by the British. A number of these prisoners were brought to India and tried by British courts for treason, including a number of high-ranking officers such as [[Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon|Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon]]. The defence of these individuals from [[prosecution]] by the British became a central point of contention between the [[British Raj]] and the [[Indian Independence Movement]] in the post-war years.

==Relations with Japan and view of Azad Hind as Axis collaborator==
[[File:Bose Gandhi 1938.jpg|thumb|left|Bose with Gandhi in 1938]]
Since [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] pragmatically aligned with Japan to liberate India, British propaganda tried to portray him as a controversial figure for his official stance against [[imperialism]] which would run in opposition against what British propaganda portrayed as Japanese imperialism in Asia during World War II. Bose himself opposed all manner of colonial practices, but saw Britain as [[hypocritical]] in "fighting a war for democracy" but refusing to extend the same respect for democracy and equal rights to their colonial subjects in India. Bose opposed [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|British racial policy]] and declared [[Greater East Asia Conference#Joint Declaration|working for the abolition of racial discrimination]] with [[Burma|Burmese]], Japanese and other Asians. British propaganda accused him of fascism, citing his control over the Provisional Government as strict as evidence of this; and further tried to portray him wanting to establish a [[totalitarian]] state in India with the blessings of the Axis powers. It is inaccurate to term Bose solely as a fascist. But he believed that parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for India immediately after independence, and that a centrally organised, self-sufficient, semi-socialist India under the firm control of a single party was the best course for Indian government. Some of his ideas would help shape Indian governmental policy in the aftermath of the country's independence from Britain.

The fact that Azad Hind was aligned politically with Japan may have little to do with explicit agreement and support for Japanese policy in Asia, and more with what Bose saw as a [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] approach to Indian independence. Disillusioned with [[Gandhi]]'s philosophies of non-violence, Bose was clearly of the camp that supported exploiting British weakness to gain Indian independence. Throughout the existence of Azad Hind, Bose sought to distance himself from Japanese collaboration and become more self-sufficient, but found this difficult since the existence of Azad Hind as a governmental entity had only come about with the support of the Japanese, on whom the government and army of Azad Hind were entirely dependent. Bose, however, remains a hero in present-day India and is remembered as a man who fought fiercely for Indian independence. [http://sarvadharma.org/Museum/heroes/subbose.htm]

Although Japanese troops saw much of the combat in India against the British, the INA was certainly by itself an effective combat force,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} having faced British and allied troops and making their mark in the [[Battle of Imphal]]. On 18 April 1944 the suicide squads led by Col. Shaukat Malik broke through the British defence and captured [[Moirang]] in Manipur. The Azad Hind administration took control of this independent Indian territory.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hindustan Times'' {{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/Netaji/enlisting9.htm |title=Hindustan Times - Archive News |accessdate=2007-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014458/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/Netaji/enlisting9.htm |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Moirang, the advancing INA breached the Kohima road, posing a threat to the British positions in both [[Silchar]] and [[Kohima]]. Col. Gulzara Singh's column had penetrated 250 miles into India. The Azad Brigade advanced, by outflanking the Anglo-American positions.

However, INA's most serious, and ultimately fatal, limitations were the reliance on Japanese logistics and supplies and the total air-dominance of the allies, which, along with a supply line deluged by torrential rain, frustrated the INA's and the Japanese bid to take [[Imphal]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

With the siege of Imphal failing, the Japanese began to shift priority for resource allocation from South Asia to the Pacific, where they were fighting United States troops advancing from island to island against Japanese holdings there. When it had become clear that Bose's plans to advance to Delhi from the borders of Burma would never materialise due to the defeat of the INA at [[Imphal]] and the halt of Japanese armies by British [[Air force|aerial]] and later [[naval]] superiority in the region, Japanese support for Azad Hind declined.

==Contributions to Indian independence==
The true extent to which the INA's activities influenced the decision to leave India is mirrored by the views of [[Clement Attlee]], the British prime minister at the time of India's Independence. Attlee cites several reasons, the most important of which were the INA activities of Subhas Chandra Bose, which weakened the very foundation of the British Empire in India, and the [[Royal Indian Navy Mutiny]] which made the British realise that the support of the Indian armed forces could no longer be relied upon.&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, R.C., ''Jibanera Smritideepe (Bengali)'', Calcutta, General Printers and Publishers, 1978, pp. 229–230&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ba Chúc massacre''' was carried out by the  [[Kampuchean Revolutionary Army]] (Khmer Rouge) from April 18 to April 30, 1978 in [[Ba Chúc]], [[Tri Tôn District | Tri Tôn]], [[An Giang Province]], [[Vietnam]]. Of those who had lived in Ba Chúc, 3,157 civilians were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/07/opinion/07iht-edpringle_ed3_.html "MEANWHILE : When the Khmer Rouge came to kill in Vietnam"] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Only two survived the massacre. An addition of more than 200 people were killed or injured by land mines deployed by the Khmer Rouge upon retreat.

The attack was one of the events that prompted the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea]].

A '''back-to-the-land movement''' is any of various [[agrarianism|agrarian]] movements across different historical periods. The common thread is a call for people to take up [[smallholding]] and to grow food from the land with an emphasis on a greater degree of [[self-sufficiency]], [[autonomy]], and local [[community]] than found in a prevailing industrial or postindustrial way of life. There have been a variety of motives behind such movements, such as [[reform movement|social reform]], [[land reform]], and civilian [[war effort]]s. Groups involved have included political reformers, [[counterculture]] hippies, and religious [[separatism|separatist]]s.

The concept was popularized in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century by activist [[Bolton Hall (activist)|Bolton Hall]], who set up [[urban agriculture|vacant lot farming]] in New York City and wrote many books on the subject.&lt;ref name=NYT19381211&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1938/12/11/99574731.pdf "Bolton Hall, 84, Single Taxer, Dies," ''New York Times,'' December 11, 1938] ''Access to this link requires a subscription to the newspaper or its website.''&lt;/ref&gt; The practice, however, was strong in Europe even before that time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/08/24/101893174.pdf "Helping the Poor Back to the Land," ''New York Times,'' August 24, 1909] ''Access to this link requires a subscription to the newspaper or its website.''&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], when Great Britain faced a blockade by Nazi U-boats, a [[victory garden|"Dig for Victory"]] campaign urged civilians to fight food shortages by growing vegetables on any available patch of land.  In the USA between the mid-1960s and mid-1970s there was a revived back-to-the-land movement, with substantial numbers migrating from cities to rural areas.

The back-to-the-land movement has ideological links to [[distributism]], a 1920s and 1930s attempt [[syncretic politics|to find a "Third Way" between capitalism and socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Joseph Nuttgens, London Review of Books, 13 May 2010 p 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== The movement throughout history ==
The American social commentator and poet [[Gary Snyder]] has related that there have been back-to-the-land population movements throughout the centuries, and throughout the world, largely due to the occurrence of severe urban problems and people's felt need to live a better life, often simply to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Gary (Sept/Oct 1984) "Choosing Your Place-and Taking a Stand" interview with G.S., ''The Mother Earth News''&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian and philosopher of urbanism [[Jane Jacobs]] remarked in an interview with [[Stewart Brand]] that with the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|Fall of Rome]] city dwellers re-inhabited the rural areas of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brand|first1=Stewart|title=Vital Cities: An Interview with Jane Jacobs|url=http://www.wholeearth.com/issue/1340/article/69/vital.cities.an.interview.with.jane.jacobs|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From another point of departure, [[Yi-Fu Tuan]] takes a view that such trends have often been privileged and motivated by sentiment. "Awareness of the past is an important element in the love of place," he writes, in his 1974 book ''Topophilia''. Tuan writes that an appreciation of nature springs from wealth, privilege, and the antithetical values of cities. He argues that literature about land (and, subsequently, about going back to the land) is largely sentimental; "little," he writes, "is known about the farmer's attitudes to nature..." Tuan finds historical instances of the desire of the civilized to escape civilization in the [[Hellenistic]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Augustus|Augustan]], and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] eras, and, from one of the earliest recorded myths, the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.

==The movement in North America ==
Regarding North America, many individuals and households have moved from urban or suburban circumstances to rural ones at different times; for instance, the economic theorist and land-based American experimenter [[Ralph Borsodi]] (author of ''Flight from the City'') is said to have influenced thousands of urban-living people to try a modern [[homesteading]] life during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newschoolofliving.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/ralph-borsodi-and-school-of-living.html|title=Ralph Borsodi and The School of Living|website=newschoolofliving.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Deal]] town of [[Arthurdale, West Virginia]], however, is usually called a failure.

There was again a fair degree of interest in moving to rural land after World War II. In 1947, [[Betty MacDonald]] published what became a popular book, ''[[The Egg and I]]'', telling her story of marrying and then moving to a small [[farm]] on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state. This story was the basis of a successful comedy film starring [[Claudette Colbert]] and [[Fred MacMurray]].

The Canadian writer [[Farley Mowat]] says that many returned veterans after [[World War II]] sought a meaningful life far from the ignobility of modern warfare, regarding his own experience as typical of the pattern. In [[Canada]], those who sought a life completely outside of the cities, suburbs, and towns frequently moved into semi-wilderness environs.

But what made the later phenomenon of the 1960s and 1970s especially significant was that the rural-relocation trend was sizable enough that it was identified in the American demographic statistics.

Roots of this movement can perhaps be traced to some of [[Bradford Angier]]'s books, such as ''At Home in the Woods'' (1951) and ''We Like it Wild'' (1963), [[Louise Dickinson Rich]]'s ''We Took to the Woods'' (1942) and subsequent books, or perhaps even more compellingly to the 1954 publication of [[Helen Nearing|Helen]] and [[Scott Nearing]]'s book, ''Living the Good Life''. This book chronicles the Nearings' move to an older house in a [[rural]] area of [[Vermont]] and their [[self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]] and [[simple living|simple lifestyle]]. In their initial move, the Nearings were driven by the circumstances of the Great Depression and influenced by earlier writers, particularly [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Their book was published six years after ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'', by the ecologist and environmental activist [[Aldo Leopold]], was published, in 1948. Influences aside, the Nearings had planned and worked hard, developing their homestead and life according to a twelve-point plan they had drafted.

The narrative of Phil Cousineau's documentary film ''Ecological Design: Inventing the Future'' asserts that in the decades after [[World War II]], "The world was forced to confront the dark shadow of science and industry... There was a clarion call for a return to a life of human scale." By the late 1960s, many people had recognized that, leaving their city or suburban lives, they completely lacked any familiarity with such basics of life as food sources (for instance, what a potato plant looks like, or the act of milking a cow) — and they felt out of touch with nature, in general. While the back-to-the-land movement was not strictly part of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], the two movements had some overlap in participation.

Many people were attracted to getting more in touch with the basics just mentioned, but the movement could also have been fueled by the negatives of modern life: rampant [[consumerism]], the failings of government and society, including the [[Vietnam War]], and a perceived general urban deterioration, including a growing public concern about air and water [[pollution]]. Events such as the [[Watergate scandal]] and the 1973 [[energy crisis]] contributed to these views. Some people rejected the struggle and boredom of "moving up the company ladder." Paralleling the desire for reconnection with nature was a desire to reconnect with physical work. Farmer and author Gene Logsdon expressed the aim aptly as: "the kind of independence that defines success in terms of how much food, clothing, shelter, and contentment I could produce for myself rather than how much I could ''buy''."&lt;ref&gt;Logsdon, Gene 1995 ''The Contrary Farmer''. White River Junction, Vt:Chelsea Green&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a segment within the movement who already had a familiarity with rural life and farming, who already had skills, and who wanted land of their own on which they could demonstrate that [[organic farming]] could be made practical and economically successful.

Besides the Nearings and other authors writing later along similar lines, another influence from the world of American publishing was the unprecedented, vigorous, and intelligent ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]s''. [[Stewart Brand]] and a circle of friends and family began the effort in 1968, because Brand believed that there was a groundswell of biologists, designers, engineers, sociologists, organic farmers, and social experimenters who wished to transform civilization along lines that might be called "[[sustainable]]". Brand and cohorts created a catalog of "tools" - defined broadly to include useful books, design aids, maps, gardening implements, carpentry and masonry tools, metalworking equipment, and a great deal more.

Another important publication was ''[[The Mother Earth News]]'', a periodical (originally on newsprint) that was founded a couple years after the ''Catalog''. Ultimately gaining a large circulation, the magazine was focused on how-to articles, personal stories of successful and budding homesteaders, interviews with key thinkers, and the like. The magazine stated its philosophy was based on returning to people a greater measure of control of their own lives.

Many of the North American back-to-the-landers of the 1960s and 1970s made use of the ''Mother Earth News'', the ''Whole Earth Catalogs'' and derivative publications. But as time went on, the movement itself drew more people into it, more or less independently of impetus from the publishing world.

The '''Baltimore Urban Debate League''' ('''BUDL''', pronounced "boodle"), is an American, [[non profit organization|non profit]], [[urban debate league]] that aims to educate and [[mentorship|mentor]] [[inner city]] [[Middle school#Canada and the United States|middle school]] and [[Secondary education in the United States|high school]] students in the [[Baltimore, Maryland]] area.

The main focus of the organization is to teach students [[policy debate]]. Currently the league serves approximately 51 schools in Baltimore, and has been nationally recognized by several organizations for spreading debate in the city's public schools and increasing awareness nationwide about urban debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soros.org/initiatives/youth/news/case_20030605 |title="Making Their Case" Highlights Growth and Impact of Urban Debate Movement |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last= |first= |authorlink= |date= June 2003 |format= |work= |publisher=Open Society Institute |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610004440/http://www.soros.org/initiatives/youth/news/case_20030605 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=2007-06-10 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbandebate.org/newsStory.py?id=36 |title=60 Minutes Tells the Urban Debate League Story |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last= |first= |authorlink= |date= June 2003 |format= |work= |publisher=National Association of Urban Debate Leagues |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804192550/http://urbandebate.org/newsStory.py?id=36 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=2007-08-04 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The league was started in 1999 by a grant from the [[Fund for Educational Excellence]] in collaboration with [[Open Society Institute|George Soros' Open Society Institute]]. Only 8 high schools and 90 students participated in the first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soros.org/initiatives/baltimore/focus_areas/f_urban_debate |title=Baltimore Urban Debate League |accessdate=2007-07-23 |last= |first=|publisher=Open Society Institute |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608040115/http://www.soros.org/initiatives/baltimore/focus_areas/f_urban_debate &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=2007-06-08 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassie, Ron.

Also, in the 2005-2006 season, BUDL successfully incorporated the high school debate model into several middle schools around the city. Middle school students are able to take advantage of many of the opportunities afforded to high school debaters, including the opportunity to go to their very own debate camp called "B'More Debate" in order to improve their debate skills and to encourage continued participation in BUDL. The middle school camp happens during the summer months and has a very similar format to BUDL's high school camp, and is held at [[Towson University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budl.org/news_article?id=65 |title=BUDL Launches Middle School Program |accessdate=2007-08-05 |last=Ellis |first=Andy |publisher=Baltimore Urban Debate League |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012219/http://www.budl.org/news_article?id=65 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |quote= |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate format==
===High school===
{{Policy debate}}

At the high school level, students debate according to [[policy debate]] guidelines. Each season one resolution is established by the [[National Forensic League]] and [[National Catholic Forensic League]]. There are three divisions on the high school level: novice, junior varsity (JV), and varsity.&lt;ref name="BUDLintro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budl.org/about |title=Introduction to BUDL |accessdate=2007-08-02 |last= |first= |authorlink= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Baltimore Urban Debate League |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810011302/http://www.budl.org/about &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=2007-08-10 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three divisions have the same timing conventions for debate rounds, the only exception being preparation time (novice get ten minutes, JV and varsity get five minutes). Also, the JV and varsity divisions may use any affirmative case they want throughout the competitive year, and so could the novice division at once point. In the 2003-2004 season however, new rules mandated that the novice division could only use one affirmative case per season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budl.org/teachersh_article?id=70 |title=Argument Restrictions in Novice Division |accessdate=2007-08-02 |last= |first= |authorlink= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Baltimore Urban Debate League |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613213902/http://www.budl.org/teachersh_article?id=70 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=2007-06-13 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle school===
BUDL uses its own format for the middle school level since there is no national organization that governs or regulates middle school debate competition. They still have the same number of divisions, and follow the basic format of policy debate, but instead of one resolution every year, one topic is chosen every month. The league narrows it down to a pool of topics, and all of the member schools vote on which one they would like to debate. The speech and cross examination times are also slightly altered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://budl.org/library/MS_Students/2006-2007/Iraq%20topic/GUIDE%20TO%20MIDDLE%20SCHOOL%20DEBATE.doc|title=The Middle School Guide to Debate|accessdate=2007-08-02|last=Ellis|first=Andy|authorlink=|date=|year=|month=|format=|work=|publisher=Baltimore Urban Debate League|pages=|language=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092740/http://budl.org/library/MS_Students/2006-2007/Iraq%20topic/GUIDE%20TO%20MIDDLE%20SCHOOL%20DEBATE.doc|archivedate=2007-09-29|quote=|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since BUDL has one of only a few middle school leagues in the country, its middle school debaters are only able to debate other middle schools around the city, until they reach the high school level.

==Member schools==
All high/middle schools that compete in year-round tournaments are a part of the [[Baltimore City Public School System]]. As a member school of BUDL, each team can participate in year-round tournaments sanctioned by the league and the high school students can compete in tourneys with the Baltimore Catholic Forensic League.&lt;ref name = "BUDLintro"/&gt; No school has to pay dues to be a part of the league and it covers the cost of BCFL dues so that debaters may participate in their tournaments. The league also pays for travel to out-of-state tournaments along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. During the summer, BUDL pays for the travel of groups of debaters to go to [[debate camp]] as well. At least once a year, BUDL holds inter-league competition with the BCFL and its schools in one big tournament.

BUDL also has a [[National Forensic League]] chair, headed by debate coach Rosemary Steck,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfl.net/About.htm |title=About the BCFL |accessdate=2007-08-02 |last= |first= |authorlink= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Baltimore Catholic Forensic League |pages= |language= |quote= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070708183042/http://www.bcfl.net/About.htm| archivedate= 8 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that BUDL debaters may participate in qualifying tournaments to compete in national tournaments. At the end of each year, BUDL awards season trophies, medals, and certificates for the progress teams and individuals have made on their particular squad.

=== League champions ===

[[Image:BUDLTrophies1.jpg|thumb|Some trophies and medallions at the annual awards banquet.]]

The year's champion is decided by how many cumulative wins each school accumulates from each individual team over the season in BUDL tournaments, not including out-of-state or BCFL tournaments.  The winners are announced at the league's annual banquet held in May.

Walbrook High School was the first high school in BUDL history to hold "top school" for an entire debate season (2002–2003). Baltimore City College became the second school to do so and has held the title consecutively for four years.

==Programs==
===Debate camps===
BUDL offers two separate debate camps that operate on different dates in the summer months. Since 2000, BUDL offered "B'More Debate", formerly called the ''Towson International Debate Institute'' (TIDI), which is primarily for high school students. Since 2006, it has created a middle school debate camp of the same name which has a very similar format to the high school camp.

B'More Debate was initially offered only to students in BUDL, but throughout the years has expanded to other students around the country. The camp is held during the summer months and lasts two weeks. The middle school camp is held after the high school camp and is a week long.

===Countdown to College===
Since 2002, BUDL has offered a college and [[SAT]] preparatory program called Countdown to College (C2C). The program is a coordination of league staff, Mother Seton Academy, and St. Ignatius Loyola Academy. The program provides free SAT workshops, college labs, college tours, and invites speakers to come talk to juniors and graduating seniors out of BUDL. C2C operates in the fall, spring, and summer, and thus far has been a huge success with college matriculation in to most 4-year universities in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndmva.org/Service_Sites/Direct_Service/Site%20Descriptions/Baltimore-BUDL.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Baltimore Urban Debate League |accessdate=2007-08-26 |last= |first= |authorlink= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=Notre Dame Mission Volunteers-AmeriCorps |pages= |language= |quote= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105259/http://www.ndmva.org/Service_Sites/Direct_Service/Site%20Descriptions/Baltimore-BUDL.pdf| archivedate= 28 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==
In 2001, three students that had competed in BUDL were able to, because of their achievements in the League, go to [[Russia]] to compete in the seventh International Education Association's Summer Debate Camp.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Zenitha, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-79135123.html "Baltimore students head to Russia for international debate contest"], [[Baltimore Afro-American]], August 3, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

BUDL received national media coverage on the news magazine ''[[60 Minutes]]''. The segment featured debaters from [[Walbrook High School]] and their coach Angelo Brooks. The students talked about how debate had changed their lives and inspired them to go to get better grades in school and go to college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/06/05/60minutes/main557188.shtml |title=Making Their Case, Debate Makes A Comeback At Inner-City Schools |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last= |first= |authorlink= |date= June 2003 |work= |publisher=CBS News |pages= |language= |quote= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070625124308/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/06/05/60minutes/main557188.shtml| archivedate= 25 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2006-2007 season, of the seniors who debated, 99 percent graduated on time. Of the 99 percent who graduated on time, 88 percent were admitted to college. The reading scores of all students improved over the school year, but debate students improved by 25 percent more than non-debaters. The results from debate students also generally improved regardless of how well - or poorly - they were doing in school before they began debating. BUDL students also earned over $100,000 in college scholarships in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boarddocs.com/mabe/bcpss/Board.nsf/b6d9f0d1f8285b2c85256e7400431d46/7aa1dc5dd87a171c8525730f005326af?OpenDocument |title=BUDL Board Meeting |accessdate=2007-08-02 |last= |first= |authorlink= |date= July 2007 |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019092815/http://www.boarddocs.com/mabe/bcpss/Board.nsf/b6d9f0d1f8285b2c85256e7400431d46/7aa1dc5dd87a171c8525730f005326af?OpenDocument|archivedate=2007-10-19|dead-url=yes |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wkcd.org/archives/featurestories/budl.html |title=Baltimore's Urban Debaters Prove the Word is Mightier than the Sword |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last= |first= |authorlink= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=WhatKidsCanDo.org |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022010043/http://www.wkcd.org/archives/featurestories/budl.html|archivedate=2007-10-22|dead-url=yes |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local Baltimore news outlets have covered events, speeches, and public debates held by the league. Possibly some of the most notable coverage happened during the 2004 crisis at Walbrook High. The school had recently changed the principal, due to criminal accusations against the old principal Dr. Andrey Bundley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://susanohanian.org/outrage_fetch.php?id=253 |title=125 Graduations at West Baltimore School Called Into Question by Audit |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last=Loh |first=Laura |authorlink= |date= July 2003 |format= |work= |publisher=The Baltimore Sun |pages= |language= |quote= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070806075403/http://susanohanian.org/outrage_fetch.php?id=253| archivedate= 6 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by Shirley Cathorne.

The league also has a "Public Debate Month" held in May every year. The goal at the end of the month is to have 100 public debates around the city. In February 2004 then mayor [[Martin O'Malley]] made a commemorative public debate month during their annual fundraiser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.budl.org/league_article?id=139|title = Mayor O'Malley Proclaims February "Public Debate Month"|accessdate = 2007-01-11|author = |last = |first = |date = |year = |month = |format = |publisher = Baltimore Urban Debate League|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092655/http://www.budl.org/league_article?id=139|archive-date = 2007-09-29|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2005, to commemorate its annual "Public Debate Month", the league held its first "Public Debate Tournament" at the [[amphitheater]] in Baltimore's [[Inner Harbor]].

The '''Benefits Agency''' (BA) was an [[executive agency]] of the [[United Kingdom]] [[Department of Social Security]] (subsequently the [[Department for Work and Pensions]]) which was set up in 1991 to "help create and deliver an active modern social security service, which encourages and enables independence and aims to pay the right money at the right time".&lt;ref&gt;"Resource Accounts 2000-2001".

The '''Bengal Legislative Assembly''' was the largest [[legislatures of British India|legislature in British India]], serving as the lower chamber of the legislature of Bengal (now [[Bangladesh]] and the Indian state of [[West Bengal]]). It was established under the [[Government of India Act, 1935]]. The assembly played an important role in the final decade of undivided Bengal. The Leader of the House was the [[Prime Minister of Bengal]]. The assembly's lifespan covered the anti-feudal movement of the Krishak Praja Party, the period of [[World War II]], the [[Lahore Resolution]], the [[Quit India]] movement, suggestions for a United Bengal and the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|partition of Bengal]] and [[partition of British India]].

Many notable speeches were delivered by Bengali statesmen in this assembly. The  records of the assembly's proceedings are preserved in the libraries of the [[Parliament of Bangladesh]] and the West Bengal Legislative Assembly.

==History==
The assembly was the culmination of legislative development in Bengal which started in 1861 with the [[Bengal Legislative Council]]. The Government of India Act, 1935 made the council the upper chamber, while the 250-seat legislative assembly was formed as the elected lower chamber. The act did not grant universal suffrage, instead in line with the [[Communal Award]], it created [[separate electorate]]s as the basis of electing the assembly. The first elections took place in 1937. The [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] emerged as the single largest party but refused to form a government due to its policy of boycotting legislatures. The [[Krishak Praja Party]] and [[Bengal Provincial Muslim League]], supported by several independent legislators, formed the first government. [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] became the first prime minister. Huq supported the League's Lahore Resolution in 1940, which called on the imperial government to include the eastern zone of British India in a future sovereign homeland for Muslims. The text of the resolution initially seemed to support the notion of an independent state in Bengal and Assam. The Krishak Praja Party implemented measures to curtail the influence of the landed gentry. Prime Minister Huq used both legal and administrative measures to relieve the debts of peasants and farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D.

The Social History of East Pakistan. Raushan Ara Ahmed. p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bengal, Huq secured the support of [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]], the leader of the [[Hindu Mahasabha]], and formed a second coalition government. [[Khawaja Nazimuddin|Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin]], a trusted confidante of Jinnah, became Leader of the Opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mohammad Alamgir |year=2012 |chapter=Nazimuddin, Khwaja |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Nazimuddin,_Khwaja |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |quote=On 1 December 1941 he resigned from the cabinet because of dissension between Huq and Jinnah.

In 1943, the Huq ministry fell and Nazimuddin formed a Muslim League government. Nazimuddin led conservative elements in the Bengal Provincial Muslim League. As [[World War II]] intensified and [[Imperial Japan]] attacked Bengal from Burma, the provincial government grappled with the [[Bengal famine of 1943]]. [[Hindu]]-[[Muslim]] relations continued to deteriorate, particularly during the Congress's [[Quit India movement]]. The next general election was delayed for two years. The Nazimuddin ministry became unpopular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=The Sole Spokesman: Jinnah, the Muslim League and the Demand for Pakistan|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45850-4|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor's rule was imposed between March 1945 and April 1946. Factional infighting within the Bengal Provincial Muslim League displaced the Nazimuddin faction; and the centre-left [[H. S. Suhrawardy]]-led faction took control of the provincial party.

The 1946 general election was won by the Bengal Provincial Muslim League. The League received its largest mandate in Bengal, compared to smaller mandates in other Muslim majority provinces in India. The result was interpreted as an equivocal approval of the [[Pakistan movement]]. Suhrawardy was appointed prime minister.&lt;ref name="Chatterji2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joya Chatterji|title=Bengal Divided: Hindu Communalism and Partition, 1932-1947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iDNAQcoVqoMC&amp;pg=PA230|date=6 June 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52328-8|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bashabi Fraser|title=Bengal Partition Stories: An Unclosed Chapter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zW30rV_UAskC&amp;pg=PA49|year=2008|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-1-84331-299-4|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suhrawardy's frosty relations with [[Jinnah]] affected his ambitions of achieving a [[United Bengal]], though both men wanted Calcutta to remain within an undivided Bengal.&lt;ref name="Jalal1994p265"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ayesha Jalal |author-link=Ayesha Jalal |year=1994 |title=The Sole Spokesman: Jinnah, the Muslim League and the Demand for Pakistan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D63KMRN1SJ8C&amp;pg=PA265 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=265 |isbn=978-0-521-45850-4 |quote=The Hindu Mahasabha's demand for partition ...

'What is the use of Bengal without Calcutta; they had better remain united and independent.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Noakhali riots]] and the violence of [[Direct Action Day]] contributed to the government's stand on partitioning Bengal. Despite support from [[Bengali Hindu]] leaders like [[Sarat Chandra Bose]] and the Governor of Bengal, Suhrawardy's proposals were not heeded by [[Earl Mountbatten]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ayesha Jalal |author-link=Ayesha Jalal |year=1994 |title=The Sole Spokesman: Jinnah, the Muslim League and the Demand for Pakistan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D63KMRN1SJ8C&amp;pg=PA281 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=280–281 |isbn=978-0-521-45850-4 |quote=Agreement was reached between Sarat Bose, Kiran Shankar Roy, Suhrawardy and a few other Leaguers ... although Mountbatten had persuaded London to make an exception for Bengal and allow it to become an independent Dominion, he quickly dropped his plan once Nehru had rejected the proposition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu Mahasabha's legislators in the assembly demanded the partition of Bengal.&lt;ref name="Jalal1994p265" /&gt;

===Eve of partition===
On 20 June 1947, the Bengal Legislative Assembly met to decide on the partition of Bengal. At the preliminary joint meeting, it was decided by 120 votes to 90 that the province, if it remained united, should join the "[[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan|new Constituent Assembly]]" (Pakistan). At a separate meeting of legislators from West Bengal, it was decided by 58 votes to 21 that the province should be partitioned and that West Bengal should join the "[[Constituent Assembly of India|existing Constituent Assembly]]" (India). At a separate meeting of legislators from East Bengal, it was decided by 106 votes to 35 that the province should not be partitioned and 107 votes to 34 that East Bengal should join the Constituent Assembly
of Pakistan in the event of partition.&lt;ref name="Mukherjee1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Soumyendra Nath Mukherjee|title=Sir William Jones: A Study in Eighteenth-century British Attitudes to India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bhd-_1RE04MC&amp;pg=PA230|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-86131-581-9|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 July 1947, the region of Sylhet in Assam voted in a [[Sylhet referendum, 1947|referendum]] to join East Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/partition1947_01.shtml |title=History - British History in depth: The Hidden Story of Partition and its Legacies |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cascade Funding''', also known as '''Financial Support for Third Parties (FSTP)''', is a [[European Commission]] mechanism to distribute public funding in order to assist  beneficiaries, such as start-ups, scale-ups, SME and/or mid-caps, in the uptake or development of digital innovation.

This funding method aims at simplifying the administrative procedures,  creating a light, SME-friendly application scheme, by allowing that some EU-funded projects may issue, in turn, open calls for further funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/other/competitive.html|title=Open Competitive calls and calls for third parties|last=|first=|authorlink=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission|date=|website=Participant Portal of the European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This  scheme is based on the model of Erasmus students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=8266|title=FoF 9: ICT Innovation for Manufacturing SMEs (I4MS). p.5|last=Sassen|first=Anne-Marie|date=16 December 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first introduced by the European Commission in [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development#Horizon 2020|Horizon 2020]], the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-ga_en.pdf|title=European Commission Decision C (2015)8621 of 4 December 2015: Part K of the General Annexes of the Work Programme for 2014-2015 for Horizon 2020"|last=|first=|authorlink=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European Commission|date=4 December 2015|website=Participant Portal of the European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

September, 2017. Page 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt;), had already piloted a similar model which is a good example of the structure and principles envisaged to be applied in the implementation scheme.

However, the procedure to provide financial support to third parties under Horizon 2020 is significantly different&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/news/faqs-h2020-calls-customised-and-low-power-computing-ict-4-and-ict-factories-future-fof-8-and|title=FAQs on H2020 calls on Customised and Low-power Computing (ICT 4) and ICT in Factories of the Future (FoF 8 and FoF 9). p.8|last=|first=|date=19 November 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; than in those experiences, in which third parties became beneficiary of the project they were selected by and entered in a contract with the European Commission. Instead, third parties receiving cascade funding under Horizon 2020 have a contract with the consortium of the EU-funded project of which they become a third party.&lt;ref&gt;Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology, European Commission. "[https://www.ffg.at/sites/default/files/downloads/page/h2020guidancenote_financialsupport2thirdparties.pdf Guidance note on financial support to third parties under H2020]". p.1&lt;/ref&gt; This means that this consortium is liable towards the European Commission for the third parties to which it provide financial support and, hence, no legal and financial validation is necessary for these third parties, which makes quicker/easier for projects to have open calls in their projects.

These open calls&lt;ref&gt;In this case, open means open to the public: any entity fulfilling each call’s rules can apply&lt;/ref&gt; from EU-funded projects are usually competitive, have a European dimension and aims at:
* selecting tech start-ups or scale-ups for acceleration or incubation purposes (usually equity free),
* supporting pilots, demonstrations and/or experiments on a specific innovative technology or framework (usually with the participation of start-ups or SME), or
* integrating more participants to the project to extend its scope or to address specific tasks.

Support offered by these open calls, usually consist in funding (typically in the range of €50,000 to €150,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/faqs/faq-8590.html|title=FAQ - Research Participant Portal|last=Commission|first=European|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) but it may also be vouchers for support services or free access and support to use testing facilities.

Most of the open calls issued during this Horizon 2020 belong to one (or more) of the following domains: Future Internet and Next Generation Internet, Smartisation, Industry 4.0 (ICT for Industry), Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics, Big Data, Photonics, Innovation throughout value chains, and the nexus between creativity and technology.

Open calls in the field of smartization and industry are linked to the creation of a pan-european network of Digital Innovation Hubs under the European Union initiatives Smart Anything Everywhere (SAE) and ICT Innovation for Manufacturing SMEs (I4MS), which are both part of the Digitising European Industry strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-innovation-hubs-projects-open-calls-smes|title=Digital Innovation Hubs projects: open calls for SMEs|last=|first=|date=|work=Digital Single Market|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cascade funding is increasingly used throughout the "Information and Communication Technologies" priority in Horizon 2020 and contributes "to knowledge transfer and exploitation, take-up of technologies, and building and scaling ecosystems in these areas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/events/cf/ict-proposers-day-2017/item-display.cfm?id=19984|title=Cascading Grants in Horizon 2020 - ICT Proposers' Day 2017|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of Venezuela has been mired with "persistent and intense presence of corruption".&lt;ref name="CATOhc"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coronel|first=Gustavo|title=Corruption, Mismanagement, and Abuse of Power in Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/development-policy-analysis/corruption-mismanagement-abuse-power-hugo-chavezs-venezuela|publisher=Cato Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, author [[Ruth Capriles]] wrote ''The history of corruption in Venezuela is the history of our democracy'' depicting the many instances of corruption in the country.&lt;ref name=VENa2z&gt;{{cite news|last=Marx|first=Gary|title=Venezuela Corruption-from A To Z|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-09-22/news/9103110977_1_venezuela-oil-wealth-visas|accessdate=29 March 2014|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=22 September 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Pro Calidad de Vida, a Venezuelan [[NGO]] claimed that some $100 billion from oil revenue has been misused in the preceding 25 years.&lt;ref name=CATOhc/&gt;

=== Simón Bolívar (1813–1830)===
During the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]] in 1813, [[Simón Bolívar]] made a decree that any corruption was punishable by death.&lt;ref name="CATOhc"/&gt; According to Beddow and Thibodeaux, [[Karl Marx]] called Bolívar a "[f]alsifier, deserter, conspirator, liar, coward, and looter" stating that Marx dismissed Bolívar as a "false liberator who merely sought to preserve the power of the old Creole nobility which he belonged".&lt;ref name=MARXbolivar&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beddow|first1=D. Méndez|last2=Thibodeaux|first2=Sam J.|title=Gangrillas : the unspoken pros and cons of legalizing drugs|date=2010|publisher=Trafford On Demand Pub|location=[U.S.]|isbn=1426948468|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Marx, after Bolívar arrived in Caracas in 1813, Bolívar's "dictatorship soon proved a military anarchy, leaving the most important affairs in the hands of favorites, who squandered the finances of the country, and then resorted to odious means in order to restore them".&lt;ref name="marx"&gt;{{cite web

During his presidency in the 1820s, Bolívar made two decrees stating corruption was "the violation of the public interest" and reinforced his edict by saying such actions were punishable by death.&lt;ref name="CATOhc"/&gt; However under Bolívar, orders were made to [[plunder]] cities, with ornaments from churches being stolen to finance his military forces.&lt;ref name="WWbol"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quiroz|first1=Alfonso W.|title=Corrupt Circles: A History of Unbound Graft in Peru|date=2008|publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson Center Press]]|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780801891281|edition=1|pages=88–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826, the Congress of Gran Colombia, which was subservient to Bolívar and had been suffering from financial issues, awarded Bolívar over 1 million [[Colombian peso|pesos]] while other officials resorted to appropriating and expropriating from the public.&lt;ref name="WWbol"/&gt; Marx stated that Bolívar's instigation of multiple armed situations in order to maintain power and his desire for "the erection of the whole of South America into one federative republic, with himself as its dictator" eventually led to his downfall.&lt;ref name="marx"/&gt;

===Antonio Guzmán Blanco and Joaquín Crespo (1870–1899)===
[[File:Panorama Le Tout-Paris (10).jpg|250px|thumb|An 1889 image of Guzmán in [[Paris, France]]. He is in the foreground, third from the left.]]
[[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]] led a fairly steady Venezuelan government that was allegedly rife with corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Judith|title=Hugo Chavez.|year=2008|publisher=Chelsea House|location=New York|isbn=978-0791092583|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sought to change Venezuela from a "backward and savage country", to a more prosperous, admiring the United States and especially France.&lt;ref name=GUNBOAT&gt;{{cite book|last=McBeth|first=Brian S.|title=Gunboats, corruption, and claims : foreign intervention in Venezuela, 1899–1908|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0313313561|page=9|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guzmán reportedly stole money from the treasury, abused his power, and, after a disagreement with a bishop, expelled any clergy who disagreed with him and seized property belonging to the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Paul H.|title=Authoritarian regimes in Latin America : dictators, despots, and tyrants|year=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md.

In 1884, Guzmán appointed [[Joaquín Crespo]] to be his successor and to serve under him. Crespo was renowned for establishing the "ring of iron" by making connections with officials before the end of his first term in 1886. He placed his allies on congressional seats to help guarantee his reelection which angered Guzmán. A power struggle then ensued between the two, leaving Venezuelan politics weakened in its wake. After a rebellion was initiated against Crespo by [[José Manuel Hernández]] in March 1898, Crespo led troops to quell the rebels, but was killed by a stray bullet in the action.&lt;ref name=GUNBOAT/&gt;

Near the end of his life, Guzmán attempted to rule Venezuela from Europe until his death in Paris on 28 July 1899, leaving a political vacuum behind due to the loss of the two leaders a little over one year.&lt;ref name=GUNBOAT/&gt;

===Cipriano Castro (1899–1908)===
[[Cipriano Castro]] served as governor of Táchira until he was overthrown and exiled to Colombia in 1892. He then amassed considerable wealth through illegal cattle trading and hired a private army with which he intended to march on Caracas. After a successful coup in 1899, his dictatorship was one of the most corrupt periods in Venezuela's history. Once in charge, Castro began plundering the treasury and modifying the constitution to convenience his administration. He had political opponents murdered or exiled, lived extravagantly and broke down diplomacy with foreign countries. He provoked numerous foreign actions, including the blockades and bombardments by British, German, and Italian naval vessels seeking to enforce the claims of their citizens against Castro's government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Paul H.|title=Authoritarian regimes in Latin America : dictators, despots, and tyrants|year=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0742537392}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States Secretary of State [[Elihu Root]] called Castro a "crazy brute", while historian [[Edwin Lieuwen]] labelled him "probably the worst of Venezuela's many dictators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Ro2fQotinsC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=cipriano+castro+elihu+root&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vacfi46Zpa&amp;sig=UuJJndzaNRAaiegW3UrH9E9323Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lpaJVYR4z6uhBLOltrgB&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cipriano%20castro%20elihu%20root&amp;f=false | title=Caribbean Follies | work=When Small Countries Crash | accessdate=June 23, 2015 |author1=MacDonald, Scott |author2=Novo, Andrew }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juan Vicente Gómez (1908–1935)===
From 1908 to 1935, the dictator [[Juan Vincente Gomez]] held power, with his acts of corruption only committed with "immediate collaborators".&lt;ref name=CATOhc/&gt; By the time he died, he was by far the richest man in the country. He did little for public education and held basic democratic principles in disdain. His allegedly ruthless crushing of opponents through his secret police earned him the reputation of a tyrant. He was also accused by opponents of trying to turn the country into a personal fiefdom.

===Marcos Pérez Jiménez (1952–1958)===
[[File:Marcos Pérez Jiménez house.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A house of Marcos Pérez Jiménez that featured fountains, a pool, an elevator, an [[observatory]] and tunnels.]]
[[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]] seized power through a coup in 1952 and declared himself provisional president until being formally elected in 1953. The government's National Security (Seguridad Nacional, secret police) was extremely repressive against critics of the regime and ruthlessly hunted down and imprisoned those who opposed the dictatorship. In 1957 during the time of reelection, voters had only the choice between voting "yes" or "no" to another term for Jiménez. Pérez Jiménez won by a large margin, though by numerous accounts the count was blatantly rigged.

On 23 January 1958, a [[1958 Venezuelan coup d'état|coup d'état]] was performed against Pérez Jiménez. Pérez Jiménez, fleeing from Miraflores Palace, went to La Carlota Airport to seek exile in the Dominican Republic. While rushing out of Venezuela, Pérez Jiménez left $2 million in a suitcase on the runway of La Carlota Airport.&lt;ref name=Carroll193&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rory|first1=Carroll|title=Comandante : Hugo Chavez's Venezuela|date=2014|publisher=New York|location=Penguin Books|isbn=0143124889|pages=193–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raúl Leoni (1964–1969)===
President [[Raúl Leoni]] spent $10 million of public funds to pave a road to his house, to build guest houses near his home, and to add air-conditioning to the local airport.&lt;ref name=VENa2z/&gt;

===Jaime Lusinchi (1984–1989)===
During the presidency from 1984–1989 of [[Jaime Lusinchi]], US$36 billion were misused by the foreign exchange program [[RECADI]].&lt;ref name=CATOhc/&gt;

===Carlos Andrés Pérez (1989–1993)===
On 20 March 1993, Attorney General [[Ramón Escovar Salom]] introduced action against President [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] for the embezzlement of {{Nowrap|250 million}} bolivars belonging to a presidential discretionary fund, or ''partida secreta''. The issue had originally been brought to public scrutiny in {{Nowrap|November 1992}} by journalist [[José Vicente Rangel]]. Pérez and his supporters claim the money was used to support the electoral process in [[Nicaragua]]. On {{Nowrap|20 May}} 1993, the [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice (Venezuela)|Supreme Court]] considered the accusation valid, and the following day the Senate voted to strip Pérez of his immunity. Pérez refused to resign, but after the maximum 90 days temporary leave available to the President under Article 188 of the 1961 constitution, the National Congress removed Pérez from office permanently on {{Nowrap|31 August}}.&lt;ref name=Kada&gt;Kada, Naoko (2003), "Impeachment as a punishment for corruption?

==Bolivarian Revolution==
[[File:Operemm-2.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Hugo Chávez wearing standard military fatigues in 2010.]]
The government in place following the [[Bolivarian Revolution]] that was initiated by [[Hugo Chávez]] has been frequently accused of corruption, abuse of the economy for personal gain, spreading "[[Bolivarian propaganda]]", buying the loyalty of the military, officials involved in drug trade, assisting terrorists, intimidation of the media, and human rights abuses of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=edited by Paul A.|title=Religious freedom in the world|year=2008|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0742562134|pages=423–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasury Targets Venezuelan Government Officials Supporting the FARC|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp1132.aspx|work=Press Release|publisher=United States Department of Treasury|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ELPAISdrugs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Meza|first=Alfredo|title=Corrupt military officials helping Venezuela drug trade flourish|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/09/26/inenglish/1380217098_793793.html|accessdate=5 March 2014|newspaper=El Pais|date=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasury Targets Hizballah in Venezuela|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/hp1036.aspx|work=Press Release|publisher=United State Department of Treasury|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= PresidentsEar&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/05/world/americas/05venezuela.html |title= In Venezuela, an American Has the President's Ear |author= Romero, Simon |date= February 4, 2011|work= The New York Times | accessdate= April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CATOcorruption&gt;{{cite web|last=Coronel|first=Gustavo|title=The Corruption of Democracy in Venezuela|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/corruption-democracy-venezuela|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela's Drug-Running Generals May Be Who Finally Ousts Maduro|url=https://news.vice.com/articles/venezuelas-drug-running-generals-may-be-who-finally-ousts-maduro|accessdate=13 April 2014|newspaper=Vice News|date=31 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413130949/https://news.vice.com/articles/venezuelas-drug-running-generals-may-be-who-finally-ousts-maduro|archivedate=13 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WorldReport&gt;{{cite web|title=World Report 2012: Venezuela|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-venezuela|publisher=The Human Rights Watch|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WJPcorruption&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela ocupa último lugar de naciones latinoamericanas analizadas|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/sociedad/Venezuela-ultimo-naciones-latinoamericanas-analizadas_0_368963219.html|accessdate=17 March 2014|newspaper=El Nacional|date=8 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318081621/http://www.el-nacional.com/sociedad/Venezuela-ultimo-naciones-latinoamericanas-analizadas_0_368963219.html|archivedate=18 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela violates human rights, OAS commission reports|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/02/24/venezuela.human.rights/|accessdate=13 April 2014|newspaper=CNN|date=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', Venezuela's corruption helped Hugo Chávez gain power and worsened under the Bolivarian government.&lt;ref name=FPrescue&gt;{{cite news|title=Democracy to the rescue?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21646272-despite-epidemic-scandal-region-making-progress-against-plague-democracy|accessdate=14 July 2015|agency=''[[Foreign Policy]]''|date=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Bolivarian government states that they have implemented strict guidelines and laws to deter corruption, enforcement of such anti-corruption laws had been weak following the centralizing powers in the government, creating less accountability for corruption and making it prevalent throughout Venezuela.&lt;ref name="B&amp;C2011"/&gt;

Chávez's successor, Nicolás Maduro was criticized for allowing corruption to remain in the government. In an article by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Venezuela's dire situation under Maduro was described as "a man-made disaster". The Bolivarian government was also seen as "a gangster state that doesn't know how to do anything other than sell drugs and steal money for itself" since Maduro's family members and close government officials were accused of being involved in illicit drug trade.&lt;ref name="WPmay2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Brien|first1=Matt|title=There has never been a country that should have been so rich but ended up this poor|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/19/there-has-never-been-a-country-that-should-have-been-so-rich-but-ended-up-this-poor/|accessdate=27 May 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hugo Chávez (1999–2013)===
In December 1998, [[Hugo Chávez]] declared three goals for the new government; "convening a constituent assembly to write a new constitution, eliminating government corruption, and fighting against social exclusion and poverty". However, during Hugo Chávez's time in power, corruption has become widespread throughout the government due to impunity towards members of the government, bribes and the lack of transparency.&lt;ref name="CATOhc"/&gt; In 2004, Hugo Chávez and his allies took over the Supreme Court, filling it with supporters of Chávez and made new measures so the government could dismiss justices from the court.&lt;ref name=HRW2012/&gt; According to the ''[[Cato Institute]]'', the [[National Electoral Council of Venezuela]] was under control of Chávez where he tried to "push a constitutional reform that would have allowed him unlimited opportunities for reelection".&lt;ref name="CATOcorruption"/&gt; Some criticisms of corruption came from Chávez's own supporters, with Chávez's initial political party, the [[Fifth Republic Movement]] (MVR), being criticized as being riddled with the same cronyism, political patronage, and corruption that Chávez alleged were characteristic of the old "Fourth Republic" political parties.&lt;ref&gt;Fuentes, F.

====Public funds====
In early 2000, Chávez's friend and co-conspirator in the [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts]] Jesus Urdaneta was appointed head of Venezuela's intelligence agency, [[DISIP]]. Urdaneta began receiving reports that Chávez's allies, Luis Miquilena, leader of the National Assembly and [[José Vicente Rangel]], Chávez's foreign minister, were keeping public funds for themselves. Urdaneta brought this to Chávez's attention, but Chávez ignored his advice saying that he needed the political experience of both men in order to establish power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rory|first1=Carroll|title=Comandante : Hugo Chavez's Venezuela|date=2014|publisher=New York|location=Penguin Books|isbn=0143124889|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

$22.5 billion of public funds have been transferred from Venezuela to foreign accounts with half of that money being unaccounted for by anyone.&lt;ref name=CATOcorruption/&gt; José Guerra, a former Central Bank executive, claims that most of that money has been used to buy political allies in countries such as [[Cuba]] and [[Bolivia]].&lt;ref name=CATOcorruption/&gt; Chávez reportedly made promises and carried out most payments of nearly $70 billion USD to foreign leaders without the consultation of the people of Venezuela and without normal legal procedures.&lt;ref name=CATOcorruption/&gt;

====Maletinazo scandal====
{{Main|Maletinazo}}
In August 2007, {{Interlanguage link multi|Guido Alejandro Antonini Wilson|es}}, a self-identified member of the entourage of Hugo Chávez, who was about to visit Argentina, arrived in Argentina on a private flight paid for by Argentine and Venezuelan state officials. Wilson was carrying $800,000 [[USD]] in cash, which the police seized on arrival. A few days later Wilson, a Venezuelan-American and a close friend of Chávez's, was a guest at a signing ceremony involving [[Cristina Kirchner]] and Chávez at the Casa Rosada. He was later arrested on money laundering and contraband charges. It was alleged that the cash was to have been delivered to the Kirchner's as a clandestine contribution to Cristina's campaign chest from President Chávez. Fernández, as a fellow leftist, was a political ally of Chávez. This was seen as a similar move that Chávez allegedly used to give payments to leftist candidates in presidential races for Bolivia and Mexico in order to back his anti-US allies.&lt;ref name="Padgett"&gt;{{cite news|last=Padgett|first=Tim|title=Chávez and the Cash-Filled Suitcase|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1838145,00.html|accessdate=28 March 2014|newspaper=TIME|date=3 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident led to a scandal and what ''Bloomberg News'' called "an international imbroglio," with the U.S. accusing five men of being secret Chávez agents whose mission was to cover up the attempt to deliver the cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2007/08/10/another-stashed-money-scandal-rocks-kirchner-s-administration|title=Another stashed money scandal rocks Kirchner's administration|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://404/|title=404.

According to the [[United States Department of Defense]]'s PRISM journal, the $800,000 in cash may have also been a payment from Iran to Cristina Kirchner. It was alleged that Chávez helped a deal for Iran to obtain nuclear technology from Argentina and to cover up the [[AMIA bombing]] information, with Venezuela also purchasing Argentine debt in the dealing. Iranian and Argentine relations improved shortly after the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levitt|first1=Matthew|title=Iranian and Hezbollah Operations in South America: Then and Now|journal=PRISM|publisher=[[National Defense University]]|date=2015|volume=5|issue=4|pages=118–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As 2016 concluded, the [[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project]] (OCCRP), an international non-governmental organization that investigates crime and corruption, gave President Maduro the ''Person of the Year Award'' that "recognizes the individual who has done the most in the world to advance organized criminal activity and corruption". The OCCRP stated that they had "chose Maduro for the global award on the strength of his corrupt and oppressive reign, so rife with mismanagement that citizens of his oil-rich nation are literally starving and begging for medicines" and that Maduro and his family steal millions of dollars from government coffers to fund patronage that maintains President Maduro's power in Venezuela. The group also explains how Maduro had overruled the legislative branch filled with opposition politicians, repressed citizen protests and had relatives involved in drug trafficking.&lt;ref name=NMoccrp&gt;{{cite web|title=Venezuelan president wins OCCRP person of the year for 2016|url=https://www.occrp.org/personoftheyear/2016/|publisher=OCCRP|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is described by a contributor to ''[[The Atlantic]]'' as the "[[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Frank Underwood]]" of Venezuela under whose watch the National Assembly of Venezuela has made a habit of ignoring constitutional hurdles entirely—at various times preventing opposition members from speaking in session, suspending their salaries, stripping particularly problematic legislators of parliamentary immunity, and, on one occasion, even presiding over the physical beating of unfriendly lawmakers while the assembly was meeting.&lt;ref name=ATLANTIC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/03/the-frank-underwood-of-venezuela/284259/|title=The Frank Underwood of Venezuela|first=Daniel|last=Lansberg-Rodríguez|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/03/27/4023508/lawsuit-filed-in-miami-accuses.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21583252-evidence-huge-rip-offs-heart-bolivarian-revolution-has-unleashed-political|title=The billion-dollar fraud|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently at least 17 formal corruption allegations lodged against Cabello in Venezuela's prosecutors office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/130820/pj-recordo-que-son-17-las-denuncias-por-corrupcion-contra-cabello|title=In Venezuela, Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely |publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His figurehead Rafael Sarría, was investigated and deported from the US in 2010.

===FARC===
Before the 2002 coup attempt, discontent within the military was created when Chávez forced them to assist the [[FARC]], a militant Colombian guerrilla group involved in illegal drug trade, with setting up camps in Venezuelan territories, providing ammunition to fight the [[Colombian government]], supplying ID cards so they could move freely through Venezuela and sending members of Bolivarian Circles to their camps to receive guerilla training.&lt;ref name=p121134NELSON/&gt; The [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] (IISS) accused Chavez's government of funding FARC's Caracas office and giving it access to intelligence services, and said that during the 2002 coup attempt that, "FARC also responded to requests from (Venezuela's intelligence service) to provide training in urban terrorism involving targeted killings and the use of explosives."

The separate note is allegedly speaking of a hostage exchange with the FARC that Chavez was supposedly helping to negotiate at that time.

The SFS believes that the documentation was provided by the Venezuelan government, and states that 70% of the people came from Iran, Lebanon and Syria "and had some connection with Hezbollah". The majority allegedly had Venezuelan passports, IDs, visas and in some cases, even Venezuelan [[birth certificate]]s. Anthony Daquin, former security advisor involved in the modernization of the Venezuelan identity system stated in the report that the Venezuelan government will "be able to issue the Venezuelan document without any problem, from the University of Computer Sciences, because they have the equipment and supplies, including polycarbonate sheets, electronic signature that goes into passports and encryption certificates, which are those that allow the chip to be read at the airports". One of the key figures of the Venezuelan government noted in the SFS report was the Lebanese born former Minister of the Interior, [[Tarek El Aissami]], who allegedly "developed a sophisticated financial network and multi-level networks as a criminal-terrorist pipeline to bring Islamic militants to Venezuela and neighboring countries, and to send illicit funds from Latin America to the Middle East". The alleged "pipeline" consists of 40 [[shell companies]] which have bank accounts in Venezuela, Panama, Curacao, St. Lucia, Miami and Lebanon. Tarek El Aissami's father Zaidan El Amin El Aissami, was the leader of a small Ba'athist party in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela, el principal nexo de Hezbollah para su ingreso a América del Norte|url=http://www.infobae.com/2014/09/10/1593759-venezuela-el-principal-nexo-hezbollah-su-ingreso-america-del-norte|accessdate=12 September 2014|agency=Infobae|date=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maria Delgado|first1=Antonio|title=Venezuela, trampolin del Hezbola|url=http://www.elnuevoherald.com/2014/09/10/1839178/venezuela-trampolin-del-hezbola.html|accessdate=12 September 2014|agency=El Nuevo Herald|date=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Vice President [[José Vicente Rangel]] who served under Hugo Chavez denounced the SFS study stating that it was a "combined campaign" by SFS and the Canadian government to attack Venezuela, though Ben Rowswell, the Canadian ambassador in Venezuela, denied the accusations by Rangel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siekierski|first1=BJ|title=In Venezuela, Canadian envoy takes to Twitter to refute conspiracy theories|url=http://www.ipolitics.ca/2014/10/21/in-venezuela-canadian-envoy-takes-to-twitter-to-refute-conspiracy-theories/|accessdate=22 October 2014|agency=iPolitics|date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Spanish journalist Emili Blasco released ''Bumerán Chávez'', a book investigating allegations from high-ranking Chavista whistleblowers. According to former Finance Minister [[Rafael Isea]], while President Nicolás Maduro was Chávez's foreign minister, Maduro was present at a 2007 meeting in Damascus with Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah that was set up by former Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]].&lt;ref name=ROTTENstate/&gt;&lt;ref name=ARUTZboomerang/&gt; Isea arrived in Damascus and a Syrian security officer escorted Isea to Maduro where he was waiting at a hotel.&lt;ref name=ARUTZboomerang/&gt; The two then met with the Hezbollah leader and Maduro promoted Venezuelan diplomat Ghazi Atef Nassereddine, an individual who supposedly raised money for Hezbollah in Latin America.&lt;ref name=ARUTZboomerang/&gt; Maduro made other negotiations with Nasrallah and allowed 300 Hezbollah members "to fundraise in Venezuela".&lt;ref name=ROTTENstate/&gt;

In February 2017, [[CNN]] reported in their article, ''Venezuelan Passports, in the Wrong Hands?'', an investigation performed focusing on the sale of Venezuelan passports to individuals in the Middle East, specifically Syria, Palestine, Iraq and Pakistan. According to Misael López Soto, a former employee at the Venezuelan embassy in Iraq who was also a lawyer and [[CICPC]] officer, the Bolivarian government would sell authentic passports to individuals from the Middle East, with the Venezuelan passport able to access 130 countries throughout the world without a visa requirement. López provided CNN documents showing how his superiors attempted to cover up the sale of passports, which were being sold from $5,000 to $15,000 per passport. López Soto fled the Venezuelan embassy in Iraq in 2015 to meet with the FBI in Spain, with a Venezuelan official who assisted him to fly out of the country being killed the same day. The investigation also found that between 2008 and 2012, [[Tareck El Aissami]] ordered for hundreds of Middle Eastern individuals to obtain illegal passports, including members of Hezbollah.&lt;ref name="CNNpassport"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diplomático venezolano denunció la entrega de documentos a terroristas {{!}} Venezuela, Terrorismo, Hezbollah – América|url=http://www.infobae.com/2015/11/24/1772058-diplomatico-venezolano-denuncio-la-entrega-documentos-terroristas/|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[Infobae]]|date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kleptocracy==
[[File:PDVSA corruption flowchart.jpg|thumb|A flowchart detailing PDVSA money laundering]]
[[InSight Crime]] states that state funds "have been pillaged on an industrial scale by the Bolivarian elite" and that "kleptocracy has certainly been one of the main factors that has brought Venezuela to the edge of economic collapse and bankruptcy".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Venezuela: A Mafia State?|last=|first=|publisher=[[InSight Crime]]|year=2018|isbn=|location=[[Medellin, Colombia]]|pages=3-84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price controls introduced by President Chávez in 2003 helped establish kleptocratic practices that still occur in Venezuela today, allowing officials to buy dollars for cheap and then exchange them bolívares at a higher black market rate so they could exchange for more dollars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It has been estimated that between the mid-2000s and the mid-2010s, over $300 billion dollars were misused by the Bolivarian government.&lt;ref name="WPmay2016" /&gt; The opposition-led National Assembly estimated that about $87 billion had been embezzled between multiple projects, including $27 billion by the Ministry of Food, $25 billion by the Ministry of Electricity, $22 billion for unfinished transportation works $11 billion by PDVSA and $1.5 billion by the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref name="TRANSven17"&gt;{{cite web|title=AN ha detectado malversación superior a 87 mil millones de dólares-Transparencia Venezuela|url=https://transparencia.org.ve/an-ha-detectado-malversacion-superior-87-mil-millones-dolares-2/|website=Transparencia Venezuela|accessdate=9 May 2017|language=es-ES|date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government-owned companies===
According to ''USA Today'', the policies of Chávez's "Socialism for the 21st century" included "the bloating of state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA, with patronage hires" which led to mismanagement of the petroleum industry in Venezuela according to experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Peter|title=Venezuela's PDVSA oil company is bloated, 'falling apart'|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/world/story/2012-05-28/venezuela-oil/55248628/1|accessdate=23 December 2014|agency=USA Today|date=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Financial Times'' also called the PDVSA "a source of patronage" and that "the number of employees, hired on the basis of their loyalty to the 'Bolivarian Revolution', has tripled since 2003 to more than 121,000".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mander|first1=Benedict|title=Venezuela: Up in smoke|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e0cdedba-fe4e-11e1-8228-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3MgKtncKV|accessdate=23 December 2014|agency=Financial Times|date=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Rafael Ramírez, then energy minister, gave PDVSA workers a choice: Support President Hugo Chávez, or lose their jobs. The minister also said: "PDVSA is red [the color identified with Chávez's political party], red from top to bottom". Chávez defended Ramírez, saying that public workers should back the "revolution". He added that "PDVSA's workers are with this revolution, and those who aren't should go somewhere else.

=== Governorships ===
Under both Chávez and Maduro, if Bolivarian candidates lost gubernatorial elections, the presidents would name the candidates "Protectors" to act as governors of the state, an action that is non-existent in Venezuelan law. Chávez and Maduro would instead recognize the "Protectors" and provide funds to establish a parallel government to opposition governors who were elected.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=El ocaso del chavismo: Venezuela 2005-2015|last=López Maya|first=Margarita|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=9788417014254|location=|pages=367-369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local Committees of Supply and Production (CLAP)===
[[File:Carnet de la Patria.png|200px|thumb|right|Venezuelans required government issued ''Carnet de la Patria (Card of the Homeland)'' cards to receive CLAP food.]]
While Venezuelans were suffering from shortages of food, the Bolivarian government created the Local Committees of Supply and Production (CLAP). The committees, controlled by supporters of President Maduro, were designated to provide subsidized food and goods to poor Venezuelan households directly. According to the Vice President of Venezuela, [[Aristóbulo Istúriz]], CLAPs are a "political instrument to defend the revolution". Allegations arose that only supporters of Maduro and the government were provided food while critics were denied access to goods. PROVEA, a Venezuelan human rights group, described CLAPs as "a form of food discrimination that is exacerbating social unrest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zuñiga|first1=Mariana|title=How ‘food apartheid’ is punishing some Venezuelans|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/10/venezuelas-food-apartheid-is-leaving-some-people-hungry/|accessdate=10 December 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Caja_CLAP.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Caja_CLAP.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|A food box provided by CLAP, with the supplier receiving government funds owned by President [[Nicolas Maduro]]]][[Luisa Ortega Díaz]], Chief Prosecutor of Venezuela from 2007 to 2017 revealed that President Maduro had been profiting from the food crisis.

On 19 April 2018 after a multilateral meeting between over a dozen European and Latin American countries, [[United States Department of the Treasury]] officials stated that they had collaborated with Colombian officials to investigate corrupt import programs of the Maduro administration including CLAP, explaining that Venezuelan officials pocketed 70% of the proceeds allocated for importation programs destined to alleviate hunger in Venezuela.

Venezuela's judicial system has been deemed the most corrupt in the world by [[Transparency International]].&lt;ref name="TRANSPcorrupt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/country#VEN|title=Corruption by Country / Territory: Venezuela|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch accuse Hugo Chávez and his allies of taking over the Supreme Court in 2004, filling it with supporters and making new measures allowing the government to dismiss justices from the court.&lt;ref name=HRW2012/&gt; In 2010, legislators from Chávez’s political party appointed 9 permanent judges and 32 stand-ins, which included several allies.&lt;ref name=HRW2012/&gt; HRW fears that judges may face reprisals if they rule against government interests.&lt;ref name=HRW2012/&gt;

In December 2014, moderate left newspaper ''[[El Espectador]]'' stated in an article about the accusations against [[María Corina Machado]] saying that prosecutions in Venezuela go by a "familiar script", stating that "[t]he executive branch first publicly launches accusations at an opposition politician, state prosecutors then set about compiling formal charges, and the entire process is ultimately confirmed by the Supreme Court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No Room For Dissent: Democracy At Stake In Venezuela|url=http://www.worldcrunch.com/world-affairs/no-room-for-dissent-democracy-at-stake-in-venezuela/leopoldo-l-pez-mar-a-corina-machado-socialist-jail/c1s17696/#.VI38tIed7ww|accessdate=14 December 2014|agency=El Especatdor|date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public opinion====
In a 2014 Gallup poll, 61% of Venezuelan's lack confidence in the judicial system.&lt;ref name="GALLUPven"/&gt; According to the World Justice Project's ''Rule of Law Index 2015'', Venezuela's justice system was ranked third to last in the world while its criminal justice system was ranked worst in the world according to surveys.&lt;ref name=WJP2015/&gt; The ''Rule of Law Index 2015'' also showed that 79% of Venezuelans believed there was corruption in the judicial system, with 95% believing there was improper influence by the Bolivarian government with [[civil justice]] and 100% believing that there was improper influence in [[criminal justice]].&lt;ref name=WJP2015/&gt;

===Police===
According to some sources Venezuela's corruption includes widespread corruption in the police force.&lt;ref name=PostCrime&gt;Reel, M.

'''DAD-IS''' is the [[acronym]] of the worldwide '''Domestic Animal Diversity Information System''' of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], within the FAO's management of animal genetic resources programme.&lt;ref name="DAD-IS"&gt;Domestic Animal Diversity Information System
(DADIS)- About. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. {{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/dadis/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021071803/http://www.fao.org/dadis/ |archivedate=21 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a searchable [[database]] of information about [[breed]]s, the Global Databank for Animal Genetic Resources; it also holds tools for management, and contacts for the National and Regional Coordinators for the programme.&lt;ref name="DAD-IS"/&gt; Data from [http://dad.fao.org/ the Global Databank] is used for reporting on the global status and trends of animal genetic resources.

== Breeds in the Global Databank ==
There were 11,116 mammalian national breed populations in DAD-IS as of February 2016, and 3,799 avian national breed populations.&lt;ref name="2016 report"&gt;2016. FAO. Status of Animal Genetic Resources. http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/c40d538b-4765-445d-ba3c-c06eaaa49f4a/&lt;/ref&gt; These national breed populations represent a global total of 8,822 breeds, which includes 643 breeds (7%) that are reported to be extinct.&lt;ref name="2016 report"/&gt;  local breeds (only found in one region) make up 7,761 of entries, while 1,061 are [[transboundary breed]]s, meaning they are found in more than one region.

===Risk Status===
A total of 17% (about 1,500) of all DAD-IS breeds are classified as being at risk of [[extinction]], though this figure includes those that are {{em|already}} extinct but were entered into the database before disappearing. A further 58% are classified as being of unknown risk status. {{As of 2016|post=,}} these risk statuses have not been updated since 2014.&lt;ref name="2016 report"/&gt;

Domà Nunch was founded in 2005 as a spin-off project of the ''Moviment Spiritual Riformaa Nativ d'Insubria'' (''Reformed Spiritual Movement of Insubria's Natives''), previously created in 2003 by Lorenzo Banfi &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Documento: Il Movimento Spirituale Riformato dei Nativi d'Insubria")|url=http://www.cesnur.org/2003/insubria.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;, renewing and reissuing ''El Dragh Bloeu'' (The Blue Dragon), which then became the official magazine of the new association&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eldraghbloeu.eu ''Website closed in 2013''&lt;/ref&gt;. Lorenzo Banfi, linguist and author, led Domà Nunch as president as soon as the organisation got expanded in 2007. Domà Nunch believed in [[self-determination]] and independence of Insubria as way to preserve the heritage, history, language and environment of the region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Provincia dell'Insubria? Lavoriamo per una Comunità Nazionale!|url=http://www.domanunch.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=245&amp;Itemid=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It also promotes the re-unification of portions of Insubria presently split among [[Lombardy]], Piedmont, and [[Switzerland]]. Though, Domà Nunch never or limitely defined itself to belong the traditional independentist political area, rather outlining to be "national" movement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lorenzo Banfi: "E' il momento di fare qualcosa di concreto per una rivoluzione epocale"|url=http://www.domanunch.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=260:restaurada-la-conchetta-i-barch-a-tornen-in-gesa-rossa-&amp;catid=86:notizie&amp;Itemid=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Domà Nunch was opposed to the urbanization and concreting of the land. Particularly, their members had been against new highway projects, such as the ''Pedemontana Lombarda'' proposed by the [[Regional Council of Lombardy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In piazza contro Pedemontana, l'Osvo lancia la sfida|url=http://www3.varesenews.it/busto/articolo.php?id=155212}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, Domà Nunch aimed to maintain taxation locally in Insubria in order to reclaim the land. Temporarily cooperations led to merge Domà Nunch's actions with major campaigning environmentalist organisations, such as [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], [[Italia Nostra]], [[Fondo per l'Ambiente Italiano]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Terza Pista di Malpensa: "Un'elemosina che non compensa il danno ambientale".

In the first activity period, Domà Nunch had published a number of books on ecology and [[local language]], as well as organised events. These included:
* The ''National Day of Insubria'', every 5 September, according to the date of foundation of the [[Duchy of Milan]];
* Commemoration of the [[ICMESA]] disaster in [[Seveso]];
* The ''Forum on Environmental Emergencies in Insubria'', in 2007, [[Uboldo]];
* The ''Forum on the Milanese Language'', in 2007, [[Nerviano]], attended by the major linguistic associations of the region;
* The conference ''Olona: A Valley at Its Crossroad'', in 2008, [[Gorla Minore]];
* ''Olona: A Valley Festival'' in 2008;
* Street rallies against the A36 (Autostrada Pedemontana Lombarda) project, in 2009 and 2010.

In 2010 Domà Nunch replied to the [[Enlargement of Switzerland]] motion proposing an integration between Switzerland and Insubria in order to join into a new confederation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Domà Nunch rilancia: lavoriamo insieme per una confederazione elvetico-insubre|url=http://www.domanunch.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=772:doma-nunch-rilancia-lavoriamo-insieme-per-una-confederazione-elvetico-insubre&amp;catid=99:doma-nunch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725211308/http://www.domanunch.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=772%3Adoma-nunch-rilancia-lavoriamo-insieme-per-una-confederazione-elvetico-insubre&amp;catid=99%3Adoma-nunch|archivedate=25 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to Grind Gadaffi's Gears: Three Greater Switzerlands|url=http://bigthink.com/ideas/20991}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Political movement==

===First Period===
In December 2011, Domà Nunch actually ceased its activity as a cultural association and changed into a [[political movement]] with the target to run for the [[Lombard regional election, 2013]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Autonomisti e verdi, ma non-leghisti|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2011/12/05/doma-nunch/175324/}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though this never actually happened.

In February 2012, Domà Nunch provoked the public opinion by issuing a [[local currency]] called ''Franch''&lt;ref&gt;The word is equivalent to Lira in [[Lombard language]].&lt;/ref&gt; stating this would be "''the money of the people, to save our economy''". Issued banknotes were portraying hystorical lombard characters like [[Francesco II Sforza]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Il movimento econazionalista padano  (ma non leghista) lancia la sua moneta|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2012/02/15/movimento-econazionalista-padano-leghista-lancia-moneta/191273/}}{{cite news|title=Il movimento econazionalista lancia la sua moneta|url=http://www.wallstreetitalia.com/article/1323884/secessione/il-movimento-nazionalista-padano-lancia-la-sua-moneta.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In September of the same year, Domà Nunch activists had been attacked by individuals linked with left-wing social center and [[Italian General Confederation of Labour]] while the econationalists ralling in [[Desio]] against [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] presence in Insubria and Pedemontana motorway construction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Desio tentata aggressione dei centri sociali contro Domà Nunch|url=http://www.lindipendenza.com/a-desio-tentata-aggressione-dei-centri-sociali-contro-doma-nunch/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502005614/http://www.lindipendenza.com/a-desio-tentata-aggressione-dei-centri-sociali-contro-doma-nunch/|archivedate=2 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domà Nunch claimed CGIL to have responsibility in the tempted assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Domà Nunch: la Cgil spieghi le sue responsabilità nei fatto di Desio|url=http://www.lindipendenza.com/domo-nunch-la-cgil-spieghi-le-sue-responsabilita-nei-fatto-di-desio/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502005510/http://www.lindipendenza.com/domo-nunch-la-cgil-spieghi-le-sue-responsabilita-nei-fatto-di-desio/|archivedate=2 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

After this stage, in April 2013 Domà Nunch signed a cooperation agreement with ''Terra Insubre''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Terra Insubre e Domà Nunch insieme per una "comunità nazionale"|url=http://www.lindipendenza.com/doma-nunch-terra-insubre/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927211804/http://www.lindipendenza.com/doma-nunch-terra-insubre/|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Terra Insubre e Domà Nunch insieme per una "comunità nazionale"|url=http://www.ininsubria.it/terra-insubre-e-doma-nunch-insieme-per-una-comunita-nazionale~A10999/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424105847/http://www.ininsubria.it/terra-insubre-e-doma-nunch-insieme-per-una-comunita-nazionale~A10999|archivedate=24 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a cultural association based in [[Varese]] and [[Milan]] that shared most of Domà Nunch's objectives. This led to a convention in Milan on 4 May to remember the [[Bava-Beccaris massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=4 maggio, Milano: "Insubria ribelle".

In December 2013 Domà Nunch communicated to put on hold its political activity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=

===Second Period===
At the end of 2014 the movement published and presented the booklet ''Appunti per una Repubblica Sacra'' (''Notes for a Sacred Republic'') stating the "felt need to consolidate the definition of the political and spiritual vision" and "with the intend to outline the peculiarity of the argumentations proposed, and claim in a more official way the paternity of the ideas expressed in the last years"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=

In 2015, Domà Nunch announced to take part at the elections for the municipality of [[Saronno]] in alliance with [[Lega Nord]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2016">[[File:dontmourn.jpg|right|thumb|The cover of the compilation album which uses the phrase]]
'''"Don't mourn, organize!"''' is an expression often incorrectly supposed to be the last words spoken by activist and songwriter [[Joe Hill]], who was falsely charged with murder and executed in Utah in 1915. In truth, the expression is part of a telegram sent to [[Bill Haywood]], in which Joe wrote, "Goodbye, Bill, I die like a true blue rebel. Don't waste any time mourning. Organize!" It wasn't Joe's last telegram; he sent another in which he implored Haywood, "Could you arrange to have my body hauled to the state line to be buried? I don't want to be found dead in Utah."&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pp. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the death of Hill, the phrase has been used both in association with other labour leaders' deaths and on the occasion of severe defeats. It is particularly popular within the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. 

The phrase is popular enough in its association with Joe Hill and the labour movement that it was the title of a music compilation made in 1990 and released by Smithsonian Folkways. The full title is ''Don't Mourn — Organize!: Songs of Labor Songwriter Joe Hill''.

In 2010, after the death of [[Howard Zinn]], a ''Boston Globe'' article was titled with this phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2010/01/29/zinn_dont_mourn_organize/ |title=Zinn: Don’t mourn, organize! |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=January 29, 2010 |accessdate=2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, activists have used the phrase to motivate protest against [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] and [[Presidency of Donald Trump|his administration]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[File:Couder Stati generali.jpg|thumb|350px|Painting by [[Auguste Couder]] showing the General]]The '''Estates General of 1789''' was a general assembly representing the French [[estates of the realm]]: the clergy (First Estate), the nobility (Second Estate), and the commoners (Third Estate). Summoned by [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]], it was brought to an end when the Third Estate formed into a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], inviting the other two to join, against the wishes of the King. This signaled the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]].

== The decision to summon the Estates ==

=== First Assembly of Notables and peasants ===
The suggestion to summon the Estates General came from the [[Assembly of Notables]] installed by the King on 22 February 1787. It had not met since 1614. The usual business of registering the King's edicts as law was performed by the [[Parlement of Paris]]. In this year it was refusing to cooperate with [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]]'s program of badly needed financial reform, due to the special interests of its noble members. Calonne was the Controller-General of Finances, appointed by the King to address the state deficit. As a last measure, Calonne was hoping to bypass them by reviving an archaic institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The initial roster of Notables included 137 nobles, among them many future revolutionaries, such as the [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Comte de Mirabeau]] and the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], hero of the [[American Revolution]]. Lafayette had served in [[George Washington]]'s army. Much of the debt had been incurred on behalf of the Americans. The final defeat of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown|Battle of Yorktown]] was due in large part to the participation of the French army and navy. If Calonne thought he would find more cooperation by changing the assembly, he was mistaken. He proposed a "land tax," ''Subvention Territoriale'', to be imposed on all land-holders, rich or poor. A storm of protest arose. Charges of mismanagement were made. Calonne was dismissed on 8 April 1787 and then was exiled. He commented on the French political scene from London.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=63–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calonne's replacement was [[Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne]], President of the Assembly of Notables. He was offered the post of Prime Minister, which was to include being Controller. The Notables nevertheless remained recalcitrant. They made a number of proposals but they would not grant the King money. Lafayette suggested that the problem required a national assembly. Brienne asked him if he meant the Estates General. On receiving an affirmative answer, Brienne recorded it as a proposal. Frustrated by his inability to obtain money, the King staged a day-long harangue, and then on 25 May dissolved the Notables. Their proposals reverted to the Parlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle:1902|pp=70–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rebellion of the parliament ===
Turning again to the parliament, the King found that they were inclined to continue the issues that had been raised in the Assembly of Notables. Their proper legal function, besides giving advice to the King, was only to register, or record, his edicts as law, a matter of simple obedience, which the King's father and grandfather had been able to command, sometimes by sternness, threats, and losses of temper. Unless registered, the edicts were not lawful.

On 6 July 1787, Loménie forwarded the ''Subvention Territoriale'' and another tax, the ''Edit du Timbre'', or "Stamp Act," based on the American model, for registration. Parlement refused an illegal act, demanding accounting statements, or "States," as a prior condition. It was the King's turn to refuse. The members of the Parlement began to jest that they required either the accounting States or the Estates General. The King could not let this slight to his authority pass. Parlement was commanded to assemble at the King's palace at Versailles where, on 6 August, he [[Lit de justice|ordered them in person]] to register the taxes. On 7 August back in Paris, the Parlement declared, in earnest this time, that the order was null and void, repudiating all previous registrations of taxes. Only the Estates General, they said, could register taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the second time, the King summoned Parlement away from Paris, where crowds of people cheered their every act from the street, this time to meet at Troyes, Champagne on 15 August. He did not personally appear. By messenger he and Parlement negotiated an agreement: the King withdrew the Stamp Tax and modified the Land Tax to exclude the lands of people of title in return for the assured registration of further loans. Parlement was allowed to return on 20 September. Encouraged, Loménie, with the support of the King, went beyond the intent of the Parlement which was to grant specific loans. He proposed an Emprunt Successif (Successive Loan) until 1792 giving the King a [[blank cheque]]. When Parlement delayed the King resorted to a ruse; he scheduled a Royal Hunt for 19 November. On that day at 11:00 AM the King and his peers noisily entered the session of Parlement dressed in hunting clothes. They would confer with each other and have the decisions registered immediately, they said.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly the entire government was now face-to-face. They argued the problems and issues concerned until dusk, some six hours later. Parlement believed that the problem had gone beyond the government and needed the decisions of the Estates General which did not correspond to the King's concept of monarchy. At the end of the day, the King demanded the registration of the Successive Loan. The [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Duc d'Orléans]] (a previous Notable, a relative of the King, and an ardent revolutionary), known as ''Philippe Égalité'', asked if this were a Royal Session of the Peers or a Session of Parlement. On being told it was a Royal Session he replied that edicts were not registered at Royal Sessions. The King retorted, ''Vous êtes bien le maître'' (do as YOU will) with some sarcasm as the King's will was legally required, and strode angrily from the session with a retinue. ''[[Lettre de cachet|Lettres de Cachet]],'' or arbitrary arrest warrants, followed on the 20th for D'Orleans and two others. They were taken into custody and held under comfortable conditions away from Paris; D'Orleans on his country estate. Parlement began a debate on the legality of ''Lettres de Cachet''. The men being held became a ''cause célèbre.''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the King and Parlement could accomplish no more together De Brienne, over the winter, pressed for an alternative plan; to resurrect even more archaic institutions. The ''Grand Bailliages,'' or larger legal jurisdictions that once had existed, would assume Parlement legal functions, while the Plenary Court, last known under [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], when it had the power to register edicts, would assume the registration duties of the Parlement, leaving it with no duties to perform. The King planned a sudden revelation and dismissal of Parlement. However, [[Jean-Jacques Duval d'Eprémesnil]] heard the government presses running and bribed the printer to give him the proofs of the edict. Hearing it read the next day, 3 May 1788, Parlement swore an oath not to be disbanded and defined a manifesto of their rights.

Warrants were issued for Eprémesnil and another but they escaped from their homes over the rooftops in the early morning to seek refuge in Parlement. The King sent his guards into Parlement to arrest them. They surrendered. Parlement filed silently out between a line of guards. The commander gave the key to the building to the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=86–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Return of Necker ===
The transfer of power to the new government was to begin on 8 May 1788 with the registration of the edicts establishing it in the regional Parlement. The latter refused unanimously following the Parlement of Paris. If the King's commissioners forced the issue Parlement abandoned the meeting place only to return the next day to declare the registration null and void. Armed protest swept the kingdom. Street fighting broke out at [[Rennes]], Brittany. A deputation sent to Paris from there was imprisoned in the [[Bastille]]. The [[Breton people|Bretons]] in Paris founded the Breton Club, later the [[Jacobin]] Society. The Grand Bailliages could not be created and the Plenary Court met only once.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=95–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Convening the Estates-General ==

=== Edict of 24 January 1789 ===
The Estates-General were summoned by a royal edict dated to 24 January 1789. It comprised two parts: a ''Lettre du Roi,'' and a ''Règlement''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Louis XVI | title=Lettre du Roi pour la Convocation des États-Généraux a Versailles, le 27 Avril, 1789, et Règlement y Annexé | location=Paris | publisher=L'Imprimerie Royale | year=1789 | page=3 | quote=Nous avons besoin du concours de nos fidèles Sujets, pour nous aider à surmonter toutes les difficultés où nous nous trouvons relativement à l'état de nos finances .... Ces grands motifs nous ont déterminés à convoquer l'assemblée des États de toutes les Provinces de notre obéissance ....}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Lettre'' announces:
:"We have need of a concourse of our faithful subjects, to assist us surmount all the difficulties we find relative to the state of our finances... These great motives have resolved us to convoke the ''assemblée des États'' of all the provinces under our authority ...."

The King promises to address the grievances of his people. The "most notable persons" of each community and judicial district are summoned "to confer and to record remonstrances, complaints, and grievances." Elections for Deputies are to be held. He says that he intends "reform of abuse," "establishment of a fixed and durable order," and "general prosperity." The ''Lettre'' is signed "Louis."

''Lettres de Convocation'' were sent to all the provinces with the ''Règlement'' prescribing the methods of election. During the preceding autumn the Parlement of Paris, an aristocratic advisory body to the King, had decided that the organization of the convention would be the same as in 1614, the last time the Estates had met. As 175 years had gone by since then it is clear the Estates were not a functional institution in French society. By reviving them as much as possible like they had been the King and the Parlement intended to control the authority of the people. The previous Estates had voted by order; that is, the Nobles and the Clergy could together outvote the Commons by 2 to 1.

If on the other hand, each delegate were to have one vote, the majority would prevail. The issue was widely discussed in the press during the autumn of 1788. The people would nevertheless accept any national convention confident that enough members of the Nobility and the Clergy would be with them to sway the votes. A National Party was formed. It argued that France had never had a constitution and the proper function of the Convention was to establish one. The royalist defenders, however, accepted the absolute monarchy as the constitution. Just to be certain the press began to demand that the Commons be allocated twice as many delegates as each of the other two Estates. In an attempt to bolster his failing popularity the King acceded to this measure of "doubling the Third." He was confident of his influence over the Nobility and Clergy.&lt;ref&gt;The analysis of the preceding two paragraphs is that of {{harvnb | Neely | 2008 | pp=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elections of early Spring 1789 ===
The First Estate represented 100,000 Catholic clergy; the Church owned about 10 percent of the land and collected its own taxes (the tithe) on peasants. The lands were controlled by bishops and abbots of monasteries, but two-thirds of the 303 delegates from the First Estate were ordinary parish priests; only 51 were bishops.&lt;ref&gt;William Doyle, '' The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) p 59&lt;/ref&gt;  The Second Estate represented the
nobility, about 400,000 men and women who owned about 25 percent of the land and collected seigneurial dues and rents from their peasant tenants. About a third of the 282 deputies representing the Second Estate were nobles, mostly with minor holdings. The Third Estate representation was doubled to 578 men, representing 95 percent of the population of roughly 25 million. Half were well-educated lawyers or local officials. Nearly a third were in trades or industry; 51 were wealthy land owners.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) pp. 99–101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Soboul, ''The French Revolution 1787–1799'' (1975) pp. 127–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Réglement'' that went out by post in January thus specified separate voting for delegates of each Estate. Each tax district (cities, boroughs, and parishes) would elect their own delegates to the Third Estate. The ''Bailliages'', or judicial districts, would elect delegates to the First and Second Estates in separate ballots. Each voting assembly would also collect a ''Cahier'', or "Notebook", of grievances to be considered by the Convocation. The election rules differed somewhat depending on the type of voting unit, whether city, parish or some other. Generally, the distribution of delegates was by population: the most populous locations had the greatest number of delegates. The City of Paris was thus dominant. The electorate consisted of males 25 years and older, property owners, and registered taxpayers. They could be native or naturalized citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Boyer | first1=John W. | last2=Kirshner | first2=Julius | year=1986 | editor1-first=Keith Michael | editor1-last=Baker | title=From Reform to Revolution | work=The Old Regime and the French Revolution | series=University of Chicago readings in Western civilization | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | pages=180–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of delegates elected was about 1,200, half of whom formed the Third Estate. The First and Second Estates had 300 each. But French society had changed since 1614, and these Estates-General were not identical to those of 1614. Members of the nobility were not required to stand for election to the Second Estate, and many of them were elected to the Third Estate. The total number of nobles in the three Estates was about 400. Noble representatives of the Third Estate were among the most passionate revolutionaries in attendance, including [[Jean Joseph Mounier]] and the [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|comte de Mirabeau]]. Despite their status as elected representatives of the Third Estate, many of these nobles were executed by guillotine during the Terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Guttner|first=Darius|title=The French Revolution|year=2015|publisher=Nelson Cengage|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nobles in the Second Estate were the richest and most powerful in the kingdom. The King could count on them, but that was of little use to him in the succeeding course of history. He had also expected that the First Estate would be predominantly the noble Bishops. The electorate, however, returned mainly parish priests, most of whom were sympathetic to the Commons. The Third Estate elections returned predominantly magistrates and lawyers. The lower levels of society, the landless, working men, though present in large numbers in street gangs, were totally absent from the Estates-General, as the King had called for "the most notable persons".

The grievances returned were mainly about taxes, which the people considered a crushing burden.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, Gail M.; Jeanneney, John R. (1995-01-01). [https://books.google.com/books?id=ne3jNvz-gXAC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=Estates+General+1789+election&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNuM2y9NTTAhXqr1QKHQ1jDNwQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Estates%20General%201789%20election&amp;f=false ''The French Revolution of 1789 and Its Impact'']. Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the people and the King were totally at odds from the very beginning. Aristocratic privilege was also attacked. The people resented the fact that nobles could excuse themselves from most of the burden of taxation and service that fell on the ordinary people. A third type complained that the ubiquitous tolls and duties levied by the nobility hindered internal commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Elections results come from {{harvnb | Neely | 2008 | pp=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opening of the Convention ===
On 5 May 1789,&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, Thomas Henry; Hassall, Arthur (1901-01-01). [https://books.google.com/books?id=v7kyAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA466&amp;dq=May+5th+1789&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje06ytlNDTAhVU3GMKHU-kBk8Q6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=May%205th%201789&amp;f=false ''1679-1789'']. G. Bell and sons.&lt;/ref&gt; amidst general festivities, the Estates-General convened in an elaborate but temporary ''Île des États'' set up in one of the courtyards of the official [[Menus-Plaisirs du Roi|Hôtel des Menus Plaisirs]] in the town of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] near the royal [[château]]. With the ''étiquette'' of 1614 strictly enforced, the clergy and nobility ranged in tiered seating in their full regalia, while the physical locations of the deputies from the Third Estate were at the far end, as dictated by the protocol. When Louis XVI and [[Charles Louis François de Paule de Barentin]], the Keeper of the Seals of France, addressed the deputies on 6 May, the Third Estate discovered that the royal decree granting double representation also upheld the traditional voting "by orders", i.e. that the collective vote of each estate would be weighed equally.

The apparent intent of the King and of Barentin was for everyone to get directly to the matter of taxes. The larger representation of the Third Estate would remain merely a symbol while giving them no extra power. Director-General of Finance [[Jacques Necker]] had more sympathy for the Third Estate, but on this occasion he spoke only about the fiscal situation, leaving it to Barentin to speak on how the Estates-General was to operate.

Trying to avoid the issue of representation and to focus solely on taxes, the King and his ministers had gravely misjudged the situation. The Third Estate wanted the estates to meet as one body and for each delegate to have one vote. The other two estates, while having their own grievances against royal absolutism, believed – correctly, as history was to prove – that they stood to lose more power to the Third Estate than they stood to gain from the King. Necker sympathized with the Third Estate in this matter, but the astute financier lacked equal astuteness as a politician. He decided to let the ''impasse'' play out to the point of stalemate before he would enter the fray. As a result, by the time the King yielded to the demand of the Third Estate, it seemed to all to be a concession wrung from the monarchy, rather than a magnanimous gift that would have convinced the populace of the King's goodwill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sparknotes.com/history/european/frenchrev/section2.rhtml SparkNotes: ''the French Revolution'' (1789–1799): ''The Estates-General'': 1789]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings and dissolution==

The Estates-General reached an impasse. The Second Estate pushed for meetings that were to transpire in three separate locations, as they had traditionally. The [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Comte de Mirabeau]], a noble himself but elected to represent the Third Estate, tried but failed to keep all three orders in a single room for this discussion. Instead of discussing the King's taxes, the three estates began to discuss separately the organization of the legislature. These efforts continued without success until 27 May, when the nobles voted to stand firm for separate verification. The following day, the [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Abbé Sieyès]] (a senior member of the clergy, but, like Mirabeau, elected to represent the Third Estate) moved that the representatives of the Third Estate, who now called themselves the ''Communes'' ("Commons"), proceed with verification and invite the other two estates to take part, but not to wait for them.

On 13 June 1789, the Third Estate had arrived at a resolution to examine and settle the powers of the three orders. They invited the clergy and nobles to work with them on this endeavor. On 17 June, with the failure of efforts to reconcile the three estates, the ''Communes'' completed their own process of verification and almost immediately voted a measure far more radical: they declared themselves redefined as the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], an assembly not of the estates, but of the people. They invited the other orders to join them but made it clear that they intended to conduct the nation's affairs with or without them. As their numbers exceeded the combined numbers of the other estates, they could dominate any combined assembly.

The King tried to resist. Under the influence of the courtiers of his [[privy council]], he resolved to go in state to the Assembly, annul its decrees, command the separation of the orders, and dictate the reforms to be effected by the restored Estates-General. On 20 June, he ordered the hall where the National Assembly met, closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6alTDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Tennis%20Court%20Oath&amp;f=false|title=The World of the French Revolution|last=Palmer|first=Robert R.|date=2016-06-10|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317189565|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly moved their deliberations to the nearby [[Jeu de paume|tennis]] court, where they proceeded to swear the '[[Tennis Court Oath]]', by which they agreed not to separate until they had settled the constitution of France. Two days later, deprived of the use of the tennis court as well, the Assembly met in the [[Versailles Cathedral|Church of Saint Louis]], where the majority of the representatives of the clergy joined them: efforts to restore the old order had served only to accelerate events.

In the ''séance royale'' of 23 June, the King granted a ''Charte octroyée'', a constitution granted by royal favor, which affirmed, subject to the traditional limitations, the right of separate deliberation for the three orders, which constitutionally formed three chambers. This move failed; soon, that part of the deputies of the nobles who still stood apart joined the National Assembly at the request of the King. The Estates-General had ceased to exist, having become the National Assembly (and after 9 July 1789, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]]).

'''Eva Cadena Sandoval''' is a Mexican politician that belonged to the [[National Regeneration Movement|MORENA]] party. She gained national infamy when hidden videos were released of her taking money that she alleged was for party funding. She subsequently became known on [[social media]] as '''La Recaudadora''' (The Collecter).

==Early life==
Cadena was born in [[Tlalmanalco]], [[Estado de México]] and moved to Las Choapas, Vercruz at age 7.&lt;ref name="Excel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atrapa escándalo a una “franciscana”; perfil de Eva Cadena Sandoval|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2017/05/03/1161200|website=Excélsior|accessdate=11 July 2017|language=es|date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Cadena Sandoval began her career with a short-lived step by the ranks of the PRI in the early 2000s, but is expelled for not covering her quotas and begins to perform political work in the ranks of (PAN) National Action alongside Antonio Pouchoulen and Renato Tronco , from 2005 to 2013. 
With Morena, at 2016 she was a deputy in the state congress of Veracruz. She was a candidate for the mayorship of [[Las Choapas]], but her candidacy was revoked by the party following the scandal of the hidden videos.&lt;ref name="EU1"&gt;{{cite web|title=La "recaudadora" Eva Cadena volvió por más dinero|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/nacion/politica/2017/04/27/la-recaudadora-eva-cadena-volvio-por-mas-dinero|website=El Universal|accessdate=3 May 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandal==
A first video, published on April 24, 2017, shows Cadena taking $500,000 [[Mexican pesos]] from a woman whose face is not visible, with the money supposedly going to MORENA leader [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]].&lt;ref name="EU1" /&gt; In regards to this video, López Obrador said it was a "trick" released to slander and politically destroy the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Responde AMLO a la difusión de video sobre Eva Cadena|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2017/04/24/1159551|website=Excélsior|accessdate=3 May 2017|language=es|date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cadena claimed López Obrador did not know about the money and that she returned all of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Digital|first1=Milenio|title=AMLO no supo del dinero, yo soy responsable: Eva Cadena|url=http://www.milenio.com/politica/eva_cadena-amlo-500_mil_pesos-videoescandalo-morena-veracruz-milenio_noticias_0_944905533.html|website=Milenio|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second video, published on April 27, 2017, shows Cadena taking from the same woman $10,000 [[US dollars]] and $50,000 Mexican pesos, supposedly "for her campaign".&lt;ref name="EU1" /&gt; The woman offers an additional $5,000,000 pesos for López Obrador but would like to meet him in person, to which Cadena responds that she will tell "them".&lt;ref name="EU1" /&gt; She claimed this video was recorded when she went to return the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fórmula|first1=Grupo|title=Asegura Eva Cadena que segundo video es cuando devuelve el dinero|url=http://www.radioformula.com.mx/notas.asp?Idn=679687&amp;idFC=2017|website=www.radioformula.com.mx|accessdate=3 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The videos were leaked to the national newspaper ''[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]'' which subsequently published them. In an interview with the newspaper, Cadena claimed that the videos were altered and that she had asked the Attorney General of Veracruz to seek security videos from the hotel in which the transactions took place to find those responsible for the hidden videos.&lt;ref name="EU1" /&gt; The ''[[:es:Fiscalía Especializada para la Atención de los Delitos Electorales|Fiscalía Especializada para la Atención de Delitos Electorales]]'' (FEPADE) opened an investigation on Cadena's presumed misconduct.&lt;ref name="EU1" /&gt;

A third video published by ''El Universal'' on May 2, 2017 shows Cadena receiving $1,000,000 pesos from a supposed businessman as payment for her pushing for a favorable law in the Veracruz state congress.&lt;ref name="AN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tercer video de Eva Cadena, filtrado a ‘El Universal’; ella advierte que dará nombres|url=http://aristeguinoticias.com/0205/mexico/tercer-video-de-eva-cadena-filtrado-a-el-universal-ella-advierte-que-dara-nombres/|website=aristeguinoticias.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the third leak, Cadena stated she would step down to face charges, that the videos were altered and that she would release the names of those involved.&lt;ref name="AN" /&gt; The same day the video was released, she failed to attend a scheduled meeting with FEPADE.&lt;ref name="Mil"/&gt; The actions in the third video may constitute additional crimes that are outside of FEPADE jurisdiction and would require investigation from other agencies.&lt;ref name="Mil"&gt;{{cite web|last1=López|first1=Jannet|title=Eva Cadena falta a cita; Fepade pedirá apoyo de fuerza pública|url=http://www.milenio.com/politica/audiencia-fepade-eva_cadena-videoescandalo-delitos_electorales-milenio-noticias_0_949105174.html|website=Milenio|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2309">'''Exercise Deep Sabre''' is a multi-national maritime interdiction exercise conducted in August 2005 in [[South China Sea]].

Launched at the [[Changi Naval Base]] in [[Singapore]], the exercise is part of the [[Proliferation Security Initiative]]. It involved some 2,000 personnel from the military, coast guard, customs and other agencies of 13 countries, including Singapore, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the US.  Ten ships and six maritime patrol aircraft were involved in the exercise that aimed to develop and practice effective procedures to prevent the proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]].

==Sea Phase==

The sea phase of the exercise was conducted during 15-17 August 2005.

It began with the deployment of maritime and air assets from participating countries to detect, localise and track the merchant ship (simulated by MV Avatar) transporting the illegal shipment of dual-use chemicals. Once located, a request was made for the ship to voluntarily divert to port for a search. When the ship’s master refused, flag state consent was sought, and given, for the ship to be interdicted and diverted to Singapore for the port search.

A team from the [[Republic of Singapore Navy]]’s [[Naval Diving Unit (Singapore)|Naval Diving Unit]] (NDU) was the first to board the vessel. After the ship was secured by the NDU team, follow-on forces from the [[Singapore Armed Forces]]  [[Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosive Defence Group]], the [[Japan Coast Guard]] and [[Australian Customs Service]] boarded the vessel and conducted a preliminary search and investigation. Following indications of a suspicious cargo on board, the ship was escorted to Singapore’s port for a detailed search by domestic enforcement agencies.

==Port Search Phase==

From  Aug 15-19 2005 joint government and military teams searched cargo container in Singapore's Pasir Panjang Scanning Station for weapons of mass destruction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6744">'''Extended Access Control''' (EAC) is a set of advanced security features for [[Biometric passport|electronic passports]] that protects and restricts access to sensitive personal data contained in the [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] chip. In contrast to common personal data (like the bearer’s photograph, names, date of birth, etc.) which can be protected by basic mechanisms, more sensitive data (like [[fingerprint]]s or iris images) must be protected further for preventing unauthorized access and skimming. A chip protected by EAC will allow that this sensitive data is read (through an encrypted channel) only by an authorized passport inspection system.&lt;ref&gt;

A general idea is given: the chip must contain chip-individual keys, must have processing capabilities and additional key management will be required. However, ICAO leaves the actual solution open to the implementing States.

There are several different proposed implementations of the mechanism, all of which must retain [[Backward compatibility|backward-compatibility]] with the [[Legacy system|legacy]] [[Basic Access Control]] (BAC), which is mandatory in all [[European Union|EU]] countries. The European Commission described that the technology will be used to protect fingerprints in member states' e-passports. The deadline for member states to start issuing fingerprint-enabled e-passports was set to be 28 June 2009. The specification selected for EU e-passports was prepared by the German [[Federal Office for Information Security]] (BSI) in their technical report TR-03110.&lt;ref name="tr-03110"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Several other countries implement their own EAC.

==EAC as defined by the EU==

EAC as defined by the EU has two requirements: chip and terminal authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dennis Kugler|journal=Extended Access Control ; Infrastructure and control|year=2006|volume=1|url=http://www.interoptest-berlin.de/pdf/Kuegler_-_Extended_Access_Control.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chip authentication (for strong session encryption)===

The chip authentication specification defines a handheld device (CAP reader) with a smart card slot, a decimal keypad, and a display capable of displaying at least 12 characters. ''Chip authentication'' (CA) has two functions:
* To authenticate the chip and prove that the chip is genuine. Only a genuine chip can implement communication securely.
* To establish a strongly secured communication channel, using a chip-specific key pair with strong encryption and integrity protection.
Chip authentication has an add-on Basic Access Control (BAC) with protection against skimming and eavesdropping.

===Terminal authentication (access restricted to authorized terminals)===

''Terminal authentication'' (TA) is used to determine whether the ''inspection system'' (IS) is allowed to read sensitive data from the e-passport. The mechanism is based on digital certificates which come in the format of ''card verifiable'' certificates.
* Each inspection system is granted a ''card verifiable certificate'' (CVC) from a ''document verifier'' (DV). The inspection system's certificate is valid only for a short time period, typically between 1 day and 1 month.
* An inspection system may have several CVCs installed at any time, one for each country that allows it to read sensitive data.
* The CVC allows the inspection system to request one or more items of sensitive data, such as data for [[iris recognition|iris]] or [[fingerprint recognition]].&lt;ref name="eac-protocol"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A document verifier certificate is granted from the ''country verification certificate authority'' (CVCA). These certificates can be for domestic or foreign document verifiers. The certificates are typically issued for medium amounts of time, between half a month and 3 months. The CVCA is generated by each country and is typically valid for 6 months to 3 years.&lt;ref name="eac-protocol" /&gt;

The '''Folke Bernadotte Academy (FBA)''' ({{lang-sv|Folke Bernadotteakademin}}) is the [[Government agencies in Sweden|Swedish government agency]] for peace, security and development. FBA conducts training, research and method development in order to strengthen peacebuilding and statebuilding in conflict and post-conflict countries. The agency also recruits civilian personnel and expertise for peace operations and election observation missions led by the [[European Union|EU]], [[United Nations|UN]] and [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]]. The agency is named after Count [[Folke Bernadotte]], the first UN mediator.{{r|FDvB6}}

FBA is under the authority of the Swedish [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. The agency was established in 2002 and has two offices; in Stockholm and at Sandö in Sweden.{{r|Burén 2012 p. 178}} Apart from the somewhat 100 employees at the two offices, FBA has about 80 deployed employees around the world. The General-Director of FBA since 2012 is Sven-Eric Söder.

FBA works with various parts of the peace process:
* Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants
* Conflict prevention and conflict resolution
* Women, peace and security
* Leadership and political affairs
* Rule of law, human rights and election support
* Security sector reform
* Cooperation in peace operations
* Security in the field
FBA is part of Sweden's development aid within the field of peace and security. The agency is commissioned by the Swedish government to work with the Swedish development cooperation strategies with a number of conflict affected countries and regions.

Moreover, FBA administers two Swedish government grants. The Peace Million, that finances projects that focus on peace and security, and the so called 1325 Grants for organizations working with issues concerning women, peace and security.

FBA also manages The Peace Archive, a digital archive with documentation of Sweden’s contribution to international peace operations. In addition, the international secretariat of Challenges Forum is hosted by the FBA. Challenges Forum is a worldwide network of organizations dedicated to strengthening UN peace operations.

Christiania has been a source of controversy since its creation in a squatted military area in 1971. Its [[Cannabis in Denmark|cannabis]] trade was tolerated by authorities until 2004. Since then, relations between Christiania and Danish authorities have been strained. Since the beginning of the 2010s, the situation has been normalized and the common Danish law now applies to Christiana. 
== History ==

=== Barracks and ramparts ===
[[File:Christiania Downtown Map.jpg|thumb|Christiania Downtown Map]]
[[File:Entrée de Christiania.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Entrance to Christiania]]

The area of Christiania consists of the former military [[barracks]] of Bådsmandsstræde and parts of the city [[Defensive wall|ramparts]]. The ramparts and the borough of [[Christianshavn]] (then a separate city) were established in 1617 by King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] by reclaiming the low beaches and islets between Copenhagen and [[Amager]]. After the [[siege of Copenhagen]] during the [[Second Northern War]], the ramparts were reinforced during 1682 to 1692 under [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] to form a complete defense ring. The western ramparts of Copenhagen were demolished during the 19th century, but those of Christianshavn were allowed to remain. They are today considered among the finest surviving 17th century defence works in the world.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/tjenester/nyheder/christiania_historie.jsp |title=History of the Christiania area |accessdate=2008-02-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232758/http://www.kulturarv.dk/tjenester/nyheder/christiania_historie.jsp |archivedate=March 31, 2009 |df= }}, [[Heritage Agency of Denmark]], 12 March 2007 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The barracks of Bådsmandsstræde (''Bådsmandsstrædes Kaserne'') housed the [[Kongens Artilleriregiment|Royal Artillery Regiment]], the [[Army Materiel Command (Denmark)|Army Materiel Command]] and ammunition laboratories and depots. Less used after World War II, the barracks were abandoned between 1967 and 1971.

The adjacent area to the north, [[Holmen naval base|Holmen]], was Denmark's main naval base until the 1990s. It is an area in development, home to the new [[Copenhagen Opera House]] (not to be confused with the first and still existing venue called "Operaen", a concert venue in Christiania) and schools. An area further north is still used by the [[navy]], but open to the public during daytime.

The outermost defence line, Enveloppen, has been renamed ''Dyssen'' in Christiania language (except for the southernmost tip of it which was not annexed by Christiania). It is connected to central Christiania by a bridge across the main moat or can be reached by the path beginning at Christmas Møllers Plads. Four gunpowder storehouses line the [[redan]]s. They were built 1779-80 to replace a storage in central Copenhagen, at [[Østerport]], which exploded infamously in 1770, killing 50 people. The buildings are renamed ''Aircondition'', ''Autogena'', ''Fakirskolen'' (The Fakir School) and ''Kosmiske Blomst'' (Cosmic Flower) and have, although protected, been slightly altered from their historical state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/fredede-bygninger/oplev-danmarks-fredede-bygninger/ta-ud-og-kig/christiania/ |title=History of Christiania area |accessdate=2010-01-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001193758/http://www.kulturarv.dk/fredede-bygninger/oplev-danmarks-fredede-bygninger/ta-ud-og-kig/christiania/ |archivedate=October 1, 2011 |df= }}, Heritage Agency of Denmark {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Christiania depuis Notre Sauveur.jpg|thumb]]
The last Danish [[execution]] site, active from 1946 to 1950, can still be seen on the Second [[Redan]] close to the building called ''Aircondition''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.information.dk/19110 ''Skydeskuret på Amager''] (The shooting shed on Amager), [[Dagbladet Information|Information]], 29 May 2007 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wooden execution shed is gone, but the concrete foundation and a drain for the blood remain just next to the path. In total, 29 [[Capital punishment in Denmark#The post 1945 purges|World War II criminals]] were executed on the site. The last was Ib Birkedal, a high-level Danish [[Gestapo]] collaborator, on 20 July 1950.

=== Building and area protection ===
[[File:Christiania glass house - August 2007.jpg|thumb|Glass house in Freetown Christiania, one of the many idiosyncratic constructions exemplifying modern "architecture without architects".]]
In 2007, the National Heritage Agency proposed protection status for some of the ancient military buildings, now in Christiania. These are:
* ''Den grå hal'' ('The grey hall'), formerly a riding house with a unique Bohlendach roof construction, now Christiania's largest concert venue
* ''Den grønne hal'' ('The green hall'), originally a smaller riding house
* ''Mælkebøtten'' ('The dandelion')
* The Commander's house, a half-timbered building
* The 17th and 18th century powder magazines on the bastions.

Some of the historic buildings were altered after Christiania's takeover.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Founding of Christiania ===
After the military moved out, the area was only guarded by a few [[Security guard|watchmen]] and there was sporadic [[trespassing]] of [[homeless]] people using the empty buildings. On 4 September 1971, inhabitants of the surrounding neighborhood broke down the fence to take over parts of the unused area as a playground for their children.

Although the takeover was not necessarily organized in the beginning, some claim this happened as a protest against the Danish government. At the time there was a lack of affordable housing in Copenhagen.

On 26 September 1971, Christiania was declared open by [[Jacob Ludvigsen]], a well-known [[provo (movement)|provo]] and journalist who published a magazine called ''Hovedbladet'' ('The main paper'), which was intended for and successfully distributed to mostly young people. In the paper, Ludvigsen wrote an article in which he and five others explored what he termed 'The Forbidden City of the Military'. The article widely announced the proclamation of the free town, and among other things he wrote the following under the headline ''Civilians conquered the 'forbidden city' of the military'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jacob-ludvigsen.dk/?Christiania |title=Christiania |accessdate=2008-02-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230234028/http://www.jacob-ludvigsen.dk/?Christiania |archivedate=December 30, 2008 |df= }}, facsimiles of 'Hovedbladet', Jacob Ludvigsen's website {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christiania is the land of the settlers. It is the biggest opportunity so far to build up a society from scratch - while nevertheless still incorporating the remaining constructions. Own electricity plant, a bath-house, a giant athletics building, where all the seekers of peace could have their grand meditation - and yoga center. Halls where theater groups can feel at home. Buildings for the stoners who are too paranoid and weak to participate in the race ... Yes for those who feel the beating of the pioneer heart there can be no doubt as to the purpose of Christiania. It is the part of the city which has been kept secret to us - but no more.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ludvigsen was co-author of Christiania's [[mission statement]], dating from 1971, which offers the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The objective of Christiania is to create a self-governing society whereby each and every individual holds themselves responsible over the wellbeing of the entire community. Our society is to be economically self-sustaining and, as such, our aspiration is to be steadfast in our conviction that psychological and physical destitution can be averted.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The spirit of Christiania quickly developed into one of [[hippie|the hippie movement]], [[squatter|the squatter movement]], [[collectivism]] and [[anarchism]] in contrast to the site's previous military use.

The 1976 protest song ''I kan ikke slå os ihjel'' (translated: "You cannot kill us"), written by Tom Lunden of [[flower power]] rock group [[Bifrost (band)|Bifrost]], became the unofficial anthem of Christiania.&lt;ref&gt;Henrik Vesterberg, {{cite web |url=http://ibyen.dk/musik/article340487.ece |title=Sangene kan de i hvert fald ikke slå ihjel |accessdate=2009-03-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218152618/http://ibyen.dk/musik/article340487.ece |archivedate=February 18, 2012 |df= }}, ''Politiken'', July 11, 2007 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The community ===

[[Meditation]] and [[yoga]] have always been popular among the Christianites, and for many years Christiania had a theatrical group Solvognen, who, beyond their theatre performances, also staged many happenings in Copenhagen and throughout Sweden. Ludvigsen had always talked of the acceptance of drug-addicts who could no longer cope with regular society, and the spirit of that belief has still not diminished, even though many problems sprouted due to drug traffic and use (mostly of 'hard drugs', however, which are not tolerated in Christiania). These addicts enter and remain in Christiania and are considered just as integral to the Freetown ethics as the entrepreneurs. For this reason many Danes have seen Christiania as a successful social experiment. However, for years the legal status of the region has been in a limbo due to different Danish governments attempting to remove the Christianites. Such attempts at removal have all been unsuccessful so far.

Christiania is considered to be the fourth largest [[tourist attraction]] in Copenhagen (and it has half a million visitors annually);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/2013/12/25/tema/reise/ferie/europaferie/europa/30909554/ En rusten plattform og et kuleformet hus mener de er egne stater - Disse ni europeiske landene eksisterer egentlig ikke.]&lt;/ref&gt; and abroad it is a well-known "brand" for the supposedly progressive and liberated Danish lifestyle. Many Danish businesses and organizations also use Christiania as a show place for their foreign friends and guests.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The purpose is to show something Danish that cannot be found anywhere else in the world.

The people in Christiania have developed their own set of rules, independent of the Danish government. The rules forbid stealing, violence, guns, knives, bulletproof vests, hard drugs and [[Colors (motorcycling)|bikers' colors]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://milepoint.com/forums/threads/guide-to-the-alternative-copenhagen.2246/ Guide to The Alternative Copenhagen]&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published source|date=July 2015}}

Famous for its main drag, known as ''Pusher Street'', where [[hashish|hash]] and [[Skunk (cannabis)|skunk weed]] is sold openly from permanent stands, it nevertheless does have rules forbidding 'hard drugs', such as [[cocaine]], [[amphetamine]], [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]] and [[heroin]]. The hash commerce is controversial, but since the rules require a consensus they cannot be removed unless everybody agrees. Legalization of cannabis is one of the ideas of many of the citizens in Christiania. The region negotiated an arrangement with the Danish defense ministry (which still owns the land) in 1995. Since 1994, residents have paid taxes and fees for water, electricity, trash disposal, etc.

After bitter negotiations that temporarily resulted in the area being sealed off to the public, in June 2011, the residents of Christiania agreed to collectively set up a fund to formally purchase the land at below market prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/51799-update-christiania-accepts-beautiful-agreement.html |title=UPDATE: Christiania accepts "beautiful agreement" |accessdate=2011-07-12 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130035107/http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/51799-update-christiania-accepts-beautiful-agreement.html |archivedate=November 30, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The community made its first payment in July 2012, officially becoming legal landowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/in-copenhagens-christiania-neighborhood-the-future-looks-more-settled/2012/09/06/cb1df946-ed38-11e1-a80b-9f898562d010_story.html |work=The Washington Post |title=In Copenhagen's Christiania neighborhood, the future looks more settled|author=Vickers, Steve|date=September 7, 2012|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Riots over demolition of house ===
On 14 May 2007, workers from the governmental Forest and Nature Agency, accompanied by police, entered Christiania to demolish leftovers of the small, abandoned building of ''Cigarkassen'' ('the cigar box'). They were met by angry and frightened Christianites, fearing that the police also intended to demolish other houses. The residents built roadblocks, but the police eventually entered the Freetown en masse and were met by resistance. Residents threw stones and shot fireworks at police vehicles. They also built barricades in the street outside Christiania's gate. The police used [[tear gas]] on the residents and a number of arrests were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cphpost.dk/get/101685.html |title=Christiania demolition unleashes havoc |accessdate=2007-05-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921125748/http://www.cphpost.dk/get/101685.html |archivedate=September 21, 2008 |df= }} [[The Copenhagen Post]], 14 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; One activist sneaked behind the police commander and poured a bucket of urine and feces upon him before being immediately arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jp.dk/kbh/artikel%3Aaid%3D4407920/ |title=Politichef overhældt med urin af aktivist |accessdate=2017-09-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518182454/http://www.jp.dk/kbh/artikel%3Aaid%3D4407920/ |archivedate=May 18, 2007 |df= }} [[Jyllands-Posten]], 14 May 2007 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trouble continued into the early morning hours.

=== 2005 shooting and murder ===
On 24 April 2005, a 26-year-old Christiania resident was killed and three other residents injured in a violent gang assault on ''Pusher Street''. The reason for this was a feud over the cannabis market of Copenhagen.

After the open cannabis trade was ended in Christiania the year before, criminal circles outside Christiania were eager to take over the market. Those responsible for the shooting were one such gang residing in [[Nørrebro]], a northwestern borough of the city. They had repeatedly asked the Christiania pushers to allow them on their market and had repeatedly been turned down. On 23 April 2005, this stalemate escalated violently. The pushers of Christiania discovered that a member of the outside gang had infiltrated their organisation by dating a female pusher. He was exposed and just barely escaped; two shots were fired at him. The next day two cars pulled up outside Christiania and 6–8 masked men with [[automatic weapon]]s got out and headed for ''Pusher Street''. When they arrived they fired at least 35 rounds indiscriminately toward the crowd, killing one Christianite and injuring three others.

Some saw this tragic incident as a sign that the future survival of the community was dubious due to the risk of violence stemming from the cannabis market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cphpost.dk/get/87615.html |title=First arrest in drug war slaying |accessdate=2006-08-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927182157/http://www.cphpost.dk/get/87615.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others blamed the incident on the fragmentation of the Copenhagen cannabis market and its expansion to the rest of the city, brought about by the measures of the [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] government.

=== Cars ===
Within Christiania itself no private cars are allowed. However, a total of 132 cars are owned by residents and need to be parked on the streets surrounding the Freetown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.christiania.org/~hannah/33/polilogn/01folder.htm |title=SVAR PÅ: "200 BILER" |accessdate=2006-08-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928083830/http://home.christiania.org/~hannah/33/polilogn/01folder.htm#svar5 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}{{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After negotiating with city authorities, Christiania has agreed to establish parking areas for residents' own cars on its territory. As of 2005, parking space for only 14 cars had been established within the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://christiania.org/~trafikgruppe/ |title=Christiania´s TRAFIKGRUPPE |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030203052222/http://christiania.org/~trafikgruppe/ |archivedate=February 3, 2003 |df= }}{{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the city council elections of November 2001, residents in one of Christiania's sections proposed a municipal kindergarten just outside Christiania should be torn down and moved some hundred meters away, the area being turned into a parking lot. The proposal was criticized by other Christiania residents and citizens in the borough, but proponents claimed the wooden kindergarten buildings were outdated anyway and the parking space issue needed to be solved before Christiania itself would turn into an area where cars were widely parked. It has also been claimed that taxis and police vehicles add to the traffic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ch1.dk/arkiv/nyh/uge_spejl_18_01_02.htm |title=Fra Ugespejlet 11 - OM:TREKANTEN.

As of 2008 Christiania established a road block robot in the vehicle entrance of Christiania next to The Gray Hall (Grå Hal) to prevent cannabis customers and other visitors from driving into Christiania and parking their cars in its narrow streets. Only cargo transport is allowed through these gates. A downside to this was that it moved the problem to another part of Christiania further up the road where the residents now have blocked this entrance entirely until another road block robot will be installed. There are very few entrances to Christiania. With the two entrances blocked by road block robots the Christianites believe they can rid themselves from the problem of harassing traffic.

=== Gay House ===
Since the 1970s, the Gay House (Bøssehuset), one of Christiania's autonomous institutions, had been a center for gay activism, parties, and theatre. The humorous and artistically high-ranking variety-style shows still have fame among Copenhagen homosexuals. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In 2002, a group of young gay performers and activists, [[Dunst (queer network in Copenhagen)|Dunst]], were invited to take over the house so it could remain a center for gay activity. Dunst introduced democratic management and established open workshops for photography, art, music, dance, video etc. They also arranged three 'Save Christiania' nights, a cabaret show and three support parties in order to be able to pay down some of the Gay House's debt to Christiania. According to Dunst, however, neighbours would never readily accept them and the newcomers were accused of not understanding "the Christiania lifestyle". Dunst claimed they received verbal abuse, threatening letters, and even in one instance, had a baseball bat brandished against them. Some disliked Dunst's loud parties and their contemporary electro-punk style music being described as [[techno]]. After nine months, they were asked to leave Christiania.

In 2004, Dunst participated in 'Christiania Distortion', an event supportive of Christiania. As they could not make use of the Gay House, Dunst's part of the event took place in a bus circling around Christiania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunst.dk/dunst/about_us/dk_hvad_er_dunst.html |title=Dunst historie |publisher=Dunst.dk |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2012|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunst.dk/dunst/press/2004/04_05_26_ugespeglet/ugespeglet.html |title=Åbent brev til Christiania |publisher=Dunst.dk |date=26 May 2004 |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drugs ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
[[File:Christiania Street (cropped).JPG|thumb|''Pusher Street'' in 2007, after eviction of the hash stands. A 'no photo sign' remains.]]
Since its opening, Christiania has been famous for its open cannabis trade, taking place in the aptly named and centrally located ''Pusher Street'', although named ''Green Light District'' by the Christianian council. Although the hash trade is illegal, authorities were for many years reluctant to forcibly stop it. Proponents thought that concentrating the hash trade at one place would limit its dispersion in society, and that it could prevent users from switching to 'harder drugs'. Some wanted to legalize hash altogether. Opponents thought the ban should be enforced, in Christiania as elsewhere, and that there should be no differentiation between 'soft' and 'hard' drugs. It has also been claimed that the open cannabis trade was one of Copenhagen's major tourist attractions, while some said it scared other potential tourists away. Even though the police have attempted to stop the drug trade, the cannabis market has generally thrived in Christiania. Following the [[Freetown Christiania#2016 shooting|2016 shooting]] where local residents removed the ''Pusher Street'' stalls, it was estimated that the cannabis sale dropped by about 75%.&lt;ref name="pol30oct"/&gt;

=== Eviction of 'hard drugs' ===
[[File:Mural in Christiania against hard drugs.jpg|thumb|right|Murals and signs around Christiania make the community's opposition to heroin clear.]]
During the late 1970s 'hard drugs' such as [[heroin]] were considered permissible, but this had grave consequences. In one year, from 1978 to 1979, ten people had died in Christiania from drug overdose; four of them were residents. Most of them lived in a building called 'The Arc of Peace', which was in an extreme level of disrepair: doors were missing, there were holes in the floors and, in most rooms, there was no furniture except for mattresses. One floor was overrun by a feral cat colony.

Heroin-pushers were eventually evicted by the residents, and the "ban" on hard drugs continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christiania.org/info/christiania-guide/|title=Christiania.org -   Christiania Guide|website=www.christiania.org|language=da-DK|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biker gang eviction ===
Around 1984 a Copenhagen-resident biker gang called Bullshit arrived in Christiania and took control of a part of the cannabis market. Violence in the neighborhood increased and many Christianites felt unsafe and unhappy with the new residents. This resulted in sabotage acts directed towards the bikers as well as the publication of several provocative manuscripts urging the Christianites to throw out the powerful and armed bikers. This tension culminated when the police found a murdered individual who had been sliced to pieces and buried beneath the floor of a building. Christiania reacted with two colossal community meetings—one outside the building—where it was agreed that the bikers had to leave.

The [[Hells Angels]] recently had established themselves in Copenhagen and the leaders of Bullshit were murdered in a war over the drug trade in Copenhagen including Christiania.

A biker war between the Hells Angels and rival gangs over the drug trade continued in Copenhagen until 1996 from the murder of the leader of Bullshit, 'Makrellen', who controlled the cannabis trade in Christiania.

=== Action against open drug selling ===
Since its opening in 1971, the open drug trade of Christiania was a thorn in the side of Danish authorities, a constant source of public discussion, and led to protests from neighboring countries as well (especially [[Drug policy of Sweden|Sweden with its no-tolerance drug policy]]). When the centre-right [[Cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen I|cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] took office in 2001, one of its promises was to end illegal activities at Christiania. These were, including the obvious cannabis market, a long list of alleged criminal activities. People demanded the end of 'hard drugs' sales, such as cocaine and amphetamines, weapons trade, dealing with contraband etc. The Christiania residents claimed them to be purely speculative accusations.

In 2002, the government began aiming to make the cannabis trade less visible. In response, the cannabis sellers covered their stands in military [[camouflage]] nets as a humorous reply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christiania.org/inc/guide/?lan=gb&amp;side=10 |title=Christiania Guide - Page 10 - www.christiania.org |accessdate=2007-06-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205193855/http://www.christiania.org/inc/guide/?lan=gb&amp;side=10 |archivedate=February 5, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January 2004, the stands were demolished by the cannabis dealers the day before a large scale police operation. They knew about this operation, and decided to take the stands down themselves. The police made more than 20 arrests in the following weeks, and a large part of the organized dealer network of ''Pusher Street'' was then eliminated. Before they were demolished, the [[National Museum of Denmark]] was able to get one of the more colorful stands, which is now part of an exhibit.

On 16 March 2004, police raided the area. Allegedly, many dealers started to move huge amounts of cannabis out into Copenhagen and the rest of the country instead. This was done in order to avoid the heavy police-presence in Christiania and to meet the demand for cannabis by clients.

The open cannabis trade returned to ''Pusher Street'' after the 2004 raids, but the stalls were again torn down by Christiania's residents after the [[Freetown Christiania#2016 shooting|2016 shooting]].&lt;ref name="BBC-2016-09-02"/&gt; The hiatus on the open cannabis trade was short-lived; by May 2017, the stalls on Pusher Street were restored.

== Further developments ==
The open cannabis trade in Christiania has been hailed by some [[Danes]] and condemned by others. The [[Centre-right politics|center-right]] government took a number of steps to enforce the law in Christiania. The first step in this process was a police crackdown on the cannabis trade. Both politicians and police declared that the cannabis trade would not be allowed to return. The second (and currently ongoing) phase is the registration of all buildings in Christiania. The third step will be the demolition of a number of wooden private residences situated in a nature conservation area (the historic naval fortress of Copenhagen). These buildings had all been approved by the authorities before the new government passed the current law on Christiania.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}  For the last 15 years the government has not allowed construction in Christiania.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} This is now being enforced on a zero-tolerance policy with the help of a massive police presence.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Governmental normalization measures ===
In 2004, the Danish government passed a law abolishing the collective and treating its 900 members as individuals. Beginning in the summer of 2005, a series of protests were staged by Christiania members. During the same time, Danish police made frequent sweeps of the area.

The Christiania Café ''Månefiskeren'' set up a board recording the number of police patrols on Christiania in November 2005. In the summer of 2006 this passed the 1,000th patrol (about 4–6 patrols a day). These patrols normally consisted of 6 to 20 police officers, often dressed in combat uniform and sometimes with police dogs.

In January 2006, the government proposed that Christiania would be turned into a mixed alternative community and residential area adding [[condominium]]s for 400 new residents. Current residents, now paying [[Danish krone|DKK]] 1,450 (USD 250) per month, would be allowed to remain but need to begin paying normal rent for the facilities, albeit below market rent levels. Christiania has rejected this scenario, fearing the freetown would turn into a normal Copenhagen neighborhood. In particular, the concept of privately owned dwellings is claimed to be incompatible with Christiania's collective ownership.

In September 2007, the representatives of Christiania and Copenhagen's city council reached an agreement to cede control of Christiania to the city over the course of 10 years for the purposes of business development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/18/farewelltofreetown | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Farewell to Freetown | date=2007-09-18 | accessdate=2010-05-02 | first=Harriet | last=Riley}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, as of May 2009, the [[Courts of Denmark|Eastern High Court]] upheld a 2004 Act of Parliament which reaffirmed the state's legal claim to control of the base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/45750-christiania-loses-court-challenge.html |title=Christiania loses court challenge |accessdate=2010-01-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811224214/http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/45750-christiania-loses-court-challenge.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule is confirmed in February 2011 by the Supreme Court. The state has now full right of disposal of the Christiania area. On June 2011, the State signs the agreement with Christiania that the Christiania area will be transferred to a new foundation, the Foundation Freetown [https://www.bygst.dk/english/knowledge/christiania/the-negotiations-between-christiania-and-the-state/?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 Christiania]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bygst.dk/english/knowledge/christiania/the-negotiations-between-christiania-and-the-state/?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1|title=The negotiations between Christiania and the state  {{!}} Bygningsstyrelsen|website=www.bygst.dk|language=da|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The most contentious part of this process has been to force the residents — naturally opposed to the whole idea of ownership — to buy the piece of land they’ve been occupying for more than 40 years. In July 2012, they made the first payment, and the Christianites went from squatters to legal landowners. A foundation, run by residents, was set up to raise funds and apply for a bank loan.

On July 2013, the legislative proposal L 179 for the repealing of the Christiania Law is adopted by all parties in the Danish Parliament with the exception of the Danish People's Party.

=== Quotes from politicians ===
{{quote|Christiania is a dwelling for people who wish to live in a different manner ... But it is crucial that varied ownership-models are introduced, so that there will be both private and partially owned houses.|Christian Wedell-Neergaard, the Christiania-spokesperson for the governing [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative Party]] {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}}}

{{quote|(Christiania's) demand that there be a collective fund is not fair, It doesn't meet the wish for a normalization. We (the government) have emphasized that there should be varied ownership-models, such as private ownership ... it is natural that there are also privately owned buildings in an area like Christiania ... Because it is the case for the surrounding society in general, that there are variety in the ownership.|Christian Wedell-Neergaard&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from Politiken, 29 January 2006, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|It's a question of principle, whether a group of people should be allowed to occupy a large part of government property in central Copenhagen. There's no question that what they've been doing is illegal ... they seized government property and have been living on it and that's worth a lot of money now.|Karsten Lauritzen, Member of Parliament from Danish party Venstre&lt;ref&gt;[http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2012/christiania-for-sale/ "Christiania for Sale"], ''Roads &amp; Kingdoms'', June 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Minister of Finance from the Liberal Party (Venstre), part of the then ruling coalition, who to the question in parliament whether the new buildings at Christiania were only economically motivated, answered:

{{quote|It is a political priority that there be built new houses as suggested, to ensure a development of the Christiania-area with varied ownership-models.|[[Thor Pedersen]] (Finance Minister and member of the Danish Liberal party [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]])&lt;ref&gt;Information, 6 June 2006, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Architectural competition ===
In order to present a reasonable use of area after an eventual "cleaning", the Danish government commissioned an architectural competition. 17 proposals were received, of which only eight have met the formal competition requirements. All of the proposals were rejected by the jury. The cost of the architectural competition was 850,000 [[Danish krone]]r.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

=== Christiania's development plan ===
Christiania has countered the government's plans for normalization with its own community driven planning proposal, which after eight months of internal workshops and meetings gained consensus at the common meeting before being published in early 2006.
Christiania's own development plan was awarded the Initiative Award of the Society for the Beautification of Copenhagen in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pris til Christiania|url=https://www.information.dk/2007/07/pris-christiania|website=Information.dk|accessdate=17 October 2017|language=da-DK|date=25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan has received positive attention from the municipality of Copenhagen and the Agenda 21 Society for its sustainability goals and democratic process.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

'''Functionalism''' is a [[International relations theory|theory of international relations]] that arose during the inter-War period principally from the strong concern about the obsolescence of the State as a form of social organization. Rather than the self-interest of [[nation-states]] that [[Realism in international relations|realists]] see as a motivating factor, functionalists focus on common interests and needs shared by states (but also by non-state actors) in a process of global integration triggered by the erosion of state sovereignty and the increasing weight of knowledge and hence of scientists and experts in the process of policy-making (Rosamond, 2000).  Its roots can be traced back to the liberal/idealist tradition that started with [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and goes as far as [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s "[[Fourteen Points]]" speech (Rosamond, 2000).

Functionalism is a pioneer in globalisation theory and strategy. States had built authority structures upon a principle of territorialism. State-theories were built upon assumptions that identified the scope of authority with territory (Held 1996, Scholte: 1993, 2000, 2001), aided by methodological territorialism (Scholte 1993). Functionalism proposed to build a form of authority based in functions and needs, which linked authority with needs, scientific knowledge, expertise and technology, i.e. it provided a supraterritorial concept of authority. The functionalist approach excludes and refutes the idea of state power and political influence (realist approach) in interpreting the cause for such proliferation of international organizations during the inter-war (which was characterized by nation-state conflict) and the subsequent years.{{ref|mck6}}

According to functionalism, international [[Regional integration|integration]] – the collective governance and 'material interdependence' (Mitrany, 1933:101) between states – develops its own internal dynamic as states integrate in limited functional, technical, and/or economic areas. International agencies would meet human needs, aided by knowledge and expertise. The benefits rendered by the functional agencies would attract the loyalty of the populations and stimulate their participation and expand the area of integration. There are strong assumptions underpinning functionalism: 1) That the process of integration takes place within a framework of human freedom, 2) That knowledge and expertise are currently available to meet the needs for which the functional agencies are built. 3) That states will not sabotage the process.

== Neofunctionalism ==
{{Main|Neofunctionalism}}
Neofunctionalism reintroduced territorialism in the functional theory and downplayed its global dimension. Neofunctionalism is simultaneously a theory and a strategy of [[regional integration]], building on the work of [[David Mitrany]]. Neofunctionalists focused their attention solely on the immediate process of integration among states, i.e. regional integration. Initially, states integrate in limited functional or economic areas. Thereafter, partially integrated states experience increasing momentum for further rounds of integration in related areas. This "[[invisible hand]]" of integration phenomenon was termed "spill-over." by the neofunctionalist school. This was most apparent in the study of euthanasia. Although integration can be resisted, it becomes harder to stop integration's reach as it progresses.{{ref|mck1}}

According to neofunctionalists, there are two kinds of spillover: functional and political.  [[Knowledge spillover|Functional spillover]] is the interconnection of various ''economic'' sectors or issue-areas, and the integration in one policy-area spilling over into others. Political spillover is the creation of supranational governance models, as far-reaching as the [[European Union]], or as voluntary as the [[United Nations]].

One of its protagonists was [[Ernst B. Haas]], a US political scientist. [[Jean Monnet]]'s approach to European integration, which aimed at integrating individual sectors in hopes of achieving spill-over effects to further the process of integration, is said to have followed the neofunctional school's tack. Unlike previous theories of integration, neofunctionalism declared to be non-normative and tried to describe and explain the process of regional integration based on empirical data. Integration was regarded as an inevitable process, rather than a desirable state of affairs that could be introduced by the political or technocratic elites of the involved states' societies. Its strength however was also its weakness: While it understood that regional integration is only feasible as an incremental process, its conception of integration as a linear process made the explanation of setbacks impossible.

== Comparing Functionalism to Realism ==

&lt;/center&gt;

== Functional Cooperation and Functional International Organization ==
The objective of functionalism towards global peace is achieved through functional cooperation by the work of [[international organization]]s (including intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations). The activities of functional international organizations involve taking actions on practical and technical problems rather than those of military and political nature. They are also non-controversial politically and involve a common interest to solve international problems that could best be tackled in a [[Transnationality|transnational]] manner.{{ref|mck6}} According to [[David Mitrany]], dealing with functional matters provides the actors in the international community the opportunity to successfully cooperate in a non-political context, which might otherwise be harder to achieve in a political context. Further development would lead to a process called “autonomous development” towards multiplication, expansion, and deepening of functional international organizations.{{ref|mck3}}{{ref|mck6}} Ideally, this would ultimately result in an [[Global governance|international government]].{{ref|mck4}}{{ref|mck6}} Functionalists in this manner assume that cooperation in a non-political context would bring [[World peace|international peace]].{{ref|mck5}} Eradication of existent non-political, non-military global problems, which Functionalists consider to be the very origin of conflict within the global community, is what they aim to pursue.{{ref|mck6}} However, critics point out some limitations of functionalist assumption: 1. In practice, dealing with functional matters does not nessarily and always facilitate cooperation. 2. Its simplified assumption overlooks different causes of state conflict.{{ref|mck6}}

The proliferation of functional international organizations has occurred without adequate reorganization and coordination efforts due to a lack of central [[global governance]] to ensure [[accountability]] of such organizations.{{ref|mck7}} As a result, a pattern of [[decentralization]] could be observed among functional international organizations to the present day.{{ref|mck8}} For example, the [[League of Nations]]’ effort to coordinate functional international organizations in the field of social and economic cooperation through establishment of [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|UN Economic and Social Council]] has been futile.{{ref|mck9}} As a result, the idea of decentralization prevails to the present day except in cases of special cooperative relationships between Economic and Social Council and some functional organizations.{{ref|mck10}} Subsequently, summits such as the World Summit for Social Development in 1995, The Millennium Summit in 2000 and World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 were held to address and coordinate functional cooperation, especially regarding the social and economic aspects.{{ref|mck11}}

Substantive functions of functional international organizations include human rights, international communication, health, the law of the sea, the environment, education and information, international relief programs, refugee support, and economic development.{{ref|mck12}}

The term '''gaps and gores''' refers to portions of land areas that do not conform to boundaries found in [[Cadastre|land survey]]s based upon imprecise measurements and other ambiguities of [[metes and bounds]].  A gap, also known as a [[Wikt:hiatus|hiatus]], occurs where the descriptions in deeds describing adjacent properties (unintentionally) overlook a space or "gap" between them.  A [[gore (surveying)|gore]] occurs where descriptions in larger administrative boundaries (towns, counties) of adjacent jurisdictions or, large parcels, all fail to include some portion of land between them, forming an unclaimed, triangular "sliver" of land.  

Disputes often arise regarding the ownership of gaps and gores when they are discovered, usually when developers detect sufficient value in the local land. Local laws will determine whether they are considered abandoned or rather adhere to (or may be absorbed by) one adjacent parcel or another.  For example, in [[Tennessee]] law, [[tax map]] boundaries can become property boundaries (notwithstanding a survey and deed to the contrary) merely by paying the taxes on the land for twenty years in the belief that it was part of the ownership, even if it encompasses adjacent gaps and gores. ''See'' [[adverse possession]].

{{Elections}}
A '''general election''' is an [[election]] in which all or most members of a given political body are chosen. These are usually held for a nation's primary legislative body, as distinguished from [[by-election]]s and [[local election]]s.

In [[Presidential system|presidential systems]], a general election is a [[fixed-term election|regularly scheduled]] election where both the president, and either "[[Staggered elections|a class]]" of or all members of the national legislature are elected at the same time but can also involve special elections held to fill prematurely vacated positions. A general election day may also include elections for local officials.

The term originates in the [[elections in the United Kingdom]] for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] started on November 26 1962.

==India ==
{{main|Elections in India}}
The elections held to elect the members of the Lok Sabha after expiry of the Parliamentary Elections. Earlier up to 1957 simultaneous elections were held for both the Lok Sabha and the State Assemblies. However, on account of early dismissal and mid-term elections the two got separated.

==United Kingdom==
{{see also|Elections in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom general elections overview}}
The term ''general election'' in the United Kingdom often refers to the elections held on the same day in all constituencies of their [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Under the terms of the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], the period between one general election and the next is fixed at 5 years, unless the House of Commons passes
* a motion of no confidence in the Government sooner than that, and does not pass a motion of confidence in a new Government within 14 days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14#section-2-3|title=Fixed-term Parliaments Act Section 2(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or;
* a motion, approved by two-thirds of its members, resolving that a general election should take place sooner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14#section-2-1|title=Fixed-term Parliaments Act Section 2(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or;
* a [[Statutory instrument (UK)|proposal]] from the Prime Minister to reschedule an election mandated by the Act to no later than two months after the original date&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14#section-1-5|title=Fixed-term Parliaments Act Section 1(5)}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The term may also be used to refer to elections to any democratically elected body in which all of the members are up for election. Section 2 of the Scotland Act 1998, for example, specifically refers to ordinary elections to the Scottish Parliament as general elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980046_en_2#pt1-pb2-l1g2|title=Scotland Act 1998|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, British elections took place over a period of several weeks, with individual constituencies holding polling on separate days. The [[Parliament Act 1911]] introduced the requirement that elections in all parliamentary constituencies be held on the same day. There has been a convention since the 1930s that general elections in Britain should take place on a Thursday; the last general election to take place on any other weekday was that of [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931]].

The five-year limit on the time of a Parliament can be varied by an Act of Parliament implemented by several bodies. This was done during both World Wars; the Parliament elected in [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910]] was prolonged to November 1918, and that elected in [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|November 1935]] lasted until June 1945. The [[House of Lords]] has an absolute veto on any Bill to extend the life of Parliament.

==United States ==
{{Main|Elections in the United States}}

In U.S. politics, general elections are elections held at any level (e.g. city, county, congressional district, state) that typically involve competition between at least two parties.  General elections occur every two to six years (depending on the positions being filled with most positions good for four years) and include the presidential election, but unlike parliamentary systems the term can also refer to special elections that fill out positions prematurely vacated by the previous office holder (e.g. through death, resignation, etc.). Some parallels can be drawn between the general election in parliamentary systems and the biennial [[United States House of Representatives#Elections|elections determining all House seats]], although there is no analogue to "calling early elections" in the U.S., and the members of the elected [[U.S. Senate]] face elections of only one-third at a time at two-year intervals including during a general election.&lt;!-- citation needed --&gt;

Unlike parliamentary systems where the term ''general election'' is distinguished from by-elections or local and regional elections, the term is used in the US in reference to and distinguished from primaries or caucuses, which are intra-party elections meant to select a party's official candidate for a particular race.

In the [[Louisiana#politics|State of Louisiana]] the expression ''general election'' means the [[runoff election]] which occurs between the two highest candidates as determined by the [[jungle primary]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5 of the [http://www.lawserver.com/law/state/louisiana/la-laws/louisiana_revised_statutes_18-401 ''Louisiana Election Code''], incorporating Section 18:401 of the ''Louisiana Revised Statutes''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heroic realism''' is art used as [[propaganda]]. Examples include the [[Socialist realism]] style associated with [[Communist]] regimes, and sometimes [[Art of the Third Reich|the similar art style]] associated with [[Fascism]].  Its characteristics are [[realism (arts)|realism]] and the depiction of figures as ideal types or symbols, often with explicit rejection of [[modern art|modernism]] in art (as "[[bourgeois]]" or "[[Degenerate Art|degenerate]]").

==Purposes==
Both socialist art and Nazi art were explicitly ordered to be heroic,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p.&amp;nbsp;355 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were in consequence ideal rather than realistic.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p.&amp;nbsp;356 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heroic realism designs were used to propagate the revolution in the Soviet Union during [[Lenin]]'s time. Lenin doubted that the illiterate population would understand what abstract visual images were intended to communicate. He also thought that artists, such as [[Constructivism (art)|constructivists]] and [[Productivism (art)|productivists]], may have had a hidden agenda against the government.  Movements such as [[Cubism]] were denounced as bourgeois and criticized for its failure to draw on the heritage of art and for rejecting the beautiful on the grounds that it was "old",&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Sopontsinsky, ''Art in the Soviet Union: Painting, Sculpture, Graphic Arts'', p.&amp;nbsp;6 Aurora Art Publishers, Leningrad, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[proletarian culture]] had to draw on what was learned in the prior times.  The artists countered such thinking, however, by saying that the advanced art represented the advanced political ideas.

In literature, [[Maxim Gorky]] urged that one obtained realism by extracting the basic idea from reality, but by adding the potential and desirable to it, one added romantism with deep revolutionary potential.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Stacy, ''Russian Literary Criticism'' p.&amp;nbsp;188 {{ISBN|0-8156-0108-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
[[File:1988 CPA 6017.jpg|thumb|300px|''Worker and Kolkhoz Woman'']]
[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] understood the powerful message which could be sent through images to a primarily illiterate population. Once he was in power, posters quickly became the new medium for educating illiterate peasants on daily life—from bathing, to farming, the posters provided visual instruction on almost everything.  In 1931-2, the early emphasis on the "little man" and the anonymous laboring masses gave way to the "hero of labor", derived from the people but set apart by the scale of his deeds.&lt;ref name="overy259"&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p.&amp;nbsp;259 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence, literature filled with "positive heroes" that were sometimes tedious.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Stacy, ''Russian Literary Criticism'' p.&amp;nbsp;224 {{ISBN|0-8156-0108-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, a new doctrine called [[Socialist realism]] came about. This new movement rejected the "bourgeois influence on art" and replaced it with appreciation for figurative painting, photography and new typography layouts.  Writers were explicitly enjoined to develop "heroization."&lt;ref name="overy259"/&gt;  At the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris World Fair]], [[Vera Mukhina]]'s ''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'' exemplified the ideal [[New Soviet Man]], depicting a man and woman in working clothes, with his hammer and her sickle crossed, in a monumental statue with both striding forward.&lt;ref name="overy260"/&gt;

When [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in Germany in 1933, [[modern art]] was condemned as [[Degenerate art|degenerate]], and largely prohibited. The [[Nazi]]s promoted a style of art based on classical models, intended to nurture nationalism.  Heroic realism was to inculcate values of sacrifice, duty, and devotion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Marcuse]], ''Negations'', p.&amp;nbsp;29-30 Beacon Press, Boston 1968&lt;/ref&gt;  The heroic man, who was bound to [[blood and soil]], acted rather than thought and sacrificed himself.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, ''Negations'', p.&amp;nbsp;2 Beacon Press, Boston 1968&lt;/ref&gt;  This particularly favored the heroic death.&lt;ref&gt;eye magazine: [http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=62&amp;fid=270 Designing heroes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi theory explicitly rejected "materialism", and therefore, despite the realistic treatment of images, "realism" was a seldom used term.&lt;ref name="Adam138"&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;138 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A painter was to create an ideal picture, for eternity.&lt;ref name="Adam138" /&gt; The images of men, and still more of women, were heavily stereotyped,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;150 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; with physical perfection required for the nude paintings.&lt;ref name="sontag3"&gt;[[Susan Sontag]],"[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1975/feb/06/fascinating-fascism/?page=3 Fascinating Fascism]"&lt;/ref&gt;  In painting, peasants were popular images, reflecting a simple life in harmony with nature.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;132 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sculpture's monumental possibilities gave it a better expression of Nazi racial theories.&lt;ref name="Adam177"&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;177 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common image was of the nude male, expressing the ideal of the Aryan race.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;178 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arno Breker]]'s skill at this type made him Hitler's favorite sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=602 Caroline Fetscher, "Why Mention Arno Breker Today?", ''The Atlantic Times'', August, 2006.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211083704/http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=602 |date=2012-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nude females were also common, though they tended to be less monumental.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;188 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In both cases, the physical form was to show no imperfections.&lt;ref name="sontag3"/&gt;  At the [[Paris Exposition of 1937]], [[Josef Thorak]]'s ''Comradeship'' stood outside the German pavilion, depicting two enormous nude males, clasping hands and standing defiantly side by side, in a pose of defense and racial camaraderie.&lt;ref name="overy260"&gt;[[Richard Overy]], ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p.&amp;nbsp;260 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Indo-Tibetan Border Police. Sarahan.jpg|thumb|Indo-Tibetan Border Police. [[Sarahan]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], India.]]
The '''Indo-Tibetan Border Police''' ('''ITBP''') is one of the five [[Central Armed Police Forces]] of [[India]], raised on 24 October 1962, under the CRPF Act, in the wake of the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962. The ITBP was intended for deployment along India's border with China's [[Tibet Autonomous Region]].

In September 1996, the Parliament of India enacted the "Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force Act, 1992"  to "provide for the constitution and regulation" of the ITBP "for ensuring the security of the borders of India and for matters connected therewith".&lt;ref name="ITBP act"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE INDO-TIBETAN BORDER POLICE FORCE ACT, 1992 ACT No. 35 OF 1992|url=http://itbpolice.nic.in/itbpwebsite/Documents/ITBP-Act.pdf|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=29 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029033512/http://itbpolice.nic.in/itbpwebsite/Documents/ITBP-Act.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Histort, ItBP"&gt;{{cite web|title=HISTORY AND ROLE OF ITBP|url=http://itbpolice.nic.in/itbpwebsite/mar.html|website=ITBP|publisher=ITBP|accessdate=29 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415040154/http://itbpolice.nic.in/itbpwebsite/mar.html|archivedate=15 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first head of the ITBP,  designated Inspector General, was Balbir Singh, a police officer previously belonging to the Intelligence Bureau. The ITBP, which started with 4 battalions, has since restructuring in 1978 has undergone expansion to a force of 56 battalions as of 2017 with a sanctioned strength of 89,432.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/EnglAnnualReport2016-17_17042017.pdf|title=MHA Annual Report 2016-2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808200948/http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/EnglAnnualReport2016-17_17042017.pdf|archivedate=8 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ITBP is trained in Civil Medical Camp, [[disaster management]], and [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|nuclear]], biological and chemical disasters. ITBP personnel have been deployed abroad in UN peacekeeping missions in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Haiti, Western Sahara, Sudan, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Two battalions of ITBP are deputed to [[National Disaster Response Force]].

== Command Control superstructure ==
ITBP, for the first two decades since its raising in 1962, till 1983, was headed by Inspector Generals of Police (IGs), all drawn from the IPS. In this period (1963–83), IGs had stable tenures, for instance B Chatterjee, IG, was head of the force from 02-06-1964 to 31-08-1974, and R N Sheopory, as IG, was head from 03-09-1974 to 22-12-1980. In 1983, the [[Indira Gandhi]] led Congress Government, upgraded ITBP head to Director General (DG). Since  then, there has exponentially expansion of higher ranks, accompanied by volatility in the tenures of the head of ITBP. Instead of one IG as in 1983, ITBP now has 16 DG/IGs, and over 40 DIGs. The average tenure of DGs is about a year plus, and in some cases barely a few weeks, for instance B.B. Nandy, IPS, was DG (10-01-1997 to 03-04-1997), for just 28 weeks. Going by the trend of short tenures of DGs, it would appear that the Government is not overly concerned about command control, or in maintaining command continuity in the ITBP.&lt;ref name="official Force, MHA, GOI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MHA|title=official website of Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force, MHA, GOI|url=http://itbpolice.nic.in/itbpwebsite/index.html|website=|publisher=MHA|accessdate=26 January 2016|language=|date=2016|quote=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129224547/http://itbpolice.nic.in/itbpwebsite/index.html|archivedate=29 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post of DG was again upgraded by the [[Manmohan Singh]] led [[United Progressive Alliance|UPA]] Government in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://persmin.gov.in/DOPT/Acts_Rules/AIS_Rules/Revised_AIS_Rules_Vol_III_Updated_Upto_31Oct2011/Revised_AIS_Rule_Vol_III_IPS_Rule_08.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308035404/http://persmin.gov.in/DOPT/Acts_Rules/AIS_Rules/Revised_AIS_Rules_Vol_III_Updated_Upto_31Oct2011/Revised_AIS_Rule_Vol_III_IPS_Rule_08.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 March 2014 |title=INDIAN POLICE SERVICE (PAY) RULES, 2007 |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Government Of India Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances &amp; ...

[[File:Ski Contingent of the ITBP during their 53rd Raising Day Parade, 2014.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Ski Contingent of the ITBP during their 53rd Raising Day Parade, 2014]]Presently, battalions of ITBP are deployed on border guard duties from [[Karakoram Pass]] in [[Ladakh]] to Diphu La in [[Arunachal Pradesh]], covering 3488&amp;nbsp;km of the [[India-China border]]. Manned border posts are at altitudes as high as {{convert|21000|ft}} in the western, middle &amp; eastern sector of the border. ITBP is a mountain trained force and most of the officers &amp; men are professionally trained mountaineers and skiers. The force is under an expansion plan in order to provide relief to its troops from constant deployment in high altitude areas under dynamic and professional leadership of Subhash Goswami, IPS.
* The border posts manned by ITBP are exposed to high velocity [[storms]], snow blizzards, avalanches, and landslides, besides the hazards of high altitude and extreme cold, where temperature dips up to minus 40-degree Celsius. ITBP conducts Long Range and Short Range patrols to keep an effective vigil on inaccessible and unmanned areas on the border.
* The ITBP has recently taken on a disaster management role. Being the first responder for natural Disaster in [[Himalayas]], ITBP was the first to establish 06 (now 08) Regional Response Centres in [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]] and [[Northeast India]] and carried out numerous rescue and relief operations in various disaster situations, which took place in our areas of responsibility as well as other parts of the country.  ITBP has already trained 1032 personnel in Disaster Management including 98 personnel in [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|Radiological]] and Chemical and Biological emergencies.
* ITBP has established a National Centre for Training in Search, Rescue &amp; Disaster response at Bhanu, [[Haryana]] which is imparting training to personnel of ITBP and other Paramilitary / State Police Forces.  There is also a training centre for the Dogs at Basic Training centre situated at Bhanu.  The centre is known as NICD.
* ITBP Commando units provide security to the Embassy and consulates of India in [[Afghanistan]]. Besides this two Companies of the ITBP are providing security in Afghanistan.
* One company of ITBP is deployed in United Nation Mission in Congo since November, 2005. A National Centre for UNCIVPOL training has been set up at ITBP Camp, Tigri, [[Khanpur, Delhi]] for providing systematic training to Indian Police Officers for deployment in UN Mission.
* ITBP is also providing security to the pilgrims during Annual [[Kailash Manasarovar Yatra|Kailash Mansarovar Yatra]] from 1981. ITBP provides communication, security and medical cover to the yatries from Gunji to Lipulekh Pass and back to Gunji in co-ordination with MEA and Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam.

[[File:Chitkul village.JPG|thumb|right|Chitkul Village, as seen from the road to the ITBP checkpost]]

ITBP's major training centre is located at [[Mussoorie]], in [[Uttarakhand]]. The Training Academy has been established in 1976, and imparts training to Officers, Subordinate officers, and promotional course. Specialised training programmes in rock craft, explosives handling etc. are also conducted here.Ace mountaineer and [[Padma Shri]] awardee, [[Harbhajan Singh (mountaineer)|Harbhajan Singh]], IG heads this institution. Keeping in view the evolving security scenario of the country, ITBP has established a [[Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (India)|Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJW) at an altitude of 6000 feet in the heart of extremely tough Himalayan mountains, at Mahidanda in [[Uttarkashi]] district, under dynamic vision of the then DG of the Force Vikram Srivasatava, IPS. He provided top rated leadership to the force. The CIJW school provides state of the art training to ITBP's men and officers to enable them to take on the 21st century's security challenges in the form of anti Naxal Operations. Jungle warfare, handling of explosives, rock craft, survival in adverse conditions, unarmed combat, and guerrilla warfare are some of the subjects trained here.

The training regime, formulated under close supervision of Rajiv Mehta, IPS and executed on ground by Sanjeev Raina, DIG is extremely demanding both mentally and physically, needing special preparation.
The presence of the force along the Indo China border, maintains vigil along the extremely difficult high altitude border area. The troops of the force keeps a sharp eye on any violation of the border, trans border smuggling, and affords a sense of security to the remotely located isolated settlements. The altitude where the troops are deployed range up to 18800 feet, and the temperature plummets to minus 30 degrees during winter with snow fall of more than ten feet.

The force is synonymous with adventure and dare-devilry and has undertaken numerous mountaineering expeditions. Its skiers have been national champions, who have competed winter Olympics. Its river rafters have created international history in rafting through the turbulent white waters of the mighty Brahmaputra, the Indus and the Ganges.  The Force has created a milestone by becoming the first Central Para Military Force to grab up the Best Marching Contingent Trophy in the Republic Day parades in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2011. It broke new ground in 1998 when it sent the first ever police tableau of the country to participate in the Republic Day Parade.  ITBP is in the forefront of movement for the preservation of Himalayan [[Natural environment|environment]] and ecology.  ITBP has taken up in a big way the task of greening the Himalayan regions especially in Inner [[Himalayas]].  Being the only human presence in areas close to China border, it has taken on itself the task of maintaining the delicate balance of flora and fauna.

ITBP being deployed in mountains has developed the expertise in rescue &amp; relief operations in mountains, which entail different specialised skills of very high standard. It is always first in extending rescue &amp; relief in case of natural calamity. ITBP conducts a large number of civic action programmes in remote border and terrorist affected areas to provide free and expert medical, health and hygiene care to the civilian population in remote villages.

ITBP Academy has been given the status of "Centre of Excellence" by the Government of India and now is on the path of modernisation of its training infra- structure.  As of June 2004, the Academy has trained 3,785 GOs, 7,776 SOs and 27,476 Other Ranks from ITBP and CPOs/ State Police Forces.

== Training centres ==
ITBP training centres develop amongst the trainees the qualities of: professional skills, esprit de corps and leadership. They are taught the values of integrity, impartiality and respect for all castes, creeds and religions.
Maintaining the highest tradition of supreme sacrifice in the service of motherland the Himveers are also taught to function effectively while always keeping in mind human rights and the codes of war which always guide their conduct.

The Basic Training Centre at Bhanu, ITBP Academy at Mussourie, and the Mountaineering &amp; Skiing Institute at Auli run the training programmes and conduct indoor and outdoor training activities, in pursuance of this mission.

The motto of the ITBP, ''Shaurya, dridata, karm nishtha'' ''(Valour, determination, devotion to duty)'' has always inspired its men in accepting challenges to bring glory to the nation and honour to the force. In the course of active duties, the force has earned a number of Civil and Service honours, and decorations like Padma Shree – 2, Shaurya Chakra – 1, Sena Medal – 1, President's Police Medal for Gallantry – 3, Police Medal for Gallantry – 44, President's Police Medal for Distinguished Service – 63, Police Medal for Meritorious Service – 292 and the Prime Minister's Life Saving Medal – 54.

ITBP has undergone a massive expansion plan to provide much needed relief to its troops who remain deployed in the tough high altitude terrain for most part of their service. 13 units were raised in the year 2006–07, followed by another 7 units the following year.

ITBP is building full fledge recreation and Training centre in [[Belgaum]] at Halbhavi, [[Belgaum]] provides the best climate for recreation and ITBP will relocate the personal and will have large family bases in Belgaum for its soldiers after high altitude stressful.

== Education and Stress Counselling Services in ITBP ==
ITBP is the only Central Armed Police Force in India, which has combatised stress counsellors in its Field units, Formations Including the Ranks - Deputy Commandants ESC, Assistant Commandant-ESC, Inspector-ESC, Sub Inspector-ESC and Head Constable-ESC. These uniformed stress counsellors also play a major role in improving education for ITBP wards and the local children near ITBP Units. There are 21 ITBP Public Schools across the country run by ESC personnel of ITBPolice Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itbpolice.nic.in/itbpwebsite/itbpschools.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927155942/http://itbpolice.nic.in/itbpwebsite/itbpschools.html |archivedate=27 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Internal Russian passport''' (officially in {{lang-ru|Паспорт гражданина Российской Федерации}}, commonly referred to as внутренний паспорт, общегражданский паспорт) is a mandatory [[identity document]] for all [[Citizenship of Russia|Russian citizens]] residing in Russia who are aged 14 or over. The Internal Russian passport is an [[Internal passport]] used for travel and identification purposes within Russia, which is distinct from the [[Russian passport|International Russian passport]] used to Russian citizens to travel in and out of Russian borders.

After the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the [[Passport system in the Soviet Union|Soviet Union internal passport]] continued to be issued until 1997, when it was replaced by the Russian internal passport. The current Russian internal passports were first issued in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.passport-collector.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/USSR_Russian-passports.pdf Russian passport history (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Russian Government]] is planning to replace the Internal Passport with a biometric, credit card size card. The [[Universal electronic card]] issued between 2013 and 2016 was planned to replace the Russian Internal passport as the sole national identity document for [[Citizenship of Russia|Russian citizens]] but was scrapped in early 2017.

==History==
{{noref section|date=December 2014}}
In 1992, passports – or other photo identification documents – became necessary to board a train. Train tickets started to bear passenger names, allegedly, as an effort to combat speculative reselling of the tickets.

On 9 December 1992, special pages were introduced which were affixed in Soviet passports, certifying that the bearer of the passport was a citizen of Russia. These pages were optional unless travelling to the other former Soviet republics which continued to accept Soviet passports; for other occasions, other proofs of citizenship were accepted as well. Issuance of the pages continued until the end of 2002.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

On 8 July 1997, the currently-used design of the Russian internal passport was introduced.&lt;ref&gt; Decree of the President of the Russian Federation from 13.03.1997 N 232 ‘About main identity document of the
citizen of the Russian Federation on the territory of the Russian Federation’ (Указ Президента РФ от 13.03.1997 №232 Об основном документе удостоверяющем личность гражданина Российской Федерации на территории Российской Федерации).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Soviet passports, which had three photo pages, the new passports only have one. A passport is first issued at the age of 14, and then replaced upon reaching the ages of 20 and 45. The text in the passports is in [[Russian language|Russian]], but passports issued in autonomous entities may, on the bearer's request, contain an additional page duplicating all data in one of the official local languages.

A deadline for exchanging old passports for the new ones was initially set at year-end of 2001, but then extended several times and finally set at 30 June 2004. The government had first regulated that having failed to exchange one's passport would constitute a punishable violation. However, the Supreme Court ruled to the effect that citizens cannot be obliged to exchange their passports. The Soviet passports ceased to be valid as means of personal identification since mid-2004, but it is still legal (though barely practical) to have one.

The ''[[Propiska in the Soviet Union|propiska]]'' was formally abandoned soon after adoption of the current [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution]] in 1993, and replaced with "[[Resident registration in Russia|residency registration]]" which, in principle, was simply notification of one's place of residence.

Nevertheless, under the new regulations, permanent registration records are stamped in citizens' internal passports just as were ''propiska''s. This has led to the widespread misconception that registration was just a new name for the ''propiska''; many continue to call it "''propiska''". This misconception is partly reinforced by the fact that the existing rules for registration make it an onerous process, dependent on the consent of landlords, which effectively prevents tenants of flats from registering.

Internal Russian passports are issued only inside the country. Russian citizens who live abroad can get internal passport only if they visit Russia, i.e., it is not possible to get internal passport in the [[List of diplomatic missions of Russia|Russian consulate abroad]]. In practice, Russian citizens who live abroad often do not get new internal passports at all, as the law allows them to prove their identity with an [[Russian passport|international Russian passport (travel document)]].

==Description==
[[file:RussianPassport.jpg|The First page of the Passport|thumb|right]]
[[file:Pasport RF.jpg|The bio data page / second page of the passport|thumb|right]]

Each passport has a data page and a signature page. A data page has a visual zone which contains a photograph of the passport holder, data about the passport, and data about the holder:

* Surname
* Given name and [[Patronymic]]
* Sex
* Date of Birth
* Place of Birth

Special mentions shall be made in the passport:

* on the registration of a citizen within a community/at a specific address and on removal from the registration records;
* on the military conscription of citizens who have attained 18 years of age;
* on the registration and termination of a marriage;
* for children under 14 years of age;
* for any previously issued basic identity documents of a citizen of the Russian Federation on the territory of the Russian Federation;
* for the extradition of the main documents of identity of the citizen of the Russian Federation outside the Russian Federation.

At the citizen's request, the passport may also include:

* the holder's blood type and the [[Rh factor]] (added by the medical facility where the citizen's blood type and Rh were tested, for example after a blood transfusion or donation);
* the holder's tax identification number.

Passport validity:
*Issued at or after 14 years of age - valid until the age of 20;
*Issued at or after 20 years of age - valid until the age of 45;
*Issued at or after 45 years of age - valid in perpetuity.

Upon reaching  the age of 20 and 45, the passport must be replaced. While undergoing military conscription, the passport can be issued or replaced at their place of residence at the end of the set period of military service.

==Replacement with identity cards==
In November 2010 [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|the Ministry of Internal Affairs]] announced the cancellation of internal passports with the aim of replacing them with plastic identity cards or [[Driver's license#Russia|driver's license]]s by 2025. Country-wide replacement was postponed until 15 March 2018 not to interfere with [[Russian legislative election, 2016|2016 Duma election]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://government.ru/docs/all/106198/?page=2 Russian Federal Government Decree №315 from 16.04.2016 (Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;. This date however places start of the campaign 3 days before the [[Russian presidential election, 2018|2018 Presidential election]].

The '''International Young Democrat Union''' ('''IYDU''') is a global alliance of [[centre-right]] political [[youth organisation]]s and the youth wing of the [[International Democrat Union]] (IDU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Directory of British political organisations 1994 |last=Mercer |first=Paul |year=1994 |publisher=Longman |location=London |isbn=978-0-582-23729-2 |page=174 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGAvAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yearbook of International"&gt;{{cite book |title=Yearbook of International Organizations 2005/2006 |volume=1 |last= |first= |year=2005 |publisher=K.

The IYDU in its current form was founded in March 1991 in [[Washington, D.C.]].  A previous organisation of the same name had been established in July 1981, also in Washington, but subsequently ceased to exist.&lt;ref name="Yearbook of International" /&gt;

==Overview==
The IYDU stands for conservative politics and free-market policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Lester |editor-first=Ray |date=2008 |title=The New Walford Guide to Reference Resources: Volume II - Social sciences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVrgAAAAMAAJ |location= |publisher=Facet Publishing |page=215 |isbn=978-1-85604-498-1 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IYDU host a number of events for member organisations each year including a Freedom Forum (mid-year), an Annual Council Meeting, and overseas study visits.

Following almost 6 years of the IYDU being split over important differences in the interpretation of the IYDU constitution, the International Young Democrat Union Joint Council Meeting elected a unified IYDU Board in Brussels on 21 October 2017.

==Parent Organization==
The parent organisation to IYDU, the [[International Democrat Union]] (IDU)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idu.org&lt;/ref&gt; is a working association of 71 full and associate members from 63 different countries. Formed in 1983, founder members included Britain’s Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]; US Vice-President [[George H. W. Bush]]; Mayor of Paris, and later French President, [[Jacques Chirac]]; and German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12332">'''''Last in First Out''''' (LIFO) (or otherwise known as "Last One Hired is the First One Fired" is a policy often used by school districts and other employers to prioritize [[layoff]]s by [[seniority]].  Under LIFO layoff rules, junior teachers and other employees lose their jobs before senior ones.  Laying off junior employees first is not exclusive to the education sector or to the United States, but is perhaps most controversial there.  LIFO's proponents claim that it protects teachers with [[tenure]] and gives them job stability, and that it is an easily administered way of accomplishing layoffs following a budget cut.  LIFO's critics respond that it is bad for students. They prefer that the best teachers remain regardless of how long they have been teaching.

LIFO and tenure were originally intended to provide college [[professor|professors]] with [[academic freedom]] and ensure that they could research topics of their own choosing. In the K-12 sector, tenure was introduced to lower high teacher turnover rates. In 1932, over 20% of teachers were dismissed due to personal disagreements and difference of opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Butsch, R. (1937). Tenure of teachers. Teacher Personnel, 7(3), 292-295.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2010, LIFO was criticized on grounds that "seniority based layoffs result in promising, inexperienced teachers losing their positions, while their less effective, but more senior, peers continue to teach."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, D. J., Lankford, H., Loeb, S., &amp; Wyckoff, J. H. (2010). Teacher layoffs: An empirical illustration of seniority vs. measures of effectiveness. brief 12.National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/864940729&lt;/ref&gt; As of early 2014, 2 states provided that seniority could not be considered when deciding which teachers to layoff, 18 states and the District of Columbia left the layoff criteria to school district discretion, 20 states provided that seniority could be considered among other factors, and 10 states provided that seniority was the sole factor, or one that had to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara v. California - Judgment | court = Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles |date = August 27, 2014 |pinpoint = page 14, lines 10-14 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of seniority-prioritized layoffs ==

LIFO has a more severe impact in poor or high minority schools, since those schools tend to have newer and less experienced teachers. In schools where 34% or less of the students receive [[Reduced price meal|Free and Reduced meals]], more than 82% of teachers have 4 or more years of experience. However, in schools where more than 75% of the student body receives Free and Reduced meals,  only 77% of the teachers have more than 4 years of experience.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey, "Public School Teacher, BIE School Teacher, and Private School Teacher Data Files," 2007-2008&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in California, it was seen that in schools in the lowest quartile of minority students, only 8 of every 100 teachers had two or less years of teaching whereas in schools with the highest [[quartile]] of minority students, 13 of every 100 teachers had two or less years of teaching, meaning that under LIFO-based layoffs, schools with larger minority populations would lose 60% more teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Sepe, Cristina, and Marguerite Roza. The Disproportionate Impact of Seniority Based Layoffs on Poor, Minority Students. Rep. Seattle: Center on Reinventing Public Education, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, teachers in high need areas, such as secondary math and special education, are often less experienced due to the difficulty of recruiting these positions, and districts who adhere strictly to seniority based systems for layoffs face the added burden of recruiting teachers in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, Dan and Theobold, Roddy (2010). "Assessing the Determinants and Implications of Teacher Layoffs." Center for Education Data &amp; Research, University of Washington-Bothell.&lt;/ref&gt; In Los Angeles, it was noted that of the hundreds of promising new teachers cut in from the district in 2010 due to LIFO, 190 were in the top fifth overall of teachers in raising math and reading scores.&lt;ref&gt;Felch, Jason; Song, Jason; and Smith, Doug (2010). "When layoffs come to L.A. schools, performance doesn't count." Los Angeles Times, December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that the effectiveness of teachers does not change after the first few years in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hanushek]] and Steven G. Rivkin, "The Distribution of Teacher Quality and Implications for Policy." Annual Review of Economics 4 (2012): 7.1-7.27.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the implications of using LIFO rules for layoffs instead of basing layoffs on classroom effectiveness appear huge.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, Dan and Theobold, Roddy (2010). "Assessing the Determinants and Implications of Teacher Layoffs." Center for Education Data &amp; Research, University of Washington-Bothell; Steven Glazerman, Susanna Loeb, Dan Goldhaber, Douglas Staiger, Stephen Raudenbush, and Grover Whitehurst, ''Evaluating Teachers: The Important Role of Value-Added'' (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 2010); Donald Boyd, Hamilton Lankford, Susanna Loeb, and James Wyckoff, "Teacher Layoffs: An Empirical Illustration of Seniority versus Measures of Effectiveness." ''Education Finance and Policy'' 6, no. 3 (Summer 2011): 439-454.&lt;/ref&gt;{{elucidate|date=November 2015}}  With LIFO, more teachers must be dismissed to meet budgetary targets than with effectiveness-based layoffs because the youngest teachers are the least paid, but the teachers dismissed under the LIFO policy are only slightly below average in effectiveness.  An effectiveness-based policy on the other hand leads to dramatic improvements in average teacher quality, and these improvements have lasting effects on students throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hanushek]], "Valuing teachers: How much is a good teacher worth?" ''Education Next'' 11, no. 3 (Summer 2011); Raj Chetty, John N. Friedman, and Jonah E. Rockoff, "The Long-Term Impacts of Teachers: Teacher Value-Added and Student Outcomes in Adulthood," WP17699 (Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic Research, December 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==LIFO and value-added economic modeling==
{{POV-section|date=July 2017}}
In many states, tenure is given to teachers after 3 years, without much indication of job performance. A [[Value-added modeling|value added model]] (VAM) could be used in tenure decisions for teachers in order to estimate teacher quality. A VAM would predict how well a teacher would do based on his or her previous experience teaching. Data shows that the VAM based on standardized test scores, is a better indicator of teacher performance than any observable attributes. 
&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, Dan, &amp; Hansen, M. (2010). Using performance on the job to inform teacher tenure decisions. The American Economic Review, 100(2), 250-250-255. {{doi|10.1257/aer.100.2.250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In using a VAM to evaluate teachers for a tenure decision, school districts can ensure that the teachers they retain (and the teachers who in turn become the most senior) are effective educators, thereby eliminating some of the discrepancy between LIFO and performance-based layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, D. (2003). Evaluating value-added models for teacher accountability. Santa Monica: Rand Publishing.Retrieved from https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2004/RAND_MG158.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy and the overhaul of LIFO ==

Since less experienced teachers typically have lower salaries, it is estimated that if districts in the [[United States]] cut 5% of their budget through seniority based layoffs, approximately 79,000 more teachers would lose their jobs versus seniority neutral layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;The Case Against Quality Blind Teacher Layoffs. Publication. The New Teacher Project, Feb. 2011. Web. 10 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://tntp.org/files/TNTP_Case_Against_Quality_Blind_Layoffs_Feb2011.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of New York State parents regarding teacher quality versus seniority,  voters said they did not care how long a teacher had taught so long as the teacher was effective and produced good results.&lt;ref&gt;New York voters oppose "last-in, first-out" for teacher layoffs - NYPOST.com. (n.d.). . Retrieved April 24, 2011, from http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/voters_ax_the_worst_X4kKxTM7P75e9enFpDuTkI&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with Arizona in 2009, certain states and districts have been passing laws which prohibit seniority from being the deciding factor in layoff decisions. Maine, Louisiana, and District of Columbia use multiple criteria in determining layoffs, and numerous other states are trending towards performance based over seniority based layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;Teacher Layoffs: Rethinking "Last-Hired, First Fired" Policies. Rep. National Council on Teacher Quality, Feb. 2010. Web. 10 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.nctq.org/p/docs/nctq_dc_layoffs.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michelle Rhee]], the former Chancellor of Washington, D.C. public schools, opposes the Last in First Out policy, instead suggesting performance based evaluation to determine layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;End "last in, first out" teacher layoffs - CNN.com. (n.d.). . Retrieved May 2, 2011, from http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/02/23/rhee.layoff.policy/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  As Chancellor, she introduced the [http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/impact IMPACT] evaluation for teachers, which measured teacher performance and was the primary factor for layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;The Case Against Quality Blind Teacher Layoffs. Publication. The New Teacher Project, Feb. 2011. Web. 10 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://tntp.org/files/TNTP_Case_Against_Quality_Blind_Layoffs_Feb2011.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  She is the CEO of  [http://www.studentsfirst.org Students First], a [[grassroots]] movement "designed to mobilize parents, teacher, students, and administrators, and citizens" to demand a better American education system.&lt;ref&gt;"About Students First." Studentsfirst.org. Web. 10 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.studentsfirst.org/pages/about-students-first&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding in 2010, Studentsfirst has been behind legislation across the country which promotes alternative [[teacher quality assessment]] methods through its "Save Great Teachers" Campaign. Victories from this campaign have been seen in Florida, Utah, Michigan, Nevada and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;"Save Great Teachers." Save Great Teachers- Studentsfirst.org. Web. 10 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.studentsfirst.org/lifo&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 court case of ''[[Vergara v. California]]'' struck down California's LIFO layoff rules as having a disproportionately negative impact on poor and minority public school students, thus violating the California Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara v. California - Judgment | court = Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles |date = August 27, 2014 |pinpoint = page 3, lines 19-27 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Vergara'' trial judge noted that teacher layoffs prioritized solely by seniority prevented senior and ineffective teachers from being laid off before junior but effective teachers.  In this situation, "[n]o matter how gifted the junior teacher, and no matter how grossly ineffective the senior teacher, the junior gifted one . . . is separated from [the students] and a senior grossly ineffective one . . . is left in place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 13, lines 19-23 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge concluded that "[t]he logic of [this scheme] is unfathomable and therefore constitutionally unsupportable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 14, lines 4-5 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11094">Many countries have a '''language policy''' designed to favor or discourage the use of a particular [[language]] or set of languages. Although nations historically have used language policies most often to promote one [[official language]] at the expense of others, many countries now have policies designed to protect and promote 
regional and ethnic languages whose viability is threatened. Indeed, whilst the existence of [[Minority language|linguistic minorities]] within their jurisdiction has often been considered to be a potential threat to internal cohesion, States also understand that providing language rights to minorities may be more in their long term interest, as a means of gaining citizens' trust in the central government.&lt;ref&gt;Arzoz, X., 'The Nature of Language Rights'. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe (2007): 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language policy is what a government does either officially through [[legislation]], court decisions or policy to determine how languages are used, cultivate language skills needed to meet national priorities or to establish the rights of individuals or groups to use and maintain languages. The scope of language policy varies in practice from State to State. This may be explained by the fact that language policy is often based on contingent historical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Id., at page 23&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, States also differ as to the degree of explicitness with which they implement a given language policy. The French [[Toubon Law|Toubon]] law is a good example of explicit language policy. The same may be said for the [[Charter of the French Language|Charter]] of the French Language in [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Jeught, S., EU Language Law (2015), Europa Law Publishing: Groningen, 15 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The preservation of [[cultural diversity|cultural]] and [[linguistic diversity]] in today's world is a major concern to many scientists, artists, writers, politicians, leaders of linguistic communities, and defenders of [[linguistic human rights]]. More than half of the 6000 languages currently spoken in the world are estimated to be in danger of disappearing during the 21st century. Many factors affect the existence and usage of any given human language, including the size of the native speaking population, its use in formal communication, and the geographical dispersion and the socio-economic weight of its speakers. National language policies can either mitigate or exacerbate the effects of some of these factors.

For example, according to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], "Native tongue title and language rights should be promoted. The government ought to define Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander vernaculars as official languages of Australia. We must change the linguistic landscape of Whyalla and elsewhere. Signs should be in both English and the local indigenous language. We ought to acknowledge intellectual property of indigenous knowledge including language, music and dance."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]], [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/opinion/stop-revive-and-survive/story-e6frgcko-1226385194433 "Stop, revive and survive"], ''The Australian Higher Education'', June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ways in which language policies can be categorized. It was elaborated by [[Université Laval]] [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguist]] [[Jacques Leclerc (linguist)|Jacques Leclerc]] for the French-language Web site ''L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde'' put on line by the [[CIRAL]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;(French) Leclerc, Jacques. [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/monde/index_politique-lng.htm "Index par politiques linguistiques"] in ''L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde'', Québec, TLFQ, [[Université Laval]], December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The collecting, translating and classifying of language policies started in 1988 and culminated in the publishing of ''Recueil des législations linguistiques dans le monde'' (vol. I to VI) at Presses de l'Université Laval in 1994. The work, containing some 470 language laws, and the research leading to publication, were subsidised by the [[Office québécois de la langue française]].&lt;ref&gt;Leclerc, Jacques. [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/monde/historique_du_site.htm "Historique du site du CIRAL au TLFQ"] in ''L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde'', Québec, TLFQ, [[Université Laval]], August 16, 2007 (in French).&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, the Web site presented the linguistic portrait and language policies in 354 States or autonomous territories in 194 recognised countries.&lt;ref&gt;Leclerc, Jacques.

'''Liberty Counsel''' is a [[501(c)(3)]]&lt;ref name= irseo/&gt; tax-exempt organization that promotes [[litigation]] related to [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-03-23/news/0103230243_1_liberty-counsel-first-time-morgan-mathew-staver|title=Group Sues Schools Over Religious Cards|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberty Counsel was founded in 1989&lt;ref name= corp/&gt; by its [[chairman]] [[Mathew D. Staver]] and its [[President (corporation)|president]] Anita L. Staver, who are attorneys and married to each other. The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] has listed Liberty Counsel as an [[anti-LGBT]] [[hate group]], a designation which has been disputed by the group.

Liberty Counsel advocates "stand[ing] in solidarity with Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Liberty Counsel Founder Urges Christians to Stand With Israel|url = http://www.charismanews.com/us/39347-liberty-counsel-founder-urges-christians-to-stand-with-israel|website = Charisma News|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberty Counsel agreed with the military policy banning homosexual activity within the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/politics/story.php?id=33767|title='Don't Ask Don't Tell' Upheld by Supreme Court|author=Catholic Online|work=catholic.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606084658/http://www.catholic.org/politics/story.php?id=33767|archivedate=2011-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opposes the addition of sexual orientation, gender identity, or similar provisions to [[hate crimes]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lc.org/media/9980/attachments/hatecrimes.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberty Counsel also opposes same-sex marriage, civil unions, and adoption by gay people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lc.org/index.cfm?pid=14096 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100819192523/http%3A//www.lc.org/index.cfm?pid%3D14096 |archivedate=2010-08-19 |df= }} "First case ever to declare a Vermont civil union is not equivalent to marriage, and a state and federal Defense of Marriage Act permits a state to ban same sex unions."&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberty Counsel has been listed as an [[anti-gay]] group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/anti-gay/active_hate_groups|title=Active Anti-LGBT Groups|work=Southern Poverty Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC). In October 2015, SPLC listed the group as a [[hate group]], in part for opposing LGBT individual's participation in the [[Scouts]] and for Liberty Counsel's leadship implicitly comparing gay men to pedophiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/active-hate-groups-united-states-2014|title=Active Hate Groups in the United States in 2014|work=Southern Poverty Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Boy Scouts Organization Demise.''

In June 2017 it sued [[GuideStar|GuideStar USA, Inc.]], an information service specializing in reporting on U.S. nonprofit companies, for flagging it as having been labeled a hate group by the SPLC. In January 2018 a Virginia Federal judge ruled that GuideStar has First Amendment protection for its "expressive right to comment on social issues." The SPLC was not named in the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"&gt;{{cite news|title=Maitland-based Liberty Counsel loses lawsuit over 'hate group' label|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-liberty-counsel-lawsuit-20180124-story.html|accessdate=17 March 2018|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; GuideStar removed the labels from the entries for Liberty Counsel and 45 other organizations shortly after adding them, saying that "Dismayingly, a significant amount of the feedback we've received in recent days has shifted from constructive criticism to harassment and threats directed at our staff and leadership.
With this development in mind—driven by both our commitment to objectivity and our concerns for our staff's wellbeing—we have decided to remove the SPLC annotations from these 46 organizations for the time being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Update Regarding SPLC Flags on GuideStar Nonprofit Profiles|url=https://learn.guidestar.org/news/news-releases/update-regarding-splc-flags-on-guidestar-nonprofit-profiles|website=GuideStar|publisher=GuideStar|accessdate=17 March 2018|date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Liberty Counsel threatened legal action against a public library in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. Liberty Counsel complained after being contacted by parents who complained about "[[Hogwarts]]' Certificate of Accomplishment" to students who attended a party featuring readings from ''[[Harry Potter]]'' books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jacksonville parents object to Harry Potter's 'witchcraft' {{!}} StAugustine.com|url = http://staugustine.com/stories/091300/sta_20000913.021.shtml#.Vi5iBzZdFcB|website = staugustine.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075915/http://staugustine.com/stories/091300/sta_20000913.021.shtml#.Vi5iBzZdFcB|archive-date = 2016-03-04|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Staver said that "Witchcraft is a religion, and the certificate of witchcraft endorsed a particular religion in violation of the [[First Amendment]]'s [[Establishment Clause]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2000/september2000/jacksonville.cfm | title = Jacksonville Library Drops Harry Potter Certificates | accessdate = October 22, 2008 | publisher = American Library Assoc. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081013173224/http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2000/september2000/jacksonville.cfm | archivedate = October 13, 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, Liberty Counsel issued a press release accusing an elementary school in [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin]], of changing the lyrics of Christmas songs to make them more secular, and said that it would sue the school district "if the district does not immediately remedy the situation." The school was putting on the play "The Little Tree's Christmas Gift", written by Dwight Elrich, a former church choir director.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/19/AR2005121901802.html "Have a Holly, Jolly Holiday"], [[The Washington Post]], Dec. 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgeville school district attempted to seek a retraction and an apology from Liberty Counsel, as well as reimbursement of $20,000 spent in personnel, security, and attorney fees to fight the accusation. Liberty Counsel's Staver refused, asserting, "There is nothing to apologize for or retract."&lt;ref&gt;"Haven't heard last on 'Silent Night'; Wis. school board is seeking redress from Christian legal group", ''Richmond Times-Dispatch'', January 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Liberty Counsel threatened to sue a Wisconsin school because they wanted to give a reading of the book ''I am Jazz'', a book by Jessica Herthel and transgender teenager [[Jazz Jennings]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.advocate.com/media/2015/11/29/hate-group-forces-school-cancel-i-am-jazz-book-reading&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc.]]'' (1994)&lt;ref&gt;512 U.S. 753 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; In a partial victory for Liberty Counsel, the United States Supreme Court defined the limits of [[injunctive relief]] available to [[abortion clinic]]s against pickets and demonstrators. The Court established the Madsen Test, which provides that injunctive relief can be granted when it is shown that the defendant has violated or imminently will violate some provision of law, there is a discernible danger of recurrent violations, and a following speech restrictive injunction may not burden speech more than necessary to serve a significant government interest.&lt;ref&gt;Mathew D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5853">The '''National Industrial Security Program''', or '''NISP''', is the nominal authority (in the [[United States]]) for managing the needs of [[private sector|private industry]] to access [[classified information in the United States|classified information]].{{fact|date=April 2016}}

The NISP was established in 1993 by '''[[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 12829'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/eo12829.htm|title=Executive Order 12829|work=[[Federation of American Scientists|FAS]] website|accessdate=2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] nominally sets policy for the NISP, while the Director of the [[Information Security Oversight Office]] is nominally the authority for implementation.  Under the ISOO, the [[Secretary of Defense]] is nominally the Executive Agent, but the NISP recognizes four different Cognizant Security Agencies, all of which have equal authority: the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], and the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dss.mil/isec/nispbrochure.pdf| title=NISP Brochure | publisher=[[Defense Security Service|DSS]]| format=PDF | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420050102/http://www.dss.mil/isec/nispbrochure.pdf | archivedate=2006-04-20 | accessdate=2007-04-01 }} (59 KB)&lt;/ref&gt;

== NISP Operating Manual (DoD 5220.22-M) ==
A major component of the NISP is the '''NISP Operating Manual''', also called '''NISPOM''', or '''DoD  5220.22-M'''. The NISPOM establishes the standard procedures and requirements for all government contractors, with regards to classified information. {{As of|2017}}, the current NISPOM edition is dated 28 Feb 2006.  Chapters and selected sections of this edition are:&lt;ref name="nispom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dss.mil/isp/fac_clear/download_nispom.html|title=Download NISPOM|publisher=[[Defense Security Service|DSS]]|accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data sanitization===
DoD 5220.22-M is sometimes cited as a standard for [[Sanitization (classified information)|sanitization]] to counter [[data remanence]].  The NISPOM actually covers the entire field of government–industrial security, of which data sanitization is a very small part (about two paragraphs in a 141-page document).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dss.mil/documents/odaa/nispom2006-5220.pdf#page=75|title = National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM)|accessdate = 2013-03-07|author = DoD|publisher = [[Defense Security Service|DSS]]|date = 2006-02-28|pages = 8–3-1|format = PDF|authorlink = United States Department of Defense}} (1.92 MB)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the NISPOM does not actually specify any particular method.  Standards for sanitization are left up to the Cognizant Security Authority.  The [[Defense Security Service]] provides a ''Clearing and Sanitization Matrix'' (C&amp;SM) which does specify methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregon.gov/DAS/OP/docs/policy/state/107-009-005_Exhibit_B.pdf| title=DSS Clearing &amp; Sanitization Matrix|publisher=[[Defense Security Service|DSS]]| format=PDF|date=2007-06-28|accessdate=2011-04-26}} (98 KB)&lt;/ref&gt;  As of the June 2007 edition of the DSS C&amp;SM, overwriting is no longer acceptable for sanitization of magnetic media; only [[degaussing]] or physical destruction is acceptable.&lt;ref name="dec18"&gt;NIST (2014-12-18).

===2011 election===
The Conservatives contested the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|November 2011 general election]]. In October 2011 they announced electoral alliances with [[The Kiwi Party]] and [[New Citizen Party]], in which their candidates stood instead as Conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10759055 |title=No Kiwi Party candidates in this year's election |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=14 October 2011 |accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/5807380/New-Citizens-Party-joins-with-Conservatives |title=New Citizens Party joins with Conservatives |author=Danya Levy |publisher=Stuff |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party ran a list of 52 candidates, including Kiwi Party leader [[Larry Baldock]] and former New Citizen [[Botany (New Zealand electorate)|Botany]] candidate Paul Young.&lt;ref name="conservativelist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1111/S00014/conservative-list-released.htm |title=Conservative list released |publisher=Press Release: Conservative Party (via Scoop.co.nz) |date=1 November 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig stood in the [[Rodney (New Zealand electorate)|Rodney]] electorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10752761|title=Colin Craig won't go up against John Banks|date=19 September 2011|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party spent NZ$1.88 million on its campaign, the second-highest of any party,&lt;ref name="least_bang"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10794298|title=Conservatives got least bang for buck|last=Young|first=Audrey|date=24 March 2012|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with most of the money coming from Craig himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10767788|title=Election 2011: Craig spends $1 million to push his new party's plans|date=22 November 2011|work=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaign the party portrayed itself as able to work with either of the two main parties, [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]].&lt;ref name=nzh4&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10765411 |title=Conservative Party still working on major policies |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=11 November 2011 |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It highlighted its socially conservative policies of raising the [[drinking age]] to 21, parental notification for abortions, and repeal of the [[Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007|"anti-smacking" law]].&lt;ref name=nzh4/&gt; It announced its opposition to National's policy of selling state assets.&lt;ref name=nzh4/&gt;

The party gained 2.65% of the [[party vote]] (59,237 votes), but failed to win any seats in Parliament.&lt;ref name=2011results&gt;{{cite web |url=http://electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2011/partystatus.html |title=Official count results – overall status |publisher=New Zealand Electoral Commission |date=17 December 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig came second in Rodney, gaining 8,031 votes – 12,222 votes behind first-time National Party candidate [[Mark Mitchell (politician)|Mark Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2011/electorate-44.html |title=Official count results – Rodney |publisher=New Zealand Electoral Commission |date=10 December 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the election, Conservative candidates Larry Baldock and Peter Redman were referred to police for filing false expenses returns and for exceeding the $25,000 cap on election expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/referral-police-16-april-2013 |title=Referral to the Police 16 April 2013 |publisher=New Zealand Electoral Commission |date=16 April 2013 |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Craig stated that if the Police found any impropriety neither Larry Baldock nor Peter Redman would be allowed to stand as Conservative candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/pb/nz/news/article.cfm|title=NZ News – Latest and Breaking News from NZ Herald|publisher=|via=www.nzherald.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police subsequently declined to lay charges in the matter.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===2011 to 2014===
In May 2013, the party appointed high-profile former [[Ministry of Social Development (New Zealand)|Work and Income New Zealand]] chief executive [[Christine Rankin]] as its chief executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1305/S00131/conservative-partys-new-ceo-christine-rankin.htm |title=Conservative Party's new CEO Christine Rankin |publisher=Conservative Party |date=10 May 2013 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party contested the [[Christchurch East by-election, 2013|2013 Christchurch East by-election]]; candidate Leighton Baker polled 487 votes (or 3.65%) in the preliminary count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/christchurch-east-election-preliminary-results |title=Christchurch East By-election Preliminary Vote Results|date=30 November 2013|publisher=[[Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party also contested the [[New Zealand local elections, 2013|2013 local elections]], fielding 27 candidates in [[Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/AboutCouncil/HowCouncilWorks/Elections/Documents/lbfinalresults2013.pdf |title=Local boards final results |publisher=Auckland Council |date=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/regional/216328/conservative-party-to-contest-auckland-elections |title=Conservative Party to contest Auckland elections|date=7 August 2013 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party gained 50,218 votes overall, and two candidates (Christine Rankin and Callum Blair) were elected to the Upper Harbour Local Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vote.co.nz/2013/elections/auckland-council-upper-harbour-local-board |title=Auckland Council – Upper Harbour Local Board |publisher=Local Government Online |date= |accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the-then [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] co-leader [[Russel Norman]] alleged during a speech at the Big Gay Out event in Auckland that Colin Craig held misogynistic and homophobic attitudes. Norman's comments prompted Craig to file a defamation suit and to demand that Norman issue an apology. Norman and the Green Party announced that they would contest the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davison|first1=Isaac|title=Colin Craig to limit his defamation claim|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11213649|accessdate=11 August 2015|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October 2014, following the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014 general election]], the parties settled the lawsuit out of court and agreed to bear their own legal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wong|first1=Simon|title=Colin Craig drops defamation case against Russel Norman|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/colin-craig-drops-defamation-case-against-russel-norman-2014101015#axzz3iY3Nkw7R|accessdate=11 August 2015|publisher=3 News|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 election===
In November 2013 speculation arose in the New Zealand news media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Edwards |first = Bryce | title = Bryce Edwards: Political roundup: Winning at the 2014 general election |url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11163647 | work = New Zealand Herald | date = 27 November 2013 | accessdate = 21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; about a possible accommodation between the Conservatives and the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] for the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014 general election]]. Comments by Prime Minister and National Party leader [[John Key]] led to speculation of a coalition in which the National Party would not run a candidate in a constituency on Auckland's [[North Shore City|North Shore]], such as [[Rodney (New Zealand electorate)|Rodney]], or [[East Coast Bays (New Zealand electorate)|East Coast Bays]],&lt;ref name="National Business Review"&gt;{{cite web | last=Hooton|first=Matthew|title=National Must Gift East Coast Bays to Colin Craig |url= http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/hooton-on-colin-craig |accessdate=4 December 2013 |date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the newly formed {{NZ electorate link|Upper Harbour}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Changes Proposed to Electorate Boundaries |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/changes-proposed-electorate-boundaries-0 |publisher=Electoral Commission|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would assist the Conservative Party in meeting the [[MMP in New Zealand|threshold]] for entering parliament.

The Conservative Party announced the top five positions for its party list on 22 August 2014. The top five were leader Colin Craig, Epsom candidate Christine Rankin, Garth McVicar, Melissa Perkin, and [[Māngere (New Zealand electorate)|Māngere]] candidate Edward Saafi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10413477/Conservative-Party-list-balanced |title=Conservative Party list 'balanced' |author=Stacey Kirk |publisher=''Stuff'' |date=22 August 2014 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Electoral Commission awarded the Conservatives $60,000 in advertising funding for the 2014 general election, three times the $20,800 allocation it made to the Conservatives in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11269245|title=Advertising funding down for Nats, Labour; up for Greens, NZ First|date=7 June 2014|publisher=''New Zealand Herald''|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2014 Colin Craig revealed that China-based firm Shanghai Pengxin was purchasing Lochinver Station, a large dairy farm, and said that the Conservatives were opposed to the deal.&lt;ref name="nzhfarm1"/&gt; Craig won a High Court injunction on 8 August 2014 to prevent TV3 from excluding him from a minor leader's debate that was to have included lower polling parties such as [[ACT New Zealand]] and [[United Future]].

===2015 resignations of leader and board members===
[[File:New Zealand Conservative Party logo.png|thumb|right|The logo of the New Zealand Conservative Party.]]
On 19 June 2015, the Conservative Party's leader Colin Craig resigned. Board members had scheduled a meeting for that day to discuss the leadership as it was felt that Craig's recent participation in a television interview (with [[David Farrier]] on the debut episode of ''[[Newsworthy (TV programme)|Newsworthy]]'') conducted in a sauna had reflected badly on the party. Dissatisfaction had also been expressed over Craig's demeanour toward the party's former press secretary Rachel MacGregor, who had resigned just before the 2014 general election. Dissatisfaction increased when Craig pre-emptively and perhaps unconstitutionally postponed the meeting for a week in order to announce his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farrier|first1=David|title=The Sauna Session That May Bring Down Colin Craig|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/tvshows/newsworthy/sauna-session-with-colin-craig-2015060823#axzz3dYJsninl|accessdate=19 June 2015|agency=[[3 News]]|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Audrey|title=Colin Craig could face the chop after TV antics|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11467479|accessdate=19 June 2015|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Stacey|title=Conservative faction to block Colin Craig's return as leader|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/69559312/conservative-faction-to-block-colin-craigs-return-as-leader|accessdate=19 June 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig later announced that he would consider contesting the party's leadership if he had enough support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watkins|first1=Tracey|title=Colin Craig off to lawyers, would consider a Conservative Party comeback|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/69567213/colin-craig-off-to-lawyers-would-consider-a-conservative-party-comeback|accessdate=21 June 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 June, the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' reported that Craig had settled the dispute with MacGregor for around NZ$16,000 to NZ$17,000 eight weeks earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bilbey|first1=Lynley|title=Colin Craig entangled in money dispute|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11468628|accessdate=21 June 2015|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The television channel [[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] also reported that there was a disagreement between Craig and several of the party's board members. One member, John Stringer, accused Craig of not following the party's constitution. Craig denied the allegation and threatened to take action against Stringer. The Chairman of the Board stated that Stringer's views did not reflect the view of the Conservative Party and that his comments were only his opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/colin-craig-claims-evidence-allegations-withheld-conservative-party-6342837 | accessdate=21 June 2015 | title=Colin Craig claims evidence of allegations withheld by Conservative Party | date=21 June 2015 | agency=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a media conference held on 22 June 2015, Craig admitted that he had "acted inappropriately" toward his press secretary Rachel MacGregor but denied any charge of sexual harassment. In response, MacGregor said that by making the admission, Craig had breached a confidentiality agreement the pair had reached under Human Rights Commission mediation and she disputed his account of the events. Craig's wife Helen Craig also announced that she was standing by her husband and characterized the charges against him as "false allegations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig admits 'inappropriate' conduct|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/69601091/colin-craig-admits-inappropriate-conduct|accessdate=22 June 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Factual inaccuracies' – former press secretary speaks out after Colin Craig denies allegations|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/factual-inaccuracies-former-press-secretary-speaks-after-colin-craig-denies-allegations-6343893|accessdate=22 June 2015|agency=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]]|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Herald'', several board members of the party including Stringer, [[Christine Rankin]], and Laurence Day indicated support for a change of leadership. A board meeting was scheduled for 27 June 2015 and Day called for Craig to be expelled from the party. Rankin and two other party members, [[Sensible Sentencing Trust]] leader [[Garth McVicar]] and [[Family First New Zealand|Family First]] founder [[Bob McCoskrie]], ruled out contesting the leadership.&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 22 June 2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11469194|title=Calls for Colin Craig's party membership to be cancelled|date=22 June 2015|work=[[New Zealand Herald]]|last1=Davison|first1=Isaac|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the week that immediately followed Craig's resignation, all remaining members of the board, with the exception of Stringer, resigned. On 27 June 2015, at the scheduled board meeting, Stringer appointed a new board consisting of himself as chairman and four new members. This board voted to suspend Craig's membership in the party. Stringer said that a final decision about Craig's membership and the appointment of a new leader would be made at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig's membership suspended|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11472161}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to One News, Craig later challenged the legality of Stringer's and the board's actions, claiming that Stringer had been suspended from the party. He did not rule out contesting the leadership. Craig's remarks were dismissed by Stringer, who became the party's interim leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig has Conservative Party membership suspended |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/colin-craig-has-conservative-party-membership-suspended-6347983 |accessdate=27 June 2015 |publisher=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]]|date=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 2015, Stringer resigned his positions as chairman and board member in the wake of the statements that he had been suspended from the party and was therefore not entitled to hold them. According to the ''New Zealand Herald'', a statement by former chairman Brian Dobbs that Stringer had been suspended meant that the decision by the interim board to suspend Craig's membership was invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=11476110 | accessdate=6 July 2015 | title=Conservative Party battle draws to a close | date=5 July 2015 | publisher=''The New Zealand Herald'', Auckland, New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 July, Craig sent a personal letter to Conservative Party members to apologise for his behaviour and to gauge whether he had sufficient support to return to the party's leadership.&lt;ref name="ODT 7 July 2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig asks for forgiveness|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/politics/348330/colin-craig-asks-forgiveness|accessdate=10 July 2015|publisher=''[[Otago Daily Times]]''|date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Stacey|title=Colin Craig asks forgiveness and puts his political future to a ballot|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/70035019/colin-craig-asks-forgiveness-and-puts-his-political-future-to-a-ballot|accessdate=10 July 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=7 July 1025}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 July 2015, the ''New Zealand Herald'' reported that a [[3News]]-Reid Research poll had found support for the party to be only 0.7 per cent, the lowest it has polled since just before the 2011 General Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=11486938 | accessdate=26 July 2015 | title=Conservative Party support plunges to all-time low | date=26 July 2015 | publisher=''The New Zealand Herald'', Auckland, NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 July 2015, Craig embarked on a lawsuit against several opponents including the [[New Zealand Taxpayers' Union]]'s executive director Jordan Williams, fellow party member John Stringer, and the right wing blogger [[Cameron Slater]] for alleged defamation. Craig also circulated a booklet, titled ''Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas'', in which he outlined a "campaign of defamatory lies" against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Corazon|last2=Davison|first2=Isaac|title=Colin Craig sues 'dirty politics brigade'|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11488774|accessdate=11 August 2015|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Craig |first=Colin |date=2015 |title=Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas |url=http://votecolincraig.co.nz/documents/Dirty%20Politics.pdf |location=Auckland |publisher=Colin and Helen Craig |agency= |access-date=11 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925161400/http://votecolincraig.co.nz/documents/Dirty%20Politics.pdf |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 August 2015, Stringer responded by lodging a complaint against Craig with the [[New Zealand Police]], alleging that Craig had exceeded his allocated election fund legal limit by NZ$2,000 when contesting the East Coast Bays electorate in 2014. A police investigation subsequently cleared Craig of any wrongdoing.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In addition, Stringer criticized Craig's management of the Conservative Party's 2014 election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hutching|first1=Chris|title=Stringer reveals allegations he has taken to the police|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/stringer-reveals-allegations-he-has-taken-police-ch-176899|accessdate=11 August 2015|publisher=''[[National Business Review]]''|date=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Stringer submitted a dossier of documents to both the police and the [[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Peter|last2=Robson|first2=Sarah|title=Colin Craig documents given to police|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/colin-craig-documents-given-to-police-2015081115#axzz3iY3Nkw7R|accessdate=11 August 2015|agency=3 News|date=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 August 2015, Jordan Williams launched a counter-suit against Craig and several Conservative Party officials in response to Craig's statements at the July press conference and in the circular ''Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Nicholas|title=Legal action taken against Colin Craig|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11497297|accessdate=16 August 2015|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 September 2015, Craig filed a retaliatory defamation suit against the party's former chairman, John Stringer. Stringer indicated that he would contest the charges in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig files defamation suit|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/283990/colin-craig-files-defamation-suit|accessdate=11 October 2015|publisher=Radio New Zealand News|date=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 November 2015, Craig announced that he would not be contesting the Conservative Party leadership in light of a police investigation against him over his party's spending during the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014 general election]]. Craig also cited the ongoing lawsuits involving him, Cameron Slater, and Stringer as other reasons for his decision not to contest the party leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davidson|first1=Isaac|title=Colin Craig won't seek re-election|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11546300|accessdate=17 November 2015|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the newly elected Conservative Party board chair Leighton Baker indicated that the party was "in no hurry" to appoint a new leadership until it had rebuilt its membership base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Stacey|title=Colin Craig not seeking re-election as Conservative Party leader|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/74089024/colin-craig-not-seeking-reelection-as-conservative-party-leader|accessdate=17 November 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation involving Colin Craig===
On 19 January 2016, Colin Craig donated NZ$36,000 to the Conservative Party. Despite his lack of involvement with the leadership, he stated that he and his wife still wanted to support the party financially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sachdeva|first1=Sam|title=Colin Craig donates $36,000 to Conservative Party after resigning as leader|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/76001561/colin-craig-donates-36000-to-conservative-party-after-resigning-as-leader|accessdate=3 February 2016|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 February 2016, the party's board validated the decision of the previous board to suspend John Stringer's membership. The suspension was part of an ongoing internal conflict within the party between Stringer and former party leader Craig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marwick|first1=Felix|title=Stringer's Conservative Party suspension confirmed|url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/politics/stringers-conservative-party-suspension-confirmed/|accessdate=3 February 2016|agency=Newstalk ZB|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 2016, it was reported that Stringer had dropped his defamation suit against Craig and was seeking legal advice to ensure that his statement of defence complied with court rules for defamation cases. However, Craig's lawsuit against Stringer and Jordan Williams' lawsuit against Craig remained ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Van Breynen|first1=Martin|title=John Stringer dumps claim against Colin Craig in Christchurch defamation action|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/77468166/John-Stringer-dumps-claim-against-Colin-Craig-in-Christchurch-defamation-action|accessdate=11 April 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, the Auckland High Court began hearing Jordan Williams' defamation lawsuit against Craig, expected to last five weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig in court to defend defamation Action|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/312572/colin-craig-in-court-to-defend-defamation-case|accessdate=6 September 2016|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September, the former party chief executive and [[Epsom (New Zealand electorate)|Epsom]] candidate [[Christine Rankin]] testified that revelations about Craig's alleged romantic impropriety with his press secretary Rachel MacGregor had led her to doubt his suitability to lead the Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tahana|first1=Yvonne|title=Christine Rankin changed her opinion of Colin Craig after sext revelations, court hears|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/christine-rankin-changed-her-opinion-colin-craig-after-sext-revelations-court-hears|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=One News|date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September, the party's former board member John Stringer alleged that Craig had acted inappropriately toward other women and said that there had been so much concern about his relationship with MacGregor that the party had arranged a chaperone to accompany them whenever they were together. Stringer claimed in his testimony that Craig had dismissed concerns about his alleged sexual impropriety raised by the party's board. He also alleged that Craig had created a "cult-like" atmosphere within the Conservative Party and that Craig had disciplined, harassed, and denigrated members who had disagreed with him. Stringer denied Craig's assertions that there was a "Dirty Politics" strategy within the party to unseat him and claimed that the party had lost confidence in their leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hollingworth|first1=Adam|title=Colin Craig needed chaperone around MacGregor – Stringe|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/nznews/colin-craig-needed-chaperone-around-macgregor---stringer-2016091212|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=Newshub|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 and 15 September, MacGregor testified that Craig's alleged harassment during the three years of her employment had contributed to her decision to resign two days prior to the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014 general election]]. In her testimony, she cited a pay dispute as the final straw in her decision to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Rachel MacGregor's text messages to Colin Craig read to court|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/84256582/former-conservative-leader-colin-craig-under-huge-pressure-lawyers-say|accessdate=15 September 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September, Colin Craig took the stand to testify in his defence. While denying that he sexually harassed MacGregor, Craig likened their relationship to that of siblings. He also admitted kissing her but insisted it was consensual. In his defence, Craig claimed that MacGregor had resigned primarily because he had rejected her marriage proposal on the grounds that he was already married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fagan|first1=Josh|title=Colin Craig denies sexual harassment, explicit texts, but admits there was a kiss|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/84324546/colin-craig-denies-sexual-harassment-explicit-texts-but-admits-there-was-a-kiss|accessdate=16 September 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Did she think I would leave my wife?|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11711164|accessdate=16 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September, Craig's wife Helen Craig testified that MacGregor had privately contacted her to confess to having an emotional relationship with Craig and kissing Craig on the night of the 2011 general election. Helen also confirmed that she had forgiven her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Court hears of 'relationship rules' between Rachel MacGregor and Colin Craig|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/84440974/macgregor-took-restraining-order-against-colin-craig-associate|accessdate=20 September 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Craig had admitted kissing McGregor, he denied undressing or having sexual intercouse with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Colin Craig on kiss with press secretary|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11713454|accessdate=20 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September, the investigative journalist [[Nicky Hager]] testified as an expert witness. In his testimony, he alleged that the information that had been released about Colin Craig on blogs like Cameron Slater's Whale Oil matched the patterns he had documented in his book ''[[Dirty Politics]]'', which had inspired Craig's pamphlet "Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Colin Craig defamation trial: Dirty Politics author Nicky Hager takes the stand|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11714115|accessdate=21 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Dobbs, the former chairman of the Conservative Party, also testified that he and several other board members had expressed their dissatisfaction with Craig's and MacGregor's relationship. He criticised Craig for proceeding with the 2015 sauna interview without consulting him first. Dobbs disclosed that Williams had showed him a collection of love letters, poems, emails, and other correspondence between Craig and MacGregor in June 2015 in an alleged attempt to turn him against Craig. Dobbs also criticised MacGregor's resignation for contributing to the party's disappointing performance in the 2011 general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig defamation trial: Nicky Hager gives evidence|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/313866/colin-craig-defamation-trial-hager-gives-evidence|accessdate=22 September 2016|publisher=Radio New Zealand|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September, former Conservative Party board member Laurence Day disputed MacGregor's claim that Colin Craig had sexually harassed her, on the grounds that Williams had failed to present the incriminating alleged "sext" text message. He also alleged that Williams was trying to use the sexual harassment allegations to turn the party board members against Craig; a position that was echoed by another witness, [[Family First New Zealand|Family First]] director [[Bob McCoskrie]]. Day and McCoskrie supported Craig's assertion that his relationship with MacGregor had been inappropriate but consensual. McCoskrie defended Craig's pamphlet as a response to the alleged "organized campaign" against Craig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Former Conservative board member says a male secretary wouldn't have flattered Colin Craig|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/84531305/family-first-director-bob-mccoskrie-says-colin-craigs-poetry-bad|accessdate=22 September 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September, several Conservative Party staff members including Bev Adair-Beets, Angela Storr, and Kevin Stitt disputed MacGregor's sexual harassment allegations against Craig and vouched for the accuracy of Craig's allegations in his "Dirty Politics" pamphlet. While on the stand, the plaintiff Jordan Williams denied using MacGregor for political gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Jordan Williams emotional and angry in court|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11715434|accessdate=23 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 September, lawyers representing both parties entered closing arguments. While Jordan Williams' lawyer Peter Knight cited the letters and poems as evidence of Craig's alleged sexual harassment against MacGregor, Craig's lawyer Stephen Mills [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] asserted that Craig had the right to defend himself through his "Dirty Politics" pamphlet. Mills also contended that Williams had broken MacGregor's trust by passing information on her relationship with Craig to other Conservative Party officials and [[Cameron Slater]]'s blog Whale Oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig trial: 'Jordan Williams wanted leader gone'|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11718475|accessdate=28 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig's lawyer makes final push to clear his name|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/colin-craigs-lawyer-makes-final-push-to-clear-his-name-2016092811|accessdate=28 September 2016|publisher=Newshub|date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September, the eleven-member jury unanimously ruled against Craig in Jordan Williams' favour. Craig was ordered to pay $1.3 million in compensation and punitive damages to Williams. While Williams and his supporters welcomed the decision, Craig's lawyers announced that they would appeal both the verdict and the amount of damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wade|first1=Amelia|title=Colin Craig loses defamation case, ordered to pay $1.3m damages|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11715326|accessdate=30 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bath|first1=Brooke|last2=Dennett|first2=Kelly|title=Colin Craig ruled to have defamed Jordan Williams|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/84790345/colin-craig-jury-returns-in-defamation-case|accessdate=30 September 2016|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the unanimous jury verdict and the level of damages, Craig told Radio NZ in an interview the evening of the verdict that he did not regret publicizing the pamphlet and that he 'stood by' the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/314610/no-regrets-about-sending-out-leaflet-colin-craig|title=No regrets about sending out leaflet – Colin Craig|date=30 September 2016|newspaper=Radio New Zealand|access-date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 2017, a High Court judge dismissed the awarding of $1.27 million to Jordan Williams, saying that the amount was too high and a "miscarriage of justice" had occurred. Justice Sarah Katz said that the amount, a record figure in New Zealand, meant that the jury must have concluded that Williams was successful in all of his claims, whereas he had not been, and that they must have ignored her direction to not take into account any meanings that Craig proved were true. Justice Katz directed that a retrial take place if lawyers did not file submissions on whether the court should substitute the damages award.

===Colin Craig Resigns from Party===

On 4 October 2016, Conservative Party chairman Leighton Baker confirmed that Craig had resigned his membership of the party and was not considering any leadership position within the party. Baker also confirmed that the negative publicity had also affected the party's support base and expressed doubts that the party would contest the [[New Zealand general election, 2017|2017 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Satherley|first1=Dan|title=Conservative Party doesn't want Colin Craig back|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/conservative-party-doesnt-want-colin-craig-back-2016100407|accessdate=6 October 2016|publisher=Newshub|date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2017, the Conservative Party protested its exclusion from a political debate being hosted by the [[University of Auckland]] Debating Society scheduled to be held on 9 March. The Conservative Party had initially been invited in November 2016 but the Debating Society subsequently decided to limit participation to parties which were or had previously been represented in the New Zealand Parliament due to the number of participants. The Party issued a press statement on the internet news site [[Scoop (website)|Scoop.co.nz]] accusing the Debating Society of trying to stifle diverse views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davison|first1=Isaac|title=The Conservative Party says exclusion from political debate 'unfair'|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11812439|accessdate=13 August 2017|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=University Debate Running Scared of Conservatives!|url=http://auckland.scoop.co.nz/2017/03/university-debate-running-scared-of-conservatives/|accessdate=13 August 2017|publisher=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop.co.nz]]|date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May 2017 the [[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|New Zealand Electoral Commission]] awarded the Conservative Party an allocation of $51,848.00 for use in the 2017 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elections.org.nz/parties-candidates/broadcasting/broadcasting-allocations|title=Broadcasting Allocations|work=Electoral Commission|access-date=11 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party campaigned using the slogan "hit the reset button".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativeparty.org.nz/index.php/policy/the-conservative-party-nz-is-on-the-move/|title=THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY NZ IS ON THE MOVE – Conservative Party NZ|website=www.conservativeparty.org.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 June 2017 Elliot Ikilei was announced as the Manurewa candidate and as the party's new Deputy Leader to contest the [[New Zealand general election, 2017|2017 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deputy Leader for Manurewa Candidate|url=https://www.conservativeparty.org.nz/index.php/2017/06/09/1835/|accessdate=13 August 2017|publisher=Conservative Party of New Zealand|date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has taken a [[pro-life]] stance and supports the party's policy of instituting [[Referendums in New Zealand#Citizen initiated referendums|citizen initiated referendum]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Getting Candid with ...

The Conservatives gained only 0.2% of the party vote (6,253) during the 2017 general election and failed to win a seat in Parliament.&lt;ref name="2017 general election results"&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 General Election – Official Result|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2017/|publisher=New Zealand Electoral Commission|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Conservative has an active youth wing, Young Conservative. They are "a supporting youth membership of New Conservative. We adhere to the principles and policies for which New Conservative stands".&lt;ref name="Young Conservative Website"/&gt; The youth wing puts emphasis on the three values of "Democracy, Family, and Environment". In an interview with The Wireless, it is clear Young Conservative still holds the sentiments of orthodox conservative issues, such as Same-Sex Marriage, Abortion, Identity Politics, and Affirmative action.&lt;ref name="The Wireless Interview"&gt;{{cite news |title= New Zealand's Young Conservatives |url= http://thewireless.co.nz/articles/new-zealand-s-young-conservatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
In Europe, '''positive action''' 
are measures which are targeted at protected groups in order to enable or encourage members of those groups to overcome or minimise disadvantage; or to meet the different needs of the
protected group; or to enable or encourage persons in protected groups to participate in an activity. In the United Kingdom in the [[Equality Act 2010]] ss 158-159, the term is used in the context of employment to allow selection of a candidate from an "under-represented" group, so long as he or she is no less than equally qualified compared to another potential candidate that is not from the under-represented group.

'''Potassium bromate''' (KBrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is a [[bromate]] of [[potassium]] and takes the form of white crystals or powder. It is a strong oxidizing agent.

==Preparation==
Potassium bromate is produced when [[bromine]] is passed through a hot solution of [[potassium hydroxide]]. This first forms unstable [[hypobromite|potassium hypobromite]], which quickly [[disproportionate]]s into bromide and bromate:&lt;ref name="HW1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Synthesis, Separation and Purification of KBr and KBrO|url=http://www.hwscience.com/chemistry/ap/aplab/synkbr.pdf|website=Harvard-Westlake School AP Chemistry Pre-Labs|publisher=[[Harvard-Westlake School]]|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: 3BrO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) →  2Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + {{chem|BrO|3|−}}(aq)
Electrolysis of [[potassium bromide]] solutions will also give bromate. Both processes are analogous to those used in the production of [[chlorate]]s.

Potassium bromate is readily separated from the potassium bromide present in both methods owing to its much lower solubility; when a solution containing potassium bromate and bromide is cooled to 0°C, nearly all bromate will precipitate, while nearly all of the bromide will stay in solution.{{r|HW1}}

==Uses in baking==
Potassium bromate is typically used in the United States as a [[flour]] improver ([[E number]] E924). It acts to strengthen the [[dough]] and to allow higher rising. It is an [[oxidizing agent]], and under the right conditions will be completely reacted to a form with a lower [[oxidation state]]{{clarify|reason=This used to say "completely used up" which is clearly not how chemistry works; there will be some form of bromine remaining. It would be good to find out what the bromate is reduced to and state that; it's probably bromide.|date=November 2018}} in baking the bread. However, if too much is added, or if the bread is not baked long enough or not at a high enough temperature, then a residual amount will remain, which may be harmful if consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurokawa|first=Y|last2=Maekawa|first2=A|last3=Takahashi|first3=M|last4=Hayashi|first4=Y|date=1990-07-01|title=Toxicity and carcinogenicity of potassium bromate--a new renal carcinogen.|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=87|pages=309–335|issn=0091-6765|pmc=1567851|pmid=2269236|doi=10.1289/ehp.9087309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potassium bromate might also be used in the production of [[malt]] barley, for which application the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has prescribed certain safety conditions, including labeling standards for the finished [[malt]] barley product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.730 Section 172.730 Potassium Bromate], Food Additives Permitted for Direct Addition to Food for Human Consumption, US Code of Federal Regulations, US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/ref&gt; It is a very powerful oxidizer (E° = 1.5 volts, comparable to [[potassium permanganate]]).

==Regulation==
Potassium bromate is classified as a category 2B carcinogen (possibly carcinogenic to humans) by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol73/73-17.html IARC--Summaries &amp; Evaluations: Potassium Bromate (Group 2B)], International Agency for Research on Cancer&lt;/ref&gt;

Potassium bromate has been banned from use in food products in the European Union, Argentina, Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/LEIS_2001/L10273.htm | title = Dispõe sobre o uso do bromato de potássio na farinha e nos produtos de panificação | language = Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada, Nigeria, South Korea, Peru and some other countries. It was banned in Sri Lanka in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elaw.org/news/advocate/default.asp?issue=2001-4 Bridges Across Borders], Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide&lt;/ref&gt; China in 2005,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} and India on 20 June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India bans use of cancer-causing additive, potassium bromate, in bread, other food|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-bans-use-of-cancer-causing-additive-potassium-bromate-in-bread-other-food/articleshow/52836892.cms|website=The Times of India|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States of America, it has not been banned. The FDA sanctioned the use of bromate before the [[Delaney clause]] of the [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]—which bans potentially carcinogenic substances— went into effect in 1958. But since 1991 the FDA has urged bakers to voluntarily stop using it. In [[California]] a warning label is required when bromated flour is used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oehha.ca.gov/prop65/CRNR_notices/admin_listing/intent_to_list/noilbromate.html California OEHHA Bromate Meets the Criteria for Listing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203041405/http://www.oehha.ca.gov/prop65/CRNR_notices/admin_listing/intent_to_list/noilbromate.html |date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese baked goods manufacturers stopped using potassium bromate voluntarily in 1980; however, [[Yamazaki Baking Company Limited|Yamazaki Baking]] resumed its use in 2005, claiming they had new production methods to reduce the amount of the chemical which remained in the final product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-131178476.html AsiaPulse News: Japan's Yamazaki Baking to use potassium bromate in bread]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4318">'''Preemption''' was a term used in the nineteenth century to refer to a settler's right to purchase [[Public domain (land)|public land]] at a federally set minimum price; it was a right of first refusal.  Usually this was conferred to male heads of households who developed the property into a farm.  If he was a citizen or was taking steps to become one and he and his family developed the land (buildings, fields, fences) he had the right to then buy that land for the minimum price.  Land was otherwise sold through auction, typically at a price too high for these settlers.  Preemption is similar to [[squatter's rights]] and [[Mineral rights|mining claims]].{{sfn|Ritchie|1858|pp=162-163}}

Preemption was politically controversial, primarily among land speculators and their allies in government. In the early history of the United States, and even to some degree during the colonial era, settlers were moving into the "virgin wilderness" and building homes and farms without regard to land title. The improvements increased the value of all the nearby property.{{sfn|Johnson|1951|pp=162-163}} Eventually the political opposition by the speculators crumbled and the [[Preemption Act of 1841]] was passed.

The Preemption Act of 1841 was abused by speculators who now operated as money lending businesses,{{sfn|Gates|1969|p=321}} or were able to coerce accomplices to falsely claim they were living on land that they wanted. A common example of the latter practice was in the logging industry in the upper [[Midwest]], where mill workers who lived in mill towns made a preemption claim on [[timber]] land that would then be harvested by the mill owners.{{sfn|Gates|1969|p=326}}  Another avenue of fraud was the [[Desert Land Act]], which did not include the residence requirement, although the preempting claimant still needed to improve the land, primarily by providing a water source.  In California, tens of thousands of acres of land were claimed via false preemptors – "dummy entrymen" – on behalf of several large land speculating companies.{{sfn|Gates|1978|pp=12-13}}

The Preemption Act of 1841 was pivotal, but was neither the beginning nor the end of the issue of preemption.{{sfn|Gates|1969|p=312-314}}  The [[Land Act of 1804]], the [[Homestead Act of 1862|Homestead Act]], the aforementioned Desert Land Act, and other similar land acts addressed the issue of preemption.{{sfn|Treat|1910|pp=v-vi}}

The '''Provisional Government of the Republic of China''' ({{zh|t=中華民國臨時政府|s=中华民国临时政府|p=Zhōnghuá Mínguó Línshí Zhèngfǔ|first=t}}, or {{lang-ja|Chūka Minkoku Rinji Seifu}}) was a [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Chinese]] [[puppet state]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] that existed from 1937 to 1940 during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. It had been formed largely on the initiative of [[Imperial Japanese Army]] commanders in [[north China]], before securing approval from Japanese government authorities in [[Tokyo]]. Thus the Provisional Government had nominal authority in Japanese occupied zones in north China, while to the south the [[Central China Expeditionary Army]] established the [[Reformed Government of the Republic of China]] in 1938, which had authority in the [[Yangtze River]] area. Both essentially served as a local organ of the Japanese military authorities, due to the presence and extensive powers of Japanese advisors within the Provisional Government over native Chinese bureaucrats, and because it never made any attempt to secure [[international recognition]], even from Japan.

==History==
After the conquest of [[North China|Northern China]], Japanese [[Imperial General Headquarters]] authorized the creation of a collaborationist regime as part of its overall [[North China Buffer State Strategy|strategy]] to establish an autonomous buffer zone between China and Japanese-controlled [[Manchukuo]]. Initially, this resulted in the creation of local and provincial autonomous administrations, such as the [[East Hebei Autonomous Council]]. But plans were drawn up throughout 1937 to unite all of these smaller regimes into one that would serve as a future central government of China. The Provisional Government united these smaller local councils and nominally controlled the provinces of [[Hopei]], [[Shantung]], [[Shansi]], [[Henan]] and [[Kiangsu]]. However, the regime's real influence was largely limited to where Japanese military control extended permanently, which meant its jurisdiction was in larger cities and railways. The authority of the Provisional Government was further limited by the existence of the [[Mengjiang|Inner Mongolian autonomous government]] and the continued resistance of the East Hebei Council to fully integrate.{{sfb|Jennings|1997|p=92}}{{sfb|Brune|2002|p=521}}{{sfb|Boyle|1972|pp=83–85}}{{sfb|Boyle|1972|pp=90–91}}

The Provisional Government of the Republic of China was officially inaugurated by [[Wang Kemin|Wáng Kèmǐn]], former [[Kuomintang]] Minister of Finance and [[Shanghai]] banker, on 14 December 1937, with its capital at [[Beijing]]. Wang was assisted by [[Tang Erho]], who served as chairman of the Legislative Yuan and Minister of Education. Initially Major General [[Seiichi Kita]], the head of the local Japanese special services and foremost "puppeteer" in north China on whose initiative the Provisional Government would be formed, wanted the head of state to be either [[Cao Kun]] or [[Wu Peifu]], former warlords of the [[Warlord Era|early republican period]] who had some national fame in China. But neither one took up the post because their price for collaboration was too high. In the end, the Provisional Government leadership did not include anyone of renown or fame. Many of its members were older bureaucrats whose careers spanned the early republican era (1910s and 1920s) and even the preceding [[Qing Dynasty]]. Some had picked the wrong side during the warlord era and thus were bitterly anti-Kuomintang. The difficulty that Kita and other Japanese faced in recruiting members for the puppet regime caused a delay of its formation.{{sfb|Boyle|1972|pp=88–89}}

Its activities were carefully prescribed and overseen by advisors provided by the [[Japanese Northern China Area Army]]. The failure of the Japanese to give any real authority to the Provisional Government discredited it in the eyes of the local inhabitants, and made its existence of only limited propaganda utility to the Japanese authorities.{{sfb|Black|2002|p=34}}

The Provisional Government was, along with the [[Reformed Government of the Republic of China]], merged into [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Nanjing-based [[Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China|reorganized national government]] on 30 March 1940, but in practical terms actually remained virtually independent under the name of the "North China Political Affairs Commission" ({{lang|zh-Hant|華北政務委員會}}) until the end of the war.{{sfb|Li|2007|p=166}} Many of the same members of the Provisional Government continued to serve the Japanese in north China throughout the 1940s in their original capacities.{{sfb|Boyle|1972|pp=90–91}}

== Politics ==
The main source of its sovereignty was a constitution written by an unelected committee. The internal structure of the Provisional Government was similar to the [[Kuomintang]] government of [[Chiang Kai-shek]], but in practice there was little division of power between the different branches, which were the four yuan: Executive, Legislative, Control, and Judicial (the [[Examination Yuan]]'s powers had been given to the ministry of education). The [[Control Yuan]] was abolished not long after the government was established. The [[Executive Yuan]] was given great powers at the expense of the other branches, however, such as deciding all legislation and having the [[Legislative Yuan]] (whose members were appointed by the Executive) merely rubber stamp its decisions. The Executive supervised five ministries, which did not include either a foreign affairs or military ministry, most notably (although there was a ministry of public security). The Provisional Government never made any serious attempt to secure international recognition, not even from Japan. Some representatives had been sent to Tokyo but these were more "ambassadors of goodwill" rather than officially accredited diplomats. No formal treaties or other agreements were concluded by the Provisional Government, with all negotiations done directly with the authorities of the Japanese [[North China Area Army]].{{sfb|Boyle|1972|pp=90–91}}

Its official ideology was [[Confucianism]], and it condemned the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek for destroying China with their policies. The Provisional Government took the view that the Kuomintang took unnecessarily hostile actions towards Japan, allied with the [[Soviet Union]] and the Chinese Communists, and thus ended up damaging China. The ideas of Confucianism, such as the "kingly way," were considered by the government to be antidotes to the social damage caused by [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s [[Three Principles of the People]]. As it sought to distance itself from the Chinese Nationalist principles this later brought contention with the other collaborator [[Wang Jingwei]] when negotiations occurred to bring the Provisional Government under the fold of his new [[Reorganized National Government of China]] in 1940, which portrayed itself as the legitimate heirs of the Kuomintang.{{sfb|Boyle|1972|pp=83–85}}{{sfb|Boyle|1972|pp=90–91}}{{sfb|Boyle|1972|pp=105}}

The Education Ministry and the "New People's Society" were in charge of spreading these aforementioned ideas through the usage of propaganda. The latter group had been established as the brainchild of Major General Seiichi Kita, modeled on the [[Concordia Association]] in neighboring [[Manchukuo]]. It was essentially a political organ that was designed to spread the government's ideas to the public and mobilize economic and military support for the Provisional Government and Japan. The New People's Society was not a mass organization with millions of members but a small tight-knit group that included many smaller sub-organizations. Among their activities ranged from training future civil servants, sending students to Japan, giving medical services to remote villages, providing disaster relief, establish free tea houses, promoting Chinese art and pilgrimages to Confucian temples, as well as discussing political events in their radio stations and official newspaper, the New People's Daily. The core values emphasized were Confucian virtues, familial piety, respect for authority, and devotion to scholarship. In the end, however, the organization failed to rally mass public support for the Provisional Government and Japan, being countered by the Communist Party's propaganda.{{sfb|Boyle|1972|pp=92–95}}

== Economy ==
In March 1938 the Japanese had the Provisional Government establish a "Federal Reserve Bank" with the primary intent of severing north China's financial structures from the rest of Kuomintang-controlled China, as well as to shatter the finances of the Kuomintang government by destabilizing its currency. The Provisional Government declared that the Chinese national currency used by the Nationalists could only remain in circulation for one year before its own Federal Reserve Bank notes would become the primary currency of the region. It allowed the regime to offset its lack of ability to collect tax revenues from its nominal territory, for a time. However, it was not long before mass inflation began and neither Chinese merchants nor Japanese businessmen decided to accept the new bank notes. The Kuomintang currency remained in use everywhere outside of the Japanese military's immediate reach, while [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] guerrillas operating in north China declared it illegal to possess Federal Reserve Bank notes. Also, foreign businesses operating in the port of [[Tianjin]] refused to accept the new currency. The circulation of Japanese military scrips for the purchases of local goods and the introduction of [[Bank of Japan]] [[yen]] notes also added to the confusion.{{sfb|Boyle|1972|pp=97–99}}

The trafficking of [[opium]] also played a major role in the financial activities of the Japanese military in north China. A so-called "Opium Prohibition Bureau" had been established, but it actually had the task of bringing the narcotics trade under the control of the authorities rather than suppressing it.{{sfb|Boyle|1972|pp=97–99}} Most of the major industries in north China had been placed under the control of Japanese businesses, and while a Sino-Japanese Economic Council had been established in March 1938 in [[Beijing]] with the intent of being used to resolve disputes over economic matters, in the end the final decisions regarding the economy were still made in Tokyo. Industries such as resource production (iron, coal, electricity, etc.) as well as communications and transportation had been placed in the hands of either the China Development Company, an offshoot of the [[South Manchurian Railway Company]] that was under the Japanese military's control, or major Japanese firms. However, there was little Japanese or Chinese capital attracted to such ventures in north China, and as the war went on Japan's primary emphasis was placed on resource extraction for its war effort, rather than such projects as in improving the local infrastructure.{{sfb|Boyle|1972|pp=100–103}}

== Military ==
{{main|Collaborationist Chinese Army#Provisional Government}}
The security of the Provisional Government was at first based around a 5,000-man police force. The Provisional Government Army began to be organized in May 1938 with the organization of a Japanese-run military academy in [[Tongzhou District, Beijing|Tongzhou]]. [[Non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs) began six months of training in February 1939 and the army officially formed in September 1939. At first the Army had to fill most of the officer and NCO slots with former Nationalist officers until the newly trained officers could take charge. The army's target strength was to consist of 13,200 men in eight [[infantry]] [[regiment]]s of 1,650 men each. Six of the regiments were organized in three [[brigade]]s of two regiments each and put under the command of a Chinese [[Major General]] with a Japanese advisor. In addition, a 400-man-strong bodyguard was formed to protect government officials after all of Wang Ke-min's Japanese bodyguards were assassinated. {{sfb|Jowett|2004|p=44}}

The order of battle as of September 1939 was as follows:{{sfb|Jowett|2004|p=44}}
*1st Brigade '[[Beijing]]' (Maj. Gen. Liu Fengzhi)
**1st Regiment (Peking)
**2nd Regiment (Tongzhou)
*2nd Brigade '[[Baoding]]' (Maj. Gen. Huang Nanbeng)
**3rd Regiment (Paotingfu)
**4th Regiment (Chengtingfu)
*3rd Brigade '[[Kaiping]]' (Maj. Gen. Lu Zhensheng)
**5th Regiment (Kaiping)
**6th Regiment (Tangshan)
*7th Independent Regiment '[[Tianjin]]' (Col. Sun Zhizhang)
*8th Independent Regiment '[[Jinan]]' (Col. Ma Wenzhi)

After the formation of the Nanjing Nationalist Government under Wang Jingwei, the troops that had formerly been under the Provisional Government effectively remained under the authority of the North China Political Affairs Council led by Wang Kemin. By 1940, it was reported that the local army in north China numbered some 26,000 men, which were increased to 41,000 due to a recruitment drive, organized into 22 regiments along with eight independent and training regiments. Local police forces numbered some 135,000 while local militia were around 200,000, but the latter were regarded as completely unreliable by the Japanese due to lack of training and weapons.{{sfb|Jowett|2004|pp=85–87}}

'''Relocatable user backup''' (RUB) is the ability to restore or relocate [[Backup|backups]] to another system or site. It is one of the primary ways to mitigate the threat of service-provider lock-in in a [[software as a service]] model.  It also provides a backup in the event that the [[Service provider|service-provider]] suffers a catastrophic failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9139433/Sidekick_s_lesson_Back_up_your_data_?taxonomyId=19 |title=Sidekick's lesson: Back up your data |author=Matt Hamblen |date=October 15, 2009 |publisher=Computerworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept requires 3 fundamental components :

*The user must be able to initiate and receive backups from the service provider and store them [[Hard disk drive|locally]]
*The user must be able to restore the backup to an environment other than that provided by the service provider, preferably locally
*The backup must encapsulate all content, metadata, system and application state which allow the easy restoration of the backup into a standard framework either provided and maintained by the service provider or the wider software community.

The third component also contains the implication that either the application itself is provided with the backup, or there is a consistent and ongoing application upgrade path to prevent the situation where the restore of a RUB is prevented due to an obsolete version of [[application software]].

'''''Shaw v. Reno''''', 509 U.S. 630 (1993), was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case argued on April 20, 1993. The ruling was significant in the area of [[redistricting]] and racial [[gerrymandering]]. The court ruled in a 5-4 decision that redistricting based on race must be held to a standard of [[strict scrutiny]] under the [[equal protection clause]]. On the other hand, bodies doing redistricting must be conscious of race to the extent that they must ensure compliance with the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. The redistricting that occurred after the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]], as required to reflect population changes, was the first nationwide redistricting to apply the results of ''Shaw v. Reno''.

==Decision==

===Factual background and majority opinion===
[[File:United States Congressional Districts in North Carolina, 1993 – 1998.tif|alignl|thumb|250px|North Carolina's congressional districts (1993–1998); the 12th district in pink.]]
The case involved the redistricting of [[North Carolina]] after the [[United States Census, 1990|1990 census]]. North Carolina submitted to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] a map with one [[majority-minority]] black [[North Carolina's 12th congressional district|district]]&amp;mdash;that is, a district with a black majority. The Department of Justice believed that the state could have drawn another such [[majority-minority district]] in order to improve representation of black voters rather than including them all within one district. The state revised its map and submitted a new plan, this one with two majority-minority districts. The proposed 12th district was {{convert|160|mi|km}} long, winding through the state to connect various areas having in common only a large black population.  A federal District Court dismissed a lawsuit by some North Carolina voters on the grounds that they had no claim for relief under a standard set by a previous Supreme Court case, United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh v. Carey.

Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] delivered the opinion of the Court, which reversed that of the District Court.  She described the shape of the new district as "bizarre" and said such a district "bears an uncomfortable resemblance to political [[apartheid]]."  The Court found that if a redistricting map is "so bizarre on its face that it is 'unexplainable on grounds other than race'," that a claim for relief under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] is available to plaintiffs.  Such redistricting will be held unconstitutional if it is found to be intended to segregate voters by race and this segregation cannot be justified under a standard of [[strict scrutiny]].  Actions subject to this standard must satisfy three conditions: a [[compelling government interest]], [[narrowly tailored]] to achieve that goal, and the [[least restrictive means]] for achieving that interest.

===Dissents===
The dissenters noted: 
:(1) That the case was brought by white voters challenging the district. Its boundaries had enabled the district's majority of black voters to elect the majority-white state's first black representatives to Congress since 1898, when [[George Henry White]] was re-elected to his second term in Congress from [[North Carolina's 2nd congressional district]].&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baic.house.gov/member-profiles/profile.html?intID=22#foot37 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924185616/http://baic.house.gov/member-profiles/profile.html?intID=22 |archivedate=September 24, 2008 |title=Black Americans in Congress: George Henry White |publisher=US House of Representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1899, after North Carolina Democrats passed a new state constitution to disenfranchise blacks, White chose not to seek a third term in Congress. He told the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', "I cannot live in North Carolina and be a man and be treated as a man." He moved to Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;)
:(2) that the holding citing the 14th Amendment perversely made redistricting that advantaged blacks subject to more rigorous scrutiny than redistricting advantaging other non-racial groups, though the 14th amendment was intended to provide for equal protection for blacks after emancipation and abolition of slavery, and; 
:(3) that allowing race-based voting blocs is distinct from other forms of [[affirmative action]], insofar as allowing race-based blocs does not deny another person her rights and privileges, as for example, race-based hiring and retention practices do.

===Impact===
Subsequent decisions on similar issues have made use of ''Shaw'' and refined it, though the four dissenters have held fast in their belief that no cause of action exists. For instance, ''[[Miller v. Johnson]],'' {{ussc|515|900|1995}}, which concerned a similarly irregular district in Georgia, was also decided 5-4, with the majority comprising exactly the same five justices as in ''Shaw''.

[[Physical fitness]] is maintained by a range of physical activities. Physical activity is defined by the World Health Organization as "any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/topics/physical_activity/en/|title = World Health Organization|date = |accessdate = 2015-04-16|website = World Health Organization|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human factors and [[social influences]] are important in starting and maintaining such activities. Social environments can influence motivation and persistence, through pressures towards social conformity.

Obesity is a physical marker of poor health, increasing the likelihood of [[Obesity-associated morbidity|various diseases]].&lt;ref name=HaslamJames&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haslam DW, James WP |title=Obesity |journal=Lancet |volume=366 |issue=9492 |pages=1197–209 |year=2005 |pmid=16198769 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67483-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[social constructs]] surrounding health, the belief that being skinny is healthy and discrimination against those perceived to be 'unhealthy',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Obesity Stigma: Important Considerations for Public Health|last = Puhl, Heuer|first = Rebecca M, Chelsea A|date = June 2010|journal = American Journal of Public Health|doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2009.159491|pmid = 20075322|pmc=2866597|volume=100|pages=1019–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; people who are considered overweight or obese on the BMI scale face many social challenges. Challenges can range from basic things such as buying clothes, pressure from society to change their body, and being unable to get a job. This can lead to various problems such as eating disorders, self-esteem issues, and misdiagnosis and improper treatment of physical ailments due to discrimination.

===Adult===
Obesity has become a serious health risk throughout the developed world.&lt;ref name = WHOfactsheet&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/media/en/gsfs_obesity.pdf | title=OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT | publisher=World Health Organization | accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1 billion adults are overweight, and more than 300 million of them are clinically obese.&lt;ref name = WHOfactsheet/&gt;
Furthermore, 40% of adults in the United States in 1997 reported engaging in no physical activity, while 59% do not engage in vigorous leisure-time physical activity. Although these percentages and occurrences of inactivity among older adults may vary by racial and ethnic group, and by gender, it's stated that inactivity appears, "From 47 percent among woman age 75 and older to 59 percent in older black males and 61 percent in older black females" (Hughes et al. 55).

===Children===
Nearly one in five children in the United States are overweight. Ogden et al., studied 3,958 children and adolescents between the ages of 2–19 from 2003–2004.&lt;ref name="Ogden06"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogden | first1 = C.L. | last2 = Carroll | first2 = M.D. | last3 = Curtin | first3 = L.R. | last4 = McDowell | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Tabak | first5 = C.J. | last6 = Flegal | first6 = K.M. | year = 2006 | title = Prevalence of overweight and obesity in the United States, 1999–2004 | url = | journal = The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 295 | issue = | pages = 1549–1551 | doi=10.1001/jama.295.13.1549 | pmid=16595758}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was a part of the NHANES which is the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. It showed that 17.1% of the 3,958 children were overweight, with over 35% percent of children ages 6–19 being seriously overweight.&lt;ref name="Ogden06"/&gt; Ogden et al., had results showing 37.4% of this group was considered to be seriously overweight. Another age range where there are a high percentage of children who are overweight, are the range from 6–11. Ogden et al., was a study which was conducted in 2003–2004. The data collected was arranged into different age ranges. It showed that 18.8% of children ages 6–11 are overweight.&lt;ref name="Ogden06"/&gt; Research has shown that obesity in children has increased from 1999 to 2004. The 1999 study showed that 28.2% of children from the ages of 2–19 were overweight. In the 2004 study, that amount was 33.6%. The age range that was the most affected was children from the ages of 6–11, for which the percentage rose 7.4 points from 29.8% to 37.2%.&lt;ref name="Ogden06"/&gt;

Obesity can be responsible for lowering an individual's views on themselves as well as their self-respect. Sweeting et al., conducted a test on children ages 11–15.&lt;ref name="Sweeting05"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sweeting | first1 = H. | last2 = Wright | first2 = C. | last3 = Minnis | first3 = H. | year = 2005 | title = Psychosocial correlates of adolescent obesity, 'slimming down' and 'becoming obese.' | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 37 | issue = | page = 409 | doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2005.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2,127 students were surveyed on who was obese, who needed to slim down, and who was becoming obese. Of these students, 9.6% of males and 10.5% of females were considered obese at age 11. At age 15 10.5% of males and 11.6% of females were obese. 3.5% of the total students surveyed needed to slim down and 4.5% are becoming obese. The test revealed that obesity has a great effect on changing moods and lowering of self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Sweeting05"/&gt;

Inactivity is one of the biggest reasons for obesity in children. Berkey et al., conducted a study on 11,887 children from the ages of 10–15 to test whether or not an increase in a person's activity level would reduce a person's body fat.&lt;ref name="Berkey03"&gt;Berkey, C.S., Rockett, H.R., Gillman, M.W., Colditz, G.A. (2003). One year changes in Activity and in Inactivity among 10- to 15-year-old boys and girls: relationship to change in body mass index. ''Pediatrics'', 111(4), 836. Retrieved December 12th from ebscohost database.&lt;/ref&gt; A test done on girls concluded that an increase in physical activity brought their [[body mass index]] (BMI) down .11. The male test resulted in a .33 decrease in their BMI. An increase of inactivity showed an increase in BMI for girls by .02.&lt;ref name="Berkey03"/&gt; A way to improve this inactivity would be by changing a child's daily physical regime. Switching an overweight child's daily physical activity could help a child lose weight and get into better physical condition. Rodearmel et al., studied a couple of Latino families who had at least one child between the ages of 7–14.&lt;ref name="Rodearmel07"&gt;Rodearmel, S.J., Wyatt, H.R., Stroebele, N., Smith, S.M., Ogden, L.G., Hill, J.O. (2007). Small changes in dietary sugar and physical activity as an approach to preventing excessive weight gain: the America on the move family study. ''Pediatrics'', 120(4), e869. Retrieved December 12th from ebscohost database.&lt;/ref&gt; This was done over a 6-month span. There were two groups that the children were put into. The first group was the "America on the Move" group and the other group was the "self monitor only" group. The America on the Move group had to walk an additional 2,000 steps per day from their baseline which was already measured through pedometers and to eliminate 100 kcal/day from their normal diet by replacing dietary sugar with no caloric sweetener. The self monitor group did not have to change their physical activity or their diet. This group only had to record their physical activity with pedometers. Both groups had results showing they had decreased their BMIs with the America on the Move group decreasing their BMI much more significantly.&lt;ref name="Rodearmel07"/&gt;

==Reasons for inactivity==
In the West, there is a high prevalence of overweight and obese children and adults. In the U.S.A., only 26% of adults engage in vigorous leisure-time activity (which includes a sport) or exercising three or more times per week. In an effort to increase adult involvement and decrease the percentage of adult inactivity, the US Department of Health and Human Services has set a national health objective for 2010 that hopes to "Reduce the prevalence of no leisure time activity from more than 25 percent to 20 percent of US adults" (Berlin, Storti, and Brach 1137). In Australia, the Australian Bureau of Statistics found that in 2011/12 adults spent an average of 33 minutes per day doing physical activity with 60% of the population doing less than 30 minutes and fewer than 20% doing an hour or more per day on average. The survey also showed almost 30% of the adult population reporting more than five hours of sedentary leisure activity each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4364.0.55.004Chapter4002011-12|title = Australian Bureau of Statistics|date = 2013-07-18|accessdate = 2015-04-16|website = Australian Bureau of Statistics|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inactivity can contribute to a range of health related problems including: obesity, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and other disorders. Researches have shown, "49 percent of heart disease in sedentary patients is due to lack of exercise" (Perkins, Whitehead, Steptoe 725) and the relative risk of metabolic syndrome was, "1.7 (95% CI 0.9–2.8) for lack of exercise, 1.5 (95% CI 1.1–2.1) for a positive family history and 2.0 (95% CI 1.2–3.4) in individuals with none or only an elementary school education versus university graduation" (Lee et al. 48).

Inactivity in young people has been seen to be rising in recent years, and the prevalence of sedentary leisure activities for children is significant. Video games and the internet may play a part in this. It has been found that "26 percent of children and adolescents in the United States spend more than four hours a day watching television, and they have become even more sedentary with access to computers and video games" (Damlo 1434). Along with, "62 percent of children nine to thirteen years of age do not participate in organized physical activities, and 23 percent do not participate in non-organized physical activities outside of school hours" (1434).

There may be many reasons why people may remain inactive. One reason may be due to laziness. Individuals completed a Physical Activity Questionnaire and research showed "Over one third (34 percent) of female and 12 percent of male adolescents had no leisure physical activity during a one-week period. Self-efficacy was found to have the highest correlation to leisure physical activity among all selected determinants, while 'laziness' had the highest correlation among perceived barriers" (Analysis). Along with the questionnaire other research suggested that fitness groups and fitness programs positively altered the exercise behavior of families and youths.

Another reason for physical inactivity is the perception by populations that there is nowhere safe to do so. As cities become more populated, the increased need for housing overtakes the desire for parks, cycle and walk ways therefore increasing the amount of physical inactivity in the population. Ways that can help increase the amount of physical activity is to plan and build the environment in a way that makes the population of the community feel safe to be physically active in the area. This could be done for example by slowing speed limits to safer speeds and providing safe street crossings and also by building infrastructure close to the street and pathways with safe pedestrian and cycle access and safe bike parking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ac.els-cdn.com/S149940460660211X/1-s2.0-S149940460660211X-main.pdf?_tid=557c0eb6-e426-11e4-bf44-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1429181582_7ab13abe8c50641d83cb170efe11af8b|title = Battling America's Epidemic of Physical Inactivity: Building More Walkable, Livable Communities|last = Fenton|first = Mark|date = December 2005|journal = Journal of Nutrition Education and Behaviour|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; By implementing these simple changes into communities, the residents will have an increased feel in security and therefore increase their daily physical activity.

==Initiatives==
Given the social and economic costs of low levels of physical activity there have been a number of public policy initiatives to raise the level, particularly focusing on children and adolescents.

===Fitness portal===
United States government agencies, at both Federal and State levels, have initiated a number of programs which include encouraging workers to bike to work rather than to drive. The Fitness Portal provides a range of tools, examples, and case studies of organization ideas. A few examples given by the Fitness Portal include: using the push mower, going for a walk, taking the stairs instead of an elevator, biking, running errands, visiting friends, cleaning out the garage or the attic, volunteering to become a coach or referee, signing up for a group exercise class, joining a softball league, or parking at the farthest end of the parking lot. For children they suggest: taking a dog for a walk, starting up a kickball game, joining a sports team, going to the park, helping their parents with yard work, playing tag, riding their bike to school, walking to the store, seeing how many jumping jacks they can do, or racing a friend to the end of the block.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fitness.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wellness On Wheels===
The Wear Valley District Council along with its local Durham Dales Primary Care Trust in England developed an innovative scheme in an effort to combat the high levels of poor health and obesity in the area. They created a mobile gym with electronic fitness monitoring equipment, which is called "WOW" (Wellness on Wheels). This effort was to persuade as many people as possible to enroll in regular workouts as part of a wider campaign in the district. Barry Nelson, a health editor for the ''Northern Echo'', in an interview noted a high level of interest generated. The strategy was to take exercise to people's homes rather than waiting for them to use existing leisure facilities. Children and adults, who otherwise wouldn't have exercised, came out to exercise in the mobile gym. Clearly, from this instance, the availability and nearness of a fitness program in a community positively affected the fitness behavior of the residents. As history explains, twenty-three years ago, Mr. Hackleman was named benefits manager. At this time the county had just three health and fitness programs: blood pressure screenings performed by public health nurses, a tennis tournament and some aerobics classes. However, soon after the roster grew to include at least five preventive health screening programs, eight healthy lifestyle and wellness programs, twelve health improvement and risk reduction programs and five family-life education programs. Finally in 2005, Ms. Gibson documented a total of 3,382 participants in the county's health and fitness programs, or 2,283 individuals, representing 41% of the county's population.

===Walking School Bus===
Most research that defends the idea of fitness programs increasing exercise practices among children and adults stems out of San Diego. Heritage Elementary school implemented its first walking school bus. This initiative had students walking to their designated stops, but not waiting for the school bus. Rather, waiting for a train of people on foot to pick them up. This allowed the students to walk to school with their peers. Although it is not directly stated, a major reason children choose to walk is because they fall victim to [[mob mentality]]. Perhaps the phrase, "fall victim to mob mentality" has a negative connotation, but that is, in essence, what the children do. Because so many other students were walking, all joined in. In this instance, mob mentality and mass behavior have a positive influence on fitness behavior, and encourage the students to exercise. The opinion of children, teachers and volunteers has been in general very favorable toward the project. Research states, "91.4 percent of participating students stated they liked the initiative very much and 87.4 percent among them prefer to go to school by the Piedibus than by any other means. Teacher and volunteers outlined the social value of the project and the increase in physical activity as positive aspects of the project". The group environment of the [[walking bus]] provides comfort in exercising, which in turn leads children to exercise more often. Although not exactly identical to the "Forrest Gump phenomenon", this walking school bus exhibits the same results: "If I can do it, you can do it".

===Video games===
Several [[video game]] companies have developed ways to mix the two spectrums of electronic and exercise. [[Dance Dance Revolution]], perhaps the most well-known exercise game, had players earn points by dancing to a beat. Players earn more points for tapping dance pads on the dancing platform at precise times and in proper sequences, thereby incorporating physical exercise.

In 2006 [[Nintendo]] introduced the [[Wii]], a next generation [[game console]] the features a motion sensitive controller. Many players have noticed the benefits of increased physical activity due to playing games on the Wii system, but that does not count as serious exercise.

== Sedentary Behaviour ==
According to Biddle (2007) the social influence of technology, such as electronic gaming and screen time are the main causes towards actions of sedentary behaviour, with TV viewing and computer use being the most prevalent benefactors. However, sedentary behaviours, are not simply “opposites” of physical activity, but instead suggests that they "displace time that would otherwise be used for physical activity". (Biddle, 2007)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sedentary behaviour|last = Biddle|first = |date = 2007|journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine|doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2007.08.002|pmid = |access-date = |volume=33 |pages=502–504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children and adolescents, are deemed most at risk for these sedentary behaviours with estimates for youth TV viewing being around "1.8 - 2.8 hours per day". Also Biddle (2007) states that for young people "television took up 40% of the time spent in the five most prevalent sedentary behaviours during the week and 37% at weekends" which stresses the negative impact of these social and technological advances on physical activity and fitness behaviour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The study Hardy, Dobbins, Booth, Denney, Wilson and Okely (2006) stated that, "there are powerful societal inducements to be inactive and there are increasing concerns of an emerging preference among young people to adopt sedentary lifestyles." Based on Australian adolescents, results were received which indicated that many young people are engaging in sedentary behaviour, with grade 6's spending 34 hours per week, grade 8's with 41 hours and grade 10's with 45 hours. (Hardy et al., 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sedentary behaviours among Australian adolesents|last = |first = |date = 2006|journal = Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-842X.2006.tb00782.x|pmid = |access-date = |volume=30 |pages=534–540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study Zimmit (2010), found a strong, positive association between sedentary behaviours, in particular TV viewing, with obesity and low participation levels. The study stated that in the last 20 years (1990-2010), the prevalence of obesity in Australia has more than doubled. It stresses "public health initiatives targeting the reduction of sedentary pursuits may be necessary to curb the obesity epidemic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Obesity in Australia: People, politics and prevention|last = Zimmit|first = |date = 2010|journal = Obesity Research|doi = 10.1016/j.orcp.2010.09.168|pmid = |access-date = |volume=4 |pages=S86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the study Martínez-González, Alfredo Martínez, Hu, Gibney, &amp; Kearney, (1999) "Obesity is the most prevalent nutrition-related problem in Western societies, and it is associated with an important burden of suffering in terms of mortality, morbidity and psychological stress". The study stresses that people suffering from obesity place a severe burden on health care systems, and that obesity could become the leading public health problem in the next century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Physical inactivity, sedentary lifestyle and obesity in the European union.|last = |first = |date = 1999|journal = International Journal of Obesity|doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0801049|pmid = |access-date = |volume=23 |pages=1192–1201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social market economy was designed to be a [[third way]] between ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[economic liberalism]] and [[socialist economics]].{{sfn|Abelshauser|2004|p=89-93}} It was strongly inspired by [[ordoliberalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nils Goldschmidt, Hermann Rauchenschwandtner|title=The Philosophy of Social Market Economy: Michel Foucault's Analysis of Ordoliberalism|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10419/4374|accessdate=16 March 2013|year=2007|publisher=Universität Freiburg, Freiburger Diskussionspapiere zur Ordnungsökonomik}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social democracy|social democratic ideas]] and the political ideology of [[Christian democracy]], or more generally the tradition of [[Christian ethics]].&lt;ref name="Lamberts1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamberts|first=Emiel|title=Christian Democracy in the European Union, 1945/1995: Proceedings of the Leuven Colloquium, 15-18 November 1995|year=1997|publisher=Leuven University Press|language=English|isbn=9789061868088|page=478}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Abelshauser|2004|p=89-93}} The social market economy refrains from attempts to plan and guide production, the workforce, or sales, but it does support planned efforts to influence the economy through the organic means of a comprehensive economic policy coupled with flexible adaptation to market studies. Combining monetary, credit, trade, tax, customs, investment and social policies as well as other measures, this type of economic policy aims to create an economy that serves the welfare and needs of the entire population, thereby fulfilling its ultimate goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/docpage.cfm?docpage_id=3415|title=GHDI – Document – Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "social" segment is often wrongly confused with [[socialism]] and [[democratic socialism]] and although aspects were inspired by the latter the social market approach rejects the socialist ideas of replacing [[private property]] and markets with [[social ownership]] and [[economic planning]]. The "social" element to the model instead refers to support for the provision of [[equal opportunity]] and protection of those unable to enter the free market labor force because of old-age, disability, or unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.kas.de/upload/dokumente/2010/06/60_Years_SME/marktanner.pdf | title=Addressing the Marketing Problem o f the Social Market Economy | author=Marcus Marktanner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the social market economy model evolved from [[ordoliberalism]], this concept was not identical with the conception of the [[Freiburg School]] as it emphasized the state's responsibility actively to improve the market condition and simultaneously to pursue a social balance. In contrast to [[Walter Eucken]], who sought an answer to the social question by establishing a functioning competitive order within a constitutional framework, [[Alfred Müller-Armack]] conceived the social market economy as a regulatory policy idea aiming to combine free enterprise with a social programme that is underpinned by market economic performance.&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Armack, A., ''Soziale Marktwirtschaft – Handwörterbuch der Sozialwissenschaften'', vol. 9, Göttingen, 1956, p. 390; Idem, Wirtschaftsordnung und Wirtschaftspolitik, Studien und Konzepte zur Sozialen Marktwirtschaft und zur Europäischen Integration, Freiburg im Breisgau, 1966, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; In putting social policy on par with economic policy, Müller-Armack's concept was more emphatic regarding socio-political aims than the ordoliberal economic concept. This dual principle also appeared in the name of the model. Although the adjective "social" often attracted criticism as a decorative fig leaf or conversely as a gateway for antiliberal interventionism,&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, F. A. v., "Was ist und was heisst 'sozial'?", in: Hunold, A. (ed.), ''Masse und Demokratie'', Erlenbach-Zurich/ Stuttgart, 1957, pp. 71 ff. See also the contributions of Wünsche, H. F., Welcher Marktwirtschaft gebührt das Beiwort "sozial"? and Wartin, C., Zur sozialen Dimension marktwirtschaftlicher Ordnungen, in: Hohmann, K.; Schönwitz, D.; Weber, H. J.; Wünsche, H. F. (eds.), Grundtexte zur Sozialen Marktwirtschaft, Band 2, Das Soziale in der Sozialen Marktwirtschaft, Stuttgart/New York, 1988, pp. 21-31, and pp. 411-415.&lt;/ref&gt; it meant more than simply distinguishing the concept from that of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism on the one side and of ordoliberal conceptions on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, A. J., The Bonn Republic – West German Democracy 1945–1990, London/ New York, 1997, pp. 59 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In drawing on [[Wilhelm Röpke]]'s anthropo-sociological approach of an economic humanism leading to a ''Civitas Humana'',&lt;ref&gt;Röpke, W., Civitas Humana – Grundfragen der Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsordnung, Erlenbach-Zürich, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; Müller-Armack pursued a "Social Humanism" or "Social Irenics"—the notion "irenics" derives from the Greek word ''εἰρήνη ''(eirēnē), which means being conducive to or working toward peace, moderation or conciliation—to overcome existing differences in society. Therefore, the social market economy as an extension of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] thought was not a defined economic order, but a holistic conception pursuing a complete humanistic societal order as a synthesis of seemingly conflicting objectives, namely economic freedom and social security.&lt;ref name="Müller-Armack, A. 1971, pp. 50"&gt;Müller-Armack, A., Auf dem Weg nach Europa. Erinnerungen und Ausblicke, Tübingen/ Stuttgart, 1971, pp. 50 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This socio-economic imperative actively managed by a strong state—in contrast to the ordoliberal minimal state solely safeguarding the economic order&lt;ref&gt;In regard to the different conceptions of the state see the study Lange-von Kulessa, J.; Renner, A., Die Soziale Marktwirtschaft Alfred Müller-Armacks und der Ordoliberalismus der Freiburger Schule – Zur Unvereinbarkeit zweier Staatsauffassungen, in: ORDO 49, Stuttgart, 1998, pp. 79-104.&lt;/ref&gt;—is often labelled by the ambiguous but historical term ''Der Dritte Weg'' ("The Third Way").

The concept of the social market economy received fundamental impulses from reflection and critique of historical economic and social orders, namely Smithian ''laissez-faire'' liberalism on the one hand and Marxian socialism on the other. Furthermore, various [[Third Way]] conceptions prepared the ground for the socio-economic concept. Already in the late 19th century, the ''Kathedersozialisten'' ("Catheder Socialists") engaged in social reforms in the ''Verein für Socialpolitik'', turning away from pure liberalism to demand a purposive state policy designed to regulate economic life and advocating a middle course between anarchic individualism, traditionalistic corporatism and bureaucratic etatism.&lt;ref&gt;Nipperdey, Th., Deutsche Geschichte 1866–1918. Erster Band: Arbeitswelt und Bürgergeist, Munich 1993, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the Frankfurt sociologist and economist [[Franz Oppenheimer]] postulated a so-called liberal socialism (i.e. socialism achieved via liberalism) as the pursuit of a societal order in which economic self-interest preserves its power and persists in free competition.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, F., System der Soziologie (III/1). Band 3: Theorie der reinen und politischen Ökonomie, Teil 1: Grundlagen, Jena, 1910, p. 9. The economist Franz Oppenheimer (1864–1943) also published his economic conception in ''Sprung über ein Jahrhundert'', Bern/ Leipzig, 1935 under the pseudonym F. D. Pelton.&lt;/ref&gt; This desirable order of freedom and equality was labelled by a later programmatic publication entitled ''Weder so – noch so. Der dritte Weg'' (''Neither thus, nor thus. The third way'').&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, F., Weder so – noch so. Der dritte Weg, Potsdam, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

This position was widely shared by Oppenheimer's doctoral student and friend [[Ludwig Erhard]],&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer supervised Erhard's doctoral thesis titled 'Wesen und Inhalt der Werteinheit', namely a study on various historical schools' perception of character and content of value, in the years 1922 to 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; though the latter displaced adjective and subject by promoting a [[social liberalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., Franz Oppenheimer, dem Lehrer und Freund (1964), in: Hohmann, K. (ed.), Ludwig Erhard. Gedanken aus fünf Jahrzehnten, Reden und Schriften, Düsseldorf/ Vienna/ New York, 1988b, p. 861.&lt;/ref&gt; and never liked the expression Third Way.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the influence of Oppenheimer on Erhard, see Wünsche, H. F., Der Einfluss Oppenheimers auf Erhard und dessen Konzeption von der Sozialen Marktwirtschaft, in: Caspari, V.; Schefold, B. (eds.), Franz Oppenheimer und Adolph Lowe, Zwei Wirtschaftswissenschaftler der Frankfurter Universität, Marburg, 1996, pp. 141-161; Haselbach, D., Franz Oppenheimer's Theory of Capitalism and of a Third Path, in: Koslowski, P. (ed.), The Theory of Capitalism in the German Economic Tradition. Historism, Ordo-Liberalism, Critical Theory, Solidarism, Berlin et al., 2000, pp. 54-86.&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, the term was tainted, reminding him too much about ideas of a mixed economy, somewhere between a market economy and central planning. He vehemently and consistently argued against the view that models were converging.&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., Wirtschaft und Bildung (17 Aug 1957), reprinted in: Hohmann, K. (ed.), l.c., 1988b, p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further in contrast to Müller-Armack who emphasised the social aspect, for Erhard the social market economy was always first and foremost a market economic system.&lt;ref&gt;Comparative study Goldschmidt, N., Alfred Müller-Armack and Ludwig Erhard: Social Market Liberalism, in: CREPHE-CREA Histoire du Liberalisme en Europe, Brochure no. 21, Paris, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; By proclaiming "the freer an economy is, the more social it is",&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., Wirken und Reden, Ludwigsburg, 1966, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Erhard once told [[Friedrich Hayek]] that the free market economy did not need to be made social, but that it was social in its origin.&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Hayek, ''The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism'' (University of Chicago Press, 1991), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Erhard was rather inclined to Walter Eucken's ordoliberal competitive market order. Although he even considered himself an ordoliberal,&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., Deutsche Wirtschaftspolitik – Der Weg der Sozialen Marktwirtschaft, Düsseldorf/Vienna/New York/Moscow, 1992 (originally published in 1962), p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Erhard based his economic conception neither on Eucken nor on Müller-Armack. In fact, his doctoral supervisor Oppenheimer and especially Röpke, like Erhard a student of Oppenheimer, was his source of inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, A. J., l.c., 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Erhard perceived Röpke's books as works of revelation and considered the economist a brother in spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Hentschel, V., Ludwig Erhard – Ein Politikerleben, Berlin, 1998, pp. 75-78.&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 August 1948, Erhard referred to Müller-Armack by whom he was strongly impressed most of all not as a theorist, but instead as one who wanted to transfer theory into practice&lt;ref name="Hentschel, V. 1998, p. 25"&gt;Hentschel, V., Ludwig Erhard – Ein Politikerleben, Berlin, 1998, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and his concept of the social market economy. Soon after, at the second party congress of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] in the British zone in Recklinghausen on 28 August 1948, Erhard circumscribed the concept as a "socially committed market economy".&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., Marktwirtschaft im Streit der Meinungen, printed in: Erhard, L., Deutsche Wirtschaftspolitik – Der Weg der Sozialen Marktwirtschaft, Düsseldorf/ Vienna/ New York/ Moscow, 1992, p. 70. Finally, Erhard used and described the term in an article in the Berliner Tagesspiegel on 23 April 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas most neoliberal economists viewed the concept not only as an economic path between the Scylla of an untamed pure ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and the Charybdis of a collectivist planned economy, but also as a holistic and democratic social order, Erhard and in particular Müller-Armack emphasised public acceptance and civic engagement as prerequisites for the success of the socio-economic model.&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Armack, A., The Social Market Economy as an Economic and Social Order, in: Review of Social Economy 36, Washington, D.C., 1978, pp. 326 f.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Müller-Armack stressed that by "more socialism" he meant the social engagement for and with the people.&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Armack, A., Religion und Wirtschaft, Bern/ Stuttgart, 1950, pp. 559 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, Erhard pointed out that the principles of the social market economy could only be achieved if the public was determined to give them priority.&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., Wohlstand für alle, Gütersloh, 1963, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important figures in the development of the concept include Eucken, Röpke, [[Alexander Rüstow]], [[Franz Böhm]], Oppenheimer, Erhard, [[Constantin von Dietze]] and Müller-Armack, who originally coined the term ''Soziale Marktwirtschaft''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Friedrich, Carl J.|year=1955|title=The Political Thought of Neo-Liberalism|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=49|issue=2|pages=509–525|doi=10.2307/1951819|jstor=1951819|publisher=American Political Science Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; They share an involvement in the Anti-Nazi Opposition, whose search for a post-Nazi order for Germany is an important background for the development of this concept. Early protagonists had close contacts to the oppositional church-movement [[Bekennende Kirche]] and [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] and emphasized the reference of their concept to Catholic and Protestant social ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Blumenthal-Lampe: Das wirtschaftspolitische Programm der Freiburger Kreise: Entwurf einer freiheitlich-sozialen Nachkriegswirtschaft, Berlin 1973; Harald Jung: Soziale Marktwirtschaft und weltliche Ordnung, Berlin 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rhine capitalism ===
[[Michel Albert]] described a similar concept, "Rhine capitalism". He compared the so-called "neo-American model" of a capitalistic market economy introduced by the administrations of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] with what he called Rhine capitalism, present in Germany, France and in some of the Northern European economies.

While the neo-American model builds largely on the ideas of [[Friedrich Hayek|Friedrich von Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]], Rhine capitalism according to Albert has its foundations on publicly organized [[social security]]. Albert analyzes the Rhenish model as the more equitable, efficient and less violent one. However, according to Albert complex psychological phenomena and the functioning of the press lets the American model appear more attractive and dynamic to the general public.&lt;ref name="Albert1993"&gt;Michel Albert. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dBDsAAAAMAAJ Capitalism Against Capitalism]''. Whurr; 1993. {{ISBN|978-1-870332-54-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social capitalism model ===
Social capitalism as a theory or political or philosophical stance challenges the idea that the capitalist system is inherently antagonistic to social goals or to a political economy characterized by greater economic equality.&lt;ref name="Hill2010" /&gt; The essence of the social market economy is the view that private markets are the most effective allocation mechanism, but that output is maximized through sound state macroeconomic management of the economy. Social market economies posit that a strong social support network for the less affluent enhances capital output. By decreasing poverty and broadening prosperity to a large middle class, capital market participation is enlarged. Social market economies also posit that government regulation and even sponsorship of markets can lead to superior economic outcomes as evidenced in government sponsorship of the Internet or basic securities regulation.

=== Main elements ===
The main elements of the social market economy in Germany are the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanherzoginstitut.de/uploads/tx_mspublication/Enste-Soziale_Marktwirtschaft_aus_ordnungspolitischer_Sicht.pdf Roman Herzog Institute: Social Market Economy in Germany] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224125722/http://www.romanherzoginstitut.de/uploads/tx_mspublication/Enste-Soziale_Marktwirtschaft_aus_ordnungspolitischer_Sicht.pdf |date=2011-02-24 }} (german)&lt;/ref&gt;

* The social market contains central elements of a free market economy such as private property, free foreign trade, exchange of goods and free formation of prices.
* In contrast to the situation in a free market economy, the state is not passive and actively implements [[Regulation|regulative]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpb.de/popup/popup_lemmata.html?guid=Y0VZ7J keyword "social market economy" = “Soziale Marktwirtschaft”] Duden Wirtschaft von A bis Z. Grundlagenwissen für Schule und Studium, Beruf und Alltag. 2. Aufl. Mannheim: Bibliographisches Institut &amp; F.A. Brockhaus 2004. Lizenzausgabe Bonn: Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Some elements such as [[Pension#Germany|pension insurance]], [[Universal health care#Germany|universal health care]] and [[unemployment insurance]] are part of the social security system. These insurances are funded by a combination of employee contributions, employer contributions and government subsidies. The social policy objectives include employment, housing and education policies as well as a socio-politically motivated balancing of the distribution of income growth. In addition, there are provisions to restrain the free market (e.g. anti-trust code, laws against the abuse of market power and so on). These elements help to diminish many of the occurring problems of a free market economy.&lt;ref&gt;Gabler Wirtschaftslexikon: [http://wirtschaftslexikon.gabler.de/Definition/soziale-marktwirtschaft.html Eintrag: keyword "social market economy" = Soziale Marktwirtschaft]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The social market economy was born and formed in times of severe economic, but equally socio-political crises. Its conceptual architecture was set by particular historical experiences and political prerequisites: Germany's preoccupation with the social question since the late 19th century, the criticism of liberal capitalism triggered by the world economic crisis of the early 1930s and a pronounced anti-[[totalitarianism]] as well as anti-[[collectivism]] formed by the experiences of the [[Third Reich]]. These led to the eventual development of the social market economy as a viable socio-political and economic alternative between the extremes of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalism and the collectivist [[planned economy]] not as a compromise, but as a combination of seemingly conflicting objectives namely greater state provision for social security and the preservation of individual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Glossner, C. L.; Gregosz, D., The Formation and Implementation of the Social Market Economy by Alfred Müller-Armack and Ludwig Erhard, Sankt Augustin/Berlin, 2011, S. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major factors for the emergence of the German model of capitalism was to ameliorate the conditions of workers under capitalism and thus to stave off the threat of [[Karl Marx]]'s militant socialist movement. Germany implemented the world's first welfare state and universal healthcare program in the 1880s. Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] developed a program in which industry and state work closely to stimulate economic growth by giving workers greater security. To trump the militant socialists, Bismarck gave workers a corporate status in the legal and political structures of the [[German Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;E. P. Hennock. "Social Policy under the Empire: Myths and Evidence" ''German History'' 1998 16(1): 58–74; Herman Beck, ''The Origins of the Authoritarian Welfare State in Prussia. Conservatives, Bureaucracy, and the Social Question, 1815–70''. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1884, Bismarck declared:

{{quote|The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unfit to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, left to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic B. M. Hollyday, ''Bismarck'' (1970) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bismarck's program centered squarely on providing universal social insurance programs designed to increase productivity and focus the political attentions of the German workers on supporting [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]]. The program included universal healthcare, compulsory education, sickness insurance, accident insurance, disability insurance and a retirement pension, none of which were then in existence to any great degree anywhere else in the world.

After the collapse of the totalitarian Third Reich with its statist and corporatist economic policy, economists and academics at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau in Germany advocated a neoliberal or new liberal and socio-economic order. In this context, it is important to distinguish between the [[Ordoliberalism|ordoliberal]] [[Freiburg School]] (or Freiburg School of Law and Economics) and the [[Freiburg Circles]]. Frequently, the two schools of thought were believed to be the same,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Götz, H. H., Die geistigen Väter der sozialen Marktwirtschaft, in: Eick, J. (ed.), So nutzt man den Wirtschaftsteil einer Tageszeitung, Frankfurt am Main, 1971, pp. 57-61 or Rieter, H.; Schmolz, M., The Ideas of German Ordoliberalism 1938–1945: Pointing the Way to a New Economic Order, in: The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought 1, London, 1993, pp. 87-114.&lt;/ref&gt; although the first emerged from the latter and among the members of the Freiburg School only the founders [[Walter Eucken]] and [[Franz Böhm]] belonged to the Freiburg Circles and conversely no member of the Freiburg Circles can be attributed to the Freiburg School, which partly advocated different economic objectives. Both schools of economic thought considered that a certain form of planning was necessary for a transitional period following the war. However, whereas the pivotal members of the Freiburg Circles, [[Erwin von Beckerath]], [[Adolf Lampe]] and [[:de:Jens Jessen|Jens Jessen]], favoured productive governmental intervention, i.e. an economy regulated by a relatively strong state,&lt;ref&gt;Blumenberg-Lampe, C. (ed.), Der Weg in die Soziale Marktwirtschaft: Referate, Protokolle, Gutachten der Arbeitsgemeinschaft Erwin von Beckerath 1943–1947, Stuttgart, 1986, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Eucken, Böhm and [[Constantin von Dietze]] believed in self-regulating market forces and limited indirect state interference.&lt;ref&gt;Grossekettler, H., Adolf Lampe, die Transformationsprobleme zwischen Friedens- und Kriegswirtschaften und die Arbeitsgemeinschaft Erwin von Beckerath, in: Goldschmidt, N. (ed.), Wirtschaft, Politik und Freiheit, Freiburg im Breisgau, 2005, p. 104 and Blumenberg-Lampe, C., Das Wirtschaftspolitische Programm der "Freiburger Kreise", Berlin, 1973, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eucken and his competitive order labelled ordoliberalism, the state must solely create a proper legal environment for the economy and maintain a healthy level of competition through measures that follow market principles. Thus, the paramount means by which economic policy can seek to improve the economy is by improving the institutional framework or "ordo".

In drawing on both Eucken's ordoliberal competitive order and [[Wilhelm Röpke]]'s economic humanism leading to a "Civitas Humana",&lt;ref&gt;Röpke, W., Grundfragen rationeller Wirtschaftspolitik, in: Zeitschrift für Schweizer Statistik &amp; Volkswirtschaft, no. 1, 1941, p. 112; Idem, Civitas Humana – Grundfragen der Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsordnung, Erlenbach-Zurich, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; the ordoliberal competitive order was further developed by the Cologne School around the economist and anthropologist [[Alfred Müller-Armack]], who therefore coined the term ''Soziale Marktwirtschaft'' ("social market economy") in a publication in December 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Armack, A., Wirtschaftslenkung und Marktwirtschaft, Hamburg, 1946, p. 88. However, the question of the origins of the term Soziale Marktwirtschaft is still controversial. In his autobiography Wahrheit und Wirklichkeit. Der Weg aus den Weltkriegen in die Soziale Marktwirtschaft und eine künftige Weltordnung, Homburg-Saarplatz, 1996, pp. 571 ff., Karl Günther Weiss, academic assistant to the former permanent representative of the State Secretary in the Reich Ministry of Economics, Otto Ohlendorf, argues, the term 'social market economy' was the outcome of a discussion with Ludwig Erhard on 12 Jan 1945. There is also some evidence that Harold Rasch, who in 1946/47 was deputy head of the inter-zonal economic administration in Minden, used the term in late 1947 and early 1948 independently of Müller-Armack (1901–1978); cf. Rasch, H., Grundlagen der Wirtschaftsverfassung, Bad Godesberg, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it evolved from ordoliberalism  as a new variant of [[neoliberalism]], this concept was not identical with the conception of the Freiburg School. In contrast to Eucken, who favoured a strictly procedural or rule-oriented liberalism in which the state solely sets the institutional framework and abstains generally from interference in the market, Müller-Armack emphasised the state's responsibility actively to improve the market condition and simultaneously to pursue a social balance.&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Armack, A., Soziale Marktwirtschaft – Handwörterbuch der Sozialwissenschaften, vol. 9, Göttingen, 1956, p. 390; Idem, Wirtschaftsordnung und Wirtschaftspolitik, Studien und Konzepte zur Sozialen Marktwirtschaft und zur Europäischen Integration, Freiburg im Breisgau, 1966, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; In putting social policy on a par with economic policy, Müller-Armack's concept was more emphatic regarding socio-political aims than the ordoliberal economic concept. However, the social market economy as an extension of neoliberal thought was deliberately not a defined economic order, but an adjustable holistic conception pursuing a complete humanistic societal order as a synthesis of seemingly conflicting objectives, namely economic freedom and social security.&lt;ref name="Müller-Armack, A. 1971, pp. 50" /&gt; Although it is often viewed as a ''mélange'' of socio-political ideas rather than a precisely outlined theoretical order, the conception possessed an effective slogan, which facilitated its communication to both politics and the public. However, the eventual implementation required not only communication, but also political backup.

Here, Müller-Armack's concept soon met with the conception of the then Chairman of the ''Sonderstelle Geld und Kredit'' (Special Bureau for Money and Credit) within the Administration for Finance, i.e. an expert commission preparing the currency reform in the then Anglo-American [[Bizone]], [[Ludwig Erhard]]. Although Erhard was rather inclined to Eucken's ordoliberal competitive market order&lt;ref&gt;Commun, P., Erhards Bekehrung zum Ordoliberalismus: Die grundlegende Bedeutung des wirtschaftspolitischen Diskurses in Umbruchszeiten, in: Freiburg Discussion Papers on Constitutional Economics 04/4, Freiburg im Breisgau, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and even considered himself an ordoliberal,&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., Deutsche Wirtschaftspolitik – Der Weg der Sozialen Marktwirtschaft, Düsseldorf/ Vienna/ New York/ Moscow, 1992 (originally published in 1962), p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt; he was strongly impressed by Müller-Armack most of all not as a theorist, but instead as one who wanted to transfer theory into practice.&lt;ref name="Hentschel, V. 1998, p. 25"/&gt;

When Erhard succeeded [[Johannes Semmler]] as Director of the Administration for Economics in the [[Bizonal Economic Council]] on 2 March 1948, the social market economy entered the political sphere. Soon after on 21 April 1948, Erhard informed the parliament about his economic policy and introduced the concept of the social market economy.&lt;ref&gt;Wörtliche Berichte über die 1.-40. Vollversammlung des Wirtschaftsrates des Vereinigten Wirtschaftsgebietes (Zweizonen-Wirtschaftsrat) in Frankfurt am Main, 8 vols., Wiesbaden/ Frankfurt am Main, 1947–1949, pp. 436 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was no unanimous applause, both the liberal democrats and the conservatives widely welcomed the transition to a more market-oriented economy.&lt;ref&gt;Görtemaker, M., Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Von der Gründung bis zur Gegenwart, Munich, 1999, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereupon, the Chairman of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) in the British zone of occupation, [[Konrad Adenauer]], invited Erhard to also inform the party members about his socio-economic conception at the party convention in Recklinghausen, Germany on 28 August 1948. In a visionary and stirring speech, entitled ''Marktwirtschaft im Streit der Meinungen'' ("Market Economy in Dispute"),&lt;ref&gt;Stoltenberg, G., Konrad Adenauer und die Soziale Marktwirtschaft, in: Die Politische Meinung, edited by the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (KAS), vol. 45 (373), Sankt Augin, 2000, pp. 21 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Erhard defended his concept of the social market economy alluding to the dualism between a controlled economy and a market economy.&lt;ref&gt;Erhard, L., l.c., 1992, pp. 69-85.&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the upcoming regional and federal elections, Adenauer, who was initially sceptical about Erhard,&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Armack, A., l.c., 1971, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; was not only impressed by the polarising slogan, i.e. "Controlled or Market Economy", but also by the efficacy of Erhard and his programme.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, H.-P., Adenauer. Der Aufstieg. 1876–1952, Stuttgart, 1986, p. 602.&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation for a successful political alliance was laid.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F078072-0004, Konrad Adenauer.jpg|thumbnail|[[Konrad Adenauer]], a proponent of the social market economy]]

Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] of the ruling CDU implemented a new novel economic order amalgamating the promotion of free competition with the responsibility of the social government. The [[Wirtschaftswunder]] or "economic miracle" of [[West Germany]] could not have been brought about without secure social peace in the country. Adenauer's program centered on legislation establishing co-determination in the coal and steel industry, the system of employee property formation, the equalization of burdens, the creation of subsidized housing, child benefits, the agricultural Green Plan and the dynamism of pensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kas.de/wf/en/71.3717/|title=Biography of Konrad Adenauer, Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 June 1948, the principles of the "social market economy" espoused by the CDU became the foundation of modern German economic policy:

{{quote|The "social market economy" is the socially anchored law for the industrial economy, according to which the achievements of free and able individuals are integrated into a system that produces the highest level of economic benefit and social justice for all. This system is created by freedom and responsibility, which find expression in the "social market economy" through genuine performance-based competition and the independent control of monopolies. Genuine performance-based competition exists when the rules of competition ensure that, under conditions of fair competition and equal opportunity, the better performance is rewarded. Market-driven prices regulate the interaction between all market participants.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Democratic Union, ''The CDU and the Social Market Economy: Düsseldorf Guidelines for Economic Policy, Agricultural Policy, Social Policy and Housing'' (1949)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU) also expressed its commitment to a market economy with social balance and the then newly elected Bavarian Minister for Economic Affairs [[Hanns Seidel]] advocated Erhard's liberal and social economic model at the CSU's party convention in Straubing in May 1949,&lt;ref&gt;Wirtschaftspolitische Richtlinien der CSU in Bayern, (supposedly end of 1948).&lt;/ref&gt; the economic principles elaborated by the Working Committee of the [[CDU/CSU]] as liaison body and information centre of the two political parties commonly referred to as the "Union", centred the social market economy.&lt;ref&gt;Wirtschaftspolitische Leitsätze der Arbeitsgemeinschaft der CDU/CSU, (presumably April 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, these principles were adopted as party platform and manifesto for the upcoming federal elections at the CDU's party conference in Düsseldorf on 15 July 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Narr, W.-D., CDU-SPD. Programm und Praxis seit 1945, Stuttgart, 1966, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the previous ideological Ahlener Programm suggesting a rather abstract and anti-materialist ''Gemeinwirtschaft'',&lt;ref&gt;Ahlener Programm, in: Heck, B. (ed.), Die CDU und ihr Programm – Programme, Erklärungen, Entschliessungen, Melle/ Sankt Augin, 1979, pp. 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt; these so-called ''Düsseldorfer Leitsätze'' not only provided a concrete, pragmatic and materialist economic programme, but also an attractive slogan to reach consensus within the party and the public. While eventually the union of the two recently established political parties (i.e. the CDU and the CSU) possessed a coherent and unifying economic programme enabling a more consistent public front, the oldest German political party, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), led by the advocate of economic planning and extensive socialisation [[Kurt Schumacher]], did not introduce its own economic concept. This not only complicated the parliamentary work of the party in the [[Economic Council]], but also limited the public relations of the party as a whole especially in times of campaigning where the partially complex political programmes were simplified and popularised.

In the run-up to the federal elections in August 1949, the CDU/CSU consequently aligned their party platforms, policies and manifestos and campaigned with the social market economy. In particular, the former advertising manager for consumer goods Ludwig Erhard, who affirmed that he would "go into the upcoming political party clashes with particular energy for the CDU",&lt;ref&gt;Wengst, U., Die CDU/CSU im Bundestagswahlkampf 1949, in: Viertelsjahreshefte für Zeitgeschichte (VfZ) 34, no. 1, Munich, 1986, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; realised the potential of subtle and systematic marketing to transform the concept from an economic theory, or even abstract economic policy, into the basis of a political party's propaganda and public image that held broad appeal. Eventually, on Sunday 14 August 1949 around 31 million Germans were called to cast a vote for the first German [[Bundestag]] and to decide between the social market economy and a controlled economy advocated by the SPD. Of those eligible to vote, 25 million or 78.5 per cent actually went to the ballot boxes and showed a clear commitment to the emerging post-war democracy.

Although the SPD turned out to be the most successful single party by gaining 29.12 per cent of the votes, the CDU/CSU combined attracted more votes, totalling 31 per cent and 139 mandates compared to 131 for the SPD. However, in fact both Volksparteien had suffered large percentage losses over their previous Land election totals by failing to capture a comparable share of the enlarged electorate. The most remarkable advance by winning over a million extra votes and achieving 11.9 per cent of the total votes was that made by the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) led by the chairman [[Theodor Heuss]]. The [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] FDP were in fact the only political party consistently gaining percentage of votes between 1946 and 1949. While these results affirmed the then general pro-market trend in public opinion, eventually, the electorate made its decision contingent on the satisfaction of its practical needs rather than on any particular theoretical economic system. The advantage of the CDU and the CSU lay precisely in the fact that they were quasi-governing across the [[Bizone]] and thus increasingly identified with the economic recovery and the improving economic conditions. Although the implementation of the social market economy benefited also from other crucial factors, including the East-West conflict and a favourable political and social climate within Germany and abroad, the stabilising alliance between the conservative and liberal parties, the pro-market composition of the Economic Council and even the Federal Republic's own ''[[Grundgesetz]]'' (Basic Law), which stressed individual freedom, human dignity and the subsidiarity of societal organisation, it was also the consistent efforts at political communication of the [[cooperative]] and corporate model that led to the implementation and eventual electoral validation of the social market economy in post-war West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Glossner, C. L., The Making of the German Post-War Economy – Political Communication and Public Reception of the social market economy after World War II, London, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first controversial, the model became increasingly popular in West Germany and Austria since in both states economic success (''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'') was identified with it. From the 1960s, the social market economy was the main economic model in mainland Western Europe, pursued by administrations of both the [[centre-right]] (led by the CDU/CSU) and the [[centre-left]] (led by the SPD). The concept of the social market economy is still the common economic basis of most political parties in Germany&lt;ref&gt;Hamburg Programme of the SPD, page 24, http://www.parteitag.spd.de/servlet/PB/show/1734195/Hamburger%20Programm%20engl.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911035738/http://www.parteitag.spd.de/servlet/PB/show/1734195/Hamburger%20Programm%20engl.pdf |date=2008-09-11 }}&lt;br/&gt;CDU on 60 years of social market economy, http://www.cdu.de/politikaz/wirtschaft.php&lt;br/&gt;Wiesbaden Programme of the FDP, page 14, http://www.fdp.de/files/565/wiesbaden-declaration.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and a commitment to some form of social market economy is present in Article 3 of the [[Treaty on European Union]].

=== United Kingdom ===

In the [[United Kingdom]], the concept of the social market economy was first introduced by the [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative]] politician [[Keith Joseph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/jicsc/05-034.pdf | title=Christianity and the Social Market Economy in Britain, Germany and Northern Ireland | author=Esmond Birnie | journal=Journal of the Irish Christian Study Centre | year=1994 | volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[World War II]], the main political parties agreed on the nationalization of industry and close economic regulation. In the 1970s, Joseph introduced the idea as an alternative to the [[post-war consensus]] allowing [[free markets]] for competition and innovation whilst the role of government was to help hold the ring, provide infrastructure, maintain a stable currency, a framework of laws, implementation of law and order, provision of a safety net (welfare state), defence of property rights and all other rights involved in the economic process. Throughout his political career, Joseph used his position to restate the principles of the social market economy and re-direct Conservative policy in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1994/dec/12/obituaries|title=Keith Joseph|first=John|last=Biffen|date=12 December 1994|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph eventually set up a think tank in 1974 to study the model and initially called it the Ludwig Erhard Foundation and Institute for a Social Market Economy before settling on the name [[Centre for Policy Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2015/11/06/comment-why-is-labour-still-so-obsessed-with-the-german-mode|title=Why is Labour still so obsessed with the German model?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Social Market Foundation]] (one of the top 12 think tanks in the country) founded by Conservative politician [[Daniel Finkelstein]] also aims at championing ideas of "a market economy with social obligations".

== Criticism ==
Although one of the main factors for the emergence of the European model of capitalism was to attempt to ameliorate the conditions of workers under capitalism and thus stave off the emergence of socialism or socialist revolution,&lt;ref&gt;''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}. "The European Model" (P.207): "Karl Marx also influenced the European model indirectly through his warnings about the inherent instability of capitalism. Western Europe, composed of prosperous nations ruled by Marx's hated bourgeoisie, feared that if the economy were left to its own devices, Marx's prediction of collapse would come true, and the proletariat would overthrow the ruling class... Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced social welfare legislation in Germany between 1883 and 1888, despite violent political opposition, as a direct attempt to stave off Marx's socialist revolution."&lt;/ref&gt; critics identify the social market model with the notions of the [[welfare state]] and sometimes mistakenly identify it as being [[Socialism|socialistic]].&lt;ref name="Hill2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=David B.

The '''Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products''' ('''Swissmedic''') is the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] surveillance authority for medicines and medical devices, registered in [[Berne]]. It started operations on 1 January 2002 as successor of ''Interkantonale Kontrollstelle für Heilmittel'' (IKS), which was itself the successor of ''Schweizerische Arzneimittelnebenwirkungszentrale'' (SANZ). Swissmedic is affiliated to the [[Federal Department of Home Affairs (Switzerland)|Federal Department of Home Affairs]].

==Structure==
Swissmedic is a federal institution subject to [[public law]] and was created by the Federal Act on Medicinal Products and Medical Devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/20002716/index.html Federal Act on Medicinal Products and Medical Devices] ()page visited on 10 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It is independent in organization and management and has authority over its own budget. Swissmedic has 300 full-time employees.

==Functions==
Any medical products for humans or animals need approval from Swissmedic to be brought on the Swiss market. Moreover, Swissmedic must be notified of all [[clinical study|clinical studies]] conducted in Switzerland.

When authorising new medicinal products, Swissmedic bases its decisions on internationally acknowledged criteria. The products may only be placed on the market if their quality, safety and effectiveness are sufficiently evaluated and proved.
If the criteria for authorisation are fulfilled, Swissmedic grants the marketing authorisation, specifies the method of sale (on prescription only/dispensing point) and approves the information for healthcare professionals and the patient information.

Costs of approval are paid by the applicant. Approval must be renewed after five years.

The World Openness Score is a measure that tracks the ability of the world’s population to travel visa-free.  It has grown from 17,904 to 20,143 between 2015 and Aug 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.passportindex.org/byHistoric.php |title=World Openness Score |publisher= Arton Capital|accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

The Passport Index compares passports mainly on their visa-free travel options, but also on how welcoming the countries are to other nationalities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.imidaily.com/editors-picks/the-passport-index-index-an-overview-of-passport-rankings/ |title=The Passport Index-Index – An Overview of Passport Rankings |publisher=Investment Migration Insider |date=2018-08-16 |accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its ranking, The Passport Index looks at 193 [[Member states of the United Nations|United Nations member countries]] and six territories, which include [[Taiwan|ROC Taiwan]], [[Macau|Macao (SAR China)]], [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong (SAR China)]], [[Kosovo]], [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian Territory]] and the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Territories annexed to other countries such as [[Norfolk Island|Norfolk Island (Australia)]], [[French Polynesia|French Polynesia (France)]], [[British Virgin Islands|British Virgin Islands (Britain)]] are excluded. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/global-passport-index-singapore/index.html|title=Singapore now offers the world's most powerful passport|last=Cripps|first=Karla|date=25th October 2017|website=CNN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/01/11/18/ph-passport-is-67th-most-powerful-in-the-world|title=PH passport is 67th most 'powerful' in the world|last=|first=|date=Jan 11 2018|website=CBN News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Visa-free score ''':'''The Passport Index ranks passports based on a "total visa-free score," which assigns passports a point for each country their holders can visit without a visa, with a visa on arrival or by obtaining [[Border control#Electronic%20Travel%20Authorisations|electronic travel authorization]] (ETA). The country with the highest visa-free score has the most powerful passport. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-10-25/passports-from-these-countries-are-the-most-powerful-for-travel|title=Countries With the Most Powerful Passports for Travel|last=Trimble|first=Megan|date=Oct. 25, 2017|website=US News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Welcoming Score ''':''' The Passport Index awards one point to each country’s passport which allows its bearer to enter visa-free or with visa on arrival. The country with the highest welcoming score is the most welcoming country in the world.
* World Openness Score : The World Openness Score is a measure that reflects the travel openness between countries.  It has grown from 17,904 to 18,680 between 2015 and Aug 2017. On November 21, 2018 it had reached 20,189.
*  Global Mobility Score : The Global Mobility Score is a benchmark that shows an individual’s level of freedom of global mobility reflecting one or more passports in their possession. Higher scores reflect increased freedom of mobility.

== Ranking ==

* Global Passport Power Rank ''':''' World’s passports are ranked by their total visa-free score. Countries that share equal visa free scores, are sorted by the number of visa-free countries portion of that score.
* '''I'''ndividual Passport Power Rank ''':''' Data from the latest [[Human Development Index|UN Human Development Index]] is used to further break the ties and order the countries in unique ranks. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/global-passport-index-singapore/index.html|title=Singapore now offers the world's most powerful passport|last=Cripps|first=Karla|date=25th October 2017|website=CNN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Welcoming Countries Rank''':''' The Passport Index ranks countries by how welcoming they are to other nationalities.

== Results ==

Passport Index rankings are in real-time and continue to vary as new changes to visa agreements are made. For the most part, the Top 10 places have been occupied by European countries with the exception of Singapore.

Between 2017-2018, at top of the list with a visa-free score of 165 are Singapore and Germany, while US, South Korea, France, Denmark and Sweden are among the 11 countries that share the second spot with a score of 164. The UAE passport now takes first place with a visa-free score of 167.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/uae-passport-now-worlds/-4th-most-powerful|title=UAE passport now world's 4th most powerful|last=|first=|date=October 31, 2018|website=Khaleej times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case studies ==

'''United Arab Emirates''' 

In 2017, The Passport Index was assigned to monitor the development of the newly launched UAE Passport Force Initiative, with the aim to position the [[Emirati passport]] on the list of the five most powerful passports in the world by 2021. By October 31st, 2018, the Emirati passport had already reached 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; place..&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Times Square Red, Times Square Blue''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book written by [[science fiction]] author [[Samuel R. Delany]] and published in [[1999 in literature|1999]] by the [[New York University Press]]. The book is a compilation of two separate [[essay]]s: ''Times Square Blue'' and ''...Three, Two, One, Contact: Times Square Red''.

==Contents==

===''Times Square Blue''===
''Times Square Blue'' is a first-hand narrative of Delany's (often referred to as "Chip," or, occasionally, as "The Professor") sexual exploits in [[Times Square]]'s [[adult movie theater|pornographic movie theaters]] with other men (some [[homosexuality|homosexual]], some [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]]) from 1960 through the mid-1990s. He also describes, in detail, his relationships with these men inside and outside the theatres.

===''...Three, Two, One, Contact: Times Square Red''===
The second essay in the book discusses the nature of [[social relation]]s within the realm of [[urban studies]]. Delany proposes two kinds of relationships, "contact" and "networking," and analyzes the content and benefits of each. He also refers extensively to [[Jane Jacobs]]' ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''.

'''Viola Fauver Gregg Liuzzo''' (April 11, 1925 – March 25, 1965) was a [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]]&lt;ref name="uua"/&gt; [[civil rights]] activist from [[Michigan]]. In March 1965 Liuzzo, then a housewife and mother of five with a history of local activism, heeded the call of [[Martin Luther King Jr]] and traveled from [[Detroit]], Michigan, to [[Selma, Alabama]] in the wake of the [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]] attempt at marching across the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]].  Liuzzo participated in the successful [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and helped with coordination and logistics. Driving back from a trip shuttling fellow activists to the Montgomery airport, she was murdered by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. She was 39 years old.

One of the four Klansmen in the car from which the shots were fired was [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) informant [[Gary Thomas Rowe]].&lt;ref name="uua"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html |title=Viola Liuzzo |work=Dictionary of Unitarian &amp; Universalist Biography |publisher=Uua.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316062159/http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html |archive-date=2013-03-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jrhighdropout.com/post/105092804453/government-evils-not-to-be-forgotten |title=Government Evils Not To Be Forgotten |publisher=JrHighDropOut.com |date= |accessdate=2014-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rowe testified against the shooters and was given [[witness protection]] by the FBI.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/04/us/gary-t-rowe-jr-64-who-informed-on-klan-in-civil-rights-killing-is-dead.html|title=Gary T. Rowe Jr., 64, Who Informed on Klan In Civil Rights Killing, Is Dead|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FBI later leaked what were purported to be salacious details about Liuzzo. The FBI attempted to downplay the situation and discredit Liuzzo by spreading rumors that she was a member of the [[Communist Party]], was a heroin addict,&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;Jack Anderson (March 21, 1983). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1982&amp;dat=19830321&amp;id=QV1GAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zTENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2477,2441456&amp;hl=en "Hoover smear tactics hurt civil rights case"]. ''The Evening News''.&lt;/ref&gt; and had abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with African-Americans involved in the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Viola Liuzzo|url = http://uudb.org/articles/violaliuzzo.html|website = uudb.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these were either proved or substantiated in any way.

In addition to other honors, Liuzzo's name is today inscribed on the [[Civil Rights Memorial]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], created by Maya Lin.

==Early life==
Liuzzo was born '''Viola Fauver Gregg''' on April 1, 1925, in the small town of [[California, Pennsylvania]], the elder daughter of Eva Wilson, a teacher, and Heber Ernest Gregg, a coal miner and World War I veteran. He left school in the eighth grade but taught himself to read. Her mother Eva had a teaching certificate from the University of Pittsburgh. The couple had one other daughter, Rose Mary, in 1930. While on the job, Heber's right hand was blown off in a mine explosion and, during the [[Great Depression]], the Greggs became solely dependent on Eva's income. Work was very hard to come by for Mrs. Gregg, as she could pick up only sporadic, short-term teaching positions. The family descended further into poverty and decided to move from Georgia to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where Eva found a teaching position, when Viola was six.&lt;ref name="serialssolutions2004"&gt;Stanton, Mary (2004). "Viola Liuzzo and the Gendered Politics of Martyrdom: From Selma to Sorrow: The Life and Death of Viola Liuzzo". ''[[Harvard Women's Law Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family was very poor and lived in one-room shacks with no running water. The schools Liuzzo attended did not have adequate supplies and the teachers were too busy to give extra attention to children in need. Because the family moved so often, Liuzzo never began and ended the school year in the same place. Having spent much of her childhood and adolescence poor in Tennessee, Viola experienced the segregated nature of the South firsthand. This would have a powerful impact on her activism. It was during her formative years that she realized the injustice of segregation and racism, as she and her family, in similar conditions of great poverty, were still afforded social privilege and amenities denied to African-Americans under the Jim Crow laws.&lt;ref name="serialssolutionscivil"&gt;http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/93289614&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michigan==
In 1941 the Gregg family moved to [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], where her father sought a job assembling bombs at the Ford Motor Co. Viola's strong-willed nature led her to drop out of high school after one year, and elope at the age of 16. The marriage did not last and she returned to her family. Two years later the Gregg family moved to [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], which was starkly segregated by race.  Tensions between whites and blacks there was very high and the early 1940s saw violence and rioting.  Witnessing these horrific ordeals was a major motivator that influenced Viola's future civil rights work.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 she married George Argyris, the manager of a restaurant where she worked. They had two children, Penny and Evangeline Mary, and divorced in 1949.&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt; She later married Anthony Liuzzo, a [[Teamsters]] union business agent.&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teamsters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teamster.org/content/civil-rights-martyr-viola-liuzzo |title=Civil Rights Martyr Viola Liuzzo |publisher=[[Teamsters]] |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children: Tommy, Anthony Jr. and Sally.&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt;  Liuzzo sought to return to school, and attended the Carnegie Institute in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. She then enrolled part-time at [[Wayne State University]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="uu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Viola Liuzzo |url=http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030626124213/http://www.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/violaliuzzo.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 26, 2003 |publisher=[[Unitarian Universalist Association]] |accessdate=March 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 she began attending the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Detroit, and joined the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).&lt;ref name="uu"/&gt;

A large part of Viola's activism, particularly with the NAACP, was due to a close friendship with an African-American woman, Sarah Evans. After initially meeting in a grocery store where Liuzzo worked as a cashier, the two kept in touch. Evans eventually became Liuzzo's housekeeper while still maintaining a close, friendly relationship in which they shared similar views including support for the civil rights movement. In the aftermath of Liuzzo's death, Evans would go on to become the permanent caretaker of Liuzzo's five young children.&lt;ref name="serialssolutions2004"/&gt;

Liuzzo so passionately believed in the fight for civil rights that she helped organize Detroit protests, attended civil rights conferences and worked with the NAACP. She had a strong desire to make a difference on as large a scale as she could.&lt;ref name="serialssolutionscivil"/&gt;

==Local activism==
In addition to actively supporting the civil rights movement, Liuzzo was also notable for her protest against Detroit's laws that allowed for students to more easily drop out of school. Her disagreement with this law led her to withdraw her children from school in protest. Because she deliberately home-schooled them for two months, Liuzzo was arrested, but did not waiver. She pleaded guilty in court and was placed on probation.&lt;ref name="serialssolutions2004"/&gt;

==Selma==
In February 1965 a night demonstration for voting rights at the Marion, Alabama, courthouse turned violent. State troopers clubbed marchers and beat and shot a 26-year-old African-American named [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]], who later died. His death spurred on the fight for civil rights in Selma, Alabama. The [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) scheduled a protest march for Sunday, March 7, 1965. Gov. George Wallace banned the march, but the ban was ignored. Six hundred marchers headed for the arched [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] that crossed the Alabama River. As the protesters reached the crest of the bridge, they saw a terrifying sight on the other side: state troopers armed with clubs, whips and tear gas and a sheriff's posse on horseback. When told to stop and disperse, the marchers refused. The troopers advanced on the marchers, clubbing and whipping them, fracturing bones and gashing heads. Seventeen people were hospitalized on the day later called "[[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]]".

Liuzzo was horrified by the images of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|aborted march]] on Bloody Sunday. A second march took place March 9. Troopers, police and marchers confronted each other at the county end of the bridge, but when the troopers stepped aside to let them pass, the [[Rev. Martin Luther King]] led the marchers back to the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Branch | first = Taylor | title = The King Years: Historic Moments in the Civil Rights Movement | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was obeying a federal injunction while seeking protection from federal court for the march. That night a white group beat and murdered civil rights activist [[James Reeb]], a Unitarian Universalist minister from Boston, who had come to Selma to march with the second group.&lt;ref&gt;http://uudb.org/articles/jamesjosephreeb.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many other clergy and sympathizers from across the country also gathered for the second march.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On March 16, Liuzzo took part in a protest at Wayne State. She then called her husband to tell him she would be traveling to [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] after hearing the Rev Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. call for people of all faiths to come and help, saying that the struggle "was everybody's fight."   Leaving her children in the care of family and friends she contacted the Southern Christian Leadership Conference who took her on and tasked her with delivering aid to various locations, welcoming and recruiting volunteers and transporting volunteers and marchers to and from airports, bus terminals and train stations, for which she volunteered the use of her car,&lt;ref name="serialssolutions2004"/&gt; a 1963 [[Oldsmobile]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On March 21, 1965 more than 3,000 people began the third march, including blacks, whites, doctors, nurses, working-class people, priests, nuns, rabbis, homemakers, students, actors, and farmers. Many famous people participated, including Dr. Martin Luther King, [[Ralph Bunche]], [[Coretta Scott King]], [[Ralph Abernathy]], and [[Andrew Young]]. It took five days for the protesters to reach their goal. Liuzzo marched the first full day and returned to Selma for the night. That Wednesday, March 24, she rejoined the march four miles from the end, where a "Night of the Stars" celebration was held the City of St. Jude with performances by many popular entertainers of the day, including [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Joan Baez]], and [[Dick Gregory]]. Liuzzo helped at the first aid station. On Thursday, Liuzzo and other marchers reached the state capitol building, with a Confederate flag flying above it. Martin Luther King addressed the crowd of 25,000, calling the march, a "shining moment in American history."{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Murder and aftermath==
After the third march concluded on March 25, Liuzzo, assisted by Leroy Moton, a 19-year-old [[African American]], continued shuttling marchers and volunteers from Montgomery back to Selma in her car.  As they were driving along Route 80, a car tried to force them off the road. After dropping passengers in Selma, she and Moton headed back to Montgomery. As they were getting gas at a local filling station, they were subject to abusive calls and racist scorn. When Liuzzo stopped at a red light, a car with four members of the local [[Ku Klux Klan]] pulled up alongside her. When they saw a white woman and a black man in a car together, they followed Liuzzo as she tried to outrun them. Overtaking the Oldsmobile, they shot directly at Liuzzo, mortally wounding her twice in the head. The car veered into a ditch, crashing into a fence.&lt;ref name="teamsters"/&gt;

Although Moton was covered with blood, the bullets missed him. He lay motionless when the Klansmen reached the car to check on their victims. After the Klansmen left, Moton began searching for help, and eventually flagged down a truck driven by Rev. Leon Riley. Like Moton and Liuzzo, Riley was shuttling civil rights workers back to Selma.

Liuzzo's funeral was held at Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church on March 30 in Detroit, with many prominent members of both the civil rights movement and government there to pay their respects. Included in this group were [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]]; [[NAACP]] executive director [[Roy Wilkins]]; [[Congress on Racial Equality]] national leader [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]]; Michigan lieutenant governor [[William G. Milliken]]; Teamsters president [[Jimmy Hoffa]]; and [[United Auto Workers]] president [[Walter Reuther]]. She was buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield, Michigan.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Less than two weeks after her death, a [[Cross burning|charred cross]] was found in front of four Detroit homes, including the Liuzzo residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fourth Cross Is Burned On Detroit Lawn |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/823323// |newspaper=[[The Brownsville Herald]]|date=April 4, 1964|page=1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=August 4, 2014}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and legal proceedings==
The four Klan members in the car, Collie Wilkins (21), FBI informant Gary Rowe (34), William Eaton (41) and Eugene Thomas (42) were quickly arrested; within 24 hours, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] appeared on national television to announce their arrest. In order to avoid bad press, President Johnson made sure to focus on the positive work of the FBI agents' solving of the murder of Viola Liuzzo, in an attempt to divert scrutiny away from the fact that one of the men in the car, Gary Thomas Rowe, Jr., was an FBI informant and therefore protected by the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/111/3/870.full |author=Gary May |title=The Informant: The FBI, The Ku Klux Klan, and the Murder of Viola Liuzzo |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2005 |page=431 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alabama mistrial and acquittal===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
Wilkins, Eaton, and Thomas were indicted in the State of Alabama for Liuzzo's death on April 22. FBI informant Rowe was not indicted and served as a witness.  Rowe testified that Wilkins had fired two shots on the order of Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;http://law.jrank.org/pages/3141/Collie-Leroy-Wilkins-Trial-1965.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal civil trial===
The next phase of the lengthy process began when a federal trial charged the defendants with conspiracy to intimidate African Americans under the 1871 [[Civil Rights Act of 1871|Ku Klux Klan Act]], a [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] civil rights statute. The charges did not specifically refer to Liuzzo's murder. On December 3, the trio were found guilty by an all-white, all-male jury, and were sentenced to ten years in prison, a landmark in Southern legal history.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, p 130&lt;/ref&gt;

While out on appeal, Wilkins and Thomas were each found guilty of firearms violations and sent to jail for those crimes. During this period, the January 15, 1966, edition of the ''[[Birmingham News]]'' published an ad offering Liuzzo's bullet-ridden car for sale. Asking $3,500, the ad read, "Do you need a crowd-getter? I have a 1963 Oldsmobile two-door in which Mrs. Viola Liuzzo was killed. Bullet holes and everything intact. Ideal to bring in crowds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liuzzo protests car advertising|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EcIlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HPUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2564,308263&amp;dq=vilola+liuzzo&amp;hl=en|accessdate=21 June 2011|newspaper=Baltimore Afro-American|date=18 January 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After all three defendants were convicted of the federal charges, state murder cases proceeded against Eaton and Thomas. Eaton, the only defendant who remained out of jail, died of a heart attack on March 9. Thomas's state murder trial – the final trial – got under way on September 26, 1966. The prosecution built a strong circumstantial case in the trial that included an FBI ballistics expert testifying that the bullet removed from the woman's brain was fired from a revolver owned by Thomas. Two witnesses testified they had seen Wilkins drinking beer at a [[VFW]] Hall near Birmingham, 125 miles from the murder scene, an hour or less after Liuzzo was shot. Despite the presence of eight African Americans on the jury, Thomas was acquitted of the state murder charge the following day after just 90 minutes of deliberations. State attorney general [[Richmond Flowers, Sr.]] criticized the verdict, deriding the black members of the panel, who had been carefully screened, as "[[Uncle Tom]]s."

On April 27, 1967, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[New Orleans]] upheld the federal convictions of the surviving defendants. Thomas served six years in prison for the crime. Due to threats from the Klan, both before and after his testimony, Gary Thomas Rowe went into the federal witness protection program.&lt;ref name=RoweVGriffin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openjurist.org/676/f2d/524/rowe-v-griffin-o |title=676 F. 2d 524 – Rowe v. Griffin |author=Judge Peter Thorp Fay for the United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit |date=May 17, 1982 |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]/OpenJurist |accessdate=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe died in 1998 in Savannah, Georgia, after having lived several decades under several assumed identities.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==FBI cover-up and leaks==
Within 24 hours after Liuzzo's assassination by the Ku Klux Klan and the FBI's informant Gary Thomas Rowe, [[J. Edgar Hoover]] began a smear campaign to the press, to subordinate FBI agents and to select politicians, claiming the cut marks from the car's shattered window were "puncture marks in her arm indicating recent use of a hypodermic needle; she was sitting very, very close to that negro in the car; that it has the appearance of a necking party."&lt;ref name="news.google.com"/&gt;

While attempting to obscure the fact that an FBI informant was in the car, and to ensure that the FBI was not held responsible for permitting their informant to participate in violent acts, without FBI surveillance or backup, the FBI was concerned that they might be held accountable for their informant's (Rowe) role in the death.  Rowe had been an informant for the FBI since 1960. The FBI was aware that Rowe had participated in acts of violence during Ku Klux Klan activities. On the day of Liuzzo's death, prior to the shooting, Rowe called his FBI contact and notified him that Rowe and other Klansman were travelling to Montgomery, and that violence was planned.&lt;ref name="Stanton, pp 52-55"&gt;Stanton, pp 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Autopsy testing in 1965 showed no traces of drugs in Liuzzo's system, and that she had not had sex recently at the time of death.   The FBI's role in the smear campaign was uncovered in 1978 when Liuzzo's children obtained case documents from the FBI under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, pp 52–55, 189–192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blake, p 201.  Quote from Penny on p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation and subsequent lawsuits==
[[File:Memorial to Viola Fauver Gregg Liuzzo, (Lowndes County, Alabama).jpg|thumb|200 px|Memorial to Viola Fauver Gregg Liuzzo in Lowndes County, Alabama]]
Liuzzo was condemned by different racist organizations for having brought her death upon herself. At the time, Liuzzo's choice to immerse herself in such a dangerous undertaking was seen by some as radical and controversial. However, of all the deaths to occur during the campaign, Liuzzo's was the only one scrutinized in such a way, where other male activists who were killed were recognized as heroes.&lt;ref name="serialssolutionscivil"/&gt;

Rowe was indicted in 1978 and tried for his involvement in the murder.&lt;ref&gt;Ingalls, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; The first trial ended in a [[hung jury]], and the second trial ended in his acquittal.&lt;ref name=RoweVGriffin/&gt;

On May 27, 1983, Judge [[Charles Wycliffe Joiner]] rejected the claims in the Liuzzo family lawsuit, saying there was "no evidence the FBI was in any type of joint venture with Rowe or conspiracy against Mrs. Liuzzo. Rowe's presence in the car was the principal reason why the crime was solved so quickly." In response to the verdict, Liuzzo family lawyer Dean A. Robb said "This is a terrible opinion. I'm shocked. I think this is incredible."&lt;ref name="AAN"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pyen |first1=Chong |last2=Cain |first2=Stephen |title=Judge Rules Against Liuzzo Family |url=https://aadl.org/aa_news_19830527-judge_rules_against_liuzzo_family |accessdate=4 August 2018 |work=Ann Arbor News |date=27 May 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1983, the FBI was awarded $79,873 in court costs,&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Sixties: A Decade of Culture and Counterculture'' {{ISBN|978-0-313-32944-9}} p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; but costs were later reduced to $3,645 after the [[ACLU]] appealed on behalf of the family.&lt;ref&gt;See Liuzzo v. US, 565 F. Supp. 640 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[Walter P. Reuther Library]] contains original archival material surrounding Liuzzo and her case. [http://reuther.wayne.edu/files/UP001745_.pdf The Viola Liuzzo Papers] contain documentation of the events surrounding the murder, the resulting investigation, and later legal involvement of the Liuzzo Family. The papers contain FBI murder investigation files and completed Freedom of Information and Privacy Act (FOIPA) requests for the FBI's involvement with the Ku Klux Klan. Several documents relate to the Freedom Riders.

Liuzzo was featured in part 3 of a series of videos, ''Free at Last: Civil Rights Heroes''.

Her murder was shown in Episode 2 of the ''[[King (TV miniseries)|King]]'' miniseries.

Viola Liuzzo Park is located at Winthrop and Trojan in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/life/2015/04/07/viola-liuzzo-detroit-wayne-state-degree-selma-civil-rights/25432865/ |title=Week of events will honor Viola Liuzzo |publisher=Detroitnews.com |date=2015-04-07 |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liuzzo has her name included as part of the [[Civil Rights Memorial]], a monument in Montgomery, Alabama, created by [[Maya Lin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/civil-rights-memorial/civil-rights-martyrs |title=Civil Rights Martyrs &amp;#124; Southern Poverty Law Center |publisher=Splcenter.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Liuzzo was the subject of a documentary, ''[[Home of the Brave (2004 film)|Home of the Brave]]''.

In 2008, Liuzzo's story was memorialized in a song, "Color Blind Angel" by the late blues singer [[Robin Rogers]] on her [[album]] ''Treat Me Right''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horowitz |first=Hal |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/treat-me-right-mw0000789597 |title=Treat Me Right – Robin Rogers : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Viola Liuzzo Ethics Scholarship was started at [[Adrian College]] by her grandson, Joshua James Liuzzo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/adriancollege_/docs/contactmagspring2012/23 |title=Contact Magazine Spring 2012 by Adrian College |publisher=ISSUU |date= |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, ''Outside Agitators'' was written by 20% Theater's Artistic Associate, Laura Nessler. Inspired by and based on Liuzzo's story, the play premiered at the Prop Theater in Chicago, Illinois, on September 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/outside-agitators/Event?oid=14993117|title=Outside Agitators|work=Chicago Reader|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liuzzo was played by [[Tara Ochs]] in the 2014 film [[Selma (film)|''Selma'']].

In 2015, [[Wayne State University]] bestowed its first posthumous honorary doctorate degree on Liuzzo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spratling |first=Cassandra |url=http://www.freep.com/story/life/2015/04/10/viola-liuzzo-wayne-state-university-honor/25603257/ |title=Wayne State hails civil rights icon Viola Liuzzo as hero |publisher=Freep.com |date=1965-03-25 |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World in Common (WiC) project was formed in November 2002 by former members of ''[[Spanner (journal)|Spanner]]'' as an effort by various participants in the [[Left-wing politics|libertarian left]] to overcome the [[sectarian]] divisions that have historically prevented any attempts toward common understanding or potential cooperation among them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ainfos.ca/04/apr/ainfos00360.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldincommon.org/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldsocialism.org"&gt;http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/june04/splinters.html&lt;/ref&gt;

This sectarianism was especially troublesome to those who saw that sharing the goals of abolishing [[Capitalism]], no matter whether in its private, corporate or state varieties, and the State along with it -as well as a rejection of the vitiating distraction of [[reformist]] politics – was vastly more important than what the project terms “intra-sector” quarrels, especially when faced with the more important struggle against all forms of class rule.&lt;ref name="worldsocialism.org"/&gt;

==Object==
The “sector” to which WiC’s statements frequently refer consists of what some have called the “Thin Red/Black Line”; a shorthand way of referring to the small but highly diverse sector of various non-market, anti-statist, libertarian socialists – whether organised or not – consisting of; e.g., syndicalists, anarcho-communists, libertarian municipalists, world socialists, socialist industrial unionists, council communists, autonomists, platformists, situationists, ultra-leftists, etc.

==History==
Previous efforts to bring these various elements together, and, to a greater or lesser extent, inspiring those who founded the World in Common project, were the [http://libertariansocialism.4t.com/ Discussion Bulletin of Frank Girard], published from 1983 to July 2003, the year before Girard’s death; The “Imagine International” circular among these same groups in the late 1990s; [http://www.connexions.org/RedMenace/Docs/RM2-WhatIsTheRedMenace.htm The Red Menace, a Canadian publication] of the 1970s; as well as the writings of such thinkers as [[Maximilien Rubel]], John Crump, and not infrequent references to the commonalities in many of the classic anarchist and socialist thinkers.

The purpose of WiC (according to the WiC “Core Statement”)is “to help inspire a vision of an alternative way of living where all the world’s resources are owned in common and democratically controlled by communities on an ecologically sustainable and socially harmonious basis”. Of course, the many other groups and political parties in this sector have much the same objective but the role that WiC envisions for itself is unique. In their view, one of the reasons that the anti-market anti-statist sector remains relatively small and ineffectual has to do with the extent to which the various groups remain isolated from each other and regard each other with mutual suspicion, and even sectarian hostility.&lt;ref name="worldincommon.org"&gt;http://www.worldincommon.org/join.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
While explicitly not suggesting that all these “strands” of this sector submerge their differences and unite in some large organization, which is seen by WiC as both unrealistic and even undesirable, they do support an intermediate position between that extreme and the other, of exclusionist hostility. On that basis, they do not see themselves as rivals to any group in the sector and some members belong to one or other such groups. Nor do they see themselves, in any sense, as a political party. Among the members currently are self-identified council communists, anarcho-socialists, DeLeonists, libertarian socialists, and world socialists, both with and without organised affiliations to their political positions. World in Common was established to provide a meeting ground for the different groups and individuals within the sector as well as a means of facilitating practical collaboration between them at some level, while recognizing that there are sharp differences of opinion on many different subjects within our sector but what they do not feel has been sufficiently recognised – and celebrated – is just how much these groups have in common with each other. It is these commonalities that are, in fact, rather more significant than the issues that divide us which the World in Common network attempts to highlight by means of various websites, internet discussion groups, an occasional journal, Common Voice (2005),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cvoice.org/&lt;/ref&gt; a collective blog, and various real world interactions with the various elements making up the “impossibilist” non-market political sector, whether they prefer the term anarchist, communist, socialist.

==Membership==
Membership in the World in Common project is open to [[anti-capitalists]], anti-statists, anti-reformists, anti-authoritarians, anti-vanguardists, anarchists, [[communists]], socialists, syndicalists, anarcho-communists, libertarian municipalists, world socialists, socialist industrial unionists, council communists, and any who reject capitalism’s wage, [[Market economy|market]], and [[money]] system as well as capitalist politics and capitalist unionism and who recognise that the above are on the same relative side in the struggle against all of capitalism’s forces, including its statist left-wing of vanguardists and social democrats, and who seek ways to practically – in their local areas – assist this political sector to grow as a whole while engaging in comradely discussion at all levels, if in broad agreement with the Core Statement.&lt;ref name="worldincommon.org"/&gt;
