'''Albert I of Brunswick-Grubenhagen''' ({{circa|1339}} &amp;ndash; probably 1383) was a Duke of [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick-Lüneburg]], and Prince of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick]]-[[Principality of Grubenhagen|Grubenhagen]]-Salzderhelden.  He reigned from 1361 until his death.

Albert I was the eldest son of the Duke [[Ernest I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen|Ernest the elder]] of Grubenhagen and his wife, Adelheid of Eberstein.  In 1359, his father made him co-ruler.  After his father's death in 1361, he ruled the principality alone, except for a few possessions at [[Osterode am Harz|Osterode]] and [[Herzberg am Harz|Herzberg]], which he ceded to his brother Frederick.  He lived alone at Salzderhelden Castle in [[Einbeck]], which is why he was nicknamed "Duke of Salt".

He has been praised as a lover of history and science.  Nevertheless, highway robbery flourished during his rule, and he may even have engaged in it himself, which got him into a dispute with his neighbours.  On 28 Jun 1361, he shared a letter of tribute from the City of Brunswick with his brother John, but later that year, he got into a feud with Count Otto of [[Waldeck (state)|Waldeck]] and his son Henry.  In 1362, Albert and John were captured during the battle at Arnoldshausen.  They were only released after they had sworn ''Urfehde''.

The territories of Landgrave [[Frederick III, Landgrave of Thuringia|Frederick III]] of Thuringia were particularly hard hit by the forays of Albert and his vassals.  After several unsuccessful warnings, Frederick III attacked Grubenhagen in 1365 with what was then considered a major army.  It has been claimed that the army numbered over eighteen thousand men.  They made camp before Einbeck and Salzderhelden.  However, after a few months, they had to leave without having accomplished anything.  The account of this attack contains the first mention of a gun in Brunswick (''diz waz die erste buchse, dy yn dessin landin vernommen wart'').  The Landgrave devastated towns and villages, and captured and tore down the robber castles of several of Albert's vassals and thereby forced him to sue for peace.  Albert soon  broke the peace again, the Landgrave devastated his country again, and Albert had to wait in [[Eisenach]] until the dispute was arbitrated.

Due to these feuds, Albert was short of money and had to pledge some of his possessions.  For example, in 1365 he pledged the bailiwick of Hamelin to Coun John of Spigelbert and in 1372, the city of [[Hamelin]] itself to Count Otto of Schaumburg and in 1370, to the City Council of Brunswick, his share of the precincts Altewiek and Sack, the judiciary, the Jewish tax and the mills of Brunswick.  In 1381, he sold several villages located around Einbeck for 300 Rhenish florins to the [[diocese of Hildesheim|Bishop of Hildesheim]].

Albert was married with Agnes, daughter of Duke [[Magnus II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Magnus with the chain]] of Brunswick.  They had one son: [[Eric I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen|Eric I]].

Albert probably died in 1383 and was buried in St. Alexandri Minster in [[Einbeck]].

'''Alexander de Abernethy''' (after 1271 - † c. 1315) was a Scottish baron. He was a son of [[Hugh de Abernethy]] and [[Maria de Ergadia]]. Alexander was a descendant of abbots of [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]]; his great-grandfather [[Laurence de Abernethy|Laurence]], great-grandson of [[Gille Míchéil, Earl of Fife|Gillemichael, Earl of Fife]], was the first to style himself Lord (''dominus'')&lt;ref&gt;Laurence de Abernethy was previously noted as the grandfather of Sir Alexander, but this is in error.  Alexander's parents were Sir Hugh de Abernethy and his wife Mary of Argyll; Sir Hugh's father was Patrick de Abernethy, who predeceased his father Laurence.  Charles J. Leslie, Historical Records of the Family of Leslie (Edinburgh: Edmonston and Douglas, 1869), p. 37, note A.  Andrew B. W. MacEwen kindly advised of this correction.&lt;/ref&gt;  His daughter Margaret married [[John Stewart, 1st Earl of Angus|John Stewart of Bonkyll]], the new Scottish [[earl of Angus]].

Alexander swore [[fealty]] to [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in 1291, presumably on the death of his father, [[Hugh de Abernethy|Hugh]]. Between 1301 and 1303 he was appointed warden of Scotland between the [[River Forth|Forth]] and the [[Mounth]]. He joined the expedition in 1303 to [[Strathearn]] and in 1304 to [[Menteith]] to put down uprisings. He lost the office in King Edward's ordinances of 1305 but supported [[House of Balliol|Balliol]]'s claims over [[House of Bruce|Bruce]]'s. He was ordered to join the expedition of [[John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond|John of Brittany]] to defend [[Galloway]] against [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]] and was absent from King Robert's first [[Parliament of Scotland|parliament]] in 1309. In June 1308 he was appointed warden of Scotland between [[River Forth|the Forth]] and [[Orkney]] together with Edward Hastings; and in July 1310 - warden between the Forth and the mountains. He was also contracted to serve from September in [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] and [[Perthshire]] under the command of Sir John de Segrave. He received [[Clackmannan]] in [[Stirlingshire]] from [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] in 1310, was Constable of [[Dundee]] at least in mid-1311 and led the unsuccessful defence of the town against [[Edward Bruce]] in 1312. In 1314 Abernethy was forfeited and attached to the earldom of Angus, so Alexander went to England and died by the end of 1315. He also held the positions of the Sheriffdoms of [[Sheriff of Kincardine|Kincardine]], [[Sheriff of Forfar|Forfar]] and [[Sheriff of Perth|Perth]] and joint warden between the Forth and [[Orkney]].

He married [[Margaret de Menteith]], daughter of [[Alexander, Earl of Menteith]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Ravilious, The Earls of Menteith: Alexander, Earl of Menteith and Sir Alexander de Abernethy, The Scottish Genealogist (September 2010), Vol. LVII, No. 3, pp. 130–139&lt;/ref&gt;  'lady Margaret de Abrenythy' was a lady of the court of [[Isabella of France]], Queen of England, 1311/12.  She resided in England as late as 30 Jan 1324/5, when a record in the [[Calendar of Patent Rolls]] dated at Langley stated, ' 860.  The K. signifies that he has granted leave to Margaret de Abernethy to visit Scotland, to treat with her friends there as to recovery of her hereditary lands.  Langley. '&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Patent Rolls, 18 Edw. II. p. 2, p. 87, m. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

They had issue:
* [[Margaret de Abernethy]], wife of [[John Stewart, 1st Earl of Angus]].
* [[Mary de Abernethy]], wife of (1) Sir Andrew de Leslie, and (2) Sir David de Lindsay.

The death of a [[pet]] or an [[animal]] to which one has become emotionally bonded can be an intense loss,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl_kiyRKYDcC&amp;pg=PR9 Pet loss and human emotion: a guide to recovery by Cheri Barton Ross, p.17]&lt;/ref&gt; comparable with the [[death]] of a human loved one, or even greater depending on the individual.

==Effect of animal loss on humans==
There is no set amount of time for the grieving process to occur. However, mourning is much more intense for a pet upon whom the owner was emotionally dependent. Additionally, some pet owners may feel unable to express their grieving due to social mores surrounding pets. If the pet owner internalizes the grief, the suffering increases.&lt;ref&gt;The Loss of a Pet By Wallace Sife p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kübler-Ross model|stages of grief]] proposed by [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross|Elizabeth Kübler-Ross]] was designed in relation to human death, but can be adapted to describe the grief process for the death of a pet.&lt;ref&gt;The Loss of a Pet By Wallace Sife p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, pet death includes several lessons: 1) the relationship rather than the object (the animal) is central to understand the loss; 2) the manner of death/loss will affect the grieving process; 3) the age and living situation of the bereaved will affect the grieving process.&lt;ref&gt;Death and Dying, Life and Living By Charles A. Corr, Clyde Nabe, Donna M. Corr p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

University of Michigan did a study of grief over loss of a pet, the study included 174 adults who had lost their pets. Participants were administered a modified CENSHARE Pet Attachment Survey. Results indicate that initially 85.7% of owners experienced at least one symptom of grief, but the occurrence decreased to 35.1% at six months and to 22.4% at one year. Males and females reported different rates on six of 12 symptoms surveyed. The severity and length of symptoms is significantly correlated with the degree of attachment to the deceased pet. These findings indicate that pet loss can be a potential area of clinical concern, especially if the person's attachment to the pet was strong.&lt;ref&gt;Grieving Pet Death: Normative, Gender, and Attachment Issues. Wrobel, T. A., &amp; Dye, A. L. (2015, October 25)&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Coping with death===
Though well-meaning phrases like "time heals all wounds" can simply upset the grieving pet owner, it is true that the one factor required for all coping strategies is time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kw6AOmp7pi8C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=animal+loss+coping&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=animal%20loss%20coping&amp;f=false Coping with Sorrow on the Loss of Your Pet By Moira Anderson Allen, p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; Coping also involves understanding the emotions surrounding the loss of a pet, and then accepting the emotions to focus towards positive solutions.

Coping strategies may include:&lt;ref&gt;Coping with Sorrow on the Loss of Your Pet By Moira Anderson Allen&lt;/ref&gt;
* Going through the grieving process
* Strengthening positive memories
[[File:Gabe, missing dog.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Typical posting for a lost pet]]
* Seeking support from resources, organizations and individuals
* Seeking solace from one's own spiritual beliefs
* Preparing for a pet's death in advance

===Types of loss===
There are several special types of loss:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jjjct0jqpw0C&amp;pg=PA63 Pet Loss and Children: Establishing a Healthy Foundation By Cheri Barton Ross, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjWs4PwnkWwC&amp;pg=PA54 |title=Pet Loss And Human Emotion: Guiding Clients Through Grief - Cheri Ross - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pet is missing (considered an unresolved loss)
* Pet is lost through divorce/separation
* Pet is accidentally injured or killed
* Pet is willfully injured or killed
* Pet is [[theft|stolen]]
* Pet dies naturally
* Pet is [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]]
* Pet becomes very ill

===Getting a new animal===
One caveat is to carefully consider timing bringing a new pet into the home.&lt;ref&gt;Coping with Sorrow on the Loss of Your Pet By Moira Anderson Allen, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it is recommended to consider where the bereaved is in the grieving process.&lt;ref&gt;Starting Out Right with Your New Dog: A Complete Guide, by Susan McCullough, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Choose the new pet for its own unique qualities rather than trying to replace the former pet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cloud9vets.co.uk/how-to-cope-with-the-loss-of-a-pet/ "How To Cope With The Loss Of A Pet?"], Cloud 9 Vets, accessed April 4, 2011;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pet cloning===
A recent trend has seen some pet owners getting [[Cloning|clones]] made of their deceased pets. A new [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]] show called ''[[I Cloned My Pet]]'' profiles some of these pet owners who want nothing more than the return of their original pets. For these pet owners, nothing will do but the original, and people will pay up to $100,000 for a cloning. Some people shown on the show waited for over ten years for the return of their pet.

===Workplace issues===
Pet illness and death is gradually becoming recognized as similar to other forms of sickness and death in the family. In the UK, a variety of companies provide paid leave for such eventualities,&lt;ref&gt;"A number of large businesses have begun to allow their employees 'peternity' leave, in order to look after sick pets or take them to the vets. London delivery company [[The Courier Service]] introduced a "peternity" policy last July that lets workers claim two days' paid annual leave. Denise Fresco, human resources manager, said: 'It is awarded in the same way people might need time off for a baby or to look after a child.' Meanwhile, the [[Bank of Scotland]] allow workers to take time off work for sick pets, so long as they organise cover. [[Royal Mail]] has also said that it will consider allowing 'compassionate leave' if a pet dies." [http://www.workplacelaw.net/display.php?resource_id=8203&amp;a_id=1943 workplacelaw.com Jan 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; with employment tribunals backing this in some instances where employment terms did not specifically mention pet loss.&lt;ref&gt;"In September 2006, Royal Mail had to pay employee David Portman an undisclosed amount for firing him after he took a week off work following the death of his dog. The week's absence, the last in a series of absences, happened in 2004 and Portman was dismissed from his job as a result. Portman’s lawyer argued that many of the previous absences were a result of workplace injuries and that Royal Mail's own procedures say that time off following bereavement is not counted against an employee's sickness record. The [[employment tribunal|tribunal]] ruled Portman had been off for legitimate reasons and that Royal Mail had failed to understand and apply its own policy." [http://www.workplacelaw.net/display.php?resource_id=8203&amp;a_id=1943 workplacelaw.com Jan 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies by insurers suggest that up to one in four pet owners are sufficiently affected by pet loss or illness to take time off, but that many feel this will be treated lightly and hence simply state they were sick. According to [[Petplan UK|Petplan]], 35% of people admitted to taking time off work to either settle new pets into the home or care for sick pets, and half of those admitted taking a whole week off,&lt;ref name="workpplacelaw"&gt;[http://www.workplacelaw.net/display.php?resource_id=8203&amp;a_id=1943 workplacelaw.com Jan 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; and according to [[Direct Line]] one in four pet owners "said they have been too upset to go into the workplace when their four legged friend died" and "many of those who did go into work after the death of their pet said they were unproductive." &lt;ref&gt;The London Paper (''thelondonpaper.com'') and The Scotsman, 9 Feb: survey of 1100 dog owners by Direct Line.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter survey also noted that pet owners in the UK take "around 8 days off" due to grief at the death of a pet, and that "seventy-nine percent of people responding to the survey admitted they did not think their boss would be sympathetic, and the only way they could get time off work was by... pretending to be ill." &lt;ref name="workpplacelaw" /&gt;

==Pet loss resources==
Resources for pet loss change regularly, but include [[grief counseling]], [[support groups]], [[online forums]], hotlines and books.  The Pet Loss Support Page maintains an updated list of recommended resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pet-loss.net The Pet Loss Support].&lt;/ref&gt;

Resources include:
* Hotlines: Several veterinary schools around the United States have pet loss support hotlines, as well as various nonprofit agencies.
* Online forums: Internet search engines using "pet loss support" as a search term will locate several online forums available for grieving pet owners. Also, there are digital memorial websites for pets. The online community allows you to create a profile, compiling images, details, and memories of your pet in one place.
* Books: Books on pet loss are published regularly
* Grief Counseling: Therapists with training in grief therapy can be located in local communities. In addition, therapists may also include support groups that meet regularly to discuss issues surrounding pet loss. 
*Hospices: Some hospices offer grief support 
* Websites - Organizations may have webpages with various resources for grieving pet owners

==Beliefs about non-human death==
[[File:Louvre egyptologie 21.jpg|right|thumb|A [[mummy|mummified]] cat]]
Some world religions have held that beloved pets will join their families in an [[afterlife]]. [[Animal worship]] was common in the ancient world, influencing the burial practices of animals. [[Animal mummy|Animal mummification]] was practiced in Ancient Egypt, and  gave [[Cats in ancient Egypt|special significance to cats]] in some areas. Egyptians believed that mummification was imperative in order to gain admittance to the afterlife, and therefore the belief was that the mummification of these pets would ensure the animals’ immortality.&lt;ref name=Dunand&gt;[[Dunand, Francoise]], Roger Lichtenberg, and Jean Yoyotte. Mummies and Death in Egypt. New York: Cornell University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Ancient Egyptian families believed that mummified pets would keep the deceased company in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=Lawrence&gt;Lawrence, Susan V. "Unraveling the Mysteries of the Mummies." Science News, Society for Science and the Public 118 (1980): 362-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common Egyptian pets included cats, dogs, mongooses, monkeys, gazelles, and birds. Many Egyptians loved their pets, and the customary process of mourning the loss of a loved pet included crying and shaving one’s eyebrows. Ancient Egyptian pets were given names like we name our pets today, evidenced by over 70 names deciphered inscriptions identifying pet dog mummies.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;Arnold, Dorothea. "An Egyptian Bestiary." The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin new 52 (1995): 1-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[religion]]s are divided as to whether non-human animals are believed to have [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s, [[reincarnation|reincarnate]] or none, and also whether animals will exist in the afterlife.

In the absence of a common religious belief, many pet owners have embraced the concept of the [[Rainbow Bridge (pets)|Rainbow Bridge]].  The concept, the origin of which is not clearly known, speaks of a [[metaphor]]ical or [[mythology|mythical]] place of reunion where pets that die live in a [[paradise|paradisical]] version of [[limbo]], [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenated]] and free of pain and suffering, until their companion humans arrive upon their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=shAHJQwXslYC&amp;pg=PA389 Planet Cat: A CAT-alog by Sandra Choron, Harry Choron, Arden Moore, p. 389]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petsinpeace.com.au/online_memorials "Online Memorials"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407092947/http://www.petsinpeace.com.au/online_memorials |date=April 7, 2011 }}, An analysis of Pets in Peace online memorials reveals 30% express a desire or belief that they will be re-united in an afterlife, this includes 2% that explicitly mention the Rainbow Bridge, breakdown calculated April 9, 2011;&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the pet(s) run to their companion humans, and they enter [[heaven]] together, never to be parted again.

In [[Mormonism]], all [[organism]]s (as well as the entire planet [[Earth]]) are believed to have a [[spirit]], but that beings without the gift of [[free agency (Mormonism)|free agency]] (the ability to know and choose between right and wrong) are innocent and unblemished spirits who go straight to [[Heaven]] when they die.&lt;ref&gt;[[Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith]], p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals will be resurrected.&lt;ref&gt;Sacred Truths of the Doctrine and Covenants Vol. II, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Animal chaplains]] are becoming increasingly popular for helping the bereaved family members deal with the loss of their pet to provide memorial services, spiritual reassurance, and grief counseling.

'''Anspert''' (died 7 December 881) was [[archbishop of Milan]] from 861 to 881.

==Biography==
Despite the tradition that he was a member of the Confalonieri family, this is not confirmed. When he was not a bishop yet, Anspert received by [[Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Louis II]] the asset of Ansprand, who had killed the monarch's brother.

He was appointed archbishop of Milan on 26 June 868 and under Louis II he was ''[[missus dominicus]]''. An educated man, he asked Irish monks to found the archbishop's ''scriptorium'' in [[Milan]], a center for production of [[illuminated manuscript]]s. On 12 August 875, he moved to [[Brescia]], where the emperor had just died, and organized his sepulture in the [[basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In the January of the following year he participated to the coronation of [[Charles the Bald]] in [[Pavia]], and received by the new king further territories at  [[Cavenago]], [[Vimercate]] and [[Ornago]]. In July 877 he took part in a council at [[Ravenna]] in which he obtained several privileges for the Milanese archbishopric.

After the Charles the Bald's death (877), Anspert entered in conflict with [[Pope John VIII]], who favored [[Boso of Vienne]] as King of Italy, while the Milanese proposed [[Carloman of Bavaria]]. On 1 June 879 he was excommunicated and, in the following October, deposed; however, Anspert remained in charge as the Milanese clergymen supported him. Anspert and John reconciled when they met at the coronation of [[Charles the Fat]] as King of Italy (6 January 880) at Ravenna.

During his tenure as archbishop the church of Milan was named as ''Ambrosian''

Anspert died at Milan in December 881 and was buried in the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio|church of Sant'Ambrogio]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3940">'''Asada no Yasu''' (麻田陽春) was a poet in Japan's [[Nara period]] who composed both ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'' (poetry in Japanese) and ''[[kanshi (poetry)|kanshi]]'' (poetry in Chinese).

== Biography ==
Asada no Yasu was active in the [[Nara period]] of Japanese history.{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}} His birth and death dates are unknown.{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}}

He was a member of the immigrant Tōhon clan (答本氏),{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}} and was originally named Tōhon no Yasu,{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}} but in the [[Japanese calendar|fifth month]] of [[Jinki (era)|Jinki 1]] (724) was given the surname Asada and the hereditary title [[Muraji]], and so became Asada no Muraji Yasu (麻田連陽春).{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}} At this time, he held the court rank of [[List of Japanese court ranks, positions and hereditary titles#Eighth Rank|Senior Eighth Rank, Upper Grade]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}}

It is known that by 730 he was working in [[Dazaifu, Fukuoka|Dazaifu]] under [[Ōtomo no Tabito]],{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}} and had attained the [[List of Japanese court ranks, positions and hereditary titles#Sixth Rank|Junior Sixth Rank, Lower Grade]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}}

In the first month of 739 he was promoted to the Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade.{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}} According to the ''[[Kaifūsō]]'', during the time he held this rank he became the governor of [[Iwami Province]],{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}} and this was in his [[East Asian age reckoning#Japanese|fifty-sixth year]], but it is unclear when that was.{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}}

He probably lived until around 749.{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}}

== Poetry ==
=== ''Waka'' ===
Four of his ''[[tanka]]'' (the name used for ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'' in the standard 5-7-5-7-7 metre in the pre-[[Heian period]]) were included in the ''[[Man'yōshū]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}} These poems were number 569 and 570 (book 4), and 884 and 885 (book 5).{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}} All of these poems were composed during his time at Dazaifu.{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}} Poems 884 and 885 are accompanied by responses from the poet [[Yamanoue no Okura]], so it is clear he had some amount of literary engagement with that poet.{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}}

His socializing with both Tabito and Okura while they were in [[Tsukushi Province|Tsukushi]] has led to speculation that he may have been involved in the compilation of an early form of what became book 5 of the ''Man'yōshū''.{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1pp=41–42}}

=== ''Kanshi'' ===
One ofhis ''[[kanshi (poetry)|kanshi]]'' was included in the ''Kaifūsō''.{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=41}}

He wrote a response to a ''kanshi'' composed by [[Fujiwara no Nakamaro]] during the time the latter was governor of [[Ōmi Province]] (a position he was granted in the ninth month of 747), and this appears to have been composed toward the end of his life.{{sfnm|1a1=Kojima|1y=1983|1p=42}}

'''''Baby Pals''''' is a [[simulation game|simulation-style]] [[video game]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] developed by American studio Brain Toys that released in North America and in the [[PAL]]  region in late 2007 and early 2008. The objective of the game is to take care of a virtual baby through certain tasks as feeding, bathing, and teaching just like a real father or mother would do. Players can choose the gender of the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pocketgamer.com/articles/006694/baby-pals/|title=Baby Pals|last=Brice|first=Kath|date=May 2, 2008|website=Pocket Gamer|accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/11/baby-pals-review|title=Baby Pals Review|last=Thomas|first=Lucas|date=January 10, 2008|website=IGN|accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged subliminal message==
According to news reports, a mother who purchased the game for her child reported that the babies in the game say something that sounds like "[[Islam]] is the light" under certain circumstances. The babies in the game generally do not have any spoken dialog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wpri.com/dpp/news/strange_news/offbeat_wthi_terrehaute_islam_is_the_light_nintendo_0126200921532177991|title=Video game plays strange message?|last=Hayes|first=Jessica|date=2009-01-27|publisher=WPRI|accessdate=2009-02-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225064058/http://www.wpri.com/dpp/news/strange_news/offbeat_wthi_terrehaute_islam_is_the_light_nintendo_0126200921532177991| archivedate=February 25, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a representative from the game's publisher, [[Crave Entertainment]], the sound bit came from "a recording of a 5-month-old baby babbling non-intelligible phrases." He pointed out that "the baby being recorded was too young to pronounce these words let alone a whole grammatically correct phrase."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/01/30/crave-responds-to-baby-pals-controversy|title=Crave responds to Baby Pals controversy|last=Fletcher|first=JC|date=2009-01-30|publisher=joystiq|accessdate=2009-02-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090202061106/http://www.joystiq.com/2009/01/30/crave-responds-to-baby-pals-controversy| archivedate= 2 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beatrice d'Este''' (29 June 1475 &amp;ndash; 3 January 1497), was duchess of [[Bari]] and Milan by marriage to [[Ludovico Sforza]] (known as "il Moro"). She was reputed as one of the most beautiful and accomplished princesses of the Italian [[Renaissance]]. A member of the [[House of Este|Este]] family, she was the younger daughter of [[Ercole I d'Este]] and the sister of [[Isabella d'Este]] and [[Alfonso d'Este]]. Along with her sister, Beatrice was noted for her excellent taste in fashion and for having invented new clothing styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muralti|first=F.|title=Annalia|year=1861|location=Milan|pages=54|quote=Anno Christi MCDLXXXXVII Beatrix Herculis Ducis Ferrariae filia ac Ludovici Sfortiae Mediolani Ducis uxor hoc anno tertio ianuarii ex infelici partu suum diem clausit extremum, duobus post se natis masculis relictis; quae erat in iuvenili aetate, formosa ac nigri coloris, novarum vestium inventrix, die noctuque stans in choreis ac deliciis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
=== Marriage ===
The Ferrarese house of Este and the Milanese house of Sforza had always been on friendly terms and in 1490, in order to cement an alliance, Ludovico Sforza formally asked Ercole d'Este to give him the hand of his daughter in marriage. Ludovico, who was then duke of Bari and regent to the [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza|duke of Milan]], had originally requested a betrothal to Isabella, Beatrice's older sister, but because she was already promised to [[Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua|Francesco Gonzaga]], Ercole offered him Beatrice instead.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (1903), pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Il Moro made no objection to the arrangement and Beatrice was married to him in January 1491.

The official nuptials were to have taken place in 1490 in a double wedding with Beatrice marrying Ludovico and Isabella marrying Francesco at the same time, but the Duke of Bari postponed it more than once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shell|first1=Janice|last2=Sironi|first2=Grazioso|title=Cecilia Gallerani: Leonardo's Lady with an Ermine|journal=Artibus et Historiae|year=1992|volume=13|issue=25|pages=47–66 pp.57|doi=10.2307/1483456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, around a year later, they were wed in a double Sforza-Este wedding: Ludovico married Beatrice, while Beatrice's brother, Alfonso d'Este, married [[Anna Sforza]], the sister of [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza]]. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] orchestrated the wedding celebration.

=== Duchess of Milan ===
[[File:Pavia Certosa Interno 1.jpg|thumb|220px|Tomb of Ludovico il Moro and Beatrice d'Este by [[Cristoforo Solari]].]]
Beatrice had been carefully educated, and availed herself of her position as mistress of one of the most splendid courts of Italy to gather around her learned men, poets and artists, such as [[Niccolò da Correggio]], Bernardo Castiglione, [[Donato Bramante]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and many others.

In 1492 she visited Venice as ambassador for her husband in his political schemes, which consisted chiefly of a desire to be recognized as duke of Milan. On the death of [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza]], Ludovico's usurpation was legalized, and after the [[Battle of Fornovo]] (1495), both he and his wife took part in the peace congress of Vercelli between [[Charles VIII of France]] and the Italian princes, at which Beatrice showed great political ability.

However, her brilliant career was cut short by death through childbirth, on 3 January 1497 at the age of 21. In a letter written hours after her death, Ludovico informed his brother-in-law Francesco Gonzaga that his wife, "gave back her spirit to God" half an hour after midnight. Their child had been born at eleven at night and was a stillborn son.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (1903), pp. 307–308&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Issue ===
* [[Massimiliano Sforza]] (25 January 1493 – 4 June 1530), duke of Milan 1512–1515.
* [[Francesco II Sforza]] (4 February 1495 – 24 October 1535), duke of Milan 1521–1535.
* Stillborn son (3 January 1497).

== Legacy ==
Beatrice d'Este belonged to the best class of Renaissance women, and was one of the cultural influences of the age; to a great extent, her patronage and good taste are responsible for the splendour of the [[Castello Sforzesco]] in Milan, the Certosa of [[Pavia]], and many other famous buildings in Lombardy. Her tomb is preserved in the [[Certosa di Pavia]] where she is buried beside her husband [[Ludovico Sforza]].

== ''Ritratto di dama'' ==
Beatrice d'Este is very often mistaken as the sitter of ''[[:File:Ambrogio de Predis - Ritratto di una dama.jpg|Ritratto di dama]]'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis|Ambrogio de Predis]] at the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in Milan. Investigations between 2010 and 2013 by [[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Martin Kemp]]/{{Interlanguage link multi|Pascal Cotte|fr}} and a German researcher brought to light strong evidence that the true sitter of the painting is not Beatrice d'Este but [[Anna Sforza]].&lt;ref&gt;Reimann, Sascha: "''Ritratto di dama'' (Ambrosiana Milan) The Sitter – The Painter – New Evidences", [[sine loco|s.l.]], December 2013; see also Kemp, Martin/Cotte, Pascal, 2010. ''La Bella Principessa''. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; A historically confirmed profile portrait of Beatrice d'Este can be found in the ''[[:File:Pala sforzesca.jpg|Pala Sforzesca]]''. Another authentic document of Beatrice d'Este's appearance can be found in a bust by [[Giovanni Cristoforo Romano]] in the early 1490s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Literature and Music==
* In ''[[The Second Mrs. Giaconda]]'', a novel by [[E. L. Konigsburg]], her dull appearance is crucial. "She's small and dark and perfectly plain", the main character says when he first sees her; when they meet she is "trying to get the sun to make me blond and beautiful"; when she meets [[Leonardo da Vinci]] she laments her "plain brown wrapping"; and so on.&lt;ref&gt;
Konigsburg, E.L. (1975). ''The Second Mrs. Giaconda''. [[Atheneum Books]]. pp. 38, 51, 59, passim. {{ISBN|0-689-30480-3}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; She overcomes her looks and after death one of her insights becomes a cause of Da Vinci's ''[[Mona Lisa]]''.{{Clarify|date=December 2013|post-text="One of her insights becomes a cause"?}}
* In the novel ''Duchess of Milan'' author Michael Ennis explores Beatrice d'Este's tenure as Duchess of Bari and eventually as first lady of Milan as well as her friendship and rivalry with Isabella of Aragon.
* The French composer [[Reynaldo Hahn]] evokes her court in his 1905 suite for winds, piano, winds, two harps, and percussion, ''Le Bal de Béatrice d'Este.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2548">'''Birgitte Sofie Gabel''' (1746–1769) was a Danish noble.

She was the daughter of Baron Verner Rosenkrantz and Else Margrete Sehested and married the courtier and noble Kristian Karl Gabel in 1762. She was known for her beauty and admired for her great intelligence and intellectual ability. The contemporary memoir writer count Rantzau-Ascheberg described her as a woman whose education and great scholarly knowledge could be compared to that of most men.  
She was given the [[Ordre de l'Union Parfaite]] in 1764. 
 
It was noted that [[Christian VII of Denmark]] found her attractive and attempted to seduce her. In 1767, the circle around [[Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain]], wished to make her the official mistress of the monarch in order to divert him from politics and take over the [[de facto]] power over the government themselves.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;August Fjelstrup: ''[https://archive.org/stream/damernevedkaroli00fjel/damernevedkaroli00fjel_djvu.txt Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof]'', 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan failed because Gabel did not wish to become the king's mistress, as she found him repulsive and was in love with [[Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The same year, [[Støvlet-Cathrine]] became the king's official mistress, but was exiled the following year.  
 
According to contemporary reports, [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]] attempted to make her the official royal mistress of the king in 1769, claiming that it would benefit the mentally ill king's health to have an intelligent woman as a lover, and the nation, as it would make the king more easy to control.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Reportedly, it was also Struensee's plan to become the lover of Gabel and through her control the king politically.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Gabel made an attempt to be more encouraging to the king's attraction for her than she had been before, but after observing that the king's health and behavior did not improve and would likely not improve if she became his lover, she refused to go through with it.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; During her brief relation with the king, she reportedly tried to influence him to get rid of his favorite [[Conrad Holck]], whom she despised.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

She died in childbirth after having given birth to a dead daughter in mid-August 1769.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Caesar''' (1898–1914) was a [[Wire Fox Terrier]] owned by [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]]. He was bred in the kennels of [[Kathleen, Duchess of Newcastle]], and became the constant companion of the King. After the King's death in 1910, the dog attended [[Funeral of Edward VII|the funeral]] and walked in the procession in prominence ahead of nine kings and other heads of state. Caesar has been the subject of paintings, and a hand crafted [[Hardstone carving|hardstone model]] created by the [[House of Fabergé]].

==Early life==
Caesar was born Caesar of Notts in 1898, and was sired by Cackler of Notts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vanderlip|first=Sharon|title=Fox Terriers|year=2001|publisher=Barron's|location=Hauppauge, NY|isbn=978-0-7641-1636-0|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UDZCPG1D1cgC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%22caesar+of+notts%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KqtP-opzc0&amp;sig=qFcUYcJaCuH9WoJuyurhzgldYq4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BcspT6ycIZG08QPGnZzKAw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22caesar%20of%20notts%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came from the kennels of [[Kathleen, Duchess of Newcastle]], and was given to King [[Edward VII]] by [[Lord Dudley]] in 1902 to replace the King's dog Jack who had died after choking on food.&lt;ref name=companion&gt;{{cite news|last=Waters|first=Nick|title=The King’s companion|url=http://www.dogworld.co.uk/Features/25-Waters-(2)?year=2011&amp;month=06|accessdate=1 February 2012|newspaper=Dog World|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal life==
During his life with the King, he had a [[footman]] assigned to him to clean him and was allowed to sleep on an easy chair next to the King's bed. He wore a collar that read "I am Caesar. I belong to the King".&lt;ref name=edwardlastvictorian&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbert|first=Christopher|title=Edward VII: The Last Victorian King|year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4039-8377-0|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AB2Ub-5gvJ4C&amp;pg=PT246&amp;lpg=PT246&amp;dq=Edward+VII+caesar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ytak3WCsAy&amp;sig=Kk0uDLh7EuDTB_EkouVpRmzWdlY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UqQpT4KxDIym8gPKoJ3VAw&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breed History|url=http://www.aftc.org/History.aspx|publisher=American Fox Terrier Club|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I used not to take the slightest notice and went on talking all the time to the King which I think amused His Majesty still more."&lt;ref name=edwardlastvictorian/&gt; Caesar frequently caused problems for the King, escaping in [[Marienbad]] whilst chasing white [[peafowl]] and on another occasion killing rabbits owned by [[Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale|Lord Redesdale]]'s daughters. The King even considered Caesar to be an obstacle to the [[Entente Cordiale]].&lt;ref name=companion /&gt; He asked his personal attendant, Lawrence Wrightson, to look after Caesar should he die before the dog.&lt;ref name=shaggy&gt;{{cite news|title=More shaggy dog stories...|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/10648636.More_shaggy_dog_stories______/|accessdate=3 January 2016|work=The Northern Echo|date=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The King ordered [[Hardstone carving|hardstone models]] of his favourite dogs and racehorses from the [[House of Fabergé]]. Caesar was at the King's side on the Norfolk estate when the initial wax models were revealed by the company. The model of Caesar was made of [[chalcedony]], [[rubies]], enamel and gold, and included Caesar's collar in the design. The finished model did not arrive until after the King's death, and was purchased by Dame [[Margaret Greville]], who gave the figure to [[Queen Alexandra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Highlights from the Royal Fabergé Exhibition|url=http://www.faberge.com/news/20-highlights-from-the-royal-faberg-exhibition.aspx?p=1|publisher=House of Fabergé|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A painting of the dog was also created by [[Reuben Ward Binks]] for the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=31 Dog Paintings by Royal Artist from Bolton to sell at Bonhams|url=http://www.bonhams.com/eur/press/6437/|publisher=Bonhams|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Frohman''' (July 15, 1856&amp;nbsp;– May 7, 1915) was an American theatrical producer. Frohman was producing plays by 1889 and acquired his first [[Broadway theatre]] by 1892. He discovered and promoted many stars of the American theatre.

In 1896, Frohman co-founded the [[Theatrical Syndicate]], which grew to exert monopoly control over the U.S. theatre industry for nearly two decades. He also leased the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in London, promoting such playwrights as [[J. M. Barrie]], producing Barrie's ''[[Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'', which he debuted at the Duke of York's in December 1904 and opened  in the U.S. in January 1905. The American opening starred a Frohman favorite, [[Maude Adams]]. He partnered with English producers, including [[Seymour Hicks]], with whom he produced a string of London hits prior to 1910, including ''[[Quality Street (play)|Quality Street]]'', ''[[The Admirable Crichton]]'', ''[[The Catch of the Season]]'', ''[[The Beauty of Bath]]'', and ''[[A Waltz Dream]]''. Many of his London successes also enjoyed runs in New York.

Frohman produced over 700 shows.  At the height of his career, he died in the 1915 sinking of the [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']].

==Life and career==
Charles Frohman was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;Klawans, Stuart. [https://forward.com/articles/5466/finding-an-audience-years-of-invisibility "Finding an Audience: Years of Invisibility"], ''[[The Forward]]'', April 9, 2004, accessed December 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Sandusky, Ohio]], the youngest of three [[Frohman brothers]], including [[Daniel Frohman|Daniel]] and [[Gustave Frohman|Gustave]]. The year of his birth date is generally erroneously reported as 1860, and his birthday is shown as July 16 on his tombstone, but the correct date is July 15, 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Certified Birth Certificate, Sandusky, Ohio; and the 1860 Federal Census for Sandusky, Ohio, which shows: "Charley", age 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, Frohman's family moved to New York City. At the age of twelve, Frohman started to work at night in the office of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', attending school by day. In 1874, he began work for the ''Daily Graphic'' and at night sold tickets at [[Richard M. Hooley|Hooley]]'s Theatre, [[Brooklyn]]. In 1877, he took charge of the Chicago Comedy Co., with [[John Dillon (comedian)|John Dillon]] as star in ''Our Boys''. He next joined [[Haverly's United Mastodon Minstrels]] as manager, touring the U.S. and Europe. Then for a time he was associated with his brothers Daniel and Gustave in managing the [[Madison Square Theatre]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Frohman, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to produce plays by 1886.&lt;ref name=Kenrickbio&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/who21.htm#Frohman "Who's Who in Musicals: Additional Bios XI"]. Musicals101.com, 2004, accessed May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Outcast.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''The Outcast'' (1917)]]
Frohman's first success as a producer was with [[Bronson Howard]]'s play ''[[Shenandoah (1889 play)|Shenandoah]]'' (1889). Frohman founded the Empire Theatre Stock Company to acquire his first Broadway theatre, the [[Empire Theatre (41st Street)|Empire]], in 1892. The following year, he produced his first [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play, [[Clyde Fitch|Clyde Fitch's]] ''Masked Ball''. In this piece, [[Maude Adams]] first played opposite [[John Drew, Jr.|John Drew]], which led to many future successes. Soon Frohman  acquired five other New York City theaters, including the [[Garrick Theatre (New York City)|Garrick]] and Criterion Theatres. Working with [[William Harris (theatrical producer)|William Harris]] and Isaac B. Rich, he became part owner of their theatres in Boston (the [[Columbia Theatre (Boston)|Columbia Theatre]], [[Park Theatre (Boston)|Park]], [[Hollis Street Theatre|Hollis Street]], [[Colonial Theatre (Boston, Massachusetts)|Colonial]], [[Boston Theatre|Boston]] and [[Tremont Theatre, Boston (1889)|Tremont]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper &amp; Brothers| last1 = Marcosson| first1 = Isaac Frederick| last2 = Frohman| first2 = Daniel| title = Charles Frohman: Manager and Man| date = 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, he produced the New York premiere of ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', by [[Oscar Wilde]]. The same year, he produced ''[[The Shop Girl]]''.&lt;ref name=Kenrickbio/&gt;

Frohman was known for his ability to develop talent. His stars included [[William Gillette]], [[John Drew, Jr.]], [[Ethel Barrymore]], [[Billie Burke]], [[E. H. Sothern]], [[Julia Marlowe]], [[Maude Adams]], [[Paul Gilmore]], [[Evelyn Millard]], [[Henry Miller (actor)|Henry Miller]] and [[Walter E. Perkins]].  In 1896, Frohman, [[Al Hayman]], [[Abe Erlanger]], [[Marcus Klaw|Mark Klaw]], [[Samuel F. Nixon]], and [[J. Fred Zimmerman, Sr.|Fred Zimmerman]] formed the [[Theatrical Syndicate]]. Their organization established systemized booking networks throughout the United States and created a monopoly that controlled every aspect of contracts and bookings until the late 1910s, when the [[Shubert brothers]] broke their stranglehold on the industry.

In 1897, Frohman leased the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in London, introducing plays there as well as in the United States. [[Clyde Fitch]], [[J. M. Barrie]] and [[Edmond Rostand]] were among the playwrights he promoted. As a producer, among Frohman's most famous successes was Barrie's ''[[Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'', which he premiered at the Duke of York's in December 1904 starring [[Nina Boucicault]], and produced in January 1905 in the U.S. starring [[Maude Adams]]. In the early years of the 20th century, Frohman also established a successful partnership with English actor-producer [[Seymour Hicks]] to produce musicals and other comedies in London, including ''[[Quality Street (play)|Quality Street]]'' in 1902, ''[[The Admirable Crichton]]'' in 1903, ''[[The Catch of the Season]]'' in 1904, ''[[The Beauty of Bath]]'' in 1906, ''[[The Gay Gordons (musical)|The Gay Gordons]]'' in 1907, and ''[[A Waltz Dream]]'' in 1908, among others.  He also partnered with other London theatre managers. The system of exchange of successful plays between London and New York was effected largely as a result of his efforts. In 1910, Frohman attempted a repertory scheme of producing plays at the Duke of York's. He advertised a bill of plays by [[J. M. Barrie]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[Harley Granville Barker]], and others. The venture began tentatively, and while it may have proved successful, Frohman canceled the scheme when London theatres closed at the death of [[King Edward VII]] in May 1910.

Other Frohman hits included ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'' (1909), ''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]'' (1910), ''[[The Sunshine Girl]]'' (1913) and ''[[The Girl From Utah]]'' (1914).&lt;ref name=Kenrickbio/&gt;  By 1915, Frohman had produced more than 700 shows, employed an average of 10,000 people per season, 700 of them actors, and paid salaries totaling $35 million a year (the equivalent of more than $700 million in 2010 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;Zecher, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Frohman controlled five theaters in London, six in New York City, and over two hundred throughout the rest of the United States. His longtime live-in companion, theatre critic Charles Dillingham (1868–1934), also became a well-known producer.&lt;ref name=Kenrickbio/&gt;

==Death on the RMS ''Lusitania''==
[[Image:Charles Frohman of the Callender Minstrels, 1883.jpg|thumb|right|Frohman (center, right) as co-proprietor of the Callender Minstrels, 1883]]
Frohman made his annual trip to Europe in May 1915 to oversee his London and Paris "play markets", sailing on the Cunard Line's [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']]. Songwriter [[Jerome Kern]] was meant to accompany him on the voyage, but overslept after being kept up late playing requests at a party.&lt;ref&gt;Denison, pp. 21–22; and McLean, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Gillette]] was also to have accompanied him, but was forced to fulfill a contracted appearance in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Zecher, p. 442; ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', "The Call Boy's Chat," February 7, 1930, Theatres, Music, Radio, Radio Programs Section, p. TH1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frohman's rheumatic knee, from a fall three years earlier, had been ailing for most of the voyage, but he was feeling better on the morning of May 7, a bright, sunny day. He entertained guests in his suite and later at his table. He was regaling them with tales of his life in the theater when, at 2:10 in the afternoon, within fourteen miles of the [[Old Head of Kinsale]], with the coast of Ireland in sight, a torpedo from the German [[U-boat]] ''U-20'' struck the ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'' on the starboard side. Within a minute, there was a second explosion, followed by several smaller ones.&lt;ref&gt;The distance of the sinking from the Old Head of Kinsale varies among sources, ranging from 8 to 14 miles; the most reliable figure may be the 14 miles noted by Kapitänleutnant Walther Schwieger in his log. The second explosion had long been attributed to explosive munitions ignited by the torpedo, but shipwreck explorer Robert Ballard attributed the second major explosion to exploding coal dust.  See Ballard, Robert. ''Exploring the Lusitania'' (Warner/Madison Press Book, 1995), p. 195.  [[Diana Preston]] attributed it to exploding steam lines.  See Preston, Diana, ''Lusitania, An Epic Tragedy'' (Walker &amp; Company, 2002), p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt;

As passengers began to panic, Frohman stood on the promenade deck, chatting with friends and smoking a cigar. He calmly remarked, "This is going to be a close call."&lt;ref&gt;Frohman and Marcosson, p. 386; Preston, p. 204; [http://rmslusitania.info/pages/saloon_class/frohman_charles.html "Frohman, Charles"]. The Lusitania Resource; Zecher, p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt;  Frohman, with a disabled leg and walking with a cane, could not have jumped from the deck into a lifeboat, so he was trapped. Instead, he and millionaire [[Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt|Alfred Vanderbilt]] tied lifejackets to "Moses baskets" containing infants who had been asleep in the nursery when the torpedo struck. Frohman then went out onto the deck, where he was joined by actress [[Rita Jolivet]], her brother-in-law George Vernon and Captain Alick Scott. In the final moments, they clasped hands and Frohman paraphrased his greatest hit, ''[[Peter Pan]]'': "Why fear death? It is the most beautiful adventure that life gives us."  Jolivet, the only survivor of Frohman's party, was standing with Frohman as the ship sank.  She later said, "with a tremendous roar a great wave swept along the deck. We were all divided in a moment, and I have not seen any of those brave men alive since."&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Frederick D. ''The Tragedy of the Lusitania'' (National Publishing Company, 1915), pp. 38–39; Preston, p. 204; "Frohman Calm; Not Concerned About Death, Welcomed It as Beautiful Adventure, He Told Friends at End," ''New York Tribune'', May 11, 1915, p. 3; Frohman and Marcosson, p. 387; Frohman, Charles. [http://www.rmslusitania.info/people/saloon/charles-frohman/ ''The Lusitania Resource"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Frohman died a month and a week short of his fifty-ninth birthday. His body was later washed ashore below the Old Head of Kinsale, and it was later determined that he was killed by a heavy object falling on him, rather than by drowning. His body lay among 147 others awaiting identification, where a rescued American identified it from newspaper photographs. His body, alone among all the others, was not disfigured.&lt;ref&gt;Frohman and Marcosson, p. 387; Survivor discovering Frohman's body quoted in Hoehling, Adolph A., ''The Last Voyage of the Lusitania'' (Random House Value Publishing, 1991), pp. 217–18; Ramsey, David, ''Lusitania, Saga and Myth'' (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001), pp. 96–97; ''New York American'', May 9, 1915, p. 1; ''New York Press'', "Finds Frohman's Body", May 9, 1915, p. 5; [http://www.rmslusitania.info/people/saloon/charles-frohman/ "Charles Frohman"]. ''The Lusitania Resource''; Zecher, p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;  His funeral service was held on May 25 at the [[Congregation Emanu-El of New York|Temple Emanu-El]] in New York City, and he was buried in the Union Field Cemetery in [[Ridgewood, Queens]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Tribune'', "Frohman Burial Plans, Two Funeral Services May 25; 8 Pallbearers Named," May 14, 1915, p. 5; pallbearers -- primary and honorary -- included [[Otis Skinner]], [[William Gillette]], [[Henry Miller]], [[E. H. Sothern]], [[William Faversham]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Augustus Thomas]], [[Edward Sheldon]], [[Henry Arthur Jones]], [[Paul M. Potter]], [[George Ade]] and [[Harry Leon Wilson]].  See Zecher, p. 443, 676.&lt;/ref&gt; Services were also arranged by some of his stars in other American cities: by [[Maude Adams]] in Los Angeles, by [[John Drew, Jr.|John Drew]] in San Francisco, by [[Billie Burke]] in Tacoma, and by [[Donald Brian]], [[Joseph Cawthorn]] and [[Julia Sanderson]] in Providence, as well as memorial services at both [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and the Church of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] in London. Frohman was also eulogized by the French Academy of Authors in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Frohman and Marcosson, pp. 389-90&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial to Frohman is located on The Causeway at [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] on Thames. The site features a fountain with a sculptured nymph and inscription.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, Jane.

==Portrayals in films, television and stage==
Frohman was portrayed by [[Harry Hayden]] in the film ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' in 1946. He was played by [[William Hootkins]] in the BBC mini-series ''[[The Lost Boys (TV series)|The Lost Boys]]'' in 1978. He was portrayed by [[Nehemiah Persoff]] in ''Ziegfeld: The Man &amp; His Women'' also in 1978 on television. In the 1980 film ''[[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]]'', the character William Fawcett Robinson, played by [[Christopher Plummer]], was based on Frohman.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Matthew R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11734">The '''classical limit''' or '''correspondence limit''' is the ability of a [[theoretical physics|physical theory]] to approximate or "recover" [[classical mechanics]] when considered over special values of its parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bohm |first=D. |author-link=David Bohm |year=1989 |title=Quantum Theory |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=0-486-65969-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical limit is used with physical theories that predict non-classical behavior.

==Quantum theory==
A [[heuristic]] postulate called the [[correspondence principle]] was introduced to [[Bohr model|quantum theory]] by [[Niels Bohr]]: in effect it states that some kind of continuity argument should apply to the classical limit of quantum systems as the value of [[Planck's constant]] normalized by the action of these systems becomes very small. Often, this is approached through "quasi-classical" techniques (cf. [[WKB approximation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Landau |first1=L. D. |author1-link=Lev Landau |last2=Lifshitz |first2=E. M. |author2-link=Evgeny Lifshitz |year=1977 |title=Quantum Mechanics: Non-Relativistic Theory |edition=3rd |volume=Vol. 3 |publisher=[[Pergamon Press]] |isbn=978-0-08-020940-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More rigorously,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hepp |first=K. |author1-link=Klaus Hepp |year=1974 |title=The classical limit for quantum mechanical correlation functions |url=http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.cmp/1103859623 |journal=[[Communications in Mathematical Physics]] |volume=35 |issue= 4|pages=265–277 |bibcode=1974CMaPh..35..265H |doi=10.1007/BF01646348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the mathematical operation involved in classical limits is a [[group contraction]], approximating physical systems where the relevant action is much larger than Planck's constant {{mvar|ħ}}, so the "deformation parameter" {{mvar|ħ}}/{{mvar|S}} can be effectively taken to be zero (cf. [[Weyl quantization]].) Thus typically, quantum commutators (equivalently, [[Moyal bracket]]s) reduce to [[Poisson bracket]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Curtright |first1=T. L. |last2=Zachos |first2=C. K. |year=2012 |title=Quantum Mechanics in Phase Space |journal=[[Asia Pacific Physics Newsletter]] |volume=1 |issue= |pages=37 |doi=10.1142/S2251158X12000069|arxiv=1104.5269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[group contraction]].

In [[quantum mechanics]], due to [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg's]] [[uncertainty principle]], an [[electron]] can never be at rest; it must always have a non-zero [[kinetic energy]], a result not found in classical mechanics. For example, if we consider something very large relative to an electron, like a baseball, the uncertainty principle predicts that it cannot really have zero kinetic energy, but the uncertainty in kinetic energy is so small that the baseball can effectively appear to be at rest, and hence it appears to obey classical mechanics. In general, if large energies and large objects (relative to the size and energy levels of an electron) are considered in quantum mechanics, the result will appear to obey classical mechanics. The typical [[occupation number]]s involved are huge: a macroscopic harmonic oscillator with {{mvar|ω}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;Hz, {{mvar|m}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;g, and maximum [[amplitude]] {{mvar|x}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;cm, has {{math|''S''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''E''/''ω''&amp;nbsp;≈ ''mωx''{{su|b=0|p=2}}/2&amp;nbsp;≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|ħn}}, so that {{mvar|n}}&amp;nbsp;≃&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;. Further see [[Coherent states#The wavefunction of a coherent state|coherent states]]. It is less clear, however, how the classical limit applies to chaotic systems, a field known as [[quantum chaos]].

Quantum mechanics and classical mechanics are usually treated with entirely different formalisms: quantum theory using [[Hilbert space]], and classical mechanics using a representation in [[phase space]]. One can bring the two into a common mathematical framework in various ways. In the [[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics, which is statistical in nature, logical connections between quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics are made, enabling natural comparisons between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bracken |first1=A. |last2=Wood |first2=J. |year=2006 |title=Semiquantum versus semiclassical mechanics for simple nonlinear systems |journal=[[Physical Review A]] |volume=73 |pages=012104 |arxiv=quant-ph/0511227 |bibcode=2006PhRvA..73a2104B |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.73.012104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Conversely, in the lesser-known [[Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics|approach presented in 1932 by Koopman and von Neumann]], the dynamics of classical mechanics have been formulated in terms of an [[operator (physics)|operational]] formalism in [[Hilbert space]], a formalism used conventionally for quantum mechanics.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In a crucial paper (1933), [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dirac |first=P.A.M. |author-link=Paul Dirac |year=1933 |title=The Lagrangian in quantum mechanics |url=http://www.ifi.unicamp.br/~cabrera/teaching/aula%2015%202010s1.pdf |journal=[[Physikalische Zeitschrift der Sowjetunion]] |volume=3 |issue= |pages=64–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; explained how classical mechanics is an [[Emergence#Non-living, physical systems|emergent phenomenon]] of quantum mechanics: [[Destructive interference#Quantum interference|destructive interference]] among paths with non-[[extremal]] macroscopic actions {{mvar|S}}&amp;nbsp;»&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|ħ}} obliterate amplitude contributions in the [[path integral formulation|path integral]] he introduced, leaving the extremal action {{mvar|S}}&lt;sub&gt;class&lt;/sub&gt;, thus the classical action path as the dominant contribution, an observation further elaborated by [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] in his 1942 PhD dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Feynman |first=R. P. |author-link=Richard Feynman |year=1942 |title=The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics |type=Ph.D. Dissertation |publisher=[[Princeton University]]}}

==Time-evolution of expectation values==
{{main|Ehrenfest theorem}}
One simple way to compare classical to quantum mechanics is to consider the time-evolution of the ''expected'' position and ''expected'' momentum, which can then be compared to the time-evolution of the ordinary position and momentum in classical mechanics. The quantum expectation values satisfy the [[Ehrenfest theorem]]. For a one-dimensional quantum particle moving in a potential &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, the Ehrenfest theorem says&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 3.7.5&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m\frac{d}{dt}\langle x\rangle = \langle p\rangle;\quad \frac{d}{dt}\langle p\rangle =  -\left\langle V'(X)\right\rangle .&lt;/math&gt;
Although the first of these equations is consistent with the classical mechanics, the second is not: If the pair &lt;math&gt;(\langle X\rangle,\langle P\rangle)&lt;/math&gt; were to satisfy Newton's second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have read
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\langle p\rangle =-V'\left(\left\langle X\right\rangle\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
But in most cases,
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle V'(X)\right\rangle\neq V'(\left\langle X\right\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;.
If for example, the potential &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is cubic, then &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; is quadratic, in which case, we are talking about the distinction between &lt;math&gt;\langle X^2\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle X\rangle^2&lt;/math&gt;, which differ by &lt;math&gt;(\Delta X)^2&lt;/math&gt;.

An exception occurs in case when the classical equations of motion are linear, that is, when &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is quadratic and &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; is linear. In that special case, &lt;math&gt;V'\left(\left\langle X\right\rangle\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle V'(X)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; do agree. In particular, for a free particle or a quantum harmonic oscillator, the expected position and expected momentum exactly follows solutions of Newton's equations.

For general systems, the best we can hope for is that the expected position and momentum will ''approximately'' follow the classical trajectories. If the wave function is highly concentrated around a point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;V'\left(\left\langle X\right\rangle\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle V'(X)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; will be ''almost'' the same, since both will be approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;V'(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;. In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will remain very close to the classical trajectories, at least ''for as long as'' the wave function remains highly localized in position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; 

Now, if the initial state is very localized in position, it will be very spread out in momentum, and thus we expect that the wave function will rapidly spread out, and the connection with the classical trajectories will be lost. When Planck's constant is small, however, it is possible to have a state that is well localized in ''both'' position and momentum. The small uncertainty in momentum ensures that the particle ''remains'' well localized in position for a long time, so that expected position and momentum continue to closely track the classical trajectories for a long time.

==Relativity and other deformations==
Other familiar deformations in physics involve:

*The deformation of classical Newtonian into relativistic mechanics ([[special relativity]]), with deformation parameter ''v/c''; the classical limit involves small speeds, so ''v/c''→0, and the systems appear to obey Newtonian mechanics.
*Similarly for the deformation of Newtonian gravity into [[general relativity]], with deformation parameter Schwarzschild-radius/characteristic-dimension, we find that objects once again appear to obey classical mechanics (flat space), when the mass of an object times the square of the [[Planck length]] is much smaller than its size and the sizes of the problem addressed.
*Wave optics might also be regarded as a deformation of [[geometrical optics|ray optics]] for deformation parameter ''λ/a''.
*Likewise, [[thermodynamics]] deforms to [[statistical mechanics]] with deformation parameter 1/''N''.

'''Clayton Counts''' was an American musician and composer, a former [[DJ]], and one half of the [[experimental music|experimental]] band [[Bull of Heaven (band)|Bull of Heaven]].

== Early life ==
Counts was born with detached retinas in both his eyes. A series of surgeries at a young age complicated this, leaving him blind in his right eye, and weakened in his left.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/last-night-a-dj-called-me-a-whinig-little-bitch/Content?oid=919465 Chicago Antisocial article in Chicago Reader]&lt;/ref&gt; Counts was initially located in [[Austin, TX|Austin, Texas]].

In the 1990s, Counts became notorious with his prank phone calls to the Austin Community Access Center, in particular [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]]'s show. An incident occurred - though with varying claims from both sides&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2000-07-14/77932/ Austin Chronicle: Alex Jones: Conspiracy Victim or Evil Mastermind?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102000000/http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2000-07-14/77932/ |date=January 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wingtv.net/thorn2006/jarhead.html World Independent News Group: Alex Jones-FBI Connection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202093404/http://www.wingtv.net/thorn2006/jarhead.html |date=2013-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; - in which Counts was involved in the [[assault]] of Jones in a parking lot with three other individuals. As a follow-up, it was claimed that Jones used [[FBI]] connections to label Counts a terrorist and claimed he possessed child pornography. Federal agents raided the [[FringeWare Review]] bookstore, headquarters of an early cyberculture magazine that Counts wrote articles for. The case was later dropped.

In 2000, Counts relocated to [[Chicago]]. Whilst there, he met [[Planes Mistaken for Stars|Neil Keener]], who would later join Counts in the band [[Bull of Heaven (band)|Bull of Heaven]].

== DJ work ==

In the 2000s, Counts worked as a DJ to afford a living. He worked at various clubs, including Lava, Whiskey Sky, Reserve, Darkroom, the Allstate Arena, as well as performing at private functions. In July 2005, Counts was again involved in an incident - this time the alleged [[battery (crime)|battery]] of a bouncer at the Lava club. Much like the Alex Jones incident in 2000, there are two sides to this story;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/last-night-a-dj-called-me-a-whinig-little-bitch/Content?oid=919465 Chicago Antisocial article in Chicago Reader]&lt;/ref&gt; Counts claims that he was told the set he was playing was "too loud" by club owner Brian Sarpalius (aka Phantom 45), who then subsequently interfered with and eventually unplugged Counts' equipment prior to having him removed by a bouncer. Sarpalius claims that it was actually Counts who caused a scene, and damaged the club's equipment. Counts allegedly discharged a can of [[mace (spray)|mace]] at the bouncer's feet as a warning shot, though the stories of this differ from both sides. Later in the night, Counts was arrested, and his equipment was lost for several days whilst it was in possession of another club-goer the night of the incident. Counts had been DJing at the Lava club for four years prior to Sarpalius becoming the new owner, and this incident ending his shows there. The charges against Counts were dropped after a lengthy court case.

== Musical career ==

In September 2006, Counts gained notoriety when he created a mash-up of [[The Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' with [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', aptly titled ''[[Sgt. Petsound's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' and credited to the band The Beachles. The [[mashup (music)|mash-up]] album was created in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of Pet Sounds, and was favoured by various sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://popwatch.ew.com/2006/09/05/meet_the_beachl/ Entertainment Weekly PopWatch: Meet the Beachles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2006/09/03/beachles-noise-mashu.html BoingBoing: Beachles - Noise Mashup of Beatles and Beach Boys]&lt;/ref&gt; This popularity reached [[EMI]], who in turn issued Counts a [[cease and desist]] notice,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claytoncounts.com/neato/ceaseanddesist.jpg Cease and Desist email sent to Counts]&lt;/ref&gt; demanded the [[IP address]]es of everyone who downloaded it through his blog, and attempted to sue him for upwards of $30 mil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080406124634/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2006/09/12/the-musics-over-for-pet-soundssgt-peppers-mash-up/ Rolling Stone: The Music’s Over For Pet Sounds/Sgt. Peppers Mash-Up]&lt;/ref&gt; However, upon deletion of the album, the case was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/update-beachles-interview-clayton-counts Tiny Mix Tapes: Update on The Beachles: An Interview with Clayton Counts]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December, Counts' site announced his death, which was later revealed to be a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arvofingers.blogspot.com.au/2008/01/in-memory-of-clayton-counts.html The Sarcophagus of Talk: In Memory of Clayton Counts]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Counts along with Neil Keener founded the band [[Bull of Heaven (band)|Bull of Heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140223204622/http://mamacolive.com/thefly/blog/6717/Long-Players/ The Fly: Long Players]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.westword.com/backbeat/2011/02/bull_of_heaven_works_to_provid.php Westword: Bull of Heaven works to provide enough music for several lifetimes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://music.newcity.com/2012/04/04/escape-from-noise-is-this-not-music/ Newcity Music: Escape From Noise - Is This Not Music?]&lt;/ref&gt; Their first piece, ''001: Weed Problem'', was released on January 30, 2008. Since then, the band has released more than 300 numbered pieces, a second set of 100 pieces numbered in [[Roman numerals]], many pieces of notable length, as well as a variety of untitled tracks, sound puzzles, and anti-music. On 21 January 2009, Counts was featured as the cover of the [[Denver Post]]'s arts section, performing a solo piano composition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/clayton-counts-of-denver-a-contemporary-classical-composer-news-photo/161068142 Denver Post/Getty Images press photo of Clayton Counts]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the band's site suffered some downtime, and has been going through various issues since. In July, they announced that a "Series 2" of music would be coming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151090908821215 Bull of Heaven Facebook: Series 2]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the band announced that new material was nearing completion, and have since added new pieces to their [[Facebook]] page and [[Internet Archive]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/BullOfHeaven/ Bull of Heaven collection at Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the band are still releasing music regularly with Counts giving an interview in February to [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] in the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[http://noisey.vice.com/nl/blog/bull-of-heaven-maakt-nummers-die-jren-duren/| Vice Noisey: Bull Of Heaven maakt nummers die jááááááren duren|]&lt;/ref&gt; and the band performing at the [[Lemp Neighborhood Arts Center]] in St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stljazznotes.blogspot.com/2014/07/bull-of-heaven-performing-at-lnac-this.html|title=St. Louis Jazz Notes: Bull of Heaven performing at LNAC this Saturday, August 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.allaboutjazz.com/jazz-this-week-st-louis-cabaret-festival-bull-of-heaven-all-that-tap-xxiii-and-more.php|title=Jazz This Week: St. Louis Cabaret Festival, Bull of Heaven, "All That Tap Xxiii," and More]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[artificial immune systems]], '''clonal selection algorithms''' are a class of algorithms inspired by the [[clonal selection]] theory of [[acquired immunity]] that explains how B and T [[lymphocyte]]s improve their response to [[antigens]] over time called [[affinity maturation]]. These algorithms focus on the [[Universal Darwinism|Darwinian]] attributes of the theory where selection is inspired by the affinity of [[antigen-antibody interaction|antigen-antibody interactions]], reproduction is inspired by [[cell division]], and variation is inspired by [[somatic hypermutation]]. Clonal selection algorithms are most commonly applied to [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[pattern recognition]] domains, some of which resemble parallel [[hill climbing]] and the [[genetic algorithm]] without the recombination operator&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cleveralgorithms.com/nature-inspired/immune/clonal_selection_algorithm.html|title=Clonal Selection Algorithm|last=Brownlee|first=Jason|date=|website=Clonal Selection Algorithm|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence''' was the name of a 1956 summer workshop now considered by many&lt;ref&gt;Solomonoff, R.J.The Time Scale of Artificial Intelligence; Reflections on Social Effects, Human Systems Management, Vol 5 1985, Pp 149-153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moor, J., The Dartmouth College Artificial Intelligence Conference: The Next Fifty years, AI Magazine, Vol 27, No., 4, Pp. 87-9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (though not all&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Ronald R., Cybernetics, Automata Studies and the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, October–December, 2011, IEEE Computer Society&lt;/ref&gt;) to be the [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] event for [[artificial intelligence]] as a field.

The project lasted approximately six to eight weeks, and was essentially an extended [[brainstorming]] session. Eleven mathematicians and scientists were originally planned to be attendees, and while not all attended, more than ten others came for short times.

== Background ==

In the early 1950s, there were various names for the field of "thinking machines" such as cybernetics, automata theory, and complex information processing.&lt;ref&gt;McCorduck, P., Machines Who Think, A.K. Peters, Ltd, Second Edition, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; These indicate how different the ideas were on what such machines would be like.

In 1955 [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], then a young Assistant Professor of Mathematics at [[Dartmouth College]], decided to organize a group to clarify and develop ideas about thinking machines. He picked the name 'Artificial Intelligence' for the new field. He chose the name partly for its neutrality; avoiding a focus on narrow automata theory, and avoiding cybernetics which was heavily focused on analog feedback, as well as him potentially having to accept the assertive [[Norbert Wiener]] as guru or having to argue with him.&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, N., The Quest for Artificial Intelligence, Cambridge University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1955, McCarthy approached the Rockefeller Foundation to request funding for a summer seminar at Dartmouth for about 10 participants. In June, he and [[Claude Shannon]], a founder of Information Theory then at Bell Labs, met with Robert Morison, Director of Biological and Medical Research to discuss the idea and possible funding, though Morison, was unsure whether money would be made available for such a visionary project.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Ronald R., Cybernetics, Automata Studies and the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, October–December, 2011, IEEE Computer Society, (citing letters, from Rockefeller Foundation Archives, Dartmouth file6, 17, 1955 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 1955, the project was formally proposed by McCarthy, [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Nathaniel Rochester (computer scientist)|Nathaniel Rochester]] and [[Claude Shannon]]. The proposal is credited with introducing the term 'artificial intelligence'.

The Proposal states&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, J., Minsky, M., Rochester, N., Shannon, C.E., A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence., http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxa/dart564props.pdf August, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|We propose that a 2-month, 10-man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]]. The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.}}
The proposal goes on to discuss [[computers]], [[natural language processing]], [[neural networks]], [[theory of computation]], [[abstraction]] and [[creativity]] (these areas within the field of artificial intelligence are considered still relevant to the work of the field).

On May 26, 1956, McCarthy notified Robert Morison of the planned 11 attendees:

For the full period:
: 1) [[Marvin Minsky|Dr. Marvin Minsky]] 
: 2) [[Julian Bigelow|Dr. Julian Bigelow]]
: 3) [[Donald MacCrimmon MacKay|Professor D.M. Mackay]]
: 4) [[Ray Solomonoff|Mr. Ray Solomonoff]]
: 5) [[John Henry Holland|Mr. John Holland]]
: 6) [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|Mr. John McCarthy]].

For four weeks:
: 7) [[Claude Shannon|Dr. Claude Shannon]]
: 8) [[Nathaniel Rochester (computer scientist)|Mr. Nathanial Rochester]]
: 9) [[Oliver Selfridge|Mr. Oliver Selfridge]]

For the first two weeks:
: 10) [[Allen Newell|Mr. Allen Newell]]
: 11) [[Herbert A. Simon|Professor Herbert Simon]].

He noted, "we will concentrate on a problem of devising a way of programming a calculator to form concepts and to form generalizations. This of course is subject to change when the group gets together."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Ronald R., Cybernetics, Automata Studies and the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, October–December, 2011, IEEE Computer Society&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Stottler Henke Associates]], besides the proposal's authors, attendees at the conference included [[Ray Solomonoff]], [[Oliver Selfridge]], [[Trenchard More]], [[Arthur Samuel]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], and [[Allen Newell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stottlerhenke.com/ai_general/history.htm Stottler-Henke] retrieved 18:19 (UTC), 27th of July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~vox/0607/0724/ai50.html Artificial Intelligence: Past, Present, and Future (Vox of Dartmouth)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~ai50/homepage.html The Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence Conference: The Next Fifty Years]&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual participants came at different times, mostly for much shorter times. Trenchard More replaced Rochester for three weeks and MacKay and Holland did not attend --- but the project was set to begin. 
 
Around June 18, 1956, the earliest participants (perhaps only Ray Solomonoff, maybe with Tom Etter) arrived at the Dartmouth campus in Hanover, N.H., to join John McCarthy who already had an apartment there. Ray and Marvin stayed at Professors' apartments, but most would stay at the Hanover Inn.

The Dartmouth Workshop is said to have run for six weeks in the summer of 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, N., The Quest for Artificial Intelligence, Cambridge University Press, 2010, P. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Ray Solomonoff's notes written during the Workshop, however, say it ran for roughly eight weeks, from about June 18 to August 17.&lt;ref&gt;

Solomonoff's Dartmouth notes start on June 22; June 28 mentions Minsky, June 30 mentions Hanover, N.H., July 1 mentions Tom Etter. On August 17, Ray gave a final talk.&lt;ref&gt;Papers at http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxbdart/boxbdart.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Participants ==

Initially, McCarthy lost his list of attendees. Instead, after the workshop, McCarthy sent Ray a preliminary list of participants and visitors plus those interested in the subject. There were 47 people listed.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, J., List, Sept., 1956; List among Solomonoff papers to be posted on website solomonof.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomonoff, however, made a complete list in his notes of the summer project:&lt;ref&gt;http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxbdart/dart56ray812825who.pdf 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Ray Solomonoff]]

# [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]]
# [[Claude Shannon]]
# [[Trenchard More]]
# [[Nathaniel Rochester (computer scientist)|Nat Rochester]]
# [[Oliver Selfridge]]

Shannon attended Ray's talk on July 10 and Bigelow gave a talk on August 15. Ray doesn't mention Bernard Widrow, but apparently he visited, along with W.A. Clark and B.G. Farley.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Ronald R., Cybernetics, Automata Studies and the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, October–December, 2011, IEEE Computer Society&lt;/ref&gt; Trenchard mentions R. Culver and Ray mentions Bill Shutz. Herb Gelernter didn't attend, but was influenced later by what Rochester learned.&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, N., The Quest for Artificial Intelligence, Cambridge University Press, 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; Gloria Minsky also commuted there (with their part-beagle dog, Senje, who would start out in the car back seat and end up curled around her like a scarf), and attended some sessions (without Senje).&lt;ref&gt;personal communication&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray Solomonoff, Marvin Minsky, and John McCarthy were the only three who stayed for the full-time.  Trenchard took attendance during two weeks of his three-week visit. From three to about eight people would attend the daily sessions.&lt;ref&gt;More, Trenchard, 1956, http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxa/dart56more5th6thweeks.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Event and aftermath ==

They had the entire top floor of the Dartmouth Math Department to themselves, and most weekdays they would meet at the main math classroom where someone might lead a discussion focusing on his/her ideas, or more frequently, a general discussion would be held.

It was not a directed group research project, discussions covered many topics but several directions are considered to have been initiated or encouraged by the Workshop: the rise of symbolic methods,  systems focussed on limited domains (early Expert Systems), and deductive systems versus inductive systems. One participant, Arthur Samuel said, "It was very interesting, very stimulating, very exciting".&lt;ref&gt;McCorduck, P., Machines Who Think, A.K. Peters, Ltd, Second Edition, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray Solomonoff kept notes giving his impression of the talks and the ideas from various discussions.&lt;ref&gt;http://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deep Space Transport''' ('''DST'''), also called '''Mars Transit Vehicle''',&lt;ref name='Free 2017/&gt; is a crewed interplanetary [[spacecraft]] concept by [[NASA]] to support science exploration missions to [[Mars]] of up to 1,000 days.&lt;ref name="ARS Tech DST"&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/03/for-the-first-time-nasa-has-begun-detailing-its-deep-space-exploration-plans/ Finally, some details about how NASA actually plans to get to Mars].

== Architecture overview ==

Both the Gateway and the DST would be fitted with the [[International Docking System Standard]].&lt;ref name="Inverse 2017"/&gt; The DST spacecraft would comprise two elements: an [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion capsule]] and a habitation module&lt;ref name="Rucker 2018"/&gt; that would be propelled by both [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] and chemical propulsion, and carry a crew of four in a medium-sized habitat.&lt;ref name="ARS Tech DST"/&gt; The fully assembled spacecraft with the Orion capsule mated, would have a mass of about 100 metric tones.&lt;ref name="Inverse 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2017 architecture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rucker 2018"/&gt;&lt;!--slide #11 refers to a landing cargo mission with 100-200 tons--&gt; The spacecraft's habitat portion will likely be fabricated using tooling and structures developed for the [[Space Launch System|SLS]] propellant tank;&lt;ref name="Smitherman 2018"&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20180002054.pdf |title=Research Possibilities Beyond Deep Space Gateway |conference=Deep Space Gateway Concept Science Workshop.

The habitat portion of the DST spacecraft may also be equipped with a laboratory with research instrumentation for physical sciences, [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]], chemical analyses, freezers, medical research, small live animal quarters, plant growth chambers, and [[3-D printing]].&lt;ref name="Smitherman 2018"/&gt; External payloads might include cameras, telescopes, detectors, and a robotic arm.&lt;ref name="Smitherman 2018"/&gt;

When performing a lunar [[Planetary flyby|flyby]] for increased velocity, the initial target for exploration is Mars (flyby or orbit), and other suggested destinations are Venus (flyby or orbit), and a sample return from a large [[asteroid]].&lt;ref name="MacDonald 2017"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://spacearchitect.org/pubs/AIAA-2017-5100.pdf |title=Towards an Interplanetary Spaceship: The Potential Role of Long-Duration Deep Space Habitation and Transportation in the Evolution and Organization of Human Spaceflight and Space Exploration |conference=AIAA SPACE and Astronautics Forum and Exposition.

'''''Delicacy''''' ({{lang-fr|'''La Délicatesse'''}}) is a 2011 French [[romantic comedy|romantic comedy-drama]] directed by [[David Foenkinos|David]] and [[Stéphane Foenkinos]] based on a novel of the same name by David Foenkinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academie-cinema.org/ceremonie/palmares.html |title=Palmarès des César - Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma |website=Academie-cinema.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Nathalie, a young attractive woman is in love with a young attractive man, François. He proposes and they marry (portrayed in something resembling a ‘dream’ sequence), honeymoon, and are immediately pressured by family to have children. Nathalie takes a new job, hired partially because her new boss is sexually interested in her. One day, François goes out to jog and is killed in a traffic accident. Nathalie is devastated.

After wallowing in pity from the tragedy for several days, she collects most of François' stuff (reminders of him) in their apartment and tosses it into the garbage. Her friends and family are very concerned about her. She eventually returns to work, exciting her (married) boss as to her new ‘availability’. Time passes. On the job for three years and focusing solely on her work, she has gone without any other romantic relationship. One evening her boss takes her to dinner to celebrate getting a big contract and he hits on her. She is not attracted to him, and tells him so, but that they can still respect each other and work together.

One day at work, Markus, a subordinate on her work-team (unseen until now) enters her office to discuss a case, and she, in a trance-like state, just walks up to him and passionately kisses him. He is pleasantly stunned, and later leaves work confident and happy, passing several beautiful women in the street as they (in his mind) ‘ogle’ him. That night, he thinks about what happened and tries to imagine what Nathalie is doing.

His confusion about this incident is because he is a native Swede (who has worked in France the past 15 years, with his parents living nearby), balding, an average looking guy, maybe 40 years old, and cannot possibly imagine why someone like Nathalie would be interested in someone like him.

The next day at work he asks Nathalie why she kissed him, and she seems to not remember. She tells him she must have been ‘elsewhere’ and to forget it. He tells her he cannot. She says her behavior was inappropriate and that she was daydreaming, and he leaves her office. She tells her friend about the exchange. The first thing her friend asks her is "Is he hot?"

The next day at 5 pm at work Markus goes to see Nathalie and kisses her; she is surprised, but then enjoys kissing him, as they embrace. He leaves, and she goes to find him. They talk and agree to go to dinner. They seem to connect well. Markus still cannot believe this is happening.

They go to a play together a few nights later.  As he walks her home, he realizes he is falling in love, and tells her that, and that it’s "ridiculous" and he doesn't want to get hurt, then runs away, leaving Nathalie puzzled.

The next day at work Markus purposely ignores her, to her annoyance. Nathalie lets slip to her assistant that they went to see that play, and office gossip about them being a ‘couple’ soon spreads. Nathalie goes to find Markus and tells him she enjoyed being together, but he still ignores her. Later that day, at an office birthday party for the assistant, Nathalie confronts Markus about his attitude in front of everyone, leading to further gossip. They reconcile, and he gives her a particularly sentimental gift. Later, Nathalie goes home to her father and cries.

Nathalie and Markus go on another date, where a guy openly hits on Nathalie, not believing she would be with a guy like Markus, and Markus and he fight. The next day at work, her boss asks about her new relationship, hinting at his disapproval, and infuriating her. The boss then calls Markus into his office to talk to him; they later have dinner, so the boss can figure out what Nathalie sees in Markus, discovering he is just a nice guy and a ‘poetic’ thinker. Markus puts the drunken boss into a cab, then goes to meet up with Nathalie at her friend's home, where there is a small party occurring. Nathalie is happy to see him and to introduce him to her 'crowd', but they, all ‘attractive people’, cannot see what she sees in him, either. Markus is very uncomfortable at this, and Nathalie senses that, so they leave and go home to her place, where they just fall asleep in separate chairs, holding hands.  At breakfast they talk about the "relationship" they are not having, which everyone else thinks they are in, and her annoying boss.

At work she confronts her boss about his meeting with Markus. Her boss calls Markus an "ugly, insignificant guy", and she tells him off. After further insulting words are put forth, including a comment about her ‘unfaithfulness’ to her deceased husband, Nathalie walks out, ignoring a major project meeting. She drives to the countryside where she grew up and where François was from too, even though they did not know each other then. Nathalie phones and then picks up Markus in a small town, and takes him to the cemetery where François is buried, but it is locked. Then, in the pouring rain, she takes him to her grandmother's home, where they are both warmly welcomed, and her grandmother is impressed by Markus, as she tells Nathalie, "He is a good man."

That night, after a simple soup dinner, they consummate their relationship. The next morning in the garden, as Markus plays hide-and-seek with Nathalie, he imagines her in various phases of her life in that garden, and hides amongst the many ‘hers’. Nathalie, counting, looks contented, enigmatically and wryly smiling into the camera.

'''Elephant shrews''', also called '''jumping shrews''' or '''sengis''', are small [[insectivore|insectivorous]] [[mammal]]s native to [[Africa]], belonging to the family '''Macroscelididae''', in the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Macroscelidea.''' Their traditional common English name "elephant shrew" comes from a fancied resemblance between their long noses and the trunk of an [[elephant]], and their superficial similarity with [[shrew]]s (family Soricidae) in the order [[Eulipotyphla]]. However, [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analysis revealed that elephant shrews are not classified with true shrews, but are in fact more closely related to elephants than shrews. In 1997 the biologist [[Jonathan Kingdon]] proposed that they instead be called "sengis" (singular ''sengi''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kingdon|first=J.|year=1997|title=The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-691-11692-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term derived from the [[Bantu languages]] of Africa, and in 1998 they were classified into the new clade [[Afrotheria]].&lt;ref name="Stanhope"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanhope|first=M. J.|author2=Waddell, V. G.|author3=Madsen, O.|author4=de Jong, W.|author5=Hedges, S. B.|author6=Cleven, G. C.|author7=Kao, D.|author8=Springer, M. S.|year=1998|title=Molecular evidence for multiple origins of Insectivora and for a new order of endemic African insectivore mammals|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=95|issue=17|pages=9967–9972|bibcode=1998PNAS...95.9967S|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.17.9967|pmc=21445|pmid=9707584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are widely distributed across the southern part of Africa, and although common nowhere, can be found in almost any type of habitat, from the [[Namib Desert]] to boulder-strewn outcrops in South Africa to thick forest. One species, the [[North African elephant shrew]], remains in the semiarid, mountainous country in the far northwest of the continent.

The creature is one of the fastest small mammals, having been recorded to reach speeds of {{convert|28.8|kph|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/25729116 ''Nature'' (BBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Elephant shrews are small, quadrupedal, insectivorous mammals resembling rodents or opossums, with scaly tails, elongated snouts, and rather long legs for their size, which are used to move in a hopping fashion like rabbits. They vary in size from about {{convert|10|to|30|cm|in}}, from {{convert|50|to|500|g}}. The [[short-eared elephant shrew]] has an average size of {{Convert|150|mm|abbr=on}}. Although the size of the trunk varies among species, all are able to twist it about in search of food. Their lifespans are about two and a half to four years in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Animals|publisher=EBSCO Publishing|location=Online database}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2010}} They have large canine teeth, and also high-crowned [[Molar (tooth)|cheek teeth]] similar to those of [[ungulate]]s.&lt;ref name=EoM&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Macdonald, D.|author=[[Galen Rathbun|Rathbun, Galen]] B.|year=1984|title=The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|pages=730–733|isbn=0-87196-871-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[dentition|dental formula]] is {{DentalFormula|upper=1-3.1.4.2|lower=3.1.4.2-3}}

Although mostly diurnal&lt;ref&gt;Conniff, Richard. ''Shrewd Configuration'', [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]], June 2005. pp. 26-28.&lt;/ref&gt; and very active, they are difficult to trap and very seldom seen; elephant shrews are wary, well camouflaged, and adept at dashing away from threats. Several species make a series of cleared pathways through the undergrowth and spend their day patrolling them for insect life. If the animal is disturbed, the pathway provides an obstacle-free escape route.

Elephant shrews are not highly social animals, but many live in monogamous pairs, which share and defend their home territory, marked using [[scent gland]]s.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; ''[[Rhynchocyon]]'' species also dig small conical holes in the soil, [[bandicoot]]-style, but others may make use of natural crevices, or make leaf nests.

Short-eared elephant shrews inhabit the dry steppes and stone deserts of southwestern Africa. They can even be found in the [[Namib Desert]], one of the driest regions of the earth. Females drive away other females, while males try to ward off other males. Although they live in pairs, the partners do not care much for each other and their sole purpose of even associating with the opposite sex is for reproduction. Social behaviors are not very common and they even have separate nests. The one or two young are well developed at birth; they are able to run within a few hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Short-eared elephant-shrew (Macroscelides proboscideus) - A "living fossil" from the Namib-desert|url=http://magazine.naturspot.de/text/elephant-shrew.html|publisher=Natur Spot|accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:An elephant shrew with a small proboscis. Etching. Wellcome V0020893.jpg|alt=Etching of an elephant shrew with a small proboscis. |left|thumb|Etching of an elephant shrew with a small proboscis]]

Female elephant shrews undergo a [[menstrual cycle]] similar to that of human females and the species is one of the few nonprimate mammals to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Horst|first=Cornelius|last2=Gillman|first2=Joseph|year=1941|title=The menstrual cycle in Elephantulus|url=|journal=The South African Journal of Medical Sciences|volume=6|pages=27–47|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elephant shrew mating period lasts for several days. After mating, the pair will return to their solitary habits. After a [[gestation]] period varying from 45 to 60 days, the female will bear litters of one to three young several times a year. The young are born relatively well developed, but remain in the nest for several days before venturing outside.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt;

After five days, the young's milk diet is supplemented with mashed insects, which are collected and transported in the cheek pouches of the female. The young then slowly start to explore their environment and hunt for insects. After about 15 days, the young will begin the migratory phase of their lives, which lessens their dependency on their mother. The young will then establish their own home ranges (about {{convert|1|sqkm|abbr=on}}) and will become sexually active within 41–46 days.&lt;ref name="Rathbun-1992"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rathbun|first=Galen B.|date=September 1992|title=The Fairly True Elephant-Shrew|journal=Natural History|location=New York|volume=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://members.aon.at/ruesselspringer/indexe.html|title=Short-eared Elephant-Shrews|first=Regina|last=Unger|accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feeding habits==
Elephant shrews mainly eat [[insects]], [[spiders]], [[centipedes]], [[millipedes]], and [[earthworms]]. An elephant shrew uses its nose to find prey and uses its tongue to flick small food into its mouth, much like an [[anteater]]. Eating large prey can pose a challenge; an elephant shrew struggling with an earthworm must first pin its prey to the ground with a forefoot. Then, turning its head to one side, it chews pieces off with its cheek teeth, much like a dog chewing a bone. This is a sloppy process, and many small pieces of worm drop to the ground; these are simply flicked up with the tongue. Some elephant shrews also feed on small amounts of plant matter, especially new leaves, seeds, and small fruits.&lt;ref name="Rathbun-1992"/&gt;

==Evolution==
A number of fossil species are known, all from Africa. They were separate from the similar-appearing order [[Leptictida]]. A considerable diversification of macroscelids occurred in the [[Paleogene]] Era. Some, such as ''[[Myohyrax]]'', were so similar to [[hyrax]]es that they were initially included with that group, while others, such as ''[[Mylomygale]]'', were relatively [[rodent]]-like. These unusual forms all died out by the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Savage, RJG|author2= Long, MR|last-author-amp=yes|year=1986|title=Mammal Evolution: an illustrated guide|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|page=54|isbn=0-8160-1194-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although macroscelids have been classified with many groups, often on the basis of superficial characteristics, considerable morphological and molecular evidence now indicates placing them within [[Afrotheria]], probably close to the base of [[Paenungulata]].

==Classification==
In the past, elephant shrews have been classified with the shrews and [[hedgehog]]s as part of the [[Insectivora]]; regarded as distant relatives of the [[ungulate]]s; grouped with the [[treeshrew]]s; and lumped in with the hares and rabbits in the [[Lagomorpha]]. Recent molecular evidence, however, strongly supports a superorder [[Afrotheria]] that unites elephant shrews with [[tenrec]]s and [[golden mole]]s as well as certain mammals previously presumed to be ungulates, including [[hyrax]]es, [[sirenian]]s, [[aardvark]]s and [[elephant]]s.

A '''flying polyp''' is a fictional, [[polyp]]-like [[extraterrestrial life]]form created by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] for the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. Lovecraft introduced the creatures in his 1936 [[novella]] ''[[The Shadow Out of Time|The Shadow out of Time]]''. "Flying polyp" is a term of convenience, since Lovecraft never published a name for the creatures.

==Description==
{{Quote|[The flying polyps were a] horrible elder race of half polypous, utterly alien entities... They were only partly material and had the power of aerial motion, despite the absence of wings... [They exhibited] a monstrous plasticity and ... temporary lapses of visibility... Singular whistling noises and colossal footprints made up of five circular toe marks seemed also to be associated with them.|H. P. Lovecraft|"The Shadow Out of Time"}}

The flying polyps came to Earth from space as conquerors about seven hundred fifty million years ago. They also inhabited three other planets in the [[solar system]],&lt;ref&gt;[[S. T. Joshi]] suggests that one of the mysterious solar planets inhabited by the polyps might have been [[Yuggoth]] ([[Pluto]]) because its windowless buildings "would be admirably suited to these sightless denizens!" (Joshi, "Lovecraft's Other Planets", p. 36, ''Selected Papers on Lovecraft''.)&lt;/ref&gt; including possibly [[Cthulhu Mythos celestial bodies#Yaksh|Yaksh]] ([[Neptune]]) and [[Cthulhu Mythos celestial bodies#Tond|Tond]] (though Tond itself may lie outside the solar system, or may be possibly referring to Pluto, which was discovered only 6 years before the publication of the story). On Earth, they built [[basalt]] cities with high windowless towers. When they attempted to colonize the oceans, the polyps were driven back by the [[Elder Things]]. Thereafter, they restricted their habitats to the surface world. 
 
Their senses did not include sight, but what senses they had could penetrate all material obstructions. They were only partially matter, but still solid enough to affect and be stopped by normal materials; this additionally gave them resistance, if not outright invulnerability, to normal means of damage, though they could be destroyed by certain forms of electrical energy. Their minds were so strange that the [[Great Race of Yith]] could not perform psychic transfers with them.

They are able to levitate and fly despite lacking any visible means of doing so, and leave telltale massive footprints when on the ground. Their amorphous bodies can turn [[Invisibility|invisible]] at will, though this ability appears somewhat negated by whistling noises associated with them in general. In battle, their ability to control and direct powerful [[wind]]s is put to use as a weapon.

When the Great Race of Yith came to Earth, they warred with the polyps and soon drove them underground with their advanced technology. The Great Race then sealed the entryways to the polyps' subterranean abode with trapdoors, which afterwards were diligently guarded. The polyps' cities were left abandoned, perhaps as a reminder of the horrors that dwelt below.

Eventually, the polyps rose up and almost exterminated the Great Race, afterwards returning to their subterranean haunts. Having no conception of light, the polyps seem content to remain there, annihilating the few intruders that chance upon them. The entrances to their dwellings are mostly deep within ancient ruins where there are great wells sealed over with stone. Inside these wells still dwell the polyps.

==Other appearances==
* [[The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets]] released a song titled "Ride the Flying Polyp" on their 2007 album "The Shadow Out of Tim".

'''Frank Rudolph Olson''' (July 17, 1910 – November 28, 1953) was an American [[bacteriologist]], [[biological warfare]] scientist, and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) employee who worked at [[Fort Detrick|Camp Detrick (now Fort Detrick)]] in Maryland. At a meeting in rural Maryland, he was covertly dosed with [[LSD]] by his CIA supervisor and, nine days later, plunged to his death from the window of a 13th-story New York City hotel room. The U.S. government first described his death as a suicide, and then as misadventure, while others allege murder.&lt;ref name=NYTimesMag-2001-04-01&gt;{{cite news|title=What did the C.I.A. do to Eric Olson's father?|date=April 1, 2001|author=[[Michael Ignatieff|Ignatieff, Michael]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/01/magazine/01OLSON.html|work=The New York Times Magazine|accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission report]] on the CIA in 1975 acknowledged their having conducted drug studies.

==Biography==
Olson was born in [[Hurley, Wisconsin|Hurley]], [[Iron County, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr. Frank R. Olson Dies in New York City |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22421355/frank_olson_19101953/|newspaper=Iron County Miner|date=December 4, 1953|page=1|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = August 2, 2018 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned both B.S. and Ph.D. degrees ([[Bacteriology]], 1938) at the [[University of Wisconsin]]. He married and had three children: Eric, Nils, and Lisa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Statement on the Murder of Frank Olson|url=http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Statements/FamilyStatement2002.html|website=frankolsonproject|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olson worked for a time at [[Purdue University]] in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]], and then served as a [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] in the [[U.S. Army Chemical Corps]].

As a civilian, he was recruited to Camp Detrick, and to the [[U.S. Army Biological Warfare Laboratories]], by the distinguished UW scientist [[Ira Baldwin]], the technical director there. (Baldwin had been his departmental advisor at UW.) At Camp Detrick, Baldwin worked with industrial partners such as [[George W. Merck]] and the U.S. military to establish the top secret [[U.S. bioweapons program]] beginning in 1943, during World War II, a time when interest in applying modern technology to warfare was high. Olson's duties included experiments with aerosolized [[Bacillus anthracis|anthrax]].&lt;ref name="Ignatieff, Op. cit."&gt;Ignatieff, ''Op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; There were [[Allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War|allegations that the US used biological warfare during the Korean War]] but the government denied this. After 10 years, Olson was a senior bacteriologist at the program.&lt;ref name=unwitting/&gt;

At some point while assigned as a civilian U.S. Army contractor, Olson began working as a CIA employee with the CIA's [[Technical Services Staff]] (TSS), run by [[Sidney Gottlieb]] and his deputy Robert Lashbrook.&lt;ref name="Ignatieff, Op. cit."/&gt; Some of his CIA colleagues were involved in the [[MKNAOMI]]-[[MKULTRA]] program, previously known as [[Project Artichoke]] and, earlier, Project Bluebird. It was a program to explore the possible espionage and military uses of [[psychotropic drugs]].

The author [[Ed Regis (author)|Ed Regis]] reports that the meeting at which Olson was dosed with LSD took place at [[Deep Creek Lake]], Maryland:

{{blockquote|Deep Creek Lake was three hours by car from Camp Detrick. On Wednesday morning, November 18, 1953, about a week before Thanksgiving, a group from the SO Division, including Vincent Ruwet, chief of the division, John Schwab, Frank Olson, Ben Wilson, Gerald Yonetz, and John Malinowski, drove out to the retreat... The Detrick group was met at the lodge by Sid Gottlieb, his deputy Robert Lashbrook, and a couple of others from the CIA....On the second day of the retreat, after dinner, Gottlieb spiked a bottle of [[Cointreau]] with a small quantity of a substance that he and his TSS colleagues privately referred to as "serunin" but which was in fact [[lysergic acid diethylamide]], or LSD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ed Regis (author)|Regis, Ed]] (1999), ''The Biology of Doom: America's Secret Germ Warfare Project''; New York: Henry Holt &amp; Company, pg 153.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Olson asked to quit the biowarfare program the week after the retreat:

{{blockquote|Ruwet was surprised to see Olson at 7:30 in the morning, but asked him in. Olson told Ruwet that he was dissatisfied with his own performance at the retreat, that he was experiencing considerable self-doubts, and that in fact he had decided he would like to be out of the germ warfare business. He wanted to leave Camp Detrick and devote his life to something else.&lt;ref&gt;Regis, ''[[Op. cit.]]'', pg 157.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Olson subsequently suffered severe paranoia and a [[nervous breakdown]]. The CIA sent him to New York City to see one of their physicians, who recommended that Olson be placed into a mental institution for recovery. This was [[Harold Abramson]], an allergist-pediatrician, who was helping the CIA with the psychotropic research into the effects of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;Regis, ''Op. cit.'', pg 158.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hotel Pennsylvania, NY (external view, ca 1919).jpg|thumb|120px|right|The [[Hotel Pennsylvania]], NYC (called the Hotel Statler in 1953).]]
The ensuing police report said that on his last night in [[Manhattan]], Olson purposely [[Defenestration#Self-defenestration (jumping out of a window)|threw himself out of]] the window of his tenth-floor hotel room at the [[Hotel Pennsylvania|Hotel Statler]], which he had been sharing with Lashbrook, and died shortly after impact.&lt;ref name=unwitting&gt;{{cite news  | author=[[Seymour Hersh]] | title=Family Plans to Sue C.I.A.

==Murder and wrongful death allegations==

===1975===
Although Olson's family told friends that Olson had suffered "a fatal nervous breakdown" which resulted in the fall,&lt;ref name="Ignatieff, Op. cit."/&gt; the family had no knowledge of the specific details surrounding the tragedy until the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]] uncovered some of the CIA's [[Project MKULTRA|MKULTRA]] activities in 1975. That year, the government admitted that Olson had been dosed with LSD, without his knowledge, nine days before his death. After the family announced they planned to sue the Agency over Olson's "wrongful death," the government offered them an out-of-court settlement of $1,250,000, later reduced to $750,000, which they accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Coen and Eric Nadler, ''Dead Silence: Fear and Terror on the Anthrax Trail'' (Counterpoint Press, 2009) p97&lt;/ref&gt; The family received apologies from President Gerald Ford and then-CIA director William Colby.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-frank-olson-lawsuit-20121208-story.html|title=Six decades later, sons seek answers on death of Detrick scientist|last=Brown|first=Matthew Hay|date=December 8, 2012|work=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=September 24, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1994–1996===
In 1994, Eric Olson had his father's body exhumed to be buried with his mother. The family decided to have a second autopsy performed. The 1953 medical report done immediately after Dr. Olson's death indicated that there were cuts and abrasions on the body.&lt;ref&gt;http://frankolsonproject.org/staging01/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/William_Colby-1975-documents.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Theories sparked about Olson having been assassinated by the CIA. When the second autopsy was performed by James Starrs, Professor of Law and Forensic Science at the [[George Washington University National Law Center]], his team searched the body for any cuts and abrasions and found none. Starrs found a large hematoma on the left side of Olson's head and a large injury on his chest. Most of the team concluded that the blunt-force trauma to the head and the injury to the chest had not occurred during the fall, but most likely in the room before the fall (one team member dissented&lt;ref name="Ignatieff, Op. cit."/&gt;). Starrs called the evidence "rankly and starkly suggestive of [[homicide]]."&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

In 1996, Eric approached the [[U.S. District Attorney]] in Manhattan, [[Robert Morgenthau]], to see if his office would open a new investigation. Stephen Saracco and Daniel Bibb of the office's "cold case" unit collected preliminary information, including a [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] of Lashbrook, but concluded that there was no compelling case to send to a grand jury.&lt;ref name="Ignatieff, Op. cit." /&gt; In 2001, Canadian historian and former politician [[Michael Ignatieff]] wrote an account of Eric's decades-long campaign to clear his father's name for ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ignatieff, ''Op. cit''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20090924123614/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/01/magazine/cia-what-did-the-cia-do-to-his-father.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020205013544/http://frankolsonproject.org/Articles/GQ.html|title="The Man Who Knew Too Much" (GQ, Jan 2000)|author=|date=5 February 2002|website=archive.org|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ignatieff.

Eric Olson said the forensic evidence of death is suggestive of a method used by the CIA found in the first manual of assassination that says "The most efficient accident, in simple assassination, is a fall of 75 feet or more onto a hard surface."&lt;ref name="villagevoice.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/12/12/errol-morriss-wormwood-descends-into-time-killing-conspiracy-fanfic/|title=Errol Morris’s "Wormwood" Descends Into Time-Killing Conspiracy Fanfic|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012–2013===
On November 28, 2012, sons Eric and Nils Olson filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|US District Court in Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;The case was ''Olson v. U.S.'', 12-cv-01924, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).&lt;/ref&gt; seeking unspecified compensatory damages as well as access to documents related to their father's death and other matters that they claimed the CIA had withheld from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Sues US Over Scientist's Mysterious Death|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/family-sues-cia-over-scientists-mysterious-death|publisher=AP|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian1&gt;{{cite news|title=CIA sued over 1950s 'murder' of government scientist plied with LSD|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/29/cia-lawsuit-scientist-1950s-death|publisher=The Guardian (UK)|accessdate=12 January 2013|location=London|first=Karen|last=McVeigh|date=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed in July 2013, due in part to the 1976 settlement between the family and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gaines|first=Danielle|title=Lawsuit by family of drugged Detrick employee dismissed|url=http://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/crime_and_justice/article_8705f623-edfd-59b0-9e04-548b15a2c423.html?TNNoMobile|accessdate=20 October 2013|newspaper=Frederick News-Post|date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decision dismissing the suit, [[U.S. District Judge]] [[James Boasberg]] wrote, "While the court must limit its analysis to the four corners of the complaint, the skeptical reader may wish to know that the public record supports many of the allegations [in the family's suit], farfetched as they may sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schoenberg|first=Tom|title=CIA Cover-Up Suit Over Scientist's Fatal Fall Dismissed |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-17/cia-cover-up-suit-over-scientist-s-fatal-fall-dismissed.html|accessdate=22 February 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg News|date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017-2018 ===
[[Netflix]] released a documentary miniseries, entitled ''[[Wormwood (miniseries)|Wormwood]]'' (2017), based on the mystery of Olson's death; it was directed by [[Errol Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/movies/wormwood-review-errol-morris-peter-sarsgaard.html |title=Review: ‘Wormwood’ Confirms That Errol Morris Is Our Great Cinematic Sleuth |last=Scott |first=A.O. |authorlink=A. O. Scott |date=2017-12-14 |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the miniseries, journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] says the government had a security process to identify and execute domestic dissidents (perceived to pose a risk). He said that Frank Olson was a victim of this and an ongoing cover-up after his death. If this is correct, then the U.S. government in this case considered an accidental death as a result of illegal human experimentation to be an appropriate, effective, and less-damning cover story than the truth. However, Hersh explained that he cannot elaborate or publish on the facts because it would compromise his source.&lt;ref name="villagevoice.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4134">'''Galberos''' ({{lang|ja|ガルベロス}} ''Garuberosu''), also known as '''Gelberos''' is a fictional [[kaiju]] featured in the [[tokusatsu]] TV series, ''[[Ultraman Nexus]]''. Galberos appeared in episodes 6, 17, 18, and 35.

Subtitle: {{nihongo|Space Beast|宇宙大怪獣|Uchū Daikaijū}}.

== Ultraman Nexus ==
=== Stats ===
His height is around 52 Meters tall. He weighs around 39,000 Tons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hicbc.com/tv/nexus/secret/beast/003/index.htm Galberos's bio in Ultraman Nexus]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
Chronologically, Galberos is the first Space Beast to appear on Earth. Shortly after Jun fuses with Ultraman Nexus for the first time, Galberos appears rampaging in a field. Ultraman Nexus appears shortly after, turning into his Junis Red mode and creating a meta field around them. Luckily for Nexus, Galberos is no match for Nexus's speed and is soon destroyed by Nexus's Core Impulse attack. 

Some time later after Nosferu is destroyed, Dark Mephisto revives Galberos shortly afterwards to attack the Night Raiders while Jun confronts Mizorogi (Dark Mephisto's human form.) With no other choice, Jun transforms into Ultraman Nexus to face Galberos inside another meta field while Mizorogi escaped. Once again the battle was in Nexus's favor as now the Night Raiders are fighting Galberos too. However, the odds change after Galberos uses hypnosis to make the Night Raiders attack Nexus instead. With that opportunity, Galberos bites into Nexus's left arm, creating an internal wound to which is to be exploited again in the future for Nexus. Luckily, The Night Raiders eventually shake off the hypnosis and attack the space beast along with Nexus. But before they can finish off Galberos, Dark Mephisto arrives and teleports Galberos and himself away to safety. Dark Mephisto (as Mizorogi) later summons Galberos after creating a dark field to his advantage in fighting the Night Raiders. Jun turns into Ultraman Nexus again, but is still in pain from the wound Galberos left on his arm. Mizorogi protects Galberos with a force field from Night Raiders until one of the members, Nagi shoots him in the back. Without Mizorogi/Dark Mephisto's protection, the dark field disappears and Galberos is soon destroyed by Ultraman Nexus's Over-Ray Storm. 

Many months later Galberos is revived once again, this time by The Unknown Hand to assist another Space Beast, Mega Flash. With Nexus fighting two space beasts, the hero is soon overpowered by his adversaries. Ultraman Nexus however does not give up and after using the Ultimate Vanisher to destroy Mega Flash, Galberos is slain shortly afterwards by the Sword Storm.

== Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle: Never Ending Odyssey ==
This Monster reappears in the series [[Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle: Never Ending Odyssey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daikaijyu.com/galaxy/monster/galberos.html Galberos's bio in Ultra Galaxy NEO]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this series, Galberos belongs to an [[Alien Nackle]]. He is first used (unseen) killing  [[Earthtron]] that belongs to an Alien Zelan. Later on, Nackle summons him again to create hypnotic illusions of the monster [[Zetton]] to fight Rei and his [[Gomora (Ultra monster)|Gomora]]. Whenever it seems that Zetton is destroyed, he "returns" to fight and tire out both Rei and Gomora into becoming weak. Once the duo is weakened enough, Galberos reveals himself and attacks the exhausted Gomora. Suddenly pushed to their limits, Reimon becomes overcome with Reiblood energy and rage, transforming him into Burst Mode Reimon, Gomora too gains the form ''Reionic Burst Gomora''. Now with uncontrolled power, Gomora vaporizes Galberos instantly and his master is short to follow.

== Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy ==
This Monster reappears in the movie [[Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy]].

Galberos is one of Ultraman Belial's 100 Monster Army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc250/godzillarunt/aexvup.jpg Galberos as seen in the Ultra Galaxy film]&lt;/ref&gt; Right after [[Red King (Ultra monster)|Red King]] is destroyed, Zero hits him and is killed

'''George Lansing Fox''' (March 15, 1900&amp;nbsp;– February 3, 1943) was a [[Methodist]] [[Minister of religion|minister]] and a [[lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army]]. He was one of the [[Four Chaplains]] who gave their lives to save other [[soldier]]s during the sinking of the troop transport {{SS|Dorchester||2}} during [[World War II]].

==Life==
George L. Fox was born in [[Lewistown, Pennsylvania]] in 1900, one of five children. At 17 he ran away to join the army and served on the Western Front during [[World War I]] as a medical orderly, receiving the [[Silver Star]], the [[Purple Heart]] and the [[Croix de Guerre]] for his meritorious service. Following the war, Fox completed high school and briefly worked for a Trust Company. Fox married in 1923 and his son, Wyatt Ray was born a year later. Fox studied at [[Moody Bible Institute]] and [[Illinois Wesleyan University]], graduating in 1931. Following graduation, Fox became an itinerant Methodist preacher, holding posts in [[Downs, Illinois]] and [[Rye, New Hampshire]] before joining the [[Boston University School of Theology]] and becoming an ordained minister in 1934.

That same year, he took over the church in [[Waits River, Vermont]], and his daughter, Mary Elizabeth, was born. He remained in Vermont, moving church twice and becoming the state chaplain and historian for the [[American Legion]]. Fox joined the army again in 1942. His son enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] on the same day. Fox was united with the other Four Chaplains for his voyage to Europe later that year following a position in the chaplain's school in [[Harvard]], and departed with over 900 soldiers on the ''Dorchester'' in January 1943.

==Death==

In late 1942, Fox was transferred to Camp Myles Standish in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]] and attended Chaplains School at [[Harvard University]]. There he met fellow chaplains [[Alexander D. Goode]], [[Clark V. Poling]] and [[John P. Washington]]. In January 1943, the chaplains embarked on board a Navy transport ship, the [[SS Dorchester]], which was carrying over 900 soldiers to the United Kingdom, via [[Greenland]].

On February 2, 1943 the German submarine [[German submarine U-223|''U-223'']] spotted the convoy and fired a torpedo which struck the Dorchester shortly after midnight. Hundreds of men packed the decks of the rapidly sinking ship and scrambled for the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]]. Several of the lifeboats had been damaged and the four chaplains began to organize frightened soldiers. They distributed [[Personal flotation device|life jackets]] from a locker; when the supply of life jackets ran out, each of the chaplains gave theirs to other soldiers. When the last lifeboats were away, the chaplains prayed with those unable to escape the sinking ship. 27 minutes after the torpedo struck, the ''Dorchester'' disappeared below the waves with 672 men still aboard. The last anyone saw of the four chaplains, they were standing on the deck, arms linked and praying together.&lt;ref name="S4C"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourchaplains.org/story.html |title=The Saga of the Four Chaplains |accessdate=2008-02-05 |publisher=The Four Chaplains Memorial Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207070224/http://www.fourchaplains.org/story.html |archivedate=2008-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remembrance==
[[File:Four Chaplains stamp1.png|thumb|left|Four Chaplains stamp, 1948]]
The four chaplains were all awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and the [[Purple Heart]] and received national acclaim for their courage and self-sacrifice. A chapel in their honor was dedicated on February 3, 1951 by President [[Harry S. Truman]] at [[Grace Baptist Church of Philadelphia]]. The [[Chaplain's Medal for Heroism|Four Chaplains' Medal]] was established by act of Congress on July 14, 1960, and was presented posthumously to their next of kin by Secretary of the Army Wilber M. Brucker at Ft. Myer, Virginia on January 18, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxfall.com/fmc-fcm.htm | title = Federal Military Medals and Decorations | publisher = Foxfall Medals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox is honored with a [[feast day]] along with the other Four Chaplains on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] on February 3.

'''Henry Kulky''' (born '''Henry Kulakowich'''; August 11, 1911 – February 12, 1965) was an [[United States|American]] [[actor]] and [[professional wrestler]] from [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-on-Hudson]], [[New York (state)|New York]], probably best remembered as [[Chief Petty Officer]] Curly Jones from season 1 of ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]''.

==Career==
Kulky began boxing in his teenage years. After six bouts, he stopped boxing when he was offered a position training wrestlers at St. Matthew's Lyceum in his native Hastings-on-Hudson.&lt;ref name=slam&gt;{{cite web|title=From the mat to the Bottom of the Sea|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Movies/2007/10/27/4610208.html|accessdate=2009-12-06|date=2007-10-27|first=Greg|last=Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanislaus Zbyszko]] convinced Kulky to compete professionally in 1939. Moving to Argentina, Kulky competed throughout South America under the [[ring name]] '''Bomber Kulkavich'''. The number of matches in which he competed is uncertain; one claim states that he won 172 of 175 matches. Kulky, however, claims that he won nearly all of 7,000 matches. While in [[South America]], he is also said to have won the continent's [[judo]] crown.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

Like most wrestlers who turned to acting in the 1950s he owed his big break to [[Mike Mazurki]]. The two appeared in several parts in the 1940s and 1950s, with Mazurki's agent getting him a part in ''[[Call Northside 777]]''.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

Because of his rather tough guy image, Kulky became typecast as military men, thugs, gangsters, bartenders, wrestlers and other "strong guys" who were at times quite friendly and lovable characters contrasting strongly with the tough guy image. From 1953 to 1958, he played Otto Schmidlap in the [[television series]], ''[[The Life of Riley]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vttbots.com/kulky_bio.html Kulky Bio]&lt;/ref&gt; In the series, Kulky portrayed a co-worker of series character Chester Riley, a wing riveter at an aircraft plant. In 1952 he appeared in an episode (#11) of [[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]], as a wrestler working for a crooked promoter. In 1954 he appeared in an episode (#141) of [[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]. From 1959 to 1962, Kulky was cast in the recurring role as Chief Max Bronsky in forty-six episodes of [[Jackie Cooper]]'s [[CBS]] military sitcom/drama [[television series]], ''[[Hennesey]]''. The role was close to Kulky's heart because during [[World War II]], he was a [[Boatswain's Mate (US Navy)|boatswain's mate]] in the [[United States Navy]].

Kulky's last role was as Chief Curley Jones in the television series ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]''.

==Death==
Kulky died on February 12, 1965 in [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]], [[California]], of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] suffered while he was studying a script.

'''Heterothermy''' or '''heterothermia''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἕτερος ''heteros'' "other" and θέρμη ''thermē'' "heat") is a physiological term for [[animal]]s that vary between self-regulating their body temperature, and allowing the surrounding environment to affect it. In other words, they exhibit characteristics of both [[poikilothermy]] and [[homeothermy]].

==Definition==
Heterothermic animals are those that can switch between [[poikilotherm]]ic and [[homeotherm]]ic strategies. These changes in strategies typically occur on a daily basis or on an annual basis. More often than not, it is used as a way to dissociate the fluctuating [[Basal_metabolic_rate|metabolic rates]] seen in some small mammals and birds (e.g. [[bat]]s and [[hummingbirds]]), from those of traditional [[Poikilotherm|cold blooded]] animals. In many [[bat]] species, body temperature and metabolic rate are elevated only during activity. When at rest, these animals reduce their [[metabolism]]s drastically, which results in their body temperature dropping to that of the surrounding environment. This makes them [[homeothermic]] when active, and [[poikilothermic]] when at rest. This phenomenon has been termed 'daily [[torpor]]' and was intensively studied in the [[Djungarian hamster]]. During the [[hibernation]] season, this animal shows strongly reduced metabolism each day during the rest phase while they revert to [[endotherm|endothermic]] metabolism during their active phase, leading to normal euthermic{{Definition needed|date=June 2018}}  body temperatures (around 38&amp;nbsp;°C).

Larger mammals (e.g. [[ground squirrel]]s) and [[bat]]s show multi-day torpor bouts during hibernation (up to several weeks) in winter.&lt;ref name=Hut&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hut|first=RA|author2=Barnes, BM |author3=Daan, S |title=Body temperature patterns before, during, and after semi-natural hibernation in the European ground squirrel.|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B|date=Jan 2002|volume=172|issue=1|pages=47–58|pmid=11824403|doi=10.1007/s003600100226}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these multi-day torpor bouts, body temperature drops to ~1&amp;nbsp;°C above ambient temperature and metabolism may drop to about 1% of the normal endothermic metabolic rate. Even in these deep hibernators, the long periods of torpor is interrupted by bouts of endothermic metabolism, called arousals (typically lasting between 4–20 hours). These metabolic arousals cause body temperature to return to euthermic levels 35-37&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Hut/&gt; Most of the energy spent during hibernation is spent in arousals (70-80%), but their function remains unresolved.

Shallow hibernation patterns without arousals have been described in large mammals (like the black bear,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tøien|first=Ø |author2=Blake, J |author3=Edgar, DM |author4=Grahn, DA |author5=Heller, HC |author6=Barnes, BM|title=Hibernation in black bears: independence of metabolic suppression from body temperature|journal=Science|date=Feb 18, 2011|volume=331|issue=6019|pages=906–9|pmid=21330544|bibcode=2011Sci...331..906T|doi=10.1126/science.1199435}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or under special environmental circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dausmann|first=KH |author2=Glos, J |author3=Ganzhorn, JU |author4=Heldmaier, G|title=Physiology: hibernation in a tropical primate|journal=Nature|date=Jun 24, 2004|volume=429|issue=6994|pages=825–6|pmid=15215852|bibcode=2004Natur.429..825D|doi=10.1038/429825a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional heterothermy==
Regional heterothermy describes organisms that are able to maintain different temperature "zones" in different regions of the body. This usually occurs in the limbs, and is made possible through the use of counter-current heat exchangers, such as the [[rete mirabile]] found in tuna and certain birds.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, S, L. 2002. ‘Design of heterothermic muscle in fish’, The Journal of Experimental Biology 205, 2251–2266.&lt;/ref&gt; These exchangers equalize the temperature between hot arterial blood going out to the extremities and cold venous blood coming back, thus reducing heat loss. Penguins and many arctic [[birds]] use these exchangers to keep their feet at roughly the same temperature as the surrounding ice. This keeps the [[birds]] from getting stuck on an ice sheet. Other animals, like the [[Leatherback Sea Turtle]], use the heat exchangers to gather, and retain heat generated by their muscular flippers.&lt;ref&gt;James, Michael; Mrosovsky, N. 2004. 'Body temperatures of leatherback turtles (''Dermochelys coriacea'') in temperate waters off Nova Scotia, Canada', Canadian Journal of Zoology 82, 1302–1306&lt;/ref&gt; There are even some [[insect]]s which possess this mechanism (see [[insect thermoregulation]]), the best-known example being [[bumblebee]]s, which exhibit counter-current heat exchange at the point of constriction between the [[mesosoma]] ("thorax") and [[metasoma]] ("abdomen"); heat is retained in the thorax and lost from the abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernd Heinrich|Heinrich, B.]] 1976. 'Heat exchange in relation to blood flow between thorax and abdomen in bumblebees', Journal of Experimental Biology 64, 561–585&lt;/ref&gt; Using a very similar mechanism, the internal temperature of a [[honeybee]]'s thorax can exceed 45&amp;nbsp;°C while in flight.

[[Captain (naval)|Captain]] '''Hugh Talbot Burgoyne''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]] [[Royal Navy|RN]] (17 July 1833 &amp;ndash; 7 September 1870) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]]. Born in [[Dublin]], he was the son of [[John Fox Burgoyne]] and the grandson of [[John Burgoyne]].

Burgoyne was a 21-year-old [[Royal Navy]] lieutenant, serving in the [[Crimean War]] when he performed the deed for which he was awarded the VC.

==Details==
On 29 May 1855, in the [[Sea of Azov]], [[Crimea]], Lieutenant Burgoyne of [[HMS Swallow (1854)|HMS ''Swallow'']], with [[Cecil William Buckley|Lieutenant Cecil William Buckley]] from [[HMS Miranda (1851)|HMS ''Miranda'']] and Gunner John Robarts from [[HMS Ardent (1841)|HMS ''Ardent'']], volunteered to land at a beach where the Russian army were in strength. They were out of covering gunshot range of the ships offshore and met considerable enemy opposition, but managed to set fire to corn stores and [[ammunition dump]]s and destroy enemy equipment before embarking again.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=21971 |date=24 February 1857 |page=650 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burgoyne was [[Commander]] on [[HMS Ganges (1821)|HMS ''Ganges'']] under [[John Fulford|Captain John Fulford]] during that vessel's service in the waters of the [[Colony of Vancouver Island|Colonies of Vancouver Island]] and [[Colony of British Columbia|British Columbia]] during the fledgling years of the latter colony's establishment.  "When the American merchant ship ''[[Northern Eagle]]'' was burned in [[Esquimalt Royal Navy Dockyard|Esquimalt Harbour]], Captain Burgoyne was highly commended for his efforts to save everything possible from the burning ship. Seamen from the ''Ganges'', [[HMS Pylades (1854)|''Pylades'']], [[HMS Tribune (1853)|''Tribune'']], and [[HMS Plumper (1848)|''Plumper'']] also assisted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elp.gov.bc.ca/bcgn-bin/bcg10?name=2199 Canadian Geographical Names Database, quoted in the British Columbia Geographical Names Database listing "Burgoyne Bay"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
Burgoyne later achieved the rank of captain and was killed when in command of [[HMS Captain (1869)|HMS ''Captain'']], which capsized off [[Cape Finisterre]] during a [[gale]] on 7 September 1870. This revolutionary masted [[turret ship]] had been the subject of considerable controversy during its design and construction and its loss was attributed to its poor stability.

Burgoyne is buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]], London towards the north-east corner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brompton.org/Residents.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Burgoyne Bay]] in [[British Columbia]] was named after him in 1859.

St. Paul’s Cathedral, London houses a memorial to Burgoyne and the Officers, Marines, Men and Boys who perished off the South African Coast.

An '''immature ovum''' is a cell that goes through the process of [[oogenesis]] to become an [[ovum]]. It can be an [[oogonium]], an [[oocyte]], or an [[ootid]]. An oocyte, in turn, can be either primary or secondary, depending on how far it has come in its process of [[meiosis]].

==Oogonium==
{{Main|Oogonium}}
[[Oogonia]] are the cells that turn into primary oocytes in oogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/oogonium?cat=health answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt; They are diploid, i.e. containing both pairs of homologous chromosomes. There are 23 chromosome pairs. Thus, there are 46 chromosomes. Each chromosome, however, hasn't yet duplicated itself. As such, there is only one chromatid on each chromosome, making the total quantity of chromatids 46. This is twice the number of chromosome pairs (2N).

Oogonia are created in early [[embryo]]nic life. All have turned into primary oocytes at late fetal age.

==Primary oocyte==
{{Main|Oocyte}}
The primary oocyte is defined by its process of [[ootidogenesis]], which is meiosis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-P/primary_oocyte.html Biochem]&lt;/ref&gt; It has duplicated its DNA, so that each chromosome has two chromatids, i.e. 92 chromatids all in all (4C).

When meiosis I is completed, one secondary oocyte and one [[polar body]] is created.

Primary oocytes have been created in late fetal life. This is the stage where immature ova spend most of their lifetime, more specifically in prophase I of meiosis. The halt is called [[dictyate]]. Most degenerate by [[atresia]], but a few go through [[ovulation]], and that's the trigger to the next step. Thus, an immature ovum can spend up to ~55 years as a primary oocyte (the last ovulation before [[menopause]]).

==Secondary oocyte==
{{Main|Oocyte}}
The secondary oocyte is the cell that is formed by meiosis I in oogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-S/secondary_oocyte.html Biochem]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it has only one of each pair of homologous chromosomes. In other words, it is haploid. However, each chromosome still has two chromatids, making a total of 46 chromatids (1N but 2C). The secondary oocyte continues the second stage of meiosis (meiosis II), and the daughter cells are one ootid and one [[polar body]].

Secondary oocytes are the immature ovum shortly after ovulation, to [[fertilization]], where it turns into an ootid. Thus, the time as a secondary oocyte is measured in days.

The secondary oocyte is the largest cell in the body, and in humans is just visible to the naked eye.

==Ootid==
An ''ootid'' is the haploid result of ootidogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/ahd/o/o0086200.html yourdictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; In oogenesis, it doesn't really have any significance in itself, since it is very similar to the ovum. However, it fills the purpose as the female counterpart of the male [[spermatid]] in [[spermatogenesis]].

Each chromosome is split between the two ootids, leaving only one chromatid per chromosome. Thus, there are 23 chromatids in total (1N).

In other words, the ootid is the immature ovum formed shortly after fertilization, but before complete maturation into an ovum. Thus, the time spent as an ootid is measured in minutes.

==Ovum==
{{Main|Ovum}}
The ootid matures into an [[ovum]].

The jauhar sati dies before and while her husband fights what appears to be an unwinnable battle. By dying, she frees him from worry about her welfare and saves herself from the possible shame of rape by triumphant enemy forces."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Veena Oldenburg, the roots of this practice "almost certainly" lie in the internecine warfare among different Rajput kingdoms.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Veena Oldenburg, A Comment to Ashis Nandy's "Sati as Profit versus Sati as Spectacle: The Public Debate on Roop Kanwar's Death," in Hawley, Sati the Blessing and the Curse: The Burning of Wives in India, page 165&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Kaushik Roy said that the ''jauhar'' custom was observed only during Hindu-Muslim wars, but not during internecine Hindu-Hindu wars among the Rajputs.&lt;ref name=KaushikRoy182/&gt;

The term ''jauhar'' sometimes connotes with both ''jauhar''-immolation and ''saka'' ritual. During the Jauhar, Rajput women committed suicide with their children and valuables in massive fire, to avoid capture and abuse in the face of inescapable military defeat and capture.&lt;ref name=harlan160/&gt;&lt;ref name=claude58/&gt; Simultaneously or thereafter, the men would ritually march to the battlefield expecting certain death, which in the regional tradition is called ''saka''.&lt;ref name=battin285/&gt;

''Jauhar'' by Hindu kingdoms has been documented by Islamic historians of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and the [[Mughal Empire]].&lt;ref name=claude58&gt;{{cite book|author=Claude Markovits|title=A History of Modern India, 1480-1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r2OKvG5wbaAC |year=2004|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-1-84331-152-2|pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dirk H.

==Etymology==
The word ''jauhar'' is connected to Sanskrit ''jatugr̥ha'' "house plastered with lac and other combustible materials for burning people alive in".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:1287.soas | title=A Comparative Dictionary of the Indo-Aryan Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==
The practice of Jauhar is culturally related to ''[[Sati (practice)|Sati]]'' with both a form of suicide by women, although it occurred for different reasons.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Veena Oldenburg, A Comment to Ashis Nandy's "Sati as Profit versus Sati as Spectacle: The Public Debate on Roop Kanwar's Death," in Hawley, Sati the Blessing and the Curse: The Burning of Wives in India, page 165&lt;/ref&gt; Sati was the custom of a widow to commit suicide by self-immolation on her husband's funeral pyre, while Jauhar was collective self-immolation by women to escape abuse and rape and slavery,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-uviBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96&amp;lpg=PT96&amp;dq=%E2%80%98Ala%E2%80%99+al-Din+Khalji+(r.+1296-1316)+owned+some+50,000+slave-boys&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8Gce5g8kGH&amp;sig=YHGUAHqui_lNrHYFRQrWvLejAwc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOtvKax6bZAhUD6YMKHfSABq0Q6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%98Ala%E2%80%99%20al-Din%20Khalji%20(r.%201296-1316)%20owned%20some%2050%2C000%20slave-boys&amp;f=false  Caravans: Punjabi Khatri Merchants on the Silk Road, Scott Levi, Penguin UK, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; when they expected certain defeat at the hands of enemy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=harlan160/&gt;

Scholars disagree about the roots of this custom. Veena Oldenburg states that the roots of this practice "almost certainly" lie in the internecine Rajput warfare.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Kaushik Roy states, in contrast, that the ''jauhar'' custom was observed only during Hindu-Muslim wars, but not during internecine Hindu-Hindu wars among the Rajputs.&lt;ref name=KaushikRoy182&gt;Kaushik Roy (2012), Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia: From Antiquity to the Present, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1107017368}}, pages 182-184&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of ''jauhar'' has been reported by Hindus and Muslims differently. In the Hindu traditions, ''jauhar'' was a heroic act by a community facing certain defeat and abuse by the enemy.&lt;ref name=harlan160/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lindsey Harlan|author2=Paul B. Courtright|title=From the Margins of Hindu Marriage: Essays on Gender, Religion, and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pi7xAWStawYC |year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-508117-6|pages=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some Muslim historians, it was unwilling and a throwing away of lives.&lt;ref name=battin285/&gt; But [[Amir Khusrau]] described it, states Arvind Sharma – a professor of Comparative Religion, as "no doubt magical and superstitious; nevertheless they are heroic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=Sati: Historical and Phenomenological Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJmWgz2mv5oC&amp;pg=PA21 |year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0464-7|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Among the more cited cases of Jauhar are the three occurrences at the fort of [[Chittaur]] (Chittaurgarh, Chittorgarh), in Rajasthan, in 1303,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Main Battles |url=http://chittorgarh.nic.in/battles.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206083524/http://chittorgarh.nic.in/battles.htm |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1535, and 1568 CE.{{sfn|Dirk H.

=== Jauhar-like suicide of the Agalassoi: Alexander the Great ===
The mass self-immolation by the [[Agalassoi]] tribe of northwest India is mentioned in Book 6 of ''[[The Anabasis of Alexander]]'', [[Arrian]]'s 2nd-century CE  military history of [[Alexander the Great]] between 336 and 323 BCE. Arrian mentions Alexander's army conquering and enslaving peoples of the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]]. During a war that killed many in the Macedonian and Agalossoi armies, the civilians despaired of defeat. Some 20,000 men, women and children of an Agalossoi town set fire to the town and cast themselves into the flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Arthur Smith|title=The Early History of India from 600 B.C. to the Muhammadan Conquest: Including the Invasion of Alexander the Great|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9a1AAAAIAAJ|year=1914|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=93–94 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Anabasis_of_Alexander/Book_VI The Anabasis of Alexander/Book VI]  by Arrian, translated by E.

In 1301, [[Alauddin Khalji]] of [[Delhi Sultanate]] besieged and [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Ranthambore|conquered the Ranthambore fort]]. When faced with a certain defeat, the defending ruler [[Hammiradeva]] decided to fight to death with his soldiers, and his minister Jaja supervised the organization of a ''jauhar''. The queens, daughters and other female relatives of Hammiradeva committed suicide in this jauhar.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=118-119}} The ''jauhar'' at Ranthambore has been described by Alauddin's courtier [[Amir Khusrau]],{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=368}} which makes it the first ''jauhar'' to be described in a [[Persian language]] text.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2007|p=97}}

The Hindu king Medini Rao ruled over [[Chanderi]] in northern [[Madhya Pradesh]] in early 16th century. He tried to help [[Rana Sanga]] in the [[Battle of Khanua]] against the Muslim armies of [[Babur]], the founder of the [[Mughal Empire]]. In January 1528 CE, his fort was overwhelmed by the invading forces of [[Babur]]. The women and children of the Chanderi fort committed ''jauhar'', the men dressed up in saffron garments and walked the ritual of ''saka'' on 29 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sunil Kumar Sarker|title=Himu, the Hindu "Hero" of Medieval India: Against the Background of Afghan-Mughal Conflicts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H8GH0MBWfcoC&amp;pg=PA83|year=1994|publisher=Atlantic Publishers |isbn=978-81-7156-483-5|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second Jauhar of Chittor: Bahadur Shah ===
[[Rana Sanga]] died in 1528 CE after the [[Battle of Khanwa]]. Shortly afterwards, Mewar and [[Chittor]] came under the regency of his widow, [[Rani Karnavati]]. The kingdom was besieged by [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat]]. Rani committed Jauhar with other women on 8 March 1535, while the Rajput army rallied out to meet the besieging Muslim army and committed saka.&lt;ref&gt;R.K. Gupta, S.R. Bakshi, Studies In Indian History: Rajasthan Through The Ages The Heritage Of ..., page 124&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chittorgarh faced an imminent attack from the Sultan of Gujarat, Karnavati sought the assistance of the Mughal emperor [[Humayun]] by sending him a ''[[Raksha Bandhan|rakhi]]''. Before Humayun could reach Chittorgarh, Bahadur Shah sacked the fort for the second time. Rani Karnavati with 13,000 women shut themselves with gunpowder, lit it and thus committed mass suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Everett Jenkins, Jr.|title=The Muslim Diaspora (Volume 2, 1500-1799): A Comprehensive Chronology of the Spread of Islam in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxAkCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58|year=2000|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-4689-6|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third Jauhar of Chittor: Akbar ===
The armies of Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] besieged the Rajput fort of [[Chittor]] in September 1567.&lt;ref&gt;R.K. Gupta, S.R. Bakshi, Studies In Indian History: Rajasthan Through The Ages The Heritage Of ..., page 125&lt;/ref&gt; After his army conquered Chittorgarh in Rajasthan, Hindu women committed ''jauhar'' in spring of 1568 CE, and the next morning, thousands of Rajput men walked the saka ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Annemarie Schimmel|editor=Burzine K.

Abu'l-Fazl states that the women were victims of Rajput men and unwilling participants, and these Rajputs came out walking to die, throwing away their lives.&lt;ref name=battin285/&gt; According to David Smith, when Akbar entered the Chittorgarh fort in 1568, it was "nothing but an immense crematorium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Smith|title=Hinduism and Modernity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-aRSuypah8C&amp;pg=PA54|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-77685-8|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lindsey Harlan, the ''jauhar'' of 1568 is a part of regional legend and is locally remembered on the Hindu festival of [[Holi]] as a day of Chittorgarh massacre by the Akbar army, with "the red color signifying the blood that flowed on that day".&lt;ref name=harlan162/&gt;

=== Three Jauhars of Raisen: Humayun ===
[[Raisen]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]] was repeatedly attacked by the Mughal Army in the early 16th century. In 1528, the first ''jauhar'' was led by Rani Chanderi.{{sfn|Dirk H. A. Kolff|2002|p=85}} After the Mughal army left, the kingdom refused to accept orders from Delhi. After a long siege of Raisen fort, that exhausted all supplies within the fort, [[Rani Durgavati]] and 700 Raisen women committed the second ''jauhar'' in 1532, the men led by Lakshman Tuar committed ''saka''.{{sfn|Dirk H. A. Kolff|2002|pp=99-103}} This refusal to submit to Mughal rule repeated, and in 1543 the third ''jauhar'' was led by Rani Ratnavali.{{sfn|Dirk H. A. Kolff|2002|p=85}}

=== Jauhar of Bundelkhand: Aurangzeb ===
[[Aurangzeb]] with three army battalions lay siege of [[Bundelkhand|Bundela]] in Madhya Pradesh in December 1634 CE. The resident women committed ''jauhar'' as the fort fell. Aurangzeb's army entered the fort. Those who had not completed the ritual and survived the ''jauhar'' in progress were forced into the [[harem]], men were forced to convert to Islam, those who refused were executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.R.

[[File:Pinard horn Uganda US Army nurse.jpg|thumb|A [[U.S. Army Reserve]] [[nurse]] uses a Pinard horn in [[Uganda]] (2009).]]
A '''Pinard horn''' is a type of [[stethoscope]] used to listen the heart rate of a [[fetus]] during pregnancy. It is a hollow horn, often made of wood or metal, about {{convert|8|in}} long. It functions similarly to an [[ear trumpet]] by amplifying sound. The user holds the wide end of the horn against the pregnant woman's abdomen, and listens through the other end.&lt;ref name="DF1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robbie Davis-Floyd |author2=Carolyn Fishel Sargent |title=Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross-Cultural Perspectives|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520207851|pages=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Pinard horn was invented by Dr. [[Adolphe Pinard]], a French [[obstetrician]], during the 19th century.&lt;ref name="DF1997"/&gt; Pinard was an early supporter of advancements in [[prenatal care]], including closer fetal health monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Jeffrey P.|title=The Machine in the Nursery: Incubator Technology and the Origins of Newborn Intensive Care|year=1996|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=9780801851735|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current use==
Pinard horns continue to be used around the world, particularly by [[midwife|midwives]], but also by doctors and nurses. Pinard horns are the most common fetal stethoscopes in much of Europe, even today, which surprises some doctors from the United States, where a [[Doppler fetal monitor]] is standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ina May Gaskin |author2=Ani DiFranco |title=Birth Matters: A Midwife's Manifesta|year=2011|publisher=Seven Stories Press|isbn=9781583229279|pages=112–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides an alternative to more expensive Doppler. Another alternative is the fetoscope, which is a stethoscope designed for auscultating fetuses. A midwife in Mexico describes using the Pinard horn:
{{blockquote|Sometimes we listen to the fetal heart rate with the Pinard, but if the woman is very sensitive, and it bothers her to push into her belly with the Pinard horn, then we use the Doppler. But the Doppler often transmits a lot of noise; it gets confusing. So better with the Pinard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robbie Davis-Floyd |author2=Lesley Barclay |author3=Jan Tritten |title=Birth Models that Work|year=2009|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520248632|pages=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A Pinard horn may be used to determine the position of the fetus. A Pinard horn is more precise than a Doppler device for this purpose. A Doppler device detects a heart tone farther away from the location of origin. A Pinard horn must be pressed to a location very close to the fetal heart in order to detect it, providing a more accurate indication of fetal position. A doctor, nurse, or midwife can also use [[palpation]] and [[auscultation]] to determine fetal position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Penny Simkin |author2=Ruth Ancheta |title=The Labor Progress Handbook: Early Interventions to Prevent and Treat Dystocia|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444337716|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pippa Funnell 2: Take the Reins''''' (released as ''Alexandra Ledermann: L'Ecole des Champions'' in France, and ''Champion Dreams: First to Ride'' in North America) is a horse riding simulation game developed by French studio Lexis Numerique and released by [[Ubisoft]] on October 27, 2006 for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Windows]]. The player takes the role of Jade as she attends the Sycamore Riding School in [[Scotland]]. Throughout the game, the player is able to train, care for, and compete with their horse while interacting with the other students in the Academy, and solving a mystery.

The game is named after famous horse riders in [[Europe]]: [[Pippa Funnell]] ([[Great Britain]]) and [[Alexandra Ledermann]] ([[France]]), and is part of a series of games.

==Gameplay==
To begin the game, the player must choose a name for themselves and select the horse they will use. There are many breeds to choose from, as well as colours, but none have impact on performance. After the horse is named, the story begins with Jade on her way to the Academy. Throughout the game, the students and Jade travel to the [[United States|USA]] and [[Morocco]] to train and compete against other riding schools.

The player (as Jade) must take "classes" to progress through the week, with a competition to prepare for each weekend. Training for each riding discipline ([[dressage]], [[Show jumping|show-jumping]], and [[Cross-country equestrianism|cross-country]]) and horse care must be done at least twice each week, in addition to maintaining a high social rating by interacting with the other students and wearing stylish clothes.

Occasionally, an event may take place that overrides the class chosen. In these events the player may be helped by a "voice" with the name Elsys. The player should be mindful to do required activities earlier in the week to ensure they are completed before the competition. If the player does not score high enough in one or more of the required activities, the week must be repeated.&lt;ref&gt;Game Manual&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities/Classes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://girlshorseclub.com/blog/game-walkthrough-pippa-funnell-take-the-reins-pc/2007/05/29/|title=Game Walkthrough: Pippa Funnell - Take The Reins (PC) • Girls Horse Club Blog|date=2007-05-29|work=Girls Horse Club Blog|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
'''Horse Care:''' The player is able to care for their horse by mucking the stall, picking the hoofs, bathing, and grooming him. It is best to complete this activity 4-5 times per week to maintain the best happiness levels for the horse.

'''Foal Care:''' After obtaining the foal, it must be cared for. The foal will perform three actions, and the player must give the foal what it needs based on them. The player can find clues about what each action means by reading books in the library.

'''Cross-Country:''' The player rides their horse through an outdoor, long-distance jumping course than uses solid objects, such as fencing or logs, as jumps. The event is timed, with a time-limit, and the rider with the least number of faults and fastest time wins. When approaching a jump, wait for the circle in front to turn green, then press the spacebar (X button for PlayStation 2) to attempt the jump. If the circle is not green, or the jump is approached at an angle, the horse will refuse, resulting in faults and lost time. Too many refusals and the rider will be disqualified.

'''Show-Jumping:''' This takes place in the arena, using jumps that will fall if knocked. Similar to cross-country, faults are given for refusals and knocking down rails, and the event is timed. Instead of circles in front of the jumps, there is a bar that changes from red to green. Approach the jump straight and press the spacebar (X button) when the bar is green coloured to clear the jump.

'''Dressage:''' Use the arrow keys to follow the path on the ground, while maintaining the correct gait. In the first few weeks, it is recommended that the player read the dressage books in the library to learn how to perform the different maneuvers required in later weeks.

'''Walk:''' The player takes their horse out for a trail ride, and can explore the grounds around the Academy, or the local areas while abroad. There is no time limits or other requirements, but it will improve the horse's happiness. It can be helpful to use this activity to become somewhat familiar with each area, as later events in the game can take place there.

'''Rest Room:''' This activity is for raising popularity with the other students by talking with them. The player can talk to two students (or one student twice) each time this activity is chosen. Use this time to learn about each student's personality and other helpful tips for the mystery part of the game.

'''Bedroom:''' The player can change their clothes (casual, and for each riding event) as well as their horse's equipment to try to earn more popularity points. Jade has a laptop that may also be used for research and online shopping. Websites can be found throughout the game.

'''Library:''' Here the player can read up on dressage moves or how to care for their horse and foal.

'''Competitions:''' At the end of each week, a competition is held that the player must perform well at to get the best ending. There are three rounds to each competition: dressage, cross-country, and show-jumping. Each event's scores are added together to produce an overall standing. Each week features different courses, increasing in difficulty as the games progresses.

==Characters==
'''Jade:''' The main character that the player controls. She has short red hair, grey eyes, and freckles. She has a strong personality, but is overall friendly and kind.

'''Spike:''' Male with spikey blonde hair. He has a bit of a dangerous background, and is only at the Academy because of his parents. A bit of a rebel, he doesn't hold back what he wants to say.

'''Ginger:''' Female with long blonde hair and fair skin. She is fun-loving but strong enough to deal with the others.

'''Esteban:''' Spanish male with short black hair, blue eyes, and tanned skin. He has a gentle and welcoming personality and likes to dress with a bit of class.

'''Kiew:''' Asian female with long black hair. She is very competitive and takes every chance she can to race the others, either on horseback or in the swimming pool. She does not like to be defeated.

'''Director:''' The director of the academy, He has balding white hair and mustache and beard. He appears at the beginning of the game and before competitions.

'''Harry:''' Short white hair and mustache/beard. He is a bit gruff, but instructs the students on how to properly care for their horses.

==Sequels==
There are two direct sequels to this game: ''[[Pippa Funnell 3: Golden Stirrup Challenge]]'' (''Horsez'' in North America), and ''[[Pippa Funnel 4: Secrets of the Ranch]]'' (''Horsez 2''). In ''Golden Stirrup Challenge'', the player attends Jade's new riding school as a new character Flora.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pippafunnellgame.com/home.php|title=Pippa Funnell Take the Reins: Official Website : actualités|date=2010-11-21|access-date=2017-12-10|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121123134/http://pippafunnellgame.com/home.php|archivedate=2010-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Secrets of the Ranch'', Flora owns a farm that the player works at as another new character Emma.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10022">'''Pregnancy options counseling''' is a form of [[counseling]] that provides information and support regarding a women's [[pregnancy]]. Woman seeking pregnancy options counseling are typically doing so in the case of an unintended pregnancy. Limited access to birth control and family planning resources, as well as misuse of birth control are some of the major contributing factors to unintended pregnancies around the world. In 2012, the global rate of unintended pregnancies was estimated to be 40 percent, or eighty-five million pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sedgh|first=Gilda|last2=Singh|first2=Susheela|last3=Hussain|first3=Rubina|date=2017-03-27|title=Intended and Unintended Pregnancies Worldwide in 2012 and Recent Trends|journal=Studies in family planning|volume=45|issue=3|pages=301–314|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.2014.00393.x|issn=0039-3665|pmc=4727534|pmid=25207494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pregnancy options counselors educate women about the different options that are available and help guide them to a decision on how to proceed with their pregnancy. The options include [[abortion]], [[adoption]], or [[parenting]]. The job of a pregnancy options counselor is to neither encourage nor discourage a woman’s particular decision, nor do they profit from the woman’s choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.contracept.org/options-counseling.php|title=Options Counseling for Pregnancy|website=www.contracept.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, they present unbiased information about each of the options non-judgmentally, then help the woman explore her feelings and come to a decision that fits her best based on her values, culture, future plans, etc. Pregnancy options counseling centers are not the same thing as [[crisis pregnancy center]]s, which may not provide unbiased information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Abortion ==

One option that a woman with an unplanned pregnancy may consider is [[abortion]], the deliberate termination of a pregnancy. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 40–50 million abortions are performed worldwide each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/abortions/|title=Abortion Statistics - Worldometers|website=www.worldometers.info|language=en|access-date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 20 million of these abortions are considered unsafe and result in around 67,000 deaths each year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/world/12abortion.html|title=Legal or Not, Abortion Rates Compare|last=Rosenthal|first=Elisabeth|date=12 October 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=23 March 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion rates are similar across countries despite its being legal in some and illegal in others. In other words, just as many women get abortions in countries where it is illegal as in countries where it is legal. The only difference is that they proceed with illegal abortions, which are more likely to be provided under unsafe conditions by poorly trained providers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A woman’s pregnancy options in regards to abortion would be presented differently by her counselor, depending on the country they are in. The [[Mexico City policy|Mexico City Policy]] is an example of governments restricting this aspect of pregnancy options counseling.

=== Worldwide abortion policies ===
Different countries have different abortion policies, which are based on the extent to which the unplanned pregnancy is affecting mother and fetus. 96 percent of countries allow abortions to save a woman whose life is at risk. Six countries in the world do not permit the termination of a pregnancy under any circumstance; that is 3% of the worlds countries that don't allow abortion at all. There are 50 countries (26%) that allow an abortion only if it is to save the mother’s life, 82 countries (42%) that allow abortion to save the mother’s life or for at least one of the following reasons: to preserve the woman’s physical health, to preserve the woman’s mental health, in the case of rape or incest, to avoid fetal impairment, or for economic or social reasons. Lastly, 58 countries (30%) allow abortions on request for any reason, though these countries usually do not allow the pregnancy to be terminated beyond a certain stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/06/how-abortion-is-regulated-around-the-world/|title=How abortion is regulated around the world|date=6 October 2015|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=23 March 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of abortion ===
Should a pregnant woman’s country allow her to get an abortion, a pregnancy counselor can help her to address the tough questions that might arise and give her information on the types of abortion. Once a woman has decided on abortion, there are two ways in which one can be induced. The first type of abortion is a medical abortion that involves the use of drugs. This option is only feasible within the first 9 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/abortion/article_em.htm|title=Abortion: Get Facts About the Procedure and Statistics|work=eMedicineHealth|access-date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the only other option is a surgical abortion which involves the removal of the placenta and fetus.

== Adoption ==
[[Adoption]] is a permanent, legal transfer of parental rights and responsibilities from  child’s birth parents to the adoptive parents. Pregnant women looking to place their child up for adoption have many options as to how much involvement they wish to have in choosing the adoptive parents and to some degree. Nonetheless, birthmothers choosing to put their child up for adoption are legally terminating their parental rights to the child. Adoption laws differ state by state; adoption agencies, counselors, and lawyers can be used to provide information to the birth parents and adoptive parents about this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/pregnant-now-what/adoption|title=About Adoption {{!}} Placing Your Child for Adoption|website=www.plannedparenthood.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of adoption ===
There are two general types of adoption to choose from: [[closed adoption]], and [[open adoption]]. Closed adoptions are when the birthmother and adoptive parents have no contact with one another. In this case, the records of the biological parents are kept sealed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://family.findlaw.com/adoption/open-vs-closed-adoption.html|title=Open vs. Closed Adoption - FindLaw|work=Findlaw|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed adoptions are becoming less common within the United States but are still prevalent in international adoptions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Open adoptions occur when the biological mother and adoptive parents chose to keep in touch, though the amount and type of contact varies case by case, depending on what both parties agree on.

== Choosing to parent ==

=== Prenatal care ===
If a pregnant woman seeking pregnancy options counseling is considering completing her pregnancy, whether it be in the case of adoption or that she is choosing to parent, her next step would be to start [[prenatal care]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/pregnant-now-what|title=Pregnancy Options {{!}} What To Do If You're Pregnant|website=www.plannedparenthood.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prenatal care is a type of [[Preventive healthcare|preventative healthcare]] which serves to prevent potential health problems and promote a healthy lifestyle during the pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medlineplus.gov/prenatalcare.html|title=Prenatal Care {{!}} Prenatal Testing {{!}} MedlinePlus|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lifestyle changes ===
If a mother choses to parent her child, she should also expect to make some lifestyle changes to ensure the health and safety of her unborn child. The suggested lifestyle changes include stopping the consumption of caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, recreational drugs, and prescription drugs. The mother is also encouraged to have a healthy diet and excursive regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kidspot.co.nz/article+3344+116+Lifestyle-changes-during-pregnancy.htm|title=Lifestyle changes during pregnancy{{!}}First Trimester{{!}}Pregnancy - Kidspot New Zealand..|last=Australia|first=Kidspot New Zealand.. / Get Started|work=New Zealand|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11837">{{Spanish name|Brache|Ramírez}}
'''Rafael Ángel Brache Ramírez''' (July 8, 1888 – ?) was a politician, civil servant, and diplomat from the [[Dominican Republic]]. His career in national politics spanned from 1914 to 1935, after which he spent much of his life in exile.

Brache was born in [[Moca, Dominican Republic|Moca]], but lived in [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|La Vega]] from an early age and considered that to be his home town. He was elected to the [[Congress of the Dominican Republic|National Congress]] in 1914, aged 25, but resigned the following year to enter the diplomatic corps. Brache later worked as a senior civil servant for a period, and then [[Dominican Republic general election, 1924|in 1924]] returned to the National Congress. He supported [[Rafael Trujillo]]'s coup in 1930, and during the early years of his regime served as a diplomat and government minister. He was Ambassador to the United States from 1930 to 1931 and from 1934 to 1935, Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1931 to 1933, and Secretary of Finance from 1933 to 1934. He remained in the U.S. after being dismissed as ambassador, and in 1937 was declared a "traitor to the homeland" for his opposition to Trujillo.

==Early life==
Brache was born in [[Moca, Dominican Republic|Moca]] to María Apolonia Ramírez Melert and Elías Brache Soriano. His father, who was born in [[Santo Domingo]], was a music teacher and bandleader. Brache moved to [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|La Vega]] when he was a small child, and attended school there.&lt;ref name="hoy"&gt;— (July 26, 2013), [http://hoy.com.do/thomas-edward-perez-ancestros-dominicanos-en-el-gabinete-de-obama/ "Thomas Edward Pérez Ancestros dominicanos en el Gabinete de Obama"] {{Link language|es}}, ''Hoy''.

He resigned the following year to take up the position of Consul-General in London (the equivalent of ambassador), and had his [[Letter of credence|credentials]] received in February 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 29516|date=March 21, 1916|page=3064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his country's loss of sovereignty during the [[United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916–24)|American military occupation]], Brache served in London for only two years before being recalled.&lt;ref name="caribe"/&gt; He returned to the National Congress at the [[Dominican Republic general election, 1924|1924 general election]], as a representative of the [[Patriotic Coalition of Citizens]]. Brache was a director of the party's newspaper, ''El Siglo'' ("The Century"),&lt;ref name="hoy"/&gt; and also served for periods as Chief of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Director-General of Immigration, and as a delegate to the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]].&lt;ref name="bulletin"/&gt;

==Trujillo regime==
In March 1930, President [[Horacio Vásquez]] was overthrown in a coup led by [[Rafael Estrella Ureña]] and General [[Rafael Trujillo]]. Estrella Ureña succeeded Vásquez as provisional president, and with Trujillo worked out an arrangement whereby the pair would stand on the same ticket at the [[Dominican Republic general election, 1930|1930 presidential election]] (with Trujillo running for president and Estrella Ureña for vice-president).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Galíndez|first1=Jesús de|last2=Fitzgibbon|first2=Russell H.|date=1973|title=The Era of Trujillo|publisher=University of Arizona Press|pages=10–15|isbn=0816503931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brache, a supporter of the coup, reputedly clung to Trujillo "like a leech",&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;James V.

Retrieved March 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brache's first task as ambassador was to persuade the American government to endorse Trujillo's candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;Galíndez &amp; Fitzgibbon (1973), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 23, 1930, he met with [[Joseph P. Cotton]], the [[Under Secretary of State]].{{Efn|Cotton was acting in place of the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Henry L. Stimson]], who was overseas to negotiate the [[London Naval Treaty]].}} He told Cotton that Trujillo was a "very able man, a good organizer, very clever, intelligent and honest", and secured reluctant approval for the new regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ornes|first=Germán E.|date=1973|title=Trujillo: Little Caesar of the Caribbean|publisher=Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons|url=https://archive.org/stream/trujillolittleca013349mbp/trujillolittleca013349mbp_djvu.txt|pages=58–59|isbn= 1245549855}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report was immediately sent back to Santo Domingo, and the following day Trujillo gave a major speech in which he publicly announced his election manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Galíndez &amp; Fitzgibbon (1973), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the extent to which Brache was actually able to influence the U.S. government's position is uncertain. One contemporary commentator believed that Trujillo had made a deal with the Americans in the days after the coup, and suggested that Branche had effectively been sent on a fool's errand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roorda|first=Eric|date=1998|title=The Dictator Next Door: The Good Neighbor Policy and the Trujillo Regime in the Dominican Republic, 1930-1945|publisher=Duke University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cU3tio6nXe4C|pages=51–52|isbn=0822321238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brache was recalled from the United States in early 1931, apparently for failing to secure a loan from the American government. Later in the year, he was instead appointed Ambassador to the United Kingdom,{{efn|name=name}} taking up that post in December 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33779|date=December 11, 1931|page=7984}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also accredited as the non-resident ambassador to Denmark and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="hoy"/&gt; In 1933, Brache returned to Santo Domingo to become Finance Secretary.&lt;ref name="caribe"/&gt; He was re-appointed Ambassador to the United States in November 1934, presenting his credentials the following month.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; Brache's second term in Washington was largely devoted to improving Trujillo's public reputation, which had suffered due to reports of political assassinations and media suppression. He argued publicly and privately that the Dominican government was being unfair criticised, and praised Trujillo's personal accomplishments.&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt; In a 1935 address to the [[Pan-American Union]], he praised Trujillo's "firm love of peace" and "eloquence of deeds", and said he was deserving of "the gratitude of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 1935|title= DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND HAITI |url=https://archive.org/stream/bulletinofpaname6935pana/bulletinofpaname6935pana_djvu.txt|journal=Bulletin of the Pan-American Union|volume=LXIX|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Brache was dismissed as ambassador in November 1935, apparently due to rumours of involvement with some of Trujillo's exiled opponents. He was summoned back to the Dominican Republic to face a government tribunal, but chose to remain in the United States and eventually had his passport revoked. Brache resigned from the [[Dominican Party]] in March 1936, although his resignation was refused.&lt;ref name="nbc"&gt;Suzanne Gamboa (September 15, 2016).

==Legal outcome==
===Daughter===
Under the [[Youth Criminal Justice Act]], Jasmine's name could no longer be published in [[Canada]] after she became a suspect. Under the same act, twelve is the youngest possible age at which a person can be charged with a crime; convicts who were under fourteen years of age at the time they committed a crime cannot be sentenced as adults, and cannot be given more than a ten-year sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=29d18d62-f3bd-40be-a554-7b8eea81458d |title=If convicted, girl would be free in 10 years |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813110622/http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=29d18d62-f3bd-40be-a554-7b8eea81458d |archivedate=August 13, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 2007, Jasmine, who had by then turned 13, was found guilty of three counts of first-degree murder in the killings.&lt;ref name=cbc2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2007/07/09/med-hat.html|title=Medicine Hat girl guilty of first-degree murder|work=cbc.ca|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=July 9, 2007|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222112529/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2007/07/09/med-hat.html|archive-date=December 22, 2007|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is believed to be the youngest person ever convicted of a multiple murder in Canada.&lt;ref name=cbc2 /&gt;

On November 8, 2007, she was sentenced to the maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2007/11/08/girl-sentence.html|title=Teen gets maximum sentence for Medicine Hat killings|work=cbc.ca|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=November 8, 2007|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sentence included credit for eighteen months already spent in custody, to be followed by four years in a psychiatric institution and four-and-a-half years under conditional supervision in the community.

In September 2011, Jasmine began attending classes at [[Mount Royal University]] in Calgary, Alberta during the final years of her sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gather.com/viewArticlePF.action?articleId=281474980423951 Child Murderer Facing November Release]&lt;/ref&gt; She was released from a ten-year sentence at a psychiatric hospital in the fall of 2011, and in October 2012 it was reported her rehabilitation was going well, and she expressed remorse for her actions that experts considered genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicine Hat teen killer sentence reviewed|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/medicine-hat-teen-killer-sentence-reviewed-1.1262255|publisher=CBC News|date=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016 her sentence was completed, and she was freed of any further court-ordered conditions, restrictions or supervision after a final sentence review on May 6, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Labby|first=Bryan|title=J.R., who stabbed family to death with boyfriend at age 12, is free after 10-year sentence|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/jr-medicine-hat-murders-steinke-sentence-review-1.3568118|accessdate=May 6, 2016|publisher=CBC News|date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jeremy Steinke===
Steinke allegedly admitted to the murder of the parents in conversation with an undercover police officer while in custody. He was tried in November 2008 and found guilty by a jury on three counts of first-degree murder for the killings of the three Richardson victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steinke allegedly admitted to murder|url=http://calgary.ctvnews.ca/steinke-allegedly-admitted-to-murder-1.343878|publisher=CTVCalgary.ca|date=November 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 15, 2008, Steinke was sentenced to three life sentences, one for each first-degree murder count. The sentences are to be served concurrently, and Steinke will be eligible for parole after serving twenty-five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=67c05ce9-ef5b-491e-ae51-a705cef3b0e7|title=Steinke gets life in triple-murder|publisher=''[[Calgary Herald]]''|date=December 16, 2008|accessdate=July 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kacy Lancaster===
The accessory to murder charge against the couple's friend Kacy Lancaster was dropped, and she pleaded guilty to an obstruction charge in Medicine Hat provincial court. She received one year house arrest as part of the plea bargain, and was ordered to refrain from drugs and alcohol.

'''''Dollart''''' was a {{GRT|535|link=off}} [[coastal trading vessel|coaster]] that was built in 1912 by [[Stettiner Oderwerke]] [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]], [[Stettin]], [[Germany]] for German owners. She was seized by the Allies in May 1945, passed to the [[Ministry of War Transport]] (MoWT) and was renamed '''''Empire Constancy'''''. In 1947, she was sold into merchant service and renamed '''''Polzeath'''''. In 1951, she was sold to [[Turkey]] and renamed '''''Meltem'''''. Further sales saw her renamed '''''Yener 9''''' in 1956 and '''''Yarasli''''' in 1959. She went missing in the [[Ionian Sea]] in January 1961.

==Description==
The ship was built in 1912 by [[Stettiner Oderwerke]], [[Stettin]].&lt;ref name=Ships&gt;{{cite book |last1= Mitchell |first1=W.H. |last2=Sawyer |first2=L.A. |year=1995 |title=The Empire Ships |page=not cited |publisher= Lloyd's of London Press Ltd |location= London, New York, Hamburg, Hong Kong |isbn=1-85044-275-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was {{convert|165|ft|8|in|m|2}} long, with a beam of {{convert|28|ft|6|in|m|2}} and a depth of {{convert|11|ft|5|in|m|2}}. The ship had a GRT of 535 and a NRT of 268.&lt;ref name=Dollart30&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=30b0332.pdf|title=LLOYD'S REGISTER, NAVIRES A VAPEUR ET A MOTEURS |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- She had a DWT of x,xxx.--&gt;

The ship was propelled by a [[compound steam engine]] which had one cylinder of {{convert|17+3/16|in|cm}} and one cylinder of {{convert|31+1/2|in|cm}} diameter by {{convert|21+3/4|in|cm}} stroke. The engine was built by Stettiner Oderwerke.&lt;ref name=Dollart30/&gt;&lt;!-- It could propel the ship at {{convert|xx|kn|km/h}}.--&gt;

==History==
''Dollart'' was built for Bugsier Reederei und Bergungs AG, [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name=Ships/&gt; Her port of registry was Hamburg, the [[Code Letters]] RSMN were allocated.&lt;ref name=Dollart33/&gt; On 1 May 1914, ''Dollart'' struck the wreck of {{SS|Werner||}} in the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] at [[Glückstadt]] and sank with the loss of two crew.&lt;ref name=Times040514&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Marine Insurance Market |day_of_week=Monday |date=4 May 1914 |page_number=23 |issue=40514 |column=G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1919, ''Dollart'' transported a cargo of food and clothing from Germany to [[Scapa Flow]], [[Orkney Islands]] to supply the crews of ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' crews interned there.&lt;ref name=Times041219&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Plans for Scapa Scuttling.

In May 1945, ''Dollart'' was seized by the Allies at [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. She was passed to the MoWT and renamed ''Empire Constancy''.&lt;ref name=Ships/&gt; Her port of registry was changed to [[London]] and she was placed under the management of Rose Line Ltd. The Code Letters GFXT and United Kingdom Official Number 180639 were allocatd.&lt;ref name=Constancy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=45a1186.pdf |title=LLOYD'S REGISTER, STEAMERS &amp; MOTORSHIPS |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, ''Empire Constancy'' was sold to S Hannan &amp; Co Ltd, [[Polzeath]] and was renamed ''Polzeath''.&lt;ref name=Ships/&gt;

In 1951, ''Polzeath'' was sold to Azize Arkan v. Ortaklari, [[Turkey]] and was renamed ''Meltem''. In 1956, she was sold to Erpak Vap Ithalkat Ihracat, Turkey and was renamed ''Yener 9''. In 1959, she was sold to Zeki v Ziya Son Izzet Kirtil, Turkey and was renamed ''Yarasli''. On 14 January 1961, ''Yarasli'' sailed from [[Istanbul]] bound for [[Bagnoli]], [[Italy]]. On 25 January, she reported passing [[Kefalonia]], [[Greece]]. Nothing further was heard of her and it is presumed she foundered in the [[Ionian Sea]].&lt;ref name=Ships/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1442">A '''self-making bed''' (also known as ''smart bed'') is designed to automatically rearrange the [[bedding]] on a bed and prepare itself for use.

In 2008, inventor Enrico Berruti featured his self-making bed, dubbed "Selfy", at The International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland. The bed makes itself by stretching and smoothing the sheets over the mattress by using metal rails that connect to the bed sheets alongside the bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engeler|first=Eliane|title=World's biggest inventions fair features self-making bed|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/conventions/2008-04-02-inventions-fair_N.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smart Duvet uses fabric to make the bed through a network of air chambers. This is a breathable layer that is made of lightweight material. When activated it inflates the sheet's air chamber, placing the duvet and sheets back in position. Using an app, the user can preset a different bed-making time for each day of the week. It does not replace the existing bed and is non permanent so it can be used with existing duvet and duvet coverbedding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/smartduvet-self-making-bed-youve-waiting/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2016/11/30/smartduvet-self-making-bed-truly-lazy-piece-shit-life/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Sexual assault]] of [[LGBT]] persons''' is a form of violence that occurs within the LGBT community. While sexual assault and other forms of interpersonal violence can occur in all forms of relationships, it is found that sexual minorities experience it at rates that are equal to or higher than their heterosexual counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_victimization_final-a.pdf|title=NISVS: An Overview of 2010 Findings on Victimization by Sexual Orientation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of research on this specific problem for the LGBT population as a whole, but there does exist a substantial amount of research on college LGBT students who have experienced sexual assault. 

== Definition ==
There are varying definitions as to what sexual assault is defined as. According to the [[United States Department of Justice]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The term 'sexual assault' means any nonconsensual sexual act proscribed by Federal, tribal, or State law, including when the victim lacks capacity to consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault|title=Sexual Assault {{!}} OVW {{!}} Department of Justice|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Definitions and laws of sexual assault vary from state to state. The website [https://statelaws.findlaw.com/criminal-laws/sexual-assault.html FindLaw] allows users to click on their corresponding to state to read about how their state defines what sexual assault is, as well as what laws and limitations exist. Sexual assault of LGBT individuals refers to the act of sexual violence against persons who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender amongst other sexualities and sexual minorities. 

== Statistics ==
The [[Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network]], also known as RAINN, puts out general statistics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence|title=Victims of Sexual Violence: Statistics {{!}} RAINN|website=www.rainn.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; of sexual assault, including:

* Every 98 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted.
* 21% of TGQN (transgender, genderqueer, nonconforming) college students have been sexually assaulted.

According to a 2010 findings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_victimization_final-a.pdf|title=NISVS: An Overview of 2010 Findings on Victimization by Sexual Orientation|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_victimization_final-a.pdf The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey], put out by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], it concluded that:

* For Lesbian women: 
** 44% experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
** Approximately 1 in 8 (13%) have been raped in their lifetime.
* For Gay men:
** 26% experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
** 4 in 10 (40%) have experienced sexual violence other than rape in their lifetime.
* Bisexual Women:
** 61% experienced rap, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner at some point in their lifetime.
** 1 in 5 (22%) have been raped by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
** 46% have been raped in their lifetime.
* Bisexual Men:
** 37% experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
** 47% have experienced sexual violence other than rape in their lifetime.

In a paper done by Emily Rothman, Deinera Exner, and Allyson Baughman, it was found that, in regard to lifetime sexual assault victimization, the estimated prevalence for lesbian and bisexual women was approximately 12.6 - 85%. For gay and bisexual men, it was 11.8-54.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothman|first=Emily F.|last2=Exner|first2=Deinera|last3=Baughman|first3=Allyson | date = April 2011 |title=The prevalence of sexual assault against people who identify as Gay, Lesbian or Bisexual in the United States: A systematic review |journal=Trauma, violence &amp; abuse|volume=12|issue=2|pages=55–66|doi=10.1177/1524838010390707 |pmc=3118668|pmid=21247983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying issues, myths, and misconceptions ==
{{or-section|date=May 2018}}
The underlying issues of sexual assault against LGBT persons includes homophobia and transphobia among other forms of prejudice against sexual minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcar.org/about-sexual-violence/lgbtq|title=LGBTQ {{!}} Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape (PCAR)|website=www.pcar.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forms of prejudice end up creating unsafe spaces for LGBT persons where they do not feel comfortable expressing themselves or do not feel safe living as their authentic self. 

According to the [https://prideresourcecenter.colostate.edu/ Pride Resource Center] at Colorado State University, homophobia is defined as:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Homophobia is a pervasive, irrational fear of homosexuality. Homophobia includes the fear heterosexuals have of any homosexual feelings within themselves, any overt mannerisms or actions that would suggest homosexuality, and the resulting desire to suppress or stamp out homosexuality. And it also includes the self-hatred and self-denial of homosexuals who know what they are but have been taught all their lives by a heterosexual society that people like themselves are sick, sinful and criminal.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prideresourcecenter.colostate.edu/resources/homophobia/|title=Homophobia {{!}} Pride Resource Center|website=prideresourcecenter.colostate.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to [[Planned Parenthood]], transphobia is defined as:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Transphobia is the fear, hatred, disbelief, or mistrust of people who are transgender, thought to be transgender, or whose gender expression doesn’t conform to traditional gender roles. Transphobia can prevent transgender and gender nonconforming people from living full lives free from harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sexual-orientation-gender/trans-and-gender-nonconforming-identities/whats-transphobia|title=What's Transphobia? {{!}} Facts About Transphobic Discrimination|website=www.plannedparenthood.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;These phobias, as well as myths centered around LGBT individuals, influence a culture that holds back persons from identifying how they choose and places them into a binary that doesn't encompass all possible ways of identifying. One of the main myths that can harm LGBT individuals is the idea that they have not met the right guy/girl yet. This perpetuates heterosexism and denies the possibility of one having attraction to the same gender. 

One of the biggest misconceptions that comes out of transphobia centers around the use of bathrooms. Made popular by North Carolina's "[[Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act|Bathroom Bill]]", it brought up the concern that by allowing individuals to use the bathroom that corresponds to the gender they identify as, predators could easily enter bathrooms and take advantage of individuals claiming that they identify as the gender the bathroom is. Legislation, such as House Bill 2, only perpetuate the discrimination of transgender individuals, rather than give them support to live their lives as the gender by which they identify. Laws have always existed that prohibit individuals from entering bathrooms with the purpose of harming others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.glaad.org/sites/default/files/Debunking_the_Bathroom_Bill_Myth_2017.pdf|title=Debunking the "Bathroom Bill" Myth|last=|first=|date=|work=GLAAD Transgender Media Program|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Suicide sidebar}}
A '''suicide note''' or '''death note''' is a message left behind before a person dies, or intends to die, by  [[suicide]].

It is estimated that 25–30% of suicides are accompanied by a note. However, incidence rates may depend on ethnicity, race and cultural differences, and may reach rates as high as 50% in certain demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=SHIOIRI|first1=TOSHIKI|last2=NISHIMURA|first2=AKIYOSHI|last3=AKAZAWA|first3=KOHEI|last4=ABE|first4=RYO|last5=NUSHIDA|first5=HIDEYUKI|last6=UENO|first6=YASUHIRO|last7=KOJIKA-MARUYAMA|first7=MAKI|last8=SOMEYA|first8=TOSHIYUKI|title=Incidence of note-leaving remains constant despite increasing suicide rates|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|date=April 2005|volume=59|issue=2|pages=226–228|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2005.01364.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1440-1819.2005.01364.x/abstract;jsessionid=7EEE43FC6174536D1E6D6071AE34826F.f04t03|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content can be a plea for absolution or blaming family, friends or society for life's failings.  A suicide message can be a written note, an audio message, or a video.

==Reasons==
Some fields of study, such as [[sociology]], [[psychiatry]] and [[graphology]], have investigated the reasons why people who die by, or attempt, suicide leave a note.

According to Lenora Olsen, the most common reasons that people contemplating suicide choose to write a suicide note include one or more of the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis
|last=Olsen|first=Lenora|title=The Use of Suicide Notes as an Aid for Understanding Motive in Completed Suicides|publisher=University of Utah|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To ease the pain of those known to the victim by attempting to dissipate guilt.
* To increase the pain of survivors by attempting to create guilt.
* To set out the reason(s) for suicide.
* To express thoughts and feelings that the person felt unable to express in life.
* To give instructions for disposal of the remains.
* Occasionally, to confess acts of murder or some other offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/14/newsid_2503000/2503395.stm|title=Suicide note reveals murder confession|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-10-28 | date=1971-07-14 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lincolnshire/4762774.stm|title=Man jailed for murder in lay-by |date=2008-03-01|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-10-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2000/06/23/note000623.html|title=Suicide note found in murder-suicide case|date=2000-06-23|publisher=cbc.ca|accessdate=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes there is also a message in the case of [[murder–suicide]], explaining the reason(s) for the murder(s), see for example, [[Marc Lépine#Lépine's suicide statement|Marc Lépine's suicide statement]] and [[7 July 2005 London bombings#Videotaped statements|videotaped statements of the 7 July 2005 London bombers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42591">'''Survival analysis''' is a branch of [[statistics]] for analyzing the expected duration of time until one or more events happen, such as death in biological organisms and failure in mechanical systems. This topic is called '''[[reliability theory]]''' or '''reliability analysis''' in [[engineering]], '''duration analysis''' or '''duration modelling''' in [[economics]], and '''event history analysis''' in [[sociology]]. Survival analysis attempts to answer questions such as: what is the proportion of a population which will survive past a certain time? Of those that survive, at what rate will they die or fail? Can multiple causes of death or failure be taken into account? How do particular circumstances or characteristics increase or decrease the probability of survival?

To answer such questions, it is necessary to define "lifetime". In the case of biological survival, [[death]] is unambiguous, but for mechanical reliability, [[failure]] may not be well-defined, for there may well be mechanical systems in which failure is partial, a matter of degree, or not otherwise localized in [[time]]. Even in biological problems, some events (for example, [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] or other organ failure) may have the same ambiguity. The [[theory]] outlined below assumes well-defined events at specific times; other cases may be better treated by models which explicitly account for ambiguous events.

More generally, survival analysis involves the modelling of time to event data; in this context, death or failure is considered an "event" in the survival analysis literature – traditionally only a single event occurs for each subject, after which the organism or mechanism is dead or broken.  ''Recurring event'' or ''repeated event'' models relax that assumption. The study of recurring events is relevant in [[systems reliability]], and in many areas of social sciences and medical research.

==Introduction to survival analysis==

Survival analysis is used in several ways:

*To describe the survival times of members of a group 
**[[Life table]]s 
**[[Kaplan–Meier estimator|Kaplan-Meier curves]]
**[[Survival function]]
**[[Failure rate|Hazard function]]
*To compare the survival times of two or more groups 
**[[Log-rank test]]
*To describe the effect of categorical or quantitative variables on survival
**[[Proportional hazards model|Cox proportional hazards regression]]
**Parametric survival models
**Survival trees 
**Survival random forests

===Definitions of common terms in survival analysis===

The following terms are commonly used in survival analyses:

*Event: Death, disease occurrence, disease recurrence, recovery, or other experience of interest
*Time: The time from the beginning of an observation period (such as surgery or beginning treatment) to (i) an event, or (ii) end of the study, or (iii) loss of contact or withdrawal from the study.
*Censoring / Censored observation: If a subject does not have an event during the observation time, they are described as censored. The subject is censored in the sense that nothing is observed or known about that subject after the time of censoring.  A censored subject may or may not have an event after the end of observation time.
*[[Survival function]] S(t): The probability that a subject survives longer than time t.

===Example: Acute myelogenous leukemia survival data===

This example uses the [[Acute myeloid leukemia|Acute Myelogenous Leukemia]] survival data set "aml" from the "survival" package in R. The data set is from Miller (1997)&lt;ref name="Miller1997"&gt;{{Citation
|last1= Miller
|first1= Rupert G.
|title= Survival analysis
|year=1997
|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons
|isbn=0-471-25218-2
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the question is whether the standard course of chemotherapy should be extended ('maintained') for additional cycles.

The aml data set sorted by survival time is shown in the box.

[[File:Aml data set sorted by survival time.png|thumb|320px|aml data set sorted by survival time]]

* Time is indicated by the variable "time", which is the survival or censoring time
* Event (recurrence of aml cancer) is indicated by the variable "status". 0 = no event (censored), 1 = event (recurrence)
* Treatment group: the variable "x" indicates if maintenance chemotherapy was given

The last observation (11), at 161 weeks, is censored. Censoring indicates that the patient did not have an event (no recurrence of aml cancer). Another subject, observation 3, was censored at 13 weeks (indicated by status=0). This subject was only in the study for 13 weeks, and the aml cancer did not recur during those 13 weeks. It is possible that this patient was enrolled near the end of the study, so that they could only be observed for 13 weeks. It is also possible that the patient was enrolled early in the study, but was lost to follow up or withdrew from the study. The table shows that other subjects were censored at 16, 28, and 45 weeks (observations 17, 6, and 9 with status=0). The remaining subjects all experienced events (recurrence of aml cancer) while in the study. The question of interest is whether recurrence occurs later in maintained patients than in non-maintained patients.

====Kaplan-Meier plot for the aml data====

The [[Survival function]] S(t), is the probability that a subject survives longer than time t. S(t) is theoretically a smooth curve, but it is usually estimated using the [[Kaplan–Meier estimator|Kaplan-Meier]] (KM) curve. The graph shows the KM plot for the aml data and can be interpreted as follows:

*The x axis is time, from zero (when observation began) to the last observed time point.
*The y axis is the proportion of subjects surviving. At time zero, 100% of the subjects are alive without an event.
*The solid line (similar to a staircase) shows the progression of event occurrences.
*A vertical drop indicates an event. In the aml table shown above, two subjects had events at 5 weeks, two had events at 8 weeks, one had an event at 9 weeks, and so on. These events at 5 weeks, 8 weeks and so on are indicated by the vertical drops in the KM plot at those time points.
*At the far right end of the KM plot there is a tick mark at 161 weeks. The vertical tick mark indicates that a patient was censored at this time. In the aml data table five subjects were censored, at 13, 16, 28, 45 and 161 weeks. There are five tick marks in the KM plot, corresponding to these censored observations.

==== Life table for the aml data====

A [[life table]] summarizes survival data in terms of the number of events and the proportion surviving at each event time point. The life table for the aml data, created using the R software, is shown.

[[File:Life table for the aml data.png|thumb|500px|Life table for the aml data]]

The life table summarizes the events and the proportion surviving at each event time point. The columns in the life table have the following interpretation:

*time gives the time points at which events occur.
*n.risk is the number of subjects at risk immediately before the time point, t. Being "at risk" means that the subject has not had an event before time t, and is not censored before or at time t.
*n.event is the number of subjects who have events at time t.
*survival is the proportion surviving, as determined using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimate.
*std.err is the standard error of the estimated survival. The standard error of the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimate it is calculated using Greenwood’s formula, and depends on the number at risk (n.risk in the table), the number of deaths (n.event in the table) and the proportion surviving (survival in the table).
*lower 95% CI and upper 95% CI are the lower and upper 95% confidence bounds for the proportion surviving.

====[[Log-rank test]]: Testing for differences in survival in the aml data====

The log-rank test compares the survival times of two or more groups. This example uses a log-rank test for a difference in survival in the maintained versus non-maintained treatment groups in the aml data. The graph shows KM plots for the aml data broken out by treatment group, which is indicated by the variable "x" in the data.

[[File:Kaplan-Meier by treatment in AML.svg|thumb|320px|Kaplan-Meier graph by treatment group in aml]]

The null hypothesis for a log-rank test is that the groups have the same survival. The expected number of subjects surviving at each time point in each is adjusted for the number of subjects at risk in the groups at each event time. The log-rank test determines if the observed number of events in each group is significantly different from the expected number. The formal test is based on a chi-squared statistic. When the log-rank statistic is large, it is evidence for a difference in the survival times between the groups. The log-rank statistic approximately has a [[chi-squared distribution]] with one degree of freedom, and the p-value is calculated using the chi-squared distribution.

For the example data, the log-rank test for difference in survival gives a p-value of p=0.0653, indicating that the treatment groups do not differ significantly in survival, assuming an alpha level of 0.05. The sample size of 23 subjects is modest, so there is little power to detect differences between the treatment groups. The chi-squared test is based on asymptotic approximation, so the p-value should be regarded with caution for small sample sizes.

===[[Proportional hazards model|Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression analysis]]===

Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests are most useful when the predictor variable is categorical (e.g., drug vs. placebo), or takes a small number of values (e.g., drug doses 0, 20, 50, and 100&amp;nbsp;mg/day) that can be treated as categorical. The log-rank test and KM curves don’t work easily with quantitative predictors such as gene expression, white blood count, or age. For quantitative predictor variables, an alternative method is [[Survival analysis#Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression analysis|Cox proportional hazards regression]] analysis. Cox PH models work also with categorical predictor variables, which are encoded as {0,1}  indicator or dummy variables. The log-rank test is a special case of a Cox PH analysis, and can be performed using Cox PH software.

====Example: Cox proportional hazards regression analysis for melanoma====

This example uses the melanoma data set from Dalgaard Chapter 12.

Data are in the R package ISwR. The Cox proportional hazards regression using R gives the results shown in the box.
	
 [[File:Cox proportional hazards regression output for melanoma data set.png|thumb|400px|right|Cox proportional hazards regression output for melanoma data. Predictor variable is sex 1: female, 2: male.]]

The Cox regression results are interpreted as follows.

*Sex is encoded as a numeric vector (1: female, 2: male). The R summary for the Cox model gives the hazard ratio (HR) for the second group relative to the first group, that is, male versus female.
*coef = 0.662 is the estimated logarithm of the hazard ratio for males versus females.
*exp(coef) = 1.94 = exp(0.662) - The log of the hazard ratio (coef= 0.662) is transformed to the hazard ratio using exp(coef). The summary for the Cox model gives the hazard ratio for the second group relative to the first group, that is, male versus female. The estimated hazard ratio of 1.94 indicates that males have higher risk of death (lower survival rates) than females, in these data.
*se(coef) = 0.265 is the standard error of the log hazard ratio.
*z = 2.5 = coef/se(coef) = 0.662/0.265. Dividing the coef by its standard error gives the z score.
*p=0.013. The p-value corresponding to z=2.5 for sex is p=0.013, indicating that there is a significant difference in survival as a function of sex.

The summary output also gives upper and lower 95% confidence intervals for the hazard ratio: lower 95% bound = 1.15; upper 95% bound = 3.26.

Finally, the output gives p-values for three alternative tests for overall significance of the model:

*Likelihood ratio test = 6.15  on 1 df,   p=0.0131
*Wald test = 6.24  on 1 df,   p=0.0125
*Score (log-rank) test = 6.47  on 1 df,   p=0.0110

These three methods are asymptotically equivalent. For large enough N, they will give similar results. For small N, they may differ somewhat. The last row, "Score (logrank) test" is the result for the log-rank test, with p=0.011, the same result as the log-rank test, because the log-rank test is a special case of a Cox PH regression. The Likelihood ratio test has better behavior for small sample sizes, so it is generally preferred.

====Cox model using a covariate in the melanoma data====

The Cox model extends the log-rank test by allowing the inclusion of additional covariates. This example use the melanom data set where the predictor variables include a continuous covariate, the thickness of the tumor (variable name = “thick”).

[[File:Histograms of melanoma thickness.png|thumb|700px|Histograms of melanoma tumor thickness]]

In the histograms, the thickness values don’t look normally distributed. Regression models, including the Cox model, generally give more reliable results with normally-distributed variables. For this example use a log transform. The log of the thickness of the tumor looks to be more normally distributed, so the Cox models will use log thickness. The Cox PH analysis gives the results in the box.

[[File:Cox PH output for melanoma with thickness.png|thumb|500px|Cox PH output for melanoma data set with covariate log tumor thickness]]

The p-value for all three overall tests (likelihood, Wald, and score) are significant, indicating that the model is significant. The p-value for log(thick) is 6.9e-07, with a hazard ratio HR = exp(coef) = 2.18, indicating a strong relationship between the thickness of the tumor and increased risk of death.

By contrast, the p-value for sex is now p=0.088. The hazard ratio HR = exp(coef) = 1.58, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.934 to 2.68. Because the confidence interval for HR includes 1, these results indicate that sex makes a smaller contribution to the difference in the HR after controlling for the thickness of the tumor, and only trend toward significance. Examination of graphs of log(thickness) by sex and a t-test of log(thickness) by sex both indicate that there is a significant difference between men and women in the thickness of the tumor when they first see the clinician.

The Cox model assumes that the hazards are proportional. The proportional hazard assumption may be tested using the R function cox.zph(). A p-value is less than 0.05 indicates that the hazards are not proportional. For the melanoma data, p=0.222, indicating that the hazards are, at least approximately, proportional. Additional tests and graphs for examining a Cox model are described in the textbooks cited.

====Extensions to Cox models====

Cox models can be extended to deal with variations on the simple analysis. 
	
*Stratification. The subjects can be divided into strata, where subjects within a stratum are expected to be relatively more similar to each other than to randomly chosen subjects from other strata. The regression parameters are assumed to be the same across the strata, but a different baseline hazard may exist for each stratum. Stratification is useful for analyses using matched subjects, for dealing with patient subsets, such as different clinics, and for dealing with violations of the proportional hazard assumption.
*Time-varying covariates. Some variables, such as gender and treatment group, generally stay the same in a clinical trial. Other clinical variables, such as serum protein levels or dose of concomitant medications may change over the course of a study. Cox models may be extended for such time-varying covariates.

===Tree-structured survival models===

The Cox PH regression model is a linear model. It is similar to linear regression and logistic regression. Specifically, these methods assume that a single line, curve, plane, or surface is sufficient to separate groups (alive, dead) or to estimate a quantitative response (survival time).

In some cases alternative partitions give more accurate classification or quantitative estimates. One set of alternative methods are tree-structured survival models, including survival random forests. Tree-structured survival models may give more accurate predictions than Cox models. Examining both types of models for a given data set is a reasonable strategy.

====Example survival tree analysis====

This example of a survival tree analysis uses the R package "rpart". The example is based on 146 stage C prostate cancer patients in the data set stagec in rpart. Rpart and the stagec example are described in the PDF document "An Introduction to Recursive Partitioning Using the RPART Routines". Terry M. Therneau, Elizabeth J. Atkinson, Mayo Foundation. September 3, 1997.

The variables in stagec are:
*pgtime time to progression, or last follow-up free of progression
*pgstat status at last follow-up (1=progressed, 0=censored)
*age age at diagnosis
*eet early endocrine therapy (1=no, 0=yes)
*ploidy diploid/tetraploid/aneuploid DNA pattern
*g2 % of cells in G2 phase
*grade tumor grade (1-4)
*gleason Gleason grade (3-10)

The survival tree produced by the analysis is shown in the figure.

[[File:Survival tree for prostate cancer.png|thumb|700px|Survival tree for prostate cancer data set]]

Each branch in the tree indicates a split on the value of a variable. For example, the root of the tree splits subjects with grade &lt; 2.5 versus subjects with grade 2.5 or greater. The terminal nodes indicate the number of subjects in the node, the number of subjects who have events, and the relative event rate compared to the root. In the node on the far left, the values 1/33 indicate that 1 of the 33 subjects in the node had an event, and that the relative event rate is 0.122. In the node on the far right bottom, the values 11/15 indicate that 11 of 15 subjects in the node had an event, and the relative event rate is 2.7.

==== Survival random forests====

An alternative to building a single survival tree is to build many survival trees, where each tree is constructed using a sample of the data, and average the trees to predict survival. This is the method underlying the survival random forest models. Survival random forest analysis is available in the R package "randomForestSRC".

The randomForestSRC package includes an example survival random forest analysis using the data set pbc. This data is from the Mayo Clinic Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) trial of the liver conducted between 1974 and 1984. In the example, the random forest survival model gives more accurate predictions of survival than the Cox PH model. The prediction errors are estimated by [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap re-sampling]].

==General formulation==

===Survival function===
{{main|Survival function}}
The object of primary interest is the '''survival function''', conventionally denoted ''S'', which is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;S(t) = \Pr(T &gt; t)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is some time, ''T'' is a [[random variable]] denoting the time of death, and "Pr" stands for [[probability]]. That is, the survival function is the probability that the time of death is later than some specified time ''t''.
The survival function is also called the ''survivor function'' or ''survivorship function'' in problems of biological survival, and the ''reliability function'' in mechanical survival problems. In the latter case, the reliability function is denoted ''R''(''t'').

Usually one assumes ''S''(0) = 1, although it could be less than 1 if there is the possibility of immediate death or failure.

The survival function must be non-increasing: ''S''(''u'') ≤ ''S''(''t'') if ''u'' ≥ ''t''. This property follows directly because ''T''&gt;''u'' implies ''T''&gt;''t''. This reflects the notion that survival to a later age is only possible if all younger ages are attained. Given this property, the lifetime distribution function and event density (''F'' and ''f'' below) are well-defined.

The survival function is usually assumed to approach zero as age increases without bound, i.e., ''S''(''t'') → 0 as ''t'' → ∞, although the limit could be greater than zero if eternal life is possible. For instance, we could apply survival analysis to a mixture of stable and unstable [[Carbon#Isotopes|carbon isotopes]]; unstable isotopes would decay sooner or later, but the stable isotopes would last indefinitely.

===Lifetime distribution function and event density===

Related quantities are defined in terms of the survival function.

The '''lifetime distribution function''', conventionally denoted ''F'', is defined as the complement of the survival function,

:&lt;math&gt;F(t) = \Pr(T \le t) = 1 - S(t).&lt;/math&gt;

If ''F'' is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] then the derivative, which is the density function of the lifetime distribution, is conventionally denoted ''f'',

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = F'(t) = \frac{d}{dt} F(t).&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''f'' is sometimes called the '''event density'''; it is the rate of death or failure events per unit time.

The survival function can be expressed in terms of [[probability distribution]] and [[probability density function]]s

:&lt;math&gt;S(t) = \Pr(T &gt; t) = \int_t^{\infty} f(u)\,du = 1-F(t).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, a survival event density function can be defined as

:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = S'(t) = \frac{d}{dt} S(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \int_t^{\infty} f(u)\,du = \frac{d}{dt} [1-F(t)] = -f(t).&lt;/math&gt;

In other fields, such as statistical physics, the survival event density function is known as the [[first passage time]] density.

===Hazard function and cumulative hazard function===

The '''[[hazard function]]''', conventionally denoted &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as the event rate at time ''t'' conditional on survival until time ''t'' or later (that is, ''T'' ≥ ''t''). Suppose that an item has survived for a time t and we desire the probability that it will not survive for an additional time ''dt'':

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(t) = \lim_{dt \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Pr(t \leq T &lt; t+dt)}{dt\cdot S(t)} = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)} = - \frac{S'(t)}{S(t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Force of mortality]] is a synonym of ''hazard function'' which is used particularly in [[demography]] and [[actuarial science]], where it is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;. The term ''hazard rate'' is another synonym.

The force of mortality of the survival function  is defined as  &lt;math&gt;\mu(x)=-{d \over dx}\ln(S(x))=\frac{f(x)}{S(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

The force of mortality is also called the force of failure. It is the probability density function of the distribution of mortality.

In actuarial science, the hazard rate is the rate of death for lives aged x. For a life aged x, the force of mortality t years later is the force of mortality for a (x + t)–year old. The hazard rate is also called the failure rate. Hazard rate and failure rate are names used in reliability theory.

Any function ''h''  is a hazard function if and only if it satisfies the following properties:

#&lt;math&gt;\forall x\geq0\left(h(x)\geq0\right)&lt;/math&gt; ,
#&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\infty} h(x)dx=\infty&lt;/math&gt; .

In fact, the hazard rate is usually more informative about the underlying mechanism of failure than the other representatives of a lifetime distribution.

The hazard function must be non-negative, λ(''t'') ≥ 0, and its integral over &lt;math&gt;[0, \infty]&lt;/math&gt; must be infinite, but is not otherwise constrained; it may be increasing or decreasing, non-monotonic, or discontinuous.
An example is the [[bathtub curve]] hazard function, which is large for small values of ''t'', decreasing to some minimum, and thereafter increasing again; this can model the property of some mechanical systems to either fail soon after operation, or much later, as the system ages.

The hazard function can alternatively be represented in terms of the '''cumulative hazard function''', conventionally denoted &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\,\Lambda(t) = -\log S(t)&lt;/math&gt;

so transposing signs and exponentiating

:&lt;math&gt;\,S(t) = \exp(-\Lambda(t))&lt;/math&gt;

or differentiating (with the chain rule)

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \Lambda(t) = -\frac{S'(t)}{S(t)} = \lambda(t).&lt;/math&gt;

The name "cumulative hazard function" is derived from the fact that

:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda(t) = \int_0^{t} \lambda(u)\,du&lt;/math&gt;

which is the "accumulation" of the hazard over time.

From the definition of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt;, we see that it increases without bound as ''t'' tends to infinity (assuming that ''S''(''t'') tends to zero). This implies that &lt;math&gt;\lambda(t)&lt;/math&gt; must not decrease too quickly, since, by definition, the cumulative hazard has to diverge. For example, &lt;math&gt;\exp(-t)&lt;/math&gt; is not the hazard function of any survival distribution, because its integral converges to 1.

The survival function ''S''(''t''), the cumulative hazard function Λ(''t''), the density ''f''(''t''), and the hazard function λ(''t'') are related through
:&lt;math&gt;S(t) = \exp [ -\Lambda(t) ] = \frac{f(t)}{\lambda(t)}, \quad t &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Quantities derived from the survival distribution===

'''Future lifetime''' at a given time &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the time remaining until death, given survival to age &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, it is &lt;math&gt;T - t_0&lt;/math&gt; in the present notation. The '''expected future lifetime''' is the [[expected value]] of future lifetime. The probability of death at or before age &lt;math&gt;t_0+t&lt;/math&gt;, given survival until age &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt;, is just

:&lt;math&gt;P(T \le t_0 + t \mid T &gt; t_0) = \frac{P(t_0 &lt; T \le t_0 + t)}{P(T &gt; t_0)} = \frac{F(t_0 + t) - F(t_0)}{S(t_0)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the probability density of future lifetime is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{F(t_0 + t) - F(t_0)}{S(t_0)} = \frac{f(t_0 + t)}{S(t_0)}&lt;/math&gt;

and the expected future lifetime is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{S(t_0)} \int_0^{\infty} t\,f(t_0+t)\,dt = \frac{1}{S(t_0)} \int_{t_0}^{\infty} S(t)\,dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where the second expression is obtained using [[integration by parts]].

For &lt;math&gt;t_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, that is, at birth, this reduces to the expected lifetime.

In reliability problems, the expected lifetime is called the ''[[mean time to failure]]'', and the expected future lifetime is called the ''mean residual lifetime''.

As the probability of an individual surviving until age ''t'' or later is ''S''(''t''), by definition, the expected number of survivors at age ''t'' out of an initial [[population]] of ''n'' newborns is ''n'' × ''S''(''t''), assuming the same survival function for all individuals. Thus the expected proportion of survivors is ''S''(''t'').
If the survival of different individuals is independent, the number of survivors at age ''t'' has a [[binomial distribution]] with parameters ''n'' and ''S''(''t''), and the [[variance]] of the proportion of survivors is ''S''(''t'') ×  (1-''S''(''t''))/''n''.

The age at which a specified proportion of survivors remain can be found by solving the equation ''S''(''t'') = ''q'' for ''t'', where ''q'' is the [[quantile]] in question. Typically one is interested in the '''[[median]] lifetime''', for which ''q'' = 1/2, or other quantiles such as ''q'' = 0.90 or ''q'' = 0.99.

One can also make more complex inferences from the survival distribution. In mechanical reliability problems, one can bring cost (or, more generally, [[utility]]) into consideration, and thus solve problems concerning repair or replacement. This leads to the study of [[renewal theory]] and [[reliability theory of ageing and longevity]].

==Censoring==
[[Censoring (statistics)|Censoring]] is a form of missing data problem in which time to event is not observed for reasons such as termination of study before all recruited subjects have shown the event of interest or the subject has left the study prior to experiencing an event. Censoring is common in survival analysis.

If only the lower limit ''l'' for the true event time ''T'' is known such that ''T'' &gt; ''l'', this is called ''right censoring''. Right censoring  will occur, for example, for those subjects whose birth date is known but who are still alive when they are [[lost to follow-up]] or when the study ends. We generally encounter right-censored data.

If the event of interest has already happened before the subject is included in the study but it is not known when it occurred, the data is said to be ''left-censored''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Censoring, Left and Right |title=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences |editor-first=William A., Jr. |editor-last=Darity |edition=2nd |volume=1 |publisher=Macmillan |year=2008 |pages=473–474 |chapterurl=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/uhic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=false&amp;displayGroupName=Reference&amp;currPage=&amp;scanId=&amp;query=&amp;prodId=UHIC&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=UHIC%3AWHIC&amp;mode=view&amp;catId=&amp;limiter=&amp;display-query=&amp;displayGroups=&amp;contentModules=&amp;action=e&amp;sortBy=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CCX3045300295&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;activityType=&amp;failOverType=&amp;commentary=&amp;source=Bookmark&amp;u=mlin_w_amhercol&amp;jsid=0938fef854cc86b83b5fe8a2c4bcb54b |accessdate=6 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When it can only be said that the event happened between two observations or examinations, this is ''interval censoring''.

Left censoring occurs for example when a permanent tooth has already emerged prior to the start of a dental study that aims to estimate its emergence distribution. In the same study, an emergence time is interval-censored when the permanent tooth is present in the mouth at the current examination but not yet at the previous examination. Interval censoring often occurs in HIV/AIDS studies. Indeed, time to HIV seroconversion can only be determined by a laboratory assessment which is usually initiated after a visit to the physician. Then one can only conclude that HIV seroconversion has happened between two examinations. The same is true for the diagnosis of AIDS, which is based on clinical symptoms and needs to be confirmed by a medical examination.

It may also happen that subjects with a lifetime less than some threshold may not be observed at all: this is called ''truncation''. Note that truncation is different from left censoring, since for a left censored datum, we know the subject exists, but for a truncated datum, we may be completely unaware of the subject. Truncation is also common. In a so-called ''delayed entry'' study, subjects are not observed at all until they have reached a certain age. For example, people may not be observed until they have reached the age to enter school. Any deceased subjects in the pre-school age group would be unknown.  Left-truncated data are common in actuarial work for life insurance and pensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Richards |first=S. J. |title=A handbook of parametric survival models for actuarial use |journal=Scandinavian Actuarial Journal |volume=2012 |year=2012 |issue=4 |pages=233–257 |doi=10.1080/03461238.2010.506688 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Left-censored data can occur when a person's survival time becomes incomplete on the left side of the follow-up period for the person. For example, in an epidemiological example, we may monitor a patient for an infectious disorder starting from the time when he or she is tested positive for the infection. Although we may know the right-hand side of the duration of interest, we may never know the exact time of exposure to the infectious agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Singh |first=R. |last2=Mukhopadhyay |first2=K. |title=Survival analysis in clinical trials: Basics and must know areas |journal=[[Perspectives in Clinical Research|Perspect Clin Res]] |year=2011 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=145–148 |doi=10.4103/2229-3485.86872 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fitting parameters to data==
Survival models can be usefully viewed as ordinary regression models in which the response variable is time.  However, computing the likelihood function (needed for fitting parameters or making other kinds of inferences) is complicated by the censoring. The [[likelihood function]] for a survival model, in the presence of censored data, is formulated as follows. By definition the likelihood function is the conditional probability of the data given the parameters of the model.
It is customary to assume that the data are independent given the parameters. Then the likelihood function is the product of the likelihood of each datum. It is convenient to partition the data into four categories: uncensored, left censored, right censored, and interval censored. These are denoted "unc.", "l.c.", "r.c.", and "i.c." in the equation below.

:&lt;math&gt; L(\theta) = \prod_{T_i\in unc.} \Pr(T = T_i\mid\theta)
  \prod_{i\in l.c.} \Pr(T &lt; T_i\mid\theta)
  \prod_{i\in r.c.} \Pr(T &gt; T_i\mid\theta)
  \prod_{i\in i.c.} \Pr(T_{i,l} &lt; T &lt; T_{i,r}\mid\theta) .&lt;/math&gt;

For uncensored data, with &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; equal to the age at death, we have

:&lt;math&gt; \Pr(T = T_i\mid\theta) = f(T_i\mid\theta) .&lt;/math&gt;

For left-censored data, such that the age at death is known to be less than &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt; \Pr(T &lt; T_i\mid\theta) = F(T_i\mid\theta) = 1 - S(T_i\mid\theta) .&lt;/math&gt;

For right-censored data, such that the age at death is known to be greater than &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt; \Pr(T &gt; T_i\mid\theta) = 1 - F(T_i\mid\theta) = S(T_i\mid\theta) .&lt;/math&gt;

For an interval censored datum, such that the age at death is known to be less than &lt;math&gt;T_{i,r}&lt;/math&gt; and greater than &lt;math&gt;T_{i,l}&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt; \Pr(T_{i,l} &lt; T &lt; T_{i,r}\mid\theta)
 = S(T_{i,l}\mid\theta) - S(T_{i,r}\mid\theta) .&lt;/math&gt;

An important application where interval-censored data arises is current status data, where an event &lt;math&gt; T_i&lt;/math&gt; is known not to have occurred before an observation time and to have occurred before the next observation time.

==Non-parametric estimation==

The [[Kaplan-Meier estimator]] can be used to estimate the survival function. The [[Nelson–Aalen estimator]] can be used to provide a [[non-parametric statistics|non-parametric]] estimate of the cumulative hazard rate function.

==Computer software for survival analysis==

The UCLA website http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/ has numerous examples of statistical analyses using SAS, R, SPSS and STATA, including survival analyses.

===Survival analysis in R===

The code below performs the analyses on this Wikipedia page.

====Analyses using the R package "survival"====

The examples above use the R package "survival", except for the tree analyses described below.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="rsplus"&gt;
# Install and load the survival package

install.packages("survival")
library(survival)

# sort the aml data by time
aml &lt;- aml[order(aml$time),]

print(aml)

# Create graph of length of time that each subject was in the study
with(aml, plot(time, type="h"))

# Create the life table survival object for aml
# The functions survfit() and Surv() create a life table survival object.
# The life table object is passed to the plot() function to create the KM plot.
aml.survfit &lt;- survfit(Surv(time, status == 1) ~ 1, data=aml)

# Plot the Kaplan-Meier curve for aml.
# By default, R includes the confidence interval. 
plot(aml.survfit, xlab = "Time (weeks)", ylab="Proportion surviving", main="Survival in AML")

# The summary() function displays the life table
summary(aml.survfit)

# Create aml life tables and KM plots broken out by treatment (x,  "Maintained" vs. "Not maintained")

# Test of proportional hazards assumption
coxph.sex &lt;- coxph(Surv(days, status == 1) ~ sex, data = melanom)

cox.zph(coxph.sex)

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==== Survival tree analysis using the rpart package====

Rpart and the example are described in the PDF document "An Introduction to Recursive Partitioning Using the RPART Routines". Terry M. Therneau, Elizabeth J. Atkinson, Mayo Foundation. September 3, 1997.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="rsplus"&gt;

install.packages("rpart")
library(rpart)

head(stagec)

# Pass a survival object from Surv() to the function rpart() to perform the analysis.
fit &lt;- rpart(Surv(pgtime, pgstat) ~ age + eet + g2 + grade + gleason + ploidy, data=stagec)

# plot the resulting tree

plot(fit, uniform=T, branch=.4, compress=T)
text(fit, use.n=T)
# The print() function provides details of the tree not shown above
print(fit)

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==== Survival random forest models using the randomForestSRC package ====

Note that the R package randomSurvivalForest has been replaced by the package randomForestSRC, "Random Forests for Survival, Regression and Classification". See the randomForestSRC package for documentation on running the example.

'''Synergetics''' is an interdisciplinary science explaining the formation and [[self-organization]] of [[pattern formation|patterns]] and structures in [[open system (systems theory)|open systems]] far from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. It is founded by [[Hermann Haken]], inspired by the [[laser]] theory. Haken's interpretation of the laser principles as self-organization of [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|non-equilibrium system]]s paved the way at the end of the 1960s to the development of synergetics. One of his successful popular books is ''Erfolgsgeheimnisse der Natur'', translated into English as ''The Science of Structure: Synergetics''.

Self-organization requires a 'macroscopic' system, consisting of many nonlinearly interacting subsystems. Depending on the external control parameters (environment, energy-fluxes) self-organization takes place.

==Order-parameter concept==
Essential in synergetics is the order-parameter concept which was originally introduced in the [[Ginzburg-Landau theory]] in order to describe [[phase transition|phase-transitions]] in thermodynamics. The order parameter concept is generalized by Haken to the "enslaving-principle" saying that the dynamics of fast-relaxing (stable) modes is completely determined by the 'slow' dynamics of as a rule only a few 'order-parameters' (unstable modes). The order parameters can be interpreted as the amplitudes of the unstable modes determining the macroscopic pattern.

As a consequence, self-organization means an enormous reduction of [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] (entropy) of the system which macroscopically reveals an increase of 'order' (pattern-formation). This far-reaching macroscopic order is independent of the details of the microscopic interactions of the subsystems. This supposedly explains the [[self-organization]] of patterns in so many different systems in physics, chemistry and biology.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] the statistical properties of laser light change qualitatively at the laser threshold. Below laser threshold noise increases more and more while above threshold it decreases again. [...] Below laser threshold, light consists of individual wave tracks which are emitted from the individual atoms independently of each other. Above laser threshold, a practically infinitely long wave track is produced. In order to make contact with other processes of self-organization let us interpret the processes in a lamp or in a laser by means of Bohr's model of the atom. A lamp produces its light in such a way that the excited electrons of the atoms make their transitions from the outer orbit to the inner orbit entirely independently of each other. On the other hand, the properties of laser light can be understood only if we assume that the transitions of the individual electrons occur in a correlated fashion. [...] Above laser threshold the coherent field grows more and more and it can slave the degrees of freedom of the dipole moments and of the inversion. Within synergetics it has turned out that is a quite typical equation describing effects of self-organization. [...] This equation tells us that the amplitude of the dipoles, which is proportional to A, is instantaneously given by the field amplitude B(t) (and by the fluctuating force). This is probably the simplest example of a principle which has turned out to be of fundamental importance in synergetics and which is called the slaving principle." (''Light: Waves, Photons, and Atoms '', vol. 2; Laser light dynamics - chapter 13)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Uga''' ({{IPAc-en|'|ʌ|g|ə}} {{Respell|UG|ə}}) is the official live mascot of the [[University of Georgia]] [[Georgia Bulldogs|Bulldogs]]. Since 1956, all the dogs serving as Uga have been part of a lineage of English [[Bulldog]]s owned by [[Sonny Seiler]].&lt;ref name=officialsite&gt;[http://www.georgiadogs.com/widecontent/uga.html Official Uga page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415153819/http://www.georgiadogs.com/widecontent/uga.html |date=April 15, 2012 }} at Georgiadogs.com.

==Background==

[[Image:Uga VI.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Uga VI, the official live mascot of the Georgia Bulldogs from 1999–2008]]
The Uga mascot line first started in 1956 when Seiler brought a bulldog that was given to him as a wedding present by Frank Heard to Georgia's first home game of the season. Afterwards, head coach [[Wally Butts]] asked his permission to use the dog as Georgia's mascot, and around the same time a college friend, Billy Young, suggested that he name it Uga, a play on the common abbreviation of the University of Georgia, UGA.&lt;ref name=terryvideo /&gt; Since then, every Uga has been owned by and lived with the Seiler family in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. Even to this day, Uga is owned by the Seiler family, who take care of him when he isn't acting as the mascot on the field. They also transport him to and from the events he attends as mascot.

Traditionally, the current Uga is present at every [[Georgia Bulldogs]] home [[Georgia Bulldogs football|football]] game, many away games, and other University-related functions and sports events, and usually wears a spiked collar and red jersey with varsity letter. The red jersey is Uga's typical "uniform," though he wears a green jersey on St. Patrick's Day.&lt;ref name=terryvideo /&gt; Other special appearances include 1982, when Uga IV attended the [[Heisman Trophy]] Ceremony in New York City wearing a tuxedo, and 2007, when Uga VI wore a black jersey for the "blackout" game against [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn University]]. Uga's jersey is made from the same fabric as the players' official game jerseys, and he even has an official student identification card. He has a custom-built [[air conditioning|air conditioned]] dog house at [[Sanford Stadium]] and typically sits on or near bags of ice at games, as bulldogs are susceptible to heat stroke (a problem in the humid southeastern United States).&lt;ref name=2011mediaguide /&gt;

To date, 10 dogs have carried the name "Uga", which is derived from an abbreviation for the &lt;!-- Please do not change it, refer to the talk page --&gt;''U''niversity of ''G''eorgi''a''.&lt;ref name=terryvideo&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1nmhIP9v8U Terry College of Business Lecture Series] – Sonny Seiler – "Damn Good Dogs! The Real Story of Uga, the University of Georgia's Bulldog Mascots" Last accessed 2012-03-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=branch&gt;{{cite news|last=Branch|first=John|title=Long Live the Mascot, Uga VIII|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/sports/ncaafootball/17bulldog.html|accessdate=November 4, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="magilluga" /&gt; Each has been descended from the original Uga, and has frequently been the son of the predecessor.

Deceased Ugas are interred in a [[mausoleum]] near the main entrance at the southwest corner of Sanford Stadium. A bronze plaque describing each dog's tenure and including an epitaph is engraved in front of each tomb. The tomb's original location was at the east end of Sanford Stadium, and Ugas I and II were originally buried there. Prior to its 1981 enclosure, the University moved the Uga graves to the west end. When the west endzone was enclosed in 1992, the Ugas were entombed in their current resting place, and a bronze, life-sized statue representing Uga was placed in front of the mausoleum.&lt;ref name=terryvideo /&gt; On game days, fans bring flowers and gifts to leave at the tombs of the past bulldogs who served as their team's mascot.

Several Ugas have retired as part of pre-game ceremonies, during which there is a "passing of the collar" and the new Uga begins his reign. During these ceremonies, the fans typically chant "Damn good dog," a tradition dating back to Uga I.

The [[costumed character]] representing the University of Georgia is named [[Hairy Dawg]] and, while also a bulldog, should not be confused with the Ugas.

==Uga as part of the team==

Uga has been considered a part of the football team since the day Uga I, Sonny, was asked to be the official mascot. Uga has his own custom made jersey to wear at every game day that is made with the same materials as the football players' jerseys. His jersey also has his name stitched on the back. When Uga gets a new jersey, or another Uga is named the official mascot, the old jerseys are destroyed.

Uga officially becomes a part of the team through a ceremony on the football field before a game. The head coach will officially welcome the next Uga by placing the well-known spiked collar on the bulldog. Uga X, the current Uga was coronated on November 21, 2015 before the Georgia Southern game. 

In addition, Uga receives a varsity letter in the form of a plaque for his endless support for the athletes. The plaque is identical to those received by the athletes at the end of each season.

Uga even travels with the team, and stays in the same hotel as the players with his own room, with the Seilers. Uga attended the Rose Bowl in 2018, becoming the first ever playoff Uga. Uga X flew to Pasadena, CA with the team, attending all team events, supporting the football team through their playoff run in the 2017-2018 season.

===Temporary mascots===
Since 1956, four other bulldogs (three of which were from the Uga family line) have served as temporary sideline mascots when the current Uga was not available.  The bulldog later known as Uga IX served two terms as an interim mascot before officially becoming Uga IX.
*'''Bugga Lou''' – 1971 – This unrelated, female, brown-and-white bulldog filled in for an ailing Uga II at the [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]] and [[Florida Gators football|Florida]] games during the 1971 season.&lt;ref name="game_wo_bulldog"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.ajc.com/junkyard-blawg/2009/11/20/a-game-without-a-bulldog-makes-history/ | title=A Game Without a Bulldog Makes History | first=Bill | last=King | newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution | date=November 20, 2009 | accessdate=November 20, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123121744/http://blogs.ajc.com/junkyard-blawg/2009/11/20/a-game-without-a-bulldog-makes-history/ | archivedate=November 23, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Argos/Knute''' – 1972 – The dog's given name at birth was Argos, but he had been given to another family member and had his name changed to Knute before he was called into service. Knute served as interim mascot for the first game of the 1972 season against [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]], since Uga II had died and the future Uga III wasn't deemed to be mature enough to serve yet. Uga III was introduced for the second game of the 1972 season against [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="game_wo_bulldog" /&gt;
*'''Otto''' – 1986 – Otto, the older brother of Uga IV, filled in for him during four games in the 1986 season after Uga IV injured his left hind knee jumping off a hotel bed prior to a game against [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]]. Otto compiled a 3–1 record and also served as co-mascot for the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] game that year with Uga IV. Legendary former coach [[Vince Dooley]] has said that Otto was his favorite Georgia mascot, "because he came off the bench and got the job done."&lt;ref name="game_wo_bulldog" /&gt;&lt;ref name=UGAhistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiadogs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=48586&amp;SPID=4107&amp;DB_OEM_ID=8800&amp;ATCLID=454891 |title=History of Our Mascot |accessdate=January 12, 2008 | publisher = UGA Sports Communications | date=July 13, 2006 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Magillicuddy I''' – 1989 – He filled in for an ailing Uga IV, his brother, at the 1989 [[Peach Bowl]]. Uga IV died after the end of the 1989 season, but Magillicuddy was considered to be too old to be named the new mascot.&lt;ref name="game_wo_bulldog" /&gt;

==Georgia mascot history prior to Uga==
Georgia officially claims the following animals as live mascots prior to the introduction of the Uga line in 1956.&lt;ref name="2011mediaguide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiadogs.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/2011-football-media-guide.html |title=Georgia Football 2011 Media Guide |publisher=Georgiadogs.com |accessdate=September 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016061317/http://www.georgiadogs.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/2011-football-media-guide.html |archivedate=October 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''"The Goat"''' (Name Unknown) – 1892 – Appeared at the Georgia–Mercer game on January 30, 1892&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Black and Crimson Waves Triumphantly Over The Ball Ground| newspaper =Athens Weekly Banner| date =February 2, 1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; and first Auburn–Georgia game on February 22, 1892. It was dressed in a black coat with the letters "U.G." in red on each side.&lt;ref name=2011mediaguide /&gt;
*'''Trilby''' – 1894 – Georgia's first canine mascot, Trilby was a solid white female [[Bull Terrier]] owned by student Charles Black, Sr. of Atlanta. After Trilby's 1894 reign, there is no official mascot acknowledged by the university for 50 years. According to the 2011 Georgia football media guide, "... chaos developed in the mascot department at the University. Many games had several, depending on which alumnus got his dog to the game first."&lt;ref&gt;This quote appears in the 2011 Georgia football media guide, and is attributed to the November 18, 1962 edition of the ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mr. Angel''' – 1944–46 – Mr. Angel was a brindle-and-white English Bulldog owned by Warren Coleman, a physician from [[Eastman, Georgia]]. 
*'''Butch''' and '''Tuffy''' – 1947–48 (both), 1948–51 (only Butch) – Butch and Tuffy were brindled English Bulldogs owned by Mabry Smith of [[Warner Robins, Georgia]]. Smith agreed to loan the dogs to the University for use as mascots after bringing them to the 1946 Georgia Tech game (which was the final game of the 1946 regular season). Tuffy died of a heart attack after the 1948 Kentucky game, but Butch served by himself until he was shot and killed by a Warner Robins policeman while roaming the streets in the summer of 1951 after escaping from his pen.
*'''Mike''' – 1951–55 – Mike was a brindled English Bulldog owned by C.L. Fain, and during his time as mascot, he lived in the campus field house. Mike died due to natural causes in 1955. A bronze likeness of Mike stands outside of Memorial Hall on Georgia's campus near Sanford Stadium.

The '''Vogons''' are a fictional alien race from the planet [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Vogsphere|Vogsphere]] in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''—initially a BBC Radio series by [[Douglas Adams]]—who are responsible for the destruction of the Earth, in order to facilitate an intergalactic highway construction project for a hyperspace express route. Vogons are slug-like but vaguely [[humanoid]], are bulkier than humans, and have green skin. Vogons are described as "one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy—not actually evil, but bad-tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous", and having "as much sex appeal as a road accident" as well as being the authors of "the third worst poetry in the universe".  They are employed as the galactic government's [[bureaucrat]]s. According to [[Marvin the Paranoid Android]], they are also the worst [[Marksman|marksmen]] in the galaxy.

==Description==
[[Image:Gillray - John Bull taking a Luncheon.jpg|thumb|The Vogons' appearance in the film was partially based on the cartoons of [[James Gillray]].]]
[[Image:Vogonhead.PNG|thumb|An animatronic Vogon head, used in the film version of the story.]]

===Appearance and personality===
Guide Description:{{quote|Here is what to do if you want to get a lift from a Vogon: forget it. They are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy. Not actually evil, but bad-tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders – signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as firelighters. The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to feed his grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. On no account should you allow a Vogon to read poetry at you.}}

Vogons are roughly human-sized, although much bulkier, with green or grey skin. Their noses are above their eyebrows, which are either ginger (in the television series) or white (in the film). The film's commentary states that the idea behind the high flat noses was that they evolved both the noses and the severe bureaucracy from being repeatedly whacked by the paddle creatures under the sand on Vogsphere whenever they had an independent thought (in the film, the Vogon bureaucracy is centred on Vogsphere). In the radio series it is said that "Their highly domed nose rises above their small piggy forehead".

[[Garth Jennings]] deliberately based his conception of the Vogons on the work of [[cartoonist]] [[James Gillray]] (1757–1815). "His creations were so grotesque...when we looked at them, we realised they ''were'' the Vogons".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Stamp, R. (Ed.) and Simpson, P. ''The Making of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' (Boxtree 2005), p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
The series tells that, far back in prehistory, when the first primeval Vogons crawled out of the sea, evolution gave up on them. Through sheer obstinacy, though, the Vogons survived (partly by adapting a misplaced, badly malformed, and [[Indigestion|dyspeptic]] liver into a [[brain]]). As the radio show says: "What nature refused to give to them, they did without. Until their myriad anatomical deficiencies could be rectified with surgery. They then emigrated ''en masse'' to the MeagaBrantis star cluster (although the film has them staying on Vogsphere), the political hub of the galaxy. They banish the ruling philosophers to the tax office to lick stamps and within a few short Voge years took over pretty much all of the galactic civil service, where they form most of the Galactic bureaucracy, most notably in the Vogon Constructor Fleets (which, despite their name, patrol the galaxy demolishing planets). The only named Vogons in the stories are Jeltz (see below), [[Kwaltz]] (who appears in the film), [[Zarniwoop]], revealed to be a Vogon in the [[Quintessential Phase]], and Jeltz's son Constant Mown.

===Behaviour===
Vogons are described as officiously bureaucratic, a line of work at which they perform so well that the entire galactic bureaucracy is run by them. 

On Vogsphere, the Vogons would sit upon very elegant and beautiful [[gazelle]]-like creatures, whose backs would snap instantly if the Vogons tried to ride them. The Vogons were perfectly happy with just sitting on them. Another favourite Vogon pastime is to import millions of beautiful jewel-backed scuttling [[crab]]s from their native planet, cut down giant trees of breathtaking beauty, and spend a happy drunken night smashing the crabs to bits with iron mallets and cooking the crab meat by burning the trees. In the movie, the Vogons seem to smash the crabs for no apparent reason besides pure pleasure at killing something. 

The Vogons' battle-cry, and counter-argument to dissent, is "resistance is useless!" (cf. "[[Borg (Star Trek)#"Resistance is futile"|Resistance is futile]]").

===Poetry===
[[Image:Vogon jelzt reading poetry.png|thumb|Jeltz reading poetry at [[Arthur Dent]] and [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]] in the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|television series]].]]
Vogon poetry is described as "the third worst poetry in the Universe" behind that of the Azgoths of Kria; four members of an audience died of internal haemorrhaging during a recitation by their poet master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem "Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning" while the President of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos himself was later killed by his own major intestine, which leaped up through his neck and throttled his brain when he attempted to read his twelve-book epic "My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles". Their poetry was also behind that of [[Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings]] of [[Sussex]], which was destroyed when the Earth was. The main example used in the story is a short piece composed by Jeltz, which roughly emulates [[nonsense verse]] in style (example below).
The story relates that listening to it is an experience similar to torture as demonstrated when Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect are forced to listen to the poetry (and say how much they liked it) prior to [[space exposure|being thrown out of an airlock]].

:''"Oh freddled gruntbuggly,''
:''Thy micturations are to me''
:''As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.''
:''Groop, I implore thee, my foonting turlingdromes,''
:''And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,''
:''Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts''
:''With my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!"''

A second example of Vogon poetry is found in the Hitchhiker's Guide [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|interactive fiction game]] that was produced by [[Infocom]]. The first verse is as above; one version of the second verse follows:

:''"Bleem miserable venchit! Bleem forever mestinglish asunder frapt.''

:''Fripping lyshus wimbgunts, awhilst moongrovenly kormzibs.''

An unused extended version of the poem is also excerpted in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s book ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion]]'', in Appendix III.

A third example appears in ''[[The Quintessential Phase]]'' of the radio series, again written by Jeltz.

A fourth example appears in ''[[And Another Thing... (novel)|And Another Thing...]]'', the sixth book in the trilogy written by [[Eoin Colfer]]. The poem is also written by Jeltz.

==Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz==

The Vogon Captain in charge of overseeing the destruction of the Earth, '''Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz''' is sadistic and unpleasant to look at, even by Vogon standards. He enjoys shouting at or executing members of his own crew for insubordination, and takes professional pride in his job of demolishing planets. He very rarely smiles: "Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly. This was done not so much for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequence of muscle movements." 

It is revealed in ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]'' that Jeltz had been hired by [[Gag Halfrunt#Gag Halfrunt|Gag Halfrunt]] to destroy the Earth (though in the film it was Zaphod who gave the order by mistake). Halfrunt had been acting on behalf of a consortium of psychiatrists and the Imperial Galactic Government in order to prevent the discovery of the [[Ultimate Question]].  When Halfrunt learns that [[Arthur Dent]] escaped the planet's destruction, Jeltz is dispatched to track him down and destroy him. Jeltz is unable to complete this task, due to the intervention of [[Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth]], Zaphod's great-grandfather.

In ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', Jeltz is once again responsible for the destruction of the Earth, after the Vogons infiltrate the Hitchhikers' Guide company offices to turn the Guide into a device capable of destroying all Earths in every dimension, this time presumably killing Arthur, Ford, [[Trillian (character)|Trillian]], and Arthur's daughter, [[Random Dent|Random]]—a fate dodged by the characters in the [[Quintessential Phase]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mania.com/hitchhikers-guide-to-galaxy-quintessential-phase-fit-twentysix_article_49054.html "THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY THE QUINTESSENTIAL PHASE: Fit the Twenty-Six"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923163848/http://www.mania.com/hitchhikers-guide-to-galaxy-quintessential-phase-fit-twentysix_article_49054.html |date=2008-09-23 }} – Review by Jason Davis at Mania.com (retrieved 5 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

"Prostetnic Vogon" may be a title, rather than part of his name, since during the second episode of the third radio series (Fit the Fourteenth), two other Prostetnic Vogons are heard from. Also, in ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]'', Gag Halfrunt refers to Jeltz as "Captain of Vogons Prostetnic" (although this may have been a play on Halfrunt's accent).

Jeltz appears in:

*''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''
*''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''
*''[[Mostly Harmless]]''
*''[[And Another Thing... (novel)|And Another Thing...]]''
*[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' (computer game)]]
* The [[Quintessential Phase]].

In the first radio series, he was played by [[Bill Wallis]].  On television, it was [[Martin Benson (actor)|Martin Benson]]. In the third, fourth and fifth radio series, he was played by [[Toby Longworth]], although Longworth did not receive a credit for the role during the third series. In the film, he is voiced by [[Richard Griffiths]]. In cartoon he is voiced by [[Rupert Degas]].

==Spacecraft==
The ships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet were described as "impossibly huge yellow somethings" (the colour being a parallel to [[bulldozer]]s that demolish Arthur's house) that "looked more like they had been congealed than constructed" and "hung in the air in much the same way that bricks don't"; they are said to be undetectable to [[radar]] and capable of travel through [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]]. They are not crewed exclusively by Vogons; a species known as the [[List of races and species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Dentrassis|Dentrassi]] are responsible for on-board catering. 

In the television version of the story, the craft are shaped like [[battleship]]s, albeit with a flat bottom through which the demolition beams are fired. In the film version, the craft are grey and cubic, a continuation of the emphasis on [[bureaucracy]] in the Vogons' conception: "Douglas [Adams]'s description of the Vogon ships hanging in the air in much the same way that bricks don't [led to] these Vogon ships which are these massive concrete [[tower block]]s, with hardly any windows, they just have a few doors around the base," says [[Joel Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Stamp, R. (Ed.) and Simpson, P. ''The Making of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' (Boxtree 2005), p.58&lt;/ref&gt;
