==History==
In 1985, the Physiology Department at New Zealand's [[University of Otago]] encouraged the development of a computer-based data acquisition system to replace their paper-based systems. In 1985, as part of his Computer Science Masters at the university, Michael Macknight built the [[MacLab]], one of the first [[analog to digital converters]] that connected to a [[Macintosh]] computer.

Michael and his father, Tony Macknight, created a company initially known as Analog Digital Instruments. Very soon, they formed a partnership with Boris Schlensky who bought in skills around manufacturing, marketing and distribution.

Two software packages were initially developed: Chart (chart-recorder software, now LabChart) and Scope (digital [[oscilloscope]] software), which provided software control of the recording unit as well as a range of display and analysis features:

*In 1988, business name was registered and the company began manufacturing Macintosh computer-based data acquisition systems for the [[Life Science|life sciences research]] market.
*In 1996 the company's first Windows compatible data acquisition system was released. The Windows compatible MacLab data acquisition systems were branded as PowerLab.
*In 2005 the LabTutor software for education was released.
*In 2015 the kuraCloud cloud based learning platform was released.

==Sponsorship==
The company provides grants, awards and sponsorship to students, researchers and educators in the life sciences industry:

===Undergraduate===

'''Abū Ḥanīfa al-Nuʿmān b. Thābit b. Zūṭā b. Marzubān''' ({{lang-ar|أبو حنيفة نعمان بن ثابت بن زوطا بن مرزبان}}; c. 699 – 767 CE), known as '''Abū Ḥanīfa''' for short, or reverently as '''Imam Abū Ḥanīfa''' by [[Sunni Muslims]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abu-hanifa-noman-b ''ABŪ ḤANĪFA'', Encyclopædia Iranica]&lt;/ref&gt; was an 8th-century [[Sunni Muslim]] [[theologian]] and [[jurist]] of [[Persian people|Persian]] origin,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pakatchi, Ahmad and Umar, Suheyl, "Abū Ḥanīfa", in: ''Encyclopaedia Islamica'', Editors-in-Chief: Wilferd Madelung and, Farhad Daftary.&lt;/ref&gt; who became the eponymous founder of the [[Hanafi]] [[Madh'hab|school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence]], which has remained the most widely practiced law school in the Sunni tradition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He is often alluded to by the reverential epithets '''''al-Imām al-aʿẓam''''' ("The Great Imam") and '''''Sirāj al-aʾimma''''' ("The Lamp of the Imams") in Sunni Islam.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt;

Born to a Muslim family in [[Kufa]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Abu Hanifa is known to have travelled to the [[Hejaz]] [[region]] of [[Arabia]] in his youth, where he studied under the most renowned teachers in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] at the time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As his career as a theologian and jurist progressed, Abu Hanifa became known for favoring the use of [[reason]] in his legal rulings (''faqīh dhū raʾy'') and even in his theology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Abu Hanifa's theological school is what would later develop into the [[Maturidi]] school of [[aqidah|orthodox Sunni theology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
He is also considered a renowned Islamic scholar and personality by [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydi]] Shia Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abu Bakr al-Jassas al-Razi|title=Ahkam al-Quran|publisher=Dar Al-Fikr Al-Beirutiyya|pages=volume 1 page 100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Childhood===
Abū Ḥanīfah was born in the city of [[Kufa]] in [[Iraq]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFZsBgAAQBAJ|title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|last=Meri|first=Josef W.|date=October 31, 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135456030|page=5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hisham M. Ramadan, ''Understanding Islamic Law: From Classical to Contemporary'', (AltaMira Press: 2006), p.26&lt;/ref&gt; during the reign of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]]. His father, Thabit bin Zuta, a trader from [[Kabul]] (today in Afghanistan), was 40 years old at the time of Abū Ḥanīfah's birth.

His ancestry is generally accepted as being of [[Persian people|Persian]] origin as suggested by the etymology of the names of his grandfather (Zuta) and great-grandfather (Mah). The historian [[Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi]] records a statement from Imām Abū Ḥanīfah's grandson, Ismail bin Hammad, who gave Abū Ḥanīfah's lineage as Thabit bin Numan bin Marzban and claiming to be of Persian origin.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;S. H. Nasr (1975), "The religious sciences", in R.N. Frye, ''The Cambridge History of Iran'', Volume 4, Cambridge University Press. pg 474: "Abū Ḥanīfah, who is often called the "grand imam"(al-Imam al-'Azam) was Persian&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cyril&gt;Cyril Glasse, "The New Encyclopedia of Islam", Published by Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008. pg 23: "Abu Hanifah, a Persian, was one of the great jurists of Islam and one of the historic Sunni Mujtahids"&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancy in the names, as given by Ismail of Abū Ḥanīfah's grandfather and great-grandfather, are thought to be due to Zuta's adoption of the [[Arabic name]] (Numan) upon his acceptance of [[Islam]] and that Mah and [[Marzban]] were titles or official designations in Persia, with the latter, meaning a [[margrave]], referring to the noble ancestry of Abū Ḥanīfah's family as the [[Sasanian]] [[Marzban]]s (equivalent of [[margraves]]). The widely accepted opinion, however, is that most probably he was of Persian ancestry .&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cyril"/&gt;

===Adulthood and death===
[[File:Abu Hanifa Mosque, 2008.jpg|thumb|[[Abu Hanifa Mosque]] in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]]]]

In 763, [[al-Mansur]], the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] monarch offered Abu Hanifa the post of Chief Judge of the State, but he declined the offer, choosing to remain independent. His student [[Abu Yusuf]] was later appointed ''[[Qadi]] Al-Qudat'' (Chief Judge of the State) by the Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e40?_hi=0&amp;_pos=10|title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|last=|first=|date=|website=Abu Yusuf|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his reply to al-Mansur, Abū Ḥanīfah said that he was not fit for the post. Al-Mansur, who had his own ideas and reasons for offering the post, lost his temper and accused Abū Ḥanīfah of lying.

"If I am lying," Abū Ḥanīfah said, "then my statement is doubly correct. How can you appoint a liar to the exalted post of a Chief Qadi (Judge)?"

Incensed by this reply, the ruler had Abū Ḥanīfah arrested, locked in prison and tortured. He was never fed nor cared for.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ya'qubi]], vol. III, p.86; Muruj al-dhahab, vol. III, pp. 268–270.&lt;/ref&gt; Even there, the jurist continued to teach those who were permitted to come to him.

On the 15 Rajab 150&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.islamicinformationcentre.co.uk/alsunna.htm |title=Understanding the Ahle al-Sunnah: Traditional Scholarship &amp; Modern Misunderstandings |last=Ammar |first=Abu |publisher=Islamic Information Centre |year=2001 |chapter=Criticism levelled against Imam Abu Hanifah |access-date=2018-06-13 |chapter-url=http://www.islamicinformationcentre.co.uk/alsunna7.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; (August 15, 767&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://habibur.com/hijri/150/7/ |title=Islamic Hijri Calendar For Rajab – 150 Hijri |website=habibur.com |access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Abū Ḥanīfah died in prison. The cause of his death is not clear, as some say that Abū Ḥanīfah issued a legal opinion for bearing arms against Al-Mansur, and the latter had him poisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Najeebabadi, Akbar S. (2001). The History of Islam. vol, 2. Darussalam Press. pp. 287. {{ISBN|9960-892-88-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The fellow prisoner and Jewish Karaite founder, Anan Ben David, is said to have received life-saving counsel from the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Nemoy, Leon. (1952).  Karaite Anthology: Excerpts from the Early Literature. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. pp. 4–5. {{ISBN|0-300-00792-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that so many people attended his funeral that the funeral service was repeated six times for more than 50,000 people who had amassed before he was actually buried. On the authority of the historian al-Khatib, it can be said that for full twenty days people went on performing funeral prayer for him. Later, after many years, the [[Abu Hanifa Mosque|Abū Ḥanīfah Mosque]] was built in the [[Adhamiyah]] neighbourhood of [[Baghdad]].

The tomb of Abū Ḥanīfah and the tomb of [[Abdul Qadir Gilani]] were destroyed by [[Shah Ismail]] of [[Safavid|Safavi empire]] in 1508.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=hanifa+tomb+destroyed+safavids&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PdV5MaKFs9&amp;sig=0UhW6VaXCVVo0jFhkItxRPp_yC4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5gCuTeLqKIjagAfx6ITsCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=hanifa%20tomb%20destroyed%20safavids&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1533, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] conquered [[Baghdad]] and rebuilt the tomb of Abū Ḥanīfah and other Sunni sites.&lt;ref name="burak"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Second Formation of Islamic Law: The Ḥanafī School in the Early Modern Ottoman Empire|last=Burak|first=Guy|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-09027-9|place=Cambridge|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources and methodology==

The sources from which Abu Hanifa derived Islamic law, in order of importance and preference, are: the [[Qur'an]], the authentic narrations of the Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]] (known as [[hadith]]), consensus of the Muslim community ([[ijma]]), analogical reasoning ([[qiyas]]), juristic discretion ([[istihsan]]) and the customs of the local population enacting said law ([[urf]]). The development of analogical reason and the scope and boundaries by which it may be used is recognized by the majority of Muslim jurists, but its establishment as a legal tool is the result of the Hanafi school. While it was likely used by some of his teachers, Abu Hanifa is regarded by modern scholarship as the first to formally adopt and institute analogical reason as a part of Islamic law.&lt;ref&gt;See:&lt;br /&gt;*[[Reuben Levy]], ''Introduction to the Sociology of Islam'', pg. 236–237.

As the fourth Caliph, [[Ali]] had transferred the Islamic capital to [[Kufa]], and many of the [[Sahaba|first generation]] of Muslims had settled there, the Hanafi school of law based many of its rulings on the prophetic tradition as transmitted by those first generation Muslims residing in Iraq. Thus, the Hanafi school came to be known as the Kufan or Iraqi school in earlier times. Ali and [[Abdullah, son of Masud]] formed much of the base of the school, as well as other personalities from the direct relatives (or [[Ahl al-Bayt|Ahli-ll-Bayṫ]]) of [[Muhammad|Moḥammad]] from whom Abu Hanifa had studied such as [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] (thus apparently creating a link between [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]s and [[Shia Islam|Shia]]s). Many jurists and historians had reportedly lived in Kufa, including one of Abu Hanifa's main teachers, Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Generational status==

Abū Ḥanīfah is regarded by some as one of the [[Tabi‘un]], the generation after the [[Sahaba]], who were the companions of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]]. This is based on reports that he met at least four [[Sahabah|Sahaba]] including [[Anas ibn Malik]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; with some even reporting that he transmitted [[Hadith]] from him and other companions of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="masud"&gt;[http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/misc/abu_hanifa.htm Imām-ul-A’zam Abū Ḥanīfah, The Theologian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.islamicinformationcentre.co.uk/alsunna7.htm last accessed June 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Others take the view that Abū Ḥanīfah only saw around half a dozen companions, possibly at a young age, and did not directly narrate hadith from them.&lt;ref name="masud"/&gt;

Abū Ḥanīfah was born 67 years after the death of Muhammad, but during the time of the first generation of Muslims, some of whom lived on until Abū Ḥanīfah's youth. [[Anas bin Malik]], Muhammad's personal attendant, died in 93 AH and another companion, Abul Tufail Amir bin Wathilah, died in 100 AH, when Abū Ḥanīfah was 20 years old. The author of al-Khairat al-Hisan collected information from books of biographies and cited the names of Muslims of the first generation from whom it is reported that the Abu Hanifa had transmitted hadith. He counted them as sixteen, including [[Anas ibn Malik]], [[Jabir ibn Abd-Allah]] and [[Sahl ibn Sa'd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/misc/abu_hanifa.htm |title=Imam-ul-A’zam Abū Ḥanīfah, The Theologian |publisher=Masud.co.uk |date= |accessdate=February 7, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100212202055/http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/misc/abu_hanifa.htm| archivedate= February 12, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Madhhab Map3.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Muslim world. Hanafi (grass green) is the Sunni school predominant in Turkey, the Northern Middle East, many parts of Egypt, Central Asia and most of the Indian subcontinent]]
Abu Hanifa ranks as one of the greatest jurists of Islamic civilization and one of the major legal philosophers of the entire human community.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CurSh3Sh_KMC|title=Dictionary of World Biography: The Middle Ages|last=Magill|first=Frank Northen|date=January 1, 1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781579580414|page=18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attained a very high status in the various fields of sacred knowledge and significantly influenced the development of Muslim theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CurSh3Sh_KMC|title=Dictionary of World Biography: The Middle Ages|last=Magill|first=Frank Northen|date=January 1, 1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781579580414|page=17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime he was acknowledged by the people as a jurist of the highest calibre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPCN1yXEdg8C|title=The Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law|last=Hallaq|first=Wael B.|date=January 1, 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521005807|page=159|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of his scholarly achievements Abu Hanifa is popularly known amongst [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] as a man of the highest personal qualities:  a performer of good works, remarkable for his self-denial, humble spirit, devotion and pious awe of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YYxZ0QpKBGsC|title=An Introduction to Islam|last=Waines|first=David|date=November 6, 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521539067|page=66|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His tomb, surmounted by a dome erected by admirers in 1066 is still a shrine for pilgrims.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was given a restoration in 1535 by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] upon the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of Baghdad.&lt;ref name="burak" /&gt;

Abu Hanifa also had critics. The [[Zahiri]] scholar [[Ibn Hazm]] quotes [[Sufyan ibn `Uyaynah]]: "[T]he aﬀairs of men were in harmony until they were changed by Abù Hanìfa in Kùfa, al-Batti in Basra and Màlik in Medina".&lt;ref&gt;[[Camilla Adang]], "This Day I have Perfected Your Religion For You: A Zahiri Conception of Religious Authority," p.33.

'''Acute liver failure''' is the appearance of severe complications rapidly after the first signs of [[liver]] disease (such as [[jaundice]]), and indicates that the liver has sustained severe damage (loss of function of 80–90% of liver cells). The complications are [[hepatic encephalopathy]] and impaired [[protein synthesis]] (as measured by the levels of [[serum albumin]] and the [[prothrombin time]] in the blood). The 1993 classification defines ''hyperacute'' as within 1 week, ''acute'' as 8–28 days, and ''subacute'' as 4–12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Grady JG, Schalm SW, Williams R |title=Acute liver failure: redefining the syndromes |journal=Lancet |volume=342 |issue=8866 |pages=273–5 |year=1993 |pmid=8101303 |doi= 10.1016/0140-6736(93)91818-7|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0140-6736(93)91818-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects the fact that the pace of disease evolution strongly influences prognosis. Underlying cause is the other significant determinant of outcome.&lt;ref name="ogredy1"&gt;{{cite journal |author =O'Grady JG |title=Acute liver failure |journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal |volume=81 |issue=953 |pages=148–54 |year=2005 |pmid=15749789 |doi=10.1136/pgmj.2004.026005 |pmc=1743234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
The main features of acute liver failure are rapid-onset jaundice, weakness, and eventually, changes in mental status that can begin as mild confusion but progress to coma.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Encephalopathy and cerebral edema===

In ALF, [[hepatic encephalopathy]] leads to [[cerebral edema]], [[coma]], [[brain herniation]], and eventually death.  Detection of encephalopathy is central to the diagnosis of ALF.  It may vary from subtle deficit in [[higher brain function]] (e.g. mood, concentration in grade I) to deep coma (grade IV).  Patients presenting as acute and hyperacute liver failure are at greater risk of developing cerebral oedema and grade IV encephalopathy. The [[pathogenesis]] remains unclear, but is likely to be a consequence of several phenomena.  There is a buildup of toxic substances like [[ammonia]], [[mercaptan]], [[benzodiazepines]], [[serotonin]] and [[tryptophan]] in the brain.  This affects [[neurotransmitter]] level and [[neuroreceptor]] activation.  Autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is impaired, and is associated with [[anaerobic glycolysis]] and [[oxidative stress]].  Neuronal cell [[astrocyte]]s are susceptible to these changes, and they swell up, resulting in increased intracranial pressure.  Inflammatory mediators also play important role.&lt;ref name="ogredy1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hazell, Alan S. |author2=Butterworth, Roger F. |title=Hepatic encephalopathy: An update of pathophysiologic mechanisms |journal=Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. |volume=222 |issue=2|pages=99–112 |year=1999 |pmid=10564534 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-1373.1999.d01-120.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Larsen FS, Wendon J |title=Brain edema in liver failure: basic physiologic principles and management |journal=Liver Transpl.|volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=983–9 |year=2002 |pmid=12424710 |doi=10.1053/jlts.2002.35779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, signs of elevated [[intracranial pressure]], such as [[papilledema]] and loss of [[pupillary]] reflexes, are not reliable, and occur late in the disease process.  [[Computed tomography|CT]] imaging of the brain is also unhelpful in detecting early cerebral oedema, but is often performed to rule out [[Intracranial hemorrhage|intra-cerebral bleeding]].  Invasive intracranial pressure monitoring via [[Dura mater|subdural]] route is often recommended; however, the risk of complications must be weighed against the possible benefit (1% fatal haemorrhage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Armstrong IR, Pollok A, Lee A |title=Complications of intracranial pressure monitoring in fulminant hepatic failure |journal=Lancet|volume=341 |issue=8846 |pages=690–1 |year=1993 |pmid=8095592 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(93)90458-S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The aim is to maintain intracranial pressures below 25&amp;nbsp;mm Hg, and cerebral perfusion pressures above 50&amp;nbsp;mm Hg.&lt;ref name="ogredy1"/&gt;

===Coagulopathy===

[[Coagulopathy]] is another cardinal feature of ALF. The liver has the central role in the synthesis of almost all coagulation factors and some inhibitors of [[coagulation]] and [[fibrinolysis]]. [[Hepatocellular]] [[necrosis]] leads to impaired [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] of many [[coagulation factors]] and their inhibitors. The former produces a prolongation in [[prothrombin time]] which is widely used to monitor the severity of [[hepatic]] injury. There is significant platelet dysfunction (with both quantitative and qualitative platelet defects). Progressive [[thrombocytopenia]] with the loss of larger and more active [[platelet]]s is almost universal. Thrombocytopenia with or without [[disseminated intravascular coagulation|DIC]] increases risk of intracerebral bleeding.&lt;ref name="gimson"/&gt;

===Kidney failure===
[[Kidney failure]] is common, present in more than 50% of ALF patients, either due to original insult such as paracetamol resulting in [[acute tubular necrosis]] or from [[hyperdynamic circulation]] leading to [[hepatorenal syndrome]] or functional kidney failure. Because of impaired production of urea, blood urea does not represent the degree of kidney impairment.

===Inflammation and infection===
About 60% of all ALF patients fulfil the criteria for [[Systemic inflammatory response syndrome|systemic inflammatory syndrome]] irrespective of presence or absence of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmidt LE, Larsen FS |title=Prognostic implications of [[lactic acid|hyperlactatemia]], multiple organ failure, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in patients with acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure |journal=Crit. Care Med. |volume=34 |issue=2|pages=337–43 |year=2006 |pmid=16424712 |doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000194724.70031.B6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often contributes towards [[Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multi organ failure]]. Impaired host defence mechanism, due to impaired [[opsonization]], [[chemotaxis]] and intracellular killing, substantially increases risk of sepsis. Bacterial sepsis mostly due to [[gram positive]] organisms and fungal sepsis are observed in up to 80% and 30% patients, respectively.&lt;ref name="gimson"&gt;{{cite journal |author =Gimson AE |title=Fulminant and late onset hepatic failure |journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=90–8 |year=1996 |pmid=8703634 |doi=10.1093/bja/77.1.90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metabolic derangements===
[[Hyponatraemia]] is an almost universal finding due to water retention and a shift in [[intracellular]] sodium transport from inhibition of [[Na/K ATPase]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. [[Hypoglycaemia]] (due to depleted hepatic [[glycogen]] store and [[insulin|hyperinsulinaemia]]), [[hypokalaemia]], [[hypophosphataemia]] and [[Metabolic alkalosis]] are often present, independent of renal function. [[Lactic acidosis]] occurs predominantly in [[paracetamol toxicity|paracetomol (also known as acetaminophen) overdose]].

===Haemodynamic and cardio-respiratory compromise===

[[Hyperdynamic circulation]], with peripheral [[vasodilator|vasodilatation]] from low [[systemic vascular resistance]], leads to [[hypotension]]. There is a compensatory increase in [[cardiac output]]. [[Adrenal insufficiency]] has been documented in 60% of ALF cases, and is likely to contribute in haemodynamic compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harry R, Auzinger G, Wendon J |title=The clinical importance of adrenal insufficiency in acute hepatic dysfunction|journal=Hepatology |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=395–402 |year=2002 |pmid=12143048 |doi=10.1053/jhep.2002.34514}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also abnormal [[oxygen]] transport and utilization. Although delivery of oxygen to the tissues is adequate, there is a decrease in tissue oxygen uptake, resulting in [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and lactic acidosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bihari D, Gimson AE, Waterson M, Williams R |title=Tissue hypoxia during fulminant hepatic failure |journal=Crit. Care Med. |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=1034–9 |year=1985 |pmid=3933911|doi=10.1097/00003246-198512000-00010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pulmonary]] complications occur in up to 50% of patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trewby PN, Warren R, Contini S |title=Incidence and pathophysiology of pulmonary edema in fulminant hepatic failure |journal=Gastroenterology|volume=74 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=859–65 |year=1978 |pmid=346431 |doi=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severe lung injury and [[hypoxemia]] result in high mortality. Most cases of severe lung injury are due to [[ARDS]], with or without [[sepsis]]. Pulmonary [[haemorrhage]], [[pleural effusion]]s, [[atelectasis]], and [[intrapulmonary shunt]]s also contribute to respiratory difficulty.

===Late pregnancy===

In late pregnancy liver function decreases significantly, which can be easily monitored by blood tests. Early clinical manifestations of ALF in late pregnancy include hypodynamia, decrease in appetite, dark amber urine, deep jaundice, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li XM, Ma L, Yang YB, Shi ZJ, Zhou SS |title=Clinical characteristics of fulminant hepatitis in pregnancy|journal=World J Gastroenterol |volume=11 |issue=29|pages=4600–3 |year=2005 |pmid=16052697 |doi=10.3748/wjg.v11.i29.4600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among patients whose deaths were attributed to ALF in late pregnancy, the majority had experienced vaginal deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li XM, Ma L, Yang YB, Shi ZJ, Zhou SS |title=Prognostic factors of fulminant hepatitis in pregnancy|journal=Chin Med J (Engl)|volume=118 |issue=20|pages=1754–7 |year=2005 |pmid=16313765 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

Common causes for acute liver failure are [[Paracetamol toxicity|paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose]], idiosyncratic reaction to medication (e.g. [[tetracycline]], [[troglitazone]]), excessive [[alcohol consumption]] (severe [[alcoholic hepatitis]]), viral hepatitis ([[hepatitis A]] or [[hepatitis B|B]] — it is extremely uncommon in [[hepatitis C]]), [[acute fatty liver of pregnancy]], and idiopathic (without an obvious cause). [[Reye syndrome]] is acute liver failure in a child with a viral infection (e.g. [[chickenpox]]); it appears that [[aspirin]] use may play a significant role. [[Wilson's disease]] (hereditary copper accumulation) may infrequently present with acute liver failure. Acute liver failure also results from [[mushroom poisoning|poisoning]] by the death cap mushroom (''[[Amanita phalloides]]'') as well as other [[amatoxin]]-producing fungus species.

== Pathophysiology ==
[[Image:Hepato-biliary.jpg|thumb|Diagram of hepatobiliary system]]
In the majority of acute liver failure (ALF) there is widespread hepatocellular necrosis beginning in the [[hepatic lobule|centrizonal distribution]] and progressing towards [[portal tract]]s. The degree of [[parenchymal]] inflammation is variable and  is proportional to duration of [[disease]].&lt;ref name="gimson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boyer JL, Klatskin G |title=Pattern of necrosis in acute viral hepatitis. Prognostic value of bridging (subacute hepatic necrosis) |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=283 |issue=20 |pages=1063–71 |year=1970 |pmid=4319402 |doi=10.1056/NEJM197011122832001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zone 1 (periportal) occurs in phosphorus poisoning or eclampsia.
Zone 2 (mid-zonal), although rare, is seen in [[yellow fever]].
Zone 3 (centrilobular) occurs with ischemic injury, toxic effects, carbon tetrachloride exposure, or chloroform ingestion.  In acute acetaminophen overdose, [[toxification]] occurs, mostly in Zone III which has the highest level of P450 micro-enzymes.  That fact along with Zone III's decreased oxygen level helps to explain why it is preferentially one of the initial sites of damage.

== Evaluation==

All patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of moderate to severe acute hepatitis should have an immediate measurement of prothrombin time and careful evaluation of mental status. If the prothrombin time is prolonged by ≈ 4–6 seconds or more (INR ≥ 1.5),
and there is any evidence of altered [[sensorium]], the diagnosis of ALF should be strongly suspected, and hospital admission is mandatory.&lt;ref name="Polson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Polson J, Lee WM |title=AASLD position paper: the management of acute liver failure |journal=Hepatology |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=1179–97 |year=2005 |pmid=15841455 |doi=10.1002/hep.20703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial laboratory examination must be extensive in order to evaluate both the etiology and severity.

;Initial laboratory analysis&lt;ref name="Polson"/&gt;
*[[Prothrombin time]]/INR
*[[Complete blood count]]
*Chemistries
**Liver function test: [[Aspartate transaminase|AST]], [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]], [[alkaline phosphatase]], [[Gamma-glutamyl transferase|GGT]], total [[bilirubin]], [[albumin]]
**[[Creatinine]], urea/[[blood urea nitrogen]], sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, phosphate
**[[Blood sugar|Glucose]]
**[[Amylase]] and [[lipase]]
*[[Arterial blood gas]], [[lactic acid|lactate]]

*[[Ceruloplasmin]] level (when Wilson's disease suspected)

*[[Ammonia]] (arterial if possible)
*[[HIV]] status (has implication for [[Organ transplant|transplantation]])

History taking should include a careful review of possible exposures to viral infection and drugs or other toxins. From history and clinical examination, the possibility of underlying chronic disease should be ruled out as it may require different management.

A [[liver biopsy]] done via the [[jugular|transjugular]] route because of [[coagulopathy]] is not usually necessary, other than in occasional malignancies. As the evaluation continues, several important decisions have to be made; such as whether to admit the patient to an ICU, or whether to transfer the patient to a transplant facility. Consultation with the transplant center as early as possible is critical due to the possibility of rapid progression of ALF.

===Definition===

Acute liver failure is defined as "the rapid development of hepatocellular dysfunction, specifically coagulopathy and mental status changes (encephalopathy) in a patient without known prior liver disease".&lt;ref name=Sleisenger&gt;{{cite book|last=Sleisenger|first=edited by Mark Feldman, Lawrence S. Friedman, Lawrence J. Brandt; consulting editor, Marvin H.|title=Sleisenger &amp; Fordtran's gastrointestinal and liver disease pathophysiology, diagnosis, management|year=2009|publisher=MD Consult|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=978-1-4160-6189-2|url=http://www.mdconsult.com/das/book/pdf/307505734-5/978-1-4160-6189-2/4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-6189-2..00093-7..DOCPDF.pdf?isbn=978-1-4160-6189-2&amp;eid=4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-6189-2..00093-7..DOCPDF|edition=9th }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;page 1557&lt;/sup&gt;

The diagnosis of acute liver failure is based on physical exam, laboratory findings, patient history, and past medical history to establish mental status changes, coagulopathy, rapidity of onset, and absence of known prior liver disease respectively.&lt;ref name=Sleisenger /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;page 1557&lt;/sup&gt;

The exact definition of "rapid" is somewhat questionable, and different sub-divisions exist which are based on the time from onset of first hepatic symptoms to onset of encephalopathy. One scheme defines "acute hepatic failure" as the development of encephalopathy within 26 weeks of the onset of any hepatic symptoms. This is sub-divided into "fulminant hepatic failure", which requires onset of encephalopathy within 8 weeks, and "subfulminant", which describes onset of encephalopathy after 8 weeks but before 26 weeks.&lt;ref name=medscape&gt;{{cite web|last=Sood|first=Gagan K|title=Acute Liver Failure|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/177354-overview|publisher=Mescape|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another scheme defines "hyperacute" as onset within 7 days, "acute" as onset between 7 and 28 days, and "subacute" as onset between 28 days and 24 weeks.&lt;ref name=Sleisenger /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;page 1557&lt;/sup&gt;

=== General concerns === 
Because ALF often involves the rapid deterioration of mental status and the potential for multiorgan failure, patients should be managed in the [[intensive care]] unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jalan|first1=R|title=Acute liver failure: current management and future prospects.|journal=Journal of Hepatology|date=2005|volume=42 Suppl|issue=1|pages=S115-23|pmid=15777566|doi=10.1016/j.jhep.2004.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For patients not at a transplant center, the possibility of rapid progression of ALF makes early consultation with a transplant facility critical. Accordingly, plans for transfer to a transplant center should begin in patients with any abnormal mentation. Early institution of antidotes or specific therapy may prevent the need for liver transplantation and reduce the likelihood of poor outcome. Measures appropriate for specific causes of ALF are described in detail later in this chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polson|first1=J|last2=Lee|first2=WM|last3=American Association for the Study of Liver|first3=Disease|title=AASLD position paper: the management of acute liver failure.|journal=Hepatology|date=May 2005|volume=41|issue=5|pages=1179–97|pmid=15841455|doi=10.1002/hep.20703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neurologic complications ===
Patients with grade I–II [[encephalopathy]] should be transferred to a [[liver]] transplant facility and listed for transplantation. Consider a brain computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out other causes of altered or impaired mental status. Stimulation and overhydration can cause elevations in intracranial pressure (ICP) and should be avoided. Unmanageable agitation may be treated with short-acting benzodiazepines in small doses. Lactulose can be considered at this stage. A preliminary report from the ALFSG on 117 patients suggests that use of lactulose in the first 7 days after diagnosis is associated with a small increase in survival time, but with no difference in severity of encephalopathy or in the overall outcome. For patients who progress to grade III–IV encephalopathy, intubation for airway protection is generally required. Many centers use propofol for sedation because it may reduce cerebral blood. The head of the bed should be elevated to 30 degrees, and electrolytes, blood gasses, glucose, and neurologic status monitored frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jalan|first1=R|title=Intracranial hypertension in acute liver failure: pathophysiological basis of rational management.|journal=Seminars in liver disease|date=August 2003|volume=23|issue=3|pages=271–82|pmid=14523680|doi=10.1055/s-2003-42645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jalan|first1=R|last2=Olde Damink|first2=SW|last3=Deutz|first3=NE|last4=Davies|first4=NA|last5=Garden|first5=OJ|last6=Madhavan|first6=KK|last7=Hayes|first7=PC|last8=Lee|first8=A|title=Moderate hypothermia prevents cerebral hyperemia and increase in intracranial pressure in patients undergoing liver transplantation for acute liver failure.|journal=Transplantation|date=27 June 2003|volume=75|issue=12|pages=2034–9|pmid=12829907|doi=10.1097/01.tp.0000066240.42113.ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cardiovascular complications ===
Increased cardiac output and low systemic vascular resistance are characteristic of ALF. Pulmonary artery catheterization should be considered. Hypotension should be treated preferentially with fluids, but systemic vasopressor support with agents such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or dopamine should be used if fluid replacement fails to maintain mean arterial pressure of 50–60&amp;nbsp;mm Hg. Vasoconstrictive agents (especially vasopressin) should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=N|last2=Auzinger|first2=G|last3=Bernel|first3=W|last4=Wendon|first4=J|title=The effect of hypertonic sodium chloride on intracranial pressure in patients with acute liver failure.|journal=Hepatology|date=February 2004|volume=39|issue=2|pages=464–70|pmid=14767999|doi=10.1002/hep.20056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pulmonary complications ===
Pulmonary edema and pulmonary infections are commonly seen in patients with ALF. Mechanical ventilation may be required. However, positive end-expiratory pressure can worsen cerebral edema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wijdicks|first1=EF|last2=Nyberg|first2=SL|title=Propofol to control intracranial pressure in fulminant hepatic failure.|journal=Transplantation proceedings|date=June 2002|volume=34|issue=4|pages=1220–2|pmid=12072321|doi=10.1016/s0041-1345(02)02804-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coagulopathy and gastrointestinal bleeding ===
Impaired liver synthesis of clotting factors, low-grade fibrinolysis, and intravascular coagulation are typical of ALF. Thrombocytopenia is common and may also be dysfunctional. Replacement therapy is recommended only in the setting of bleeding or prior to an invasive procedure. Vitamin K can be given to treat an abnormal prothrombin time, regardless of whether there is poor nutritional status. Administration of recombinant factor VIIa has shown promise; however, this treatment approach requires further study. The use of gastrointestinal hemorrhage prophylaxis with a histamine-2 (H2) blocker, proton pump inhibitor, or sucralfate is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shami|first1=VM|last2=Caldwell|first2=SH|last3=Hespenheide|first3=EE|last4=Arseneau|first4=KO|last5=Bickston|first5=SJ|last6=Macik|first6=BG|title=Recombinant activated factor VII for coagulopathy in fulminant hepatic failure compared with conventional therapy.|journal=Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society|date=February 2003|volume=9|issue=2|pages=138–43|pmid=12548507|doi=10.1053/jlts.2003.50017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nutrition, electrolytes, and metabolic derangements ===
In patients with grade I or II encephalopathy, enteral feeding should be initiated early. Parenteral nutrition should be used only if enteral feeding is contraindicated as it increases the risk of infection. Severe restriction of protein is not beneficial; 60 g/day of protein is generally reasonable. Fluid replacement with colloid (e.g. albumin) is preferred rather than crystalloid (e.g. saline); all solutions should contain dextrose to maintain euglycemia. Multiple electrolyte abnormalities are common in ALF. Correction of hypokalemia is essential as hypokalemia increases the kidneys' ammonia production, potentially exacerbating encephalopathy. Hypophosphatemia is especially common in patients with acetaminophen-induced ALF and in those with intact renal function. Hypoglycemia occurs in many patients with ALF and is often due to depletion of hepatic glycogen stores and impaired gluconeogenesis. Plasma glucose concentration should be monitored and hypertonic glucose administered as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown RS|first1=Jr|last2=Russo|first2=MW|last3=Lai|first3=M|last4=Shiffman|first4=ML|last5=Richardson|first5=MC|last6=Everhart|first6=JE|last7=Hoofnagle|first7=JH|title=A survey of liver transplantation from living adult donors in the United States.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=27 February 2003|volume=348|issue=9|pages=818–25|pmid=12606737|doi=10.1056/nejmsa021345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infection ===
Bacterial and fungal infections are common in ALF, with one study demonstrating culture-proven infection in 80% of ALF patients. Defective cellular and humoral immunity as well as presence of indwelling catheters, coma, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and medications that suppress immunity all predispose to infection. Localizing symptoms of infection such as fever and sputum production are frequently absent and the only clues to an underlying infectious process may be worsening of encephalopathy or renal function. There must be a low threshold for obtaining frequent cultures (blood, urine, and sputum), chest radiographs, and paracentesis. Bacteria that enter through the skin, such as streptococci and staphylococci, tend to predominate. Aggressive surveillance is essential as prophylactic antibiotics have shown little benefit. Fungal infections, particularly in the setting of broad-spectrum antibiotics, are also common, and disseminated fungemia is a poor prognostic sign.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farmer|first1=DG|last2=Anselmo|first2=DM|last3=Ghobrial|first3=RM|last4=Yersiz|first4=H|last5=McDiarmid|first5=SV|last6=Cao|first6=C|last7=Weaver|first7=M|last8=Figueroa|first8=J|last9=Khan|first9=K|last10=Vargas|first10=J|last11=Saab|first11=S|last12=Han|first12=S|last13=Durazo|first13=F|last14=Goldstein|first14=L|last15=Holt|first15=C|last16=Busuttil|first16=RW|title=Liver transplantation for fulminant hepatic failure: experience with more than 200 patients over a 17-year period.|journal=Annals of Surgery|date=May 2003|volume=237|issue=5|pages=666–75; discussion 675–6|pmid=12724633|doi=10.1097/01.sla.0000064365.54197.9e|pmc=1514517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liver transplantation ===
The advent of transplantation has changed survival from as low as 15% in the pretransplant era to more than 60% today. Liver transplantation is indicated for many patients with ALF, and survival rates of 56–90% can be achieved. In addition to transplantation, better critical care and the trend toward more benign causes, such as acetaminophen, all contribute to improved survival rates. Spontaneous survival is now around 40%. The application of transplantation among patients with ALF remains low, suggesting that the full potential of this modality may not be realized. Timely availability of an allograft is one of the major factors determining transplant outcomes. In the largest U.S. study, only 29% of patients received a liver graft, while 10% of the overall group (one fourth of patients listed for transplantation) died on the waiting list. Other series have reported death rates of those listed for transplant as high as 40%.
In the ALFSG, the transplantation rate was higher in the groups with lower short-term spontaneous survival, making overall survival similar in all groups: acetaminophen, 73%; drug induced, 70%; indeterminate group, 64%; and other causes,61%. Causes of death for the 101 patients who died within the 3-week period included cerebral edema, multiorgan failure, sepsis, cardiac arrhythmia or arrest and respiratory failure. The median time to death after admission was 5 days.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Acetylcysteine===

Intravenous [[N-acetylcysteine]] has been found to be beneficial in both [[acetaminophen toxicity]] and non-acetaminophen-related acute liver failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee WM, Hynan LS, Rossaro L |title=Intravenous N-acetylcysteine improves transplant-free survival in early stage non-acetaminophen acute liver failure |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=137 |issue=3 |pages=856–64, 864.e1 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19524577 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2009.06.006 |url= |pmc=3189485|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==

Historically mortality has been high, being in excess of 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rakela J, Lange SM, Ludwig J, Baldus WP |title=Fulminant hepatitis: Mayo Clinic experience with 34 cases |journal=Mayo Clin. Proc. |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=289–92 |year=1985 |pmid=3921780 |doi=10.1016/s0025-6196(12)60534-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years the advent of liver transplantation and multidisciplinary intensive care support have improved survival significantly. At present overall short-term survival with transplant is more than 65%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ostapowicz G, Fontana RJ, Schiødt FV |title=Results of a prospective study of acute liver failure at 17 tertiary care centers in the United States |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=137 |issue=12 |pages=947–54 |year=2002 |pmid=12484709 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-137-12-200212170-00007|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several prognostic scoring systems have been devised to predict mortality and to identify who will require an early liver transplant. These include [[King's College Hospital criteria]], [[Model for End-Stage Liver Disease|MELD score]], [[APACHE II]], and [[Clichy criteria]].

== Terminology ==

To date, no universally accepted nomenclature has been adopted. Trey and Davidson introduced the phrase ''fulminant hepatic failure'' in 1970, which they described as a "...&amp;nbsp;potentially reversible condition, the consequence of severe liver injury, with an onset of [[Hepatic encephalopathy|encephalopathy]] within 8 weeks of the appearance of the first symptoms and in the absence of pre-existing liver disease".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trey C, Davidson CS |title=The management of fulminant hepatic failure |journal=Progress in liver diseases |volume=3 |issue= |pages=282–98 |year=1970 |pmid=4908702 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it was suggested that the term ''fulminant'' should be confined to patients who develop jaundice to encephalopathy within 2 weeks. Phrases ''subfulminant'' hepatic failure and ''late onset' hepatic failure were coined for onset between 2 weeks to 3 months and for 8 weeks to 24 weeks, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernuau J, Goudeau A, Poynard T |title=Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors in fulminant hepatitis B |journal=Hepatology |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=648–51 |year=1986 |pmid=3732998 |doi=10.1002/hep.1840060417|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gimson AE, O'Grady J, Ede RJ, Portmann B, Williams R |title=Late onset hepatic failure: clinical, serological and histological features |journal=Hepatology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=288–94 |year=1986 |pmid=3082735 |doi=10.1002/hep.1840060222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The umbrella phrase of ''acute liver failure'' was proposed by King's College group, which has been adopted in this article. Paradoxically, in this classification, the best prognosis is in the ''hyperacute'' group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sass DA, Shakil AO |title=Fulminant hepatic failure |journal=Liver Transpl. |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=594–605 |year=2005 |pmid=15915484 |doi=10.1002/lt.20435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adolf''' (c. 1255 –  2 July 1298) was [[House of Nassau|Count of Nassau]] from about 1276 and elected [[List of German monarchs|King of Germany]] ([[King of the Romans]]) from 1292 until his deposition by the [[prince-elector]]s in 1298. He was  never crowned by the Pope, which would have secured him the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. He was the first physically and mentally healthy ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ever to be deposed without a papal [[excommunication]]. Adolf died shortly afterwards in the [[Battle of Göllheim]] fighting against his successor [[Albert I of Germany|Albert of Habsburg]].

He was the second in the succession of so-called [[count-kings]] of several rivalling comital houses striving after the Roman-German royal dignity.

His last agnatic dynastic descendant was [[William IV of Luxembourg]].

==Family==
Adolf was the reigning count of a small German state.  He was born about 1255 and was the son of [[Walram II, Count of Nassau]] and Adelheid of [[County of Katzenelnbogen|Katzenelnbogen]]. Adolf’s brother was {{Interlanguage link multi|Dieter of Nassau|de|3=Diether von Nassau}}, who was appointed [[Archbishopric of Trier|Archbishop of Trier]] in 1300.

Adolf was married in 1270 to [[Imagina of Isenburg-Limburg]] (died after 1313) and they had eight children.  Agnes of Isenburg-Limburg, the sister of Imagina, was married to Henry (Heinrich) of Westerburg, the brother of [[Siegfried II of Westerburg]], the [[List of bishops and archbishops of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]].

==Career as Count of Nassau==
In 1276 or 1277, Adolf followed his father as Count of Nassau.   From his father, he inherited the family’s lands south of the [[Lahn]] River in the [[Taunus]] Mountains. These included [[Wiesbaden]] and [[Idstein]], as [[fiefdom]]s, and the [[Vogt]]ship in [[Weilburg]] under the [[Bishopric of Worms]]. He also shared ownership of the family homelands around the castles of [[Nassau, Germany|Nassau]] and [[Laurenburg]].

Around 1280, Adolf became involved in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Nassau-Eppstein Feud|de|3=Nassauisch-Eppsteinische Fehde}} with the [[Lords of Eppstein]], in which the city of Wiesbaden was devastated and [[Wiesbaden-Sonnenberg|Sonnenberg]] Castle destroyed. The feud was settled in 1283, after which the city and the castle were rebuilt. Sonnenberg, along with Idstein, became Adolf’s residence. He granted Idstein [[German town law|town privileges]] in 1287 and built its fortifications.

Through his uncle, Eberhard I of Katzenelnbogen, Adolf came to the court of King [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolf I]] of [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]]. King Rudolf awarded him with the Burghauptmannamt (Castle Lordship) of Kalsmunt Castle in [[Wetzlar]] and a year later that of [[Burg Gutenfels|Gutenfels Castle]] near [[Kaub]] (where he became a vassal of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Counts Palatine of the Rhine]]).

Before his election, Adolf’s political activities had been limited to his role as Bundesgenosse of the Archbishop of Cologne. Adolf had no particular office, but likely became known through his involvement with the Archbishops of Cologne and [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]] in the politics of the [[Middle Rhine]] and Mainz areas. He spoke [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], and [[Latin]], which was rare at that time for nobles.

After his election, King Adolf of Nassau would only rarely be in his home country, having transferred the government there to his burgmen. On  17 January 1294, he purchased Weilburg for 400 pounds from the Bishopric of Worms. He granted Weilburg town privileges on  29 December 1295. He also established the [[Order of Poor Ladies|Clarisse]] abbey of [[Klarenthal Abbey|Klarenthal]] near Wiesbaden in 1296.

==Election as King of the Romans==
[[File:Adolf von nassau montanus.JPG|thumb|Portrait by Arnold Montanus, 1662]]

Rudolf I of Habsburg died on 15 July 1291. For many years before his death, Rudolf had tried to secure the election of his eldest son [[Albert I of Habsburg|Albert]] (Albrecht) as his successor. He was thwarted, however, by the opposition of the Archbishop of Cologne, Siegfried II of Westerburg, and the [[List of rulers of Bohemia|King of Bohemia]], [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus (''Václav/Wenzel'') II]]. Only the Count Palatine [[Louis II, Duke of Bavaria|Louis II]] of [[Upper Bavaria]] "the Rigorous" promised to choose Albert. Wenceslaus, despite Rudolf's recognition of his electoral vote, refused to support Albert because he would not cede [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] to him. He took the side of the nobles in the core Habsburg areas of [[Swabia]] and in their newly acquired territories in [[Austria]], with whom Albert was unpopular. Wenceslaus was supported by Duke [[Otto III, Duke of Bavaria|Otto III of Lower Bavaria]], whose family were traditional enemies of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]].&lt;ref&gt;Herde (1995), pp. 515-516&lt;/ref&gt; Wenceslaus succeeded in bringing the Electors of Brandenburg and Saxony over to his side: [[Albert II, Duke of Saxony|Albert II of Saxony]] signed an elector pact on 29 November 1291 that he would vote the same as Wenceslaus; [[List of rulers of Brandenburg|Otto IV of Brandenburg]] made a similar commitment.

Archbishop Siegfried believed that the Emperor should not receive the crown as an inheritance from his father, but should be freely selected by the College of Electors. He convinced the [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Archbishop of Mainz]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Gerard II of Eppstein|de|3=Gerhard II. von Eppstein}}, to select a king who would principally serve their interests. Gerard in turn recruited the new [[Archbishopric of Trier|Archbishop of Trier]], [[Bohemond I (Archbishop of Trier)|Bohemund I]]. Thereupon, the Count Palatine was forced to submit to the majority of the College of Electors. Siegfried therefore proposed to the Elector College to select Adolf of Nassau as king. They were ready to elect him, provided he make extensive concessions to the Electors and follow their political demands.

A few days before the election, on 27 April 1292, the first of the electors, Archbishop Siegfried issued the [[Treaty of Andernach (1292)|Treaty of Andernach]], stating that for Adolf to be chosen king he must promise a long list of acknowledgments of possession (including the imperial cities of [[Dortmund]] and [[Duisburg]], and the Vogtship of [[Essen]]), pledges of imperial cities and castles, and a sum of 25,000 marks in silver. Furthermore, Adolf promised assistance against specifically listed opponents, but also the general promise that he would not admit any enemy of Siegfried II into his council. After the election, Adolf had to give the archbishop sufficient collateral for the fulfilment of the promise; otherwise he would lose his throne. The last clause is evidence of the fact that the end of the 13th century, the coronation of the king as the constitutive moment of his rule was still very critical. Adolf promised the archbishop to ask him first for his coronation when he had raised the agreed-upon collateral.

The other electors extracted similar concessions from Adolf, but only after the election. Among the most far-reaching were the concessions to King Wenceslaus of Bohemia on 30 June 1292. Adolf promised Wenceslaus to remove the two duchies of [[Austria]] and [[Styria]] from Albert of Habsburg. This was to be done as the previous King Rudolf had removed these territories from King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]], the father of Wenceslaus. Albert would be charged to agree to this arrangement at a court hearing. If Albert would not bend, the decision of the court would be executed by force within a year. Wenceslaus would then recover the lost territories of his father. Gerhard, the Archbishop of Mainz would receive the imperial cities of [[Mühlhausen]] and [[Nordhausen]], which corresponded with the interests of Mainz in the [[Thuringia]]n region. Furthermore, Gerhard received financial benefits. Like his counterpart in Cologne, the Mainz elector also forbade the presence of his opponents in Adolf’s court. In comparison to the benefits the Mainz, Cologne and Bohemian electors received, the donations to the Count Palatine and the Archbishop of Trier were modest.

On 5 May 1292 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], the Archbishop of Mainz, in the name of all the electors, elected Adolf [[List of German monarchs|King of the Germans]] (Emperor-Elect).&lt;ref name="Herde 1995. p. 516"&gt;Herde (1995). p. 516.&lt;/ref&gt; He was crowned in [[Aachen]] on 24 June by the Archbishop of Cologne.

==Reign==
[[Image:Adolf of Nassau-Weilburg 1255 - 1298.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Part of the image of King Adolf in the Frankfurt Hall of Kings]]Adolf had neither influence nor power, and was elected ''Rex Romanorum'' because of the electors' preference for a weak king. His power was limited from the outset because of the commitments he made.

As he had agreed with the Archbishop of Cologne, Adolf remained in his dominion for four months after his election. The archbishop awaited from the king a revision of the results of the [[Battle of Worringen]] in 1288. He had hoped to again win a greater influence in the city of [[Cologne]]. But despite the tight specifications, Adolf soon emancipated himself from his Electors and concluded pacts with their opponents. Thus, for example, he confirmed the rights of the nobles and the city of Cologne, who had turned against their ruler, and even extended these rights.

Adolf also very quickly broke the promises concerning the Duchies of [[Austria]] and [[Styria]]. As a clever diplomat, Albert of Habsburg avoided a confrontation with the new king. In exchange for his surrender of the [[Imperial Regalia]], which he still had in his possession, he received, in November 1292 a formal enfeoffment with Austria, Styria, the [[Windic March]], and the Lordship of [[Pordenone]]. The disposition of the prestigious insignia and relics of the empire was an additional and important sign for the legitimacy of the reign of the king, but not a mandatory prerequisite. With each new document, Adolf moved a little farther away from his promises, without having to open himself up to breach of contract accusations.

Adolf acted as a self-assured ruler in other ways as well. His court was an attraction for all who sought protection from the powerful emerging territorial lords. He held numerous court days. At the beginning of his reign, he renewed the general public peace (''Landfrieden'') of Rudolf I for another ten years, and brought about at least two regional peaces.

Adolf used the [[feudalism|feudal system]] as one of his major tools of power. He demanded from the spiritual princes a payment, called ''Lehnsware'', for their enfeoffment with [[regalian right]]s, and increased this demand to the level of a nuisance. Many of Adolf’s contemporaries considered this action to be [[simony]]. Many of today's historians, however, view it as an innovative way to open up new state revenue sources, as other Western European kings did. Also, the recovery and management of imperial property was important to him. So he succeeded, through clever marriage policy, to bring former imperial properties back under the control of the emperor.

===Alliance with England===
In 1294, when Adolf’s rule was at its height, he concluded an alliance with the King [[Edward I of England]] against [[France]] and was awarded 60,000 pounds sterling, which corresponded to 90,000 gold marks. The pact had been preceded by attempts by [[Philip IV of France]] to conquer the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] and the [[County of Flanders]]. The Count of Flanders, [[Guy of Dampierre]], mediated, therefore, the alliance between Edward I and Adolf for his protection against France. That the alliance was construed by his contemporaries as purely mercenary, and the fact that Adolf did not comply with its obligations, damaged his reputation, but this was initially without consequences.

Adolf began recruiting troops in the empire for a war against France. On  31 August 1294, he sent a declaration of war to the French king, alleging he had seized rights and possessions of the empire. King Philip responded contemptuously on  9 March 1295.&lt;ref&gt;Herde (1995), p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Boniface VIII]], however, ordered peace in 1295 and threatened to commence the [[excommunication]] of Adolf in the event of an outbreak of war.

===Policies in Thuringia===
A little later Adolf intervened in war-torn [[Thuringia]], where fighting had erupted between Landgrave [[Albert II, Margrave of Meissen|Albert the Degenerate]] and his sons [[Frederick I, Margrave of Meissen|Frederick]] and [[Theodoric IV, Landgrave of Lusatia|Theodoric IV]] of [[March of Lusatia|Lusatia]]. He bought the Landgraviate from Albert in his capacity as king and probably using the payments from England. Legally, it was perfectly acceptable for Adolf to induce the feudal lord to abandon his fief and to bring the land under the empire. Furthermore, he seized the Margraviate of Meissen as an imperial fief, since it had been literally ownerless after the extinction of a collateral line of the [[House of Wettin]] and had been occupied by a son of Albert the Degenerate.

This purchase and the [[Margraviate of Meissen]], however, affected the interests of four of the electors. The Archbishop of Mainz asserted that a part of Thuringia was not an imperial fief, but rather a fief of the Archdiocese of Mainz. Wenceslaus II of Bohemia was not thrilled by the growing power of the emperor on his northern border, especially since Adolf had promised to give him the Margraviate of Meissen. Also, all the electors hoped to profit from the turmoil in Thuringia. In addition to the ostensible return of imperial fiefs to the empire, it can not be ruled out that Adolf was anxious to build a dynastic power base (albeit a small one).

First, Adolf succeeded in securing his acquisitions diplomatically and provoking the Margrave of Brandenburg toward active support and the Archbishop of Mainz and the Duke of Saxony toward at least acquiescence of the purchase. Two bloody campaigns against the sons of Albert the Degenerate were necessary to secure the acquisitions and a peace assured the achievements. Two years later, in the summer of 1296, Adolf proudly announced on the invitation to a court day that he had by his actions significantly increased the possessions of the empire.

==Deposition as King==
[[Image:Absetzung Adolfs und Wahl Albrechts I.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Deposition of Adolf and Election of Albert, illustration from the Chronicles of the Bishops of Würzburg]]The electors probably did not plan from the beginning to depose the king, but as  events unfolded this result became more inevitable. The reason for the clashes was Adolf’s Thuringia policy. On [[Pentecost]] 1297 the Elector of Brandenburg, Duke of Saxony, and King of Bohemia joined together to enforce their interests. The Elector of Cologne, Gerhard II, was associated with this group.

In February 1298, the situation became alarming for Adolf because Wenceslaus II and Albert of Habsburg put aside their years of disputes over Austria and Styria, and reached an agreement in the event that Adolf was deposed and Albert elected in his place. There may have been a meeting of the electors as early as the coronation of King Wenceslaus of Bohemia, on  2 June 1297. In January 1298, through the efforts of the Archbishop of Mainz, Albert of Habsburg was brought to testify before an imperial court in order to find a compromise between Adolf and Albert. This did not happen; the two came close to battle in the Upper Rhine Valley and the matter was not resolved.

On 1 May 1298, the Archbishop of Mainz invited the king to his court, so that the dispute could be decided there. Archbishop Gerhard claimed he was authorised to do so as imperial arch-chancellor of Germany, according to an old legal principle.&lt;ref&gt;Herde (1995), p. 518.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the King, as a party to the conflict, could not at the same time act as judge and saw these charges as a provocation given that Albert was raising arms against him, the rightful king. Therefore, the meeting planned for 15 June, at which the dispute was to be resolved, did not take place.

A meeting between the Archbishop of Mainz, Count Albrecht of Saxony-Wittenberg, and three Margraves of Brandenburg on  23 June 1298 then led to a lawsuit against the king himself. The Archbishop of Cologne and the King of Bohemia had previously authorised the Archbishop of Mainz to act in their names. In these proceedings Adolf was charged with numerous crimes, including the continued breach of the peace in Thuringia and the breaking of the promises he had made to the Archbishop of Mainz. Adolf was deemed unworthy of his office and had forfeited his royal dignity.

It is remarkable that Adolf was not excommunicated by the Pope before being deposed. The pope was probably not even included in the deposition procedure. The princes, it is true, did try to formulate their arguments similar to Innocent IV’s statement in the deposition of Frederick II, but the process was unheard of for this time. Because Adolf had been elected and crowned, the contemporary understanding was that he had been chosen by God to be the ruler and that the princes were breaking their oath in which they swore loyalty to the king. Therefore, included in the list of charges were some that, at first glance, appear peculiar today, such as the desecration of communion wafers and the simonistic extortion of money. Furthermore, there was no imperial legal procedure for the ousting of the king. Therefore, the princes relied on their right to vote, from which also they derived their right to oust a king. This argument was problematic insofar as the deposition of Frederick II was already a precedent for this case. According to church law, only the Pope had the power to depose a king.

==Election of Albert and Death of Adolf==
[[Image:Tod Adolf von Nassau.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Depiction of Adolf’s death at the Battle of Göllheim, by Master Simon, Koblenz, 1829]]

Following Adolf’s deposition came the election of [[Albert I of Habsburg]] as the new king. How this election took place is not very clear today, as the chroniclers have little to report. The question is open, for example, whether Albert actually initially did not want to accept the choice, as he would later assert against [[Pope Boniface VIII]].

To depose Adolf was one thing; it was another to enforce the decision against him. Adolf refused to accept this decision, but the conflict between him and the princely opposition was soon decided on the battlefield. On 2 July 1298 the armies of Adolf and Albert met at the [[Battle of Göllheim]]. The small village of [[Göllheim]] is situated in northern [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] between [[Kaiserslautern]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in present-day [[Donnersbergkreis]]. After violent attacks, Adolf fell together with his standard-bearers and a few faithful. Adolf’s army turned to flee and quickly dispersed.

Albert did not allow the followers of Adolf to bury the body of the fallen king in the ''Kaiserdom'', the [[Speyer Cathedral|Imperial Cathedral of Speyer]]. Therefore, Adolf was initially buried in the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery of {{Interlanguage link multi|Rosenthal Abbey|de|3=Kloster Rosenthal (Pfalz)}} in present-day [[Kerzenheim]] and was only later transferred to Speyer.

==Historical legacy==
[[Image:Speyer adolf von nassau denkmal.jpg|thumb|right|250px|19th-century monument to Adolf from the vestibule of Speyer Cathedral]]

On  29 August 1309, Albert I’s successor, Emperor [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] transferred Adolf’s remains to the Speyer Cathedral, where he was buried next to Albert, who had been murdered in 1308. In 1824, [[William, Duke of Nassau|Duke William of Nassau]] built a grave monument in the vestibule of the cathedral. Leo von Klenze was commissioned with the design, which shows King Adolf in armor kneeling in prayer.

Probably in the 19th century, the legend arose that Adolf was a count from the Nuremberg area. This misconception was probably based on confusion with Emich I of Nassau-Hadamar, who after his marriage to Anne of Nuremberg around 1300 was the holder of Kammerstein Castle.

In 1841 Duke Adolf of Nassau commissioned a portrait of Adolf by the Düsseldorf painter Heinrich Mücke. In 1843 this painting was hung in the Frankfurt ''Kaisersaal'' (Hall of Kings). The picture depicts King Adolf with chest armor, a white coat; and wearing an iron crown with an "implied spiked helmet”; in his right hand he holds a sword and in the left a shield with an eagle. It also bears the Latin phrase "Praestat vir sine pecunia quam pecunia sine viro" (Better a man without money than money without a man). Since no contemporary images of the King exist, the portrait is an idealized representation by the artist in the spirit of historicism. It is not based on previous portraits, since Mücke considered other representations, such as the one attributed to Georg Friedrich Christian Seekatz, to be too moderate&lt;ref&gt;Even (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

On  8 May 1858, Duke Adolf of Nassau established a [[Order of Adolphe of Nassau|Military and Civil Order of Merit]] for the Duchy. It was named for King Adoph as the most important representative of Walram line of the House of Nassau. Although the Duchy of Nassau was annexed by Prussia in 1866, Duke Adolf maintained and renewed the Order when he became Grand Duke of Luxembourg. Until today, it is a respected Order of Merit of the House of Nassau.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Scoos: Orden und Ehrenzeichen in Herzogtum Nassau 1806–1866 (Orders and decorations in the Duchy of Nassau 1806-1866), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Carlyle]] calls him "a stalwart but necessitous Herr".

==Marriage and children==
He married [[Imagina of Isenburg-Limburg]], daughter of [[Gerlach IV of Isenburg-Limburg]] and Imagina of Blieskastel. Their children were:
# Henry (''Heinrich''), died young.
# Robert (''Ruprecht'') (died  2 December 1304), betrothed to Agnes, daughter of [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]]&lt;ref name="Herde 1995. p. 516"/&gt;
# [[Gerlach I, Count of Nassau-Wiesbaden]].
# Adolf (1292–1294).
# [[Walram III of Nassau-Wiesbaden]].
# Adelheid, Abbess of [[Klarenthal Abbey]], died 26 May 1338.
# Imagina, died young.
# [[Mechtild of Nassau|Matilda]] (before 1280 – 19 June 1323, [[Heidelberg]]), married [[Rudolf I, Duke of Bavaria|Rudolf I "the Stammerer", Duke of Upper Bavaria]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3522">Saint '''Arn''' or '''Arno von Endsee''' (died 13 July 892) was the [[Bishop of Würzburg]] from 855 until his death. He was a pupil of [[Gozbald, Bishop of Würzburg|Bishop Gozbald]], who died on 20 September 855; Arn was elected bishop in his place.&lt;ref&gt;AF, 855 (p. 37 and n1).&lt;/ref&gt; Arn was a warrior-prelate, recorded fighting against almost every external foe of the Germans at one point in his career or another.

In his first year in office, the cathedral of [[Würzburg]] was destroyed by lightning and Arn had to rebuild it. He was an active participator in the East Frankish government of [[Louis the German]] (who appointed him), [[Charles the Fat]], and [[Arnulf of Carinthia]].

In 871, [[Louis the German]] held an assembly at [[Frankfurt]] and from there sent Arn and [[Ruodolt, Margrave of the Nordgau]], to defend the border between the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] and [[Great Moravia]] because he had heard that the Moravians were planning an invasion. The Moravians had constructed a very large, circular wall to force the Germans through a very narrow opening and thus cut them off from fleeing. Arn, however, aware of the trap, caught a Moravian army leading back a Bohemian bride offguard and forced it into the trap.&lt;ref&gt;AF, 871 (p. 66&amp;67).&lt;/ref&gt; The Moravian were forced to abandon their horses and flee on foot. In 872, however, he assisted [[Carloman of Bavaria]] against [[Svatopluk of Moravia]] and was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;AF, 872 (p. 68).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 884, Arn and [[Henry of Franconia]] led the forces of all [[East Francia]] against a [[Viking]] army invading [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and were victorious.&lt;ref&gt;AF(M), 884 (p. 95).&lt;/ref&gt; In 892, Arn, on the advice of [[Poppo, Duke of Thuringia]], had undertaken an expedition against the [[Sorbs|Wends]] and was killed, either during a [[mass (religion)|mass]] on the [[Chemnitz River|Chemnitz]] near [[Frankenburg am Hausruck|Frankenburg]] or, after withdrawing to [[Sandberg Celtic city|Sandberg]] (perhaps [[Wiederau]] or [[Taurastein]]), in a decisive battle with the Slavs.&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, 124 n9. Some sources make him murdered ''after'' the battle was lost.&lt;/ref&gt; Poppo was deposed from his office for his poor counsel and Arn was replaced by [[Rudolf I, Bishop of Würzburg|Rudolf]], a member of the [[Conradine]] family.

He is buried in St-Aegidien in [[Colditz]] and was immediately reckoned a martyr. He was finally [[canonised]] in the 18th century. Around 1250, a chapel was built in his honour at [[Mittweida]].

'''Bertram Thomas Combs''' (August 13, 1911 – December 4, 1991) was an American [[judge|jurist]] and politician from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Kentucky]]. After serving on the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]], he was elected the [[List of Governors of Kentucky|50th]] [[Governor of Kentucky]] in 1959 on his second run for the office. Following his gubernatorial term, he was appointed to serve as a [[United States federal judge|United States Circuit Judge]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], serving from 1967 to 1970.

Combs rose from poverty in his native [[Clay County, Kentucky|Clay County]] to obtain a law degree from the [[University of Kentucky]] and open a law practice in [[Prestonsburg, Kentucky|Prestonsburg]]. He was [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|decorated]] for prosecuting [[Japanese war crimes|Japanese war criminals]] before [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|military tribunals]] following [[World War II]], then returned to Kentucky and his law practice. In 1951, Governor [[Lawrence Wetherby]] appointed him to fill a vacancy on the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Later that year, he was elected to a full term on the court, defeating former governor and judge [[Simeon S. Willis]]. Kentucky's [[Kentucky Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] had split into two factions by 1955 when [[Earle C. Clements]], the leader of one faction, chose Combs to challenge former governor and U.S. Senator [[Happy Chandler|A. B. "Happy" Chandler]], who headed the other, in the upcoming gubernatorial primary. 

Combs' uninspiring speeches and candidness about the need for more state revenue cost him the [[primary election]]. Chandler, who went on to reclaim the governorship, had promised that he would not need to raise taxes to meet the state's financial obligations, but ultimately he did so. This damaged Chandler's credibility and left Combs looking courageous and honest in the eyes of the electorate. Consequently, in 1959 Combs was elected governor, defeating Lieutenant Governor [[Harry Lee Waterfield]], Chandler's choice to succeed him in office, in the primary. Early in his term, Combs secured passage of a three-percent [[sales tax]] to pay a bonus to the state's military veterans. Knowing a tax of one percent would have been sufficient, he used the excess revenue to enact a system of reforms, including expansion of the state's [[List of primary state highways in Kentucky|highway]] and [[List of Kentucky state parks|state park]] systems. He also devoted much of the surplus to [[Education in Kentucky|education]].

Following his term in office, Combs was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit by President Johnson. He served for three years before resigning and running for governor again in 1971. He [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 1971|lost]] in the Democratic primary to [[Wendell Ford]], his former executive secretary. In 1984, Combs agreed to represent sixty-six of the state's poor school districts in a lawsuit challenging the state's system of financing public education. The suit, ''Rose v. Council for Better Education'', resulted in the [[Kentucky Supreme Court]] declaring the state's entire system of public schools unconstitutional. In response, the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] drafted a sweeping education measure known as the [[Kentucky Education Reform Act#Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA)|Kentucky Education Reform Act]] in 1991. On December 3, 1991, Combs was caught in a [[flash flood]] while driving and was killed.

==Early life==
The Combs family was one of the oldest European families in the United States. John Combs, the family patriarch, arrived in [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in 1619, and in 1775 Benjamin John Combs came westward from [[Virginia]] into [[Clark County, Kentucky]]. He was followed into Kentucky in 1790 by two of his brothers, including Jack Combs, Bert Combs' great-grandfather.&lt;ref name=pearce56&gt;Pearce, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Bert Combs was born in the Town Branch section of [[Manchester, Kentucky]] on August 13, 1911; he was one of seven children of Stephen Gibson and Martha (Jones) Combs.&lt;ref name=lhl&gt;"Combs Rose to Pinnacle From Plain Beginnings"&lt;/ref&gt; Combs's father Stephen, a part-time [[logging|logger]] and farmer, was active in local politics, despite being a [[Kentucky Democratic Party|Democrat]] in a county where a large majority of residents were [[Republican Party of Kentucky|Republican]]s.&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt; His mother was a teacher, and she impressed upon her children the importance of a good education.&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt; Bert's first school was the two-room Beech Creek [[Elementary school (United States)|grade school]].&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt; When he reached the seventh grade, his parents sent him and his sister to [[Oneida Baptist Institute]] in nearby [[Oneida, Kentucky|Oneida]] because its school term was 8 to 9 months long, as opposed to the 5- to 6-month terms at Beech Creek.&lt;ref name=robinson9&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Combs and his sister began riding a donkey every day to [[Clay County High School]].&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt; Combs excelled academically and [[grade skipping|skipped some grades]], graduating as [[valedictorian]] of his class in 1927 at age 15.&lt;ref name=robinson10&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to afford college tuition, Combs worked at a local drug store and did small jobs for various residents of his community.&lt;ref name="robinson10"/&gt; In 1929, his mother arranged for him to work at a coal company in [[Williamsburg, Kentucky|Williamsburg]] and attend [[University of the Cumberlands|Cumberland College]] (then a [[junior college#United States|junior college]]).&lt;ref name="robinson10"/&gt; The coal company job did not materialize, but Combs was able to afford three semesters at Cumberland by sweeping floors and firing furnaces in campus buildings.&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson11&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1930, he began working as a clerk for the state highway department.&lt;ref name=ukaa&gt;"Bert T. Combs". Hall of Distinguished Alumni.&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of several [[spoils system|patronage]] jobs that were usually awarded by the governor, but the Democratically-controlled [[Kentucky General Assembly|state legislature]] had stripped Republican Governor [[Flem D. Sampson]] of his statutory appointment powers, giving them instead to a three-man highway commission composed of Democratic [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|Lieutenant Governor]] [[James Breathitt, Jr.|James Breathitt]], Democratic Highway Commissioner [[Ben Johnson (politician)|Ben Johnson]], and Dan Talbott.&lt;ref name=robinson12&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed Combs, a Democrat, to secure the position.&lt;ref name=robinson8&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Combs worked for the highway department for three years in order to earn enough money to attend the [[University of Kentucky College of Law]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]].&lt;ref name=ukaa/&gt; While at the university, he was managing editor of the ''Kentucky Law Journal''.&lt;ref name=ukaa/&gt; In 1937 he graduated second in his class, earning a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree and qualifying for the [[Order of the Coif]], a national [[honor society]] for the top ten percent of graduating law students.&lt;ref name=ukaa/&gt;&lt;ref name=nga&gt;"Kentucky Governor Bert Thomas Combs". National Governors Association.&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]], and returned to Manchester to begin practicing law.&lt;ref name=ho6&gt;"Bertram Thomas Combs (1911–1991)". History of the Sixth Circuit&lt;/ref&gt; It was also in 1937 that Combs married Mabel Hall, with whom he had two children, [[Lois Combs Weinberg|Lois Ann Combs]] and Thomas "Tommy" George Combs.&lt;ref name=kye217&gt;Harrison, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early legal career and service in World War II==
Of his law practice in Manchester, Combs later noted: "I had too many kinfolks and friends in Manchester, and they all expected me to handle things as a favor&amp;nbsp;... Then they'd get their feelings hurt if I charged them. I was taking in a lot of cases, but not sending out many bills."&lt;ref name=pearce58&gt;Pearce, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, Combs accepted an offer from a law school classmate named LeRoy Combs (no relation) to join his father and uncle's law firm in [[Prestonsburg, Kentucky|Prestonsburg]].&lt;ref name=robinson16&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Prestonsburg was closer to his wife's home in [[Knott County, Kentucky|Knott County]].&lt;ref name=robinson16/&gt; Combs' son Tommy suffered from a form of [[mental retardation]], the result of an injury sustained at birth.&lt;ref name=kypost&gt;"Bert Combs Missing, Feared Dead". ''The Kentucky Post''&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to Prestonsburg, Combs started a class for people with mental retardation, in part so Tommy could attend the class.&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt;

On December 22, 1943, Combs enlisted as a [[private (rank)|private]] in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] for service in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=harmon27&gt;Harmon, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; He received his basic training at [[Fort Knox]] and participated in the Volunteer Officer Candidate Program, which would have allowed him to attend [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Army)|Officer Candidate School]] (OCS) immediately after basic training.&lt;ref name=robinson16/&gt;&lt;ref name=harmon27/&gt; Instead, he was briefly assigned to teach [[cartography]] at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] in [[Aberdeen, Maryland]] before completing OCS in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], joining the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps]], and attaining the rank of [[Captain (United States)|captain]].&lt;ref name=nga/&gt;&lt;ref name=harmon27/&gt; On July 1, 1945, he was sent to the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South Pacific]].&lt;ref name=harmon27/&gt; He served as chief of the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East#Background|War Crimes Investigating Department]] under General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)#Japanese occupation and World War II (1941–45)|Philippine Islands]], conducting tribunals for [[Japanese war crimes|Japanese war criminals]].&lt;ref name=nga/&gt; Upon his discharge in 1946, he was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] and the [[Military Merit Medal (Philippines)|Military Merit Medal of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=ukaa/&gt;&lt;ref name=ho6/&gt;

After the war, Combs returned to Prestonsburg, forming the law firm of Howard and Combs with J. Woodford Howard as his partner.&lt;ref name=ho6/&gt;&lt;ref name=kygovs196&gt;Robinson in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; He served as president of the Junior Bar Association of Kentucky in 1946 and 1947.&lt;ref name=ukaa/&gt; Combs often represented coal companies in [[workers' compensation]] cases against [[Carl D. Perkins]], later a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]], who served as legal counsel for the mine workers.&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt;

==Political career==
Combs began his political career with his election to the office of [[city attorney]] in Prestonsburg in 1950.&lt;ref name=jusc&gt;"Combs, Bertram Thomas". ''History of the Sixth Circuit''&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Governor [[Lawrence Wetherby]] appointed him to fill a vacancy in the office of [[Commonwealth's Attorney]] for Kentucky's 31st Judicial District.&lt;ref name=jusc/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson20&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Combs announced, however, that he would serve only until a new election could be held.&lt;ref name=robinson20/&gt; In April 1951, Governor Wetherby appointed Combs to fill a vacancy on the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]] caused by the death of Judge Roy Helm.&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt; Later that year, he sought a full eight-year term on the court.&lt;ref name=pearce59&gt;Pearce, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; His opponent was [[Simeon S. Willis]], a popular former Republican governor who had previously sat on the court.&lt;ref name=pearce59/&gt; Combs won the election by a vote of 73,298 to 69,379.&lt;ref name=pearce59/&gt; In George Robinson's oral history, Combs attributed his victory to Willis's advanced age (68) and the fact that many of Willis' supporters assumed that their candidate would win and did not vote.&lt;ref name=robinson22&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===1955 gubernatorial race===
[[Happy Chandler|A.B. "Happy" Chandler]], who had served as Kentucky's governor from 1935 to 1939 and was a leader of a faction of the state's Democratic Party, announced his intention to seek a second term in 1955. Members of the anti-Chandler faction scrambled to find a candidate to oppose him. The most likely candidate was [[Emerson Beauchamp|Emerson "Doc" Beauchamp]], the sitting lieutenant governor, but Beauchamp was not a good campaigner and his ties to [[Logan County, Kentucky|Logan County]] &amp;ndash; where politics were dominated by sometimes-corrupt [[political boss]]es &amp;ndash; gave the anti-Chandler faction pause. Instead, the leader of the faction, former governor and sitting [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Earle C. Clements]], selected Combs as the faction's nominee, and Combs resigned from his position on the Court of Appeals to enter the race.&lt;ref name=nhok403&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Happy Chandler - Harris and Ewing Crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Happy Chandler]], Combs' opponent in the 1955 gubernatorial race|alt=A black-and-white photo of a man in his fifties wearing a suit]]
In Combs' first speech of the [[primary election|primary]] campaign, he admitted that the state needed to raise $25&amp;nbsp;million (${{Inflation|US|25|1955}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) in new revenue and that a [[sales tax]] should be considered.&lt;ref name=kye217/&gt;&lt;ref name=nhok403/&gt; Chandler, the more experienced politician, attacked Combs for this suggestion, maintaining that an experienced governor like himself would not need to raise taxes to meet the state's obligations.&lt;ref name=kye217/&gt; Combs' speech was also attacked as dry and uninspiring, partly because he read it verbatim from prepared notes.&lt;ref name=nhok403/&gt; "And you said ''I'' couldn't give a speech," Doc Beauchamp later complained to Clements.&lt;ref name=nhok403/&gt; Hugh Morris, chief of the Louisville ''[[The Courier-Journal|Courier-Journal]]'''s [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] bureau, commented that "Combs opened and closed his campaign on the same night".&lt;ref name=pearce64&gt;Pearce, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

With little but Combs' inexperience to run against, Chandler portrayed Combs as a pawn of former governors Clements and Wetherby, whom he derisively nicknamed "Clementine" and "Wetherbine".&lt;ref name=nhok403/&gt; He accused both administrations of wasteful spending, specifically attacking the construction of the [[Kentucky Turnpike]] and [[Freedom Hall]] as unnecessary expenditures.&lt;ref name=nhok403/&gt; Some of Chandler's attacks were more personal in nature; he charged that when Clements was governor, he spent $20,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|20000|1955}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) on a new rug for his office, and that Wetherby had used African [[mahogany]] to panel his office, instead of "good, honest Kentucky wood".&lt;ref name=nhok403/&gt;&lt;ref name=pearce6162&gt;Pearce, pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; Though receipts later showed that carpeting for the entire first floor of the [[Kentucky State Capitol|capitol]] had cost only $2,700 and that Wetherby's paneling had been purchased from and installed by a Kentucky contractor, Chandler's charges remained effective at keeping the Combs campaign on the defensive.&lt;ref name=pearce6162/&gt;

Two weeks before the primary, Combs was endorsed by former [[Vice-President of the United States|Vice-President]] and native Kentuckian [[Alben W. Barkley]], but Combs felt the endorsement came too late to be much help.&lt;ref name=pearce65&gt;Pearce, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Chandler defeated Combs in the primary by a vote of 259,875 to 241,754 and went on to win his second term as governor.&lt;ref name=kye217/&gt; Combs returned to Prestonsburg, set up a [[savings and loan]] company, and re-established his law practice.&lt;ref name=pearce65/&gt; During the four years of Chandler's term, Combs accepted a number of speaking engagements, but otherwise remained out of the public eye.&lt;ref name=pearce66&gt;Pearce, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the state's need for funds compelled Chandler to raise the state sales tax and other taxes, despite his campaign promises not to do so.&lt;ref name=kygovs197&gt;Robinson in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Chandler lost credibility and Combs gained a reputation as a courageous, forthright, and honest politician for having acknowledged the state's financial need during the campaign.&lt;ref name=kygovs197/&gt;

===1959 gubernatorial race===
Barred by the [[Kentucky Constitution|state constitution]] from seeking consecutive terms, Chandler endorsed his lieutenant governor, [[Harry Lee Waterfield]], to succeed him.&lt;ref name=nhok406&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilson Wyatt]], who had managed [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1952|presidential campaign in 1952]], was the first anti-Chandler candidate to declare his intention to seek the governorship in the 1959 election, doing so on April 9, 1958.&lt;ref name=robinson72&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Wyatt received several endorsements from leaders in [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]], which contained his home city of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and was vehemently anti-Chandler.&lt;ref name=robinson72/&gt; Four days after Wyatt's announcement, Combs declared that he would again seek the office, and he was endorsed by Clements a week later.&lt;ref name=robinson72/&gt; For the remainder of 1958, the anti-Chandler faction's support remained split between Wyatt and Combs.&lt;ref name=robinson73&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1959, Clements held an all-night meeting at the Standiford Airport Hotel in Louisville in which he brokered a deal whereby Combs would run for governor and Wyatt for lieutenant governor.&lt;ref name=nhok407&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; Clements promised Wyatt his support in future political races.&lt;ref name=nhok407/&gt;

In the primary campaign against Waterfield, Combs attacked the Chandler administration.&lt;ref name=nhok407/&gt; He was especially critical of a rumor which held that Chandler had placed a two-percent assessment on state employees' salaries and had stored the funds in a [[Republic of Cuba (1902–59)|Cuban]] bank so they could not be traced.&lt;ref name=nhok407/&gt; According to the rumor, when [[Fidel Castro]] seized power during the [[Cuban Revolution]], the funds Chandler had deposited in Cuba were lost.&lt;ref name=nhok407/&gt; Chandler countered on Waterfield's behalf with charges that Combs was a "Clements parrot".&lt;ref name=nhok407/&gt; Combs succeeded in uniting the anti-Chandler base, and defeated Waterfield by 25,000 votes; he went on to win the governorship that fall, defeating Republican nominee [[John M. Robsion, Jr.]] by 180,093 votes.&lt;ref name=kye217/&gt; The victory margin was a record for a governor's race in Kentucky, and was the second highest margin of victory for any election in the state, trailing only [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 185,858-vote victory over [[Herbert Hoover]] in [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]].&lt;ref name=kye217/&gt;&lt;ref name=pearce97&gt;Pearce, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Combs was the first governor elected from [[Eastern Mountain Coal Fields|Eastern Kentucky]] since Flem D. Sampson in 1927, and was the first veteran of World War II to hold the office.&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt;&lt;ref name=powell104&gt;Powell, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor of Kentucky===
One of Combs' first official actions as governor was to call a special session of the legislature on December 19, 1959, to consider revising the state's constitution, which had been in effect since 1891. Calling a constitutional convention required that the General Assembly approve putting the issue of a convention on the ballot in two consecutive legislative sessions. The call then had to be approved by Kentucky voters. Despite near-universal agreement by legal scholars that the constitution was badly in need of updating, Kentucky voters had rejected calls for a constitutional convention in 1931 and 1947, and had only approved 19 amendments since 1891. Combs wanted to address the issue during his four-year term, hence the haste in calling the special legislative session. The General Assembly easily approved the call for a convention during the special legislative session and again during the subsequent regular legislative session in 1960. Combs signed the measure, and the question of a constitutional revision was put on the ballot in November 1960, when Kentucky voters defeated it by a margin of almost 18,000 votes. This was the closest Kentucky has come to replacing the 1891 constitution, which remains in effect today.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, pp. 102–103, 117, 157, 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"History of the Kentucky Unified Court System". Kentucky Court of Justice&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kentucky's first billion-dollar budget===
During the campaign, Combs had advocated a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive platform]] that included increased funding for education, highways, parks, industry, and airports.&lt;ref name=kygovs198&gt;Robinson in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after his election, he won approval for a three-percent sales tax to pay a bonus to military veterans, although he could have funded the bonuses with a one-percent tax.&lt;ref name=kye217/&gt; He had asked for the larger tax in order to fund his other priorities.&lt;ref name=kye217/&gt; As a result of the sales tax, Combs presided over the state's first billion-dollar budget.&lt;ref name=nhok408/&gt; One study showed that Kentucky doubled its per capita expenditures between 1957 and 1962, growing its appropriations faster than any other state.&lt;ref name=nhok408/&gt; Combs held large public relations events for each tax-funded project that was completed, declaring in dedication speeches that the sales tax had made the project possible.&lt;ref name=kygovs198/&gt;

[[File:Albert B. Chandler Hospital.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A red, four-story building with two eight-story towers rising above it|The Albert B. Chandler Hospital was completed with funds from Combs' first biennial budget.]]
In 1960, Kentucky had one of the highest [[High school dropouts in the United States|dropout]] rates in the nation, and ranked second only to [[Arkansas]] in the number of one-room schools.&lt;ref name=pearce106&gt;Pearce, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than half of the state's high school graduates attended college.&lt;ref name=pearce106/&gt; Many teachers educated in Kentucky sought higher salaries available in other states.&lt;ref name=pearce106/&gt; Combs' biennial budget, passed by the General Assembly in 1960, used money from the new sales tax to increase school funds by fifty percent and establish the state community college system (now the [[Kentucky Community and Technical College System]]).&lt;ref name=nhok408/&gt; It also increased funding for free textbooks by more than $3&amp;nbsp;million and allocated another $2&amp;nbsp;million to [[Vocational education in the United States|vocational education]].&lt;ref name=pearce121&gt;Pearce, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; It allocated over $5&amp;nbsp;million to the state universities for new buildings and another $10.5&amp;nbsp;million to fund completion of the [[Albert B. Chandler Hospital]], a facility at the [[University of Kentucky]] named in honor of Combs' political foe.&lt;ref name=pearce120&gt;Pearce, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

The state's roads were in poor condition when Combs became governor. The [[Automotive Safety Foundation]] found that two-thirds of Kentucky's federal roads were below standards for existing traffic demands.&lt;ref name=pearce106/&gt; It further found that twenty percent of the state's major city streets were inadequate, that another fifty-five percent would soon be inadequate due to increasing traffic, and that half of the state's secondary roads were unfit for modern industrial traffic.&lt;ref name=pearce106/&gt; To address these problems, Combs issued $100&amp;nbsp;million in [[government bond|bonds]] to increase funding for highways, appointing Earle Clements as state highway commissioner to oversee the correction of the road issues.&lt;ref name=nhok408/&gt;&lt;ref name=pearce106/&gt; One of the new roads, the [[Bert T. Combs Mountain Parkway|Mountain Parkway]], which connected Combs' native Eastern Kentucky to Central Kentucky, was later renamed the Bert T. Combs Mountain Parkway in Combs' honor.&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt; Because of generous funding in Combs' budget, Kentucky finished its portions of the [[Interstate Highway System]] much sooner than surrounding states such as Virginia and [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=pearce111&gt;Pearce, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Combs also won approval of a $10&amp;nbsp;million bond issue to benefit the [[List of Kentucky state parks|state parks]], which had poor lodging and few amenities. Combs combined the bond issue with $10&amp;nbsp;million in revenue bonds and effected major renovations at all 26 of the state's parks. Though his dreams of seeing privately owned tourist facilities spring up around the parks did not come to fruition, out-of-state tourism to Kentucky more than doubled during his administration, accounting for about sixty percent of state park visitors and fifty-three percent of the overnight visitations to the parks. Journalist John Ed Pearce recounts that Kentucky natives began to complain that they could not get reservations in the parks during peak seasons and called for limitations on the number of out-of-state visitors or a reservation system that favored Kentuckians, although nothing was done to address these complaints.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Floral Clock Frankfort KY.png|thumb|right|300px|alt=A large clock with flowers on the face that reads "Kentucky" and has an outline of the state in the middle|The [[Floral clock (Frankfort, Kentucky)|floral clock in Frankfort]]]]
On April 10, 1961, Combs appropriated $50,000 from the governor's contingency fund to construct a [[Floral clock (Frankfort, Kentucky)|floral clock]] on the lawn of the state capitol.&lt;ref name=pearce135&gt;Pearce, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Combs had seen a similar clock in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, and believed it would be a colorful addition to the capitol grounds.&lt;ref name=pearce135/&gt; In a subsequent gubernatorial campaign, Happy Chandler mocked the clock, declaring "Well, they don't say it's half past 2 in Frankfort anymore. They say it's two [[petunia]]s past the [[jimson weed]]."&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt; Chandler's derision became the minority view in time, however; according to John Ed Pearce, the clock became one of the most talked-about and visited tourist attractions in the state and the most visited place in Frankfort.&lt;ref name=pearce135/&gt;

===Ethical reforms===
Combs created a [[merit system]] for state government workers, ensuring that officials could not be hired or fired for political reasons.&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt; This provision attracted more well-qualified people to public service careers.&lt;ref name=kygovs198/&gt; Such careers were made even more attractive when, in 1962, the state courts declared that the salaries of state employees, the amounts of which were specified in the state constitution, could be adjusted for inflation.&lt;ref name=nhok408/&gt; Combs demanded that state employees stick strictly to the rules governing their offices.&lt;ref name=kygovs199&gt;Robinson in ''Kentucky's Governors'', p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, Combs ordered a state audit of [[Carter County, Kentucky|Carter County]] superintendent Heman McGuire, who was known to use his office for political gain.&lt;ref name=pearce131&gt;Pearce, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; While Combs did not have the authority to remove McGuire directly, the audit showed McGuire's misappropriation of funds and abuse of power.&lt;ref name=pearce132&gt;Pearce, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The state school board investigated these findings and removed the county school board members from office; the replacement board members then ousted McGuire.&lt;ref name=pearce132/&gt;

In 1961, a group of citizens from [[Newport, Kentucky|Newport]] asked Combs for help in cracking down on crime in their city. Just across the [[Ohio River]] from [[Cincinnati]], Newport had gained a reputation as a haven for prostitution, gambling, and illegal alcohol. After receiving an [[affidavit]] from the citizens, Combs sent agents from the department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to the city. They cited six bars for violating laws governing liquor sales, and instructed [[Attorney General of Kentucky|Attorney General]] [[John B. Breckinridge]] to prosecute four local officials for failure to enforce the laws. When allegations of civil rights violations in a related trial surfaced, [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Robert Kennedy]] sent federal [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] officials to Newport, prompting the resignation of the sheriff and a circuit judge. Two other local officials were barred from office for four years.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, pp. 165, 167, 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Combs' crackdowns on corruption were politically damaging, including the so-called "truck deal". In 1961, Kyle Vance, a reporter for the Louisville ''[[The Courier-Journal|Courier-Journal]]'' reported that the state was about to purchase some [[dump truck]]s from one of Combs' former campaign officials for $346,800, far more than they were worth, according to the report.&lt;ref name=robinson121&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper, long antagonistic toward Highway Commissioner Clements, painted the deal as a political payoff orchestrated by the highway commissioner.&lt;ref name=robinson121/&gt; In the interest of preserving his reputation as an honest governor, Combs canceled the proposed deal.&lt;ref name=nhok409&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt; This angered Clements, who took Combs' action as a public rebuke.&lt;ref name=nhok409/&gt; The incident caused a rift between him and Combs that never fully healed; Clements later resigned, ostensibly to work on the presidential campaign of his friend and former Senate colleague, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, pp. 138, 150&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he worked against Combs at every opportunity, even joining with Happy Chandler to ensure Wilson Wyatt's defeat in his [[United States Senate elections, 1962|1962 race for the Senate]], in a reversal of his previous promise to support Wyatt.&lt;ref name=nhok409/&gt;

Combs also formed the state's first Human Rights Commission and ordered the [[desegregation]] of all public accommodations in Kentucky.&lt;ref name=nga/&gt; The latter action was commended in a letter to Combs from President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt; In 1961, Combs was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] degree from the University of Kentucky, and on February 17, 1962, he received an award from [[Keep America Beautiful]] for his work on cleaning up Kentucky's highways, including securing passage of a bill requiring that auto junkyards near major roadways be screened from view by fences.&lt;ref name=ukaa/&gt;&lt;ref name=pearce193&gt;Pearce, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Combs' other accomplishments as governor were requiring [[voting machine]]s in state elections and passage of a law making the assessment of state employees for political campaign funds a [[felony]].&lt;ref name=nhok408&gt;Harrison and Klotter, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his term, Combs backed [[Edward T. Breathitt]] to succeed him as governor.&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt; Breathitt defeated Happy Chandler in the Democratic primary, then went on to defeat Republican [[Louie B. Nunn]] in the general election.&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt; It was the only time in the 20th century that a Kentucky governor's preferred successor won election.&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt;

===Later political career===
Following his term as governor, Combs returned to his legal practice. He was a charter member and chairman of the Eastern Kentucky Historical Society and a trustee at [[Campbellsville University|Campbellsville College]].&lt;ref name=powell104/&gt; In 1963, he was awarded the Joseph P. Kennedy International Award for "outstanding contributions and leadership in the field of mental retardations."&lt;ref name=ukaa/&gt; He was named Kentucky's outstanding attorney in 1964, and in the spring of that year, he served as a visiting professor in the Political Science Department at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|University of Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=ukaa/&gt; In 1965, he was inducted into the University of Kentucky's Hall of Distinguished Alumni.&lt;ref name=ukaa/&gt;

In August 1964, Combs declined a nomination to the bench of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=robinson172&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; During the administration of Combs' successor, Ned Breathitt, Republicans gained strength within the state behind the leadership of Louie Nunn, [[Marlow Cook]], and [[William O. Cowger]].&lt;ref name=robinson172/&gt; The Republican rise, coupled with Democratic factionalism, prompted many prominent state Democrats to approach Combs about seeking another term as governor.&lt;ref name=robinson172/&gt; Combs wavered on whether to seek the Democratic nomination until October 1966, when he publicly declared his support for [[Henry Ward (Kentucky politician)|Henry Ward]].&lt;ref name=robinson173&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview with historian George W. Robinson, Combs recounted that he "would have run at that time except for a personal family situation".&lt;ref name=robinson177&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Ward handily defeated his primary opponents, Happy Chandler and Harry Lee Waterfield, but lost in the general election to Louie Nunn.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', pp. 173, 181&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 1967, President Lyndon Johnson nominated Combs to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]], replacing the deceased [[Shackelford Miller Jr.]], and the Senate [[advice and consent|confirmed]] the nomination on April 5, 1967 and Combs received his commission the same day.&lt;ref name=jusc/&gt; Because of the rules of the federal judiciary, Combs had to liquidate his business and banking assets and severely restrict contact with many of his political acquaintances to avoid potential [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] with cases he might adjudicate on the Court of Appeals.&lt;ref name=robinson181&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed frustration that the cases that came before the court were frequently appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], which often gave little weight to the opinions rendered by the Court of Appeals.&lt;ref name=robinson181/&gt; Consequently, he resigned from the court on June 5, 1970, and joined the Louisville law firm of Tarrant, Combs, and Bullitt (later [[Wyatt, Tarrant &amp; Combs]]).&lt;ref name=kygovs199/&gt;

[[File:Wendell-H-Ford.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A man with receding, gray hair and glasses wearing a white shirt with a black tie and jacket|Wendell Ford defeated Combs in the 1971 Democratic gubernatorial primary.]]
With the end of Governor Nunn's term approaching, a rivalry for leadership of the state Democratic party developed between Lieutenant Governor [[Wendell H. Ford]], who had served as Combs' chief administrative assistant during his gubernatorial term, and [[Julian M. Carroll]], speaker of the [[Kentucky House of Representatives|state House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=robinson182&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as Combs resigned from the Court of Appeals, Democratic leaders began asking him to seek the party's gubernatorial nomination in 1971, uniting the party behind him rather than splintering it between Ford and Carroll.&lt;ref name=robinson182/&gt; In June 1970, Carroll announced his intent to run for lieutenant governor, indicating that he would like to serve under Combs as governor.&lt;ref name=robinson182/&gt; While Combs considered whether or not to seek the nomination, Ford declared his candidacy.&lt;ref name=robinson182/&gt; Days later, Combs also entered the race.&lt;ref name=robinson187&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Combs and Ford advocated similar platforms, but Combs encouraged the state's teachers to become more politically active, negotiating higher salaries and better benefits for themselves, while Ford was critical of educators becoming involved in politics and only advocated more spending on education if the state could afford it.&lt;ref name=robinson188&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; In his oral history of Combs, Robinson noted that Ford, thirteen years Combs' junior, "came across better on television" and that many voters in the state felt that Combs must have ulterior motives in leaving a judgeship that paid a salary of $42,500 for the governorship, which paid only $30,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Catholicism in the United States|Catholics]] were also upset that Combs had married his second wife, Helen Clark Rechtin, just forty-three days after his divorce from Mabel Hall was finalized on July 18, 1969.&lt;ref name=robinson188/&gt; (Combs and Hall had been separated for five years prior to finalizing the divorce.)&lt;ref name=kypost/&gt;&lt;ref name=powell104/&gt; Despite these handicaps, many Democrats assumed that Combs, the proven candidate, would easily defeat the newcomer Ford, and fewer than one-third of registered Democrats voted in the primary.&lt;ref name=robinson189&gt;Robinson in ''Bert Combs The Politician'', p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; In what the ''Courier-Journal'' called a "stunning defeat", Ford [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 1971|defeated Combs]] in the Democratic primary and went on to win the governorship.&lt;ref name=robinson189/&gt;

==Later life==
After the 1971 primary, Combs retired from politics and resumed his law practice, maintaining an office in Frankfort. He continued to represent large coal companies, drawing the ire of local environmentalist and author [[Harry M. Caudill]], who asserted that Combs claimed to represent the powerless while actually representing the powerful.&lt;ref name=lhl/&gt; He was active in the formation of the Rural Housing and Development Corporation and served on the [[Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education|Council on Higher Education]].&lt;ref name=kye217/&gt; He also served on President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s General Advisory Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Combs' second marriage ended in divorce on May 19, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky Divorce Index 1973–1993 Search Result&lt;/ref&gt; On December 30, 1988, he married his law assistant, [[Sara Walter Combs|Sara M. Walter]].&lt;ref name=ho6/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky Marriage Index 1973–1993 Search Result&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Rose v. Council for Better Education''===
On October 3, 1984, leaders of the [[Council for Better Education]] asked Combs to represent them in a legal challenge to Kentucky's school financing system, which it claimed unfairly discriminated against poorer school systems in the state.&lt;ref name=dove12&gt;Dove, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Combs felt the lawsuit would be difficult to win and could cause retaliation against his other clients by state government officials.&lt;ref name=dove12/&gt; He needed this lawsuit "about like a hog needs a side saddle", he would later claim; nevertheless, he agreed to take the case if the Council could convince thirty to forty percent of the state's school boards to join it.&lt;ref name=dove12/&gt;&lt;ref name=bosworth116&gt;Bosworth, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The Council eventually persuaded 66 of the 177 school boards to join.&lt;ref name=dove13&gt;Dove, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Working [[pro bono]], Combs assembled a legal team that included [[Kern Alexander]], a Kentucky native and education law expert who was named president of [[Western Kentucky University]] in November 1985.&lt;ref name=dove13/&gt;

[[File:Martha Layne Collins, governor of Kentucky, Nov 8, 1986.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A woman with dark, shoulder-length hair wearing a light scarf and trench coat, speaking into microphones|Gov. Martha Layne Collins' education reforms were not substantial enough to prevent the Council for Better Education from suing the state.]]
Combs first attempted to gain legislative concessions that might preclude the need for a lawsuit.&lt;ref name=dove15&gt;Dove, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Martha Layne Collins]] proposed an education reform agenda and called the legislature into special session in mid-1985 to consider it.&lt;ref name=dove15/&gt; The legislature enacted a corporate [[income tax]] to raise $300&amp;nbsp;million aimed at reducing class sizes, but the Council was seeking more fundamental structural changes to the system and deemed the increased funds insufficient to equalize its members' standing with that of more affluent school districts.&lt;ref name=bosworth118&gt;Bosworth, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dove16&gt;Dove, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfied with the results of the special session, Combs and the Council filed their suit, ''Rose v. Council for Better Education'', on November 20, 1985.&lt;ref name=dove16/&gt; The governor, state superintendent, state treasurer, leaders of both houses of the state legislature, and every member of the state board of education were named as defendants in the case.&lt;ref name=dove16/&gt;

The defendants' request for [[summary judgment]] dismissing the case was not granted, and the trial began in [[Franklin County, Kentucky|Franklin]] circuit court on August 4, 1987. During the trial, a new state superintendent was elected. The new superintendent, John Brock, announced that his office would drop its defense and side with the Council, a major blow to the defense. On May 31, 1988, Judge Ray Corns found in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring that the school finance system was "unconstitutional and discriminatory".&lt;ref name=dove21&gt;Dove, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, the defense announced that it would appeal the ruling to the [[Kentucky Supreme Court]], but recently elected governor [[Wallace G. Wilkinson]] refused to join the appeal and supported Judge Corns' ruling.&lt;ref&gt;Dove, pp. 18, 20–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Opening arguments in the appeal began December 7, 1988.&lt;ref name=dove24&gt;Dove, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The defense argued that the Council lacked standing to bring the suit; Combs rebutted this argument and cited statistics that ranked Kentucky as the most illiterate state in the nation to show how inequitable financing had adversely affected the state's students.&lt;ref name=dove24/&gt; On June 8, 1989, the court handed down a 3–2 ruling declaring Kentucky's entire [[Education in Kentucky|public school system]] unconstitutional and giving the General Assembly until the end of their next legislative session, which would convene in January 1990, to create a replacement.&lt;ref name=dove25&gt;Dove, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bosworth127&gt;Bosworth, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;790 S.W.2d 186 (Kentucky, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the ruling, Combs said "My clients asked for a thimble-full, and [instead] they got a bucket-full".&lt;ref name=dove25/&gt;

The court set out nine minimum standards. In response to the court's ruling, the General Assembly passed the 1990 [[Kentucky Education Reform Act]], which radically altered Kentucky's school system, providing mechanisms to equalize funding among school districts and implementing some of the toughest accountability standards in the United States. Of the legislature's actions, Combs opined "Kentucky has now, by reason of this legislation, decided to become educated—and we have embarked on a crusade for that purpose. Don't be surprised if we should within the next decade develop a first class, world-wide educational system."&lt;ref name=dove31&gt;Dove, pp. 25, 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===
On December 3, 1991, Combs left his law office during a [[flash flood]] about 5:30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;Saxon, "Bert T. Combs, 80, Dies in Flood"&lt;/ref&gt; He was reported missing hours later, and the following day, he was found dead of [[hypothermia]] just downstream from his car in the [[Red River (Kentucky)|Red River]] near [[Rosslyn, Kentucky|Rosslyn]], in [[Powell County, Kentucky|Powell County]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was buried in the Beech Creek Cemetery in Manchester.&lt;ref name=nga/&gt;

In addition to the Bert T. Combs Mountain Parkway, Bert T. Combs Lake, an [[artificial lake]] constructed in 1963 in Clay County, is named in Combs' honor.&lt;ref&gt;"Bert T. Combs Lake". Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 2007, two life-sized statues of Combs were dedicated—one in [[Stanton, Kentucky|Stanton]], near the parkway that bears his name, and another in the county courthouse in Prestonsburg.&lt;ref name=statue&gt;"Governor Bert T. Combs Statue Project". Appalachian Heritage Alliance&lt;/ref&gt; Combs' widow, Sara Walter Combs, became the first woman to serve on the Kentucky Supreme Court in 1993 and currently sits on the Kentucky Court of Appeals, where she was chief judge from 2004 to 2010, also a first for a woman.&lt;ref&gt;"Judge Sara Walter Combs".

'''Blutzeuge''' ({{lang-en|italic=yes|blood witness}}) was a term used in Nazi propaganda in the 1930s–1940s in Germany depicting a hero cult of "fallen" Nazis who had been killed during the Nazi ascent to political power.

One of the few [[left-handed]] golfers on tour, he is a multiple [[Men's major golf championships|major champion]], with victories at the [[Masters Tournament]] in [[2012 Masters Tournament|2012]] and [[2014 Masters Tournament|2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Busbee |first=Jay |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/golf-devil-ball-golf/bubba-watson-wins-masters-dramatic-playoff-233445274.html |title=Bubba Watson wins Masters in dramatic playoff |work=Sports.yahoo.com |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, Watson reached a career-high 2nd place in the [[Official World Golf Ranking]].

Watson is among the longest drivers on the PGA Tour; in 2007 he had an average drive of {{convert|315.2|yd|m}} and can hit a ball over {{convert|350|yd|m}}, capable of generating a ball speed up to {{convert|194|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="PGA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/stats/stat.101.2007.html |title=2007 PGA Tour Driving Distance |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LDC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTSETsi-OFs |title=Long Drive Contest |accessdate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has finished top of the driving distance statistics five times in his career, during the 2006, 2007, 2008, 2012, and 2014 seasons.

==Amateur career==
Watson was born and raised in [[Bagdad, Florida]], near [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]]. He played on the golf team at [[Milton High School (Milton, Florida)|Milton High School]], which had featured future PGA Tour members [[Heath Slocum]] and [[Boo Weekley]] just before he attended.&lt;ref name=redneck&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ajOLZrS0eyac |work=Bloomberg |title=Bubba, Boo, Heath Take on Masters Golf From 'Redneck Riviera' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817052959/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ajOLZrS0eyac |archivedate=August 17, 2013 |date=April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson played golf for [[Faulkner State Community College]] in nearby [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin County]], [[Alabama]], where he was a junior college [[All-America]]n. He transferred to the [[Georgia Bulldogs#Golf|University of Georgia]], the defending [[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships|NCAA champions]], and played for the [[Georgia Bulldogs#Golf|Bulldogs]] in 2000 and 2001. As a junior, Watson helped lead the Bulldogs to the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] title in 2000.

==Professional career==
Watson turned professional in 2001 and joined the [[Nationwide Tour]] where he played until 2005. He finished 21st on the Nationwide Tour's money list in [[2005 Nationwide Tour|2005]], making him the last player to qualify for the following year's [[PGA Tour]]. As a rookie in [[2006 PGA Tour|2006]], he earned $1,019,264 (90th overall) and led the PGA Tour in driving distance at {{convert|319.6|yd|m}}. His longest drive in professional competition was {{convert|442|yd|m}} on the PGA Tour at the [[WGC-Bridgestone Invitational]].

Watson played well at the [[2007 U.S. Open Golf Championship|2007 U.S. Open]]. He was in the final group on Saturday after shooting rounds of 70-71 (+1) at [[Oakmont Country Club]] near [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. Watson was one stroke off the lead after 36 holes but then slipped, shooting 74 (+4) in both the third and fourth rounds; he finished in a tie for fifth.

===2010===
Watson claimed his first [[PGA Tour]] win on June 27, 2010, in [[Cromwell, Connecticut]], at the [[Travelers Championship]] on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff with [[Corey Pavin]] and [[Scott Verplank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/golf/8766691.stm |title=Justin Rose falters as Bubba Watson wins Travelers |date=June 27, 2010 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=June 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson tearfully dedicated the win to his parents, specifically his father who was battling [[cancer]].

Watson was runner-up to [[Martin Kaymer]] at the [[2010 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]] at [[Whistling Straits]], falling in the three-hole aggregate playoff that initially included [[Dustin Johnson]], before he incurred a two-stroke penalty on the 72nd hole. Watson led the playoff after a birdie on the first hole, but Kaymer birdied the par-3 second hole to tie, effectively turning the playoff into sudden-death. Watson's second shot found the water hazard and Kaymer bested him by a stroke to win the major championship.

Watson had his own clothing line called "Bubba Golf" at the former [[Steve &amp; Barry's]]. He was invited on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' after he sent her a video of a golf trick shot he completed for her birthday.

===2011===
On January 30, [[2011 PGA Tour|2011]], Watson won his second PGA Tour event, the [[Farmers Insurance Open]], finishing one stroke ahead of runner-up [[Phil Mickelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=6074975 |title=Bubba Watson holds off Phil Mickelson |date=January 30, 2011 |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=February 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson picked up his second win of the 2011 season and third career PGA Tour title on May 1 when he defeated [[Webb Simpson]] at the second playoff hole at the [[Zurich Classic of New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12176_6909168,00.html |title=Watson claims his third PGA Tour title in New Orleans |date=May 2, 2011 |work=Sky Sports |accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both players birdied the first playoff hole, with Watson holing a 12-footer; he birdied the next hole to win the tournament.

In July 2011, Watson provoked controversy by criticizing the [[Alstom Open de France]] on the [[European Tour]], in which he was playing under a sponsor's exemption. He indicated after his first round that he would not be playing any further events on the European Tour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-2010197/Homesick-Bubba-Watson-set-turn-European-Tour.html |title=Homesick Bubba Watson set to turn his back on European Tour |work=Daily Mail |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and complained after his second round about security and organization at the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/13991075.stm |title=Bubba Watson criticises French Open crowd control |publisher=BBC News |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson took part in the Long Drive Contest for charity at the [[Hyundai Tournament of Champions]] alongside [[Dustin Johnson]] and [[Robert Garrigus]]. He finished in second place, with a longest drive of {{convert|370|yd|m|0}} behind a drive of over {{convert|400|yd|m|0}} by [[Jamie Sadlowski]].

===2012===
[[File:BubbaWatson02.jpg|thumb|Watson at Schüco Open, 2012]]
Watson began the year with three top-5 finishes in seven events, including finishing second at the [[WGC-Cadillac Championship]].&lt;ref name=season&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.25804.bubba-watson.html/season/#uber |title=Bubba Watson – PGA Tour – 2012 Results |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Masters win====
Watson's first [[Men's major golf championships|major championship]] win came at the [[2012 Masters Tournament|Masters]]. He began the final round at six-under-par, three strokes off the lead, held by [[Peter Hanson]]. On the back nine, Watson bogeyed the par-3 12th hole to return to even par for the round. He then recorded four consecutive birdies for a round of 68 (-4) and tied for the 72-hole lead with fourth-round playing partner [[Louis Oosthuizen]] at ten-under-par. In the [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden-death]] playoff, Oosthuizen and Watson both made par on the uphill 18th hole. On the next hole, the downhill 10th, both drove their tee shots towards the woods to the right of the hole. Oosthuizen's landed in the rough {{convert|220|yd|m}} away, while Watson's ball landed deep in the woods on pine straw, {{convert|164|yd|m}} from the pin without a clear shot to the green. Watson executed a miraculous recovery shot with 40 yards of hook on his 52-degree gap wedge and stopped the ball within fifteen feet of the hole. Oosthuizen's approach shot landed short of the green, but he chipped past the hole and narrowly missed his lengthy putt for par. Watson trickled his birdie putt a foot past the hole, took his time on the very short par putt, then made it for the emotional victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Rest of 2012====
Following his Masters win, Watson began to struggle. He missed the cut at the [[Memorial Tournament]] and the [[2012 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]. A week after the U.S. Open, he finished tied for second at the [[Travelers Championship]]. A month later, he played [[2012 Open Championship|Open Championship]], the third major of the year. While shooting a first round of −3 to tie him at third place, he never advanced much after that, finishing tied for 23rd place. In the final major of the year, the [[2012 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]], Watson tied for 11th. He finished the year with one win, six top-5 finishes, seven top-10 finishes and three missed cuts.&lt;ref name=season/&gt;

===2013===
Watson began the season playing the [[Hyundai Tournament of Champions]], where he finished tied for fourth place, and reached the quarterfinals in the [[WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship]]. In the subsequent World Golf Championship event, the [[WGC-Cadillac Championship]], he began very strong with rounds of 66 and 69, but finished with rounds of 71 and 75 and tied for 18th place.

After finishing tied 14th place in the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]], he returned to the [[2013 Masters Tournament|Masters]] as the defending champion. Never in contention in the tournament, he finished 50th after a final round of 77. Watson tied for 37th at [[2013 Players Championship|The Players Championship]]. On the second major of the year, the [[2013 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], he finished with a solid 71 in the first round, just four shots off the lead, but a second round score of 76 left him out of contention, and he tied for 32nd. At the [[Travelers Championship]] he took the lead after a second round of 67, but in the final round, leading by one with three to play, he triple-bogeyed the par-3 16th and finished two shots back in 4th place.

Tying for 30th at the [[Greenbrier Classic]], he then played in the third major of the year, [[2013 Open Championship|The Open Championship]]. After two solid rounds of 70 and 73, he shot 77 in the third round, and tied for 32nd.

===2014===
At the [[Waste Management Phoenix Open]], Watson held the lead for most of the tournament, but he finished runner-up to [[Kevin Stadler]].
 
Watson earned his fifth career PGA Tour victory—and his first since the 2012 Masters—at the [[2014 PGA Tour|2014]] [[Northern Trust Open]] at [[Riviera Country Club]]. He shot back-to-back 64s over the weekend to defeat runner-up [[Dustin Johnson]] by two strokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-0217-northern-trust-golf-20140217,0,5763704.story#axzz2tXvoGNzK |title=Bubba Watson is just too good to be denied at Riviera |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=James |first=Mike |date=February 16, 2014 |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victory raised him to 14 in the Official World Golf Ranking. He followed that win with two more strong finishes—a ninth-place tie in the [[2014 WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship|WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship]] and a second-place tie in the [[2014 WGC-Cadillac Championship|WGC-Cadillac Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.25804.bubba-watson.html/season |title=PGA Tour Season Results |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those performances elevated him from 14 to 12 in the world ranking.&lt;ref name=owgr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owgr.com/Ranking/PlayerProfile.aspx?playerId=7334 |title=Bubba Watson |publisher=OWGR |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second Masters win====
Watson won the [[2014 Masters Tournament|Masters]] by three shots, with a score of 280 (−8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/golf/mastersaugusta/10764478/Masters-2014-Bubba-Watson-claims-second-green-jacket.html |title=Bubba Watson claims second green jacket |date=April 14, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first= James |last=Corrigan |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the final round tied for the lead with 20-year-old Masters rookie [[Jordan Spieth]]. Playing together in the final pairing, Spieth birdied the seventh hole for a two-stroke lead over Watson. However, the momentum turned on the par-5 eighth hole. Spieth had a birdie putt, but ended up three-putting for bogey while Watson birdied to pull into a first-place tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/masters/2014/04/13/bubba-watson-jordan-spieth-masters-green-jacket/7678473/ |title=Bubba Watson wins second green jacket at Masters |date=April 14, 2014 |newspaper=USA Today |first=Steve |last=DiMeglio |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, on the ninth hole, Watson birdied again while Spieth bogeyed, and the four-shot swing over two holes gave Watson a lead that he never relinquished in a win over Spieth and [[Jonas Blixt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbssports.com/golf/eye-on-golf/24525401/bubba-watson-wins-2014-masters |title=Bubba Watson wins 2014 Masters |work=CBS Sports |first=Kyle |last=Porter |date=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the win, Watson became the 17th player to win the Masters two or more times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters14/story/_/id/10778027/bubba-watson-wins-second-masters-title-three-years |title=

===2015=== 
Watson won the [[Travelers Championship]] to move him to third in the [[Official World Golf Ranking]].  He garnered his second victory in 2015 by winning the unofficial [[Hero World Challenge]] in the Bahamas, besting fellow American [[Patrick Reed]] by three strokes.

===2016===
Prior to the [[Waste Management Phoenix Open]] in early February, Watson caused a bit of controversy after publicly admitting his dislike for the course, [[TPC Scottsdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/bubba-watson-not-a-fan-of-this-course |title=Bubba Watson jeered after course remarks |date=February 4, 2016 |magazine=bunkered |first=Martin |last=Inglis}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he was jeered by fans for the majority of the tournament, later criticizing the media for "turning his words around".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/bubba-watson-really-hurt-by-media-treatment |title=Bubba Watson 'really hurt' by media treatment |date=February 8, 2016 |magazine=bunkered |first=Martin |last=Inglis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later though, he returned to the winner's circle after winning the Northern Trust Open at Riviera for a second time in three years, seeing off the challenge of Adam Scott and Jason Kokrak to win by one shot on 15-under-par.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/bubba-watson-still-pretty-mad-over-phoenix-despite-win |title=Bubba Watson still 'mad' despite win |date=February 22, 2016 |magazine=bunkered |first=Martin |last=Inglis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===
Watson did not chalk a win during the [[2017 PGA Tour|2017]] season, and missed the cut at three of the year's four majors (his only cut a T27 at [[2017 Open Championship|The Open Championship]]). He had five top-10 finishes with more than $1.3 million in tour earnings.&lt;ref name=pga&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pgatour.com/players/player.25804.bubba-watson.html |title=Bubba Watson |access-date=February 18, 2018 |publisher=PGA Tour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018===
The [[2018 PGA Tour|2018]] season started with a T7 at the [[QBE Shootout]] in December 2017 marking the best of his first six starts. Watson returned to the winner's circle with a 12-under finish at the [[Genesis Open]] in February, his third victory at this tournament (2014, 2016), all at Riviera. His trifecta at the Genesis (previously known as the [[Los Angeles Open]], Northern Trust Open, and Nissan Open) makes him only the fifth to win this long-standing event at least three times, along with [[Ben Hogan]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Lloyd Mangrum]], and [[Macdonald Smith]]. On March 25, he gained his eleventh tour win at the [[2018 WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play|WGC-Dell Match Play]] event in [[Austin Country Club|Austin, Texas]], with a winner's share of $1.7 million.&lt;ref name=pga/&gt; On June 24, 2018, he won again at the [[Travelers Championship]] winning $1.26 million at TPC River Highlands. This was his third career victory at the Travelers tournament (2010, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/23897954/bubba-watson-wins-third-travelers-championship |title=Bubba Watson closes with 63 to win third Travelers Championship |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Watson qualified for the U.S. team participating in the [[2018 Ryder Cup]]. Europe defeated the U.S. team 17 1/2 to 10 1/2. Watson went 1–2–0.

Watson was nicknamed by his father after the former professional American football player [[Bubba Smith]].&lt;ref name=redneck/&gt; Watson is married to Angela "Angie" Watson (née Ball), a {{height|ft=6|in=3}} [[Canada|Canadian]] whom he met at [[University of Georgia|Georgia]] while he was on the golf team and she was on the [[Georgia Lady Bulldogs basketball|women's basketball]] team.&lt;ref name=augusta/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Georgina |last=Littlejohn |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1316589/RYDER-CUP-2010-Tiger-Woods-caught-ogling-Katherine-Jenkins.html |title=Watch out Katherine, there's a Tiger on your tail: Woods caught ogling Welsh beauty at the Ryder Cup opening ceremony |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married in September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/angie-watson-10-things-know-about-masters-champ-bubba-watsons-wife-435100 |title=Angie Watson: 10 Things To Know About Masters Champ Bubba Watson's Wife |work=International Business Times |first=Jason |last=Van Hoven |date=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, she was diagnosed with an enlarged [[pituitary gland]], which accounts for her height.&lt;ref name="pituitary"&gt;{{cite web |work=Boston.com |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/golf/articles/2010/06/28/long_watson_waited_a_long_time |title=Long Watson waited a long time |date=June 28, 2010 |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to have a child naturally, various family issues, including the illness and death of Watson's father in 2010, kept them from attempting to adopt until 2011–12.&lt;ref name=Wetzel/&gt; In March 2012, one week after a potential adoption fell through at the last moment,&lt;ref name=Wetzel/&gt; Watson and his wife adopted a one-month-old baby boy named Caleb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.golfchannel.com/news/golftalkcentral/bubba-watson-wife-adopt-baby-boy |title=Watson, wife adopt baby boy |work=Golf Channel |date=March 28, 2012 |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2014 the Watsons adopted a baby girl.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2559">'''Caspar Phair''' (died 1933) was one of the early settlers of [[Lillooet, British Columbia]], Canada, arriving about 1877 to take up the role of the village's school teacher.. He  emigrated from [[Ireland]].   Caspar Phair became Lillooet's Government Agent, a position which at one time encompassed a wide-ranging assemblage of duties. In time he assumed the roles of magistrate, chief constable, [[coroner]], fire chief, and game warden.  His lasting mark was made in business as a merchant-launching the family's general store on a 'run' that would extend over 50 years.

In 1879 he married Cerise Eyre, daughter of Maria Josephine Martley by a previous marriage. Cerise Armit Eyre and her sister Mary Eyre had remained in England with their grandparent's  when the Martley's travelled to the new colony of British Columbia in 1861. Maria's daughter's by Eyre joined the family in 1871. The wedding took place on The Grange,the Martley ranching property near Pavilion. Cerise's sister Mary would marry Henry Cornwall of Ashcroft Ranch.

In the 1890s the Phairs had a residence that they named [[Longford House]], built in Lillooet.  This elegant building is said to be partially modeled on and named after Mrs Phair's home in [[Eyrecourt]], of [[County Galway]] in Ireland. Longford survives to this day as the village's only significant example of heritage-quality domestic architecture.

Caspar Phair's son, [[A.W.A. (Artie) Phair]], was a [[coroner]] as well as a noted chronicler and photographer of Lillooet's history.

Caspar and Cerise Phair died in 1933, leaving their house to Harold Phair, Artie's son.  Longford House was later bought by Dr. [[Masajiro Miyazaki]] and is now called the [[Miyazaki House]].

'''CoSMoS''' was a UK funded research project seeking to build capacity in generic modelling tools and simulation techniques for complex systems. Its acronym stands for Complex Systems Modelling and Simulation.
This was a four-year project, running from 2007 to 2011 as a collaboration between the [[University of York]] and [[University of Kent|Kent]], with further collaborations from the [[University of Abertay Dundee]] and [[Bristol Robotics Laboratory]].

== History ==
Collaboration between the universities of York and Kent started with the [http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/nature/tuna TUNA project], a feasibility study looking at the requirements for developing networks of [[nanite]]s that behave safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = TUNA - Theory Underpinning Nanotech Assemblers| url = http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/nature/tuna/| accessdate = 20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project involved researchers from York, Kent and Surrey. TUNA's outcomes were both conceptual and practical. An example of theoretical contribution consists of investigators showing that [[Emergence|emergent properties]] do not [[Refinement (computing)|refine]]
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference  | first = Fiona  | last = Polack  | authorlink =   | author2 = Stepney, S.  | title = Emergent properties do not refine  | booktitle = REFINE 2005 workshop  | pages = 163–181  | date = July 2005  | publisher = Elsevier  | location = Guildford  | volume = 137  | number = 2  | series = ENTSC  | url = http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~fiona/PUBS/REFINE05.pdf  | accessdate = 20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but gave insights into the engineering of emergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference  | first = Susan  | last = Stepney  | authorlink =   | author2 = Polack, F.| author3 =  Turner, H.  | title = Engineering emergence  | booktitle = Proceedings of the 11th IEEE International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems  | pages = 89–97  | year = 2006  | publisher = IEEE Computer Society  | url = http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/nature/tuna/outputs/Stepney-iceccs06.pdf  | accessdate = 20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Practical results were obtained through the use of a blood clotting case-study. This led to the development of a [[Process-oriented programming|process-oriented]], large-scale simulation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 3D Blood Clotting| url = https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/research/groups/plas/wiki/3D_Blood_Clotting| accessdate = 20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; implemented in [[occam-pi]].

# to search for logic circuits having certain constraints on hardware design
# to evaluate these logics in terms of their discriminating ability over samples of the character set they are expected to recognize.

More recently, traditional CAD simulation is seen to be transformed to CAutoD by biologically-inspired [[machine learning]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/63535/ Zhan, Z.H., et al. (2011). Evolutionary computation meets machine learning: a survey, IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 6(4), 68-75.]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[search algorithm|search techniques]] such as [[evolutionary computation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/768h/0768%20(Hornby).pdf Gregory S.

Clune and H. Lipson (2011). Evolving three-dimensional objects with a generative encoding inspired by developmental biology.

==Guiding designs by performance improvements==
[[File:Computer-automated design.png|thumb|right|350px|Interaction in computer-automated design]]
To meet the ever-growing demand of quality and competitiveness, iterative physical prototyping is now often replaced by '[[digital prototyping]]' of a 'good design', which aims to meet multiple objectives such as maximised output, energy efficiency, highest speed and cost-effectiveness. The design problem concerns both finding the best design within a known range (i.e., through 'learning' or 'optimisation') and finding a new and better design beyond the existing ones (i.e., through creation and invention). This is equivalent to a [[search problem]] in an almost certainly, multidimensional (multivariate), multi-modal space with a single (or weighted) objective or multiple objectives.

==Normalized objective function: cost vs. fitness==
Using single-objective CAutoD as an example, if the objective function, either as a [[Loss function|cost function]] &lt;math&gt;J\in[0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;, or inversely, as a [[fitness function]] &lt;math&gt;f\in(0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;f = \tfrac{J}{1+J}&lt;/math&gt;,

is differentiable under practical constraints in the multidimensional space, the design problem may be solved analytically. Finding the parameter sets that result in a zero first-order derivative and that satisfy the second-order derivative conditions would reveal all local optima. Then comparing the values of the performance index of all the local optima, together with those of all boundary parameter sets, would lead to the global optimum, whose corresponding 'parameter' set will thus represent the best design.  However, in practice, the optimization usually involves multiple objectives and the matters involving derivatives are lot more complex.

==Dealing with practical objectives==
In practice, the objective value may be noisy or even non-numerical, and hence its gradient information may be unreliable or unavailable. This is particularly true when the problem is multi-objective.  At present, many designs and refinements are mainly made through a manual trial-and-error process with the help of a CAD [[simulation]] package. Usually, such ''[[a posteriori]]'' learning or adjustments need to be repeated many times until a ‘satisfactory’ or ‘optimal’ design emerges.

==Exhaustive search==
In theory, this adjustment process can be automated by computerised search, such as [[exhaustive search]].  As this is an [[exponential algorithm]], it may not deliver solutions in practice within a limited period of time.

==Search in polynomial time==
One approach to [[virtual engineering]] and automated design is [[evolutionary computation]] such as [[evolutionary algorithm]]s.

===Evolutionary algorithms===
To reduce the search time, the biologically-inspired evolutionary algorithm (EA) can be used instead, which is a (non-deterministic) [[Exponential algorithm#Polynomial time|polynomial algorithm]].  The EA based multi-objective "search team" can be interfaced with an existing CAD simulation package in a batch mode. The EA encodes the design parameters (encoding being necessary if some parameters are non-numerical) to refine multiple candidates through parallel and interactive search. In the search process, '[[natural selection|selection]]' is performed using '[[survival of the fittest]]' ''a posteriori'' learning. To obtain the next 'generation' of possible solutions, some parameter values are exchanged between two candidates (by an operation called '[[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]]') and new values introduced (by an operation called '[[mutation]]'). This way, the evolutionary technique makes use of past trial information in a similarly intelligent manner to the human designer.

The EA based optimal designs can start from the designer's existing design database or from an initial generation of candidate designs obtained randomly. A number of finally evolved top-performing candidates will represent several automatically optimized digital prototypes.

There are websites that demonstrate interactive evolutionary algorithms for design. [http://EndlessForms.com EndlessForms.com] allows you to evolve 3D objects online and have them 3D printed.  [http://www.picbreeder.org PicBreeder.org] allows you to do the same for 2D images.

==Translation halt==
There are a lot of [[mRNA]]s that have been [[DNA transcription|transcribed]] but not [[mrna translation|translated]] during dictyate.&lt;ref name=maskin&gt;[http://www.molecule.org/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS1097276500802300 Molecule.org - Maskin Is a CPEB-Associated Factor that Transiently Interacts with eIF-4E] Barbara Stebbins-Boaz,1 Quiping Cao,1 Cornelia H de Moor,1 Raul Mendez,1 and Joel D Richter1&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before ovulation, the oocyte of interest activates these mRNA strains.

===Biochemistry mechanism=== &lt;!--maskin redirects here--&gt;
Translation of mRNA in dictyate is partly explained by molecules binding to sites on the mRNA strain, which results in that [[initiation factor]]s of translation can not bind to that site. Two such molecules, that impedes initiation factors, are [[CPEB]] and ''maskin'', which bind to [[cytoplasmic polyadenylation element|CPE]] (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element). When these two molecules remain together, then maskin binds the initiation factor [[eIF-4E]],&lt;ref name=maskin/&gt; and thus eIF4E can no longer interact with the other initiation factors&lt;ref&gt;Lodish 2008, p.351&lt;/ref&gt; and  no translation occurs. On the other hand, dissolution of the CPEB/maskin complex leads to eIF-4E binding to the initiation factor [[eIF-4G]],&lt;ref name=maskin/&gt; and thus translation starts, which contributes to the end of dictyate and further maturation of the oocyte.

'''Diego Álvarez''' ( {{lang-lat|Didacus Alvarez}}; c. 1555 – 1632) was a Spanish theologian who opposed the [[Molinism]]. He was [[archbishop]] of [[Trani]] from 1607 to his death.

==Life==
Diego Álvarez was born at [[Medina de Rioseco]], [[Old Castile]], about 1555.{{r|CH}} He entered the [[Dominican Order]] in his native city, and taught theology for twenty years in the Spanish cities of [[Burgos]], Trianos, [[Plasencia]], and [[Valladolid]], and for ten years (1596-1606) at the Dominican convent of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]], in Rome. From 1603 to 1606 he was elected Regent of the ''[[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Collegium Divi Thomae]]'' of the Dominicans in Rome.{{r|Treccani}}

Shortly after his arrival in Rome (7 November, 1596) he presented to [[Pope Clement VIII]] a memorial requesting him to examine the work ''Concordia liberi Arbitrii'', by [[Luis de Molina]], [[Jesuit|S.J.]], which, upon it publication in 1588, had given rise to bitter controversy, known as [[Molinism]], on the extent of knowledge of God in the [[Divine providence]]. Before the Congregation ([[Congregatio de Auxiliis]]), appointed by the Pope to settle the dispute, he defended the [[Thomistic]] doctrines of grace, predestination, etc., alone for three years, and, thereafter, conjointly with his confrere [[Tomas de Lemos]], to whom he gave the first place, until the suspension of the Congregation (1606).

He was appointed, 19 March, 1606, by [[Pope Paul V]], to the [[Archbishop of Trani|Archbishopric of Trani]],{{r|CH}} The [[episcopal consecration]] followed on 1 April in the Basilica of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] by the hands of [[Girolamo Bernerio]]. He passed the remainder of his life in [[Trani]] where he died on 10 May 1632.{{r|Terra}} He was buried in that [[Trani Cathedral|cathedral]].{{r|Galleria}}

'''Electrocorticography''' ('''ECoG'''), or '''intracranial electroencephalography''' ('''iEEG'''),  is a type of [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] monitoring that uses [[electrode]]s placed directly on the exposed surface of the [[brain]] to record electrical activity from the [[cerebral cortex]]. In contrast, conventional [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) electrodes monitor this activity from outside the skull. ECoG may be performed either in the operating room during surgery (intraoperative ECoG) or outside of surgery (extraoperative ECoG).  Because a [[craniotomy]] (a surgical incision into the skull) is required to implant the electrode grid, ECoG is an invasive procedure.

== History ==

ECoG was pioneered in the early 1950s by [[Wilder Penfield]] and [[Herbert Jasper]], neurosurgeons at the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]].&lt;ref name="Palmini 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |first= A |last= Palmini| year = 2006 | title = The concept of the epileptogenic zone: A modern look at Penfield and Jasper’s views on the role of interictal spikes | journal = [[Epileptic Disorders (journal)|Epileptic Disorders]] | volume = 8 |issue= Suppl 2 | pages = S10–5|url= http://www.epilepticdisorders.com/e-docs/00/04/21/CD/document_article.phtml |pmid= 17012068 |doi= |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two developed ECoG as part of their groundbreaking [[Montreal procedure]], a surgical protocol used to treat patients with severe [[epilepsy]].  The cortical potentials recorded by ECoG were used to identify epileptogenic zones – regions of the cortex that generate epileptic [[seizure]]s.  These zones would then be surgically removed from the cortex during resectioning, thus destroying the brain tissue where epileptic seizures had originated.  Penfield and Jasper also used electrical stimulation during ECoG recordings in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery under [[local anesthesia]].&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= A |last1= Kuruvilla |first2= R |last2= Flink | year = 2003 | title =Intraoperative electrocorticography in epilepsy surgery: Useful or not? | journal = [[Seizure (journal)|Seizure]] | volume =12 | pages = 577–84 | url= http://www.seizure-journal.com/article/S1059-1311%2803%2900095-5/fulltext | doi = 10.1016/S1059-1311(03)00095-5 | pmid = 14630497 | issue = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure was used to explore the functional anatomy of the brain, mapping speech areas and identifying the somatosensory and somatomotor cortex areas to be excluded from surgical removal.
A doctor named [[Robert Galbraith Heath]] was also an early researcher of the brain at the Tulane University School of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=11232368 | doi=10.1076/jhin.9.3.262.1787 | volume=9 | title=The Tulane Electrical Brain Stimulation Program a historical case study in medical ethics | year=2000 | author=Baumeister AA | journal=J Hist Neurosci | pages=262–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/726594_3 "Deep Brain Stimulation between 1947 and 1987: The Untold Story" Authors Marwan Hariz, Patric Blomstedt, Ludvic Zrinzo. 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electrophysiological basis ==

ECoG signals are composed of synchronized postsynaptic potentials ([[local field potentials]]), recorded directly from the exposed surface of the cortex.  The potentials occur primarily in cortical [[pyramidal cells]], and thus must be conducted through several layers of the cerebral cortex, [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF), [[pia mater]], and [[arachnoid mater]] before reaching subdural recording electrodes placed just below the [[dura mater]] (outer cranial membrane).   However, to reach the scalp electrodes of a conventional [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG), electrical signals must also be conducted through the [[Human skull|skull]], where potentials rapidly attenuate due to the low conductivity of [[bone]].  For this reason, the spatial resolution of ECoG is much higher than EEG, a critical imaging advantage for presurgical planning.&lt;ref name="Hasiguchi 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= K |last1= Hashiguchi |first2= T |last2= Morioka |first3= F |last3= Yoshida |first4= Y |last4= Miyagi |first5= S |last5= Nagata |first6= A |last6= Sakata |first7= T |last7= Sasaki |displayauthors= 4 | year = 2007 | title = Correlation between scalp-recorded electroencephalographic and electrocorticographic activities during ictal period | journal = [[Seizure (journal)|Seizure]] | volume = 16 | pages = 238–247|url= http://www.seizure-journal.com/article/S1059-1311%2806%2900248-2/fulltext | doi = 10.1016/j.seizure.2006.12.010 | pmid = 17236792 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ECoG offers a temporal resolution of approximately 5 ms and a spatial resolution of 1&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="Asano 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= E |last1= Asano |first2= C |last2= Juhasz |first3= A |last3= Shah |first4= O |last4= Muzik |first5= DC |last5= Chugani |first6= J |last6= Shad |first7= S |last7= Sood |first8= HT |last8= Chugani |displayauthors= 4 | year = 2005 | title = Origin and propagation of epileptic spasms delineated on electrocorticography | journal = [[Epilepsia (journal)|Epilepsia]] | volume =46 | pages = 1086–1097| url = | doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2005.05205.x | pmid = 16026561 | issue = 7 | pmc = 1360692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using depth electrodes, the [[local field potential]] gives a measure of a neural population in a sphere with a radius of 0.5–3&amp;nbsp;mm around the tip of the electrode.&lt;ref name="Logothetis 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= NK |last1= Logothetis | year = 2003 | title = The underpinning of the BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging signal |journal= [[The Journal of Neuroscience]] | volume = 23 | pages = 3963–71|url= http://www.jneurosci.org/content/23/10/3963.long | pmid = 12764080 | issue = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a sufficiently high sampling rate (more than about 10&amp;nbsp;kHz), depth electrodes can also measure [[action potentials]].&lt;ref name="Ulbert 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= I |last1= Ulbert |first2= E |last2= Halgren |first3= G |last3= Heit |first4= G |last4= Karmos | year = 2001 | title = Multiple microelectrode-recording system for human intracortical applications | journal = [[Journal of Neuroscience Methods]] | volume =106 | pages = 69–79| url = | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0270(01)00330-2 | pmid = 11248342 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In which case the spatial resolution is down to individual neurons, and the field of view of an individual electrode is approximately 0.05-0.35&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="Logothetis 2003"/&gt;

== Procedure ==

The ECoG recording is performed from electrodes placed on the exposed cortex.  In order to access the cortex, a surgeon must first perform a craniotomy, removing a part of the skull to expose the brain surface.  This procedure may be performed either under [[general anesthesia]] or under local anesthesia if patient interaction is required for functional cortical mapping.  Electrodes are then surgically implanted on the surface of the cortex, with placement guided by the results of preoperative EEG and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).  Electrodes may either be placed outside the dura mater (epidural) or under the dura mater (subdural).  ECoG electrode arrays typically consist of sixteen sterile, disposable stainless steel, carbon tip, platinum, [[Platinum-iridium alloy]] or gold ball electrodes, each mounted on a ball and socket joint for ease in positioning.  These electrodes are attached to an overlying frame in a “crown” or “halo” configuration.&lt;ref name="Schuh 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= L |last1= Schuh |first2= I |last2= Drury | year = 1996 | title = Intraoperative electrocorticography and direct cortical electrical stimulation | journal = [[Seminars in Anesthesia]] | volume =16 | pages = 46–55| url = | doi=10.1016/s0277-0326(97)80007-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subdural strip and grid electrodes are also widely used in various dimensions, having anywhere from 4 to 256&lt;ref name="MesgaraniChang2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Mesgarani |first1= N |last2= Chang |first2= EF |title= Selective cortical representation of attended speaker in multi-talker speech perception |journal= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume= 485 |issue= 7397 |year= 2012 |pages= 233–6 |pmid= 22522927 |pmc= 3870007 |doi= 10.1038/nature11020}}&lt;/ref&gt; electrode contacts.  The grids are transparent, flexible, and numbered at each electrode contact.  Standard spacing between grid electrodes is 1&amp;nbsp;cm; individual electrodes are typically 5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.  The electrodes sit lightly on the cortical surface, and are designed with enough flexibility to ensure that normal movements of the brain do not cause injury.  A key advantage of strip and grid electrode arrays is that they may be slid underneath the dura mater into cortical regions not exposed by the craniotomy.  Strip electrodes and crown arrays may be used in any combination desired.  Depth electrodes may also be used to record activity from deeper structures such as the [[hippocampus]].

== DCES ==

Direct cortical electrical stimulation (DCES), also known as [[cortical stimulation mapping]], is frequently performed in concurrence with ECoG recording for functional mapping of the cortex and identification of critical cortical structures.&lt;ref name="Schuh 1996"/&gt; When using a crown configuration, a handheld wand bipolar stimulator may be used at any location along the electrode array.   However, when using a subdural strip, stimulation must be applied between pairs of adjacent electrodes due to the nonconductive material connecting the electrodes on the grid.  Electrical stimulating currents applied to the cortex are relatively low, between 2 and 4 mA for somatosensory stimulation, and near 15 mA for cognitive stimulation.&lt;ref name="Schuh 1996"/&gt;
  
The functions most commonly mapped through DCES are primary motor, primary sensory, and language.  The patient must be alert and interactive for mapping procedures, though patient involvement varies with each mapping procedure.  Language mapping may involve naming, reading aloud, repetition, and oral comprehension; somatosensory mapping requires that the patient describe sensations experienced across the face and extremities as the surgeon stimulates different cortical regions.&lt;ref name="Schuh 1996"/&gt;

== Clinical applications ==

Since its development in the 1950s, ECoG has been used to localize epileptogenic zones during presurgical planning, map out cortical functions, and to predict the success of epileptic surgical resectioning.  ECoG offers several advantages over alternative diagnostic modalities:

* Flexible placement of recording and stimulating electrodes&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2003"/&gt;
* Can be performed at any stage before, during, and after a surgery
* Allows for direct electrical stimulation of the brain, identifying critical regions of the cortex to be avoided during surgery
* Greater precision and sensitivity than an EEG scalp recording - spatial resolution is higher and signal-to-noise ratio is superior due to closer proximity to neural activity

Limitations of ECoG include:

* Limited sampling time – seizures ([[ictal]] events) may not be recorded during the ECoG recording period
* Limited field of view – electrode placement is limited by the area of exposed cortex and surgery time, sampling errors may occur
* Recording is subject to the influence of anesthetics, narcotic analgesics, and the surgery itself&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2003"/&gt;

=== Intractable epilepsy ===

Epilepsy is currently ranked as the third most commonly diagnosed neurological disorder, afflicting approximately 2.5 million people in the United States alone.&lt;ref name="Kohrman 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= M |last1= Kohrman | year = 2007 | title = What is epilepsy?  Clinical perspectives in the diagnosis and treatment | journal = [[Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology]]  | volume = 24 | pages = 87–95| url = | doi = 10.1097/WNP.0b013e3180415b51 | pmid = 17414964 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epileptic seizures are chronic and unrelated to any immediately treatable causes, such as toxins or infectious diseases, and may vary widely based on etiology, clinical symptoms, and site of origin within the brain.  For patients with intractable epilepsy – epilepsy that is unresponsive to [[Anticonvulsant|anticonvulsants]] – surgical treatment may be a viable treatment option.

;Extraoperative ECoG

Before a patient can be identified as a candidate for resectioning surgery, MRI must be performed to demonstrate the presence of a structural lesion within the cortex, supported by EEG evidence of epileptogenic tissue.&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2003"/&gt; Once a lesion has been identified, ECoG may be performed to determine the location and extent of the lesion and surrounding irritative region.  The scalp EEG, while a valuable diagnostic tool, lacks the precision necessary to localize the epileptogenic region.  ECoG is considered to be the gold standard for assessing neuronal activity in patients with epilepsy, and is widely used for presurgical planning to guide surgical resection of the lesion and epileptogenic zone.&lt;ref name="Sugano 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= H |last1= Sugano |first2= H |last2= Shimizu |first3= S |last3= Sunaga | year = 2007 | title = Efficacy of intraoperative electrocorticography for assessing seizure outcomes in intractable epilepsy patients with temporal-lobe-mass lesions | journal = [[Seizure (journal)|Seizure]] | volume = 16 | pages = 120–127 |url= http://www.seizure-journal.com/article/S1059-1311%2806%2900208-1/fulltext | doi = 10.1016/j.seizure.2006.10.010 | pmid = 17158074 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= KJ |last1= Miller |first2= M |last2= denNijs |first3= P |last3= Shenoy |first4= JW |last4= Miller |first5= RPN |last5= Rao |first6= JG |last6= Ojemann |displayauthors= 4 | year = 2007 | title = Real-time functional brain mapping using electrocorticography | journal = [[NeuroImage]] | volume = 37| pages = 504–507| url = | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.05.029 | pmid = 17604183 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the surgery depends on accurate localization and removal of the epileptogenic zone.  ECoG data is assessed with regard to ictal spike activity – “diffuse fast wave activity” recorded during a seizure – and [[inter-ictal|interictal]] epileptiform activity (IEA), brief bursts of neuronal activity recorded between epileptic events.  ECoG is also performed following the resectioning surgery to detect any remaining epileptiform activity, and to determine the success of the surgery.  Residual spikes on the ECoG, unaltered by the resection, indicate poor seizure control, and incomplete neutralization of the epileptogenic cortical zone.  Additional surgery may be necessary to completely eradicate seizure activity. Extraoperative ECoG is also used to localize functionally-important areas (also known as eloquent cortex) to be preserved during epilepsy surgery.

;Intraoperative ECoG

The objective of the resectioning surgery is to remove the epileptogenic tissue without causing unacceptable neurological consequences.  In addition to identifying and localizing the extent of epileptogenic zones, ECoG used in conjunction with DCES is also a valuable tool for functional [[cortical stimulation mapping|cortical mapping]].  It is vital to precisely localize critical brain structures, identifying which regions the surgeon must spare during resectioning (the “[[eloquent cortex]]”) in order to preserve sensory processing, motor coordination, and speech.  Functional mapping requires that the patient be able to interact with the surgeon, and thus is performed under local rather than general anesthesia.  Electrical stimulation using cortical and acute depth electrodes is used to probe distinct regions of the cortex in order to identify centers of speech, somatosensory integration, and somatomotor processing.  During the resectioning surgery, intraoperative ECoG may also be performed to monitor the epileptic activity of the tissue and ensure that the entire epileptogenic zone is resectioned.
 
Although the use of extraoperative and intraoperative ECoG in resectioning surgery has been an accepted clinical practice for several decades, recent studies have shown that the usefulness of this technique may vary based on the type of epilepsy a patient exhibits.  Kuruvilla and Flink reported that while intraoperative ECoG plays a critical role in tailored temporal lobectomies, in multiple subpial transections (MST), and in the removal of malformations of cortical development (MCDs), it has been found impractical in standard resection of medial [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] (TLE) with MRI evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS).&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2003"/&gt; A study performed by Wennberg, Quesney, and Rasmussen demonstrated the presurgical significance of ECoG in frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) cases.&lt;ref name="Wennberg 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= R |last1= Wennberg |first2= F |last2= Quesney |first3= A |last3= Olivier |first4= T |last4= Rasmussen | year = 1998 | title = Electrocorticography and outcome in frontal lobe epilepsy |journal= [[Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology]] | volume =106 | pages = 357–68 | url = | doi = 10.1016/S0013-4694(97)00148-X | pmid = 9741764 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research applications==

ECoG has recently emerged as a promising recording technique for use in [[brain-computer interface]]s (BCI).&lt;ref name="Shenoy 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= P |last1= Shenoy |first2= KJ |last2= Miller |first3= JG |last3= Ojemann |first4= RPN |last4= Rao| year = 2007 | title = Generalized features for electrocorticographic BCIs |journal= [[IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society#Journals|IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering]] |volume= 55 |issue= 1 |pages= 273–80 |pmid= 18232371 |doi= 10.1109/TBME.2007.903528 |url= http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rao/gen-features-ecog-bcis-08.pdf |via= http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rao/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141214114400/http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rao/gen-features-ecog-bcis-08.pdf |archivedate= 2014-12-14 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; BCIs are direct neural interfaces that provide control of prosthetic, electronic, or communication devices via direct use of the individual’s brain signals.  Brain signals may be recorded either invasively, with recording devices implanted directly into the cortex, or noninvasively, using EEG scalp electrodes.  ECoG serves to provide a partially invasive compromise between the two modalities – while ECoG does not penetrate the [[blood–brain barrier]] like invasive recording devices, it features a higher spatial resolution and higher signal-to-noise ratio than EEG.&lt;ref name="Shenoy 2007"/&gt;

==Recent advances in ECoG technology==

The electrocorticogram is still considered to be the "[[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]]" for defining epileptogenic zones; however, this procedure is risky and highly invasive.  Recent studies have explored the development of a noninvasive cortical imaging technique for presurgical planning that may provide similar information and resolution of the invasive ECoG.

In one novel approach, Bin He et al.&lt;ref name="Ding  2007"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= L |last1= Ding |first2= C |last2= Wilke |first3= B |last3= Xu |first4= X |last4= Xu |first5= W |last5= van Drongelen |first6= M |last6= Kohrman |first7= B |last7= He |displayauthors= 4 | year = 2007 | title = EEG source imaging: Correlating source locations and extents with electrocorticography and surgical resections in epilepsy patients | journal = [[Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology]]  | volume = 24 | pages = 130–136| url = | doi = 10.1097/WNP.0b013e318038fd52 | pmid = 17414968 | issue = 2 | pmc = 2758789 }}&lt;/ref&gt; seek to integrate the information provided by a structural MRI and scalp EEG to provide a noninvasive alternative to ECoG.  This study investigated a high-resolution subspace source localization approach, FINE (first principle vectors) to image the locations and estimate the extents of current sources from the scalp EEG.  A thresholding technique was applied to the resulting tomography of subspace correlation values in order to identify epileptogenic sources.  This method was tested in three pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy, with encouraging clinical results.  Each patient was evaluated using structural MRI, long-term video EEG monitoring with scalp electrodes, and subsequently with subdural electrodes.  The ECoG data were then recorded from implanted subdural electrode grids placed directly on the surface of the cortex.  MRI and computed tomography images were also obtained for each subject.

The epileptogenic zones identified from preoperative EEG data were validated by observations from postoperative ECoG data in all three patients.  These preliminary results suggest that it is possible to direct surgical planning and locate epileptogenic zones noninvasively using the described imaging and integrating methods.  EEG findings were further validated by the surgical outcomes of all three patients.  After surgical resectioning, two patients are seizure-free and the third has experienced a significant reduction in seizures.  Due to its clinical success, FINE offers a promising alternative to preoperative ECoG, providing information about both the location and extent of epileptogenic sources through a noninvasive imaging procedure.

'''Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham''' (baptised 1614 – 23 July 1666 [[Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates|O.S.]]) was an [[English people|English]] [[Peerage of England|peer]] of the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref name=burke1831p576&gt;{{Harvnb|Burke|1831|p=576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He succeeded to the title 14 October 1617 on the death in infancy of his elder brother [[Henry Willoughby, 4th Baron Willoughby of Parham|Henry Willoughby, 4th Lord Willoughby of Parham]]. Francis Willoughby was second son of [[William Willoughby, 3rd Baron Willoughby of Parham|William Willoughby, 3rd Lord Willoughby of Parham]] The young and unexpected death of his elder brother Henry made Francis successor to the hereditary peerage and seat in the [[House of Lords]], the upper house of Parliament.&lt;ref name=burke1831p577&gt;{{Harvnb|Burke|1831|p=577}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Willoughby was an early supporter of the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarian]] cause during the [[English Civil War]] but later became a [[Cavalier|Royalist]]. He twice served as governor of English colonies in the [[Caribbean]]. Francis Willoughby died without male heirs of his body and the title passed to his younger brother [[William Willoughby, 6th Baron Willoughby of Parham|William Willoughby, 6th Lord Willoughby of Parham]], the third son of [[William Willoughby, 3rd Baron Willoughby of Parham|William Willoughby, 3rd Lord Willoughby of Parham]].

==Background==
Francis Willoughby was born in perhaps late 1613 (since he was baptised in 1614) to [[William Willoughby, 3rd Baron Willoughby of Parham]] and Frances Manners, daughter of [[John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland]] of [[Nottingham]] at Parham in [[Suffolk]].&lt;ref name=DNBfw&gt;[https://www.ancestry.com/interactive/1981/47596_83024005549_1441-00514/109412?

Dictionary of National Biography, 1921–1922, Oxford University Press, London, England.&lt;/ref&gt; His father died in 1617, and the barony was held by his older brother [[Henry Willoughby, 4th Baron Willoughby of Parham|Henry]] for one year until he too died barely five years old,&lt;ref name=DNBfw /&gt; at which point Francis inherited the seat in the [[House of Lords]] and with it the family title.

On 16 November 1628 Willoughby married Elizabeth Cecil (1606–1661), the daughter of the soldier [[Edward Cecil, 1st Viscount Wimbledon]] and Theodosia Noel.

As tensions between the king and Parliament grew in the 1630s, he found himself opposed to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] over the levying of [[ship money]]. His loyalty was further strained by the [[Bishops' Wars]], in which he was reluctant to fight the [[Scotland|Scots]].

==Parliamentary Commander==
When the king in 1642 issued his [[Commission of Array]] to form a loyal army, Willoughby rejected his summons and instead took command of a horse regiment under the Parliamentary commander, the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. By January 1643 he was made commander-in-chief of [[Lincolnshire]].

On 16 July of the same year, he led his soldiers in a surprise attack on [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] where he seized the town. Facing a counterattack, Willoughby's soldiers fought along with those under [[Oliver Cromwell]] to hold off an advancing Royalist force of superior strength. The main body of the Parliamentary army withdrew to [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]] with only two dead.

That September, Willoughby was a subordinate commander under the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]] and Cromwell. He fought at the [[Battle of Winceby]] and accepted the surrender of [[Bolingbroke Castle]] in November.

Willoughby's relations with the Parliamentarians began to fray in 1644. In March he joined with [[Sir John Meldrum]] in the assault on [[Newark, England|Newark]], the failure of which has been partially attributed to Willoughby's supposed unwillingness to take orders from Meldrum. Willoughby quarrelled with Manchester and was forced to make an apology to the [[House of Lords]] as a result. Furthermore, Cromwell himself saw fit to complain about the conduct of Willoughby's soldiers.

In the next few years, Willoughby became the leader of the [[Presbyterian]] force within Parliament, opposed the formation of the [[New Model Army]] and was elected as speaker of the House of Lords in July, 1647. However, when the Parliamentary army took [[London]] in September, Willoughby was imprisoned along with six other peers and held for four months at which point he was released without charge, fleeing to the [[Netherlands]] to join the Royalists.

==Royalist Supporter==
Now espousing the Royalist cause, Willoughby was promoted to [[Vice Admiral]] under the [[James II of England|Duke of York]], an appointment that may have been designed to engender sympathy among Scots and Presbyterians. He was also assigned a command in the  1648  invasion of England under the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]]. He later surrendered his naval command to [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]. When Parliament confiscated his estates, he travelled to the Caribbean.

He was appointed [[Governor of Barbados|Governor]] of [[Barbados]] by Charles II.  He arrived at Barbados and took up the appointment in May 1650 and attempted to negotiate the strained politics of that island, which also experienced a division between Royalists and Parliamentarians. During this time he also sent a small colonizing party to [[Suriname]], which established [[Fort Willoughby]] (now [[Paramaribo]]) in honor of the governor.

On 25 October 1651, a seven ship force under Commodore [[George Ayscue]] arrived off Barbados, demanding that the island submit "for the use of the Parliament of England". Willoughby's reply (tellingly addressed to "His Majesty's ship ''Rainbow''") was unyielding, declaring that he knew "no supreme authority over Englishmen but the King". With some 400 horsemen and 6,000 militia, he was prepared to resist any attempt at coercion.

Over the next month Barbados was blockaded. In early December, with the Royalist cause defeated in England, Ayscue began a series of raids against fortifications on the island and was reinforced by a group of thirteen ships bound for Virginia. On 17 December a force of more than 1,000 Barbadian militia was defeated by one of Ayscue's detachments. Governor Willoughby attempted to stem the spread of Parliamentary sympathies by hanging two of the returning militia soldiers and prohibiting the reading of documents from the blockading fleet. The Royalists held out for several more weeks until one of Willoughby's own commanders declared himself for Parliament. A battle was averted by a week of rain, after which Willoughby, perhaps having seen the hopelessness of his cause, sought negotiations. He was replaced as governor but Barbados and the Royalists there were not punished. Additionally, Willoughby's properties in England were restored. He returned to them in August  1652.

==Later years==
While he was twice imprisoned during [[The Protectorate]] for involvement in Royalist intrigues, Willoughby survived the Cromwell years and after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660 he was again appointed to a governorship in the Caribbean, administering the colonies at [[Saint Kitts]], [[Nevis]], [[Montserrat]], and [[Antigua]].

In June  1664 he organized an expedition from Barbados against the small French garrison at [[Saint Lucia]], expelling it under the pretext that a half-[[Island Caribs|Carib]] native had effectively "sold" it to England and establishing a short-lived English colony there.

During the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], Willoughby engaged in another expedition, sailing to the Dutch island of [[Tobago]] in July 1665. Finding a force under the English privateer [[Robert Searle]] already looting the settlement there, he put a stop to the destruction and installed a garrison of fifty men to maintain order.

His last act on behalf of the English crown came in July  1666 when, having learned of the recent French seizure of [[Saint Kitts]], he formed a relief force of two [[Royal Navy]] [[frigate]]s, twelve other large vessels (including commandeered merchant ships), a [[fire ship]], and a [[ketch]], bearing over 1,000 men. He planned to proceed north to Nevis, Montserrat, and Antigua to gather further reinforcements before descending on the French. Leaving Barbados on 28 July, his force prowled off [[Martinique]] and then [[Guadeloupe]], where he sent a frigate to assault the harbor and capture two merchant vessels on 4 August. This success could not be exploited however as that night most of his force was destroyed by a strong hurricane, including the flagship ''Hope'', from which Willoughby did not emerge.

==Will and family relations==
Francis Willoughby and Elizabeth Cecil had four children:
#Diana, married 21 May 1673 [[Heneage Finch, 3rd Earl of Winchilsea]]
#Frances Willoughby (1625 – September 1680) married [[William Brereton, 3rd Baron Brereton]]
#Elizabeth Willoughby (born about 1633 – 1 August 1695) married 28 October 1662 [[Richard Jones, 1st Earl of Ranelagh]]
#William Willoughby (born about 1635); died young and unmarried in his father's lifetime

In his will, he left extensive holdings in [[Barbados]], [[Antigua]], and [[Suriname]] to his children and his nephew [[Henry Willoughby (governor)|Henry Willoughby]] as well as smaller grants of currency or sugar to various associates and servants.

'''Antônio Gonçalves Dias''' ({{IPA-pt|ɐ̃ˈtonju ɡõˈsawvis ˈdʒiɐs}}; August 10, 1823{{snd}}November 3, 1864) was a [[Brazil]]ian [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[poetry|poet]], [[playwright]], [[Ethnography|ethnographer]], [[lawyer]] and [[Linguistics|linguist]]. A major exponent of [[Brazilian literature#Romanticism|Brazilian Romanticism]] and of the literary tradition known as "[[Indianism (arts)|Indianism]]", he is famous for writing "[[Canção do exílio]]" (arguably the most well-known poem of Brazilian literature), the short [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] ''[[I-Juca-Pirama]]'', the unfinished [[Epic poetry|epic]] ''[[Os Timbiras]]'', and many other [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[patriotism|patriotic]] poems that would award him posthumously with the title of [[national poet]] of Brazil. He was also an avid researcher of [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Native Brazilian]] languages and folklore.

He is the patron of the 15th chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Se te amo, não sei!.djvu|thumb|left|200px|alt=|Manuscript of Dias' poem "Se te amo, não sei!", in his own handwriting. From the archives of the [[National Library of Brazil]]]]

Antônio Gonçalves Dias was born in [[Caxias, Maranhão|Caxias]] on August 10, 1823, to a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] father, João Manuel Gonçalves Dias and a ''[[Zambo|cafuza]]'' mother, Vicência Ferreira. After completing his studies in [[Latin]], [[French language|French]] and [[Philosophy]], he went in 1838 to [[Portugal]] to earn a degree in [[Law]] at the [[University of Coimbra]]. There he wrote his most remembered poem, "[[Canção do exílio]]". He graduated in 1845 and returned to Brazil in the same year. He went to [[Rio de Janeiro]], living there until 1854. There he wrote for newspapers&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Gonçalves Dias, Antonio|volume=12|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and began to write the [[drama]] ''Leonor de Mendonça'' in 1846 and his first poetry book, ''Primeiros Cantos'', in 1847. It was very well-received, and Alexandre Herculano wrote an article praising it. Dias finished his play ''Leonor de Mendonça'' also in 1847, and tried to have it performed at the [[Conservatório de Música do Rio de Janeiro]], but the play was not accepted.

In 1848, he wrote two more poetry books: ''Segundos Cantos'' and ''Sextilhas de Frei Antão''. In 1849 he became professor of [[Latin]] and [[History]] at the [[Colégio Pedro II (Rio de Janeiro)|Colégio Pedro II]]. In 1851, he published his last poetry book, ''Últimos Cantos''. In the same year, he travelled to [[Northern Region, Brazil|Northern Brazil]], planning to marry 14-year-old Ana Amélia Ferreira do Vale, to whom he dedicated many of his most famous and beautiful love poems, such as "Seus olhos", "Leviana", "Palinódia" and "Retratação". Ana Amélia was the cousin of Alexandre Teófilo de Carvalho Leal, who in his turn was the brother of [[:pt:Antônio Henriques Leal|Antônio Henriques Leal]], a famous Brazilian journalist, writer, medician, biographer and historian known as the "[[Plutarch]] of [[Cantanhede (Maranhão)|Cantanhede]]". (Both Alexandre and Antônio were very close friends with Dias, and Antônio would edit Dias' posthumous works in 1875, in 6 volumes.) However, the girl's mother did not allow the marriage, quoting Dias' [[mestizo]] origins as a pretext. (This inspired his famous poem "Ainda uma vez – adeus!".) Returning to Rio, he married Olímpia Carolina da Costa later on, having with her a [[stillbirth|stillborn]] daughter. Dias divorced Olímpia in 1856.

From 1854 to 1858, he went to Europe on special missions for the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, where he studied the state of public instruction in the educational institutions there.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In 1856, in [[Leipzig]], he published his three poetry books in a single volume entitled ''Cantos'', wrote the first four cantos of the epic poem ''Os Timbiras'' (that he would leave unfinished) and also published a dictionary of [[Tupi language|Old Tupi]]. Returning to Brazil in 1860, he founded the magazine ''Guanabara'' alongside [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]] and [[Manuel de Araújo Porto-Alegre, Baron of Santo Ângelo|Manuel de Araújo Porto-Alegre]] in 1849, and went on expeditions to [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Negro]] and [[Madeira River|Madeira]] Rivers, as a member of the Scientific Commission of Exploration. In 1862 he returned to [[Rio de Janeiro]], but shortly after went to Europe again. In October 1863 he went to [[Lisbon]], where he translated [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[The Bride of Messina]]'' and some poems by [[Heinrich Heine]].

[[Image:Three brazilian writers 1858.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=|From left to right: Dias, [[Manuel de Araújo Porto-Alegre, Baron of Santo Ângelo|Manuel de Araújo Porto-Alegre]] and [[Gonçalves de Magalhães, Viscount of Araguaia|Gonçalves de Magalhães]], on a picture dating from circa 1858]]

After a short stay in [[France]], he decided to return to Brazil in 1864, in the ship ''Ville de Boulogne''. However, the ship was [[shipwreck|wrecked]] on the Bay of Cumã,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/turismo/noticias/ult338u3924.shtml |title=Gonçalves Dias morreu em naufrágio no baixo de Atins |date= 15 March 2004 |accessdate=22 April 2013|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the shores of Guimarães, [[Maranhão]]. All the passengers but Dias survived the tragedy; he was sleeping in his cabin belowdecks and did not wake up in time to see what was happening; thus he drowned.

Dias had a nephew who was also a poet, [[Teófilo Dias]].

==Legacy==
The city of [[Gonçalves Dias, Maranhão|Gonçalves Dias]], founded in 1958, has this name because its territory formerly belonged to the city of [[Caxias, Maranhão|Caxias]], Dias' hometown. A [[Gonçalves Dias River|river in Paraná]] is named after him, as well as many public squares and streets all over Brazil.

'''Hugo Maurice Julien Claus''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɦyɣoː ˈklʌu̯s}}; 5 April 1929 – 19 March 2008) was a leading [[Belgian literature|Belgian]] author who published under his own name as well as various pseudonyms. Claus' literary contributions spanned the genres of drama, the novel, and poetry; he also left a legacy as a painter and film director. He wrote primarily in Dutch, although he also wrote some poetry in English.

His death by [[euthanasia]], which is legal in Belgium, led to considerable controversy.

==Life==
Hugo Claus was born on 5 April 1929 at Sint-Janshospitaal in [[Bruges]], Belgium.&lt;ref name = "Een virtuoze alleskunner"&gt;[http://www.trouw.nl/achtergrond/deverdieping/article1798837.ece/Een_virtuoze_alleskunner.html "Een virtuoze alleskunner"] (19 March 2008). ''De Verdieping''. Retrieved 18 June 2010. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest of the sons born to Jozef (Joseph) Claus, a printer who had a passion for theater; his mother was Germaine Vanderlinden. Three more sons were born into the family within the subsequent decade: Guido (February 1931 – 9 November 1991), Odo (born January 1934), and Johan (November 1938 – 13 February 2009).

Educated at a boarding school, the young Hugo Claus lived in [[Belgium]] during the German invasion of the country in [[World War II]]. Several of Claus' schoolteachers during the half-decade of the German occupation of the country were right-wing [[Flemish nationalism|nationalists]] eager to support the [[pro-German government]]; his father was briefly held in custody for pro-German activities after the end of the occupation, and Hugo was himself swayed into supporting the pro-German Flemish fascist youth movement.&lt;ref name = "J. M. Coetzee, Guardian 2007"&gt;[[J. M. Coetzee|Coetzee, J. M.]] (24 Feb 2007). [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/24/poetry.jmcoetzee "Stepping Stones".] ''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved 17 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Claus' experience with the wartime nationalist right would later become a source for his 1983 book ''[[The Sorrow of Belgium]]'', a novel which tells the story of Claus' [[alter ego]] Louis Seynaeve.&lt;ref name = "J. M. Coetzee, Guardian 2007"/&gt; A sympathizer of the [[leftism|political left]] at a more mature period in his life, Claus lauded the socialist model after a visit to [[Cuba]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name = "J. M. Coetzee, Guardian 2007"/&gt;

Claus' prominence in literary circles and his debut as a novelist came in 1950, with the publication of his ''De Metsiers'' at age twenty-one. His first published poems had in fact been printed by his father as early as 1947.&lt;ref name = "Ono Bloom, De Verdieping, 2008"&gt;Bloom, Ono (20 March 2008). [http://www.trouw.nl/achtergrond/deverdieping/article1798909.ece "De Vlaamse leeuw is dood: In memoriam Hugo Claus 1929 – 2008"]. ''De Verdieping''. Retrieved 18 June 2010. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in Paris from 1950 until 1952, where he met many of the members of the [[CoBrA]] art movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ua.ac.be/main.aspx?c=*CLAUS&amp;n=24725 |title=Introduction – Studie- en documentatiecentrum Hugo Claus |publisher=University of Antwerp |author=eorges Wildemeersch |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From February 1953 until the beginning of 1955, Hugo Claus lived in Italy where his girlfriend {{ill|Elly Overzier|nl}} (born in 1928) acted in a few films. They were married on 26 May 1955, and had a son, Thomas, on 7 October 1963. In the early 1970s, he had an affair with actress [[Sylvia Kristel]], who was 23 years younger, with whom he had a son, Arthur, in 1975. The relationship ended in 1977, when she left him for actor [[Ian McShane]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7308618.stm | work=BBC News | title=Author Claus dies by euthanasia | date=21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a "contrarian", of "anarchist spirit".{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Journalist Guy Duplat recalls that Claus had organized in [[Knokke]] the election of a "Miss Knokke Festival", which was a typical beauty contest, except for the Claus ruling that the members of the all-male jury would have to be naked.&lt;ref name="Revue"/&gt;

===Literary career===

Hugo Claus was considered to be one of the most important contemporary Belgian authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtbf.be/info/societe/ARTICLE_168325 Radio-Television Belge RTBF (French)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320120924/http://www.rtbf.be/info/societe/ARTICLE_168325 |date=20 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ledevoir.com/2008/03/20/181368.html|title=Le Devoir|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-croix.com/|title=La Croix - Actualité à la Une en France, en Europe et dans le Monde|first=|last=La-Croix.com|website=La Croix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claus published the novel ''Schola Nostra'' (1971) under the pseudonym Dorothea Van Male. He also used the pseudonyms Jan Hyoens and Thea Streiner. The 1962 ''De verwondering'' (''The Astonishment'') and the 1983 ''Het verdriet van België'' (''[[The Sorrow of Belgium]]'') rank among Claus' most significant works as a novelist.&lt;ref name = "Hugo Brems 2001"&gt;Brems, Hugo (2007). "Claus, Hugo (1929–)". In Bernard A. Cook (Ed.), ''Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia'', Volume 1 (pp. 204–205). London: Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|0-8153-1336-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee views ''Het verdriet van België'' as a postmodern critique of national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, M. (2002). National Identity and Its Construction: The Codification of Flemish Identity Illustrated through ''Het verdriet van België'' by Hugo Claus. ''Dutch Crossing: A Journal of Low Countries Studies'', 26(2), 212–232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most prolific in literary endeavors as a dramatist, Claus wrote 35 original pieces and 31 translations from English, Greek, Latin, French and Spanish plays and novels. His dramatic sketch ''Masscheroen'' was first staged at [[Knokke Casino]] and featured an all-nude cast: three naked men were given the task of portraying the Christian [[Holy Trinity]] of [[God the father]], [[God the son]], and the [[Holy Spirit]]; the work also made light of the [[Holy Virgin]], a Belgian [[saint]], and the [[Three Wise Men]].&lt;ref name = "Willinger Introduction 2007"&gt;Willinger, David (2007). "Introduction". In Hugo Claus, ''The Sacrament and Other Plays of Forbidden Love'' (pp. 11–80). Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania: Susquehanna University Press. {{ISBN|978-1-57591-110-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attacked as [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] and deleterious to the public's moral well-being, the light-hearted play's performance triggered a notable legal case in which Claus was prosecuted: convicted on charges of public indecency, Claus was ordered to pay a ten-thousand-[[Belgian franc]] fine and serve a four-month prison sentence.&lt;ref name = "Een virtuoze alleskunner"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "J. M. Coetzee, Guardian 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Willinger Introduction 2007"/&gt; The prison term was reduced to a [[suspended sentence]] after a public outcry.&lt;ref name = "J. M. Coetzee, Guardian 2007"/&gt;

Claus also wrote the script of a [[satire|satirical]] comic strip, "De Avonturen van Belgman" ("The Adventures of Belgian Man") in 1967, which spoofed the Belgian bi-lingual troubles. The strip itself was drawn by artist ''Hugoké'' (Hugo de Kempeneer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluesonline.weebly.com/de-avonturen-van-belgman.html|title=De avonturen van Belgman|website=Blues Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugo Claus' name had been put forward many times for  the [[Nobel Prize in literature]], on which he would casually comment "this prize money would suit me fine".&lt;ref name="Revue"&gt;[http://blogrtbf.typepad.com/matin_premiere/2008/03/2003---revue-de.html Revue de la presse belge (French)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420155214/http://blogrtbf.typepad.com/matin_premiere/2008/03/2003---revue-de.html |date=20 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painting and film===
As a painter, Claus was a participant in the CoBrA art movement from 1950. He had developed friendships with some of its members, and illustrated a book by [[Pierre Alechinsky]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="jaski"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jaski.nl/CoBrAKunstenaars/HugoClaus/tabid/188/Default.aspx |title=Hugo Claus |publisher=Jaski Art Gallery |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206125235/http://www.jaski.nl/CoBrAKunstenaars/HugoClaus/tabid/188/Default.aspx |archivedate=6 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He collaborated with key figures in the movement including [[Karel Appel]] and [[Guillaume Cornelis van Beverloo|Corneille]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.researchportal.be/en/project/hugo-claus-s-position-as-poet-painter-in-flemish-dutch-experimentalism-1947-1955--(UA_4543)/ |title=Hugo Claus's position as poet-painter in Flemish/Dutch experimentalism (1947–1955) |publisher=University of Antwerp |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and participated in some exhibitions.&lt;ref name="jaski" /&gt; He later used his experiences of this time in his book ''Een zachte vernieling'' (''Mild Destruction'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nlpvf.nl/book/book2.php?Book=657 |title=Hugo Claus: Mild Destruction (Een zachte vernieling) |publisher=NLPVF – Foundation for the Production and Translation of Dutch Literature |accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claus directed seven films between 1964 and 2001. His film ''[[The Sacrament (1989 film)|Het sacrament]]'' was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1990 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/193/year/1990.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Sacrament |accessdate=2009-08-07 |work=festival-cannes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004074037/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/193/year/1990.html |archivedate=4 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Claus suffered from [[Alzheimer's]] disease and requested his life to be terminated through [[euthanasia]], a legal procedure in Belgium, at the Middelheim Hospital in [[Antwerp]] on 19 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf19032008_071|title=Hugo Claus overleden|first=|last=svh|website=De Standaard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bert Anciaux]], then Flemish Minister of Culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vlaanderen.be/nl/vlaamse-regering/regeringen-peeters|title=Regeringen Peeters|date=2014-09-10|work=Vlaanderen.be|access-date=2018-03-03|language=nl-BE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  stated "I knew him well enough to know that he wanted to depart with pride and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/culture/livres/0,,3782747,00-hugo-claus-ets-mort-belges-sont-chagrin-.html LCI (French)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321010954/http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/culture/livres/0,,3782747,00-hugo-claus-ets-mort-belges-sont-chagrin-.html |date=21 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Belgian Prime Minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]] said that he imagined the onset of Alzheimer's must have been "inevitable and unbearable torture". "I can live with the fact that he decided thus," he said, "because he left us as a great glowing [[star]], right on time, just before he would have collapsed into a [[Stellar black hole]]."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

His death by euthanasia has received criticism from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the Belgian Alzheimer League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alzheimerliga.be/|title=Welkom - Alzheimer Liga vzw|website=www.alzheimerliga.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic Church]] criticized the media coverage; Belgian Cardinal [[Godfried Danneels]] referred to Claus' euthanasia in his Easter Homily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/7q1pp3tn|title=Kardinaal Danneels: 'de dood omzeilen is geen heldendaad'|website=De Standaard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian Alzheimer League respects Claus' decision, but believes the media coverage of his death neglects other options for Alzheimer's patients.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

''' Ilya (Elias) Leontievich Rabinovich (Rabinowitsch, Rabinovitch, Rabinovitz, Rabinowicz, Rabinovici) ''' ({{lang-ru|Илья Рабинович}}; 11 May 1891, [[Saint Petersburg]] – 23 April 1942, [[Perm]]) was a Russian / Soviet [[chess]] master, among the best Russian and Soviet players for three decades, from 1910 to 1940. His best result was a shared first place in the 9th Soviet Championship of 1934-35. He was also a chess writer.

==Biography==
In 1911 Ilya Rabinovich tied for first place with Platz in Saint Petersburg. In 1912 he tied for 4th-5th in [[Vilnius]] (Hauptturnier; [[Karel Hromádka]] won).

===Interned in Germany===
In July/August 1914 he played in [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]] (19th DSB Congress), and tied for 2nd-3rd in interrupted ''Hauptturnier A'' ([[Hallegua (chess player)|B. Hallegua]] won).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.de/nachrichten.asp?newsid=5003 Schach Nachrichten&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After the declaration of war for [[World War I]] against Russia, eleven 'Russian' players ([[Alexander Alekhine]], [[Efim Bogoljubow]], [[Fedor Bogatyrchuk]], [[Alexander Flamberg]], N. Koppelman, [[Boris Maljutin]], Rabinovich, [[Peter Romanovsky]], [[Peter Petrovich Saburov]], [[Alexey Selezniev]], and [[Samuil Weinstein]]) from the Mannheim tournament were interned by Germany. In September 1914, four of them (Alekhine, Bogatyrchuk, Saburov, and Koppelman) were freed and allowed, through [[Switzerland]], to return home.

'''Joyce Carol Vincent''' (19 October 1965 – [[Circa|c]]. December 2003) was a British woman whose death went unnoticed for more than two years as her corpse lay undiscovered in her London [[bedsit]]. Prior to her death, Vincent had cut off nearly all contact with those who knew her. She resigned from her job in 2001, and moved into a shelter for victims of [[domestic abuse]]. Around the same time, she began to reduce contact with friends and family. She died in her bedsit around December 2003 with neither family, co-workers, nor neighbours taking notice. Her remains were discovered on 25 January 2006, with the cause of death believed to be either an [[asthma]] attack or complications from a recent [[peptic ulcer]].

Her life and death were the topic of ''[[Dreams of a Life]]'', a 2011 [[docudrama]] film. The film and Vincent's life inspired musician [[Steven Wilson]]'s album ''[[Hand. Cannot. Erase.]]'' as well as the band [[Miss Vincent]]'s name and first single, titled "No One Knew".

==Life==
Joyce Vincent was born in [[Hammersmith]] on 19 October 1965 and raised near [[Fulham Palace]] Road.&lt;ref name=how&gt;{{cite news|last=Morley|first=Carol|title=Joyce Carol Vincent: How could this young woman lie dead and undiscovered for almost three years?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/09/joyce-vincent-death-mystery-documentary|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents had immigrated to London from the island country of [[Grenada]]; her father Lawrence was a carpenter of African descent and her mother Lyris was of Indian descent.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt; Following an operation, her mother died when Vincent was eleven, and her four older sisters took responsibility for her upbringing.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Vincent|url=http://www.b4eonline.com/bizarreglobe/cases/unexplaineddeaths/joycevincent.php|publisher=Bizarre Globe|accessdate=4 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221065438/http://www.b4eonline.com/bizarreglobe/cases/unexplaineddeaths/joycevincent.php|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a strained relationship with her emotionally distant father, who she claimed had died in 2001 (he actually died in 2004).&lt;ref name=holdenny&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|title=Lost to Her Friends, but There All the Time|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/03/movies/dreams-of-a-life-looks-at-joyce-vincent.html|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|last=Macdonald|first=Kevin|title=Carol Morley vs Kevin Macdonald: video interview exclusive|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/carol-morley-vs-kevin-macdonald-video-interview-exclusive|work=Time Out London|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended Melcombe Primary School and Fulham Gilliatt School for Girls, and left school at age sixteen with no qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|FfY0K-toxGM|Dreams Of A Life - Interview with the Director Carol Morley on BYOD at [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] Film Fest}} 25-05-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Vincent began working as a secretary at [[Overseas Containers Limited|OCL]] in the [[City of London]].&lt;ref name="how"/&gt; She then worked at [[Itochu|C.Itoh]] and [[Law Debenture]] before joining [[Ernst &amp; Young]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; She worked in the treasury department of Ernst &amp; Young for four years, but resigned in March 2001 for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt;
Shortly afterwards, Vincent spent some time in a domestic abuse shelter in [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]] and worked as a cleaner in a [[Hotel#Economy and limited service|budget hotel]].&lt;ref name="how"/&gt; During this period, she became estranged from her family.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite news|last=Dawar|first=Anil|title=Body of woman left to rot in her flat for two years|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1515664/Body-of-woman-left-to-rot-in-her-flat-for-two-years.html|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=Daily Telegraph (London)|date=14 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A source involved in the investigation said: "She detached herself from her family but there was no bust up. They are a really nice family. We understand she was in a relationship and there was a history of domestic violence."&lt;ref name=knight&gt;{{cite news|last=Knight|first=India|title=The dark side of Bridget|newspaper=Sunday Times|date=16 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that she was ashamed to be a victim of domestic abuse or did not want to be traced by her abuser.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite news|title=A life lived alone in a city of millions|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/film/a-life-lived-alone-in-a-city-of-millions.1325127732|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=Glasgow Herald|date=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a victim of domestic violence, Vincent was moved into a [[bedsit]] flat above [[The Mall Wood Green|Wood Green Shopping City]] in February 2003.&lt;ref name=edwards&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Richard|title=Body in flat for 2 years: TV was still on|newspaper=Evening Standard|date=13 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flat was owned by the [[Metropolitan Housing Trust]] and was used to house victims of abuse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|title=Woman's body in bedsit for years|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4906992.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2003, after vomiting blood, she was hospitalised for two days due to a [[peptic ulcer]] at North Middlesex Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenbaum|first=Martin|title=Freedom of Information request|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/opensecrets/Vincent.pdf|work=BBC|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Vincent died of unknown causes around December 2003.&lt;ref name=edwards /&gt; She was an [[asthma]] sufferer, and an [[asthma attack]], or complications surrounding her recent [[peptic ulcer]], have been suggested as a possible cause of death.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Her remains were described as "mostly skeletal" according to the pathologist, and she was lying on her back, next to a shopping bag, surrounded by Christmas presents she had wrapped but never delivered.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; It is not known to whom the presents were addressed, and the police report regarding the case has been disposed of.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{YouTube|ElqCfBJAFoE|Sheffield Doc/Fest 2012: Carol Morley in Conversation with Guardian Critic Peter Bradshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbours had assumed the flat was unoccupied, and the odour of decomposing body tissue was attributed to nearby waste bins.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The flat's windows did not allow direct sight into the accommodation.&lt;ref name=windows&gt;{{cite news|last=Gillan|first=Audrey|title=Body of woman, 40, lay unmissed in flat for more than two years|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/apr/14/audreygillan.uknews2|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug addicts frequented the area, which may explain why no one questioned the constant noise from the television.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Half of her rent was being automatically paid to Metropolitan Housing Trust by benefits agencies, leading officials to believe that she was still alive.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; However, over two years, £2,400 in unpaid rent accrued, and housing officials decided to repossess the property.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; Her corpse was discovered on 25 January 2006 when bailiffs had forced entry into the flat.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The television and heating were still running due to her bills being continually paid for by automatic debit payments and [[debt forgiveness]].&lt;ref name=indyduff&gt;{{cite news|last=Duff|first=Oliver|title=Woman lay dead in her flat for more than two years|newspaper=The Independent|date=14 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dialectmagazine.com/2012/02/dreams-of-a-life-a-glimpse-into-a-golden-apple-film/ Dreams of a Life: A Glimpse into a Golden Apple], ''Dialect Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Metropolitan Housing Trust said that due to housing benefits covering the costs of rent for some period after Vincent's death, arrears had not been realised until much later.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The Trust also said that no concerns were raised by neighbours or visitors at any time during the two years between her death and discovery of the body.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Vincent's remains were too badly decomposed to conduct a full [[post-mortem]], and she had to be identified from dental records.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Police ruled death by natural causes as there was nothing to suggest foul play: the front door was double locked and there was no sign of a break-in.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1409|title=Latest Film Reviews - Movie News - Features - Interviews - Empire|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of her death she had a boyfriend, but the police were unable to trace him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itzcaribbean.com/dreams-of-a-life-carol-morley.php Dreams of a Life | Filmmaker Carol Morley&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131118102030/http://www.itzcaribbean.com/dreams-of-a-life-carol-morley.php |date=18 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sisters had hired a private detective to look for her and contacted the [[Salvation Army]], but these attempts proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The detective found the house where Vincent was living, and the family wrote letters to her. But as she was already dead by this time, they received no response, and the family assumed that she had deliberately broken ties with them.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{YouTube|fYVPhvbL7v0|DocHouse 'Dreams of A Life' Q&amp;A with Carol Morley 24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Glasgow Herald'' reported, &lt;blockquote&gt;"...her friends noted her as someone who fled at signs of trouble, who walked out of jobs if she clashed with a colleague, and who moved from one flat to the next all over London. She didn't answer the phone to her sister and didn't appear to have her own circle of friends, instead relying on the company of relative strangers who came with the package of a new boyfriend, a colleague, or flatmate."&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Dreams of a Life''==
{{Main|Dreams of a Life}}
A film about Vincent, ''Dreams of a Life'', written and directed by [[Carol Morley]] with [[Zawe Ashton]] playing Vincent, was released in 2011.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt; Morley tracked down and interviewed people who had known Vincent. They described a beautiful, intelligent, socially active woman, "upwardly mobile" and "a high flyer", whom they assumed "was off somewhere having a better life than they were".&lt;ref name="how"/&gt; During her life, she met figures such as [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Ben E. King]], [[Gil Scott-Heron]], and [[Betty Wright]], and had also been to dinner with [[Stevie Wonder]].&lt;ref name="how"/&gt;

==Steven Wilson album==
{{Main|Hand. Cannot. Erase.}}
On 4 November 2014, English musician [[Steven Wilson]] announced that his fourth CD release, titled ''Hand. Cannot. Erase.'', would be based on the life of Vincent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stevenwilsonhq.com/sw/steven-wilson-at-air-studios-part-2-concept-and-inspiration/ Steven Wilson at Air Studios – Part 2: Concept and Inspiration | StevenWilsonHQ.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] Retrieved June 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilson, he was inspired to create a concept album after seeing ''Dreams of a Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/steven_wilson_explains_new_albums_concept_and_inspiration_shares_fresh_music_in_new_clip.html|title=Steven Wilson Explains New Album's Concept and Inspiration, Shares Fresh Music in New Clip|work=[[Ultimate-Guitar.Com]]|date=February 11, 2014|accessdate=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the book that accompanied the deluxe release of the album it is clear that the central character is a highly fictionalised version of Vincent: she is born on 8 October 1978 to an Italian mother and dies or disappears 22 December 2014. Her only sister is a girl, 'J.', who was briefly fostered by her parents prior to their divorce. In the album and book the Christmas presents are intended for H.'s estranged brother and his family.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Wilson, Hand. Cannot. Erase. Deluxe edition with insert facsimile documents. Kscope, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miss Vincent==
{{Main|Miss Vincent}}
After hearing about the story of Vincent, the vocalist of [[Miss Vincent]], Alex Marshall, was inspired to write a song about her life. The song was first titled Miss Vincent but the band eventually decided to change the song's title to No One Knew and name their band itself to [[Miss Vincent]]. This was the band's first single and it was released on 5 October 2012.

'''Limerence''' is a state of mind which results from a [[Romance (love)|romantic attraction]] to another person and typically includes obsessive thoughts and fantasies and a desire to form or maintain a relationship with the object of love and have one's feelings reciprocated.

==Origin and meaning of the term==
[[Psychologist]] [[Dorothy Tennov]] coined the term "limerence" for her 1979 book, ''Love and Limerence:  The Experience of Being in Love'', to describe a concept that had grown out of her work in the mid-1960s, when she interviewed over 500 people on the topic of love.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tennov|first=Dorothy|authorlink=Dorothy Tennov|title=Love and Limerence: the Experience of Being in Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPsDAAAACAAJ|accessdate=12 March 2011|year=1999|publisher=Scarborough House|isbn=978-0-8128-6286-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence, which is not exclusively sexual, has been defined in terms of its potentially inspirational effects and in relation to [[attachment theory]]. It has been described as being "an involuntary potentially inspiring state of adoration and attachment to a limerent object (LO) involving [[Intrusive thought|intrusive]] and obsessive thoughts, feelings and behaviors from euphoria to despair, contingent on perceived emotional reciprocation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Willmott|first=Lynn|title=Love and Limerence: Harness the Limbicbrain| year= 2012| publisher= Lathbury House|isbn= 978-1481215312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attachment theory emphasizes that "many of the most intense [[emotion]]s arise during the formation, the maintenance, the disruption, and the renewal of attachment relationships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first= John |last= Bowlby| title= Attachment| editor-first= Richard |editor-last= Gregory |work= The Oxford Companion to the Mind| publisher= Oxford |year= 1987| page= 57}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that "the state of limerence is the conscious experience of sexual incentive motivation" during attachment formation, "a kind of subjective experience of sexual incentive motivation"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agmo|2007|pp=173, 186}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the "intensive ... pair-forming stage"&lt;ref name="Morris1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; of human affectionate bonding.

==Characteristics==
The concept of 'limerence' "provides a particular carving up of the semantic domain of love",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=V. C. |editor-last=De Munck|title=Romantic Love and Sexual Behavior |year=1998 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represents an attempt at a scientific study of the nature of love. Limerence is considered as a [[cognitive]] and emotional state of being emotionally attached to or even obsessed with another person, and is typically experienced involuntarily and characterized by a strong desire for reciprocation of one's feelings—a near-obsessive form of [[Romance (love)|romantic love]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite journal

|accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Tennov, "sexual attraction is an essential component of limerence ... the limerent is a potential sex partner".&lt;ref name="Tennov"&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence is sometimes also interpreted as [[infatuation]], or what is colloquially known as a "crush".  However, in common speech, infatuation includes aspects of immaturity and extrapolation from insufficient information, and is usually short-lived.  Tennov notes how limerence "may dissolve soon after its initiation, as in an early teenage buzz-centered crush",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she is more concerned with the point when "limerent bonds are characterized by 'entropy' crystallization as described by [[Stendhal]] in his 1821 treatise ''On Love'', where a new love infatuation perceptually begins to transform ... [and] attractive characteristics are exaggerated and unattractive characteristics are given little or no attention ... [creating] a 'limerent object'".

According to Tennov, there are at least two types of love: limerence, which she describes as, among other things, "loving attachment", and "loving affection", the bond that exists between an individual and their parents and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/dec/14/features.magazine47 |work= The Guardian |title= That crazy little thing called love |date= 14 December 2003 |accessdate= 15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that one form may evolve into the other: "Those whose limerence was replaced by affectional bonding with the same partner might say ... 'We were very much in love when we married; today we love each other very much'".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction is comparable to that drawn by [[ethologists]] "between the pair-forming and pair-maintaining functions of sexual activity",&lt;ref name="Morris1994" /&gt; just as "the attachment of the attachment theorists is very similar to the emotional reciprocation longed for in Tennov's limerence, and each is linked to sexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1998|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence is characterized by [[Intrusive thoughts|intrusive thinking]] and pronounced sensitivity to external events that reflect the disposition of the limerent object towards the individual. It can be experienced as intense [[joy]] or as extreme [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], depending on whether the feelings are reciprocated. Basically, it is the state of being completely carried away by unreasoned [[passion (emotion)|passion]] or [[love]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} even to the point of [[Addiction|addictive]]-type behavior. Usually, one is inspired with an intense passion or admiration for someone. Limerence can be difficult to understand for those who have never experienced it, and it is thus often dismissed by non-limerents as ridiculous fantasy or a construct of romantic fiction.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt;

Tennov differentiates between limerence and other emotions by asserting that [[love]] involves concern for the other person's welfare and feeling. While limerence does not require it, those concerns may certainly be incorporated. [[Affection]] and fondness exist only as a disposition towards another person, irrespective of whether those feelings are reciprocated, whereas limerence deeply desires reciprocation, but it remains unaltered whether or not it is returned. Physical contact with the object is neither essential nor sufficient to an individual experiencing limerence, unlike with one experiencing [[sexual attraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa|title=Emerging Perspectives on Distinctions Between Romantic Love and Sexual Desire|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=13|page=2|url=http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003453/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where early, unhealthy attachment patterns or [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] influence limerence, the limerent object may be construed as an idealization of the figure or figures involved in the original unhealthy attachment or trauma. Lack of reciprocation may in such instances serve to reinforce lessons learned in earlier, unhealthy bonding experiences, and hence strengthen the limerence.

==Components==
Limerence involves intrusive thinking about the limerent object.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; Other characteristics include acute longing for reciprocation, fear of rejection, and unsettling shyness in the limerent object's presence. In cases of unrequited limerence, transient relief may be found by vividly imagining reciprocation from the limerent object. Tennov suggests that feelings of limerence can be intensified through adversity, obstacles, or distance—'Intensification through Adversity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; A limerent person may have acute sensitivity to any act, thought, or condition that can be interpreted favorably. This may include a tendency to devise, fabricate, or invent "reasonable" explanations for why neutral actions are a sign of hidden passion in the limerent object.

A person experiencing limerence has a general intensity of feeling that leaves other concerns in the background. In their thoughts, such a person tends to emphasize what is admirable in the limerent object and to avoid any negative or problematic attributes.

===Intrusive thinking and fantasy===
During the height of limerence, thoughts of the limerent object (or person) are at once persistent, involuntary and intrusive. Such 'intrusive thoughts about the LO ... appear to be genetically driven':&lt;ref name="moore268"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1998|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, limerence is first and foremost a condition of cognitive obsession. This may be caused by low serotonin levels in the brain, comparable to those of people with [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Marazziti D, Akiskal HS, Rossi A, Cassano GB. "Alteration of the platelet serotonin transporter in romantic love." ''Psychol Med.'' 2000&lt;/ref&gt; All events, associations, stimuli, and experiences return thoughts to the limerent object with unnerving consistency, while conversely the constant thoughts about the limerent object define all other experiences. If a certain thought has no previous connection with the limerent object, immediately one is made. Limerent fantasy is unsatisfactory unless rooted in reality,&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; because the fantasizer may want the fantasy to seem realistic and somewhat possible.  At their most severe, intrusive limerent thoughts can occupy an individual's waking hours completely, resulting—like severe addiction—in significant or complete disruption of the limerent's normal interests and activities, including work and family.  For serial limerents, this can result in debilitating, lifelong underachievement in school, work, and family life.  Comparisons{{which|date=December 2013}} made between limerence and substance addiction may draw attention to the constant, free availability of the limerent's "drug of choice".

Fantasies that are concerned with far-fetched ideas are usually dropped by the fantasizer.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; Sometimes fantasizing is retrospective: actual events are replayed from memory with great vividness. This form predominates when what is viewed as evidence of possible reciprocation can be re-experienced (a kind of selective or revisionist history). Otherwise, the long fantasy is anticipatory; it begins in the everyday world and climaxes at the attainment of the limerent goal. A limerent fantasy can also involve an unusual, often tragic, event.

The long fantasies form bridges between the limerent's ordinary life and that intensely desired ecstatic moment. The duration and complexity of a fantasy depend on the availability of time and freedom from distractions. The bliss of the imagined moment of consummation is greater when events imagined to precede it are possible (though they often represent grave departures from the probable). Not always is it entirely pleasant, and when rejection seems likely the thoughts focus on despair, sometimes to the point of [[suicide]]. The pleasantness or unpleasantness of the state seems almost unrelated to the intensity of the reaction. Although the direction of feeling, i.e. happy versus unhappy, shifts rapidly, with 'dramatic surges of buoyancy and despair',&lt;ref name=moore268/&gt; the intensity of intrusive and involuntary thinking alters less rapidly, and only in response to an accumulation of experiences with the particular limerent object.

Fantasies are occasionally dreamed by the one experiencing limerence. Dreams give out strong emotion and happiness when experienced, but often end with despair when the subject awakens. Dreams can reawaken strong feelings toward the limerent object after the feelings have declined.

=== Fear of rejection ===
Along with an emphasis on the perceived exceptional qualities, and devotion to them, there is abundant doubt that the feelings are reciprocated: [[social rejection#Romantic rejection|rejection]]. Considerable self-doubt is encountered, leading to "personal incapacitation expressed through unsettling timidity in the presence of the person",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; something which causes misery and galvanizes desire.

In most cases, what destroys limerence is a suitably long period of time without [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocation]]. Although it appears that limerence advances with adversity, personal discomfort may foul it.  This discomfort results from a fear of the limerent object's opinions.

=== Hope ===
Limerence develops and is sustained when there is a certain balance of hope and uncertainty. The basis for limerent hope is not in objective reality but in reality as it is perceived. The inclination is to sift through nuances of speech and [[wikt:subtleties|subtleties]] of behavior for evidence of limerent hope. "Lovers, of course, are notoriously frantic [[epistemologist]]s, second only to paranoiacs (and analysts) as readers of signs and wonders."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Adam. ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; "Little things" are noticed and endlessly analyzed for meaning. Such excessive concern over trivia may not be entirely unfounded, however, as body language can indicate reciprocated feeling. What the limerent object said and did is recalled with vividness. Alternative meanings for the behaviors recalled are sought. Each word and gesture is permanently available for review, especially those interpreted as evidence in favor of reciprocated feeling. When objects, people, places or situations are encountered with the limerent object, they are vividly remembered, especially if the limerent object  interacted with them in some way.

The belief that the limerent object does not and will not reciprocate can only be reached with great difficulty. Limerence can be carried quite far before acknowledgment of rejection is genuine, especially if it has not been addressed openly by the limerent object.

==Effects==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

===Physical effects===
The physiological correlations of intense limerence can include [[seizure]]-like [[trembling]], [[pallor]], [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[heart palpitations]], [[pupil dilation]] and general [[Muscle weakness|weakness]]. [[Awkwardness]], [[stuttering]], [[shyness]], and [[confusion]] predominate at the behavioral level. Less common effects include [[insomnia]], [[loss of appetite]],  and [[Syncope (medicine)|passing out]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

If there is extensive [[anxiety]], incorrect behaviour may torpedo the relationship, which may cause physical responses to manifest intensely. Some people acutely feel these effects either immediately or following contact with the limerent object.  Blended is dire ecstasy or keen despair, depending on the turn of events.

The sensitivity that stems from fear of rejection can darken limerent objects' perceived body language. Conflicted signs of [[desire]] may be emitted that confuse judgment.  Often the limerent object is currently involved with another or is in some other way unavailable.

A condition of sustained alertness, a heightening of awareness and an enormous fund of energy to deploy in pursuit of the limerent aim is developed. The sensation of limerence is felt in the midpoint of the chest, bottom of the throat, guts, or in some cases in the abdominal region.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; This can be interpreted as ecstasy at times of mutuality, but its presence is most noticeable during [[Broken heart|despair at times of rejection]].

===Psychological effects===
Sufferers complain of abandonment, despair, and diabolically humiliating disappointment. A sense of paralyzing ambiguity predominates, punctuated by pining. The fact of intermittent or nonreciprocal response lends to labile vacillation. This [[limbo]] is the threshold for mental prostration.

== Sexuality ==
Awareness of [[physical attraction]] plays a key role in the development of limerence,&lt;ref name="Tennov" /&gt; but is not enough to satisfy the limerent desire, and is almost never the main focus; instead, the limerent focuses on what could be defined as the "beneficial attributes". Nevertheless, Tennov stresses that "the most consistent result of limerence is mating, not merely sexual interaction but also commitment".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence can be intensified after a sexual relationship has begun, and with more intense limerence there is greater desire for sexual contact. However, while sexual surrender at one time indicated the end of uncertainty felt by the limerent object – because in the past, a sexual encounter more often led to a feeling of obligation to commit – in modern times this is not necessarily the case.

The sexual aspect of limerence is not consistent from person to person.  Most limerents experience limerent sexuality as a component of romantic interest.  Some limerents, however, may experience limerence as a consequence of hyperarousal. In such cases, limerence may form as a [[defense mechanism]] against the limerent object, who is not perceived initially as a romantic ideal, but as a physical threat to the limerent.

[[Sexual fantasy|Sexual fantasies]] are distinct from limerent fantasies. Limerent fantasy is rooted in reality and is intrusive rather than voluntary. Sexual fantasies are under more or less voluntary control and may involve strangers, imaginary individuals, and situations that could not take place. Limerence elevates body temperature and increases relaxation{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}, a sensation of viewing the world with [[Optimism|rose-tinted glasses]], leading to a greater receptiveness to sexuality, and to daydreaming.

People can become aroused by the thought of sexual partners, acts, and situations that are not truly desired, whereas every detail of the limerent fantasy is passionately desired actually to take place. Limerence sometimes increases sexual interest in other partners when the limerent object is unreceptive or unavailable.

== Limerent reaction ==
The limerent reaction is a composite reaction – that is, it is composed of a series of separate reactions.  These reactions occur only where misperceptions meet adversity in the context of a romance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  Perhaps because of this unique specificity, limerent reactions can be uniquely quantified and predicted according to the schema described below.

Involvement increases if obstacles are externally imposed or if the limerent object’s feelings are doubted. Only if the limerent object were to be revealed as highly undesirable might limerence subside. The presence of some degree of doubt causes the intensity of the feelings to increase further.  The stage is reached at which the reaction is virtually impossible to dislodge. This adversity may be superficial or deep, internal or external, so that an individual may sometimes generate deep adversity where none exists.  Also "romance", as it were, need not be present in any genuine way for a limerent reaction to occur.

The course of limerence results in a more intrusive thinking pattern. This thinking pattern is an expectant and often joyous period with the initial focusing on the limerent object’s admirable qualities: [[crystallization (love)|crystallization]]. Then, under appropriate conditions of hope and uncertainty, the limerence intensifies further.

With evidence of reciprocation (real or imagined) from the limerent object, a state of extreme pleasure, even euphoria, is enjoyed. Thoughts are mainly occupied with considering and reconsidering what is attractive in the limerent object, replaying whatever events may have thus far transpired with the limerent object, and appreciating personal qualities perceived as possibly having sparked interest in the limerent object. At peak crystallization, almost all waking thoughts revolve around the limerent object. After this peak, the feelings eventually decline.

Fantasies are preferred to virtually any other activity with the exception of activities that are believed to help obtain the limerent object, and activities that involve actually being in the presence of the limerent object. The motivation to attain a "relationship" continues to intensify so long as a proper mix of hope and uncertainty exist.

== Limerent duration ==

Tennov estimates, based on both questionnaire and interview data, that the average limerent reaction duration, from the moment of initiation until a feeling of neutrality is reached, is approximately three years. The extremes may be as brief as a few weeks or as long as several decades. When limerence is brief, maximum intensity may not have been attained. According to David Sack, M.D., limerence lasts longer than romantic love, but is shorter than a healthy, committed partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Others suggest that 'the biogenetic sourcing of limerence determines its limitation, ordinarily, to a two-year span',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; that limerence generally lasts between 18 months and three years; but further studies on unrequited limerence have suggested longer durations. In turn, a limerent may only experience a single limerent episode, or may experience "serial" episodes, in which nearly one's entire mature life, from early puberty through late adulthood, can be consumed in successive limerent obsessions.

== Bond varieties ==
{{Main|Human bonding}}
Once the ''limerent reaction'' has initiated, one of three varieties of bonds may form, defined over a set duration of time, in relation to the experience or non-experience of limerence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa|title=Emerging Perspectives on Distinctions Between Romantic Love and Sexual Desire|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=13|page=1|url=http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003453/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The constitution of these bonds may vary over the course of the relationship, in ways that may either increase or decrease the intensity of the limerence.

The basis and interesting characteristic of this delineation made by Tennov, is that based on her research and interviews with people, all human bonded relationships can be divided into three varieties being defined by the amount of limerence or non-limerence each partner contributes to the relationship.

With an affectional bond, neither partner is limerent. With a Limerent-Nonlimerent bond, one partner is limerent. In a Limerent-Limerent bond, both partners are limerent.

Affectional bonding characterize those affectionate sexual relationships where neither partner is limerent; couples tend to be in love, but do not report continuous and unwanted intrusive thinking, feeling intense need for exclusivity, or define their goals in terms of reciprocity.  These types of bonded couples tend to emphasize compatibility of interests, mutual preferences in leisure activities, ability to work together, and in some cases a degree of relative contentment.

The bulk of relationships, however, according to Tennov, are those between a limerent person and a nonlimerent other, i.e. ''limerent-nonlimerent bonding''.  These bonds are characterized by unequal reciprocation.

Lastly, those relationship bonds in which there exists mutual reciprocation are defined as ''limerent-limerent bondings''.  Tennov argues that since limerence itself is an "unstable state", mutually limerent bonds would be expected to be short-lived; mixed relationships probably last longer than limerent-limerent relationships. Some limerent-limerent relationships evolve into affectional bondings over time as limerence declines.  Tennov describes such couples as "old marrieds" whose interactions are typically both stable and mutually gratifying.

==Mitigation==
In her study Tennov identified three ways in which limerence subsides: 
;Consummation (reciprocation)
:Each limerent has a slightly different view of acceptable reciprocation, and the reactions to reciprocation vary.  Some limerents remain limerent (as documented by Tennov), while for others the limerence subsides as the certainty of reciprocity grows.  Other limerents do not achieve any "real" consummation (e.g. physical, or in the form of an actual relationship) but find their limerence waning after a limerent object professes similar feelings.
;Starvation
:In this process, a lack of ''any'' notice (i.e. starvation, described by Tennov as "the onslaught of evidence that LO does not return the limerence") causes the limerent to gradually desensitize. This desensitization may take a long time, in which case a limerent's latent hypersensitivity may cause any attention given by a former LO, regardless of how slight, to be interpreted as a reason for hope, precipitating a resurgence of limerence.
;Transference
:The limerent transfers their romantic feelings to another person, thereby ending the initial limerence; the limerence is sometimes transferred as well.

==Continuing research==
Tennov's research has been continued{{when|refers to 2008 articles|date=January 2018}} by Albert Wakin, who knew Tennov at the [[University of Bridgeport]] but did not assist in her research, and Duyen Vo, a graduate student of [[Southern Connecticut State University]].&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their goal is to refine the term limerence so that it refers mostly to the negative aspects.

The term "limerence" has been invoked in many popular media,{{according to whom|date=January 2018}} including self-help books, popular magazines, and websites.  However, according to a paper by Wakin and Vo, "In spite of the public’s exposure to limerence, the professional community, particularly clinical, is largely unaware of the concept."&lt;ref name="Wakin-Vo"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Wakin and Vo presented their updated research to the American Association of Behavioral and Social Sciences.  They reported that more research must be gathered before the condition is suitable for inclusion in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (''DSM'').&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;

Critics point out that Tennov's account "is based on interviews rather than on direct observation", but conclude that "despite its shortcomings, Tennov's work may constitute a basis for informed hypothesis formulation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agmo|2007|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article presents a partial list of the most prominent '''[[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi German concentration camps]] and [[extermination camp]]s set up across Europe''' before and during the course of World War II and the [[Holocaust]]. A more complete list drawn up in 1967 by the [[German Ministry of Justice]] names about 1,200 camps and subcamps in [[German-occupied Europe|countries occupied by Germany]],&lt;ref name="bundesrecht"&gt;Bundesministerium der Justiz (2011), [https://web.archive.org/web/20121103180512/http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/begdv_6/anlage_6.html List of concentration camps and their outposts in alphabetical order.] Internet Archive. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Jewish Virtual Library]] writes: "It is estimated that the Germans established 15,000 camps in the occupied countries."&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary1"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/cclist.html ''Concentration Camp Listing''] Sourced from Van Eck, Ludo ''Le livre des Camps.'' Belgium: Editions Kritak; and Gilbert, Martin ''Atlas of the Holocaust.'' New York: William Morrow 1993 {{ISBN|0-688-12364-3}}. In this on-line site are the names of 149 camps and 814 subcamps, organized by country.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the data presented in this table originates from the monograph titled ''[[The War Against the Jews]]'' by [[Lucy Dawidowicz]] among similar others.&lt;ref name="ushmm/search"&gt;Search Results: [http://www.ushmm.org/search/results/?q=concentration+camps  Mapping the SS Concentration Camp System.] Alphabetical listing. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum: Further Reading. Bergen, Dawidowicz, Gilbert, Gutman, Hilberg, Yahil.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933–1939, before the onset of war, most prisoners consisted of German Communists, Socialists, Social Democrats, Roma, Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, and persons accused of 'asocial' or socially 'deviant' behavior by the Germans.&lt;ref name="HEn-2"&gt;''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', [http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005144 Nazi Camps. Introduction.] United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; They were not utilized to sustain the German war effort.

Although the term 'concentration camp' is often used as a general term for all German camps during World War&amp;nbsp;II, there were in fact several types of concentration camps in the German camp system. Holocaust scholars make a clear distinction between death camps and concentration camps which served a number of war related purposes including prison facilities, labor camps, [[prisoner of war]] camps, and transit camps among others.&lt;ref name="V-L"&gt;Peter Vogelsang &amp; Brian B. M. Larsen (2002), [http://www.holocaust-education.dk/lejre/koncudd.asp The difference between concentration camps and extermination camps.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027172336/http://www.holocaust-education.dk/lejre/koncudd.asp |date=2015-10-27 }} The Danish Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concentration camps served primarily as detention and [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave labor exploitation centers]].  An estimated 15 to 20 million people were imprisoned in 42,500 camps and ghettos, and often pressed into slavery during the subsequent years,&lt;ref name="Helman"/&gt; according to research by the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] conducted more recently.&lt;ref name="Helman"&gt;{{cite book |work=Jews and Their Foodways |author=Anat Helman |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2015 |ISBN=0190265426 |pages=251–252 |title=Exploring the Universe of Camps and Ghettos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GrGYCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;vq=Geoffrey%2BMegargee&amp;pg=PA251#v=snippet&amp;q=Geoffrey+Megargee |chapter=''The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos'' by [[Geoffrey P. Megargee]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system of about 20,000 concentration camps in Germany and German-occupied Europe played a pivotal role in economically sustaining the German reign of terror.&lt;ref name="HEn-2"/&gt; Most of them were destroyed by the Germans in an attempt to hide the evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity; nevertheless tens of thousands of prisoners sent on [[death march]]es were liberated by the Allies afterward.&lt;ref name="ushmm.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005131 | title=Liberation of German Camps | publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum | author=Source: Abzug, Bridgman, Chamberlin, Goodell | date=2015 | accessdate=18 July 2015 | work=Holocaust Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Extermination camp]]s were designed and built exclusively to kill prisoners on a massive scale, often immediately upon arrival.&lt;ref name="HEn-1"/&gt; The extermination camps of [[Operation Reinhard]] such as [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]], [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]] and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] served as "death factories" in which German [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and police murdered nearly 2,700,000 Jews by asphyxiation with poison gas, shooting, and [[Extermination through labour|extreme work under starvation conditions]].&lt;ref name="HEn-1"&gt;''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', [http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005145 Killing Centers: An Overview.]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402151811/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005145 |date=2013-04-02 }} United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YV-H"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Yad Vashem]] |title=The Implementation of the Final Solution: The Death Camps |work=The Holocaust |publisher=Yad Vashem, The Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority |date=2012 |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/05/death_camps.asp?WT.mc_id=wiki |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104111022/http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/05/death_camps.asp?WT.mc_id=wiki |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-11-04 |via=Internet Archive, 4 November 2013 |df=dmy-all}} ''Also in:'' {{cite journal |work=Forced and Slave Labor in Nazi-Dominated Europe |url=https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/20060315-forced-slave-labor-symposium.pdf |publisher=Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |year=2004 |title=Jewish Forced Labor as a Basic Element of Nazi Persecution: Germany, Austria, and the Occupied Polish Territories (1938–1943) |author=Wolf Gruner |pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gellately2001"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert Gellately |author2=Nathan Stoltzfus |title=Social Outsiders in Nazi Germany |year=2001 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-08684-2 |page=216 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1toqgWg8ROUC&amp;q=forced+labor#v=snippet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentration camps held large groups of prisoners without trial or judicial process. In modern historiography, the term refers to a place of systemic mistreatment, starvation, forced labour and murder.

'''Living systems''' are open self-organizing life forms that interact with their environment. These systems are maintained by flows of information, [[energy flow (ecology)|energy]] and matter.

Some scientists have proposed in the last few decades that a general living systems theory is required to explain the nature of [[life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Woodruff | first = T. Sullivan | authorlink = |author2=John Baross  | title = Planets and Life: The Emerging Science of Astrobiology | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | date = October 8, 2007 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}
Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory." [...] "Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems".&lt;/ref&gt; Such a general theory, arising out of the [[Ecology|ecological]] and [[Biology|biological sciences]], attempts to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down into components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patterns, Flows, and Interrelationship |url=http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |accessdate=2009-06-27 |first=Molly Young |last=Brown |date=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108122526/http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Living systems theory is a general theory about the existence of all living systems, their [[structure]], [[interaction]], [[behavior]] and [[developmental biology|development]]. This work is created by [[James Grier Miller]], which was intended to formalize the concept of life. According to Miller's original conception as spelled out in his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''Living Systems'', a "living system" must contain each of twenty "critical subsystems", which are defined by their functions and visible in numerous systems, from simple cells to organisms, countries, and societies. In ''Living Systems'' Miller provides a detailed look at a number of systems in order of increasing size, and identifies his subsystems in each. 
Miller considers living systems as a subset of all [[system]]s. Below the level of living systems, he defines [[space]] and [[time]], [[matter]] and [[energy]], [[information]] and [[entropy]], levels of [[organization]], and physical and conceptual factors, and above living systems ecological, planetary and solar systems, galaxies, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Seppänen, 1998, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Living systems according to Parent (1996) are by definition "open self-organizing [[system]]s that have the special characteristics of life and interact with their [[social environment|environment]]. This takes place by means of information and material-energy exchanges. Living systems can be as simple as a single [[cell (biology)|cell]] or as complex as a supranational [[organization]] such as the European Union. Regardless of their [[complexity]], they each depend upon the same essential twenty subsystems (or processes) in order to survive and to continue the propagation of their species or types beyond a single generation".&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Parent, [http://projects.isss.org/the_living_systems_theory_of_james_grier_miller ''The Living Systems Theory of James Grier Miller''], Primer project ISSS, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller said that systems exist at eight "nested" hierarchical levels: cell, organ, organism, group, organization, community, society, and supranational system. At each level, a system invariably comprises twenty critical subsystems, which process matter–energy or information except for the first two, which process both matter–energy and information: reproducer and boundary.

The processors of matter–energy are: 
* ingestor, distributor, converter, producer, storage, extruder, motor, supporter

The processors of information are:
* input transducer, internal transducer, channel and net, timer (added later), decoder, associator, memory, decider, encoder, output transducer.

==Miller's living systems theory==
James Grier Miller in 1978 wrote a 1,102-page volume to present his living systems theory. He constructed a general theory of living [[system]]s by focusing on concrete systems—nonrandom accumulations of matter–energy in physical space–time organized into interacting, interrelated [[subsystem]]s or components. Slightly revising the original model a dozen years later, he distinguished eight "nested" hierarchical levels in such complex structures. Each level is "nested" in the sense that each higher level contains the next lower level in a nested fashion.

His central thesis is that the systems in existence at all eight levels are [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]] composed of twenty critical subsystems that process inputs, throughputs, and outputs of various forms of matter–energy and information. Two of these subsystems—reproducer and boundary—process both matter–energy and information. Eight of them process only matter–energy. The other ten process information only. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;All nature is a continuum. The endless complexity of life is organized into patterns which repeat themselves—theme and variations—at each level of system. These similarities and differences are proper concerns for science. From the ceaseless streaming of protoplasm to the many-vectored activities of supranational systems, there are continuous flows through living systems as they maintain their highly organized steady states.&lt;ref&gt;(Miller, 1978, p. 1025)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Seppänen (1998) says that Miller applied [[general systems theory]] on a broad scale to describe all aspects of living systems.&lt;ref&gt;Seppänen 1998, pp. 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topics in living systems theory===
Miller's theory posits that the mutual interrelationship of the components of a system extends across the hierarchical levels. Examples: Cells and organs of a living system thrive on the food the organism obtains from its suprasystem; the member countries of a supranational system reap the benefits accrued from the communal activities to which each one contributes. Miller says that his eclectic theory "ties together past discoveries from many disciplines and provides an outline into which new findings can be fitted".&lt;ref&gt;(Miller, 1978, p. 1025)&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller says the concepts of space, time, matter, energy, and information are essential to his theory because the living systems exist in space and are made of matter and energy organized by information. Miller's theory of living systems employs two sorts of spaces: physical or geographical space, and conceptual or abstracted spaces. Time is the fundamental "fourth dimension" of the physical space–time continuum/spiral. Matter is anything that has mass and occupies physical space. Mass and energy are equivalent as one can be converted into the other. Information refers to the degrees of freedom that exist in a given situation to choose among signals, symbols, messages, or patterns to be transmitted.

Other relevant concepts are system, structure, process, type, level, echelon, suprasystem, subsystem, transmissions, and steady state. A system can be conceptual, concrete or abstracted. The structure of a system is the arrangement of the subsystems and their components in three-dimensional space at any point of time. Process, which can be reversible or irreversible, refers to change over time of matter–energy or information in a system. Type defines living systems with similar characteristics. Level is the position in a hierarchy of systems. Many complex living systems, at various levels, are organized into two or more echelons. The suprasystem of any living system is the next higher system in which it is a subsystem or component. The totality of all the structures in a system which carry out a particular process is a subsystem. Transmissions are inputs and outputs in concrete systems. Because living systems are open systems, with continually altering fluxes of matter–energy and information, many of their equilibria are dynamic—situations identified as steady states or flux equilibria.

Miller identifies the comparable matter–energy and information processing critical subsystems. Elaborating on the eight hierarchical levels, he defines society, which constitutes the seventh hierarchy, as "a large, living, concrete system with [community] and lower am levels of living systems as subsystems and components".&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1978, p. 747.&lt;/ref&gt; Society may include small, primitive, totipotential communities; ancient city–states, and kingdoms; as well as modern nation–states and empires that are not supranational systems. Miller provides general descriptions of each of the subsystems that fit all eight levels.

A supranational system, in Miller's view, "is composed of two or more societies, some or all of whose processes are under the control of a decider that is superordinate to their highest echelons".&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1978, p. 903&lt;/ref&gt; However, he contends that no supranational system with all its twenty subsystems under control of its decider exists today. The absence of a supranational decider precludes the existence of a concrete supranational system. Miller says that studying a supranational system is problematical because its subsystems
&lt;blockquote&gt;...tend to consist of few components besides the decoder. These systems do little matter-energy processing. The power of component societies [nations] today is almost always greater than the power of supranational deciders. Traditionally, theory at this level has been based upon intuition and study of history rather than data collection. Some quantitative research is now being done, and construction of global-system models and simulations is currently burgeoning.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1978, p. 1043.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the supranational system level, Miller's emphasis is on international organizations, associations, and groups comprising representatives of societies (nation–states). Miller identifies the subsystems at this level to suit this emphasis. Thus, for example, the reproducer is "any multipurpose supranational system which creates a single purpose supranational organization" (p.&amp;nbsp;914); and the boundary is the "supranational forces, usually located on or near supranational borders, which defend, guard, or police them" (p.&amp;nbsp;914).

===Strengths of Miller's theory===
Not just those specialized in international communication, but all communication science scholars could pay particular attention to the major contributions of living systems theory (LST) to social systems approaches that [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Kenneth D. Bailey]], (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out:
* The specification of the twenty critical subsystems in any living system.
* The specification of the eight hierarchical levels of living systems.
* The emphasis on cross-level analysis and the production of numerous cross-level hypotheses.
* Cross-subsystem research (e.g., formulation and testing of hypotheses in two or more subsystems at a time).
* Cross-level, cross-subsystem research.

[[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]] says that LST, perhaps the "most integrative" social systems theory, has made many more contributions that may be easily overlooked, such as: providing a detailed analysis of types of systems; making a distinction between concrete and abstracted systems; discussion of physical space and time; placing emphasis on information processing; providing an analysis of entropy;  recognition of totipotential systems, and partipotential systems; providing an innovative approach to the structure–process issue; and introducing the concept of joint subsystem—a subsystem that belongs to two systems simultaneously; of dispersal—lateral, outward, upward, and downward; of inclusion—inclusion of something from the environment that is not part of the system; of artifact—an animal-made or human-made inclusion; of adjustment process, which combats stress in a system; and of critical subsystems, which carry out processes that all living systems need to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D. Bailey 2006, pp.292–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

LST's analysis of the twenty interacting subsystems, [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]] adds, clearly distinguishing between matter–energy-processing and information-processing, as well as LST's analysis of the eight interrelated system levels, enables us to understand how social systems are linked to biological systems. LST also analyzes the irregularities or "organizational pathologies" of systems functioning (e.g., system stress and strain, feedback irregularities, information–input overload). It explicates the role of entropy in social research while it equates [[negentropy]] with information and order. It emphasizes both structure and process, as well as their interrelations.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D. bailey, 1994, pp. 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
It omits the analysis of subjective phenomena, and it overemphasizes concrete Q-analysis (correlation of objects) to the virtual exclusion of R-analysis (correlation of variables). By asserting that societies (ranging from [[Totipotent#Totipotency|totipotential]] communities to nation-states and non-supranational systems) have greater control over their subsystem components than supranational systems have, it dodges the issue of transnational power over the contemporary social systems. Miller's supranational system bears no resemblance to the modern world-system that [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (1974) described, although both of them were looking at the same living (dissipative) structure.

'''Luke Campbell''', {{post-nominals|country=UK|MBE}} (born 27 September 1987) is a British [[professional boxer]]. He held the [[WBC Silver]] and [[Commonwealth Boxing Council|Commonwealth]] [[lightweight]] titles from 2016 to 2017, and has challenged once for the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] and [[The Ring (magazine)|''Ring'' magazine]] lightweight titles in 2017. As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]], Campbell won gold medals at the [[2008 European Amateur Boxing Championships|2008 European Championships]] and [[2012 Olympics]], as well as silver at the [[2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships|2011 World Championships]], all in the [[bantamweight]] division.

==Amateur boxing career==
'''Senior ABA titles'''

Campbell fought for St. Paul's Amateur Boxing Club in Hull, winning the [[Amateur Boxing Association of England|English senior ABA]] bantamweight title in 2007 and retaining in 2008 after beating Gareth Smith 23–1 in the final.&lt;ref name="Strefa"&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=English ABA Nationals | work=Strefa| url=http://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Nationalchamps/England2008.html| accessdate=16 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2008 European Championships'''

He represented England at the [[2008 European Amateur Boxing Championships]] in [[Liverpool]]. At the Championships, Campbell defeated Olympic bronze medalist [[Veaceslav Gojan]] of Moldova in the quarterfinals and Denis Makarov of Germany in the semifinals before facing the experienced [[Detelin Dalakliev]] of Bulgaria in the final.&lt;ref name="Euro results 2008"&gt;{{cite web|author= |title=Medallists by weight category |work=[[International Boxing Association (amateur)|AIBA]] |url=http://www.aiba.org/documents/site1/Events/European%20CHs%202008/2008%20Euro%20CH%20Medallists.pdf |accessdate=16 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920060228/http://www.aiba.org/documents/site1/Events/European%20CHs%202008/2008%20Euro%20CH%20Medallists.pdf |archivedate=20 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After four rounds the Bulgarian levelled the scores in the fight to 5 each after he scored a point in the last two seconds of the fight. The decision then went to countback and Campbell was awarded the title making Campbell the first Englishman to win a European amateur title since 1961.&lt;ref name="Campbell eyes"&gt;{{cite web | author=Mark Staniforth | title=CAMPBELL EYES 2012 AFTER EURO GLORY | work=[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]] | url=http://www.sportinglife.com/boxing/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=boxing/08/11/15/BOXING_European.html | accessdate=16 November 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605020851/http://www.sportinglife.com/boxing/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=boxing%2F08%2F11%2F15%2FBOXING_European.html | archivedate=5 June 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2010 Four Nations Challenge'''

Following his successful return, following a year long sabbatical to recover from tendon surgery,  to International competition at the WBC Night Of Champions in Cardiff in July, Luke started his 2012 London Olympics preparations by securing Gold at the Four Nations Challenge in Sheffield.

On the Saturday Luke, who convincingly won his Featherweight (57&amp;nbsp;kg) fight by an 11–5 points margin over China’s Jun Tan at the WBC Night Of Champions,&lt;ref name="Campbell olympic dream"&gt;{{cite web | author=Gianluca Di Caro | title=Luke Campbell’s Olympic Dream Back On Track After Huge Win In Cardiff | work=BoxingNews24 | url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2010/08/luke-campbell%E2%80%99s-olympic-dream-back-on-track-after-huge-win-in-cardiff-set-to-fight-again-this-weekend/| accessdate=28 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; continued his winning ways by beating Kazakhstan’s Shulakov Madi by 6 – 4 in the semi final of the Four Nations Challenge.

In Sunday’s final Luke again faced Jun Tan from China, his adversary the previous week at the WBC Night of Champions. As before Luke dominated the proceedings, this time winning by an increased points margin of 11–3.&lt;ref name="Campbell reigns supreme"&gt;{{cite web | author=Gianluca Di Caro | title=Luke Campbell Reigns Supreme At Four Nations Challenge | work=Boxing Republic | url=http://www.boxingrepublic.com/2010/08/08/luke-campbell-reigns-supreme-at-four-nations-challenge/| accessdate=28 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2011 World Championships'''

Campbell qualified for the [[2012 Olympic Games]] after winning a silver medal at the [[2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships – Bantamweight]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].

===2012 Summer Olympics===
[[File:Luke Campbell Gold Telephone Box 2.jpg|right|thumb|Gold telephone box near St Paul's Boxing Club, Hull commemorating Campbell's gold medal at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]
At the [[2012 London Olympics]], Campbell won gold in the 56&amp;nbsp;kg Bantamweight division after beating [[Ireland]]'s [[John Joe Nevin]] 14:11. Campbell had earlier beaten Italian, [[Vittorio Parrinello]], by 11:9. In the quarter-finals he met [[Detelin Dalakliev]] of [[Bulgaria]] in his closest bout of the competition, controversially{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} edging it by a score of 16:15. His next opponent, [[Satoshi Shimizu]] from Japan- who had earlier been reinstated in the tournament by [[International Boxing Association (amateur)|AIBA]] after a successful appeal after a defeat by [[Magomed Abdulhamidov]] was beaten by 20:11. Campbell beat Nevin in the final bout, and dropped the Irishman at the start of the third round, thus becoming the first bantamweight boxer to win Olympic gold for [[Great Britain]] since [[Henry Thomas (boxer)|Henry Thomas]] in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luke Campbell – Events and results|url=http://www.london2012.com/athlete/campbell-luke-1075758/events/|publisher=www.london2012.com|accessdate=14 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130128100321/http://www.london2012.com/athlete/campbell-luke-1075758/events/|archivedate=28 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A first class [[postage stamp]], depicting Campbell, was issued by [[Royal Mail]] and a post box in Hessle Road, Hull was painted gold to commemorate his gold medal win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Gold-medal-stamp-Olympic-champion-Luke-Campbell/story-16693505-detail/story.html|title=Gold medal stamp for Olympic champion Luke Campbell|date=11 August 2012|work=This is Hull and East Riding|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local telephone network provider, [[KCOM Group|KC]], have also commemorated the win by painting one of their telephone boxes, near to St Paul's Boxing Club, gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-19232488|title=Luke Campbell: Hull honours Olympics boxing gold medallist|date=12 August 2012|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to boxing.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=60367 |date=29 December 2012 |page=24 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/NY2013-honours-London-2012.pdf|title= 2013 New Year's Honours|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional boxing career==
===Early career===
Campbell's first professional fight took place on 13 July 2013 at [[Craven Park, Hull|Craven Park]] in his home city of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/23298740|title=Luke Campbell set to make professional boxing debut|date=13 July 2013|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His opponent was Andy Harris who he beat in the first round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/23303803|title=Luke Campbell wins first professional fight in 88 seconds|date=14 July 2013|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell continued his undefeated start to his career with a 5th round stoppage of Lee Connelly in Hull on 2 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/24791623|title=Luke Campbell continues winning start to professional career|date=2 November 2013|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his fifth professional bout Campbell carried on his undefeated record and became the first person to stop Scott Moises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/26311245|title=Curtis Woodhouse wins British title and confirms retirement|date=22 February 2014|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Campbell announced that he would be taking a break from boxing, pulling out of his next scheduled bout, following his father being diagnosed with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/boxing/27045225|title=uke Campbell: Olympic champion taking break from boxing|date=15 April 2014|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite announcing he would be taking a break from boxing, Campbell fought a further four times in 2014. A points win over Craig Woodruff, a knockout win of Steve Trumble, a TKO victory over Krzysztof Szot and another TKO win over Daniel Eduardo Brizuela. In March 2015, Campbell faced off against 24 year old Nicaraguan Levis Morales (11-1-1, 4 KOs) at the Ice Arena in Hull. Campbell knocked down Morales in round 2 and 3, before the referee Howard John Foster stopped the fight resulting in a TKO victory for Campbell.

On 1 August, Campbell claimed the vacant [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] International [[lightweight]] title by defeating fellow Hullensian [[Tommy Coyle (boxer)|Tommy Coyle]] (21-2, 10 KOs) via 10-round TKO at the [[Craven Park, Hull|KC Lightstream Stadium]]. This was also a WBC lightweight eliminator.

Campbell was floored for the first time in his professional career in a ragged defensive display as Mendy received a split decision with scores of 115-112, 115-113, while the third judge scored it 115-113 for Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/joshua-vs-whyte/news/33578/10098318/joshua-vs-whyte-luke-campbell-suffers-shock-points-defeat-to-yvan-mendy-at-the-o2|title=Campbell suffers first ever shock defeat|last=|first=|date=|website=Sky Sports|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a 3-month lay off, Campbell started a comeback trail in March on the undercard of [[Kell Brook|Brook]]-[[Kevin Bizier|Bizier]] at the [[Sheffield Arena]] in Sheffield fighting British boxer [[Gary Sykes]] (28-4, 6 KOs) for the vacant [[List of Commonwealth Boxing Council champions|Commonwealth]] lightweight title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/10171656/luke-campbell-to-face-gary-sykes-on-march-26|title=Cambell to fight Sykes in comeback fight|last=|first=|date=|website=Sky Sports|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell made a winning return to the ring in spectacular fashion only needing two rounds to finish Sykes off in his first fight since losing his unbeaten professional record. A left hook that landed hard on the top of Sykes' head had him struggling before a straight right put him down. Although Sykes beat the count, Campbell was all over him. It was the left-hook that opened the door again, this time in the midsection, followed by a right to the temple. Referee Steve Gray moved swiftly in as Sykes' corner was throwing their towel to halt the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/10219729/luke-campbell-beats-gary-sykes-in-two-rounds-on-his-return-to-the-ring|title=Campbell makes successful return stopping Sykes in 2 rounds|last=|first=|date=|website=Sky Sports|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoter Eddie Hearn revealed Campbell was next due to fight on 30 July 2016 at the [[First Direct Arena]] in [[Leeds]] for the vacant [[WBC Silver]] lightweight title against 30 year old former [[List of super-featherweight boxing champions|IBF super featherweight]] champion [[Argenis Mendez]] (23-4-1, 12 KOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/luke-campbell-will-fight-argenis-mendez/|title=Luke Campbell will fight Argenis Mendez - Boxing News|date=18 June 2016|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although being floored by a sharp right hand in the second round, Campbell proved to be too quick and dominated the remainder of the fight to claim the vacant [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Silver [[lightweight]] title. From the third round, it became a comfortable fight for Campbell who moved his opponent around the ring and caught him with a succession of punches. The scorecards were all in favour of Campbell 116-111, 117-110, 115-112, who stated he would now like to land a world title shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/10517979/luke-campbell-climbs-off-canvas-to-beat-argenis-mendez-on-leeds-undercard|title=Campbell wins despite being knocked down|last=|first=|date=30 July 2016|website=Sky Sports|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathews was dropped following a couple of left hooks to his body. In the post fight interview, Campbell claimed, despite winning via stoppage, his game plan was 'to outbox Mathews for a points win'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/10619544/bellew-vs-flores-luke-campbell-stops-derry-mathews-to-retain-wbc-silver-lightweight-title|title=Luke Campbell stops Derry Mathews to retain WBC Silver lightweight title|last=|first=|date=16 October 2016|website=Sky Sports|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Campbell vs. Pérez====
On 10 April 2017, [[Eurosport]] and [[Sky Sports]] announced that Campbell would be involved in a [[List of WBA world champions|WBA Lightweight]] title eliminator against former interim WBA ightweight titlist [[Darleys Pérez]] (33-2-2, 21 KOs) on the [[Anthony Joshua vs. Wladimir Klitschko]] undercard at the [[Wembley Stadium]] on 29 April 2017.

Campbell racked up the win via a 9th round stoppage win, which was due to injury. It was said that Pérez hurt his left arm after a throwing a left hook. He signaled to the referee that he could not continue and the fight was stopped at 1 minute 28 seconds into the round. Although Pérez started the fight well, enough to win the first three rounds, he physically looked gassed by the later rounds where Campbell took over. With the win, Campbell was made the new mandatory challenger to WBA champion, held by Jorge Linares. [[Eddie Hearn]] said he would speak to Golden Boy Promotions to push things forward for the fight to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/19273758/scott-quigg-defeats-viorel-simion-wins-chance-go-featherweight-title|title=Quigg defeats Simion, wins chance at featherweight title|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/luke-campbell-stops-darleys-perez-ninth-wba-eliminator--116115|title=Luke Campbell Stops Darleys Perez in Ninth of WBA Eliminator - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell believed he won the fight, speaking to Max Kellerman he said, “No one can ever doubt my heart. Yeah, I got off to a rocky start. He hit me with a nice, clean shot in the second round, caught me on the eye, cut it. I wasn’t dazed.  From there, I had double vision in one eye for the rest of the fight. But from then, I out-classed him. I thought I won the fight. He’s a great champion, but I thought I out-classed him. I didn't think he was landing any shots whatsoever, and I was catching him with all the clean shots.” Linares praised Campbell for his efforts, “He was a tough opponent. Many people said he was very easy, but it’s not for no reason he’s an Olympic champion. I fought very well all the way to the 12th round. And I think in the fifth round, I started to box him a little bit because I didn't wanna get hurt.” CompuBox stats showed Linares landed 140 of 414 thrown (34%) , while Campbell was credited to landing 141 of his 524 thrown (27%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/20798123/jorge-linares-defeats-luke-campbell-split-decision-retains-lightweight-title|title=Linares edges Campbell to keep lightweight title|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fight, promoter Eddie Hearn stated that Campbell could fight the winner of [[Anthony Crolla|Crolla]] vs. [[Ricky Burns|Burns]] or another possible opponent would be WBO champion [[Terry Flanagan (boxer)|Terry Flanagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/sport/luke-campbells-next-fight-options-523401|title=Luke Campbell's next fight options revealed as he speaks out after narrow loss|last=Young|first=Chris|date=24 September 2017|work=Hull Daily Mail|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day after the fight, Campell revealed that his father, 58, had lost his battle with cancer and had died two weeks before the fight.

'''[[Machine learning]]''', a subfield of [[computer science]] involving the development of algorithms that learn how to make predictions based on data, has a number of emerging applications in the field of [[bioinformatics]]. Bioinformatics deals with computational and mathematical approaches for understanding and processing biological data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Prior to the emergence of machine learning algorithms, bioinformatics algorithms had to be explicitly programmed by hand which, for problems such as [[protein structure prediction]], proves extremely difficult.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Yuedong|last2=Gao|first2=Jianzhao|last3=Wang|first3=Jihua|last4=Heffernan|first4=Rhys|last5=Hanson|first5=Jack|last6=Paliwal|first6=Kuldip|last7=Zhou|first7=Yaoqi|title=Sixty-five years of the long march in protein secondary structure prediction: the final stretch?|url=https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/doi/10.1093/bib/bbw129/2769436/Sixty-five-years-of-the-long-march-in-protein|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=482–494|doi=10.1093/bib/bbw129|pmid=28040746|pmc=5952956|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machine learning techniques such as [[deep learning]] enable the algorithm to make use of automatic [[feature learning]] which means that based on the dataset alone, the algorithm can learn how to combine multiple [[Feature (machine learning)|features]] of the input data into a more abstract set of features from which to conduct further learning. This multi-layered approach to learning patterns in the input data allows such systems to make quite complex predictions when trained on large datasets. In recent years, the size and number of available biological datasets have skyrocketed, enabling bioinformatics researchers to make use of these machine learning systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Machine learning has been applied to six main subfields of bioinformatics: [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[microarrays]], [[systems biology]], [[evolution]], and [[text mining]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larrañaga|first=Pedro|last2=Calvo|first2=Borja|last3=Santana|first3=Roberto|last4=Bielza|first4=Concha|last5=Galdiano|first5=Josu|last6=Inza|first6=Iñaki|last7=Lozano|first7=José A.|last8=Armañanzas|first8=Rubén|last9=Santafé|first9=Guzmán|title=Machine learning in bioinformatics|url=https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/doi/10.1093/bib/bbk007/264025/Machine-learning-in-bioinformatics|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|volume=7|issue=1|pages=86–112|doi=10.1093/bib/bbk007|pmid=16761367|date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Genomics ===
[[File:Growth of GenBank.png|thumb|The exponential growth of GenBank, a genomic sequence database provided by the National center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)]]
[[Genomics]] involves the study of the [[genome]], the complete DNA sequence, of organisms. While genomic sequence data has historically been sparse due to the technical difficulty in sequencing a piece of DNA, the number of available sequences is growing exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/statistics/|title=GenBank and WGS Statistics|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while raw data is becoming increasingly available and accessible, the biological interpretation of this data is occurring at a much slower pace.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathé|first=Catherine|last2=Sagot|first2=Marie-France|last3=Schiex|first3=Thomas|last4=Rouzé|first4=Pierre|date=October 1, 2002|title=Current methods of gene prediction, their strengths and weaknesses|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=30|issue=19|pages=4103–4117|issn=1362-4962|pmc=140543|pmid=12364589|doi=10.1093/nar/gkf543}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there is an increasing need for the development of machine learning systems that can automatically determine the location of protein-encoding genes within a given DNA sequence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is a problem in computational biology known as [[gene prediction]].

Gene prediction is commonly performed through a combination of what are known as extrinsic and intrinsic searches.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For the extrinsic search, the input DNA sequence is run through a large database of sequences whose genes have been previously discovered and their locations annotated. A number of the sequence's genes can be identified by determining which strings of bases within the sequence are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to known gene sequences. However, given the limitation in size of the database of known and annotated gene sequences, not all the genes in a given input sequence can be identified through homology alone. Therefore, an intrinsic search is needed where a gene prediction program attempts to identify the remaining genes from the DNA sequence alone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Machine learning has also been used for the problem of [[multiple sequence alignment]] which involves aligning many DNA or amino acid sequences in order to determine regions of similarity that could indicate a shared evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
It can also be used to detect and visualize genome rearrangements.&lt;ref name="rearrang"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratas|first=D|author2=Silva, R|author3= Pinho, A|author4= Ferreira, P|title=An alignment-free method to find and visualise rearrangements between pairs of DNA sequences.|journal=Scientific Reports (Group Nature)|date=May 18, 2015|volume=5|number=10203|pmid=25984837|doi=10.1038/srep10203|pages=10203|pmc=4434998|bibcode=2015NatSR...510203P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proteomics ===
[[File:C16orf95 protein secondary structure prediction.png|thumb|A protein's amino acid sequence annotated with the protein secondary structure. Each amino acid is labeled as either an alpha helix, a beta sheet, or a coil.]]
[[Protein]]s, strings of [[amino acid]]s, gain much of their function from [[protein folding]] in which they conform into a three-dimensional structure. This structure is composed of a number of layers of folding, including the [[Protein primary structure|primary structure]] (i.e. the flat string of amino acids), the [[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] ([[Alpha helix|alpha helices]] and [[beta sheet]]s), the [[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]], and the [[Protein quaternary structure|quartenary structure]].

Protein secondary structure prediction is a main focus of this subfield as the further protein foldings (tertiary and quartenary structures) are determined based on the secondary structure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Solving the true structure of a protein is an incredibly expensive and time-intensive process, furthering the need for systems that can accurately predict the structure of a protein by analyzing the amino acid sequence directly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Prior to machine learning, researchers needed to conduct this prediction manually. This trend began in 1951 when Pauling and Corey released their work on predicting the hydrogen bond configurations of a protein from a polypeptide chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pauling|first=L.|last2=Corey|first2=R. B.|last3=Branson|first3=H. R.|date=April 1, 1951|title=The structure of proteins; two hydrogen-bonded helical configurations of the polypeptide chain|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=37|issue=4|pages=205–211|issn=0027-8424|pmc=1063337|pmid=14816373|doi=10.1073/pnas.37.4.205|bibcode=1951PNAS...37..205P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, through the use of automatic feature learning, the best machine learning techniques are able to achieve an accuracy of 82-84%.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The current state-of-the-art in secondary structure prediction uses a system called DeepCNF (deep convolutional neural fields) which relies on the machine learning model of [[artificial neural network]]s to achieve an accuracy of approximately 84% when tasked to classify the amino acids of a protein sequence into one of three structural classes (helix, sheet, or coil).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Sheng|last2=Peng|first2=Jian|last3=Ma|first3=Jianzhu|last4=Xu|first4=Jinbo|date=December 1, 2015|title=Protein secondary structure prediction using deep convolutional neural fields|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=18962|arxiv=1512.00843|bibcode=2016NatSR...618962W|doi=10.1038/srep18962|pmid=26752681|pmc=4707437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical limit for three-state protein secondary structure is 88–90%.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Machine learning has also been applied to proteomics problems such as [[Side chain|protein side-chain]] prediction, [[Turn (biochemistry)|protein loop]] modeling, and [[protein contact map]] prediction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Microarrays ===
Microarrays, a type of [[lab-on-a-chip]], are used for automatically collecting data about large amounts of biological material. Machine learning can aid in the analysis of this data, and it has been applied to expression pattern identification, classification, and genetic network induction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:DNA-microarray analysis.jpg|thumb|A DNA-microarray analysis of Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is shown and identifies differences in gene expression patterns.]]
This technology is especially useful for monitoring the expression of genes within a genome, aiding in diagnosing different types of cancer based on which genes are expressed.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pirooznia|first=Mehdi|last2=Yang|first2=Jack Y.|last3=Yang|first3=Mary Qu|last4=Deng|first4=Youping|date=2008|title=A comparative study of different machine learning methods on microarray gene expression data|journal=BMC Genomics|volume=9|issue=1|pages=S13|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-9-S1-S13|issn=1471-2164|pmc=2386055|pmid=18366602}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main problems in this field is identifying which genes are expressed based on the collected data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, due to the huge number of genes on which data is collected by the microarray, there is a large amount of irrelevant data to the task of expressed gene identification, further complicating this problem. Machine learning presents a potential solution to this problem as various classification methods can be used to perform this identification. The most commonly used methods are [[radial basis function network]]s, [[deep learning]], [[Naive Bayes classifier|Bayesian classification]], [[decision tree]]s, and [[random forest]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Systems biology ===
Systems biology focuses on the study of the emergent behaviors from complex interactions of simple biological components in a system. Such components can include molecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/researchtopic/2362/machine-learning-in-molecular-systems-biology|title=Machine Learning in Molecular Systems Biology|website=Frontiers|language=en|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine learning has been used to aid in the modelling of these complex interactions in biological systems in domains such as genetic networks, signal transduction networks, and metabolic pathways.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Graphical model|Probabilistic graphical models]], a machine learning technique for determining the structure between different variables, are one of the most commonly used methods for modeling genetic networks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, machine learning has been applied to systems biology problems such as identifying [[DNA binding site|transcription factor binding sites]] using a technique known as [[Markov chain|Markov chain optimization]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Genetic algorithm]]s, machine learning techniques which are based on the natural process of evolution, have been used to model genetic networks and regulatory structures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other systems biology applications of machine learning include the task of enzyme function prediction, high throughput microarray data analysis, analysis of genome-wide association studies to better understand markers of Multiple Sclerosis, protein function prediction, and identification of NCR-sensitivity of genes in yeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=d'Alché-Buc|first=Florence|last2=Wehenkel|first2=Louis|date=2008|title=Machine Learning in Systems Biology|journal=BMC Proceedings|volume=2|issue=4|pages=S1|doi=10.1186/1753-6561-2-S4-S1|issn=1753-6561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Text mining ===
The increase in available biological publications led to the issue of the increase in difficulty in searching through and compiling all the relevant available information on a given topic across all sources. This task is known as [[knowledge extraction]]. This is necessary for biological data collection which can then in turn be fed into machine learning algorithms to generate new biological knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krallinger|first=Martin|last2=Erhardt|first2=Ramon Alonso-Allende|last3=Valencia|first3=Alfonso|date=March 15, 2005|title=Text-mining approaches in molecular biology and biomedicine|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644605033763|journal=Drug Discovery Today|volume=10|issue=6|pages=439–445|doi=10.1016/S1359-6446(05)03376-3|pmid=15808823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machine learning can be used for this knowledge extraction task using techniques such as [[natural language processing]] to extract the useful information from human-generated reports in a database. [[Text Nailing]], an alternative approach to machine learning, capable of extracting features from clinical narrative notes was introduced in 2017.

This technique has been applied to the search for novel drug targets, as this task requires the examination of information stored in biological databases and journals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Annotations of proteins in protein databases often do not reflect the complete known set of knowledge of each protein, so additional information must be extracted from biomedical literature. Machine learning has been applied to automatic annotation of the function of genes and proteins, determination of the [[Protein targeting|subcellular localization of a protein]], analysis of [[Gene expression|DNA-expression arrays]], large-scale [[List of protein interactions|protein interaction]] analysis, and molecule interaction analysis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Another application of text mining is the detection and visualization of distinct DNA regions given sufficient reference data.&lt;ref name="sing"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratas|first=D|author2=Hosseini, M|author3=Silva, R|author4= Pinho, A|author5= Ferreira, P|title=Visualization of Distinct DNA Regions of the Modern Human Relatively to a Neanderthal Genome|journal=Iberian Conference on Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis.

[[File:Mariano IV Arborea.png|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Marianus IV of Arborea, [[San Nicola (Ottana)|church of San Nicola]] ([[Ottana]])]]
'''Marianus IV''' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: Marià IV d'Arborea, 1329&lt;ref&gt;Or perhaps 1317.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 1376), called '''the Great''', was the [[Giudice of Arborea]], island of [[Sardinia]], from 1347 to his death. He was, as his nickname indicates, the greatest sovereign of [[Giudicato of Arborea|Arborea]]. He was a legislator and a warrior whose reign saw the commencement of massive codification of the laws of his realm and incessant warfare with the [[Aragonese Empire]]. He was also a religious man, who had connections to [[Catherine of Siena]]. He was, in short, an "wise legislator, able politician, and valiant warrior."&lt;ref&gt;Nowé, 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life in Catalonia==
Born at [[Oristano]], he was the son of [[Hugh II of Arborea|Hugh II]] and successor of his brother [[Peter III of Arborea|Peter III]]. At the behest of his father he spent most of his youth in [[Barcelona]], where he was educated at the court of [[Alfonso IV of Aragon]]. He participated actively in the coronation of [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter IV]] in 1336. In 1336 in Barcelona, he married [[Timbor de Rocabertí|Timbor]], daughter of [[Dalmatius IV of Rocabertí]] and Beatrice of Serrallonga, Baroness of [[Cabrenys]]. In 1339, he was invested by Peter with the counties of [[Besalú|Bas]] (Spain), [[Goceano]] (Sardinia), and [[Marmilla]] (Sardinia).

In 1347, the [[Doria (family)|Doria]] rebelled and defeated the Catalans at [[Aidu de Turdu]], occupying [[Bonorva]]. This sparked a long war between Aragon and Genoa, but at the outset the Doria could not take advantage of their victory. On 11 September 1349, he returned to Oristano, two years after succeeding his childless elder brother. One of his first acts was to repopulate the town of Goceano, rebuild the castle there, and plant a florid garden.

==War with Aragon==
{{Main|Sardinian-Catalan War}}
Though an alliance had been in effect with Aragon for more than fifty years at the time of his accession, Marianus realised that the political aim of Peter IV was nothing less than the annexation of Sardinia and, following the conquest of [[Alghero]] (1353), he parted ways with the Catalans. He allied with the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and the Doria, then at war with Aragon, and made himself an enemy of the Aragonese.

Marianus' first directive was against Gherardo [[della Gherardescha]], a loyal Pisan vassal of the Aragonese. He attacked [[Castel di Castro]] from the south but was rebuffed. He initiated a siege until his Doria allies could attack from the north. They did, and took Alghero. His armies proved successful in the field and he succeeded in expelling the Aragonese from every redoubt on the island save the stronghold of Castel di Castro. He even menaced [[Sassari]] in 1354. Later that year, Peter IV landed on the island at [[Nulauro]]. Marianus promptly began a guerilla war of ambushes against royal troops until, at the end of 1355, a brief peace was signed at [[Sanluri]] by which Marianus renounced Alghero. The peace lasted two years, during which Marianus reinforced his armies and the country progressed favourably economically.

In 1365, the war resumed with full force. [[Pope Urban V]] confirmed Arborean possession of the whole of the island save Sassari, Alghero, and [[Cagliari]]. Peter IV, however, sent a fleet commanded by [[Pere de Luna]] to lead an Aragonese army deep into Arborea, bypassing other fortifications to assault Oristano. The Aragonese troops were trapped between the Arborean armies commanded by Marianus and his son, the future [[Hugh III of Arborea|Hugh III]], and  defeated. In 1368, Marianus finally occupied Sassari. He was preparing another campaign when he died in 1376.

==Legislation==
During the two-year peace, Marianus began the work of putting down in writing the oral laws and customs of Arborea. The chief legislative work of his lifetime was the ''[[Codice Rurale]]'', which his daughter [[Eleanor of Arborea|Eleanor]] later incorporated into her massive ''[[Carta de Logu]]''. His great work, however, was cut short by his sudden death of the [[bubonic plague]] in 1376.

==Children==
By his wife Tambor, Marianus left three children:
*[[Hugh III of Arborea|Hugh III]], his successor
*[[Eleanor of Arborea|Eleanor]], his son's successor
*Beatrice (died 1377), married (1363) to [[Aimeric VI of Narbonne]]
*an unnamed daughter died young on 14 January 1343
Timbor was still living in 1361, but that is the last she is heard of.

The '''Methuselah-like proteins''' are a family of [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s found in insects that play a role in aging and reproduction. [[Receptor antagonist|Antagonizing]] these receptors can extend the life span of the animal and make it more resistant to free radicals and starvation, but also reduce reproduction and increase cold sensitivity. The age dependent decline in olfaction and motor function is unaffected.&lt;ref name="pmid17764591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alic N, Partridge L | title = Antagonizing Methuselah to extend life span | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 222 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17764591 | pmc = 2374980 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2007-8-8-222 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methuselah-like proteins are related to G protein-coupled receptors of the [[secretin receptor]] family.&lt;ref name="pmid11274391" /&gt;

==Education and career==

Hossain passed SSC and HSC exam from [[Ideal School and College]] and [[Dhaka College]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://mohammadsamirhossain.com&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his medical graduation from [[Sir Salimullah Medical College]] in Dhaka. After that, he studied Basic modern psychology, Abnormal psychology, Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Philosophy (Death) for which he participated in different external educational activities offered from different institutions including some prestigious ones like [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], [[Harvard Medical School]], and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name="S Hossain 2011"&gt;M S Hossain, 2011, Abstinence: A Memoir. Journal of Loss and Trauma. Vol-16, Issue-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;About Dr Samir(M S Hossain)at www.mohammadsamirhossain.org&lt;/ref&gt; After his education in Psychotherapy, he was engaged in [[Death anxiety (psychology)]] researches.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of International Biography, 33rd Edition, International Biographical Center. Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Hossain is a physician. He taught Psychiatry at the [[Medical College for Women and Hospital]] at Uttara in Dhaka.&lt;ref&gt;List of Faculties at MCW&amp;H. Retrieved from http://www.medicalcollegeforwomen.edu.bd/Faculty.php&lt;/ref&gt; He is an honorary external faculty of the Palliative Care Service at [[Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University]] where he teaches death related psychiatry.&lt;ref name="S Hossain 2011"/&gt;

Hossain's educations in different modes of distance learning, after his medical graduation, created some sort of traumatic turmoil during his early career inside his own country. However, as per Hossain's autobiography, his researches and their conclusions helped him in healing that wound that ultimately gave birth to further development in his works.&lt;ref&gt;M S Hossain, 2011, I passed the next examination: the exam of life, in, Abstinence: A Memoir. Journal of Loss and Trauma. Vol-16, Issue-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

Of all the works of Hossain, [[Death and adjustment hypotheses]] is the most noteworthy one in the field of death anxiety research. Apart from his books written on it, in UK, the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] at London published the theory as the article ''Facing the finality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses''.&lt;ref&gt;http://rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Later, once again it reached the international community of scientists through the [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] publication ''Journal of Loss and Trauma'' as the article ''Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses''.&lt;ref&gt;Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses. Mohammad Samir Hossain. Journal of Loss and Trauma. Vol. 15, Iss. 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; With the declaration of the hypotheses, two things were postulated. The first part of the hypotheses theorises that death should not be considered the end of existence. The next segment states the belief that the immortal pattern of human existence can only be adopted in a morally rich life with the attitude towards morality and materialism balanced mutually.&lt;ref name=MeyersGoldenPeterson/&gt;
&lt;ref name=SladeGlogster/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.escp.org/death_anxiety.html; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," Psychoanalytic Psychology, vol. 21, no.1, 31–53; Langs, R. (2004) Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==

Two most practised theory books in English language authored by Hossain are ''Quest for a New Death'' and ''Human Immortality''&lt;ref name=GilbertAdjustment2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;

==Personal life==

Hossain’s personal life is contributory to his scientific activities in such a way that the ''Journal of Loss and Trauma'' published his partial autobiography ''Abstinence: A Memoir'' in 2011 to reflect how psychological traumas taught and helped him learning to cope.&lt;ref name="Hossain, MS 2011"&gt;Hossain, MS,2011,Abstinence: A Memoir, Journal of Loss and Trauma, 16:5&lt;/ref&gt; In that article, Hossain, mentioned of his elder son Mohammad Seeyam Samir's death as the strongest motivation for his researches on death anxiety. He also mentioned of his anticipatory fear about his parents – Md Manjur Hossain and Rezia Begum's death in unknown future as another motivational factor from his early childhood; both of them eventually died before 2015. It ultimately compelled him to learn and theorise how to adjust to the phenomenon of death of the loved ones. Hossain is married to Tahmina Rahman Chowdhury. They have another son, Mohammad Raiyan Samir.&lt;ref name="Hossain, MS 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;About Dr Samir (M S Hossain), Retrieved from http://www.mohammadsamirhossain.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/believe-question-part-1-mohammad-samir-hossain?published=u&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training career==
East moved to [[San Diego]], [[California]] in 1996 and later moved to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], where he works as a fight trainer in the Johnny Tocco gym. In 2011, he worked with [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[light welterweight]] titleholder [[Zab Judah]] and [[World Boxing Council|WBC]]/[[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[bantamweight]] champion [[Nonito Donaire]].&lt;ref name="philstar.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/thedeanscorner/articlescontent.aspx?articleId=686228&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=69{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; East also worked with [[Eddie Mustafa Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="fighthype.com"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Born of a Filipina and black American U.S. Navy sailor, East didn't meet his father until he became champion. He traveled from the Philippines to the United States a month after winning his WBA belt to locate his father, John East, Sr. With the help of a [[CNN]] news team, the father was located in [[Oakland]], [[California]] and their first meeting was broadcast by CNN. Morris, Jr. improved his father's living condition but his father, suffering from bad health, died of a massive heart attack a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/Morris_East&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, more than 13&amp;nbsp;million births each year face serious complications, and every day about 800 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth (about 300,000 annually).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Yang|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/09/28/car_mechanic_to_the_rescue_invents_device_to_help_women_give_birth.html |title=Car mechanic to the rescue: Invents device to help women give birth |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date= September 28, 2013|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of forceps and other mechanical devices in the extraction of a baby in a difficult delivery can cause internal bleeding in the mother or may result in injuries to the baby's head or spine.

The Odón Device has the potential to allow for [[vaginal delivery]] in complicated pregnancies in which common medical practice would have led to a [[cesarean section]], the use of [[forceps in childbirth|forceps to extract the newborn]] or the use of a [[ventouse]] vacuum device that attaches suction cups directly to the baby's scalp.&lt;ref name=NYT2013/&gt; By reducing contact between the baby's skull and the birth canal, the risk of infection is also reduced.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;

==Conception==
The device was developed by Jorge Odón, a car mechanic from [[Lanús]], [[Argentina]] who had seen a video describing a method to extract a loose cork from inside an empty wine bottle by inserting a plastic bag into the bottle, inflating the bag once it has enveloped the cork and then pulling out the inflated bag together with the cork. Odón conceived of the use of this same technique that evening in bed and spoke with an obstetrician who encouraged him to move ahead with the idea. The first model of the device was created by sewing a sleeve onto a cloth bag and was tested using a doll inserted into a glass jar to simulate the use of the device in the delivery process.&lt;ref name=NYT2013/&gt;

In complicated deliveries, the device is positioned against the baby's scalp and the lubricated sleeve is gently inserted around the baby's head. Once a marker on the device indicates that it has been positioned properly, the inner compartment of the sleeve is inflated, providing a strong grip on the baby's head. The inserter is taken away and the sleeve can be pulled with up to {{convert|19|kg}} of force to pull out the head and allow for delivery of the baby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odondevice.org/device.php Device], Odón Device. Accessed November 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing and development==
After further testing, Odón was introduced to the chief of obstetrics at a hospital in [[Buenos Aires]] who saw the benefit of the method and arranged to have the device tested more thoroughly at an Iowa laboratory that has simulators designed to model delivery methods more realistically. Safety testing had been performed on 20 women in Argentina, all of whom had previously given birth and were experiencing uncomplicated pregnancies, including a woman who was able to deliver a baby weighing {{convert|9|lb}} with only two pushes. Further testing will be conducted on more than 250 women in [[China]], [[India]] and [[South Africa]], with a mix of pregnant women experiencing normal and complicated labor.&lt;ref name=NYT2013/&gt;

[[Becton Dickinson]] has agreed to manufacture and distribute the unit, and estimates that the Odón Device could be constructed for $50 per unit, and it is expected that it could be used by [[midwives]] as well as [[obstetrician]]s who would need minimal training to use the device effectively.&lt;ref name=NYT2013/&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) offered favorable notices regarding the device, which was recognized for its "potential to save the lives of mothers and newborns at the time of birth".&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;[http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/maternal_perinatal/odon_device/en/ New, low-cost instrument for assisted vaginal delivery], [[World Health Organization]]. Accessed November 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO's Dr. Mario Merialdi called the device "exciting", saying that childbirth is an area that has had little recent progress.&lt;ref name=NYT2013/&gt; Dr. [[Margaret Chan]], Director-General of the WHO, described the device as "a low-cost simplified way to deliver babies, and protect mothers [that] promises to transfer life-saving capacity to rural health posts, which almost never have the facilities and staff to perform a C-section [as] the first simple new tool for assisted delivery since forceps and vacuum extractors were introduced centuries ago."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odondevice.org/excerpts-of-the-who-dg-speech.php "The WHO Director-General highlights World Health Organization work in her speech to the 65 World Health Assembly"], Odón Device.

[[File:Hubbert Upper-Bound Peak 1956.png|thumb|Hubbert's upper-bound prediction for US crude oil production (1956), and actual [[Lower 48|lower-48]] states production through 2014]]

&lt;!-- P1 -Introductory paragraph on Peak oil. --&gt;'''Peak oil''' is the theorized point in time when the maximum rate of [[extraction of petroleum]] is reached, after which it is expected to enter terminal decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirsch|first1=Robert L.|title=PEAKING OF WORLD OIL PRODUCTION: IMPACTS, MITIGATION, &amp; RISK MANAGEMENT|journal=US Department of Energy|date=2005|pages=1–91|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/others/pdf/Oil_Peaking_NETL.pdf|accessdate=14 January 2016|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peak oil theory is based on the observed rise, peak, fall, and depletion of [[aggregate data|aggregate]] production rate in [[oil field]]s over time. It is often confused with [[oil depletion]]; however, whereas ''depletion'' refers to a period of falling reserves and supply, ''peak oil'' refers to peak, before terminal depletion occurs. The concept of peak oil is often credited to geologist [[M. King Hubbert]] whose [[Hubbert peak theory|1956 paper]] first presented a formal theory.

&lt;!-- P2 -economic effects --&gt;Some observers, such as petroleum industry experts [[Kenneth S. Deffeyes]] and [[Matthew Simmons]], predicted there would be negative [[world economy|global economy]] effects after a post-peak production decline and subsequent [[price of oil|oil price]] increase because of the continued dependence of most modern industrial [[transport]], [[agriculture|agricultural]], and [[industry|industrial]] systems on the low cost and high availability of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deffeyes|first1=Kenneth S.|title=Beyond Oil: The View from Hubbert's Peak|date=2005|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simmons|first1=Matthew R.|title=Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=Hoboken}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictions vary greatly as to what exactly these negative effects would be. While the notion that petroleum production must peak at some point is not controversial, the assertion that this must coincide with a serious economic decline, or even that the decline in production will necessarily be caused by an exhaustion of available reserves, is not universally accepted.

&lt;!-- P3 -Timing of peak oil --&gt;Oil production forecasts on which predictions of peak oil are based are sometimes made within a range which includes optimistic (higher production) and pessimistic (lower production) scenarios. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], conventional crude oil production peaked in 2006.&lt;ref name=IEA2010/&gt; A 2013 study concluded that peak oil "appears probable before 2030", and that there was a "significant risk" that it would occur before 2020,&lt;ref name=miller2013 /&gt; and assumed that major investments in [[alternative fuel|alternatives]] will occur before a crisis, without requiring major changes in the lifestyle of heavily oil-consuming nations. Pessimistic predictions of future oil production made after 2007 state either that the peak has already occurred,&lt;ref name=deffeyes012007&gt;

&lt;!-- P4 -Peak oil global prediction --&gt;Hubbert's original prediction that US peak oil would occur in about 1970 appeared accurate for a time, as US average annual production peaked in 1970 at 9.6 million barrels per day and mostly declined for more than 3 decades after.&lt;ref name=EIAt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcrfpus1&amp;f=a |title=US Field Production of Crude Oil |publisher=Energy Information Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of [[hydraulic fracturing]] caused US production to rebound during the 2000s, challenging the inevitability of post-peak decline for the US oil production.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=Ron|title=US Oil Production Nears Previous Peak|url=http://peakoilbarrel.com/no-name-yet/|website=Peak Oil Barrel|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Hubbert's original predictions for world peak oil production proved premature.&lt;ref name=miller2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=R.

==Modeling global oil production==
{{Main|Hubbert peak theory}}
The idea that the rate of oil production would peak and irreversibly decline is an old one. In 1919, David White, chief geologist of the [[United States Geological Survey]], wrote of US petroleum: "...&amp;nbsp;the peak of production will soon be passed, possibly within 3 years."&lt;ref&gt;David White, "The unmined supply of petroleum in the United States," ''Transactions of the Society of Automotive Engineers'', 1919, v.14, part 1, p.227.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Eugene Ayers, a researcher for [[Gulf Oil]], projected that if US ultimate recoverable oil reserves were 100 billion barrels, then production in the US would peak no later than 1960. If ultimate recoverable were to be as high as 200 billion barrels, which he warned was wishful thinking, US peak production would come no later than 1970. Likewise for the world, he projected a peak somewhere between 1985 (one trillion barrels ultimate recoverable) and 2000 (two trillion barrels recoverable). Ayers made his projections without a mathematical model. He wrote: "But if the curve is made to look reasonable, it is quite possible to adapt mathematical expressions to it and to determine, in this way, the peak dates corresponding to various ultimate recoverable reserve numbers"&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Ayers,"U.S. oil outlook: how coal fits in," ''Coal Age'', August 1953, v58 n.8 p&amp;nbsp;70–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

By observing past discoveries and production levels, and predicting future discovery trends, the geoscientist M. King Hubbert used statistical modelling in 1956 to predict that United States oil production would peak between 1965 and 1971.&lt;ref name=mkinghubbert1956&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |title=Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels 'Drilling and Production Practice' |last= Hubbert | first = Marion King |authorlink=M.

Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-09086-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however during 2018 daily production of oil in the United States was exceeding daily production in 1970, the year that was previously the peak. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US oil production tops 10 million barrels a day for first time since 1970|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/31/us-oil-production-tops-10-million-barrels-a-day-for-first-time-since-1970.html|website=CNBC|accessdate=24 July 2018|date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Record For US Oil Production   |url= http://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/new-record-us-oil-production?nopaging=1|website=ETF.com|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbert used a semi-[[logistic distribution|logistical]] curved model (sometimes incorrectly compared to a [[normal distribution]]). He assumed the production rate of a limited resource would follow a roughly symmetrical distribution. Depending on the limits of exploitability and market pressures, the rise or decline of resource production over time might be sharper or more stable, appear more linear or curved.&lt;ref name=Brandt2007/&gt; That model and its variants are now called [[Hubbert peak theory]]; they have been used to describe and predict the peak and decline of production from regions, countries, and multinational areas.&lt;ref name=Brandt2007&gt;{{cite journal | last= Brandt | first = Adam R. | title = Testing Hubbert | journal = Energy Policy | volume = 35 | issue = 5 |date=May 2007 | pages = 3074–3088 | format = PDF | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2006.11.004 | url = http://www.iaee.org/en/students/best_papers/Adam_Brandt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same theory has also been applied to other limited-resource production.

More recently, the term "peak oil" was popularized by [[Colin Campbell (geologist)|Colin Campbell]] and Kjell Aleklett in 2002 when they helped form the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas (ASPO).&lt;ref name=wakeford2012&gt;{{cite web|last=Wakeford|first=Jeremy|title=Peak oil is no myth|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/peak-oil-is-no-myth-2012-07-27|work=Engineering News|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his publications, Hubbert used the term "peak production rate" and "peak in the rate of discoveries".&lt;ref name=mkinghubbert1956&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |title=Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels 'Drilling and Production Practice' |last= Hubbert | first = Marion King |authorlink=M.

In a 2006 analysis of Hubbert theory, it was noted that uncertainty in real world oil production amounts and confusion in definitions increases the uncertainty in general of production predictions. By comparing the fit of various other models, it was found that Hubbert's methods yielded the closest fit over all, but that none of the models were very accurate.&lt;ref name=Brandt2007/&gt; In 1956 Hubbert himself recommended using "a family of possible production curves" when predicting a production peak and decline curve.&lt;ref name=mkinghubbert1956&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |title=Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels 'Drilling and Production Practice' |last= Hubbert | first = Marion King |authorlink=M.

A comprehensive 2009 study of oil depletion by the UK Energy Research Centre noted:&lt;ref&gt;Roger Bentley et al., “Comparison of global oil supply forecasts,” UK Energy Research Centre, Review of Evidence for Global Oil Depletion, Technical Rept. 7, July 2009, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | Few analysts now adhere to a symmetrical bell-shaped production curve. This is correct, as there is no natural physical reason why the production of a resource should follow such a curve and little empirical evidence that it does. | Bentley et al. | Comparison of global oil supply forecasts}}

The report noted that Hubbert had used the logistic curve because it was mathematically convenient, not because he firmly believed it to be correct. The study observed that in most cases, the asymmetric exponential model provided a better fit, and that peaks tended to occur well before half the oil had been produced, with the result that in nearly all cases, the post-peak decline was more gradual than the increase leading up to the peak.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Brandt, “Methods of forecasting future oil supply,” UK Energy Research Centre, Review of Evidence for Global Oil Depletion, Technical Rept. 6, July 2009, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demand==
[[File:Global oil consumption 1980-2013.png|thumbnail|Global consumption of oil 1980–2013 (Energy Information Administration)]]

The [[supply and demand|demand]] side of peak oil over time is concerned with the total quantity of oil that the global market would choose to consume at various possible market prices and how this entire listing of quantities at various prices would evolve over time. Global demand for crude oil grew an average of 1.76% per year from 1994 to 2006, with a high growth of 3.4% in 2003–2004. After reaching a high of {{convert|85.6|Moilbbl|m3}} per day in 2007, world consumption decreased in both 2008 and 2009 by a total of 1.8%, despite fuel costs plummeting in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;BP, Statistical Review of World Energy 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this lull, world's demanded for oil is projected to increase 21% over 2007 levels by 2030 ({{convert|104|Moilbbl/d}} from {{convert|86|Moilbbl}}), or about 0.8% average annual growth, largely due to increases in demand from the transportation sector.&lt;ref name=bbc062006&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5099400.stm |title=World oil demand 'to rise by 37%' |publisher=BBC News |date=20 June 2006 |accessdate=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eia2007ieo&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/archive/ieo07/pdf/oil.pdf |title=2007 International Energy Outlook, Ch.3.

Although demand growth is highest in the [[developing world]],&lt;ref name=eiaoilconsumption&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/international/oilconsumption.html |title=International Petroleum (Oil) Consumption Data |publisher=[[Energy Information Administration|United States Energy Information Administration]] |accessdate=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States is the world's largest consumer of petroleum. Between 1995 and 2005, US consumption grew from {{convert|17700000|oilbbl/d}} to {{convert|20700000|oilbbl/d}}, a {{convert|3000000|oilbbl/d}} increase. China, by comparison, increased consumption from {{convert|3400000|oilbbl/d}} to {{convert|7000000|oilbbl/d}}, an increase of {{convert|3600000|oilbbl/d}}, in the same time frame.&lt;ref name=BP2008&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/downloads/pdf/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_review_2008.pdf |format=PDF |title=BP Statistical Review of Energy |publisher=[[BP]] |date=June 2008 |accessdate=27 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) stated that gasoline usage in the United States may have peaked in 2007, in part because of increasing interest in and mandates for use of biofuels and energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;

As countries [[Economic development|develop]], industry and higher [[living standards]] drive up energy use, oil usage being a major component. Thriving economies, such as [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[India]], are quickly becoming large oil consumers.&lt;ref name=bbc070508&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7387203.stm |title=Oil price 'may hit $200 a barrel' |publisher=BBC News |date=7 May 2008 |accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, China surpassed the United States as the world's largest crude oil importer in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McSpadden|first1=Kevin|title=China Has Become the World's Biggest Crude Oil Importer for the First Time|url=http://time.com/3853451/china-crude-oil-top-importer/|website=TIME|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil consumption growth is expected to continue; however, not at previous rates, as China's economic growth is predicted to decrease from the high rates of the early part of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Bob|title=IMF Warns of Slower China Growth Unless Beijing Speeds Up Reforms|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-annual-report-warns-of-slower-china-growth-unless-beijing-speeds-up-economic-reforms-1406768402|website=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=News Corp|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's oil imports are expected to more than triple from 2005 levels by 2020, rising to 5 million barrels per day (790×103 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/d).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=Jason|title=China And India: A Rage For Oil|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2005-09-04/china-and-india-a-rage-for-oil|website=Business Week|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population===
[[File:World population history.svg|thumb|World population]]

Another significant factor affecting petroleum demand has been human [[population growth]]. The [[United States Census Bureau]] predicts that [[world population]] in 2030 will be almost double that of 1980.&lt;ref name=censusworldpop&gt;
{{cite journal |url=https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/worldpoptotal.php &lt;!-- html version dead as of 07/2009: https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/worldpop.html --&gt; |title=Total Midyear Population for the World: 1950–2050 |publisher= [[United States Census Bureau]] |date=18 June 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil production per capita peaked in 1979 at 5.5 barrels/year but then declined to fluctuate around 4.5 barrels/year since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nelder|first1=Chris|title=The 21st century population crash|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-21st-century-population-crash/|website=ZDNet|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, the decreasing population growth rate since the 1970s has somewhat ameliorated the per capita decline.&lt;ref name=censusworldpop/&gt;

===Economic growth===
Some analysts argue that the cost of oil has a profound effect on economic growth due to its pivotal role in the extraction of resources and the processing, manufacturing, and transportation of goods.&lt;ref name="How Economic Growth Fails"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tverberg|first1=Gail|title=How Economic Growth Fails|url=http://ourfiniteworld.com/2015/08/10/how-economic-growth-fails/|website=Our Finite World|accessdate=10 January 2016|date=2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the industrial effort to extract new unconventional oil sources increases, this has a compounding negative effect on all sectors of the economy, leading to economic stagnation or even eventual contraction. Such a scenario would result in an inability for  national economies to pay high oil prices, leading to declining demand and a price collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tverberg|first1=Gail|title=What's Ahead?

==Supply==
[[File:Global liquids and US tight oil.png|thumb|Global liquids production 2000-2015, indicating the component of US tight oil (Energy Information Administration)]]

{{quote|Our analysis suggests there are ample physical oil and liquid fuel resources for the foreseeable future. However, the rate at which new supplies can be developed and the break-even prices for those new supplies are changing. |[[International Energy Agency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.iea.org/about/faqs/oil/ |title=FAQs Oil |publisher=[[International Energy Agency|IEA]] |accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Defining sources of oil===
Oil may come from conventional or unconventional sources. The terms are not strictly defined, and vary within the literature as definitions based on new technologies tend to change over time.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Sorrell and others, ''Global Oil Depletion'', UK Energy Research Centre, {{ISBN|1-903144-03-5}}, p.xiii, 9, 124.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, different oil forecasting studies have included different classes of liquid fuels. Some use the terms "conventional" oil for what is included in the model, and "unconventional" oil for classes excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Colin J. Campbell and Jean H. Laherrere, [http://dieoff.org/page140.htm The end of cheap oil], Scientific American, March 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;78–83&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Hubbert confined his peak oil prediction to that crude oil "producible by methods now in use."&lt;ref name=mkinghubbert1956/&gt; By 1962, however, his analyses included future improvements in exploration and production.&lt;ref name="M. King Hubbert 1962 p.73-75"&gt;M. King Hubbert, ''Energy Resources''(Washington: National Academy of Sciences, 1962)Publication 1000-D, p.&amp;nbsp;73–75.&lt;/ref&gt; All of Hubbert's analyses of peak oil specifically excluded oil manufactured from oil shale or mined from oil sands. A 2013 study predicting an early peak excluded deepwater oil, tight oil, oil with API gravity less than 17.5, and oil close to the poles, such as that on the North Slope of Alaska, all of which it defined as non-conventional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hallock|first=John L.|author2=Wu, Wei |author3=Hall, Charles A.S. |author4= Jefferson, Michael |title=Forecasting the limits to the availability and diversity of global conventional oil supply: Validation|journal=Energy|date=January 2014|volume=64|pages=130–153|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2013.10.075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commonly used definitions for conventional and unconventional oil are detailed below.

===Conventional sources===

Conventional oil is extracted on land and offshore using standard techniques,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.capp.ca/canadaIndustry/oil/Pages/default.aspx
|title=conventional oil definition from Canadian Association of Oil Producers
|work= Crude Oil
|year=2014
|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be categorized as light, medium, heavy, or extra heavy in grade. The exact definitions of these grades vary depending on the region from which the oil came.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.petroleum.co.uk/api
|title= API Gravity
|work= An introduction to Petroleum
|year=2015
|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Light oil flows naturally to the surface or can be extracted by simply pumping it out of the ground. Heavy refers to oil that has higher density and therefore lower [[API gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Disciplines/Heavy-Oil.aspx|website=Schlumberger|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not flow easily, and its consistency is similar to that of molasses. While some of it can be produced using conventional techniques, recovery rates are better using unconventional methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.petroleum.co.uk/heavy-crude-oil
|title= Heavy Crude Oil
|work= An introduction to Petroleum
|year=2015
|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Energy Agency]], conventional crude oil production peaked in 2006, with al all-time maximum of 70 millions of [[oil barrels|barrels]] per day.&lt;ref name=IEA2010&gt;[[International Energy Agency]], [https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/weo2010.pdf World Energy Outlook 2010], pages 48 and 125 ({{ISBN|9789264086241}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unconventional sources===
Oil currently considered unconventional is derived from multiple sources.
* [[Tight oil]] is extracted from deposits of low-permeability rock, sometimes shale deposits but often other rock types, using [[hydraulic fracturing]], or "fracking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/t/tight_oil.aspx|website=Schlumberger|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often confused with shale oil, which is oil manufactured from the kerogen contained in an oil shale (see below), Production of tight oil has led to a resurgence of US production in recent years. U.S. tight oil production peaked in March 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mushalik|first1=Matt|title=US shale oil peak in 2015|url=http://crudeoilpeak.info/us-shale-oil-peak-in-2015|website=Crude Oil Peak|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fell a total of 12 percent over the next 18 months. But then U.S. tight oil production rose again, and by September 2017 had exceeded the old peak, and as of October 2017, U.S. tight oil production was still rising.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/data.php#crude Estimates of tight oil production], accessed 9 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Lower 48 production 2012-17.png|thumb|US Lower 48 oil production from 2012 and anticipated decline in production to the end of 2017, with rig count (Energy Information Administration)]]

* [[Oil shale]] is a common term for sedimentary rock such as [[shale]] or [[marl]], containing [[kerogen]], a waxy oil precursor that has not yet been transformed into crude oil by the high pressures and temperatures caused by deep burial. The term "oil shale" is somewhat confusing, because what is referred to in the U.S. as "oil shale" is not really oil and the rock it is found in is generally not shale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Oil Shale |work= An introduction to Petroleum |url= http://www.petroleum.co.uk/oil-shale |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is close to the surface rather than buried deep in the earth, the shale or marl is typically mined, crushed, and [[retort]]ed, producing synthetic oil from the kerogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/s/shale_oil.aspx|website=Schlumberger|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its [[Energy returned on energy invested|net energy yield]] is much lower than conventional oil, so much so that estimates of the net energy yield of shale discoveries are considered extremely unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGlade|first1=Christophe|last2=Speirs|first2=Jamie|last3=Sorrell|first3=Steve|title=Methods of estimating shale gas resources – Comparison, evaluation and implications|journal=Energy|date=September 2013|volume=59|pages=116–125|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2013.05.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Richter |last=Philipp |title=From Boom to Bust?

* [[Oil sands]] are unconsolidated [[sandstone]] deposits containing large amounts of very viscous crude [[bitumen]] or extra-[[heavy crude oil]] that can be recovered by [[surface mining]] or by [[in-situ]] oil wells using [[Steam injection (oil industry)|steam injection]] or other techniques. It can be liquefied by [[upgrader|upgrading]], blending with [[diluent]], or by heating; and then processed by a conventional [[oil refinery]]. The recovery process requires advanced [[technology]] but is more efficient than that of oil shale. The reason is that, unlike U.S. "oil shale", Canadian oil sands actually contain oil, and the sandstones they are found in are much easier to produce oil from than shale or marl. In the [[American English|U.S. dialect of English]], these formations are often called "tar sands", but the material found in them is not tar but an extra-heavy and viscous form of oil technically known as [[bitumen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Bitumen and Oil Sands |work= An introduction to Petroleum |url= http://www.petroleum.co.uk/bituemn |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuela has [[oil sands]] deposits similar in size to those of Canada, and approximately equal to the world's reserves of conventional oil.  Venezuela's [[Orinoco Belt]] tar sands are less viscous than Canada's [[Athabasca oil sands]] – meaning they can be produced by more conventional means – but they are buried too deep to be extracted by [[surface mining]]. Estimates of the recoverable reserves of the Orinoco Belt range from {{convert|100|Goilbbl|e9m3}} to {{convert|270|Goilbbl|e9m3}}. In 2009, USGS updated this value to {{convert|513|Goilbbl|m3}}.&lt;ref name="USGS Venezuela"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2009/3028/pdf/FS09-3028.pdf|title=An Estimate of Recoverable Heavy Oil Resources of the Orinoco Oil Belt, Venezuela|author1=Christopher J.

[[File:US Crude Oil Production and Imports.svg|thumb|United States crude oil production exceeds imports for the first time since the early 1990s]]
* [[Coal liquefaction]] or [[gas to liquids]] product are liquid hydrocarbons that are [[Synthetic fuel|synthesised]] from the conversion of coal or natural gas by the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]], [[Bergius process]], or [[Karrick process]]. Currently, two companies [[SASOL]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], have synthetic oil technology proven to work on a commercial scale. Sasol's primary business is based on CTL (coal-to-liquid) and GTL (natural gas-to-liquid) technology, producing US$4.40 billion in revenues (FY2009). Shell has used these processes to recycle waste [[Gas flare|flare gas]] (usually burnt off at oil wells and refineries) into usable synthetic oil. However, for CTL there may be insufficient coal reserves to supply global needs for both liquid fuels and electric power generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hook &amp; Aleklett |title=A review on coal-to-liquid fuels and its coal consumption|journal=[[International Journal of Energy Research]]|date=30 July 2009|volume=34|issue=10|pages=848–864|doi=10.1002/er.1596|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-114247}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Minor sources include [[thermal depolymerization]], as discussed in a 2003 article in [[Discover (magazine)|''Discover'' magazine]], that could be used to manufacture oil indefinitely, out of garbage, sewage, and agricultural waste. The article claimed that the cost of the process was $15 per barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://discovermagazine.com/2003/may/featoil/ | date=1 May 2003 | author=Lemley Brad | title=Anything Into Oil | journal=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover magazine]] | accessdate =11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up article in 2006 stated that the cost was actually $80 per barrel, because the feedstock that had previously been considered as hazardous waste now had market value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://discovermagazine.com/2006/apr/anything-oil/ | date=2 April 2006 | author=Lemley Brad | title=Anything Into Oil | journal=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover magazine]] | accessdate =11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 news bulletin published by [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] proposed that [[hydrogen economy|hydrogen]] (possibly produced using hot fluid from nuclear reactors to [[electrolysis|split water]] into hydrogen and oxygen) in combination with [[Carbon capture and storage#Sequestration|sequestered {{co2}}]] could be used to produce [[methanol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH), which could then be converted into gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambrosiano|first1=Nancy|title=Synthetic fuel concept to steal CO2 from air|url=http://www.lanl.gov/discover/news-release-archive/2008/February/02.12.synthetic-fuel.php|website=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Revisions to US Oil Reserves 2011.png|left|thumb|Although US proved oil reserves grew by 3.8 billion barrels in 2011, even after deducting 2.07 billion barrels of production, only 8 percent of the 5.84 billion barrels of the newly booked oil was because of new field discoveries ([[Energy Information Administration|U.S. EIA]])]]

But despite the fall-off in new field discoveries, and record-high production rates, the reported proved reserves of crude oil remaining in the ground in 2014, which totaled 1,490 billion barrels, not counting Canadian heavy oil sands, were more than quadruple the 1965 proved reserves of 354 billion barrels.&lt;ref&gt;OPEC, [http://www.opec.org/library/Annual%20Statistical%20Bulletin/interactive/current/FileZ/Main.htm Annual Statistical/ Annual Statistical Bulletin 2014].&lt;/ref&gt; A researcher for the [[Energy Information Administration|U.S. Energy Information Administration]] has pointed out that after the first wave of discoveries in an area, most oil and natural gas reserve growth comes not from discoveries of new fields, but from extensions and additional gas found within existing fields.&lt;ref&gt;David F. Morehouse, [ftp://eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/feature_articles/1997/intricate_puzzle_oil_gas_reserves_growth/pdf/m07fa.pdf The intricate puzzle of oil and gas reserve growth], US Energy Information Administration, Natural Gas Monthly, July 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the UK Energy Research Centre noted that "discovery" is often used ambiguously, and explained the seeming contradiction between falling discovery rates since the 1960s and increasing reserves by the phenomenon of reserve growth. The report noted that increased reserves within a field may be discovered or developed by new technology years or decades after the original discovery. But because of the practice of "backdating," any new reserves within a field, even those to be discovered decades after the field discovery, are attributed to the year of initial field discovery, creating an illusion that discovery is not keeping pace with production.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Sorrell and others, ''Global Oil Depletion'', UK Energy Research Centre, {{ISBN|1-903144-03-5}}, p.&amp;nbsp;24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oil Reserves.png|thumb|350px|right|Proven [[oil reserves]], 2013]]

Total possible conventional crude [[oil reserves]] include crude oil with 90% certainty of being technically able to be produced from reservoirs (through a wellbore using primary, secondary, improved, enhanced, or tertiary methods); all crude with a 50% probability of being produced in the future (probable); and discovered reserves that have a 10% possibility of being produced in the future (possible). Reserve estimates based on these are referred to as 1P, proven (at least 90% probability); 2P, proven and probable (at least 50% probability); and 3P, proven, probable and possible (at least 10% probability), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Etherington et al.|first1=John|title=Comparison of Selected   Reserves and Resource Classifications and Associated Definitions|url=http://www.spe.org/industry/docs/OGR_Mapping.pdf|website=Society of Petroleum Engineers|accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not include liquids extracted from mined solids or gasses ([[oil sand]]s, [[oil shale]], [[gas to liquids|gas-to-liquid processes]], or [[coal liquefaction|coal-to-liquid processes]]).&lt;ref name=iht072007&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.blnz.com/news/2007/07/16/Study_Demand_outpace_crude_supply_pply.html |title=Oil industry report says demand to outpace crude oil production |author=Herbert, Jozef|publisher= BLNZ|agency=Associated Press|date=16 July 2007|accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbert's 1956 peak projection for the United States depended on geological estimates of ultimate recoverable oil resources, but starting in his 1962 publication, he concluded that ultimate oil recovery was an output of his mathematical analysis, rather than an assumption. He regarded his peak oil calculation as independent of reserve estimates.&lt;ref&gt;M. King Hubbert, 1962, "Energy Resources," National Academy of Sciences, Publication 1000-D, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. King Hubbert, "National Academy of Sciences Report on Energy Resources: reply," AAPG Bulletin, Oct. 1965, v.49 n.10 p.1720-1727.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. King Hubbert, "Degree of advancement of petroleum exploration in United States," AAPG Bulletin, Nov. 1967, v.51 n.11 p.2207-2227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many current 2P calculations predict reserves to be between 1150 and 1350 Gb, but some authors have written that because of misinformation, withheld information, and misleading reserve calculations, 2P reserves are likely nearer to 850–900 Gb.&lt;ref name=ewg1007/&gt;&lt;ref name=owen032010/&gt; The Energy Watch Group wrote that actual reserves peaked in 1980, when production first surpassed new discoveries, that apparent increases in reserves since then are illusory, and concluded (in 2007): "Probably the world oil production has peaked already, but we cannot be sure yet."&lt;ref name=ewg1007/&gt; &lt;!-- this paragraph refers to total reserves (3P), not just proved (1P), which means technically and economically producible&amp;nbsp;... that 1P reserves grow is not surprising --&gt;

====Concerns over stated reserves====

[[Sadad Ibrahim Al Husseini|Sadad Al Husseini]] estimated that {{convert|300|Goilbbl}} of the world's {{convert|1200|Goilbbl}} of proven reserves should be recategorized as speculative resources.&lt;ref name=cohen102007/&gt;

[[File:OPEC declared reserves 1980-now EIA.svg|thumb|400px|Graph of OPEC reported reserves showing jumps in stated reserves without associated discoveries, as well as the lack of depletion despite yearly production]]

One difficulty in forecasting the date of peak oil is the opacity surrounding the oil reserves classified as "proven". In many major producing countries, the majority of reserves claims have not been subject to outside audit or examination.&lt;ref name=bostonglobe122005&gt;

For the most part, proven reserves are stated by the oil companies, the producer states and the consumer states. All three have reasons to overstate their proven reserves: oil companies may look to increase their potential worth; producer countries gain a stronger [[international relations|international stature]]; and governments of consumer countries may seek a means to foster sentiments of [[security]] and [[inflation|stability]] within their [[economy|economies]] and among consumers.

Major discrepancies arise from accuracy issues with the self-reported numbers from the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC). Besides the possibility that these nations have overstated their reserves for political reasons (during periods of no substantial discoveries), over 70 nations also follow a practice of not reducing their reserves to account for yearly production. Analysts have suggested that OPEC member nations have economic incentives to exaggerate their reserves, as the OPEC quota system allows greater output for countries with greater reserves.&lt;ref name=nyt08212005&gt;

[[Kuwait]], for example, was reported in the January 2006 issue of ''Petroleum Intelligence Weekly'' to have only {{convert|48|Goilbbl}} in reserve, of which only 24 were fully proven.

The EUR reported by the 2000 USGS survey of {{convert|2300|Goilbbl}} has been criticized for assuming a discovery trend over the next twenty years that would reverse the observed trend of the past 40 years. Their 95% confidence EUR of {{convert|2300|Goilbbl}} assumed that discovery levels would stay steady, despite the fact that new-field discovery rates have declined since the 1960s. That trend of falling discoveries has continued in the ten years since the USGS made their assumption. The 2000 USGS is also criticized for other assumptions, as well as assuming 2030 production rates inconsistent with projected reserves.&lt;ref name=ewg1007/&gt;

Some adherents of 'peak oil' believe that production capacity will remain the main limitation of supply, and that when production decreases, it will be the main [[bottleneck (logistics)|bottleneck]] to the petroleum [[supply and demand|supply/demand]] equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Murray J. |last1=King D.|title=Climate policy: Oil's tipping point has passed.|journal=Nature|date=2012|volume=481|issue=7382|pages=433–435|doi= 10.1038/481433a|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v481/n7382/full/481433a.html|accessdate=23 September 2015|pmid=22281577}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe that the increasing industrial effort to extract oil will have a negative effect on global economic growth, leading to demand contraction and a price collapse,&lt;ref name="How Economic Growth Fails"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tverberg|first1=Gail|title=What's Ahead?

Yet others believe that the peak may be to some extent led by declining demand as new technologies and improving efficiency shift energy usage away from oil.

Worldwide oil discoveries have been less than annual production since 1980.&lt;ref name=ewg1007/&gt; World population has grown faster than oil production. Because of this, oil production ''[[per capita]]'' peaked in 1979 (preceded by a plateau during the period of 1973–1979).&lt;ref name="RCDuncan2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Duncan | first = Richard C |date=November 2001 | title = The Peak of World Oil Production and the Road to the Olduvai Gorge | journal = [[Population and Environment]] | issn = 1573-7810 | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 503–522 | doi = 10.1023/A:1010793021451 | url = http://dieoff.org/page224.htm |accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing investment in harder-to-reach oil as of 2005 was said to signal oil companies' belief in the end of easy oil.&lt;ref name=bostonglobe122005/&gt; While it is widely believed that increased oil prices spur an increase in production, an increasing number of oil industry insiders were reportedly coming to believe in 2009 that even with higher prices, oil production was unlikely to increase significantly. Among the reasons cited were both geological factors as well as "above ground" factors that are likely to see oil production plateau.&lt;ref name=reuters010908&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSL0725705620080109?sp=true |title=Tough to pump more oil, even at $100 |author1=Mackey, Peg |author2=Lawler, Alex |agency=Reuters |date=9 January 2008 |accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 ''Journal of Energy Security'' analysis of the energy return on drilling effort ([[energy returned on energy invested]], also referred to as EROEI) in the United States concluded that there was extremely limited potential to increase production of both gas and (especially) oil. By looking at the historical response of production to variation in drilling effort, the analysis showed very little increase of production attributable to increased drilling. This was because of diminishing returns with increasing drilling effort: as drilling effort increased, the energy obtained per active [[drill rig]] was reduced according to a severely diminishing [[power law]]. The study concluded that even an enormous increase of drilling effort was unlikely to significantly increase oil and gas production in a mature petroleum region such as the United States.&lt;ref name="TDKailing2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kailing | first = Timothy D | date = 14 December 2008 | title = Can the United States Drill Its Way to Energy Security? | journal = Journal of Energy Security | url = http://www.ensec.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=166:can-us-drill-its-way-to-energy-security&amp;catid=90:energysecuritydecember08&amp;Itemid=334/ |accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, contrary to the study's conclusion, since the analysis was published in 2008, US production of crude oil has increased 86%, and production of dry natural gas has increased 34% (2015 compared to 2008).&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcrfpus1&amp;f=a US crude oil production], accessed 16 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption of inevitable declining volumes of oil and gas produced per unit of effort is contrary to recent experience in the US. In the United States, as of 2017, there has been an ongoing decade-long increase in the productivity of oil and gas drilling in all the major tight oil and gas plays. The US Energy Information Administration reports, for instance, that in the Bakken Shale production area of North Dakota, the volume of oil produced per day of drilling rig time in January 2017 was 4 times the oil volume per day of drilling five years previous, in January 2012, and nearly 10 times the oil volume per day of ten years previous, in January 2007. In the Marcellus gas region of the northeast, The volume of gas produced per day of drilling time in January 2017 was 3 times the gas volume per day of drilling five years previous, in January 2012, and 28 times the gas volume per day of drilling ten years previous, in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration,  [https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/drilling/ Drilling productivity report], 15 May 2017, (see “Report data” spreadsheet).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 analysis of IEA predictions questioned several underlying assumptions and claimed that a 2030 production level of {{convert|75000000|oilbbl/d}} (comprising {{convert|55000000|oilbbl}} of crude oil and {{convert|20000000|oilbbl}} of both non-conventional oil and [[natural gas liquids]]) was more realistic than the IEA numbers.&lt;ref name=alklett112009/&gt; More recently, the EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2015 indicated no production peak out to 2040. However, this required a future Brent crude oil price of $US144/bbl (2013 dollars) "as growing demand leads to the development of more costly resources".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Energy Outlook 2015|url=https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/presentations/sieminski_05042015.pdf|website=EIA|publisher=Energy Information Administration|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the world economy can grow and maintain demand for such a high oil price remains to be seen.

====Oil field decline====
[[File:Alaska Crude Oil Production.PNG|thumb|Alaska's oil production has declined 70% since peaking in 1988]]

In a 2013 study of 733 giant oil fields, only 32% of the ultimately recoverable oil, condensate and gas remained.&lt;ref name="peakoilbarrel.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=Ron|title=JODI Data and Giant Field Depletion|url=http://peakoilbarrel.com/jodi-data-and-giant-field-depletion/|website=Peak Oil Barrel|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghawar]], which is the largest oil field in the world and responsible for approximately half of Saudi Arabia's oil production over the last 50&amp;nbsp;years, was in decline before 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=Ron|title=A Closer Look at Saudi Arabia|url=http://peakoilbarrel.com/closer-look-saudi-arabia/|website=Peak Oil Barrel|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's second largest oil field, the [[Burgan Field]] in Kuwait, entered decline in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://energybulletin.net/node/10878 |title=Kuwait oil field, world's second largest, 'Exhausted' |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=9 November 2005 |author1=Cordahi, James |author2=Critchlow, Andy |accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico announced that production from its giant [[Cantarell Field]] began to decline in March 2006, reportedly at a rate of 13% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid=aGLn091nIGio |title=Mexico's Largest Oil Field Output Falls to 4-Year Low |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=1 August 2006 |author=Arai, Adriana |accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2006, [[Saudi Aramco]] Senior Vice President Abdullah Saif estimated that its existing fields were declining at a rate of 5% to 12% per year.&lt;ref name=eiaSAbrief&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/saudi.html |title=Country Analysis Briefs: Saudi Arabia |publisher=[[Energy Information Administration|United States Energy Information Administration]] |date=August 2008 |accessdate=4 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412143230/http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/saudi.html |archivedate=12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study of the largest 811 oilfields conducted in early 2008 by [[Cambridge Energy Research Associates]], the average rate of field decline is 4.5% per year. The Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas agreed with their decline rates, but considered the rate of new fields coming online overly optimistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.peakoil.net/Aleklett/Review_CERA_report_20060808.doc |title= Review: CERA's report is over-optimistic |publisher=Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas |year=2006 |author= Aleklett, Kjell |format=DOC |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] stated in November 2008 that an analysis of 800 oilfields showed the decline in oil production to be 6.7% a year for fields past their peak, and that this would grow to 8.6% in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Energy Outlook 2008|url=http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2008-1994/weo2008.pdf|website=International Energy Agency|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more rapid annual rate of decline of 5.1% in 800 of the world's largest oil fields weighted for production over their whole lives was reported by the [[International Energy Agency]] in their [[World Energy Outlook|World Energy Outlook 2008]].&lt;ref name="iea-weo08"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/WEO2008SUM.pdf |format=PDF |title=World Energy Outlook 2008 Executive Summary |publisher=[[International Energy Agency]] |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate=24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2013 study of 733 giant fields mentioned previously had an average decline rate 3.83% which was described as "conservative."&lt;ref name="peakoilbarrel.com"/&gt;

===Control over supply===
Entities such as governments or cartels can reduce supply to the world market by limiting access to the supply through nationalizing oil, cutting back on production, limiting drilling rights, imposing taxes, etc. International sanctions, corruption, and military conflicts can also reduce supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bartos|first1=John|title=Assessing oil markets during oil supply disruptions|url=http://www.iea.org/media/training/presentations/Day_2_Session_3c_Emergency_Response_Market_Assessment.pdf|website=International Energy Agency|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nationalization of oil supplies====
{{Main|Nationalization of oil supplies}}
Another factor affecting global oil supply is the [[nationalization]] of oil reserves by producing nations. The nationalization of oil occurs as countries begin to [[Deprivatization|deprivatize]] oil production and withhold exports. Kate Dourian, Platts' Middle East editor, points out that while estimates of oil reserves may vary, politics have now entered the equation of oil supply. "Some countries are becoming off limits. Major oil companies operating in Venezuela find themselves in a difficult position because of the growing nationalization of that resource. These countries are now reluctant to share their reserves."&lt;ref name=arabianbusiness&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=495829 |title=Non-OPEC peak oil threat receding|work=[[Arabian Business]]|date=6 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to consulting firm [[PFC Energy]], only 7% of the world's estimated oil and gas reserves are in countries that allow companies like ExxonMobil free rein. Fully 65% are in the hands of state-owned companies such as Saudi Aramco, with the rest in countries such as Russia and Venezuela, where access by Western European and North American companies is difficult. The PFC study implies political factors are limiting capacity increases in [[Mexico]], Venezuela, [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], and Russia. Saudi Arabia is also limiting capacity expansion, but because of a self-imposed cap, unlike the other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/dd44e336-fe6a-11db-bdc7-000b5df10621.html|title=Politics of oil seen as threat to supplies|work=[[Financial Times]]|author=McNulty Sheila|date=9 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of not having access to countries amenable to oil exploration, ExxonMobil is not making nearly the investment in finding new oil that it did in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;

====OPEC influence on supply====
{{further|Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries}}
[[File:OPEC Surplus Crude Capacity.png|thumb|OPEC surplus crude oil production capacity, 2002–2012 (US EIA)]]

OPEC is an alliance among 14 diverse oil-producing countries (as of May 2017: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela) to manage the supply of oil. OPEC's power was consolidated in the 1960s and 1970s as various countries nationalized their oil holdings, and wrested decision-making away from the "[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]]" (Anglo-Iranian, Socony, Royal Dutch Shell, Gulf, Esso, Texaco, Socal), and created their own oil companies to control the oil. OPEC often tries to influence prices by restricting production. It does this by allocating each member country a quota for production. Members agree to keep prices high by producing at lower levels than they otherwise would. There is no way to enforce adherence to the quota, so each member has an individual incentive to "cheat" the cartel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cis.org.au/media-information/opinion-pieces/article/302-the-myth-of-opec|title=The myth of OPEC|author=Gaurav Sodhi |publisher=Australian Financial Review|date=24 June 2008|accessdate=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commodities trader Raymond Learsy, author of ''Over a Barrel: Breaking the Middle East Oil Cartel'', contends that OPEC has trained consumers to believe that oil is a much more finite resource than it is. To back his argument, he points to past false alarms and apparent collaboration.&lt;ref name=nationalreview122003 /&gt; He also believes that peak oil analysts have conspired with OPEC and the oil companies to create a "fabricated drama of peak oil" to drive up oil prices and [[profit (accounting)|profits]]; oil had risen to a little over $30/barrel at that time. A counter-argument was given in the Huffington Post after he and Steve Andrews, co-founder of ASPO, debated on CNBC in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=15568 |title=Rejecting the Real 'Snake Oil'|work=Huffington Post |date=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible consequences==
{{Further|Hirsch Report|Malthusian catastrophe}}
The wide use of fossil fuels has been one of the most important stimuli of [[economic growth]] and prosperity since the [[industrial revolution]], allowing humans to participate in takedown, or the consumption of energy at a greater rate than it is being replaced. Some believe that when oil production decreases, human culture and modern technological society will be forced to change drastically. The impact of peak oil will depend heavily on the rate of decline and the development and adoption of [[Mitigation of peak oil|effective alternatives]].

In 2005, the [[United States Department of Energy]] published a report titled ''Peaking of World Oil Production: Impacts, Mitigation, &amp; Risk Management''.&lt;ref name="hirsch_report"&gt;{{cite web

Viable mitigation options exist on both the supply and demand sides, but to have substantial impact, they must be initiated more than a decade in advance of peaking."

====Historical oil prices====
[[File:Oil Prices Since 1861.svg|thumb|400px|Long-term oil prices, 1861–2015 (top line adjusted for inflation)]]

The oil price historically was comparatively low until the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the [[1979 energy crisis]] when it increased more than tenfold during that six-year timeframe. Even though the oil price dropped significantly in the following years, it has never come back to the previous levels. Oil price began to increase again during the 2000s until it hit historical heights of $143 per barrel (2007 inflation adjusted dollars) on 30 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7048600.stm | title=What is driving oil prices so high?

====Effects of historical oil price rises====

In the past, sudden increases in the price of oil have led to economic [[recession]]s, such as the [[1973 energy crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979 energy crises]]. The effect the increased price of oil has on an economy is known as a [[price shock]]. In many European countries, which have [[gasoline usage and pricing|high taxes on fuels]], such price shocks could potentially be mitigated somewhat by temporarily or permanently suspending the taxes as fuel costs rise.&lt;ref name=kanter112007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/09/business/fuel.php |title=European politicians wrestle with high gasoline prices |author=James Kanter |work=International Herald Tribune |date=9 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of softening price shocks is less useful in countries with much lower gas taxes, such as the United States. A baseline scenario for a recent [[IMF]] paper found oil production growing at 0.8% (as opposed to a historical average of 1.8%) would result in a small reduction in economic growth of 0.2–0.4%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/10/27/imf-study-peak-oil-could-do-serious-damage-to-the-global-economy/ IMF study: Peak oil could do serious damage to the global economy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the [[Stanford Energy Modeling Forum]] found that the economy can adjust to steady, gradual increases in the price of crude better than wild lurches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/rick-santorum-thinks-gas-prices-caused-the-recession-is-he-right/2012/02/28/gIQA3JEyfR_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Rick Santorum thinks gas prices caused the recession.

Some economists predict that a [[substitution effect]] will spur demand for [[alternative fuel|alternate energy sources]], such as [[coal]] or [[liquefied natural gas]]. This substitution can be only temporary, as coal and natural gas are finite resources as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brandt|first1=A.R.|title=Peak oil demand: The role of fuel efficiency and alternative fuels in a global oil production decline.|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date=2013|volume=47|issue=14|pages=8031–8041|doi=10.1021/es401419t|pmid=23697883|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the run-up in fuel prices, many motorists opted for larger, less fuel-efficient [[sport utility vehicles]] and full-sized pickups in the United States, Canada, and other countries. This trend has been reversing because of sustained high prices of fuel. The September 2005 sales data for all vehicle vendors indicated SUV sales dropped while small cars sales increased.

The [[Export Land Model]] states that after peak oil petroleum exporting countries will be forced to reduce their exports more quickly than their production decreases because of internal demand growth. Countries that rely on imported petroleum will therefore be affected earlier and more dramatically than exporting countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoildrum.com/tag/export_land_model Export Land Model discussion archive]. TheOilDrum.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico is already in this situation. Internal consumption grew by 5.9% in 2006 in the five biggest exporting countries, and their exports declined by over 3%.

Canadian economist Jeff Rubin has stated that high oil prices are likely to result in increased consumption in developed countries through partial manufacturing de-globalisation of trade. Manufacturing production would move closer to the end consumer to minimise transportation network costs, and therefore a demand decoupling from gross domestic product would occur. Higher oil prices would lead to increased freighting costs and consequently, the manufacturing industry would move back to the developed countries since freight costs would outweigh the current economic wage advantage of developing countries.&lt;ref name=manufacturing-relocalisation&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhsMr49AKM8 |title=Jeff Rubin on Oil and the End of Globalization |author=Allan Gregg |publisher=YouTube |date=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic research carried out by the [[International Monetary Fund]] puts overall [[price elasticity of demand]] for oil at −0.025 short-term and −0.093 long term.&lt;ref name=imf-demand-elasticities&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoildrum.com/files/Screen%20shot%202011-04-26%20at%208.31.07%20AM.png |title=Oil Demand Price And Income Elasticities |author=International Monetary Fund |publisher=The Oil Drum |date=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest consumer of fossil fuels in modern agriculture is [[ammonia production]] (for [[Mineral fertilizer|fertilizer]]) via the [[Haber process]], which is essential to high-yielding [[intensive agriculture]]. The specific fossil fuel input to fertilizer production is primarily [[natural gas]], to provide [[hydrogen]] via [[steam reforming]]. Given sufficient supplies of [[renewable energy|renewable electricity]], hydrogen can be generated without fossil fuels using methods such as [[Electrolysis of water#Applications|electrolysis]]. For example, the [[Vemork]] hydroelectric plant in Norway used its surplus electricity output to generate [[Ammonia production#Sustainable ammonia production|renewable ammonia]] from 1911 to 1971.&lt;ref name="bradley_2004"&gt;

===Long-term effects on lifestyle===
[[File:EIA global transport energy by fuel 2012.png|thumbnail|World transport energy use by fuel type 2012]]
{{see also|Peak car}}

A majority of Americans live in [[suburbs]], a type of low-density settlement designed around universal personal [[automobile]] use. Commentators such as [[James Howard Kunstler]] argue that because over 90% of transportation in the U.S. relies on oil, the suburbs' reliance on the automobile is an unsustainable living arrangement. Peak oil would leave many Americans unable to afford petroleum based fuel for their cars, and force them to use [[bicycles]] or [[electric vehicles]]. Additional options include [[telecommuting]], moving to [[rural areas]], or moving to higher density areas, where [[walking]] and [[public transportation]] are more viable options. In the latter two cases, suburbs may become the "[[slum]]s of the future."&lt;ref name=geonowhere&gt;[[Kunstler, James Howard]] (1994).

Stressing the energy component of future development plans is seen as an important goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1221622|title=The Urban Component of the Energy Crisis|author1=Vittorio E. Pareto |author2=Marcos P. Pareto |date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising oil prices, if they occur, would also affect the cost of food, heating, and electricity. A high amount of stress would then be put on current middle to low income families as economies contract from the decline in excess funds, decreasing employment rates. The Hirsch/US DoE Report concludes that "without timely mitigation, world supply/demand balance will be achieved through massive demand destruction (shortages), accompanied by huge oil price increases, both of which would create a long period of significant economic hardship worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerswitch.org.uk/portal/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=497&amp;Itemid=2 Peak Oil UK – PowerSwitch Energy Awareness – Must read: The Hirsch/DoE report – full text&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods that have been suggested for mitigating these urban and suburban issues include the use of non-petroleum vehicles such as [[electric car]]s, [[battery electric vehicle]]s, [[transit-oriented development]], [[carfree city|carfree cities]], [[bicycle]]s, [[light rail|new trains]], [[new pedestrianism]], [[smart growth]], [[shared space]], [[urban consolidation]], [[urban village]]s, and [[New Urbanism]].

An extensive 2009 report on the effects of compact development by the [[United States National Research Council]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]], commissioned by the United States Congress, stated six main findings.&lt;ref name="Driving the Built Environment"&gt;{{cite book |title=Driving the Built Environment: The Effects of Compact Development on Motorized Travel, Energy Use, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Emissions – Special Report 298 |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12747.html |year=2009 |publisher=National Academies Press |author=Committee for the Study on the Relationships Among Development Patterns, Vehicle Miles Traveled, and Energy Consumption
|isbn=978-0-309-14422-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, that compact development is likely to reduce "Vehicle Miles Traveled" (VMT) throughout the country. Second, that doubling residential density in a given area could reduce VMT by as much as 25% if coupled with measures such as increased employment density and improved public transportation. Third, that higher density, mixed-use developments would produce both direct reductions in {{co2}} emissions (from less driving), and indirect reductions (such as from lower amounts of materials used per housing unit, higher efficiency climate control, longer vehicle lifespans, and higher efficiency delivery of goods and services). Fourth, that although short term reductions in energy use and {{co2}} emissions would be modest, that these reductions would become more significant over time. Fifth, that a major obstacle to more compact development in the United States is political resistance from local zoning regulators, which would hamper efforts by state and regional governments to participate in land-use planning. Sixth, the committee agreed that changes in development that would alter driving patterns and building efficiency would have various secondary costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify. The report recommends that policies supporting compact development (and especially its ability to reduce driving, energy use, and {{co2}} emissions) should be encouraged.

An economic theory that has been proposed as a remedy is the introduction of a [[steady state economy]]. Such a system could include a tax shifting from income to depleting natural resources (and pollution), as well as the limitation of advertising that stimulates demand and population growth. It could also include the institution of policies that move away from globalization and toward localization to conserve energy resources, provide local jobs, and maintain local decision-making authority. Zoning policies could be adjusted to promote resource conservation and eliminate sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steadystate.org/ Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postcarbon.org/article/470476-how-to-talk-about-the-end How to talk about the end of growth: Interview with Richard Heinberg&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since aviation relies mainly on [[jet fuel]]s derived from crude oil, [[commercial aviation]] has been predicted to go into decline with the global oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aviation fuels and peak oil (thesis)|author=Emma Nygren|publisher=Uppsala University, UPTEC ES08 033  | year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mitigation===
{{Main|Mitigation of peak oil}}
To avoid the serious [[society|social]] and [[economics|economic]] implications a global decline in oil production could entail, the [[Hirsch report]] emphasized the need to find alternatives, at least ten to twenty years before the peak, and to phase out the use of petroleum over that time.&lt;ref name="hirsch_report" /&gt; This was similar to [[oil phase-out in Sweden|a plan proposed for Sweden]] that same year. Such [[mitigation of peak oil|mitigation]] could include energy conservation, fuel substitution, and the use of unconventional oil. The timing of mitigation responses is critical. Premature initiation would be undesirable, but if initiated too late could be more costly and have more negative economic consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirsch|first1=Robert L.|title=Peaking of World Oil Production and Its Mitigation|journal=AIChE Journal|date=2006|volume=52|issue=1|pages=2–8|doi=10.1002/aic.10747|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive aspects===
[[Permaculture]] sees peak oil as holding tremendous potential for positive change, assuming countries act with foresight. The rebuilding of local food networks, energy production, and the general implementation of "[[energy descent]] culture" are argued to be ethical responses to the acknowledgment of finite fossil resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.futurescenarios.org/ |title= Future Scenarios – Introduction|accessdate=13 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Majorca]] is an island currently diversifying its energy supply from fossil fuels to alternative sources and looking back at traditional construction and permaculture methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islands of the Future|url=http://vimeo.com/58002043|publisher=Vimeo|accessdate=14 February 2014|language=English, Spanish|type=video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===General arguments===
The theory of peak oil is controversial and became an issue of political debate in the USA and Europe in the mid-2000s. Critics argued that newly found oil reserves forestalled a peak oil event. Some argued that oil production from new oil reserves and existing fields will continue to increase at a rate that outpaces demand, until alternate energy sources for current [[energy dependence|fossil fuel dependence]] are found.&lt;ref&gt;Business Insider – Death of peak oil – March 2013 -http://www.businessinsider.com/death-of-peak-oil-2013-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/july/peak-oil-supply-070913.html|title= Stanford researchers say 'peak oil' concerns should ease|last=Golden|first=Mark|publisher=Stanford Report|date= 9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, analysts in the petroleum and financial industries claimed that the "age of oil" had already reached a new stage where the excess supply that appeared in late 2014 may continue.&lt;ref name=Spencer&gt;{{cite report

===Oil industry representatives===
The president of [[Royal Dutch Shell]]'s U.S. operations John Hofmeister, while agreeing that conventional oil production would soon start to decline, criticized the analysis of peak oil theory by [[Matthew Simmons]] for being "overly focused on a single country: Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter and OPEC [[swing producer]]."&lt;ref name="cnbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stier|first1=Kenneth|title=The 'Peak Oil' Theory: Will Oil Reserves Run Dry?|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/23728987|website=CNBC News|accessdate=16 November 2015|date=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hofmeister pointed to the large reserves at the US [[outer continental shelf]], which held an estimated {{convert|100|Goilbbl}} of oil and natural gas. However, only 15% of those reserves were currently exploitable, a good part of that off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.&lt;ref name="cnbc.com"/&gt; 

Hofmeister also pointed to unconventional sources of oil such as the [[oil sands]] of Canada, where Shell was active. The Canadian oil sands—a natural combination of sand, water, and oil found largely in Alberta and Saskatchewan—are believed to contain one trillion barrels of oil. Another trillion barrels are also said to be trapped in rocks in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming,&lt;ref name=HofmeisterPeakOilCriticism&gt;{{cite web

He thought in 2008 that high energy prices would cause social unrest similar to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|1992 Rodney King riots]].&lt;ref name=HofmeiserCharlieRose&gt;{{cite web

In 2009, Dr. Christoph Rühl, chief economist of [[BP]], argued against the peak oil
hypothesis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{quote |
Physical peak oil, which I have no reason to accept as a valid statement either on theoretical, scientific or ideological grounds, would be insensitive to prices.&amp;nbsp;... In fact the whole hypothesis of peak oil – which is that there is a certain amount of oil in the ground, consumed at a certain rate, and then it's finished – does not react to anything&amp;nbsp;... Therefore there will never be a moment when the world runs out of oil because there will always be a price at which the last drop of oil can clear the market. And you can turn anything into oil into if you are willing to pay the financial and environmental price&amp;nbsp;... (Global Warming) is likely to be more of a natural limit than all these peak oil theories combined.&amp;nbsp;... Peak oil has been predicted for 150 years. It has never happened, and it will stay this way. |

Rühl argued that the main limitations for oil availability are "above ground" factors such as the availability of staff, expertise, technology, investment security, funds, and global warming, and that the oil question was about price and not the physical availability. 

In 2008, [[Daniel Yergin]] of [[Cambridge Energy Research Associates|CERA]] suggest that a recent high price phase might add to a future demise of the oil industry, not of complete exhaustion of resources or an apocalyptic shock but the timely and smooth setup of alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times Germany, 29 May 2008 Daniel Yergin: Öl am Wendepunkt (Oil at the turning point)&lt;/ref&gt;  Yergin went on to say, "This is the fifth time that the world is said to be running out of oil.  Each time-whether it was the 'gasoline famine' at the end of [[WWI]] or the 'permanent shortage' of the [[1970s]]-technology and the opening of new frontier areas have banished the spectre of decline. There's no reason to think that technology is finished this time."&lt;ref name="Ali"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Al-Naimi |first1=Ali |title=Out of the Desert |date=2016 |publisher=Portfolio Penguin |location=Great Britain |isbn=9780241279250 |pages=244–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Clive Mather, CEO of Shell Canada, said the Earth's supply of [[bitumen]] hydrocarbons was "almost infinite", referring to hydrocarbons in [[oil sands]].&lt;ref name="Shell Canada CEO"&gt;{{cite web

In 2006 attorney and mechanical engineer [[Peter W. Huber]] asserted that the world was just running out of "cheap oil," explaining that as oil prices rise, unconventional sources become economically viable. He predicted that, "[t]he tar sands of Alberta alone contain enough hydrocarbon to fuel the entire planet for over 100 years."&lt;ref name="Shell Canada CEO" /&gt;

Environmental journalist [[George Monbiot]] responded to a 2012 report by [[Leonardo Maugeri]]&lt;ref&gt;Maugeri, Leonardo.

}}

In the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], the '''phasm''' is an [[Aberration (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|aberration]].

==Publication history==
The phasm appeared in the third edition ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (2000),&lt;ref&gt;[[Skip Williams|Williams, Skip]], [[Jonathan Tweet]], and [[Monte Cook]]. ''[[Monster Manual]]''. [[Wizards of the Coast]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 3.5 revised ''Monster Manual'' (2003).

==Description==
A phasm resembles an amorphous blob of giant, brightly colored cells, organs, bacteria and ocean plants, roughly 5 feet in diameter and 2 feet tall, but can assume the form of almost any object or creature by using their innards as a cast. (The creature may be a bizarre form of life which has developed its organ system and cells, but has yet to obtain a permanent outer form.) It lives in underground caves.  

The phasm, though classified as an aberration, has similar habits to an [[Ooze (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|ooze]] when in normal form. When harassed or pursued, however, it morphs and develops the form of the deadliest creature it knows, and then attacks in whatever way it can in that form. When in natural form, it can attack with a [[pseudopod]]. The phasm is highly valued for various medical reasons and for study.

Phasms can speak Common, but prefer to communicate telepathically.

They are [[Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#Chaotic Neutral|chaotic neutral]] in alignment.

==Powers and abilities==
The phasm is a shapechanger, able to assume the form of any corporeal creature.  It can also communicate telepathically.

[[File:Polar bear (Ursus maritimus) with its prey.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Solitary predator: A [[polar bear]] feeds on a [[bearded seal]] it has killed.]]

'''Predation''' is a [[biological interaction]] where one organism, the '''predator''', kills and eats another organism, its '''prey'''. It is one of a family of common [[feeding behaviours]] that includes [[parasitism]] and [[micropredation]] (which usually do not kill the [[Host (biology)|host]]) and [[parasitoid]]ism (which always does, eventually). It is distinct from [[scavenging]] on dead prey, though many predators also scavenge; it overlaps with herbivory, as a seed predator is both a predator and a [[herbivore]].

Predators may actively search for prey or sit and wait for it. When prey is detected, the predator assesses whether to attack it. This may involve [[ambush predation|ambush]] or [[pursuit predation]], sometimes after stalking the prey. If the attack is successful, the predator kills the prey, removes any inedible parts like the shell or spines, and eats it.

Predators are adapted and often highly specialized for hunting, with acute senses such as [[eye|vision]], [[hearing]], or [[olfaction|smell]]. Many predatory animals, both [[vertebrate]] and [[invertebrate]], have sharp [[claw]]s or [[jaw]]s to grip, kill, and cut up their prey. Other adaptations include stealth and [[aggressive mimicry]] that improve hunting efficiency. 

Predation has a powerful [[selection pressure|selective effect]] on prey, and the prey develop [[antipredator adaptation]]s such as [[warning coloration]], [[alarm call]]s and other [[signalling theory|signals]], [[camouflage]], [[mimicry]] of well-defended species, and defensive spines and chemicals. Sometimes predator and prey find themselves in an [[evolutionary arms race]], a cycle of adaptations and counter-adaptations. Predation has been a major driver of [[evolution]] since at least the [[Cambrian]] period.

==Definition==
[[File:IndianSpiderWasp.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Pompilidae|Spider wasps]] paralyse and eventually kill their hosts, but are considered [[parasitoid]]s, not predators.]]

At the most basic level, predators kill and eat other organisms. However, the concept of predation is broad, defined differently in different contexts, and includes a wide variety of feeding methods; and some relationships that result in the prey's death are not generally called predation. A [[parasitoid]], such as an [[ichneumon wasp]], lays its eggs in or on its host; the eggs hatch into larvae, which eat the host, and it inevitably dies. Zoologists generally call this a form of [[parasitism]], though conventionally parasites are thought not to kill their hosts. A predator can be defined to differ from a parasitoid in two ways: it kills its prey immediately; and it has many prey, captured over its lifetime, where a parasitoid's larva has just one, or at least has its food supply provisioned for it on just one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gurr |first1=Geoff M. |last2=Wratten |first2=Stephen D. |last3=Snyder |first3=William E. |title=Biodiversity and Insect Pests: Key Issues for Sustainable Management |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ng4hIDQ_k8C&amp;pg=PT105 |year=2012 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-118-23185-2 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LaffertyKuris2002/&gt; 

[[File:Predation's Boundaries.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Relation of predation to other feeding strategies]]

There are other difficult and borderline cases. [[Micropredator]]s are small animals that, like predators, feed entirely on other organisms; they include [[flea]]s and [[mosquito]]es that consume blood from living animals, and [[aphid]]s that consume sap from living plants. However, since they typically do not kill their hosts, they are now often thought of as parasites.&lt;ref name=PoulinRandhawa2015&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poulin |first1=Robert |author1link=Robert Poulin (zoologist) |last2=Randhawa |first2=Haseeb S. |title=Evolution of parasitism along convergent lines: from ecology to genomics |journal=Parasitology |date=February 2015 |volume=142 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S6–S15 |doi=10.1017/S0031182013001674 |pmc=4413784 |pmid=24229807}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rollinson&gt;{{cite book |author=Poulin, Robert |authorlink=Robert Poulin (zoologist) |editor1=Rollinson, D. |editor2=Hay, S.

While examples of predators among mammals and birds are well known,&lt;ref name=Stevens2010/&gt; predators can be found in a broad range of taxa. They are common among insects, including mantids, [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]], [[Neuroptera|lacewings]] and [[Mecoptera|scorpionflies]]. In some species such as the [[alderfly]], only the larvae are predatory (the adults do not eat). Spiders are predatory, as well as other terrestrial invertebrates such as [[scorpion]]s; [[centipede]]s; some [[mite]]s, [[snail]]s and [[slug]]s; [[nematode]]s; and [[Planarian|planarian worms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Predators, parasites and parasitoids |url=https://australianmuseum.net.au/predators-parasites-and-parasitoids |website=Australian Museum |accessdate=19 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In marine environments, most [[cnidaria|cnidarians]] (e.g., [[jellyfish]], [[hydroid (zoology)|hydroids]]), [[ctenophora]] (comb jellies), [[echinoderm]]s (e.g., [[sea stars]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[sand dollar]]s, and [[sea cucumber]]s) and [[flatworm]]s are predatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Watanabe|first1=James M. |title=Invertebrates, overview |editor-last1=Denny |editor-first1=Mark W. |editor-last2=Gaines |editor-first2=Steven Dean |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of tidepools and rocky shores |date=2007 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520251182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[crustacean]]s, [[lobster]]s, [[crab]]s, [[shrimp]]s and [[barnacle]]s are predators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Phelan |first1=Jay |title=What Is life? : a guide to biology |date=2009 |publisher=W.H.

Sharks, [[Molidae|sunfish]], [[Insectivorous]] birds and [[shrew]]s are almost always moving while web-building spiders, aquatic invertebrates, praying mantises and [[kestrel]]s rarely move. In between, [[plover]]s and other [[shorebirds]], freshwater fish including [[crappie]]s, and the larvae of [[Coccinellidae|coccinellid beetles (ladybirds)]], alternate between actively searching and scanning the environment.&lt;ref name=Bell4/&gt;

[[File:Thalassarche melanophrys in flight 2 - SE Tasmania.jpg|thumb|left|The [[black-browed albatross]] regularly flies hundreds of kilometres across the nearly empty ocean to find patches of food.]]

Prey distributions are often clumped, and predators respond by looking for ''patches'' where prey is dense and then searching within patches.&lt;ref name=Kramer2001/&gt; Where food is found in patches, such as rare shoals of fish in a nearly empty ocean, the search stage requires the predator to travel for a substantial time, and to expend a significant amount of energy, to locate each food patch.&lt;ref name=Bell2012/&gt; For example, the [[black-browed albatross]] regularly makes foraging flights to a range of around {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=off|-1}}, up to a maximum foraging range of {{convert|3000|km|mi|abbr=off|-1}} for breeding birds gathering food for their young.{{efn|A range of 3000 kilometres means a flight distance of at least 6000 kilometres out and back.}}&lt;ref name="Gremillet2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gremillet |first1=D. |last2=Wilson |first2=R.

===Assessment===
[[File:Ladybug aphids.JPG|thumb|[[Seven-spot ladybird]]s select plants of good quality for their [[aphid]] prey.]]

Having found prey, a predator must decide whether to pursue it or keep searching. The decision depends on the costs and benefits involved. A bird foraging for insects spends a lot of time searching but capturing and eating them is quick and easy, so the efficient strategy for the bird is to eat every palatable insect it finds. By contrast, a predator such as a lion or falcon finds its prey easily but capturing it requires a lot of effort. In that case, the predator is more selective.&lt;ref name=Pianka/&gt; 

One of the factors to consider is size. Prey that is too small may not be worth the trouble for the amount of energy it provides. Too large, and it may be too difficult to capture. For example, a mantid captures prey with its forelegs and they are optimized for grabbing prey of a certain size. Mantids are reluctant to attack prey that is far from that size. There is a positive correlation between the size of a predator and its prey.&lt;ref name=Pianka/&gt;

A predator may also assess a patch and decide whether to spend time searching for prey in it.&lt;ref name=Kramer2001/&gt; This may involve some knowledge of the preferences of the prey; for example, [[ladybird]]s can choose a patch of vegetation suitable for their [[aphid]] prey.&lt;ref name="WilliamsFlaxman2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Williams | first=Amanda C. | last2=Flaxman | first2=Samuel M. | title=Can predators assess the quality of their prey's resource? | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=83 | issue=4 | year=2012 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.01.008 | pages=883–890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capture===

To capture prey, predators have a spectrum of pursuit modes that range from overt chase (also known as ''[[pursuit predation]]'') to a sudden strike on nearby prey (''[[ambush predator|ambush predation]]'').&lt;ref name=Kramer2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scharf |first=Inon |last2=Nulman |first2=Einat |last3=Ovadia |first3=Ofer |last4=Bouskila |first4=Amos |date=September 2006 |title=Efficiency evaluation of two competing foraging modes under different conditions |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=168 |issue=3 |pages=350–357 |doi=10.1086/506921 |pmid=16947110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stevens2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stevens, Alison N.

Ambush or sit-and-wait predators are carnivorous animals that capture prey by stealth or surprise. In animals, ambush predation is characterized by the predator's scanning the environment from a concealed position until a prey is spotted, and then rapidly executing a fixed surprise attack.&lt;ref name=deVries&gt;{{cite journal |author=deVries, M.

Some ambush predators also use lures to attract prey within striking range.&lt;ref name="MooreBiewener2015"/&gt; The capturing movement has to be rapid to trap the prey, given that the attack is not modifiable once launched.&lt;ref name="MooreBiewener2015"/&gt;

{{anchor|Ballistic}}
====Ballistic interception====
[[File:Chameleon gab fbi.png|thumb|The [[chameleon]] attacks prey by shooting out its tongue.]]

Ballistic interception is the strategy where a predator observes the movement of a prey, predicts its motion, works out an interception path, and then attacks the prey on that path. This differs from ambush predation in that the predator adjusts its attack according to how the prey is moving.&lt;ref name="MooreBiewener2015"/&gt;  Ballistic interception involves a brief period for planning, giving the prey an opportunity to escape. Some frogs wait until snakes have begun their strike before jumping, reducing the time available to the snake to recalibrate its attack, and maximising the angular adjustment that the snake would need to make to intercept the frog in real time.&lt;ref name="MooreBiewener2015"/&gt; Ballistic predators include insects such as dragonflies, and vertebrates such as [[archerfish]] (attacking with a jet of water), [[chameleon]]s (attacking with their tongues), and some [[Colubridae|colubrid snakes]].&lt;ref name="MooreBiewener2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Moore | first=Talia Y. | last2=Biewener | first2=Andrew A. | title=Outrun or Outmaneuver: Predator–Prey Interactions as a Model System for Integrating Biomechanical Studies in a Broader Ecological and Evolutionary Context | journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume=55 | issue=6 | pages=1188–97 | date=2015 | doi=10.1093/icb/icv074 | pmid=26117833 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/25858000/MooreICB2015_Preprint.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pursuit predation, predators chase fleeing prey. If the prey flees in a straight line, capture depends only on the predator's being faster than the prey.&lt;ref name="MooreBiewener2015"/&gt; If the prey manoeuvres by turning as it flees, the predator must react in real time to calculate and follow a new intercept path, such as by [[parallel navigation]], as it closes on the prey.&lt;ref name="MooreBiewener2015"/&gt; Many pursuit predators use camouflage to approach the prey as close as possible unobserved (''stalking'') before starting the pursuit.&lt;ref name="MooreBiewener2015"/&gt; Pursuit predators include terrestrial mammals such as lions, cheetahs, and wolves; marine predators such as dolphins and many predatory fishes, such as tuna;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gazda | first1=S.

An extreme form of pursuit is [[Persistence hunting|endurance or persistence hunting]], in which the predator tires out the prey by following it over a long distance, sometimes for hours at a time. The method is used by human [[hunter-gatherer]]s and in [[Canidae|canids]] such as [[African wild dog]]s and domestic hounds. The African wild dog is an extreme persistence predator, tiring out individual prey by following them for many miles at relatively low speed, compared for example to the [[cheetah]]'s brief high-speed pursuit.&lt;ref name="HubelMyattJordanDewhirst2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hubel | first=Tatjana Y. | last2=Myatt | first2=Julia P. | last3=Jordan | first3=Neil R. | last4=Dewhirst | first4=Oliver P. | last5=McNutt | first5=J.

A specialised form of pursuit predation is the [[lunge feed]]ing of [[baleen whale]]s. These very large marine predators feed on [[plankton]], especially [[krill]], diving and actively swimming into concentrations of plankton, and then taking a huge gulp of water and filtering it through their feathery [[baleen]] plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Goldbogen | first1=J.

Pursuit predators may be [[Social predator|social]], like the lion and wolf that hunt in groups, or solitary, like the cheetah.&lt;ref name=LaffertyKuris2002/&gt;&lt;!--Ambush predators are often solitary.--&gt;

===Handling===
{{multiple image|align=right|image1=Bluecat5A.jpg|width1=225|caption1=[[Catfish]] has sharp [[fish fin|dorsal and pectoral spines]] which it holds erect to discourage predators such as [[heron]]s which swallow prey whole.|image2=Osprey eating a fish.jpg|width2=165|caption2=[[Osprey]] tears its fish prey apart, avoiding dangers such as sharp spines.}}

Once the predator has captured the prey, it has to handle it: very carefully if the prey is dangerous to eat, such as if it possesses sharp or poisonous spines, as in many prey fish. Some [[catfish]] such as the [[Ictaluridae]] have [[fish fin|spines on the back (dorsal) and belly (pectoral)]] which lock in the erect position; as the catfish thrashes about when captured, these could pierce the predator's mouth, possibly fatally. Some fish-eating birds like the [[osprey]] avoid the danger of spines by tearing up their prey before eating it.&lt;ref name="Forbes1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Forbes | first=L.

===Solitary versus social predation===
{{See also|Cooperative hunting}}

In social predation, a group of predators cooperates to kill prey.

==Specialization==

===Physical adaptations===

Under the pressure of [[natural selection]], predators have evolved a variety of physical [[adaptation]]s for detecting, catching, killing, and digesting prey. These include speed, agility, stealth, sharp senses, claws, teeth, filters, and suitable digestive systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bar-Yam |title=Predator-Prey Relationships |url=http://necsi.edu/projects/evolution/co-evolution/pred-prey/co-evolution_predator.html |publisher=New England Complex Systems Institute |accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Prey detection|detecting prey]], predators have well-developed [[eye|vision]], [[olfaction|smell]], or [[hearing]].&lt;ref name=Stevens2010/&gt; Predators as diverse as [[owl]]s and [[jumping spider]]s have forward-facing eyes, providing accurate [[binocular vision]] over a relatively narrow field of view, whereas prey animals often have less acute all-round vision. Animals such as foxes can smell their prey even when it is concealed under {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1}} of snow or earth. Many predators have acute hearing, and some such as [[animal echolocation|echolocating]] [[bat]]s hunt exclusively by active or passive use of sound.&lt;ref name="RSM2012"&gt;{{cite web |title=Predator &amp; Prey: Adaptations |url=https://royalsaskmuseum.ca/pub/Lesson%20Plans/Resources/Predator%20and%20Prey%20Adaptations.pdf |publisher=Royal Saskatchewan Museum |accessdate=19 April 2018 |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predators including [[big cat]]s, [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], and ants share powerful jaws, sharp teeth, or claws which they use to seize and kill their prey. Some predators such as [[snake]]s and fish-eating birds like [[herons]] and [[cormorants]] swallow their prey whole; some snakes can unhinge their jaws to allow them to swallow large prey, while fish-eating birds have long spear-like beaks that they use to stab and grip fast-moving and slippery prey.&lt;ref name="RSM2012"/&gt; Fish and other predators have developed the ability to crush or open the armoured shells of molluscs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vermeij |first=Geerat J. |title=Evolution and Escalation: An Ecological History of Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3pCQ6ks5PEC&amp;pg=PR11 |year=1993 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-00080-0 |pages=11 and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many predators are powerfully built and can catch and kill animals larger than themselves; this applies as much to small predators such as [[ant]]s and [[shrew]]s as to big and visibly muscular carnivores like the [[cougar]] and [[lion]].&lt;ref name="RSM2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=LaffertyKuris2002&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lafferty,  K.

Members of the [[Felidae|cat family]] such as the [[snow leopard]] (treeless highlands), [[tiger]] (grassy plains, reed swamps), [[ocelot]] (forest), [[fishing cat]] (waterside thickets), and [[lion]] (open plains) are camouflaged with coloration and [[disruptive pattern]]s suiting their habitats.&lt;ref name=Cott12&gt;{{harvnb|Cott|1940|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venom===

Physiological adaptations to predation include the ability of predatory bacteria to digest the complex [[peptidoglycan]] polymer from the [[cell wall]]s of the bacteria that they prey upon.&lt;ref name="JurkevitchDavidov2006"/&gt; Carnivorous vertebrates of all five major classes (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) have lower relative rates of sugar to [[amino acid]] transport than either herbivores or omnivores, presumably because they acquire plenty of amino acids from the animal [[protein]]s in their diet.&lt;ref name="KarasovDiamond1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Karasov | first=William H. | last2=Diamond | first2=Jared M. | title=Interplay between Physiology and Ecology in Digestion | journal=BioScience | volume=38 | issue=9 | year=1988 | doi=10.2307/1310825 | pages=602–611 |jstor=1310825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antipredator adaptations ==
{{main|Antipredator adaptation}}

To counter predation, prey have a great variety of defences. They can try to avoid detection. They can detect predators and warn others of their presence. If detected, they can try to avoid being the target of an attack, for example, by signalling that a chase would be unprofitable or by forming groups. If they become a target, they can try to fend off the attack with defences such as armour, quills, unpalatability or mobbing; and they can escape an attack in progress by [[deimatic behaviour|startling]] the predator, shedding body parts such as tails, or simply fleeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caro |2005|pages=v&amp;ndash;xi, 4&amp;ndash;5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|pages=vii&amp;ndash;xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stevens2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Edmunds1974&gt;{{cite book |last=Edmunds |first=M. |title=Defence in Animals |date=1974 |publisher=Longman |isbn=978-0582441323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avoiding detection===
Prey can avoid detection by predators with morphological traits and coloration that make them hard to detect. They can also adopt behaviour that avoids predators by, for example, avoiding the times and places where predators forage.&lt;ref name=CaroCh3&gt;{{harvnb|Caro|2005|pages=67–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Misdirection====

Prey animals make use of a variety of mechanisms including [[camouflage]] and [[mimicry]] to misdirect the visual sensory mechanisms of predators, enabling the prey to remain unrecognized for long enough to give it an opportunity to escape. Camouflage delays recognition through coloration, shape, and pattern.&lt;ref name="RSM2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Merilaita Scott-Samuel Cuthill p=20160341"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Merilaita | first=Sami | last2=Scott-Samuel | first2=Nicholas E. | last3=Cuthill | first3=Innes C. | author3link=Innes Cuthill | title=How camouflage works | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume=372 | issue=1724 | date=2017-05-22 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2016.0341 | pmid=28533458 | pmc=5444062 | page=20160341| url=https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/how-camouflage-works(4f4ea74b-ee08-4b99-b785-cc9713677ab6).html | type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many [[list of camouflage methods|mechanisms of camouflage]] are [[countershading]]&lt;ref name=Cott12/&gt; and [[disruptive coloration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cott|1940|pages=35–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resemblance can be to the biotic or non-living environment, such as a [[mantis]] resembling dead leaves, or to other organisms. In mimicry, an organism has a similar appearance to another species, as in the [[drone fly]], which resembles a [[bee]] yet has no sting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cott|1940|pages=396–416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Behavioural mechanisms====
[[File:BlackWoods.jpg|thumb|left|[[Black woodpecker]] attending its chicks, relatively safe inside an excavated hole in a tree]]

Animals avoid predators with behavioural mechanisms such as changing their habitats (particularly when raising young), reducing their activity, foraging less and forgoing reproduction when they sense that predators are about.&lt;ref name=Caro112&gt;{{harvnb|Caro|2005|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eggs and nestlings are particularly vulnerable to predation, so birds take measures to protect their nests.&lt;ref name=CaroCh3/&gt; Where birds locate their nests can have a large effect on the frequency of predation. It is lowest for those such as [[woodpecker]]s that excavate their own nests and progressively higher for those on the ground, in canopies and in shrubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caro|2005|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; To compensate, shrub nesters must have more broods and shorter nesting times. Birds also choose appropriate habitat (e.g., thick foliage or islands) and avoid forest edges and small habitats. Similarly, some mammals raise their young in dens.&lt;ref name=Caro112/&gt;

By forming groups, prey can often reduce the frequency of encounters with predators because the visibility of a group does not rise in proportion to its size. However, there are exceptions: for example, human fishermen can only detect large shoals of fish with [[sonar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beauchamp|2012|pages=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detecting predators===

====Recognition====
Prey species use sight, sound and odor to detect predators, and they can be quite discriminating. For example, [[Belding's ground squirrel]] can distinguish several aerial and ground predators from each other and from harmless species. Prey also distinguish between the calls of predators and non-predators. Some species can even distinguish between dangerous and harmless predators of the same species. In the northeastern Pacific Ocean, transient killer whales prey on seals, but the local killer whales only eat fish. Seals rapidly exit the water if they hear calls between transients. Prey are also more vigilant if they smell predators.&lt;ref name=Caro13&gt;{{harvnb|Caro|2005|pages=13&amp;ndash;15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abilities of prey to detect predators do have limits. Belding's ground squirrel cannot distinguish between [[Harrier (bird)|harriers]] flying at different heights, although only the low-flying birds are a threat.&lt;ref name=Caro13/&gt; Wading birds sometimes take flight when there does not appear to be any predator present. Although such false alarms waste energy and lose feeding time, it can be fatal to make the opposite mistake of taking a predator for a harmless animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vigilance====
{{further|Signalling theory}}
Prey must remain ''vigilant'', scanning their surroundings for predators. This makes it more difficult to feed and sleep. Groups can provide more eyes, making detection of a predator more likely and reducing the level of vigilance needed by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caro|2005|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species, such as [[Eurasian jay]]s, give [[alarm call]]s warning of the presence of a predator; these give other prey of the same or different species an opportunity to escape, and signal to the predator that it has been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bergstrom |first=C.

If predator and prey have spotted each other, the prey can signal to the predator to decrease the likelihood of an attack. These ''[[honest signal]]s'' may benefit both the prey and predator, because they save the effort of a fruitless chase.&lt;ref name=Ruxton70&gt;{{harvnb|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|pages=70–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signals that appear to deter attacks include [[stotting]], for example by [[Thomson's gazelle]];&lt;ref name=Caro1986&gt;{{harvnb|Caro|2005|pages=663–684}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruxton70/&gt; push-up displays by lizards;&lt;ref name=Ruxton70/&gt; and good singing by skylarks after a pursuit begins.&lt;ref name=Ruxton70/&gt; Simply indicating that the predator has been spotted, as a hare does by standing on its hind legs and facing the predator, may sometimes be sufficient.&lt;ref name=Ruxton70/&gt; 

Many prey animals are [[Aposematism|aposematically]] coloured or patterned as a warning to predators that they are distasteful or able to defend themselves.&lt;ref name="RSM2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cott|1940|pages=241–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bowers1985&gt;Bowers, M.

====Forming groups====
By forming groups, prey can reduce attacks by predators. There are several mechanisms that produce this effect. One is ''dilution'', where, in the simplest scenario, if a given predator attacks a group of prey, the chances of a given individual being the target is reduced in proportion to the size of the group. However, it is difficult to separate this effect from other group-related benefits such as increased vigilance and reduced encounter rate.&lt;ref name=BeauchampCh3&gt;{{harvnb|Beauchamp|2012|pages=83–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krause |first1=Jens |last2=Ruxton |first2=Graeme D. |title=Living in groups |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198508182 |pages=13–15|date=2002-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other advantages include confusing predators such as with [[motion dazzle]], making it more difficult to single out a target.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caro |2005|pages=275–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944200613000974 |title=Motion camouflage induced by zebra stripes |author1=How, Martin J. |author2=Zanker, Johannes M. |journal=Zoology |year=2014 |pages=163–170 |doi=10.1016/j.zool.2013.10.004 |pmid=24368147 |volume=117 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coevolution ==
{{further|Coevolution}}
[[File:Big-eared-townsend-fledermaus.jpg|thumb|left|Bats use [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to hunt moths at night.]]

Predators and prey are natural enemies, and many of their adaptations seem designed to counter each other. For example, bats have sophisticated [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] systems to detect insects and other prey, and insects have developed a variety of defences including the ability to hear the echolocation calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobs|Bastian|2017|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barbosa |first1=Pedro |last2=Castellanos |first2=Ignacio |title=Ecology of predator-prey interactions |date=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199874545|url=|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many pursuit predators that run on land, such as wolves, have evolved long limbs in response to the increased speed of their prey.&lt;ref name=Janis&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Janis | first1=C.

R. |author2link=John Krebs, Baron Krebs |year=1979 |title=Arms races between and within species |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=205 |pages=489–511}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[gene centered view of evolution]], the genes of predator and prey can be thought of as [[Competition (biology)|competing]] for the prey's body.&lt;ref name=DawKrebs/&gt; However, the "life-dinner" principle of Dawkins and Krebs predicts that this arms race is asymmetric: if a predator fails to catch its prey, it loses its dinner, while if it succeeds, the prey loses its life.&lt;ref name=DawKrebs/&gt;

[[File:Micrurus fulviusHolbrookV3P10AA.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Micrurus fulvius|Eastern coral snake]], itself a predator, is venomous enough to kill predators that attack it, so when they avoid it, this behaviour must be inherited, not learnt.]]

The metaphor of an arms race implies ever-escalating advances in attack and defence. However, these adaptations come with a cost; for instance, longer legs have an increased risk of breaking,&lt;ref name=Abrams&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abrams |first1=Peter A. |title=Adaptive responses of predators to prey and prey to predators: The failure of the arms-race analogy |journal=Evolution |date=November 1986 |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=1229–1247 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1986.tb05747.x|pmid=28563514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the specialized tongue of the chameleon, with its ability to act like a projectile, is useless for lapping water, so the chameleon must drink dew off vegetation.&lt;ref name=Brodie&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brodie |first1=Edmund D. |last2=Brodie |first2=Edmund D. |title=Predator-Prey Arms Races |journal=BioScience |date=July 1999 |volume=49 |issue=7 |pages=557–568 |doi=10.2307/1313476|jstor=1313476 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "life-dinner" principle has been criticized on multiple grounds. The extent of the asymmetry in natural selection depends in part on the heritability of the adaptive traits.&lt;ref name=Brodie/&gt; Also, if a predator loses enough dinners, it too will lose its life.&lt;ref name=Abrams/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brodie/&gt; On the other hand, the fitness cost of a given lost dinner is unpredictable, as the predator may quickly find better prey. In addition, most predators are generalists, which reduces the impact of a given prey adaption on a predator. Since specialization is caused by predator-prey coevolution, the rarity of specialists may imply that predator-prey arms races are rare.&lt;ref name=Brodie/&gt;

It is difficult to determine whether given adaptations are truly the result of coevolution, where a prey adaptation gives rise to a predator adaptation that is countered by further adaptation in the prey. An alternative explanation is ''escalation'', where predators are adapting to competitors, their own predators or dangerous prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vermeij |first1=G J |title=The Evolutionary Interaction Among Species: Selection, Escalation, and Coevolution |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |date=November 1994 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=219–236 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.25.110194.001251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparent adaptations to predation may also have arisen for other reasons and then been co-opted for attack or defence. In some of the insects preyed on by bats, hearing evolved before bats appeared and was used to hear signals used for territorial defence and mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobs|Bastian|2017|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their hearing evolved in response to bat predation, but the only clear example of reciprocal adaptation in bats is stealth echolocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobs|Bastian|2017|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more symmetric arms race may occur when the prey are dangerous, having spines, quills, toxins or venom that can harm the predator. The predator can respond with avoidance, which in turn drives the evolution of mimicry. Avoidance is not necessarily an evolutionary response as it is generally learned from bad experiences with prey. However, when the prey is capable of killing the predator (as can a [[coral snake]] with its venom), there is no opportunity for learning and avoidance must be inherited. Predators can also respond to dangerous prey with counter-adaptations. In western North America, the [[common garter snake]] has developed a resistance to the toxin in the skin of the [[rough-skinned newt]].&lt;ref name=Brodie/&gt;

Predators may increase the [[biodiversity]] of communities by preventing a single species from becoming dominant.

The elimination of wolves from [[Yellowstone National Park]] had profound impacts on the [[trophic pyramid]]. In that area, wolves are both keystone species and apex predators. Without predation, herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species, affecting the area's plant populations. In addition, wolves often kept animals from grazing near streams, protecting the [[beaver]]s' food sources. The removal of wolves had a direct effect on the beaver population, as their habitat became territory for grazing. Increased browsing on [[willow]]s and [[conifer]]s along Blacktail Creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because the reduced beaver population was no longer able to slow the water down and keep the soil in place. The predators were thus demonstrated to be of vital importance in the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Ripple2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ripple | first=William J. | last2=Beschta | first2=Robert L. | title=Wolves and the Ecology of Fear: Can Predation Risk Structure Ecosystems? | journal=BioScience | volume=54 | issue=8 | year=2004 | doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0755:WATEOF]2.0.CO;2 | page=755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lotka-Volterra equations rely on several simplifying assumptions, and they are [[structural stability|structurally unstable]], meaning that any change in the equations can stabilize or destabilize the dynamics.&lt;ref name=Murdoch&gt;{{cite book |last1=Murdoch |first1=William W. |last2=Briggs |first2=Cheryl J. |last3=Nisbet |first3=Roger M. |title=Consumer-resource dynamics |date=2013 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400847259|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nowak |first1=Martin |last2=May |first2=Robert M. |title=Virus Dynamics : Mathematical Principles of Immunology and Virology |date=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191588518 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one assumption is that predators have a linear [[functional response]] to prey: the rate of kills increases in proportion to the rate of encounters. If this rate is limited by time spent handling each catch, then prey populations can reach densities above which predators cannot control them.&lt;ref name=Princeton/&gt; Another assumption is that all prey individuals are identical. In reality, predators tend to select young, weak, and ill individuals, leaving prey populations able to regrow.&lt;ref name="Genovart2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Genovart | first1=M. | last2=Negre | first2=N. | last3=Tavecchia | first3=G. | last4=Bistuer | first4=A. | last5=Parpal | first5=L. | last6=Oro | first6=D. | year=2010 | title=The young, the weak and the sick: evidence of natural selection by predation | journal=PLOS ONE | volume=5 | issue=3 | page=e9774 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0009774 | pmid=20333305 | pmc=2841644| bibcode=2010PLoSO...5.9774G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many factors can stabilize predator and prey populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rockwood|2009|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the presence of multiple predators, particularly generalists that are attracted to a given prey species if it is abundant and look elsewhere if it is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rockwood|2009|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, population cycles are only found in northern temperate and [[subarctic]] ecosystems because the food webs are simpler.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rockwood|2009|pages=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; The snowshoe hare-lynx system is subarctic, but even this involves other predators, including coyotes, [[goshawk]]s and [[great horned owl]]s, and the cycle is reinforced by variations in the food available to the hares.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rockwood|2009|page=272–273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mathematical models have been developed by relaxing the assumptions made in the Lotka-Volterra model; these variously allow animals to have [[spatial distribution|geographic distribution]]s, or to [[animal migration|migrate]]; to have differences between individuals, such as [[sex]]es and an [[age structure]], so that only some individuals reproduce; to live in a varying environment, such as with changing [[season]]s;&lt;ref name="Cushing2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cushing |first1=J.

== Evolutionary history ==
{{further|Evolutionary history of life}}

Predation predates the rise of commonly recognized carnivores by hundreds of millions (perhaps billions) of years. Predation has evolved repeatedly in different groups of organisms.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Abrams, P. A. |date=2000 |title=The evolution of predator-prey interactions: theory and evidence |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=31 |pages=79–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of [[eukaryotic]] cells at around 2.7 Gya, the rise of multicellular organisms at about 2 Gya, and the rise of mobile predators (around 600 Mya - 2 Gya, probably around 1 Gya) have all been attributed to early predatory behavior,and many very early remains show evidence of boreholes or other markings attributed to small predator species.&lt;ref name=Bengtson2002 /&gt; It likely triggered major evolutionary transitions including the arrival of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[eukaryote]]s, [[sexual reproduction]], [[multicellularity]], increased size, mobility (including [[insect flight]]&lt;ref name=GrimaldiEngel2005/&gt;) and armoured shells and exoskeletons.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002"/&gt; 

The earliest predators were microbial organisms, which engulfed or grazed on others. Because the fossil record is poor, these first predators could date back anywhere between 1 and over 2.7 Gya (billion years ago).&lt;ref name=Bengtson2002/&gt; Predation visibly became important shortly before the [[Cambrian]] period—around {{Ma |550}}—as evidenced by the almost simultaneous development of [[calcification]] in animals and algae,&lt;ref name="Grant1991"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Grant, S.

In political science, a '''revolution''' ([[Latin]]: ''revolutio'', "a turn around") is a fundamental and relatively sudden change in political power and political organization which occurs when the population revolt against the government, typically due to perceived oppression (political, social, economic).&lt;ref&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition (1999), Allan Bullock and Stephen Trombley, Eds. pp. 754–46&lt;/ref&gt; In book V of the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) described two types of political revolution:
# Complete change from one constitution to another
# Modification of an existing constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.5.five.html ''The Politics'' V]. Accessed 2013/4/24&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolutions have occurred through human history and vary widely in terms of methods, duration and motivating [[ideology]]. Their results include major changes in culture, economy and [[social institution|socio]]-[[political institution]]s, usually in response to perceived overwhelming [[autocracy]] or [[plutocracy]].

Scholarly debates about what does and does not constitute a revolution center on several issues. Early studies of revolutions primarily analyzed events in [[European history]] from a psychological perspective, but more modern examinations include global events and incorporate perspectives from several social sciences, including [[sociology]] and [[political science]]. Several generations of scholarly thought on revolutions have generated many competing theories and contributed much to the current understanding of this complex phenomenon.

Notable revolutions during later centuries include the creation of the [[United States]] through the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775-1783), the [[French Revolution]] (1789-1799), the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 European Revolutions]], The [[Russian Revolutions]] in March and November 1917.  


==Etymology==
The word ''"revolucion"'' is known in [[French language|French]] from the 13th century, and "revolution" in [[English language|English]] by the late fourteenth century, with regard to the revolving motion of celestial bodies. "Revolution" in the sense of representing abrupt change in a [[social order]] is attested by at least 1450.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] vol Q-R p. 617 1979 Sense III states a usage "Alteration, change, mutation" from 1400 but lists it as "rare". "c. 1450, Lydg 1196 ''Secrees'' of Elementys the Revoluciuons, Chaung of tymes and Complexiouns." It's clear that the usage had been established by the early 15th century but only came into common use in the late 17th century in England.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=revolution onlineetymology.com ]&lt;/ref&gt; Political usage of the term had been well established by 1688 in the description of the replacement of [[James II of England|James II]] with [[William III of Orange|William III]]. This incident was termed the ''"[[Glorious Revolution]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, ''[http://chagala.com/russia/pipes.htm A Concise History of the Russian Revolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511130014/http://chagala.com/russia/pipes.htm |date=2011-05-11 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;


==Types==
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Watt steam engine]] in [[Madrid]]. The development of the [[steam engine]] propelled the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain and the world. The steam engine was created to pump water from [[coal mine]]s, enabling them to be deepened beyond [[groundwater]] levels.]]

There are many different typologies of revolutions in social science and literature.

[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] differentiated between; 
* [[political revolution]]s, sudden and violent revolutions that seek not only to establish a new political system but to transform an entire society, and; 
* slow but sweeping transformations of the entire society that take several generations to bring about (such as changes in religion).&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Boesche]], ''Tocqueville's Road Map: Methodology, Liberalism, Revolution, and Despotism'', Lexington Books, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7391-1665-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fLL6Bil2gtcC&amp;pg=PA86 p.86]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of several different [[Marxism|Marxist]] typologies &lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} J. Topolski, "''Rewolucje w dziejach nowożytnych i najnowszych (xvii-xx wiek)''", ''Kwartalnik Historyczny'', LXXXIII, 1976, 251-67&lt;/ref&gt; divides revolutions into; 
* pre-capitalist 
* early bourgeois, 
* bourgeois, 
* bourgeois-democratic, 
* early proletarian 
* socialist

[[Charles Tilly]], a modern scholar of revolutions, differentiated between; 
* [[coup d'état]] (a top-down seizure of power) 
* [[civil war]] 
* revolt, and 
* "great revolution" (a revolution that transforms economic and social structures as well as political institutions, such as the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], or [[Islamic Revolution of Iran]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Tilly]], ''''European Revolutions, 1492-1992'', Blackwell Publishing, 1995, {{ISBN|0-631-19903-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IJBNvCsXfnIC&amp;pg=PA16 Google Print, p.16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/mel/lewis.html Bernard Lewis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429144545/http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/mel/lewis.html |date=2007-04-29 }}, "Iran in History", Moshe Dayan Center, Tel Aviv University&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Katz]]&lt;ref&gt;Mark N Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p4&lt;/ref&gt; identified six forms of revolution;
* rural revolution
* urban revolution
* Coup d'état, e.g. Egypt, 1952
* revolution from above, e.g. Mao's [[Great leap forward]] of 1958
* revolution from without, e.g. the allied invasions of Italy, 1944 and Germany, 1945.
* revolution by osmosis, e.g. the gradual Islamization of several countries.

These categories are not mutually exclusive; the [[Russian revolution of 1917]] began with urban revolution to depose the Czar, followed by rural revolution, followed by the [[Bolshevik]] coup in November. Katz also cross-classified revolutions as follows;
* Central; countries, usually [[Great powers]], which play a leading role in a [[Revolutionary wave]]; e.g. the [[USSR]], [[Nazi Germany]], [[Iran]] since 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Mark N Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p13&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aspiring revolutions, which follow the Central revolution
* subordinate or puppet revolutions
* rival revolutions, e.g. communist Yugoslavia, and China after 1969

A further dimension to Katz's typology&lt;ref&gt;Mark N Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p12&lt;/ref&gt; is that revolutions are either '''against''' (anti-monarchy, anti-dictatorial, anti-communist, anti-democratic) or '''for''' (pro-fascism, communism, nationalism etc.).In the latter cases, a transition period is often necessary to decide on the direction taken.

Other types of revolution, created for other typologies, include the [[social revolution]]s; [[proletarian revolution|proletarian]] or [[communist revolution]]s (inspired by the ideas of Marxism that aims to replace [[capitalism]] with [[Communism]]); failed or abortive revolutions (revolutions that fail to secure power after temporary victories or large-scale mobilization); or violent vs. [[nonviolent revolution]]s.

The term ''revolution'' has also been used to denote great changes outside the political sphere. Such revolutions are usually recognized as having transformed in society, culture, philosophy, and technology much more than [[political system]]s; they are often known as [[social revolution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Irving E. Fang, ''A History of Mass Communication: Six Information Revolutions'', Focal Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-240-80254-3}}, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; Some can be global, while others are limited to single countries. One of the classic examples of the usage of the word ''revolution'' in such context is the [[Industrial Revolution]], or the [[Commercial Revolution]]. Note that such revolutions also fit the "slow revolution" definition of Tocqueville.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Warwick E. ''Geographies of Globalization''. Routledge, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-31800-9}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-3Vq3aadTYC&amp;pg=PA226 p.226]&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar example is the [[Digital Revolution]].

==Political and socioeconomic revolutions==
Perhaps most often, the word "revolution" is employed to denote a change in social and political institutions.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"&gt;[[Jack Goldstone]], "Theories of Revolutions: The Third Generation'', ''[[World Politics]]'' 32, 1980:425-53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forantorr"&gt;[[John Foran (sociologist)|John Foran]], "Theories of Revolution Revisited: Toward a Fourth Generation", ''[[Sociological Theory (journal)|Sociological Theory]]'' 11, 1993:1-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kroeber"&gt;Clifton B. Kroeber, "Theory and History of Revolution, ''[[Journal of World History]]'' 7.1, 1996: 21-40&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Goodwin]] gives two definitions of a revolution. First, a broad one, including
&lt;blockquote&gt;any and all instances in which a state or a political regime is overthrown and thereby transformed by a popular movement in an irregular, extraconstitutional and/or violent fashion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Second, a narrow one, in which

&lt;blockquote&gt;revolutions entail not only [[mass mobilization]] and [[regime change]], but also more or less rapid and fundamental social, economic and/or cultural change, during or soon after the struggle for state power.&lt;ref name="NOWO:9"&gt;Goodwin, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jack Goldstone]] defines a revolution as
&lt;blockquote&gt;an effort to transform the political institutions and the justifications for political authority in society, accompanied by formal or informal mass mobilization and non-institutionalized actions that undermine authorities.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"&gt;Jack Goldstone, "Towards a Fourth Generation of Revolutionary Theory", ''[[Annual Review of Political Science]]'' 4, 2001:139-87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Political and socioeconomic revolutions have been studied in many [[social sciences]], particularly [[sociology]], [[political science]]s and [[history]]. Among the leading scholars in that area have been or are [[Crane Brinton]], [[Charles Brockett]], [[Farideh Farhi]], [[John Foran (sociologist)|John Foran]], [[John Mason Hart]], [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]], [[Jack Goldstone]], [[Jeff Goodwin]], [[Ted Roberts Gurr]], [[Fred Halliday]], [[Chalmers Johnson]], [[Tim McDaniel]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Jeffery Paige]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Terence Ranger]], [[Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy]], [[Theda Skocpol]], [[James C. Scott|James Scott]], [[Eric Selbin]], [[Charles Tilly]], [[Ellen Kay Trimberger]], [[Carlos Vistas]], [[John Walton (sociologist)|John Walton]], [[Timothy Wickham-Crowley]], and [[Eric Wolf]].&lt;ref name="NOWO:5"&gt;[[Jeff Goodwin]], ''No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991.'' Cambridge University Press, 2001, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of revolutions, like [[Jack Goldstone]], differentiate four current 'generations' of scholarly research dealing with revolutions.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt; The scholars of the first generation such as [[Gustave Le Bon]], [[Charles A. Ellwood]], or [[Pitirim Sorokin]], were mainly descriptive in their approach, and their explanations of the phenomena of revolutions was usually related to [[social psychology]], such as Le Bon's [[crowd psychology]] theory.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"/&gt;

Second generation theorists sought to develop detailed theories of why and when revolutions arise, grounded in more complex [[social behavior]] theories. They can be divided into three major approaches: psychological, sociological and political.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"/&gt;

The works of [[Ted Robert Gurr]], [[Ivo K. Feierbrand]], [[Rosalind L. Feierbrand]], [[James A. Geschwender]], [[David C. Schwartz]], and [[Denton E. Morrison]] fall into the first category. They followed theories of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[frustration-aggression theory]] and saw the cause of revolution in the state of mind of the masses, and while they varied in their approach as to what exactly caused the people to revolt (e.g., modernization, recession, or discrimination), they agreed that the primary cause for revolution was the widespread frustration with socio-political situation.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"/&gt;

The second group, composed of academics such as [[Chalmers Johnson]], [[Neil Smelser]], [[Bob Jessop]], [[Mark Hart]], [[Edward A. Tiryakian]], and [[Mark Hagopian]], followed in the footsteps of [[Talcott Parsons]] and the [[structural-functionalist]] theory in sociology; they saw society as a system in equilibrium between various resources, demands and subsystems (political, cultural, etc.). As in the psychological school, they differed in their definitions of what causes disequilibrium, but agreed that it is a state of a severe disequilibrium that is responsible for revolutions.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"/&gt;

Finally, the third group, which included writers such as [[Charles Tilly]], [[Samuel P. Huntington]], [[Peter Ammann]], and [[Arthur L. Stinchcombe]] followed the path of [[political sciences]] and looked at [[pluralist theory]] and [[interest group conflict theory]]. Those theories see events as outcomes of a [[power struggle]] between competing [[advocacy group|interest groups]]. In such a model, revolutions happen when two or more groups cannot come to terms within a normal [[decision making]] process traditional for a given [[political system]], and simultaneously have enough resources to employ force in pursuing their goals.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet3"/&gt;

The second generation theorists saw the development of the revolutions as a two-step process; first, some change results in the present situation being different from the past; second, the new situation creates an opportunity for a revolution to occur. In that situation, an event that in the past would not be sufficient to cause a revolution (e.g., a war, a riot, a bad harvest), now is sufficient; however, if authorities are aware of the danger, they can still prevent a revolution through reform or repression.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt;

Many such early studies of revolutions tended to concentrate on four classic cases: famous and uncontroversial examples that fit virtually all definitions of revolutions, such as the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688), the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799), the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], and the [[Chinese Civil War|Chinese Revolution (also known as the Chinese Civil War)]] (1927–1949).&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt; In his ''The Anatomy of Revolution'', however, the Harvard historian [[Crane Brinton]] focused on the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Crane Brinton, ''[[The Anatomy of Revolution]]'', revised ed. (New York, Vintage Books, 1965). First edition, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, scholars began to analyze hundreds of other events as revolutions (see [[List of revolutions and rebellions]]), and differences in definitions and approaches gave rise to new definitions and explanations. The theories of the second generation have been criticized for their limited geographical scope, difficulty in empirical verification, as well as that while they may explain some particular revolutions, they did not explain why revolutions did not occur in other societies in very similar situations.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt;

The criticism of the second generation led to the rise of a third generation of theories, with writers such as [[Theda Skocpol]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Jeffrey Paige]], and others expanding on the old [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[class conflict]] approach, turning their attention to rural agrarian-state conflicts, state conflicts with autonomous elites, and the impact of interstate economic and military competition on domestic political change Particularly Skocpol's ''[[States and Social Revolutions]]'' became one of the most widely recognized works of the third generation; Skocpol defined revolution as "rapid, basic transformations of society's state and class structures [...] accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below", attributing revolutions to a conjunction of multiple conflicts involving state, elites and the lower classes.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt;

[[File:West and East Germans at the Brandenburg Gate in 1989.jpg|thumb|left|The fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and most of the events of the [[Autumn of Nations]] in Europe, 1989, were sudden and peaceful.]]
From the late 1980s a new body of scholarly work began questioning the dominance of the third generation's theories. The old theories were also dealt a significant blow by new revolutionary events that could not be easily explain by them. The [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian]] and [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]s of 1979, the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] and the 1989 [[Autumn of Nations]] in Europe saw multi-class coalitions topple seemingly powerful regimes amidst popular demonstrations and [[General strike|mass strikes]] in [[nonviolent revolution]]s.

Defining revolutions as mostly European violent state versus people and [[class struggle]]s conflicts was no longer sufficient. The study of revolutions thus evolved in three directions, firstly, some researchers were applying previous or updated [[structuralism|structuralist]] theories of revolutions to events beyond the previously analyzed, mostly European conflicts. Secondly, scholars called for greater attention to conscious [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] in the form of ideology and culture in shaping revolutionary mobilization and objectives. Third, analysts of both revolutions and social movements realized that those phenomena have much in common, and a new 'fourth generation' literature on contentious politics has developed that attempts to combine insights from the study of social movements and revolutions in hopes of understanding both phenomena.&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt;

Further, social science research on revolution, primarily work in political science, has begun to move beyond individual or comparative case studies towards large-N empirical studies assessing the causes and implications of revolution. Initial studies generally rely on the Polity Project’s data on [[democratization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PolityProject|url = http://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html|website = www.systemicpeace.org|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such analyses, like those by Enterline,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Regime Changes, Neighborhoods, and Interstate Conflict, 1816-1992|url = http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/42/6/804|journal = Journal of Conflict Resolution|date = 1998-12-01|issn = 0022-0027|pages = 804–829|volume = 42|issue = 6|doi = 10.1177/0022002798042006006|language = en|first = A. J.|last = Enterline}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeev Maoz|Maoz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Domestic sources of global change|last = Maoz|first = Zeev|publisher = University of Michigan Press|year = 1996|isbn = |location = Ann Arbor, MI|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mansfield and Snyder,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Electing to Fight: Why Emerging Democracies go to War|last = Mansfield|first = Edward D.|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Snyder|first2 = Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; identify revolutions based on regime changes indicated by a change in the country’s score on Polity’s autocracy to democracy scale. More recently, scholars like Jeff Colgan have argued that Polity, which measures the degree of democratic or autocratic authority in a state's governing institutions based on the openness of executive recruitment, constraints on executive authority, and political competition, is inadequate because it measures democratization, not revolution, and fails to account for regimes which come to power by revolution but fail to change the structure of the state and society sufficiently to yield a notable difference in Polity score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measuring Revolution|url = http://cmp.sagepub.com/content/29/4/444|journal = Conflict Management and Peace Science|date = 2012-09-01|issn = 0738-8942|pages = 444–467|volume = 29|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/0738894212449093|language = en|first = Jeff|last = Colgan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Colgan offers a new data set on revolutionary leaders which identifies governments that "transform the existing social, political, and economic relationships of the state by overthrowing or rejecting the principal existing institutions of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Data - Jeff D Colgan|url = https://sites.google.com/site/jeffdcolgan/data|website = sites.google.com|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This most recent data set has been employed to make empirically-based contributions to the literature on revolution by identifying links between revolution and the likelihood of international disputes.

Revolutions have also been approached from anthropological perspectives. Drawing on Victor Turner’s writings on ritual and performance, [[Bjorn Thomassen]] has argued that revolutions can be understood as "liminal" moments: modern political revolutions very much resemble rituals and can therefore be studied within a process approach.&lt;ref name="Thomassen" /&gt; This would imply not only a focus on political behavior "from below", but also to recognize moments where "high and low" are relativized, made irrelevant or subverted, and where the micro and macro levels fuse together in critical conjunctions.

Economist [[Douglass North]] argued that it is much easier for revolutionaries to alter formal political institutions such as laws and constitutions than to alter informal social conventions. According to North, inconsistencies between rapidly changing formal institutions and slow-changing informal ones can inhibit effective sociopolitical change. Because of this, the long-term effect of revolutionary political restructuring is often more moderate than the ostensible short-term effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=North|first1=Douglass C|title=Transaction costs, institutions, and economic performance|date=1992|publisher=ICS Press|location=San Francisco|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While revolutions encompass events ranging from [[Revolutions of 1989|the relatively peaceful revolutions that overthrew communist regimes]] to the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|violent Islamic revolution in Afghanistan]], they exclude ''coups d'état'', civil wars, revolts, and rebellions that make no effort to transform institutions or the justification for authority (such as [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]] of 1926 or the [[American Civil War]]), as well as peaceful transitions to [[democracy]] through institutional arrangements such as [[plebiscite]]s and [[Election#Difficulties with elections|free elections]], as in [[Spain]] after the death of [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref name="Goldstonet4"/&gt;

[[File:Shuttle delivers ISS P1 truss.jpg|alt=|thumb|300x300px|A [[Space Shuttle]] in orbit around Earth]]
A '''spaceplane''' is an [[aerospace]] vehicle that operates as an [[aircraft]] in Earth's atmosphere, as well as a [[spacecraft]] when it is in [[Kármán line|space]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20141020-KC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/science/25-years-ago-nasa-envisioned-its-own-orient-express.html |title=25 Years Ago, NASA Envisioned Its Own ‘Orient Express’ |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |date=20 October 2014 |accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It combines features of an aircraft and a spacecraft, which can be thought of as an aircraft that can endure and maneuver in the vacuum of space or likewise a spacecraft that can fly like an airplane. Typically, it takes the form of a spacecraft equipped with [[wing]]s, although [[lifting body|lifting bodies]] have been designed and tested as well. The propulsion to reach space may be purely rocket based or may use the assistance of [[airbreathing jet engine]]s. The spaceflight is then followed by an unpowered [[glider (aircraft)|glide]] return to landing.

Five spaceplanes have successfully flown to date, having [[Atmospheric entry|reentered Earth's atmosphere]], [[Descent (aeronautics)|returned]] to [[Earth]], and [[Landing#Aircraft|safely landed]] — the [[North American X-15]], [[Space Shuttle]], [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]], [[SpaceShipOne]], and [[Boeing X-37]].  All five are considered rocket gliders. {{As of|2015}}, only these aircraft and [[rocket]]s have succeeded in reaching [[outer space|space]].  Two of these five (X-15 and SpaceShipOne) are [[rocket-powered aircraft]], having been carried up to an altitude of several tens of thousands of feet by an atmospheric [[mother ship]] before being released, and then flying beyond the [[Kármán line]], the boundary of Earth's atmosphere, under their own power.  Three (Space Shuttle, Buran, and X-37) are [[VTHL|vertical takeoff horizontal landing]] (VTHL) vehicles relying upon [[Launch vehicle|rocket lift]] for the ascent phase in reaching space and [[Lift (force)|atmospheric lift]] for [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]], [[Descent (aircraft)|descent]] and [[Landing#Aircraft|landing]]. The three VTHL spaceplanes flew much further than the aircraft launched ones, not merely leaving Earth's atmosphere but also entering orbit around it, which requires at least 50 times more energy on the way up and heavy heat shielding for the trip back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://archive.wired.com/science/space/magazine/15-06/ff_space_musk?currentPage=all |title=Betting on a Mission Beyond Earth's Orbit |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |first=Carl |last=Hoffman |issue=15.06 |date=22 May 2007 |accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the five vehicles, three have been piloted by astronauts, with the Buran and X-37 flying unmanned missions.

== Description ==
[[File:Atlantis is landing after STS-30 mission.jpg|thumb|Landing of [[NASA]]'s {{OV|104}}. The American Space Shuttle orbiters were manned orbital spaceplanes.]]
Significant features distinguish spaceplanes from [[spacecraft]].

=== Aerodynamic lift ===
{{Main|Lift (force)}}

All aircraft utilize [[wing|aerodynamic surface]]s in order to generate lift. For spaceplanes a variety of wing shapes can be used. [[Delta wing]]s are common, but straight wings, [[lifting body|lifting bodies]] and even [[rotorcraft]] have been proposed. Typically the force of lift generated by these surfaces is many times that of the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] that they induce.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

=== Atmospheric reentry ===
{{main|Atmospheric entry}}
Because [[suborbital spaceplane]]s are designed for trajectories that do not reach [[orbital speed]], they do not need the kinds of thermal protection orbital spacecraft required during the [[hypersonic]] phase of [[atmospheric reentry]]. The [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system]], for example, protects the orbiter from surface temperatures that could otherwise reach as high as {{convert|3000|F|C|order=flip}}, well above the melting point of steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/tps.htm |title=Orbiter Thermal Protection System |publisher=NASA/Kennedy Space Center |date=1989 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909094330/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/tps.htm |archivedate=9 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aircraft landing ===
{{main|Landing#Aircraft}}
A spaceplane operates as an [[aircraft]] in [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]].  Aircraft may land on firm [[runway]]s, [[helicopter landing pad]]s, or even [[water]] ([[amphibious aircraft]]), [[snow]] or [[ice]].  To land, the airspeed and the rate of [[Descent (aircraft)|descent]] are reduced such that the aircraft descends at a slow enough rate to allow for a gentle touch down. Landing is accomplished by slowing down and descending. This speed reduction is accomplished by reducing thrust and/or inducing a greater amount of drag using flaps, [[landing gear]] or [[Air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]].  [[Splashdown]] is an easier technical feat to accomplish, requiring only the deployment of a [[parachute]] (or parachutes), rather than successfully [[History of aviation#Heavier than air|aviating]] the [[atmosphere]].{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|1977|pp=xvi–xvii, 145–148, 171–173}} Project Gemini's original concept design was as a spaceplane, with paraglider and wheels (or skis) attached.  However, this concept was abandoned in favor of parachute splashdowns, because of expensive technical failures during testing and development.  Whereas Project Gemini's splashdown parachutes took only 5 months to develop in 1963, Gemini's spaceplane concept failed to materialize even after nearly 3 years of continued development.

=== Propulsion ===
[[File:Buran rear view (Le Bourget 1989).JPEG|thumb|upright|Buran orbiter rear showing rocket engine nozzles, for maneuvering in low Earth orbit and thin air]]

==== Rocket engines ====

All spaceplanes to date have used [[rocket engine]]s with chemical fuels.   As the [[orbital insertion]] burn has to be done in space, orbital spaceplanes require rocket engines for at least that portion of the flight.

==== Airbreathing engines ====
{{main|Airbreathing jet engine}}

A difference between rocket based and air-breathing aerospace plane launch systems is that aerospace plane designs typically include minimal [[oxidizer]] storage for propulsion.  Air-breathing aerospace plane designs include engine inlets so they can use atmospheric oxygen for [[combustion]].  Since the mass of the oxidizer is, at takeoff, the single largest mass of most rocket designs (the [[Space Shuttle]]'s [[Space Shuttle external tank#Technical specifications|liquid oxygen tank]] weighs 629,340&amp;nbsp;kg, more than one of its [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]]s), this provides a huge potential weight savings benefit. However, air breathing engines are usually very much heavier than rocket engines and the empty weight of the oxidizer tank, and since, unlike oxidizer, this extra weight (which is not expended to add kinetic energy to the vessel, as is propellant mass) must be carried into space it may offset the overall system performance.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Types of air breathing engines proposed for spaceplanes include [[scramjet]], [[liquid air cycle engine]]s, [[precooled jet engine]]s, [[pulse detonation engine]] and [[ramjet]]s. Some engine designs combine several types of engines features into a combined cycle. For instance, the [[Rocket-based combined cycle]] (RBCC) engine uses a rocket engine inside a ramscoop so that at low speed, the rockets thrust is boosted by ejector augmented thrust. It then transitions to ramjet propulsion at near-supersonic speeds, then to supersonic combustion or scramjet propulsion, above Mach 6, then back to pure rocket propulsion above Mach 10.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

=== Harsh flight environment ===
The flight trajectory required of air-breathing aerospace vehicles to reach orbit is to fly what is known as a 'depressed trajectory' which places the aerospace plane in the high-altitude hypersonic flight regime of the atmosphere.  This environment induces high dynamic pressure, high temperature, and high heat flow loads particularly upon the [[leading edge]] surfaces of the aerospace plane.  These loads typically require special advanced materials, [[active cooling]], or both, for the structures to survive the environment.

Rocket-powered spaceplanes also face a significant thermal environment if they are burning for orbit, but this is nevertheless far less severe than air-breathing spaceplanes.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Suborbital space planes designed to briefly reach space do not require significant thermal protection, as they experience peak heating for only a short time during re-entry. Intercontinental suborbital trajectories require much higher speeds and thermal protection more similar to orbital [[spacecraft reentry]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

=== Center of mass issues ===
A wingless launch vehicle has lower aerodynamic forces affecting the vehicle, and [[Flight dynamics|attitude control]] can be active perhaps with some fins to aid stability. For a winged vehicle the centre of lift moves during the atmospheric flight as well as the centre of mass; and the vehicle spends longer in the atmosphere as well. Historically, the [[X-33]] and [[HOTOL]] spaceplanes were rear engined and had relatively heavy engines. This puts a heavy mass at the rear of the aircraft with wings that had to hold up the vehicle. As the wet mass reduces, the centre of mass tends to move rearward behind the centre of lift, which tends to be around the centre of the wings. This can cause severe instability that is usually solved by extra fins which add weight and decrease performance.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

== Flown spaceplanes ==

The X-15 reached space in 1962/1963 ([[USAF]]/[[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] [[Kármán line]] classifications). SpaceShipOne was piloted by the first [[commercial astronaut]]. Both X-15 and SpaceShipOne [[Rocket-powered aircraft|ascend horizontally]] from a [[mother ship]]. Both Buran and X-37 spaceflights were [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned]].

=== Orbital spaceplanes ===
All three of the ''[[orbit]]al'' spaceplanes successfully flown to date utilize a [[VTHL]] (vertical takeoff, horizontal landing) design.  They include the piloted [[United States]] [[Space Shuttle]] and two unmanned spaceplanes:  the late-1980s [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Shuttle Buran|Buran]] and the early-2010s [[Boeing X-37]].

The early-1980s [[BOR-4]] (subscale test vehicle for the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105|Spiral spaceplane]] that was subsequently cancelled) was a [[spacecraft]] that did successfully [[Atmospheric entry|reenter the atmosphere]] and fly like an [[aircraft]].  But it was not designed to [[History of aviation#Sustaining the aircraft|sustain atmospheric flight]].  It was designed to stop flying, open a [[parachute]] and then [[Splashdown|splash in the ocean]].

These vehicles have used [[Airfoil|wings]] to provide [[aerobraking]] to return from orbit and to provide [[Lift (force)|lift]], allowing them to land on a [[runway]] like conventional aircraft. These vehicles are still designed to ascend to orbit vertically under [[rocket]] power like conventional [[expendable launch system|expendable launch vehicles]]. One drawback of spaceplanes is that they have a significantly smaller [[payload fraction]] than a ballistic design with the same takeoff weight. This is in part due to the weight of the wings — around 9–12% of the weight of the atmospheric flight weight of the vehicle. This significantly reduces the payload size, but the reusability is intended to offset this disadvantage.

While all spaceplanes have used [[Lift (force)|atmospheric lift]] for the [[Atmospheric entry|reentry phase]], none to date have succeeded in a design that relies on aerodynamic lift for the ascent phase in reaching space (excluding a [[mother ship]] first stage). Efforts such as the [[Silbervogel]] and [[X-30]]/[[X-33]] have all failed to materialize into a vehicle capable of successfully reaching space. The [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus]] winged booster has had many successful flights to deploy orbital payloads, but since its aerodynamic vehicle component operates only as a booster, and not operate in space as a spacecraft, it is not typically considered to be a spaceplane.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

On the other hand, [[OREX]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rocket.jaxa.jp/fstrc/0c01.html |title=OREX |publisher=Space Transportation System Research and Development Center, JAXA |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724064937/http://www.rocket.jaxa.jp/fstrc/0c01.html |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a test vehicle of [[HOPE-X]] and launched into 450&amp;nbsp;km LEO using [[H-II]] in 1994. OREX succeeded to reenter, but it was only hemispherical head of HOPE-X, that is, not plane-shaped.

=== Suborbital spaceplanes ===
[[File:X-15 flying.jpg|thumb|right|The X-15's rocket engine used ammonia and liquid oxygen.]]
{{main|Rocket-powered aircraft}}
Other spaceplane designs are [[suborbital spaceplane|suborbital]], requiring far less energy for propulsion, and can use the vehicle's wings to provide lift for the ''ascent to'' space in addition to the rocket. As of 2010, the only such craft to have successfully flown to and from [[space]], back to [[Earth]], have been the [[North American X-15]] and [[SpaceShipOne]]. Neither of these craft was capable of entering orbit. The X-15 and SpaceShipOne both began their independent flight only after being lifted to high altitude by a carrier aircraft.

== Proposed spaceplanes ==
[[File:Gemini paraglider.JPG|thumb|right|United States [[Project Gemini#Spacecraft|Gemini]] spaceplane concept testing, August 1964]]

Various types of spaceplanes have been suggested since the early twentieth century. Notable early designs include [[Friedrich Zander]]'s spaceplane equipped with wings made of combustible alloys that it would burn during its ascent, and [[Eugen Sänger]]'s [[Silbervogel]] [[bomber aircraft|bomber]] design. Also in Germany and then in the US, winged versions of the [[V-2]] rocket were considered during and after [[World War II]], and when public interest in space exploration was high in the 1950s and '60s, winged rocket designs by [[Wernher von Braun]] and [[Willy Ley]] served to inspire [[science fiction]] artists and filmmakers.

=== United States ===
The [[U.S. Air Force]] invested some effort in a paper study of a variety of spaceplane projects under their [[Aerospaceplane]] efforts of the late 1950s, but later ended these when they decided to use a modified version of Sänger's design. The result, [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]], was to have been the first orbital spaceplane, but was canceled in the early 1960s in lieu of [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]] and the U.S. Air Force's [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] program.

In 1961, NASA originally planned to have the [[Project Gemini#Spacecraft|Gemini spacecraft]] land on a firm, solid ground [[runway]]{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|1977|pp=xvi–xvii}} with a [[Rogallo wing]] [[airfoil]], rather than as a [[splashdown]] with [[parachute]].&lt;ref name="Gem"&gt;Please refer to [[Project Gemini#Spacecraft]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The test vehicle became known as the [[NASA Paresev|Paraglider Research Vehicle]]. Development work on both [[Project Gemini#Spacecraft|Gemini]]'s [[splashdown]] [[parachute]] and spaceplane [[NASA Paresev|paraglider]] began in 1963.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|1977|pp=145–148}}  By December 1963, the [[parachute]] was already to undergo full-scale deployment testing.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|1977|pp=145–148}}  On the other hand, by December 1963 the paraglider spaceplane concept was running into technical difficulties{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|1977|pp=xvi–xvii}} and subsequently became replaced by the parachute splashdown concept.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|1977|pp=145–148}}  Though attempts to revive [[Project Gemini#Spacecraft|Gemini]]'s paraglider spaceplane concept persisted within NASA and [[North American Aviation]] as late as 1964,{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|1977|pp=171–173}} NASA Headquarters Gemini Chief William Schneider discontinued development as technical hurdles became too expensive.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|1977|pp=171–173}}

[[File:Space Shuttle concepts.jpg|thumb|right|United States STS concepts, circa 1970s]]
[[File:X-30 futuristic nasa.jpg|thumb|Illustration of NASP taking off]]
The [[Rockwell X-30]] National Aero-Space Plane (NASP), begun in the 1980s, was an attempt to build a scramjet vehicle capable of operating like an aircraft and achieving orbit like the shuttle. President [[Ronald Reagan]] described NASP in his 1986 [[State of the Union]] address as "...a new Orient Express that could, by the end of the next decade, take off from Dulles Airport and accelerate up to twenty-five times the speed of sound, attaining low Earth orbit or flying to Tokyo within two hours..."&lt;ref name="FAS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/mystery/nasp.htm |title=X-30 National Aerospace Plane (NASP) |work=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |accessdate=30 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421135746/http://www.fas.org/irp/mystery/nasp.htm |archivedate=21 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There were six identifiable technologies which were considered critical to the success of the NASP project.  Three of these "enabling" technologies were related to the propulsion system, which would consist of a hydrogen-fueled scramjet.&lt;ref name="FAS" /&gt; 

The NASP program became the Hypersonic Systems Technology Program (HySTP) in late 1994. HySTP was designed to transfer the accomplishments made in hypersonic technologies by the National Aero-Space Plane (NASP) program into a technology development program. On 27 January 1995 the Air Force terminated participation in (HySTP).&lt;ref name="FAS" /&gt; It was canceled due to increasing technical challenges, and growing budgets.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In 1994 Mitchell Burnside Clapp proposed a single stage to orbit peroxide/kerosene spaceplane called "[[Black Horse (spaceplane)|Black Horse]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/blahorse.htm |title=Black Horse |website=Astronautix.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722112056/http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/blahorse.htm |archivedate=22 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to take off almost empty and undergo [[Aerial refueling|mid-air refueling]] before launching to orbit.&lt;ref name=zubrin&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.risacher.org/bh/analog.html |title=Black Horse: One Stop to Orbit |magazine=[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]] |first1=Robert M. |last1=Zubrin |first2=Mitchell Burnside |last2=Clapp |volume=115 |issue=7 |date=June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lockheed Martin X-33]] was a 1/3 scale prototype made as part of an attempt by NASA to build a SSTO hydrogen-fuelled spaceplane [[VentureStar]] that failed when the hydrogen tank design proved to be unconstructable in the planned way. 

The edition of 5 March 2006 of [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]] published a story purporting to be "outing" a highly classified U.S. military two-stage-to-orbit spaceplane system with the code name [[Blackstar (spaceplane)|Blackstar]], [[SR-3/XOV]] among other nicknames.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

[[File:Boeing X-37B inside payload fairing before launch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Boeing X-37B]] being prepared for launch in 2010 on an expendable orbital rocket]]

In 1999 NASA started the [[Boeing X-37]] project, an unmanned, remote controlled spaceplane. The project was transferred to the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] in 2004.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Boeing has proposed that a larger variant of the X-37B, the X-37C could be built to carry up to six passengers up to [[low-Earth orbit|LEO]].  The spaceplane would also be usable for carrying cargo, with both [[upmass]] and [[downmass]] (return to Earth) cargo capacity.  The ideal size for the proposed derivative "is approximately 165 to 180 percent of the current X-37B."&lt;ref name=sdc20111007&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/13230-secretive-37b-space-plane-future-astronauts.html |title=Secretive US X-37B Space Plane Could Evolve to Carry Astronauts |work=Space.com |first=David |last=Leonard |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, [[Orbital Sciences]] made a commercial proposal to NASA to develop the [[Prometheus (spacecraft)|Prometheus]], a [[lifting body|lifting-body]] spaceplane vehicle about one-quarter the size of the [[Space Shuttle]], in response to NASA's [[Commercial Crew Development]] (CCDev) {{nowrap|phase 2}} solicitation.

It was never constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/MUSTARD.html |title=MUSTARD (Multi-Unit Space Transport and Recovery Device) |first=David |last=Darling |date=2010 |accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Government also began development of a SSTO-spaceplane, called [[HOTOL]], but the project was canceled due to technical and financial issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/bkgrnd.html |title=HOTOL History |publisher=Reaction Engines Limited |date=2010 |accessdate=29 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808065903/http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/bkgrnd.html |archivedate=8 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lead engineer from the HOTOL project has since set up a private company dedicated to creating a similar plane called [[Reaction Engines Skylon|Skylon]] with a different combined cycle rocket/turbine [[precooled jet engine]] called [[Reaction Engines SABRE|SABRE]]. This vehicle is intended to be capable of a single stage to orbit launch carrying a {{convert|15000|kg|abbr=on}} payload into [[low Earth orbit]]. If successful it would be far in advance of anything currently in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/faq.html#q6 |title=Skylon FAQ |publisher=Reaction Engines Limited |date=2010 |accessdate=29 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602004107/http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/faq.html#q6 |archivedate=2 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British company [[Bristol Spaceplanes]] has undertaken design and prototyping of three potential spaceplanes since its founding by David Ashford in 1991. The [[European Space Agency]] has endorsed these designs on several occasions.&lt;ref name="BSPcompanyinfo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bristolspaceplanes.com/company/ |title=Bristol Spaceplanes Company Information |publisher=Bristol Spaceplanes |date=2014 |accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France and the European Space Agency ===
[[France]] worked on the [[Hermes (spaceplane)|Hermes]] manned spaceplane launched by [[Ariane rocket]] in the late 20th century, and proposed in January 1985 to go through with Hermes development under the auspices of the ESA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hermes: Learning from our mistakes |journal=Space Policy |first=Martin |last=Bayer |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=171–180 |date=August 1995 |doi=10.1016/0265-9646(95)00016-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hopper (spacecraft)|Hopper]] was one of several proposals for a European reusable launch vehicle (RLV) planned to cheaply ferry satellites into orbit by 2015.&lt;ref name="NewScientist" &gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4975-europes-space-shuttle-passes-early-test/ |title=Europe's space shuttle passes early test |work=New Scientist |first=Maggie |last=McKee |date=10 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of those was 'Phoenix', a German project which is a one-seventh scale model of the Hopper concept vehicle.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3699848.stm |title=Launching the next generation of rockets |work=BBC News |date=1 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suborbital Hopper was a [[FESTIP]] (Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme) system  study design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet97/dujarric.pdf |title=Possible Future European Launchers, A Process of Convergence |journal=ESA Bulletin |publisher=European Space Agency |first=C. |last=Dujarric |issue=97 |pages=11–19 |date=March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A test project, the [[Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle]] (IXV), has demonstrated lifting reentry technologies and will be extended under the [[Programme for Reusable In-orbit Demonstrator in Europe|PRIDE programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/5978-europe-aims-entry-spacecraft.html |title=Europe Aims For Re-entry Spacecraft |work=Space.com |first=Jeremy |last=Hsu |date=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
'''[[HOPE-X|HOPE]]''' was a [[Japan]]ese experimental spaceplane project designed by a partnership between [[National Space Development Agency of Japan|NASDA]] and [[National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan|NAL]] (both now part of [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]]), started in the 1980s. It was positioned for most of its lifetime as one of the main Japanese contributions to the [[International Space Station]], the other being the [[Japanese Experiment Module]]. The project was eventually cancelled in 2003, by which point test flights of a sub-scale testbed had flown successfully.

=== Germany ===
After the [[Germany|German]] Sänger-Bredt RaBo and [[Silbervogel]] of the 1930s and 1940s, [[Eugen Sänger]] worked for time on various space plane projects, coming up with several designs for [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm]] such as the MBB Raumtransporter-8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/s/saengeri.html |title=Saenger I |website=Astronautix.com |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, West Germany funded design work on the [[Saenger (spacecraft)|MBB Sänger II]] with the Hypersonic Technology Program. Development continued on MBB/Deutsche Aerospace Sänger II/HORUS until the late 1980s when it was canceled. Germany went on to participate in the Ariane rocket, Columbus space station and Hermes spaceplane of [[ESA]], [[Spacelab]] of ESA-NASA and ''Deutschland'' missions (non-U.S. funded Space Shuttle flights with Spacelab). The Sänger II had predicted cost savings of up to 30 percent over expendable rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/s/saengerii.html |title=Saenger II |website=Astronautix.com |accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/spp/guide/germany/piloted/index.html |title=Germany and Piloted Space Missions |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |series=Space Policy Project |accessdate=26 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124617/http://fas.org/spp/guide/germany/piloted/index.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Daimler-Chrysler Aerospace RLV was a much later small reusable spaceplane prototype for ESA [[Future Launchers Preparatory Programme]]/FLTP program.
Most recent project is [[SpaceLiner]].

{{As of|2016}}, the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] is developing a launch system named the [[RLV Technology Demonstration Programme|Reusable Launch Vehicle]] (RLV). It is India's first step towards realizing a [[two-stage-to-orbit]] [[reusable launch system]]. A space plane serves as the second stage. The plane is expected to have air-breathing [[scramjet]] engines as well as rocket engines. Tests with miniature spaceplanes and a working scramjet have been conducted by ISRO in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.isro.gov.in/update/23-may-2016/india%E2%80%99s-reusable-launch-vehicle-technology-demonstrator-rlv-td-successfully |title=India's Reusable Launch Vehicle-Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD), Successfully Flight Tested |publisher=Indian Space Research Organisation |date=23 May 2016 |access-date=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''supercentenarian'' has been in existence since at least the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date= 15 November 1870|title= Death of a Super-centenarian|url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/61101720/?terms=supercentenarian|newspaper= The Tralee Chronicle and Killarney Echo |access-date= 5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date= 10 October 1897|title= The Doctors and the Microbes|url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/33861951/?image=33861951&amp;words=&amp;terms=supercentenarian|newspaper= The Inter Ocean |access-date= 5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''ultracentenarian'' has also been used to describe someone well over 100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gibb|first=G.|date=1876|title=Ultra-Centenarian Longevity|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2841365?sid=21105799984093&amp;uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4|journal=The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|volume=5|pages=82–101|access-date=6 February 2015|doi=10.2307/2841365}}&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Norris McWhirter]], editor of ''[[Guinness World Records|The Guinness Book of Records]]'', used the word in correspondence with age claims researcher [[A. Ross Eckler Jr.]] in 1976, and it was further popularised in 1991 by [[William Strauss]] and [[Neil Howe]] in their book ''[[Generations (book)|Generations]]''.  Meanwhile, ''semisupercentenarian'' has been used for the age range of 105–109 years.&lt;ref name=JGA/&gt; Early references to ''supercentenarian'' tend to mean simply "someone well over 100", but the 110-and-over cutoff is the accepted criterion of [[demography|demographers]].

While [[longevity claims|claims of extreme age]] have persisted from the earliest times in history, the earliest supercentenarian accepted by [[Guinness World Records]] is [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] Thomas Peters (reportedly 1745–1857).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Scholars such as French demographer [[Jean-Marie Robine]], however, consider [[Geert Adriaans Boomgaard]], also of the Netherlands, who turned 110 in 1898, to be the first verifiable case, as the alleged evidence for Peters has apparently been lost. The evidence for the 112 years of Englishman [[William Hiseland]] (reportedly 1620–1733) does not meet the standards required by Guinness World Records. [[Norway|Norwegian]] Church records, the accuracy of which is subject to dispute, also show what appear to be several supercentenarians who lived in the south-central part of present-day [[Norway]] during the 16th and 17th centuries, including Johannes Torpe (1549–1664), and Knud Erlandson Etun (1659–1770), both residents of [[Valdres]], [[Oppland]], [[Norway]].

In 1902, [[Margaret Ann Neve]], born in 1792, became the first verified female supercentenarian. [[Jeanne Calment]] of [[France]], who died in 1997 aged 122 years, 164 days, had the longest human lifespan documented. The oldest man ever verified is [[Jiroemon Kimura]] of [[Japan]], who died in 2013 aged 116 years and 54 days.

Over 1,500 supercentenarians have been documented in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grg.org/Adams/b.HTM Gerontology Research Group: Verified Supercentenarians (Ranked By Age) as of January 1, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that more have lived, but the majority of claims to have lived to this age do not have sufficient documentary support to be validated. This is slowly changing as those born after birth registration was standardized in more countries and localities attain supercentenarian age.

==Morbidity==
Research on the [[morbidity]] of supercentenarians has found that they remain free of major age-related diseases (e.g., [[stroke]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[dementia]], [[cancer]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[diabetes]]) until the very end of life when they die of exhaustion of organ reserve, which is the ability to return organ function to [[Human homeostasis|homeostasis]].&lt;ref name=JGA&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Stacy L. |last2=Sebastiani |first2=Paola |last3=Dworkis |first3=Daniel A. |last4=Feldman |first4=Lori |last5=Perls |first5=Thomas T. |title=Health Span Approximates Life Span Among Many Supercentenarians: Compression of Morbidity at the Approximate Limit of Life Span |journal=The Journals of Gerontology: Series A |date=2012 |volume=67A |pages=395–405 |doi=10.1093/gerona/glr223 |url=http://biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/67A/4/395.full |accessdate=28 February 2014|pmc=3309876 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 10% of supercentenarians survive until the last 3 months of life without major age-related diseases, as compared to only 4% of semisupercentenarians and 3% of centenarians.&lt;ref name=JGA/&gt;

By measuring the biological age of various tissues from supercentenarians, researchers may be able to identify the nature of those that are protected from aging effects. According to a study of 30 different body parts from a 112-year-old female supercentenarian, along with younger controls, the [[cerebellum]] is protected from aging according to an [[epigenetic]] biomarker of tissue age known as the [[Biological clock (aging)|epigenetic clock]] — the reading is about 15 years younger than expected in a centenarian.&lt;ref name="Horvath2015cerebellum"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = The cerebellum ages slowly according to the epigenetic clock. | journal = [[Age (Albany US)]]| volume = 7 | year = 2015| url = http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v7/n5/pdf/100742.pdf | pmid = 26000617  |pmc= 4468311|vauthors=Horvath S, Mah V, Lu AT, Woo JS, Choi OW, Jasinska AJ, Riancho JA, Tung S, Coles NS, Braun J, Vinters HV, Coles LS | issue = 5 | doi=10.18632/aging.100742 | pages=294–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings could explain why the cerebellum exhibits fewer neuropathological hallmarks of age-related dementia as compared to other brain regions.

[[File:Bar Council Malaysia Teoh Beng Hock dalam kenangan.JPG|thumb|right|Bar Council of Malaysia (headquarters in Kuala Lumpur) showing a banner 'Teoh Beng Hock dalam kenangan' (Teoh Beng Hock in memoriam).]]
'''Teoh Beng Hock''' (20 April 1979 – 1 July 2009) was a Malaysian journalist and political aide to [[Ean Yong Hian Wah]], a member of the [[Selangor]] state legislative assembly and state executive council. On 1 July 2009, the [[Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission]] (MACC) took Teoh into custody for questioning about allegations of corruption. Teoh was found dead the next morning on the rooftop of a building adjacent to the MACC offices. [[Pakatan Rakyat]] leaders and a number of federal government officials have called for a Royal Commission of inquiry into Teoh's death.&lt;ref name="mmail"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ayu |last=Musa Kamal |author2=Muzliza Mustafa |author3=Pearl Lee |author4=Teoh El Sen |author5=Aizat Sharif |title=DEATH OF TEOH BENG HOCK: A mystery waiting to be solved |date=17 July 2009 |url=http://mmail.com.my/content/8388-death-teoh-beng-hock-mystery-waiting-be-solved |work=The Malay Mail |accessdate=20 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720193218/http://www.mmail.com.my/content/8388-death-teoh-beng-hock-mystery-waiting-be-solved |archivedate=20 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Teoh was the third child of Teoh Leong Hwee (born 1953). He had an elder brother; Teoh Beng Kee (''Chinese'': 赵铭基) (born 1976), elder sister; Teoh Lee Jun (''Chinese:'' 赵丽君) and a younger sister; Teoh Lee Lan (1980，''Chinese:'' 赵丽兰). His father was a taxi driver, and his mother, Teng Shuw Hor (1953) is a housewife.

Teoh was engaged to 28-year-old teacher Soh Cher Wei after a two-year courtship, and had been planning to register his marriage with her the day following his death. A photo shoot on the same day, followed by a honeymoon and wedding reception in October had also been planned. At the time of Teoh's death, Soh was two months pregnant; she told the press she intended to keep the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mazlinda |last=Mahmood |title=Teoh's fiancee to keep baby |date=18 July 2009 |url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/articles/20090718013141/Article/index_html |work=The New Straits Times |accessdate=22 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722140959/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/articles/20090718013141/Article/index_html |archivedate=22 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; National Registration Department regulations only allow a father's name to be included on the [[birth certificate]] if he is physically present at the time of birth; after this was publicised through the press, Women, Family and Community Development Minister [[Shahrizat Abdul Jalil]] said she would ask the NRD to look into the matter. Shahrizat also stated her ministry would assist in transferring Soh from her current school to one closer to her hometown, and look into assisting Teoh's family since he was their sole breadwinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Ministry to look into welfare of Teoh's family | date=22 July 2009 | url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/7/22/nation/4365323&amp;sec=nation | work=The Star | accessdate=22 July 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723112047/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2009%2F7%2F22%2Fnation%2F4365323&amp;sec=nation | archivedate=23 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[Najib Tun Razak]] later met with Teoh's family to express his condolences. Najib told them he would direct the Attorney-General and relevant government departments to look into Teoh's family's wish that his child bear the Teoh surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Najib meets the Teohs | date=28 July 2009 | url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/33587-najib-meets-the-teohs | work=The Malaysian Insider | accessdate=28 July 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731104527/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/33587-najib-meets-the-teohs | archivedate=31 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August 2009, Soh completed the traditional Chinese marriage ceremonies, together with Teoh Lee Lan, Beng Hock's younger sister, acting as a proxy. [[Kerk Kim Hock]], a distant uncle of Teoh and the family's acting spokesperson, told the press that completion of the marriage rites now entitled Soh to have her name engraved on Teoh's gravestone as his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Debra | last=Chong | title=The bride wore black | date=15 August 2009 | url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/35250-the-bride-wore-black | work=The Malaysian Insider | accessdate=15 August 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816205930/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/35250-the-bride-wore-black | archivedate=16 August 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sequence of events ==

MACC officials claimed that the interrogation had lasted for about 9 hours. According to the MACC also, Teoh was freed at 3.45{{nbsp}}am—however without proper explanation, his possessions, including his mobile phone, remained in MACC custody. MACC officials also claimed that Teoh asked to stay the night at the MACC office, and was claimed to be last seen alive around 6{{nbsp}}am. Teoh was found dead at 1.30{{nbsp}}pm later in the day. The investigation had been into allegations that Ean Yong had paid RM2,400 for flags to be used in [[Merdeka Day]] celebrations, but not taken delivery of the flags. Teoh's colleagues who had also been questioned claimed that they were put under pressure from MACC officers, including being denied access to legal counsel and food or drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Tricia | last=Yeoh |title='Who will fall prey next?' | date=17 July 2009 | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/108814 | work =Malaysiakini | accessdate = 20 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teoh's mobile phone was still in the possession of MACC officials when he was found dead at 1.30{{nbsp}}pm despite the MACC's claims that Teoh was released at 3.45{{nbsp}}am. The mobile phone was later handed to the police for investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=21 July 2009| url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/32939-cops-step-up-probe-into-teohs-death-| title=Cops step up probe into Teoh's death| publisher=Malaysian Insider| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722225816/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/32939-cops-step-up-probe-into-teohs-death-| archivedate=22 July 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Teoh's colleagues, Tan Boon Wah, later filed suit against the MACC for [[false imprisonment]]. In the case, ''[[Tan Boon Wah v. Datuk Seri Ahmad Said Hamdan, Ketua Suruhanjaya, Suruhanjaya Pencegahan Rasuah Malaysia and Others]]'', the [[courts of Malaysia|High Court]] ruled that because Tan was interrogated after normal [[working hours]], he had been subject to false imprisonment, and ordered the MACC to pay him [[damages]]. Tan's lawyer, [[Karpal Singh]], said that Teoh's family could also sue the MACC for damages, citing this ruling. [[Democratic Action Party]] Parliamentary leader and former Opposition Leader [[Lim Kit Siang]] lamented that "Teoh Beng Hock would not have died if MACC had followed the law" and interrogated him during the day.&lt;ref name='high court TMI'&gt;{{cite news | first=Debra | last=Chong | title=MACC can't quiz witnesses beyond office hours, High Court rules | date=19 November 2009 | url=http://themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/43944-macc-cant-quiz-witnesses-beyond-office-hours-high-court-rules | work=The Malaysian Insider | accessdate=19 November 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120053128/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/43944-macc-cant-quiz-witnesses-beyond-office-hours-high-court-rules | archivedate=20 November 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teoh's family and others have called the MACC's version of events into question. When the investigating officer involved briefed the MACC's advisory board, several members of the board "asked why he chose to stay back. Any detainee would have run for his life! The investigating officer replied that since Teoh wanted to stay back, he allowed it." During this briefing it also emerged that no official records of Teoh's detention or his release existed.&lt;ref name="in-out record"&gt;{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Ong |title='No in-out record', MACC advisor raises eyebrows | date=1 August 2009 | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/109712 | work =Malaysiakini | accessdate = 3 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, a video of men in uniform assaulting a man in their custody began circulating as a supposed video of Teoh's interrogation. The Bukit Aman federal police headquarters denied the men were police personnel. The video had previously been circulated in June as a supposed example of police interrogation techniques, ruling out the possibility of it involving Teoh. A political observer attributed the video's popularity to the government's failing to provide adequate clarification about the circumstances of Teoh's interrogation: "The authorities are shedding little light about what happened to Teoh. This allows rumour mongers to spread ridiculous things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Ong |title=Assault video linked to Teoh sparks frenzy | date=4 August 2009 | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/109882 | work =Malaysiakini | accessdate = 4 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response to death ==

Some lawyers have argued that the law does not authorise the MACC to hold witnesses in custody, and that since Teoh was not a suspect, he should not have been held in custody. The [[Human Rights Commission of Malaysia|Malaysian Human Rights Commission]] called the duration of Teoh's questioning "inhumane and cruel."&lt;ref name="mmail"/&gt; The president of the Bar Council, K. Ragunath, said the MACC had contravened the Federal Constitution by denying Teoh legal counsel during questioning, as well as the Lockup Rules 1953, which require all detainees to be locked up between 6.30{{nbsp}}pm and 6.30{{nbsp}}am to rest. Ragunath called Teoh's interrogation tantamount to torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Teoh 'the first political death' under Najib | date=18 July 2009 | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/108784 | work =Malaysiakini | accessdate = 20 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ean Yong's lawyer insisted that as "Teoh's movement was restricted, this amounts to an arrest," despite the MACC's insistence that Teoh was only a voluntary witness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Neville | last=Spykerman | title=Ean Yong: Teoh was arrested | date=22 July 2009 | url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/33061-ean-yong-teoh-was-arrested | work=The Malaysian Insider | accessdate=22 July 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723215242/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/33061-ean-yong-teoh-was-arrested | archivedate=23 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohamad Ramli Manan, a senior official who retired from the Anti-Corruption Agency (before it became the MACC), agreed:

{{cquote|It is against established law and practice to interrogate them (suspects) in the night. The lock-up rules demand that they be sent to a lock-up by at least 8{{nbsp}}pm... Witnesses are sent back to their offices or homes and asked to be present at another appointed date. I don't know why they had to call Teoh at 5{{nbsp}}pm. This may be due to poor planning or some evil intention or evil purpose on their part. ... The rights of a witness are protected more than that of a suspect, who is under detention...the person can demand that the interview be adjourned to the next morning. ... The examining officer has to oblige, failing which this becomes an (unlawful) detention or arrest. ... This shows that Teoh was definitely in the custody of the MACC. Under Section 15 of the Criminal Procedure Code, an arrest occurs when you confine the person (physically). Thus, there was unlawful detention or arrest of Teoh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Kuang Keng | last=Kuek Ser | title=Former ACA official: Teoh held unlawfully | date=28 July 2009 | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/109427 | work =Malaysiakini | accessdate = 28 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another former ACA official, Abdul Razak Idris, disputed Ramli's view of the interrogation process, saying: "The Act provides that we can interview anytime. Investigators are supposed to work 24 hours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ai Tsin | last=Yip |title=Ex-ACA top gun: Stop showering criticism on MACC | date=31 July 2009 | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/109667 | work =Malaysiakini | accessdate = 31 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to calls from civil society and political leaders for a Royal Commission, Deputy Prime Minister [[Muhyiddin Yassin]] stated the Cabinet would consider setting up a Royal Commission of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Muhyiddin: Cabinet to consider setting up royal panel | date=18 July 2009 | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/108777 | work =Malaysiakini | accessdate = 20 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial police findings suggested foul play was not involved in Teoh's death, but his friends and relatives insisted Teoh had not committed suicide, pointing to the fact that he was to be married, and that his fiance was pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Cops rule out foul play, friends rule out suicide | date=17 July 2009 | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/108753 | work =Malaysiakini | accessdate = 20 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teoh's family lawyers claimed that during questioning by the police, his family had been asked questions suggesting that they were primarily interested in "[absolving] MACC officers from liability" by pursuing the possibility of a suicide. A week after Teoh's death, his family vigorously insisted there was no possibility he had killed himself: "Teoh was joyful and had no problems at work. Teoh had no financial issues, got along well with everyone and was preparing for his wedding." One detail which seemed to strike the police was Teoh's shoes; when his body was discovered, his shoes were apparently significantly damaged and worn. Teoh's fiancee "said that Teoh had several pairs and seldom changed them unless they were damaged, but on that fateful day, he wore a new pair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Rahmah | last=Ghazali |title='Police tried absolve MACC officers from liability' | date=22 July 2009 | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/109077 | work =Malaysiakini | accessdate = 22 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO)-owned newspaper [[Berita Harian]] published an op-ed by [[New Straits Times Press]] managing editor Zainul Ariffin Isa criticising the response to Teoh's death, stating that criticisms of the MACC were an attempt to undermine Malay institutions. Zainul was particularly critical of Selangor Menteri Besar [[Khalid Ibrahim]] for his criticism of the MACC officers' handling of the case, saying it was not right for Khalid to question "those of the same race as him."&lt;ref name="suspension"&gt;{{cite news | title=Cabinet orders suspension of MACC officers | date=22 July 2009 | url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/33025-cabinet-orders-suspension-of-macc-officers | work=The Malaysian Insider | accessdate=22 July 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723084258/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/33025-cabinet-orders-suspension-of-macc-officers | archivedate=23 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the weekly Malaysian Cabinet meeting on 22 July following Teoh's death, the Cabinet transferred all MACC officers involved in the probe of graft allegations against the Selangor government to other assignments, pending the official police inquiry.&lt;ref name="suspension"/&gt; The Cabinet also decided to establish a Royal Commission of inquiry into the MACC's interrogation procedures, but not Teoh's death, allowing the standard [[inquest]] to pursue the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Cabinet approves royal commission | date=22 July 2009 | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/109051 | work =Malaysiakini | accessdate = 22 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Royal commission of inquiry ===

In a joint statement, Pakatan Rakyat leaders called the Royal Commission's terms of reference insufficient, saying that the "question [of how Teoh died] cannot be separated from the more general issue of how the MACC conducts investigations."&lt;ref name="pr_statement"&gt;{{cite news | title=Pakatan wants more from royal commission | date=23 July 2009 | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/109099 | work =Malaysiakini | accessdate = 23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pakatan Rakyat statement insisted that the Commission probe the following questions:
{{cquote|
*why was Teoh's case allegedly involving an amount less than RM2,500 is [sic] pursued with such aggression and urgency?
*why was Teoh and another so-called "witness" kept overnight and interrogated with such oppression?
*why was Teoh's hand phone in the custody of the MACC when the MACC insisted that he was only a witness; why did the MACC initially deny they took his handphone?
*why would Teoh spend the night at the MACC's office if he was free to go especially since he was scheduled to be married the next morning?

{{Translation sidebar}}
Like any supplier of goods or [[Service (economics)|service]]s, a [[translation|translator]] potentially bears [[ethical]] and  [[legal]] obligations toward his [[patron]] or [[employer]]. This has turned to be of enormous importance with the development of the [[language industry]] at global scale. For the protection of both parties, [[Technical standard|standards]] have been developed that seek to spell out their mutual [[duties]].

==History==
Standards of [[Quality (business)|quality]] and [[documentation]] were originally developed for [[manufacturing]] [[business]]es. [[Code]]s for all types of [[Service (economics)|service]]s are now maintained by standardization organizations such as the [[International Organization for Standardization]].  Standards of this type include those of the [[ISO 9000]] series.

As interest in [[quality management]] has grown, specific [[quality standard]]s have been developed for [[translation]] services.  These have included the [[Italy|Italian]] UNI 10574, the [[Germany|German]] DIN 2345, the [[Austria]]n Önorm D 1200 and Önorm D 1201,  and the [[Canada|Canadian]] CAN CGSB 131.10.

In 2015,  EN 15038 was replaced by [[ISO 17100:2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59149|title=ISO 17100:2015 - Translation services -- Requirements for translation services|website=ISO|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EN 15038==
The [[Europe]]an [[EN 15038]] translation-services standard went into effect on August 1, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;''EN 15038: European Quality Standard for Translation Services, Language Weaver News, Volume 3, Issue 7, July 2007''&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the previous standards of the 30 individual [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] member countries.  It aims to unify the [[terminology]] used in the [[translation]] field, define basic requirements for [[language]]-[[Service (economics)|service]] providers ([[human]] and [[Technology|technical]] resources, [[quality control]], and [[project management]]) and create a framework for the interaction of [[customer]]s and [[service provider]]s in terms of their [[rights]] and [[obligation]]s.  It also defines certain  services, in addition to translation, that may be offered by language-service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Which Translation Services Certification is Right in Canada - ISO 17100 or CGSB131.10|url=https://www.languagemarketplace.ca/Info-factors-which-translation-standard.html#.VyYPJb8TWqw|accessdate=1 May 2016|work=languagemarketplace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong focus is on [[Administration of business|administrative]], [[documentation]], [[review]] and [[revision control|revision]] processes, as well as on the functions of different specialists who guide the [[translation project]] over its duration.  [[Addendum|Appendices]] to the [[Technical standard|standard]] provide information and suggestions on how best to comply with the standard.

==CAN CGSB 131.10-2008==
On May 12, 2009, the '''Language Industry Association of Canada''', [http://www.ailia.ca AILIA] launched the latest standards certification program in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ailia.ca/content.php?doc%3D52 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725082025/http://www.ailia.ca/content.php?doc=52 |archivedate=July 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The certification is based on [http://www.ailia.ca/Certification+Preparation+Guide+CAN+CGSB CAN/CGSB-131.10-2008], Translation Services, a national standard developed by the Canadian General Standards Board and approved by the Standards Council of Canada.  It involved the participation of representatives from AILIA, professional associations, government, academia, purchasers of service, and other stakeholders.
 
The '''Canadian Standard for Translation Services CAN CGSB 131.10 - 2008''' establishes and defines the requirements for the provision of translation services by translation service providers.

This National Standard of Canada is a modified adoption of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) standard EN 15038 Translation Services. This document was prepared with the intent to harmonize where possible with the provisions of EN 15038 Translation Services. Variances in wording and content with EN 15038 reflect the Canadian perspective.

Conformity assessment and certification based on this standard are already in place. With the recent development of national and regional standards for translation services, many translation service providers, nationally and internationally, are now in the process of either considering or seeking certification of the services they provide in meeting the demands of the marketplace.

The standard specifies the requirements for the provision of translation services by the translation service provider (TSP).

There are three key points common to all standards:
* Select your human resources with care.
* Come to an agreement on your project specifications before translation begins.
* Follow the specifications at every step of the project.

The CGSB 131.10 discuss the following:
* Scope
* Definitions
* Human Resources
* Technical Resources
* Quality Management System
* Client-TSP Relationship
* TSP Project Management Procedures
* Translation Process
* Notes
* Appendixes:
** A. Project Recording
** B. Pre-Translation Processing
** C. Additional Services
	
The standard does not apply to interpreting or terminology services.

TSPs interested in getting certified can review the AILIA [http://www.ailia.ca/Certification+Preparation+Guide+CAN+CGSB Certification Preparation Guide]

The [http://www.ailia.ca/Translation+committee AILIA Translation Committee] takes care of the promotion of the Canadian Translation Standard and its certification.

==ASTM F2575-06==
The [[United States|American]] translation-services standard is the ''ASTM F2575-06 Standard Guide for Quality Assurance in Translation''.&lt;ref&gt;''New ASTM Translation Standard Published, Press Room, ATA - American Translators Association''&lt;/ref&gt;  It provides a framework for customers and translation-service providers desirous of agreeing on the specific requirements of a translation project.  It does ''not'' provide specific criteria for translation or project [[Quality (business)|quality]], as these requirements may be highly individual, but states [[parameter]]s that should be considered before beginning a translation project.  As the document's name suggests, it is a ''[[guideline]]'', informing stakeholders about what basic quality [[requirements]] are in need of compliance, rather than a [[prescriptive]] set of detail instructions for the translator.

==Criticism: over-dependence on standards==
There is, however, a view within the translation industry that, while not doing any actual harm, an over-reliance on such standards can give a false sense of security. Blindly following translation standards does not on its own provide real assurance regarding translation quality. The argument is that the path to quality in translation is by focusing more on providing on-going training and feedback to translators.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''''Triops longicaudatus''''' (commonly called '''longtail tadpole shrimp''', '''American tadpole shrimp''', or '''rice tadpole shrimp''') is a freshwater [[crustacean]] of the order [[Notostraca]], resembling a miniature [[horseshoe crab]]. It is characterized by an elongated, segmented body, a flattened shield-like brownish [[carapace]] covering two thirds of the thorax, and two long filaments on the abdomen. ''Triops'' refers to its three eyes, and ''longicaudatus'' refers to the elongated tail structures. ''Triops longicaudatus'' is found in freshwater ponds and pools, often in places where few higher forms of life can exist. Like its relative ''[[Triops cancriformis]]'', the longtail tadpole shrimp is considered a [[living fossil]] because its basic prehistoric morphology has changed little in the last 70 million years, exactly matching their ancient fossils. ''Triops longicaudatus'' is one of the oldest animal species still in existence.&lt;ref name="Grzimek"&gt;Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia. Volume 02 – Protostomes.

==Classification==
''Triops longicaudatus'' is a member of the crustacean class [[Branchiopoda]], which primarily contains freshwater animals with [[gill]]s on their legs. The class Branchiopoda is divided into the subclasses Sarsostraca, containing [[fairy shrimp]], and [[Phyllopoda]], containing all other members ([[cladocera]]ns, [[clam shrimp]]s, and the [[Notostraca|tadpole shrimp]]). The subclass name, literally meaning ''leaf-footed'', is derived from their flat, leaflike appendages. Notostracans are placed in the infraclass Calamanostraca, which also contains the extinct [[Kazacharthra]].&lt;ref name="Grzimek"/&gt;

''Triops longicaudatus'' is usually greyish yellow or brown in color, and differs from many other species by the absence of the second [[Maxilla (arthropod)|maxilla]]. Apart from ''[[Triops cancriformis]]'', it is the only tadpole shrimp species whose individuals display as many as three reproductive strategies: bisexual, unisexual ([[Parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]]), and [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]]; see [[Triops longicaudatus#Reproduction|below]]. ''Triops cancriformis'' is easily recognizable by its yellow [[carapace]] with dark spots, whilst ''T. longicaudatus'' individuals have a uniform carapace. The species also appeared about 50 million years later, and, as its name suggests, its elongated tail structures ([[cercopod]]s) are often nearly as long as the rest of the body; including the cercopods, the body may reach {{convert|75|mm|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor=June Latting &amp; Peter Glanville Rowlands |year=1995 |title=The California Desert: an Introduction to Natural Resources and Man's Impact |volume=2 |publisher=June Latting |place=Riverside, CA |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zSdHAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=triops+longicaudatus+mm&amp;dq=triops+longicaudatus+mm&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=peFvT_ydC4mViAL86_3IBQ&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwBjgK |isbn=9780963690852 |oclc=37199208 |page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Triops anatomy new.png|thumb|left|External anatomy of ''Triops longicaudatus'' (click on image for captions)]]
The head of ''Triops longicaudatus'' is typical of crustaceans and consists of five segments, but there is a tendency toward reduction of cephalic [[appendage]]s. The ''trunk'' is not distinctly divided into [[thorax]] and [[abdomen]]. Most trunk segments bear appendages. Zoologists find it difficult to decide where the thorax stops and the abdomen begins; the debate is seemingly endless. The first eleven trunk segments each bear a single pair of limbs. They are followed by segments that are fused similarly to those of [[millipede]]s, and as a result, each segment bears up to six pairs of limbs. The trunk ends with a region of limbless segments. Some zoologists consider the thorax to consist of the two regions with appendages, and the abdomen the region without appendages. Others believe the region of fused segments to be part of the abdomen.&lt;ref name="Lander"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webs.lander.edu/rsfox/invertebrates/triops.html |publisher=[[Lander University]] |work=Invertebrate Anatomy OnLine |title=''Triops longicaudatus'', Tadpole Shrimp |date=June 19, 2006 |author=Richard Fox |accessdate=October 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001030622/http://webs.lander.edu/rsfox/invertebrates/triops.html |archivedate=October 1, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For clarity, this article uses "thorax" to mean the two body regions with limbs.

===Carapace===
There is a [[carapace]] present, but no [[cephalothorax]], since no thoracic segment is fused with the head. The terms ''carapace'' and ''cephalothorax'' often are confused, but should not be. The carapace of crustaceans is a fold of the body wall of the fifth head segment.

===Head===
[[File:Mouthparts.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mouthparts: 1 – ventral groove; 2 – labrum (upper lip); 3 – mandible]]
The head bears a pair of [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] [[compound eye]]s that lie close to each other and are nearly fused together. The compound eyes are generally sessile (not stalked). In addition, there is a [[Nauplius (larva)|naupliar]] [[ocellus]] (the "third eye") between them. The compound eyes are on the surface of the head, but the ocellus is deep within the head. All the eyes, however, are easily visible through the shell covering of the head. A distinct horizontal groove, known as the mandibular groove, marks the division between the anterior three head segments and the posterior two. Posterior to it is the cervical groove, marking the division between the head and the thorax.

On the [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] side of the head is a lenslike window, admitting light to the naupliar eye, which is aimed both dorsally and ventrally. The first antennae (antennules) are small, slender filaments on the ventral surface of the head, at about the same level as the eyes. The second antennae are similar and lie laterally to the first. They are nonfunctioning. The large, well-developed [[Mandible (arthropod)|mandibles]] oppose each other across the ventral midline. The opposing surfaces bear strong brownish teeth. As the crustacean periodically opens and closes the mandibles the teeth move apart and close together. Of the usual crustacean head appendages, only the mandibles are well developed. In ''Triops longicaudatus'', the larger second maxillae are absent, only [[Maxilla (arthropod)|maxillules]] being present.&lt;ref name="Lander"/&gt;

===Thorax===
[[File:A thoracopod.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Magnified leg (thoracopod): 1–5 – endites; 6 – endopod; 7 – exopod; 8 – epipod; 9 – protopod]] The anterior thorax consists of eleven segments, each bearing a pair of appendages, called thoracopods or [[Decapod anatomy#Thorax / Pereon|pereiopod]]s. None of the thoracopods are modified into [[Decapod anatomy#Thorax / Pereon|maxilliped]]s for feeding. The posterior thorax consists of 16–25 segments, incompletely separated to form ''rings''. Each ring may consist of as many as six fused segments and bear up to six pairs of appendages (there are 54–66 limbs altogether).

Most of the thoracic appendages resemble each other, but the first eleven pairs are best developed. There is a slight tendency to regional specialization and the first pair of legs is unlike the rest. It is an elongated, [[Claw#Arthropods|cheliped]]-like structure with a sensory function, while all the other appendages aid in feeding, respiration, and locomotion. In females, the eleventh pair of legs is modified into brood pouches. The many legs posterior to the eleventh pair move the spent feeding and respiratory currents away.&lt;ref name="Lander"/&gt;

===Abdomen===
The posterior 5–14 rings at the end of the body do not bear appendages. At the end of the body is a pleotelson (fusion of the last abdominal segment and the [[telson]]) connected to long, multisegmented [[Decapod anatomy#Abdomen / Pleon|uropods]].&lt;ref name="Lander"/&gt;

===Feeding behavior===
The feeding method of tadpole shrimps is similar to that proposed for the ancestral [[crustacean]]. The anterior appendages (second pair to tenth pair) stir sediments and swirl muddy water into the wide, midventral food groove. The ''gnathobases'' (inward-facing lobes at the base of the leg) guide food anteriorly to the mouth. The large flat exopods (outward-facing lobes at the end of the leg) stir and lift the sediments. Fine silt particles and water escape easily, but large, coarse food particles are torn into smaller pieces by the blade-like, inward-facing lobes called ''endopods'' at the end of the leg.

===Internal anatomy===
The heart of tadpole shrimps is a long dorsal tube in the anterior eleven trunk segments. It has a pair of [[ostium (anatomy)|ostia]] in each of these segments. Sometimes [[hemoglobin]] is present in its blood and the crustacean may be pink as a result. The [[Excretion|excretory]] organs are the paired maxillary [[gland]]s, located on the segment of the second maxilla. The long looped ducts of these glands can be seen in the carapace. The role of the maxillary glands is primarily [[Osmoregulation|osmoregulatory]].

==Reproduction and development==
===Reproduction===
{{double image|right|Vernal Pools 2.jpg|180|Vernal Pools 3.jpg|120|A typical [[vernal pool]] during the wet season|Another vernal pool, this one dried out}}
''Triops'' ''longicaudatus'' displays several reproductive strategies. Individuals may reproduce sexually, but this is rare, as most populations are highly male- or female-biased. [[Parthenogenesis]] (development from unfertilized eggs) is the most common reproductive strategy. Some populations, however, consist of [[hermaphrodite]]s who fertilize each other. Different populations display different strategies or combinations of strategies, and may therefore, be considered separate [[species]] or [[subspecies]] in the future.

In females, the eleventh pair of legs is modified into egg sacs, where the eggs are carried for several hours. The eggs are released in batches, have a thick shell, and can stand freezing temperatures as well as drought, enabling the population to survive from one season to the next. The eggs have to dry out completely before being submerged in water again in order to hatch successfully; they may remain in a state of [[diapause]] for up to 20 years. These eggs may have helped ''Triops longicaudatus'', as well as other notostracans, to survive the various natural disasters and [[mass extinction]]s to date.&lt;ref name="Grzimek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zooplankton"/&gt;

===Life cycle===
To complete their lives, tadpole shrimps depend on the changing nature of the [[Vernal pool|temporary waters]] they inhabit. During the dry season (summer and fall), their offspring stay inside the eggs. As the pool fills with rainwater during the winter and spring, they hatch and feed on [[fairy shrimp]]s and other invertebrates. The first larval stage (the [[metanauplius]]) is orange in color. It has a single eye, six legs, and develops through [[instar]]s (growth stages). Each instar ends with [[Ecdysis|shedding]] the exoskeleton. The number of segments and appendages increases as ''Triops '' grow, and they slowly change to greyish brown. In approximately eight days, they reach maturity and lay eggs. Adult ''Triops'' die as the pools dry up. ''Triops'' generally live for about 20–90 days if the pool does not dry up.&lt;ref name="Encarta"/&gt;

==Ecology==
[[File:Triopslongred1.jpg|thumbnail|Red variant of Triops longicaudatus raised in captivity.]]
''T. longicaudatus'' is the most widespread notostracan species, and may be found in western North America, South America, Japan, South Korea, and several [[Pacific Islands]]. It is most active at a temperature of approximately {{convert|20|C|F}}, and is usually found scratching the mud at the bottom of pools, searching for [[Benthic zone|benthic]] food. Triops collect food particles by straining the water with hairs on their limbs. Loose food particles are collected in a groove running down the underside of the body lengthwise, and held together by a sticky secretion until they are swallowed by their very small (2&amp;nbsp;mm wide) mouth. The tiny mouth is deep in its underbelly, and while the animal is capable of breaking up plant roots or dead fish, it is incapable of chasing down and eating prey larger than it is.

===Diet===
[[File:Triops longicaudatus eating his companion - Cannibalism.jpg|thumb|A ''Triops'' eating his companion]]
[[Tadpole shrimps]] are [[omnivorous]] and may eat algae, insects, and other [[Organic matter|organic debris]]; they are known to chase very small fry, tadpoles, and [[Oligochaeta|oligochaete]] worms.&lt;ref name="Lander"/&gt; In general, they eat anything organic that is smaller than they are, which even may include their siblings (they are [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalistic]]). In turn, ''Triops longicaudatus'' are eaten by frogs and birds.&lt;ref name="billingsgazette"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/wyoming/article_f1622053-a9e8-5063-b4aa-8b6a1ad0b939.html |publisher=[[Billings Gazette]] |title=Wet weather revives crustaceans prehistoric heritage |author=Allison Batdorff |date=June 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interaction with humans===
[[File:Triops longicaudatus2.jpg|thumb|right|Adult 2.5 cm pet ''Triops'' in aquarium]]
The species is considered a human ally against the [[West Nile virus]], as the individuals consume ''[[Culex]]'' mosquito larvae. They also are used as a [[biological agent]] in Japan, eating weeds in rice [[Paddy field|paddies]]. In [[Wyoming]], the presence of ''Triops longicaudatus'' usually indicates a good chance of the hatching of [[American spadefoot toads|spadefoot frog]]s.

Dried eggs of ''Triops'' ''longicaudatus'' are sold in kits to be raised as aquarium pets, sold under the name of "aquasaurs", "trigons" or "triops". These are most often of the greenish-brown variety, but the red variant is fairly common among enthusiasts. Captive ''Triops'' are frequently kept in aquariums and fed a diet consisting mainly of carrots, shrimp pellets and dried shrimp. Often they are also given living shrimp and daphnia as live prey. Because they can feed on just about anything, they are also fed lunch meat, potatoes, crackers, etc. They will often feed themselves by grazing on algae and other grunge from the bottom and sides of the tank and on small particles clinging to sponge filters or to [[Marimo]] moss balls, which are often cultured alongside Triops.

==Distribution==
[[File:Triopslongredcanc.jpg|350px|thumbnail|Though they make fine captive tank mates, Triops longicaudatus red and Triops cancriformis are not likely to be found together in the wild, nor to feed on carrots. Marimo moss balls are also unlikely companions.]]

''Triops longicaudatus'' is widespread in [[North America]]. In [[Canada]], it is found only in the provinces of [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aquatax.ca/crayfish.html |title=Saskatchewan Macrocrustacea |author=Dale Parker |accessdate=October 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widespread throughout the contiguous [[United States]], [[Mexico]], and [[Hawaii]], but not [[Alaska]]. Tadpole shrimps may be found in parts of [[South America]], in ([[Argentina]] and [[Galápagos Islands]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biota.org.br/pdf/v4cap17.pdf |publisher=biota.org.br/ |title=CLASSE BRANCHIOPODA}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[West Indies]], and the [[Pacific Islands]], including [[Japan]] and [[New Caledonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mytriops.com/articles/triops_species2.stm |publisher=MyTriops.com |title=Species Descriptions |accessdate=October 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006181802/http://mytriops.com/articles/triops_species2.stm |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leafyseadragon2276ppx PLW edit.JPG|thumb|237px|[[Leafy sea dragon]] avoids recognition by predators, with alga-like coloration, protuberances and behaviour]]

'''Underwater camouflage''' is the set of methods of achieving [[crypsis]]—avoidance of observation—that allows otherwise visible aquatic [[organism]]s to remain unnoticed by other organisms such as [[predator]]s or [[prey]].

[[Camouflage]] in large bodies of water differs markedly from camouflage on land. The environment is essentially the same on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background{{efn|The zoologist [[Peter Herring]] notes that even the word "background" is land-based.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–195}} But the sea surface is continually changing.}} to compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and [[counter-illumination]]. Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.

Camouflage in relatively shallow waters is more like terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by many animals. For example, self-decoration is employed by [[decorator crab]]s; [[mimesis]] by animals such as the [[leafy sea dragon]]; [[countershading]] by many fish including [[shark]]s; distraction with [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]] by many fish; [[active camouflage]] through ability to change colour rapidly in [[fish]] such as the flounder, and [[cephalopod]]s including [[octopus]], [[cuttlefish]], and [[squid]].

== Context ==
{{main article|Camouflage}}

The ability to camouflage oneself provides a survival advantage in the constant struggle between [[predator]]s and [[prey]]. [[Natural selection]] has produced a wide variety of methods of survival in the oceans.&lt;ref name="Sewell"&gt;{{cite web |title=Aquarium Fish: Physical Crypsis: Mimicry and Camouflage |author=Sewell, Aaron |date=March 2010 |url=http://www.advancedaquarist.com/2010/3/fish2 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Aristotle]] commented on the color-changing abilities, both for camouflage and for signalling, of [[cephalopod]]s including the [[octopus]], in his ''[[Historia animalium]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]]. ''[[Historia Animalium]]''. IX, 622a: 2-10. About 400 BC. Cited in Luciana Borrelli, [[Francesca Gherardi]], Graziano Fiorito. ''A catalogue of body patterning in Cephalopoda''.

:The octopus ... seeks its prey by so changing its colour as to render it like the colour of the stones adjacent to it; it does so also when alarmed.

Three main camouflage methods predominate in the oceans: transparency,&lt;ref name=Johnsen&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1543609 | title=Hidden in Plain Sight: The Ecology and Physiology of Organismal Transparency | author=Johnsen, Sönke | journal=[[Biological Bulletin]] |date=December 2001 | volume=201 | issue=3 | pages=301–318 | doi=10.2307/1543609 | pmid=11751243}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflection, and counterillumination.&lt;ref name=McFall&gt;{{cite journal | title=Crypsis in the Pelagic Environment | author=McFall-Ngai, Margaret J | journal=[[American Zoologist]] | year=1990 | volume=30 | issue=1 | pages=175–188 | doi=10.1093/icb/30.1.175}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–195}} Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counterillumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.&lt;ref name=McFall/&gt; Most animals of the open sea use at least one of these methods to camouflage themselves.&lt;ref name=McFall/&gt; Camouflage in relatively shallow waters is more like terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by animals in many different groups. These methods of camouflage are described in turn below.

===Transparency===
[[File:Expl0469 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Many animals of the open sea, like this ''[[Aurelia labiata]]'' jellyfish, are largely transparent.]]

Transparency is common, even dominant, in animals of the open sea, especially those that live in relatively shallow waters. It is found in [[plankton]] of many species, as well as larger animals such as [[jellyfish]], [[salps]] (floating [[tunicates]]), and [[comb jellies]].{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–195}}
Many marine animals that float near the surface are highly [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]], giving them almost perfect camouflage.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} However, transparency is difficult for bodies made of materials that have different [[refractive index|refractive indices]] from seawater. Some marine animals such as [[jellyfish]] have gelatinous bodies, composed mainly of water; their thick mesogloea is acellular and highly transparent. This conveniently makes them [[buoyancy|buoyant]], but it also makes them large for their muscle mass, so they cannot swim fast.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Gelatinous [[plankton]]ic animals are between 50 and 90 per cent transparent. A transparency of 50 per cent is enough to make an animal invisible to a predator such as [[cod]] at a depth of {{convert|650|m|ft}}; better transparency is required for invisibility in shallower water, where the light is brighter and predators can see better. For example, a cod can see prey that are 98 per cent transparent in optimal lighting in shallow water. Therefore, transparency is most effective in deeper waters.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}}

[[File:2 - Aphia minuta 03-11-06 DSCF4095.jpg|thumb|The [[transparent goby]]]]

Some tissues such as [[muscle]]s can be made transparent, provided either they are very thin or organised as regular layers or fibrils that are small compared to the wavelength of visible light. Familiar examples of transparent body parts are the lens and [[cornea]] of the vertebrate [[eye]]. The lens is made of the protein [[crystallin]]; the [[cornea]] is made of the protein [[collagen]].{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Other structures cannot be made transparent, notably the [[retina]]s or equivalent light-absorbing structures of eyes — they must absorb light to be able to function. The [[camera]]-type eye of vertebrates and cephalopods must be completely opaque.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Finally, some structures are visible for a reason, such as to lure prey. For example, the [[nematocyst]]s (stinging cells) of the transparent [[siphonophore]] ''[[Agalma okenii]]'' resemble small [[copepod]]s.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Examples of transparent marine animals include a wide variety of [[larva]]e, including [[coelenterates]], siphonophores, salps, [[gastropoda|gastropod molluscs]], [[polychaete]] worms, many shrimplike [[crustaceans]], and fish; whereas the adults of most of these are opaque and pigmented, resembling the seabed or shores where they live.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}}{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=6}} Adult comb jellies and jellyfish are mainly transparent, like their watery background.{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=6}} The small [[Amazon river]] fish ''[[Microphilypnus amazonicus]]'' and the shrimps it associates with, ''[[Pseudopalaemon gouldingi]]'', are so transparent as to be "almost invisible"; further, these species appear to select whether to be transparent or more conventionally mottled (disruptively patterned) according to the local background in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1679-62252006000200008&amp;script=sci_arttext | title=The almost invisible league: crypsis and association between minute fishes and shrimps as a possible defence against visually hunting predators |author1=Carvalho, Lucélia Nobre |author2=Zuanon, Jansen |author3=Sazima, Ivan | journal=[[Neotropical Ichthyology]] |date=April–June 2006 | volume=4 | issue=2 | pages=219–224 | doi=10.1590/S1679-62252006000200008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fish are covered with highly reflective scales, giving the appearance of [[silver]]ed [[mirror]] glass. Reflection through silvering is widespread or dominant in fish of the open sea, especially those that live in the top 100 metres. Where transparency cannot be achieved, it can be imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal's body highly reflective. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as [[sardine]] and [[herring]] are camouflaged by silvering.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=193–195}}

The [[marine hatchetfish]] is extremely flattened laterally (side to side), leaving the body just millimetres thick, and the body is so silvery as to resemble [[aluminium foil]]. The mirrors consist of microscopic structures similar to those used to provide [[structural coloration]]: stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of [[guanine]] spaced about ¼ of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=193–195}}

In fish such as the herring which live in shallower water, the mirrors must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks with a range of different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=193–195}} Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish. The [[cephalopods]], including squid, octopus and cuttlefish, have multi-layer mirrors made of protein rather than guanine.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=193–195}}

===Counter-illumination===
[[File:Squid Counterillumination.png|thumb|Principle of squid [[counter-illumination]]]]
{{main article|Counter-illumination}}
Counter-illumination through [[bioluminescence]] on the underside (ventral region) of the body is found in many species that live in the open ocean down to about 1000 metres. The generated light increases an animal's brightness when seen from below to match the brightness of the ocean surface; it is an effective form of [[active camouflage]]. It is notably used by some species of [[squid]], such as the [[Abralia veranyi|midwater squid]], ''Abralia veranyi''. These have light-producing organs ([[photophores]]) scattered all over their undersides, creating a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below.&lt;ref name="Abralia with photo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-photos/midwater-squid-abralia-veranyi | title=Midwater Squid, Abralia veranyi | publisher=[[Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]] | accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-illumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/1983/00000033/00000004/art00003 | title=Oceanic Bioluminescence: an Overview of General Functions | author=Young, Richard Edward | journal=[[Bulletin of Marine Science]] |date=October 1983 | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=829–845}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to detect prey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Long-wave sensitivity in deep-sea stomiid dragonfish with far-red bioluminescence: evidence for a dietary origin of the chlorophyll-derived retinal photosensitizer of Malacosteus niger |author1=Douglas, RH |author2=Mullineaux, CW |author3=Partridge, JC | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |date=September 2000 | volume=355 | issue=1401 | pages=1269–1272 | pmc=1692851 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0681 | pmid=11079412}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for signalling.

===Countershading===
[[File:Adelie Penguin2.jpg|thumb|[[Adelie penguin]]s, ''Pygoscelis adeliae'', are white below and dark above.]]
{{main article|Countershading}}

Top/bottom countershading is common in fish including [[shark]]s, [[marlin]], and [[mackerel]], and animals in other groups such as dolphins, turtles and penguins. These animals have dark upper sides to match the ocean depths, and light undersides to avoid appearing dark against the bright sea surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rowland | first=Hannah M.  | jstor=40485817 | title=Abbott Thayer to the present day: what have we learned about the function of countershading?| journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] | year=2009 | volume=364 | pages=519–527 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0261 | pmid=19000972 | pmc=2674085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ruxton, Graeme D |author2=Speed, Michael P |author3=Kelly, David J | title=What, if anything, is the adaptive function of countershading?|journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] | year=2004 | volume=68 | pages=445–451 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.12.009| url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/biology/jbasil/documents/COUNTERSHADINGCLASS10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mimesis===
&lt;!--[[File:Leaf Scorpionfish in Kona.jpg|thumb|Leaf scorpionfish mimics vegetation swaying in a current.]]--&gt;
[[File:Juvenile rockmover in Kona.jpg|thumb|left|Juvenile rockmover, ''[[Novaculichthys taeniourus]]'', mimics algae]]
{{main article|Mimicry}}

Mimesis is practised by animals such as the [[leafy sea dragon]], ''Phycodurus eques'', and the [[Taenianotus triacanthus|leaf scorpionfish]], ''Taenianotus triacanthus'', which resemble parts of plants, and gently rock their bodies as if swayed by a current.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=341–342}}&lt;ref name="Leaf Scorpionfish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leaf Scorpionfish |url=http://ocean.nationalgeographic.com/ocean/photos/undersea-camouflage/#camouflage07-leaf-scorpionfish_13513_600x450.jpg |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eight interesting facts about the Leaf Scorpionfish"&gt;{{cite web |title=Eight interesting facts about the Leaf Scorpionfish |url=http://www.daveharasti.com/articles/speciesspotlight/leafscorpionfish.htm |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fish species ''[[Novaculichthys taeniourus]]'', the rockmover or dragon wrasse, there is a striking difference in appearance between the adults and the juveniles. A juvenile Rockmover resembles a loose piece of [[sea weed]]. It swims in a vertical position with its head pointing downwards, and behaves in a way that perfectly resembles the movement of a piece of seaweed: moving back and forth in the surge, as if it was inanimate.&lt;ref name="Rockmover Wrasse"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Dragon Wrasse: The Good, The Bad, and The Beautiful |url=http://www.fishchannel.com/fish-magazines/aquarium-fish-international/april-2011/dragon-wrasse.aspx |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-decoration===
[[File:Sea urchin decorated with shells.jpg|thumb|Self-decorated [[sea urchin]]]]

Self-decoration is employed by animals in different groups, including [[decorator crab]]s, which attach materials from their environment, as well as living organisms, to camouflage themselves. For example, the Japanese hermit crab, ''[[Eupagurus constans]]'', has the hydroid ''[[Hydractinia sodalis]]'' growing all over the shell that it lives in. Another hermit crab, ''[[Eupagurus cuanensis]]'', has the [[aposematic]] orange sponge ''[[Suberites domuncula]]'' which is bitter-tasting and not eaten by fish.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=361–362}}

Similarly, [[sea urchin]]s use their tube feet to pick up debris from the bottom and attach it to their upper surfaces. They use shells, rocks, algae and sometimes [[sea anemone]]s.&lt;ref name="Echinoderms"&gt;{{cite web | title=Echinoderms | url=http://www.starfish.ch/reef/echinoderms.html | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distraction===
[[File:Four-Eye Butterflyfish.jpg|thumb|Four-Eye Butterflyfish, ''[[Chaetodon capistratus]]'', showing its concealed eye and false eyespot near the tail]]

Many fish have eyespots near their tails, a form of [[automimicry]], to distract attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, ''[[Chaetodon capistratus]]'' has both a (disruptive) eyestripe to conceal the eye, and a large eyespot near its tail, giving the impression that the head is at the tail end of the body.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=372–374}}

===Disruption of outlines===
{{main article|Disruptive coloration}}

Fish such as ''[[Dascyllus aruanus]]'' have bold disruptive patterns on their sides, breaking up their outlines with strong contrasts. Fish like ''[[Heniochus macrolepidotus]]'' have similar bands of colour that extend into fins projecting far from the body, distracting attention from the true shape of the fish.{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=73}}

Some fish which mimic seaweeds such as the [[frogfish]]es ''[[Antennarius marmoratus]]'' and ''[[Pterophryne tumida]]'' have elaborate projections and spines which are combined with complex disruptive coloration. These have the effect of destroying the signature "fish" outline of these animals, as well as helping them to appear as pieces of algae.{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=341}}

===Adaptive coloration===
[[File:Octopus cyaneain Kona.jpg|thumb|The big blue octopus hunts by day, changing its colours and pattern to be cryptic or for signalling]]
{{further information|Active camouflage}}

A variety of marine animals possess [[active camouflage]] through their ability to change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling.&lt;ref name="Cephalopod dynamic camouflage"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hanlon, Roger |journal=Current Biology |volume=17 |issue=11 |title=Cephalopod dynamic camouflage |url=http://www.mbl.edu/pspb/files/2014/05/hanlon_currentbiol_2007.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011091531/http://www.mbl.edu/pspb/files/2014/05/hanlon_currentbiol_2007.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-10-11 |accessdate=2010-04-28 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.03.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[big blue octopus]], ''Octopus cyanea'', hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.&lt;ref name="DayOctopus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Day Octopuses, Octopus cyanea|url=http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=553|publisher=MarineBio|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peacock Flounder Bothus mancus in Kona.jpg |thumb |left |Four frames of a [[peacock flounder]] taken a few minutes apart]]

Like all flounders, [[Peacock flounder]]s, ''Bothus mancus'', have excellent adaptive camouflage. They use cryptic coloration to avoid being detected by both prey and predators. Whenever possible rather than swim, they crawl on their fins along the bottom while constantly changing colours and patterns to match their background. In a study, some flounders demonstrated the ability to change pattern in eight seconds. They were able to match the pattern of checkerboards that they were placed on. Changing pattern is an extremely complex process involving the flounder's vision and [[hormone]]s. If one of the fish's eyes is damaged, or covered by the sand, the flounder has difficulties in matching its pattern to its surroundings. Whenever the fish is hunting or hiding from predators, it buries itself into the sand, leaving only the eyes protruding.&lt;ref name="Camouflage under water"&gt;{{cite web | title=Camouflage under water | url=http://www.seafriends.org.nz/indepth/camouflage.htm | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The fisherman's ocean"&gt;{{cite book | title=The fisherman's ocean |author = Ross, David A | page=136 |year=2000 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hz9AWzpJydoC&amp;pg=PA136 |location=Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania |isbn=9780811727716 |publisher=[[Stackpole Books]] | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peacock Flounder"&gt;{{cite web |title=Peacock Flounder |url=https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/discover/species-profiles/bothus-lunatus |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This coded alert had been used by German educators after the [[Erfurt massacre|Erfurt school massacre]] in April 2002.&lt;ref name="guardian12-03"/&gt;

After receiving an emergency call from a student at 09:33&amp;nbsp;local time,&lt;ref name="BBCtimeline"/&gt; three police officers reached the scene two minutes later and entered the school, interrupting the shooting spree.&lt;ref name="Stuttgart Journal"/&gt; Kretschmer shot at them and fled the building, killing two female teachers in the hall as he departed. He killed a total of 12 people at the school.&lt;ref name="schoolshoot-AP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuttgart Journal"/&gt; A quantity of unused ammunition was recovered from the school.

At approximately 10:00, the gunman [[carjacked]] a [[Volkswagen Sharan]] minivan at a car park in Winnenden. From his position on the rear seat, the gunman ordered the driver Igor Wolf to drive towards [[Wendlingen]], {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Winnenden. The gunman and the driver went westwards into the suburbs of [[Stuttgart]], the [[Baden-Württemberg]] state capital, travelling through the towns and districts of [[Waiblingen]], [[Fellbach]] and [[Bad Cannstatt]], before driving on the B14 [[dual carriageway]] through the Heslach Tunnel onto the A81 [[autobahn]] motorway towards [[Böblingen]] and [[Tübingen]]. The two drove onto the B27 dual carriageway before leaving on the B313 to [[Nürtingen]].

Igor Wolf later reported that, when asked why he was doing this, the gunman replied, "For fun, because it is fun."

Shortly after 12:00, just before the Wendlinger junction to the A8 ''autobahn'', the hostage steered the car onto the grass verge and jumped from the vehicle toward a [[police car|police patrol car]].&lt;ref name="Stuttgart Journal"/&gt;{{verification failed|date=July 2016|reason=cite URL is dead; no mention on 2012 archive of URL from of time 12:00 p.m., although noon is consisent with guardian source}}

===Wendlingen shootout===
The gunman immediately left the car and ran towards the nearby industrial area, entering a [[Volkswagen]] car showroom through the main entrance. He threatened a salesperson and demanded a key for one of the vehicles. The salesperson escaped while the gunman was distracted. The gunman shot and killed another salesperson and a customer, firing 13 bullets into both people. As he reloaded, another salesperson and visitor fled through the rear exit.&lt;ref name="Stuttgart Journal"/&gt; The gunman emerged at about 12:30 and shot at a passing car. The driver escaped without injury. The police started to arrive and a shootout began. An officer fired eight shots at the gunman, hitting him once in each leg.&lt;ref name="Stuttgart Journal"/&gt;

The gunman returned to the car showroom, firing 12 shots from within the building at police from nearby [[Nürtingen]], who were gradually surrounding the building. He left the rear of the building and ran across a yard to a neighbouring business complex, where he shot and injured two police officers in an unmarked police vehicle.&lt;ref name="Stuttgart Journal"/&gt;

According to police reports, at this point Kretschmer continued to shoot at random, shooting at nearby buildings and people, including an employee of a firm who was trying to lock the door. Witnesses described observing the gunman as he reloaded his pistol before shooting himself in the head.&lt;ref name="schoolshoot-AP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuttgart Journal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronology of a Mass Murder: 'The Scope of this Disaster Is Incomprehensible'"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/,tt2m1/panorama/719/461345/text/ | title=Das wortlose Töten des Tim K. | accessdate=11 March 2009 | date=11 March 2009 | publisher=sueddeutsche.de | language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final seconds of the shootout were captured with a cell phone video camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/2009/03/12/winnenden/video-die-letzten-sekunden/des-schul-amok-killers.html|title=Die letzten Sekunden des Amok-Killers von Winnenden|accessdate=1 July 2018|publisher= bild.de |date= 12 March 2009|language=German|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
Kretschmer's failing grades had prevented him from entering an [[apprenticeship]]. He was attending a commercial high school (Donner + Kern) in [[Waiblingen]] to prepare for an apprenticeship for a commercial career. Several accounts described him as suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bz-berlin.de/archiv/der-amok-schuetze-17-war-wegen-depressionen-in-der-nervenklinik-die-arzte-konnten-seine-kranke-seele-nicht-heilen-article395103.html|title= Polizei fand Killerspiele, Horrorfilme und Pornobilder auf dem Computer von Kretschmer +++ Er war Einzelgänger und hatte keine Freundin – Der Amok-Schütze (17) war wegen Depressionen in der Nervenklinik.

He was an avid table tennis player and had hoped to become a professional player.&lt;ref name="schoolshoot-AP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel2"/&gt; Marko Habijanec, a Croatian table tennis player who coached Kretschmer at the Erdmannhausen sports club between 2000 and 2003, remembers him as being "a bit spoiled", with his mother fulfilling many of his demands.&lt;ref name="Jutarnji"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/clanak/art-2009,3,13,,155619.jl | title=Marko Habijanec: Trenirao sam monstruma | date= 13 March 2009 |work=[[Jutarnji list]] | language=Croatian | accessdate=15 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Habijanec, Kretschmer had great difficulties accepting defeat: he would have a temper [[tantrum]], yelling and throwing his racket.&lt;ref name="Jutarnji"/&gt; The coach said that, having a high opinion of his own abilities, Kretschmer openly denigrated his teammates.&lt;ref name="Jutarnji"/&gt; When Habijanec discussed Tim's attitude with his mother, he discovered she sided fully with her son.&lt;ref name="Jutarnji"/&gt;

Media reports say he enjoyed playing the video game ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' and playing with [[airsoft]] guns.&lt;ref name="guardian12-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel3"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/0,1518,612826,00.html | title= Polizei hat Hinweise auf Tatmotiv | accessdate=12 March 2009 | date=12 March 2009 |work=Der Spiegel  | language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berliner Kurier"&gt;[http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-kurier/nachrichten/timkretschmerpsychogrammeineskillers/ Tim Kretschmer: Psychogramm eines Killers]&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators also noted that "game addiction is a symptom of something wrong and not a cause".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/comment/2009/03/do-you-think-th.html|title=Did video games cause the shooting in Germany?}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also shot his guns in the forest behind his home and also in the basement of his house.&lt;ref name="guardian12-03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel3"/&gt; On his last day alive, Kretschmer played the video game ''[[Far Cry 2]]'' online as "JawsPredator1".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news-times.de/Artikelsenden/10581289/Aktuelle-Nachrichten/20107239|title=Verwirrung um Therapie von Tim K. – Eltern des Amokschützen dementieren Behandlung – Schütze spielte vor der Tat Killerspiel| accessdate=19 March 2009 | date=11 March 2009 | publisher=news-times.de | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online activities===
He had profiles at "[[MyVideo]].de", Kwick.de and other websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_2485515,00.html|title=Teen 'played video games' | accessdate=19 March 2009 | date=14 March 2009 | publisher=[[News24|www.news24.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He often played poker with his classmates in the "Cafe Tunix" after school hours in Waiblingen.&lt;ref name="Bild letzter Tag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/2009/03/13/winnenden/tim-kretschmer-letzter-tag/mathe-klausur-pizza-poker-letzter-tag-vor-amok-lauf.html|title=''Tim Kretschmers letzter Tag'' (''Tim Kretschmer's last day'')| accessdate=11 March 2009 | date=11 March 2009 | publisher=Bild | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After inspection of his computer, officers found that Kretschmer was interested in [[Dominatrix|sadomasochistic scenes where a man is bound and humiliated by women]]. He viewed such a movie the evening before his attacks.&lt;ref name=sz99&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/537/486948/text/ Tim brauchte Hilfe], ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', 9 September 2009. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health problems===
Kretschmer did not have a criminal record.&lt;ref name="Stuttgart Journal"/&gt; The press reported that in 2008, Kretschmer had received treatment as an [[in-patient]] at the Weissenhoff Psychiatric Clinic near the town of [[Heilbronn]]. After being discharged, Kretschmer was supposed to continue his treatment as an [[out-patient]] in Winnenden, but ended his treatment.&lt;ref name="Stuttgart Journal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Times online"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5898272.ece|title=Teenage killer Tim Kretschmer had stopped treatment for depression| accessdate=11 March 2009 | date=11 March 2009|work=The Times |location=London  | first1=Fran | last1=Yeoman | first2=David | last2=Charter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to police and clinic staff, he had been treated repeatedly for clinical [[Depression (mood)|depression]] on an out-patient basis in 2008. His family rejected these claims and maintained that he never received psychiatric treatment.&lt;ref name=sz3&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/84/461708/text/ |title=War Tim K. in Therapie? |accessdate=13 March 2009 |publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung |date=14 March 2009 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a psychiatric report prepared for the prosecutor's office, Kretschmer met five times with a therapist and talked about his growing anger and violent urges; the therapist informed Kretschmer's parents.&lt;ref name="sz99"/&gt;

===Possible motives===
In a press conference on 12 March, police reported that Kretschmer had announced his killing spree several hours ahead of time on [[Krautchan.net|Krautchan]].&lt;ref name="guardian12-03"/&gt; The next day, police determined that this message had not been written on Kretschmer's computer and was a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtl.de/rtlaktuell/rtl_aktuell_artikel.php?article=26422&amp;pos=1|title=Polizeipanne? Innenminister redet sich raus|accessdate=23 March 2009|publisher=RTL.de|date=2009-03-13|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three weeks before the shooting, Kretschmer had written a letter to his parents, saying that he was suffering and could not go on.&lt;ref name="Timesonline-0312"/&gt;

In an interview in 2014, Kretschmer's parents stated that they had always loved their son and that they did not have an explanation for his actions. They have since changed their name and moved to a different city.&lt;ref name=welt/&gt;

== Victims ==
Kretschmer killed 15 people, including nine students and three teachers at the school, before killing himself.

== Source of the gun, indictment of the father ==
Police raided the Kretschmer family house at about 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on the day of the shooting. Tim Kretschmer's father legally owned 15 guns as a member of a local marksmen club ("[[Schützenverein]]" in German).&lt;ref name="schoolshoot-AP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g-7Dbm7W0ADoXhfKS2O_sUrZu4NwD96S47T01|title=Teen kills 15 in Germany before taking own life|last=Gera|first=Vanessa |publisher=The Associated Press|accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One 9&amp;nbsp;mm [[Beretta]] handgun was found missing, along with several hundred rounds of ammunition.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4088804,00.html |title=Teenage Gunman Killed by Police After German School Shooting |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=11 March 2009|accessdate=11 March 2009 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen of the guns were kept in a [[gun safe]], while the Beretta had been kept unsecured in the bedroom.&lt;ref name="sz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/758/461384/text/ | title=Schwarz wie der Tod | accessdate=11 March 2009 | date=11 March 2009 | publisher=sueddeutsche.de | language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five days after the event, prosecutors initiated preliminary proceedings against the father for [[negligent homicide]], since the gun had not been properly locked away as required by law.&lt;ref name="bild"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/2009/03/16/amok-killer-tim-kretschmer/staatsanwaltschaft-leitet-ermittlungsverfahren-gegen-vater-ein.html | title=Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelt gegen Vater | accessdate=16 March 2009 | date=16 March 2009 | publisher=Bild.de | language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; The police confiscated the 14 remaining guns. The father announced that he would voluntarily relinquish his gun ownership authorization.&lt;ref name=203sz/&gt;

In November 2009, the Public Prosecutor's Department in Stuttgart announced that the father had been indicted on charges of negligent homicide, bodily injury caused by negligence, and violation of the weapons law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/,ra4l1/panorama/532/495854/text/|title=Tim K.s Vater angeklagt|date=27 November 2009|work=sueddeutsche.de|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 February 2011, the state court in Stuttgart found the father guilty of involuntary manslaughter in 15 cases, bodily harm caused by negligence and the negligent abandonment of a weapon.

==Response==
German President [[Horst Köhler]] said he was "appalled and saddened" by the killings. Köhler and his wife expressed their condolences to the victims and their families and friends.&lt;ref name="reactions1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,612683,00.html|title=POLITICAL REACTIONS: Merkel 'Deeply Shaken' By School Shootings|work=Der Spiegel|date=11 March 2009|accessdate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] described the shootings as "incomprehensible". "It is unimaginable that in just seconds, pupils and teachers were killed – it is an appalling crime," she told reporters. "This is a day of mourning for the whole of Germany," she continued.&lt;ref name="BBCmain" /&gt; Baden-Württemberg [[List of Ministers-President of Baden-Württemberg|Minister-President]] [[Günther Oettinger]] travelled to the scene of the crime by helicopter shortly after the news broke. Oettinger spoke of a "horrible and in no way explainable crime". He also expressed his condolences to the victims, students and families. "This has touched all of Baden-Württemberg. The school, the town, the future, education, and raising children – to destroy these things like that is especially cruel."&lt;ref name="reactions1" /&gt; The [[European Parliament]] held a minute of silence to honour the dead.
An [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] Church service was held in Winnenden the evening of the shooting, with Protestant, Catholic, and Muslim clerics officiating. All German flags were flown on [[half-staff]] until 13 March, in memorial of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/11/content_10994626.htm|title=School shooting shocks Germany, chancellor appalled|first=Yan |date=11 March 2009|publisher=Xinhuanet|accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days following the event, some politicians called for legal consequences, including a total prohibition of all shooting video games, better monitoring of gun club members, a directive to have all ammunition deposited with police, and a provision to have gun club members store their weapons at the club house. Others dismissed such demands as "placebos".&lt;ref name=sz3/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel CSU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,613050,00.html| title=CSU will Killerspiel-Verbot, SPD Kontrolle über Schützenvereine|work=Der Spiegel | date=13 March 2009|language=German|accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The families of five victims wrote an open letter to Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Horst Köhler, and Baden-Württemberg Minister President Günther Oettinger with demands for consequences. They called for a prohibition on youths' access to guns in gun clubs, less violence on TV, and a prohibition of violent video games. They also called for reporting of these incidents without highlighting the perpetrator, so as to minimize the chance of copycats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/,tt4l1/panorama/895/462513/text/|title=Opferfamilien fordern Killerspiel-Verbot| publisher=sueddeutsche.de| date=21 March 2009|language=German|accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/wams_print/article3420239/Winnenden-Eine-Tat-aus-der-man-nicht-klug-werden-kann.html|title=Winnenden: Eine Tat, aus der man nicht klug werden kann|publisher=[[Die Welt|www.welt.de]]|date=21 March 2009|language=German|accessdate=24 March 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The German government passed legislation in June 2009 to improve handgun security with an electronic nationwide weapons registry, increased age limitations for large-calibre weapons, and unannounced, random inspections in gun-owner homes to ensure requirements for locked gun storage were met. Obligatory biometric security systems should be introduced once technically feasible.&lt;ref name="billigt"/&gt;

In May 2009, Germany announced plans to ban games such as [[paintball]] on the grounds that they "trivialise and encourage violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8041320.stm |work=BBC News | title=Germany moves to outlaw paintball | date=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/5291891/Germany-to-ban-paintball-in-wake-of-high-school-shooting.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London  | title=Germany to ban paintball in wake of high school shooting | date=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislature did not ban fighting games such as paintball, gotcha and laserdrome; did not limit the number of guns owned and did not pass a requirement to store guns with shooting clubs or restrictions regarding ammunition storage in private households.&lt;ref name="billigt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/politik/article1115547/Bundestag_billigt_verschaerftes_Waffenrecht.html|title=Bundestag billigt verschärftes Waffenrecht|publisher=[[Berliner Morgenpost]]|date=18 June 2009|language=German|accessdate=23 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
