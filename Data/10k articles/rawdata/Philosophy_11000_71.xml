'''Bà Tùng Long''' (1915 - 2006) was a [[Vietnam]]ese author and teacher.

==Biography==
'''Lê Thị Bạch Vân''' ({{zh|黎氏白雲}}), [[courtesy name]] '''Tùng Long'''&lt;ref&gt;By ''[[I Ching]] - [[List of hexagrams of the I Ching|Hexagram 1]] - 95'' that "[https://www.moedict.tw/雲從龍，風從虎 Vân tùng long, phong tùng hổ]" (雲從龍，風從虎).&lt;/ref&gt; (從龍), [[pen name]] '''Bà Tùng Long''' (婆從龍 / "Madame Tùng Long") was born on 1 August 1915 in [[Đà Nẵng]] (old [[birth certificate]] as 21 April 1915 in [[Hội An]]), [[Central Vietnam|French Annam]]. Her father [[Lê Tường]] was a journalist and politician who has been entered the [[:vi:Phong trào Duy Tân|Restoration Movement of Annam]] as a liaison man.

She has passed the [[primary education]] in [[Đà Nẵng]] and then one years at [[:vi:Trường Trung học phổ thông Hai Bà Trưng, Huế|Đồng Khánh High School]] in [[Huế]] Capital. Since 1932, she followed her father to come [[Saigon]] and studied at [[Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai High School|Collège Des Jeunes Filles Indigènes]]. So she started her love with journalist Hồng Tiêu who has a [[real name]] [[Nguyễn Đức Huy]].

She began her career as a journalist at the [[:vi:Phụ nữ tân văn|Phụ Nữ Tân Văn]] newspaper. When [[:vi:Phụ nữ tân văn|Phụ Nữ Tân Văn]] suspended, she has hired to rent [[Tân Thời]] newspaper's manchette and became the editor-in-chief. However, this newspaper was also suspended as soon. Then, she became a teacher for the [[French language|French]] and [[Cochinchinese]] language at Tôn Thọ Tường school, at the same time as the Saigon Newspaper's collaborator. During [[World War II]], her family (with her husband and 3 children) returned [[Nghĩa Kỳ]] commune ([[Quảng Ngãi Province]]) to settle. She was appointed as the united-[[headmistress]] for all of [[Nghĩa Kỳ]]'s schools by local educational office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/namkyluctinhorg/tac-gia-tac-pham/s-t-u-v/vuong-trung-duong/thien-chuc-nha-giao-tam-hon-nha-van-ba-tung-long Thiên chức nhà Giáo, tâm hồn nhà Văn : Bà Tùng Long]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, her family (adding 3 children) moved to [[Hội An]]. Since 1952, she became a professor for schools Les Lauries, Tân Thịnh, Đạt Đức ... but the low salaries. So she continued as newspaper's collaborator. From 1954, [[pen name]] Bà Tùng Long has been familiar on categories ''Gỡ Rối Tơ Lòng'' (New Saigon Newspaper) and ''Tâm Tình Cởi Mở'' (Echo Newspaper). She was known much as a writer for women and their families.

After the [[1954 Geneva Conference|Geneva Conference]], her family moved to [[Saigon]]. She was both a teacher and a newspaper's collaborator, example : Echo Newspaper, South Newspaper, Female Forum Newspaper, Future Female Newspaper, People Newspaper ... In 1960, she succeed in the election of [[Revolutionary Women Association]]'s Secretary-General.&lt;ref&gt;After the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|Saigon Coup]], that renamed as the ''Women Union of the [[Republic of Vietnam]]''&lt;/ref&gt; She was also [[Quảng Ngãi Province]]'s [[congresswoman]]. During 1960s, her earnings were 10 [[ounce]]s for writings. To 1972, she declared for her setting pencil aside. In 2003, she re-appeared with her book ''Memoir of Bà Tùng Long''.

'''Canchupati Venkatrao Vencaswami Rao''' (తెలుగులో కంచుపాటి వేంకట్రావు వెంకస్వామి రావు), also known as '''Master C.V.V.''' (August 4, 1868 in [[Kumbakonam]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] &amp;ndash; May 12, 1922) was a Yoga [[guru]]. His family name was Canchupati.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UGQOAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Canchupati+Venkatrao+Venkaswami+Rao&amp;dq=Canchupati+Venkatrao+Venkaswami+Rao&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAmoVChMIv_j80oalxwIVxTiICh2etAoy Prajna Prabhakaram, a Symbol of Transcendence and Immanence: Auto-biography of Sri Veturi Prabhakara Sastri], Vēṭūri Prabhākaraśāstri, Prabhakara Prachuranalu Publishers, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; He was born to a [[Niyogi]] family which had moved from [[Andhra Pradesh]] in the 14th or 15th century. He was educated in [[Kumbakonam]] and [[Srirangam]]. At age 12, he married Rukmini and they had three sons and a daughter. His wife died at age 36 and he married Venkamma at age 38 with whom he had another three daughters and a son.

He started ''Bhrukta Rahita Taraka Raja'' Yoga in 1910 with a goal to make changes to human format and to cosmic forces influencing human format in order to give eternal life to humanity. Some of his followers were [[w:es:Ekkirala Krishnamacharya|Ekkirala Krishnamacharya]] and [master hanumantharao-warangal].

Some philosophers {{who|date=September 2016}} believe that causality may not exist if determinism is true, as causality is merely the observation that one event precedes another, or that there is a pattern throughout spacetime in which events of one similar type tend to correlate with events of another similar type (that is, the mass-energy distribution in spacetime has an information theoretic 'pattern' where car crashes tend to be correlated with injury, say).  There may be no ultimate reason for why a chain of causality occurs the way that it does beyond the fact that a chain of causality exists.  The fact that certain events seem to 'cause' other events is the recognition of a pattern in the structure of spacetime and the mass-energy that exists in spacetime, which is ultimately either due OR an instantiation of the laws of physics.  Note: Stating that causality does not exist may be a bit misleading, as one would have to Define what is meant by 'causality' - it may be that causality is dependent upon [[counterfactual definiteness]], that is, A causes B because, if A did NOT occur, then B would not occur (i.e.: A is necessary for B) AND because A is sufficient for B.  It may be possible that causality is ultimately a meaningless concept (if one rejects [[counterfactual definiteness]] for instance), but that causal chains are still a valid concept (as they would merely be chains of events).

A '''Christian mission''' is an organized effort to spread [[Christianity]] to new converts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/385426/mission|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Missions often involve sending individuals and groups, called [[missionary|missionaries]], across boundaries, most commonly geographical boundaries, for the purpose of [[proselytism]] (conversion to Christianity, or from one Christian tradition to another). This involves [[evangelism]] (preaching a set of beliefs for the purpose of conversion), and humanitarian work, especially among the poor and disadvantaged. There are a few different kinds of mission trips: short-term, long-term, relational and ones meant simply for helping people in need. Some might choose to dedicate their whole lives to missions as well. Missionaries have the authority to preach the Christian faith (and sometimes to administer sacraments), and provide humanitarian work to improve . Christian doctrines (such as the "Doctrine of Love" professed by many missions) permit the provision of aid without requiring religious conversion.

==History of Christian missions==
{{main article|Timeline of Christian missions}}

The earliest Christian mission, then, the [[Great Commission]] and [[Dispersion of the Apostles]], was active within [[Second Temple Judaism]]. Whether a Jewish proselytism existed or not that would have served as a model for the [[early Christians]] is unclear, see [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity#Jewish background]] for details. Soon, the expansion of the Christian mission beyond Judaism to those who were not Jewish became a contested issue, notably at the [[Council of Jerusalem]]. The [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]] was an early proponent of this expansion, and contextualized the Christian message for the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] cultures, allowing it to reach beyond its Hebrew and Jewish roots.

From [[Late Antiquity]] onward, much missionary activity was carried out by members of [[Christian monasticism|religious orders]]. [[Monastery|Monasteries]] followed disciplines and supported missions, libraries, and practical research, all of which were perceived as works to reduce human misery and suffering and glorify the Christian God. For example, [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] communities evangelized parts of Central Asia, as well as Tibet, China, and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Philip|title=The Lost History of Christianity: The Thousand Year Golden Age of the Church in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia —and How It Died|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cistercian]]s evangelized much of [[North Europe|Northern Europe]], as well as developing most of European agriculture's classic techniques. [[St Patrick]] evangelized many in Ireland. [[St David]] was active in Wales.

During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Ramon Llull]] (c. 1232 – c. 1315) advanced the concept of preaching to Muslims and converting them to Christianity by means of non-violent argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bridger|first=J. Scott|title=Raymond Lull: Medieval Theologian, Philosopher, and Missionary to Muslims|journal=St Francis Magazine|date=February 2009|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1–25|url=http://www.stfrancismagazine.info/ja/images/pdf/Raymond-Lull-(JScott-Bridger).pdf|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vision for large-scale mission to Muslims would die with him, not to be revived until the 19th Century.

===Medieval===
During the Middle Ages Christian [[monasteries]] and missionaries such as [[Saint Patrick]], and [[Adalbert of Prague]] propagated learning and religion beyond the boundaries of the old Roman Empire. In the seventh century [[Gregory the Great]] sent missionaries, including [[Augustine of Canterbury]], into England.  The [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]] began in 563.

In the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, [[Franciscans]] such as [[William of Rubruck]], [[John of Montecorvino]], and [[Giovanni ed' Magnolia]] were sent as missionaries to the Near and Far East. Their travels took them as far as China in an attempt to convert the advancing [[Mongols]], especially the [[Great Khans]] of the Mongol Empire. (Also see [[Medieval Roman Catholic Missions in China]].)

===Catholic missions after 1492===
{{main article|Catholic missions}}
One of the main goals of the Christopher Columbus expedition financed by Queen Isabella of Spain was to spread Christianity. During the [[Age of Discovery]], Spain and Portugal established many missions in their American and Asian colonies. The most active orders were the [[Jesuits]], [[Augustinians]], [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]].  The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. These are some of the most well-known missions in history.  While some of these missions were associated with imperialism and oppression, others (notably [[Matteo Ricci]]'s Jesuit mission to China) were relatively peaceful and focused on integration rather than [[cultural imperialism]].

In both Portugal and Spain, religion was an integral part of the state and evangelization was seen as having both secular and spiritual benefits.  Wherever these powers attempted to expand their territories or influence, missionaries would soon follow.  By the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], the two powers divided the world between them into exclusive spheres of influence, trade and colonization.   The proselytization of Asia became linked to [[Portugal#Religion|Portuguese colonial policy]].

====Catholic missions in Asia====
{{main article|Catholic missions}}
Portuguese trade with Asia rapidly proved profitable from 1499 onwards, and as [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] arrived in India around 1540, the colonial government in [[Goa]] supported the mission with incentives for baptized Christians.  Later, the Church sent [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuits to China]] (1552 onwards) and to other countries in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Matthew Brockey, ''Journey to the east: The Jesuit mission to China, 1579–1724'' (Harvard University Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Županov|first= Ines G.|authorlink=Ines G. Županov| year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nix4M4dy7nQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Missionary Tropics: The Catholic Frontier in India (16th–17th centuries)|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=0-472-11490-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestant missions===
The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] unfolded in Europe in the early 16th century. For over a hundred years, occupied by their struggle with the Catholic Church, the early Protestant churches as a body were not strongly focused on missions to "heathen" lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Roy|first= Olivier|title= Holy Ignorance|year= 2010|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-231-70126-6|pages= 48–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the focus was initially more on Christian lands in the hope to spread the Protestant faith, identifying the papacy with the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walls|first=Andrew F.|date=November 2016|title=Eschatology and the Western Missionary Movement|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/10.3366/swc.2016.0155|journal=Studies in World Christianity|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=182–200|doi=10.3366/swc.2016.0155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the centuries that followed, Protestant churches began sending out missionaries in increasing numbers, spreading the proclamation of the Christian message to previously [[unreached people group|unreached people]]. In North America, missionaries to the Native Americans included [[Jonathan Edwards (theology)|Jonathan Edwards]] (1703–1758), the well-known preacher of the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] (ca 1731–1755), who in his later years retired from the very public life of his early career. He became a missionary to the [[Housatonic Native Americans]] (1751) and a staunch advocate for them against [[cultural imperialism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As European culture has been established in the midst of indigenous peoples, the cultural distance between Christians of differing cultures has been difficult to overcome.{{clarify|date=September 2014}} One early solution was the creation of segregated "praying towns" of Christian natives. This pattern of grudging acceptance of converts played out again later in [[Hawaii]] when missionaries from that same{{which|date=September 2014}} New England culture went there. In the course of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] missionaries learned the languages of the [[Amerindian]]s and devised [[writing system]]s for them. Then they preached to indigenous people in those languages ([[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Guarani language|Guarani]], [[Nahuatl]]) instead of Spanish, to keep Indians away from "sinful" whites. An extreme case of segregation occurred in the [[Guarani people|Guarani]] [[Jesuit Reductions|Reductions]], a theocratic semi-independent region established by the [[Jesuits]] in the region of the future Paraguay between the early 17th century and 1767.

From 1732 onwards the [[Moravian Church]] began sending out missionaries.

Around 1780, an indigent [[Baptist]] cobbler named [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] began reading about [[James Cook]]'s travels voyages in Polynesia. His interest grew to a furious sort of "backwards homesickness", inspiring him to obtain Baptist orders, and eventually to write his famous 1792 pamphlet, "[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11449/11449-h/11449-h.htm An Enquiry into the Obligation of Christians to use Means for the Conversion of Heathen]". Far from a dry book of theology, Carey's work used the best available geographic and ethnographic data to map and count the number of people who had never heard the Gospel. It inspired a movement that has grown with increasing speed from his day to the present.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In the United States, the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] (ABCFM) was chartered in 1812.

Protestant missionaries from the Anglican and Lutheran and Presbyterian traditions starting arriving in what was then the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the first half of the 19th Century. This eventually let to the creation of what are today the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and the Holy Land]] and the see of the [[Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Duane Alexander|title=The Installation of a Bishop in Jerusalem|journal=Anglican and Episcopal History|date=December 2007|volume=76|issue=4|pages=549–554|url=https://www.academia.edu/1502825/The_Installation_of_a_Bishop_in_Jerusalem_The_Cathedral_Church_of_St_George_the_Martyr_15_April_2007|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it was during this time that the [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]] started their missionary activity in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Duane Alexander|title=Renegotiating the Boundaries of Evangelicalism in Jerusalem's Christian Quarter|journal=Anglican and Episcopal History|date=June 2010|volume=79|issue=2|pages=185–188|url=https://www.academia.edu/1502818/Renegotiating_the_Boundaries_of_Evangelicalism_in_Jerusalems_Christian_Quarter_Christian_and_Missionary_Alliance_Church_Jerusalem_12_February_2010|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American "[[Hard-shell Baptists]]", "[[Anti-Mission Baptists]]", or "Old School Baptists" adhering to strict [[Calvinist]] rejected all mission boards, Bible [[Tract (literature)|tract]] societies, and [[temperance societies]] as nonbiblical.  The mainstream of the Baptist denomination, however, supported missionary work.

[[Thomas Coke (Methodist)|Thomas Coke]], (1747–1814) the first [[bishop]] of the [[United Methodist Church|American Methodists]], was  "the Father of Methodist Missions". After spending time in the newly formed United States of America strengthening the infant [[Methodist]] Church alongside [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] colleague [[Francis Asbury]], the British-born Coke left for mission work. During his time in America, Coke worked vigorously to increase Methodist support of Christian missions and of raising up mission workers. Coke died while on a mission trip to India, but his legacy among Methodists – his passion for missions – continues.

===China===
[[File:Open Air Preaching WB.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Missionary preaching in China using [[The Wordless Book]]]]

A wave of missions, starting in the early 1850s, targeted inland areas, led by [[Hudson Taylor]] (1832–1905) with his [[China Inland Mission]] (1865– ). Taylor was later supported by [[Henry Grattan Guinness]] (1835–1910) who founded (1883) [[Cliff College]], which continues {{as of | 2014 | lc = on}} to train and equip for local and global mission.

The missions inspired by Taylor and Guinness have collectively been called{{by whom|date=September 2014}} "[[faith missions]]" and owe much to the ideas and example of [[Anthony Norris Groves]] (1795–1853). Taylor, a thorough-going [[psychological nativism|nativist]], offended the missionaries of his era by wearing Chinese clothing and speaking Chinese at home. His books, speaking, and examples led to the formation of numerous inland missions and of the [[Student Volunteer Movement]] (SVM, founded in 1886), which from 1850 to about 1950 sent nearly 10,000 missionaries to inland areas, often at great personal sacrifice. Many early SVM missionaries traveling to areas with endemic tropical diseases left with their belongings packed in a coffin, aware that 80% of them would die within two years.

===British Empire===
In the 18th century, and even more so in the 19th century, missionaries based in Britain saw the Empire as a fertile field for proselytizing for Christianity. All the main denominations were involved, including the Church of England, the Presbyterians of Scotland, and the Nonconformists. Much of the enthusiasm emerged from the Evangelical revival.  Within the [[Church of England]], the [[Church Mission Society]] (CMS) originated in 1799&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Ward|first= Kevin|title= A History of Global Anglicanism|year= 2006|publisher= Cambridge U Press|location= New York|page = 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to undertake activity all around the world, including in what became known as "the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Thorne|title=Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth-Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WHb8hB6hiIC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1999|publisher=Stanford University Press, ch 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Porter, ''Religion versus Empire?: British Protestant Missionaries and Overseas Expansion, 1700–1914'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the American Revolution, Anglican and Methodist missionaries were active in the 13 Colonies. The Methodists, led by [[George Whitefield]], were the most successful and after the revolution and entirely distinct American Methodist denomination emerged that became the largest Protestant denomination in the new United States.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Noll, ''The Rise of Evangelicalism: The Age of Edwards, Whitefield and the Wesleys'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  A major problem for colonial officials was the demand of the Church of England to set up an American bishop; this was strongly opposed by most of the Americans had never happened. Increasingly colonial officials took a neutral position on religious matters, even in those colonies such as Virginia where the Church of England was officially established, but in practice controlled by laymen in the local vestries. After the Americans broke free, British officials decided to enhance the power and wealth of the Church of England in all the settler colonies, especially British North America (Canada).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Porter, "Religion, Missionary Enthusiasm, and Empire," in Porter, ed., ''Oxford History of the British Empire'' (1999) vol 3 pp 223–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Missionary societies funded their own operations that were not supervised or directed by the Colonial Office. Tensions emerged between the missionaries and the colonial officials. The latter feared that missionaries might stir up trouble or encourage the natives to challenge colonial authority. In general, colonial officials were much more comfortable with working with the established local leadership, including the native religions, rather than introducing the divisive force of Christianity. This proved especially troublesome in India, were very few local elites were attracted to Christianity. In Africa, especially, the missionaries made many converts. Of the 21st century there were more Anglicans in Nigeria than in England.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Etherington, ed. ''Missions and Empire'' (Oxford History of the British Empire Companion Series) (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter, "Religion, Missionary Enthusiasm, and Empire,"  (1999) vol 3 ch 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Missionaries increasingly came to focus on education, medical help, and long-term modernization of the native personality to inculcate European middle-class values.  They established schools and medical clinics.   Christian missionaries played a public role, especially in promoting sanitation and public health.  Many were trained as physicians, or took special courses in public health and tropical medicine at Livingstone College, London.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Johnson, "Colonial Mission and Imperial Tropical Medicine: Livingstone College, London, 1893–1914," ''Social History of Medicine'' (2010) 23#3 pp 549–566.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 1870===
By the 1870s Protestant missions around the world generally acknowledged the long-term material goal was the formation of independent, self-governing, self-supporting, self-propagating churches.  The rise of nationalism in the Third World provoked challenges from critics who complained that the missionaries were teaching Western ways, and ignoring the indigenous culture.  The [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China in 1898 involved very large scale attacks on Christian missions and their converts.  The First World War diverted resources, and pulled most Germans out of missionary work when that country lost its empire.  The worldwide Great Depression of the 1930s was a major blow to funding mission activities.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Fahlbusch, ed.  The Encyclopedia of Christianity (1999) 1:301, 416–7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, the [[Edinburgh Missionary Conference]] was presided over by active SVM and YMCA leader (and future [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient) [[John R. Mott]], an [[United Methodist Church|American Methodist]] layperson, the conference reviewed the state of evangelism, Bible translation, mobilization of church support, and the training of indigenous leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gairdner|first=Temple|title=Echoes from Edinburgh 1910|year=1910|publisher=Anderson &amp; Ferrier|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Looking to the future, conferees worked on strategies for worldwide evangelism and cooperation. The conference not only established greater ecumenical cooperation in missions, but also essentially launched the modern [[Christian ecumenism|ecumenical movement]].

The next wave of missions was started by two missionaries, [[Cameron Townsend]] and [[Donald McGavran]], around 1935. These men realized that although earlier missionaries had reached geographic areas, there were numerous ethnographic groups that were isolated by language, or class from the groups that missionaries had reached. Cameron formed [[Wycliffe Bible Translators]] to translate the Bible into native languages. McGavran concentrated on finding bridges to cross the class and cultural barriers in places like India, which has upwards of 4,600 peoples, separated by a combination of language, culture, and caste. Despite democratic reforms, caste and class differences are still fundamental in many cultures.

An equally important dimension of missions strategy is the indigenous method of nationals reaching their own people. In Asia this wave of missions was pioneered by men like Dr G. D. James of [[Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James-Nathan|first=Violet|title=That Asia May Know: Perspectives on Missions in Asia|publisher=Asia Evangelistic Fellowship International|isbn=0-646-39763-X|pages=8–43|edition=40th Anniversary Commemorative|editor=Jonathan James and Malcolm Tan|chapter=One|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rev Theodore Williams of India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Evangelical Mission|url=http://www.iemoutreach.org/|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[David Yonggi Cho|Dr David Cho]] of [[South Korea|Korea]]. The "two thirds missions movement" as it is referred to, is today a major force in missions.

Most modern missionaries and missionary societies have repudiated cultural imperialism, and elected to focus on spreading the gospel and translating the Bible.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Sometimes, missionaries have been vital in preserving and documenting the culture of the peoples among whom they live.

Often, missionaries provide welfare and health services, as a [[good deed]] or to make friends with the locals. Thousands of schools, orphanages, and hospitals have been established by missions. One service provided by missionaries was the ''Each one, teach one'' [[literacy]] program begun by Dr. [[Frank Laubach]] in the [[Philippines]] in 1935. The program has since spread around the world and brought literacy to the least enabled members of many societies.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

During this period missionaries, especially [[evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] missionaries, witnessed a substantial increase in the number of conversions of Muslims to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Duane Alexander|title=Woven in the Weakness of the Changing Body: the Genesis of World Islamic Christianity|journal=CTFC|date=February 2010|volume=2|url=http://www.nazarethseminary.org/datadir/en-events/ev61/files/Duane%20A%20Miller%20Genesis-of-World-Islamic-Christianity.pdf|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview published in 2013 a leader of a key missionary agency focused on Muslims claimed that the world is living in a "day of salvation for Muslims everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blincoe|first=Bob|author2=Duane Alexander Miller|title=The Day of Salvation for Muslims Everywhere: an interview with Bob Blincoe|journal=Global Missiology|date=January 2013|volume=10|issue=2|url=https://www.academia.edu/2348120/The_Day_of_Salvation_for_Muslims_Everywhere_an_interview_with_Bob_Blincoe|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "mission" was historically often applied to the building, the "[[mission (station)|mission station]]" in which the missionary lives or works. In some colonies, these mission stations became a focus of settlement of displaced or formerly [[nomad]]ic people. Particularly in rural Australia, [[mission (station)|missions]] have become localities or [[ghetto]]es on the edges of towns which are home to many [[Indigenous Australians]].
The word may be seen as derogatory when used in this context.

==Contemporary concepts of mission==
===Sending and receiving nations===
Major nations not only send and fund missionaries abroad, but also receive them from other countries. In 2010, the United States sent out 127,000 missionaries, while 32,400 came to the United States. Brazil was second, sending out 34,000, and receiving 20,000. France sent out 21,000 and received 10,000. Britain sent out 15,000 and received 10,000. India sent out 10,000 and received 8000. Other major exporters included Spain at 21,000 sent out, Italy at 20,000, South Korea at 20,000, Germany at 14,000, and Canada at 8,500. Large recipient nations included Russia, receiving 20,000; Congo receiving 15,000; South Africa, 12,000; Argentina, 10,000; and Chile, 8,500. The largest sending agency in the United States was the Southern Baptist Convention, with 4,800 missionaries, plus 450 support staff working inside the United States. The annual budget is about $50,000 per year per missionary. In recent years, however, the Southern Baptist foreign missionary operation (the International Mission Board) has operated at a deficit, and it is cutting operations by 15 percent. It is encouraging older missionaries to retire and return to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara Audi, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/cash-strapped-missionaries-get-a-new-calling-home-1445765402?alg=y "Cash-Strapped Missionaries Get a New Calling: Home—Years of overspending to support Southern Baptist missionary work has led to budget crunch," ''Wall Street Journal '' 25 October, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern missionary methods and doctrines among conservative Protestants===
The [[First International Congress on World Evangelization|Lausanne Congress]] of 1974, birthed a movement that supports evangelical mission among non-Christians and nominal Christians. It regards "mission" as that which is designed "to form a viable indigenous [[Christian Church|church]]-planting and world changing movement." This definition is motivated by a [[Christian theology|theologically]] imperative theme of the [[Bible]] to make God known, as outlined in the [[Great Commission]]. The definition is claimed to summarize the acts of [[Jesus]]' ministry, which is taken as a model motivation for all ministries.

This Christian missionary movement seeks to implement churches after the pattern of the first century Apostles. The process of forming [[disciple (Christianity)|disciple]]s is necessarily social. "Church" should be understood in the widest sense, as a body of believers of Christ rather than simply a building. In this view, even those who are already culturally Christian must be "evangelized".

Church planting by cross-cultural missionaries leads to the establishment of self-governing, self-supporting and self-propagating communities of believers. This is the famous "three-self" formula formulated by [[Henry Venn (Church Missionary Society)|Henry Venn]] of the London [[Church Missionary Society]] in the 19th century. Cross-cultural missionaries are persons who accept church-planting duties to evangelize people outside their culture, as Christ commanded in the [[Great Commission]] ({{bibleref|Matthew|28:18–20}}, {{bibleref|Mark|16:15–18}}).

The objective of these missionaries is to give an understandable presentation of their beliefs with the hope that people will choose to following the teaching of Jesus Christ and live their lives as His disciples. As a matter of strategy, many [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians around the world now focus on what they call the "10/40 window", a band of countries between [[10th parallel north|10]] and [[40th parallel north|40 degrees north]] [[latitude]] and reaching from western Africa through Asia. Christian missions strategist [[Luis Bush]] pinpointed the need for a major focus of evangelism in the "[[10/40 Window]]", a phrase he coined in his presentation at the missionary conference [[Second International Congress on World Evangelization|Lausanne 1989]] in Manila. Sometimes referred to as the "Resistant Belt", it is an area that includes 35% of the world's land mass, 90% of the world's poorest peoples and 95% of those who have yet to hear anything about Christianity.

Modern mission techniques are sufficiently refined that within ten to fifteen years, most indigenous churches are locally pastored, managed, taught, self-supporting and evangelizing. The process can be substantially faster if a preexisting [[Bible translation|translation of the Bible]] and higher pastoral education are already available, perhaps left over from earlier, less effective missions.

One strategy is to let indigenous cultural groups decide to adopt Christian doctrines and benefits, when (as in most cultures) such major decisions are normally made by groups. In this way, opinion leaders in the groups can persuade much or most of the groups to convert. When combined with training in discipleship, church planting and other modern missionary [[doctrine]], the result is an accelerating, self-propelled conversion of large portions of the culture.

A typical modern mission is a co-operative effort by many different ministries, often including several coordinating ministries, such as the [[Faith2Share]] network, often with separate funding sources. One typical effort proceeded as follows:

# A missionary radio group recruits, trains and broadcasts in the main dialect of the target culture's language. Broadcast content is carefully adapted to avoid [[syncretism]] yet help the Christian Gospel seem like a native, normal part of the target culture. Broadcast content often includes news, music, entertainment and education in the language, as well as purely Christian items.
# Broadcasts might advertise programs, inexpensive radios (possibly spring-wound), and a literature ministry that sells a Christian mail-order correspondence course at nominal costs. The literature ministry is key, and is normally a separate organization from the radio ministry. Modern literature missions are shifting to web-based content where it makes sense (as in Western Europe and Japan).
# When a person or group completes a correspondence course, they are invited to contact a church-planting missionary group from (if possible) a related cultural group. The church-planting ministry is usually a different ministry from either the literature or radio ministries. The church-planting ministry usually requires its missionaries to be fluent in the target language, and trained in modern church-planting techniques.
# The missionary then leads the group to start a church. Churches planted by these groups are usually a group that meets in a house. The object is the minimum organization that can perform the required character development and spiritual growth. Buildings, complex ministries and other expensive items are mentioned, but deprecated until the group naturally achieves the size and budget to afford them. The crucial training is how to become a Christian (by faith in Jesus Christ) and then how to set up a church (meet to study the Bible, and perform communion and worship), usually in that order.
# A new generation of churches is created, and the growth begins to accelerate geometrically. Frequently, daughter churches are created only a few months after a church's creation. In the fastest-growing Christian movements, the pastoral education is "pipelined", flowing in a just-in-time fashion from the central churches to daughter churches. That is, planting of churches does not wait for the complete training of pastors.

The most crucial part of church planting is selection and training of leadership. Classically, leadership training required an expensive stay at a seminary, a Bible college. Modern church planters deprecate this because it substantially slows the growth of the church without much immediate benefit. Modern mission doctrines replace the [[seminary]] with programmed curricula or (even less expensive) books of discussion questions, and access to real theological books. The materials are usually made available in a major trading language in which most native leaders are likely to be fluent. In some cases, the materials can be adapted for oral use.

It turns out that new pastors' practical needs for [[theology]] are well addressed by a combination of practical procedures for [[Christian Church|church]] planting, discussion in small groups, and motivated Bible-based study from diverse theological texts. As a culture's church's wealth increases, it will naturally form classic seminaries on its own.

Another related mission is [[Bible translation]]. The above-mentioned literature has to be translated. Missionaries actively experiment with advanced [[SIL International|linguistic techniques]] to speed translation and literacy. Bible translation not only speeds a church's growth by aiding self-training, but it also assures that Christian information becomes a permanent part of the native culture and literature. Some ministries also use modern recording techniques to reach groups with audio that could not be soon reached with literature.

===Among Roman Catholics===
For Catholics, “Missions” is the term given to those particular undertakings by which the heralds of the [[Gospel]], sent out by the [[Catholic_Church|Church]] and going forth into the whole world, carry out the task of preaching the Gospel and planting the Church among peoples or groups who do not yet believe in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Decree on the Mission Activity of the Church: Ad Gentes. (Para. 6)  In Vatican II Documents, (1965), Vatican City: Libreria Editrice Vaticana.
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vatican II]] made a deep impact on Catholic missions around the world. The Church's relations to non-Christian religions like [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] were revisited.

A steep decline in the number of people entering the priesthood and religious life in the West has made the Church look towards laity more and more. Communities like [[Opus Dei]] arose to meet this need.

[[Inculturation]] increasingly became a key topic of missiological reflection for Catholics. Inculturation is understood as the meeting of the Christian message with a community in their cultural context.

[[Liberation Theology]] and [[liturgical reform]] have also been important in forming and influencing the mission of the Catholic Church in the 20th and 21st Centuries.

In relation to mission, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] has made the re-evangelization of Europe and North America a priority in his own ministry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Tito|title=Benedict Opens New Evangelization of Europe and America Office|url=http://the-american-catholic.com/2010/06/28/benedict-opens-new-evangelization-of-europe-and-america-office/|accessdate=18 January 2013|newspaper=The American Catholic|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; even while the upper leadership of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and the college of cardinals has more members from Latin America, Africa, and Asia than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmo|first=Rocco|title=B16's October Surprise|url=http://whispersintheloggia.blogspot.co.il/2012/10/b16s-october-surprise-pope-calls-shock.html|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key documents on mission for Catholics during this period are ''[[Evangelii nuntiandi]]'' by [[Pope Paul VI]] and ''[[Redemptoris missio]]'' by [[Pope John Paul II]].

=== Publishing of books as mission ===
Christian mission organisations have long depended on the printed word as a channel through which to do mission.  At times when countries have been "closed" to Christians, great efforts have been made to smuggle Bibles and other literature into those countries. Brother Andrew, the founder of Open Doors, started smuggling Bibles into communist countries in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opendoorsuk.org/about/our_history/|title=Open Doors history|last=Ireland|first=Open Doors UK &amp;|website=www.opendoorsuk.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Operation Mobilisation was established in 1957 by George Verwer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uk.om.org/om-world/about-om|title=About Operation Mobilisation|last=Mobilisation|first=Operation|work=Operation Mobilisation|access-date=2017-06-15|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Christian publishers, such as Plough Publishing, provide free books to people in the UK and US as a form of mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.plough.com/en/about-us|title=About Us|website=Plough|language=en|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible Society translates and prints Bibles, in an attempt to reach every country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/|title=Home|website=www.biblesociety.org.uk|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Podcasting as mission ===
The internet now provides Christian mission organisations a convent way of reaching people in the form of [[Podcast|podcasts]].  Podcasts provide a way of dissemination for a message that has potential to endanger the recipient, since it is very hard to track who has downloaded a specific podcast.  An example of this is the Crescent Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crescentproject.org/podcast/|title=Podcast — Crescent Project|website=Crescent Project|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other podcasts, such as the Life Together podcast&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/bruderhof|title=Bruderhof Communities|website=SoundCloud|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, The Sacred, and Harvest are aimed at both non-Christians and Christians in the home country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.harvest.org/watch-and-listen/podcasts|title=Podcasts - Harvest: Greg Laurie|work=Harvest: Greg Laurie|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Criticism==

===Westernization===
Objections to missionary work among isolated, indigenous populations involve the claim that the goal of mission is to [[Westernize]] them. Such claims have been raised by indigenous rights groups organizations, such as [[Friends of Peoples Close to Nature]] and [[Survival International]].

===Communicating diseases===
Missionaries, along with other travelers, brought diseases into local populations. [[Smallpox]], [[measles]], even the [[common cold]], have been blamed on their arrivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

David Igler of the [[University of California, Irvine]], includes missionary activity as a cause of spreading germs. However, he says that commercial traders were the main agents of disease.
{{quotation|... other diseases arrived on non-commercial voyages; missionary activities certainly spread germs, and Spanish conquests had dispersed deadly germs in parts of the Americas and Pacific prior to the late eighteenth century. Yet, for the period between the 1770s and the 1840s, trading vessels were the main agents of disease, creating in the Pacific what Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie has called a "paroxysm" of the "microbian unification of the world." By 1850, the microbes of Europe, Asia, and Africa circulated in almost every Pacific population.&lt;ref name = "Igler" &gt;{{Cite journal

===Statistical patterns===
Political scientist Robert Woodberry uses statistics to argue that conversionary Protestants were a crucial catalyst in spreading religious liberty, education, and democracy. He shows that statistically the prevalence of such missionaries account for half of the variance in democracy in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Oceania.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Woodberry, "The missionary roots of liberal democracy," ''American Political Science Review''  106.2 (2012): 244–274 [https://www.academia.edu/2128659 / online]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 ''Christianity Today'' article, he remarks, "Areas where Protestant missionaries had a significant presence in the past are on average more economically developed today, with comparatively better health, lower infant mortality, lower corruption, greater literacy, higher educational attainment (especially for women), and more robust membership in nongovernmental associations."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/missions-rescuing-from-hell-and-renewing-the-world&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and Christian missionaries==
{{cquote|"''This proselytization will mean no peace in the world. Conversions are harmful to India. If I had the power and could legislate I should certainly stop all proselytizing ... It pains me to have to say that the Christian missionaries as a body, with honorable exceptions, have actively supported a system which has impoverished, enervated and demoralized a people considered to be among the gentlest and most civilized on earth''".&lt;ref&gt;''The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' Volume 24, p. 476 Note: This quote isn't in this volume. In fact the volume only contains 474 pages; volume 64 p.20 has the first sentence only:''This proselytization will mean no peace in the world''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In India, Hindu organisations such as the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] assert that most conversions undertaken by zealous evangelicals occur due to compulsion, inducement or fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.organiser.org/11May2003/p14.htm Why Anti-Conversion Law needed]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indian state of [[Tripura]], the government has alleged financial and weapons-smuggling connections between [[Baptist]] missionaries and rebel groups such as the [[National Liberation Front of Tripura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/south_asia/717775.stm |title=Church backing Tripura rebels | publisher=BBC News | date=18 April 2000 | accessdate=August 9, 2007 |author=Subir Bhaumik }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The accused [[Tripura Baptist Christian Union]] is a member body of the [[Baptist World Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bwanet.org/default.aspx?pid=437] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415042516/http://www.bwanet.org/default.aspx?pid=437 |date=April 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"In mid-May, the Vatican was also co-sponsoring a meeting about how some religious groups abuse liberties by proselytizing, or by evangelizing in aggressive or deceptive ways. Iraq ... has become an open field for foreigners looking for fresh converts. Some Catholic Church leaders and aid organizations have expressed concern about new Christian groups coming in and luring Iraqis to their churches with offers of cash, clothing, food or jobs.... Reports of aggressive proselytism and reportedly forced conversions in mostly Hindu India have fueled religious tensions and violence there and have prompted some regional governments to pass laws banning proselytism or religious conversion.... Sadhvi Vrnda Chaitanya, a Hindu monk from southern India, told CNS that India's poor and uneducated are especially vulnerable to coercive or deceptive methods of evangelization.... Aid work must not hide any ulterior motives and avoid exploiting vulnerable people like children and the disabled, she said."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=19906 |title=Legislating conversions: Weighing the message vs. the person |publisher=Catholic Online |author=Carol Glatz |date=May 19, 2006 | accessdate=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview with Outlook Magazine, Sadhvi Vrnda Chaitanya said "If the Vatican could understand that every religious and spiritual tradition is as sacred as Christianity, and that they have a right to exist without being denigrated or extinguished, it will greatly serve the interests of dialogue, mutual respect, and peaceful coexistence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20061002&amp;fname=The+Vatican&amp;sid=1&amp;pn=2 |title=Father Complex |author=Seema Sirohi |date=October 2, 2006 |publisher=OutlookIndia.com | accessdate=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aid and evangelism===
While there is a general agreement among most major aid organizations not to mix aid with proselyting, others see disasters as a useful opportunity to spread the word. One such an occurrence was the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|tsunami that devastated parts of Asia on December 26, 2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jan/16/tsunami2004.internationalaidanddevelopment1 |title=Religious aid groups try to convert victims |date=January 16, 2005 | accessdate=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"This (disaster) is one of the greatest opportunities God has given us to share his love with people," said K.P. Yohannan, president of the Texas-based Gospel for Asia. In an interview, Yohannan said his 14,500 "native missionaries" in India, Sri Lanka and the Andaman Islands are giving survivors Bibles and booklets about "how to find hope in this time through the word of God." In Krabi, Thailand, a Southern Baptist church had been "praying for a way to make inroads" with a particular ethnic group of fishermen, according to Southern Baptist relief coordinator Pat Julian. Then came the tsunami, "a phenomenal opportunity" to provide ministry and care, Julian told the Baptist Press news service.... Not all evangelicals agree with these tactics. "It's not appropriate in a crisis like this to take advantage of people who are hurting and suffering", said the Rev. Franklin Graham, head of Samaritan's Purse and son of evangelist Billy Graham."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwrn.org/articles/12123/?&amp;place=india&amp;section=evangelicals |title=In Asia, some Christian groups spread supplies – and the word |publisher=Knight-Ridder Newspapers |date=January 12, 2005 | accessdate=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian Science Monitor echoes these concerns... ''"'I think evangelists do this out of the best intentions, but there is a responsibility to try to understand other faith groups and their culture,''' says Vince Isner, director of FaithfulAmerica.org, a program of the National Council of Churches USA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/ngos/credib/2005/0131disasteraid.htm |title=Disaster Aid Furthers Fears of Proselytizing |author=Jane Lampman |publisher=Christian Science Monitor |date=January 31, 2005 | accessdate=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] has made it easier for U.S. faith-based groups and missionary societies to tie aid and church together.
:''For decades, US policy has sought to avoid intermingling government programs and religious proselytizing. The aim is both to abide by the Constitution's prohibition against a state religion and to ensure that aid recipients don't forgo assistance because they don't share the religion of the provider.... But many of those restrictions were removed by Bush in a little-noticed series of executive orders – a policy change that cleared the way for religious groups to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars in additional government funding. It also helped change the message American aid workers bring to many corners of the world, from emphasizing religious neutrality to touting the healing powers of the Christian God.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/10/08/bush_brings_faith_to_foreign_aid/ |title=Bush brings faith to foreign aid |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=October 8, 2006 | accessdate=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian counter-claims===
Missionaries say that the government in India has passed anti-conversion laws in several states that are supposedly meant to prevent conversions from "force or allurement," but are primarily used, they say, to persecute and criminalize voluntary conversion due to the government's broad definition of "force and allurement." Any gift received from a Christian in exchange for, or with the intention of, conversion is considered allurement. [[Voice of the Martyrs]] reports that aid-workers claim that they are being hindered from reaching people with much needed services as a result of this persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.persecution.com/members/countryMap/index.cfm?action=countryView&amp;countryID=69 |title=Country Map – India |publisher=Persecution.com | accessdate=August 7, 2007}} (website requires anonymous creation of a username and password account to be able to view)&lt;/ref&gt; Alan de Lastic, Roman Catholic archbishop of New Delhi states that claims of forced conversion are false.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19990103/0035085.html |title=Indian Express |access-date=2013-04-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412110745/http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19990103/0035085.html |archive-date=2009-04-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2112">'''Christopher Airay''' (1601 – 18 October 1670) was an English preacher and a pioneer in English logic.

==Life==
Airay was born at [[Clifton, Cumbria|Clifton]] in [[Westmorland|Westmoreland]] in 1600/01. [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]] states that he became a student in [[The Queen's College, Oxford]] and earned a Master of Arts. In 1627 he was elected fellow. About this time he entered into holy orders, according to the statutes of the house, and became a preacher. He was created B.D. in 1642.

Airay was presented to the living of [[Milford, Hampshire]]; where he died on [[St. Luke's Day]], 1670, and was buried in the chancel of his church. His epitaph read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Memoriæ sacrum Christopheri Airay, S. T. Bac. olim Coll. Reg. Oxon. socii et hujus ecclesiæ Vicarii vigilantissimi, viri summæ integritatis, judicii acerrimi et ingenii literarum omnium capacis; qui difficillime seculo inter æstuantes rerum fluctus clavum rectum tenuit. Mortalitatem tandem exuit 18 Oct. annos natus 69.''&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

==Works==
Whilst still at the university he published anonymously his one known book, viz.: ‘Fascicvlvs Præceptorvm Logicorvm in gratiam juventutis academicæ compositus et nunc primum typis donatus. Oxoniæ excudebat Gvlielmus Tvrner Academiæ Typographus. An. D. 1628. Cum Priuilegio’ (pp.&amp;nbsp;224). The printer signs the ‘Præfatio.’ The following are the main headings: Lib. 1, De Prædicabilibus; 2. De Anteprædicamentis; 3, De Propositione; 4. De Demonstratione; 5. De Syllogismo Topico; 6. De Syllogismo Sophistico. Logic is mixed with metaphysics.  A second edition appeared in 1660.

Dashed lines indicate sourcing that isn't visible to the final reviewer.  In both cases, one original source (top) appears to the final reviewer (bottom) as two independent sources]]

'''Circular reporting''' or '''false confirmation''' is a situation in [[source criticism]] where a piece of information appears to come from multiple independent sources, but in reality comes from only one source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/caj/documents/vol_11/iss_2/CAJ_Vol11.2_12_e.pdf|title=The Challenge of Centralized Control Faced by the Intelligence Function in Afghanistan|publisher=Canadian Army Journal|date=Summer 2008|author1=Marcus Sterzer, CD|author2=Patrick McDuff B.A.|author3=Jacek Flasz|lastauthoramp=yes|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305201954/http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/caj/documents/vol_11/iss_2/CAJ_Vol11.2_12_e.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MotherJones"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2008/06/8595_three_days_in_r.html|title=The Cocktail Napkin Plan for Regime Change in Iran|date=June 2008|publisher=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the problem happens mistakenly through sloppy intelligence gathering practices. However, at other times the situation can be intentionally contrived by the original source as a way of reinforcing the widespread belief in its information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=I Solemnly Swear|author1=Micheal T. Hurley |author2=Kenton V. Smith |ISBN=0-595-29947-4|chapter=8|page=128|quote=Circular reporting occurs when what is reported is fed back to the originator in revised fashion which makes it difficult to objectively view the end product until you can trace back the sources to determine where the original information actually came from. Pan Am would eventually try to play that game by trying to introduce into court news reports that they themselves had a hand in producing.}} [https://books.google.com/books?q=%22Circular+reporting+occurs+when+what+is+reported+is+fed+back+to+the+originator+in+revised+fashion+which+makes+it+difficult+to+objectively+view+the+end+product+until+you+can+trace+back+the+sources+to+determine+where+the+original+information+actually+came+from.+Pan+Am+would+eventually+try+to+play+that+game+by+trying+to+introduce+into+court+news+reports+that+they+themselves+had+a+hand+in+producing.%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books Google Book search], retrieved on 23 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem occurs in a variety of fields, including [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence gathering]],&lt;ref name="MotherJones" /&gt; [[media echo chamber|journalism]], and scholarly [[research]]. It is of particular concern in [[military intelligence]] because the original source has a higher likelihood of wanting to pass on misinformation, and because the chain of reporting is [[fog of war|more prone to being obscured]]. The case of the 2002 [[Niger uranium forgeries]] was a classic instance of circular reporting by intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/17/nation/na-niger17|title=2006-02-17|publisher=Los Angeles Times|quote="This became a classic case of circular reporting," said a U.S. intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to reporters. "It seemed like we were hearing it from lots of places. People didn't realize it was the same bad information coming in different doors." | first1=Bob | last1=Drogin | first2=Tom | last2=Hamburger | date=2006-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples involving Wikipedia==
[[File:Relationship between Wikipedia and the press.svg|thumb|Diagram illustrating circular reporting by Wikipedia and the press]]
[[Wikipedia]] is sometimes criticized for being used as a source of circular reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/media/news/2009/05/wikipedia-hoax-reveals-limits-of-journalists-research.ars |title=Wikipedia hoax points to the limits of journalists' research |publisher=Ars Technica |last=Timmer |first=John |date=May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia advises researchers and journalists to [[WP:Citing Wikipedia|be wary of, and generally avoid, using Wikipedia as a direct source]], and instead focus on verifiable information found in an article's [[WP:Citing sources|cited references]].

In the following examples, false claims were propagated on Wikipedia and in news sources because of circular reporting. [[Randall Munroe|Randall Monroe]], in his comic [[xkcd]], coined the term "citogenesis" to describe this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://xkcd.com/978/|title=xkcd: Citogenesis|website=xkcd.com|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Wikipedia and [[The Northern Echo]]: In January 2014 a statement was anonymously added to the Wikipedia page on UK comedian/broadcaster [[Dave Gorman]] stating that "he had taken a career break for a sponsored hitch-hike around the Pacific Rim countries". When this was questioned, an article published at a later date (September 2014) in ''The Northern Echo'', a daily regional newspaper in North East England was cited as evidence. The falsity of the original claim was confirmed by Gorman in an episode of his UK TV show [[Modern Life is Goodish]] (first broadcast 22 November 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hardwick|first1=Viv|title=Mears sets his sights on UK|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20140929214806/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/entertainment/11460855.Mears_sets_his_sights_on_UK/|accessdate=30 August 2017|work=[[The Northern Echo]]|date=9 September 2014|quote=He once hitchhiked around the Pacific Rim countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Codex Cumanicus 58.jpg|thumb|right|A page with a parrot from "Codex Cumanicus"]]
The '''Codex Cumanicus''' is a [[Linguistics|linguistic]] manual of the [[Middle Ages]], designed to help [[Catholic]] [[missionaries]] communicate with the [[Cumans]], a nomadic [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people. It is currently housed in the [[Biblioteca Marciana|Library of St. Mark]], in [[Venice]] (Cod. Mar. Lat. DXLIX).

==Origin and content==

The [[Codex]] likely developed over time. [[Mercantile]], political, and religious leaders, particularly in [[Hungary]], sought effective communication with the [[Cumans]] as early as the mid-11th century. As [[Italy|Italian]] [[city-states]], such as [[Genoa]], began to establish trade posts and colonies along the [[Black Sea]] coastline, the need for tools to learn the [[Kipchak language]] sharply increased.

The earliest parts of the Codex are believed to have originated in the 12th or 13th century. Substantial additions were likely made over time.  The copy preserved in [[Venice]] is dated 11 July 1330 on fol. 1r (see Drimba, p.&amp;nbsp;35 and Schmieder in Schmieder/Schreiner, p.&amp;nbsp;XIII). The Codex consists of a number of independent works combined into one. 

Historians{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} generally divide it into two distinct and independent parts. The first part, 1r-55v, is a practical handbook of the Kipchak tongue, containing a glossary of words in [[vulgar Latin|vulgar]] Italo-[[Latin]] and translations into [[Persian language|Persian]] and Kipchak. This section has been styled the "Italian Part" or the "Interpreter's Book" of the Codex.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} Whether the Persian parts came through Kipchak intermediaries or whether Persian was a [[lingua franca]] for Mediterranean trade well known in [[Western Europe]] is a matter hotly debated by scholars.

The second folio, 56r-82v, is a collection of various religious texts including a translation of the [[Lord's Prayer]] and riddles in Kipchak, translated into Latin and Eastern [[Middle High German]]. This part of the Codex is referred to as the "German" or "Missionary's Book" and is believed to have been compiled by [[Germans|German]] [[Franciscans]].

The Codex is generally regarded as accurate, but it differs slightly from other sources on Kipchak language.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}}

==Riddles==

The "Cuman Riddles" (CC, 119-120; 143-148) are a crucial source for the study of early Turkic folklore. [[Andreas Tietze]] referred to them as "the earliest variants of riddle types that constitute a common heritage of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking nations." Some of these riddles reached our days practically unchanged in [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] language. See examples below.

Among the riddles in the Codex are the following excerpts:{{Full citation needed|date=April 2017}}

*''Aq küymengin avuzı yoq. Ol yumurtqa.''
:In [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]: ''Aq küymeniñ awızı joq. Ol jumırtqa'' / ''Ak küymeniń awızı jok. Ol jumırtka''
:"The white [[kibitka]] has no mouth (opening). That is the egg."

*''Kökçä ulahım kögende semirir. Ol huvun.''
:In Kazakh: ''Kökşe lağım kögende semirer. Ol qawın'' / ''Kökce lagım kögende semirer. Ol kawın''
:"my bluish kid at the tethering rope grows fat, The melon."

*''Oturğanım oba yer basqanım baqır canaq. Ol zengi.''
:In Kazakh: ''Otırğanım oba jer basqanım baqır şanaq. Ol uzengi'' / ''Otırganım oba jer baskanım bakır canak. Ol uzengi''
:"Where I sit is a hilly place. Where I tread is a copper bowl. The stirrup."

== Research ==

Philipp's research examines genetics, [[reproduction]], and [[spatial ecology]] of fishes, and the effects of [[fisheries]] interactions on these dynamics in [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. His early research examined [[centrarchid]] population genetics, gene expression, reproductive physiology,  and strategies,  heritability of fish behaviour, and life history strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, M.

Philipp's research revealed that populations of largemouth bass, ''Micropterus salmoides'', in most of North America composite a separate species from the Florida bass, ''M. floridanus'', in Florida, and that stocking programs introducing Florida bass outside their native range have detrimental genetic effects on largemouth bass populations.&lt;ref name="Philipp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philipp, D. P. Genetic implications of introducing Florida largemouth bass. Can. J. Fish Aq. Sci. 48, 58–65 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Another research program showed that angling targets individual largemouth bass with certain behavioural and physiological characteristics, and in the process can cause evolutionary change in populations including reduced parental care and reproductive success, as well as reduced angling success rates.&lt;ref name="Cooke" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philipp, D.

== Conservation Activity ==

Philipp is a co-founder and Chair of the Fisheries Conservation Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded in 2003 to promote the work of aquatic scientists, environmental professionals, and resource managers to policy makers and the public to ensure the sustainability of freshwater and marine ecosystems through well-informed management practices. Specific campaigns include: Flats Conservation, Rivers of Success, Shark Conservation, Coastal 2100, North American Black Bass Coalition, and Responsible Angling, which promote awareness and conservation for a wide range of environmentally and economically important fish species and habitats. The Foundation is also highly involved with conservation initiatives in The Bahamas, with projects including the Bahamas Flats Fishing Alliance that aims to assemble multiple stakeholders to promote the conservation of valuable flats fisheries, and The Island School Poster Series, which engages high school students in important current environmental issues.

==Criticism==
There is some evidence that vision boards may be counterproductive, since continually fantasizing about success can lead to taking fewer actions to realizing it. Thus, an "action board" is sometimes viewed as a better alternative.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-blame-game/201205/throw-away-your-vision-board-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-blame-game/201309/8-key-principles-succeed&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imagination:Leighton-Duty-1883.jpg|right|thumb|"Duty" by [[Edmund Leighton]]]]
A '''duty''' (from "due" meaning "that which is owing"; {{lang-fro|deu, did}}, past participle of ''devoir''; {{lang-la|debere, debitum}}, whence "[[debt]]") is a commitment or expectation to perform some action in general or if certain circumstances arise.  A duty may arise from a system of [[ethics]] or [[morality]], especially in an [[honor culture]]. Many duties are based created by [[law]], sometimes including a codified punishment or [[Legal liability|liability]] for non-performance. Performing one's duty may require some [[sacrifice]] of [[self-interest]].

[[Cicero]], an early Roman philosopher who discusses duty in his work “On Duty", suggests that duties can come from four different sources:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, Marcus T. De Officiis. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1913. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
# as result of being a human
# as a result of one's particular place in life (one's family, one's country, one's job)
# as a result of one's character
# as a result of one's own moral expectations for oneself

The specific duties imposed by law or culture vary considerably, depending on jurisdiction, [[religion]], and social norms.

==Civic duty==
{{Main|Civic engagement}}
Duty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Joakim |last1=Ekman |first2=Erik |last2=Amnå |title=''Political Participation and Civic Engagement: Towards A New Typology'' |journal=Youth &amp; Society (Working Paper) |page=4 |year=2009 |issue=2 |url = http://www.oru.se/PageFiles/14371/Ekman%20and%20Amnå%202009-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also often perceived as something owed to one’s country (patriotism), or to one's homeland or community. Civic duties could include:

* Obey the law
* Pay taxes
* Provide for a common defense, should the need arise
* Enroll to vote, and vote at all elections and referenda (unless there is a reasonable excuse such as a religious objection, being overseas, or illness on polling day)
* Serve on a jury, if called upon
* Go to the aid of victims of accidents and street-crime and testifying as a witness later in court
* Report contagious illnesses or pestilence to public-health authorities
* Volunteer for public services (e.g. life-saving drills)
* Donate blood periodically or when needed
* [[Duty of revolution]] against an unjust government

==Duties of employment==
Specific [[obligation]]s arise in the services performed by a [[minister (religion)|minister]] of a [[Local church|church]], by a [[soldier]], or by any [[employment|employee]] or servant.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Duty|volume=8|page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:
* [[Dereliction of duty]] is an offense in U.S. military law
* [[Duty to protect]], in medicine
* ''[[In loco parentis]]'', for schools
* [[Professional responsibility]] for lawyers

==Legal duties==
Examples of legal duties include:
* [[Duty of care]]
* [[Duty of candour]]
* [[Duty to defend]] and [[duty to settle]], in insurance
* [[Duty to rescue]]
* [[Duty to retreat]]
* [[Misprision of felony|Duty to report a felony]]
* [[Duty to vote]] (in countries with mandatory voting)
* [[Duty to warn]]
* [[Fiduciary duties]]
* Duty to care for children as [[legal guardian]] (opposite of [[child neglect]])
* Special duties created by a [[contract]]

==Filial duty==
{{see also|Filial piety}}
[[Image:Admonitions Scroll Scene 4.jpg|right|thumb|[[Admonitions Scroll#Scene 4:Lady Feng and the bear|Lady Feng and the Bear]]]]
In most cultures, children are expected to take on duties in relation to their families. This may take the form of behaving in such a way that upholds the family’s honor in the eyes of the community, entering into arranged marriages that benefit the family’s status, or caring for ailing relatives. This family-oriented sense of duty is a particularly central aspect to the teachings of Confucius, and is known as xiao, or [[filial piety]]. As such, the duties of filial piety have played an enormous role in the lives of people in eastern Asia for centuries. For example, the painting ''Lady Feng and the Bear'', from ancient China, depicts the heroic act of a consort of the emperor placing herself between her husband and a rampaging bear. This is meant to be taken as an example of admirable filial behavior. Filial piety is considered so important that in some cases, it outweighs other cardinal virtues: In a more modern example, "concerns with filial piety of the same general sort that motivate women to engage in factory work in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and elsewhere in Asia are commonly cited by Thai prostitutes as one of their primary rationales for working in the skin trade".&lt;ref&gt;Peletz, Michael Gates. Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia. Ann Arbor, MI: Association for Asian Studies, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of filial piety can be expressed in this quote from "The Analects of Confucius": "Yu Tzu said, 'It is rare for a man whose character is such that he is good as a son and obedient as a young man to have the inclination to transgress against his superiors; it is unheard of for one who has no such inclination to be inclined to start a rebellion. The gentleman devotes his efforts to the roots, for once the roots are established, the Way will grow there from. Being good as a son and obedient as a young man is, perhaps, the root of a man's character'".

==In various cultures==
Duty varies between different cultures and continents. Duty in [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]] is commonly more heavily weighted than in [[Western culture]]. According to a study done on attitudes toward family [[obligation]]:
: "Asian and Latin American adolescents possessed stronger values and greater expectations regarding their duty to assist, respect, and support their families than their peers with European backgrounds".&lt;ref&gt;Fuligni, A. J., Tseng, V. and Lam, M. (1999), Attitudes toward Family Obligations among American Adolescents with Asian, Latin American, and European Backgrounds. Child Development, 70: 1030–1044. doi: 10.1111/1467-8624.00075.&lt;/ref&gt;
The deeply rooted [[tradition]] of duty among both Asian and Latin American cultures contributes to much of the strong sense of duty that exists in comparison to western cultures. Michael Peletz discusses the concept of duty in his book ''Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia'':
: "Notions of filial duty … are commonly invoked to mobilize the loyalties, labor power, and other resources children in the ostensible interests of the household and, in some cases, those of the lineage clan as a whole. Doctrines of filial piety … attuned to them may thus be a source of great comfort and solace to the elders but they can also be experienced as stressful, repressive, or both by those who are  enjoined to honor their parents’ (and grandparents’) wishes and unspoken expectations".&lt;ref&gt;Peletz, Michael G. Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia. Ann Arbor: 	Association for Asian Studies, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[arranged marriage]] is an example of an expected duty in Asia and the [[Middle East]]. In an arranged marriage relating to duty, it is expected that the wife will move in with the husband’s family and household to raise their children. [[Patrilocal residence]] is usual; rarely does the man move in with the woman, or is the married couple allowed to start their own household and life somewhere else. They need to provide for the entire family in labor and care for the farms and family. Older generations rely heavily on the help from their children's and grandchildren's families. This form of duty is in response to keeping the [[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] of a family intact and obliging to the needs of elders.

== Criticisms of the concept ==

=== Nietzsche ===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is among the fiercest critics of the concept of duty. "What destroys a man more quickly", he asks, "than to work, think, and feel without inner necessity, without any deep personal desire, without pleasure—as a mere automaton of “duty”?" (''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', § 11)

Nietzsche claims that the task of all higher education is "to turn men into machines". The way to turn men into machines is to teach them to tolerate boredom. This is accomplished, Nietzsche says, by means of the concept of duty. (''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', “Skirmishes of an untimely man” § 9.29)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2671">'''Eero Loone''' (born 26 May 1935 in [[Tartu]]) is an [[Estonia]]n [[philosopher]]. 

He is the son of Nigolas Loone and Leida Loone. 

Eero Loone graduated from the [[Moscow State University]] in 1958 (he studied history). From 1958 to 1960, Loone worked as junior researcher at the USSR institute of Global Economy and International Relations. Since 1966, he has been lecturer of philosophy (specializing in [[practical philosophy]]) at the [[University of Tartu]] (became a [[professor]] in 1988). He became Doctor of Philosophy in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{et icon}}http://www.audentes.ee/?id=15355&lt;/ref&gt; From 1989 to 1990 Eero Loone worked at [[Clare Hall, Cambridge]] (he became lifelong member of the college&lt;ref&gt;http://www.audentes.ee/?id=15355&lt;/ref&gt;). He has been particularly influenced by [[analytical philosophy]].  Loone's views on [[Marxism]] and [[historical materialism]] have found resonance in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjtklL_z4GQC|title = The Social Philosophy of Ernest Gellner|last = Hall|first = John A.|last2 = Jarvie|first2 = Ian Charles|date = 1996-01-01|publisher = Rodopi|isbn = 9042001062|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FsvpBqLf50gC|title = Anthropology and Politics: Revolutions in the Sacred Grove|last = Gellner|first = Ernest|date = 1995-12-04|publisher = Wiley|isbn = 9780631199182|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Varoufakis, Loone's verdict (as evident in ''Soviet Marxism and Analytical Philosophies of History'') on Soviet Communism is arguably "devastating and coincides with that of many Western scholars Marxist (e.g. Alex Callinicos) and non-Marxist (e.g. Alec Nove) alike″&lt;ref&gt;[[Yanis Varoufakis]]: ''Book Review: "Soviet Marxism and Soviet Analytical Philosophies of History" by Eero Loone.'' In: ''[[Science &amp; Society]].'' 1994 ([http://www.uadphilecon.gr/UA/files/729781022..pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, Loone has been [[professor emeritus]] at the University of Tartu.    

Eero Loone is married to [[Leiki Loone]] and has two daughters: [[Piret Loone]] and [[Oudekki Loone]] (a political scientist and member of Estonian Parliament Riigikogu since 2015).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1762">'''Ethical formalism''' is a type of [[Ethics|ethical]] theory which defines moral judgments in terms of their [[logic]]al form (e.g., as "laws" or "universal prescriptions") rather than their content (e.g., as judgments about what actions will best promote human well-being). The term also often carries critical connotations. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], for example, has been criticized for defining morality in terms of the formal feature of being a "universal law", and then attempting to derive from this formal feature various concrete moral duties.

Ethical formalism is related to, but not identical to, [[Harry J. Gensler]]'s relatively recent (circa 1996) theory of [[formal ethics]].  Formal ethics is similar to ethical formalism in that it focuses on formal features of moral judgments, but is distinct in that the system of formal ethics is explicitly (and intentionally) incomplete.  Specifically, while some ethical formalist systems (e.g., arguably Kant's "universal laws") view a set of formal features as both necessary and sufficient, formal ethics views such formal features as necessary but not sufficient.

Ethical formalism is "considered as an absolutist system, if something is wrong, it is wrong all the time" (Pollock, 2004). Just the same, if something is right, it is then right all the time.

The '''Euthalian Apparatus''' is a collection of additional editorial material, such as divisions of text, lists, and summaries, to the [[New Testament]]'s [[Book of Acts]], [[Catholic epistles]], and [[Pauline epistles]]. This additional material appears at the beginnings of books, in the margin of the text, and at the ends of books, as well as in line and paragraph separations. This material is traditionally associated with the name of [[Euthalius]].

== Description ==
Euthalius divided the text of the Acts and Catholic epistles into chapters, with a summary of contents at the top of each chapter. To Euthalius were also referred a division of the Acts into 16 αναγνωσεις (''lessons'') and of the Pauline epistles into 31 sections. But these lessons are quite different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=F. H. A.|last= Scrivener|authorlink= Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener|title=[[A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament]]|publisher=[[George Bell &amp; Sons]]|location=London|year=1894|volume=1|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2013}} Euthalius prepared also the text of the Acts and Epistles in which text is written [[Stichometry|stichometrically]].&lt;ref name = Waltz&gt;Robert Waltz, [http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/Divisions.html#Euth ''Euthalian Apparatus'', in: ''Encyclopedia of Textual Criticism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

To the Euthalian Apparatus belong: a chronology of the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]], the martyrdom of Paul, a list of places at which the Epistles were thought to be written, and the names associated with Paul in the headings to the Epistles.&lt;ref name = Ehrman&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]] &amp; [[Bart D. Ehrman]], ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The quotations from the Old Testament cited in the Pauline epistles are numbered and catalogued in a list.&lt;ref name = Waltz/&gt; Overall, the Apparatus is a collection of varied aids for the reader.&lt;ref name = Ehrman/&gt;

The Euthalian Apparatus is contained in numerous manuscripts: [[Codex Mutinensis]], [[Codex Basilensis A. N. IV. 2]], [[Codex Argenteus]], [[Minuscule 3]], [[Minuscule 5|5]], [[Minuscule 6|6]], [[Minuscule 35|35]], [[Minuscule 38|38]], and many other medieval manuscripts of the New Testament.

== Dating ==
The Euthalian apparatus has variously been dated to between the 4th and 7th centuries.&lt;ref name = Marchand&gt;Marchand, James, 1956. "The Gothic Evidence for 'Euthalian Matter,'" in ''Harvard Theological Review'', vol. 49 no. 3, pp. 159-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Marchand]] argued that the Euthalian apparatus probably dated to the first half of the 4th century, arguing that the original must precede its incorporation into [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translations.&lt;ref name = Marchand/&gt;

The Greek texts do not include the Euthalian apparatus until relatively late, but Armenian and Syriac texts incorporated it by the late 5th or early 6th century, with Gothic texts including it by the early/mid 6th century.&lt;ref name = Marchand/&gt; The Greek [[Codex Coislinianus]] includes it in the 6th century. James Marchand argued that either [[Ulfilas|Wulfila/Ulfilas]] had incorporated the Euthalian matter into the Gothic text in the mid 4th century, or Sunnia and Frethela had done so in the early 5th century, with Wulfila/Ulfilas being more likely.&lt;ref name = Marchand/&gt;

== Authorship ==
The authorship usually is attributed to one Euthalius. He was identified as Bishop of Sulci in [[Sardinia]], but according to [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles|Tregelles]] he was a Bishop of Sulca in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Tregelles, ''An Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament'', London 1856, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[William Wake|Wake]] and L. A. Zacagni Euthalius was a Bishop of Sulce, near [[Aswan|Syene]].&lt;ref name = Bleek&gt;{{cite book|first=F. H. A.|last= Scrivener|authorlink= Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener|title=[[A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament]]|publisher=George Bell &amp; Sons|location=London|year=1894|volume=1|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was suggested{{by whom|date=March 2013}} that the name of the real author of the Apparatus was Evagrius. According to [[John Mill (theologian)|John Mill]] it was [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]].&lt;ref name = Waltz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Bleek, [https://archive.org/stream/introductionton00urwigoog#page/n322/mode/2up ''Introduction to the New Testament''], tranl. [[William Urwick the younger|William Urwick]], Edinburgh 1870, Volume 2, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Hermann von Soden thought, that Euthalius lived in the 7th century, possibly in [[Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;H. von Soden, ''Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments'', pp. 637-649&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce M. Metzger]] stated: "How much of this supplementary material was drawn up by Euthalius and how much was added later is not known."&lt;ref name = Ehrman/&gt;

'''Foma''' is a [[free and open source]] ''finite-state toolkit'' created and maintained by [[Mans Hulden]]. It includes a [[compiler]], [[programming language]], and [[C (programming language)|C]] library for constructing [[finite-state automata]] and [[finite state transducer|transducers]] (FST's) for various uses, most typically [[Natural Language Processing]] uses such as [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological analysis]].

Foma can replace the proprietary [[Xerox Finite State Toolkit]] for compiling and running FST's written in the ''lexc'' and ''xfst'' formalisms. The speed is comparable with the Xerox tools for most lexicons, although foma can be 3 or 4 times slower for very large lexicons (e.g. &gt;100,000 words).{{sfn|Hulden|2009}} Foma is also one of the possible backends of the [[free and open source]] [[HFST|Helsinki Finite State Toolkit]] (where other backends provide support for further formalisms).

There are several [[free and open source|FOSS]] morphologies written in lexc/xfst compatible with foma, e.g. for the [[Sámi languages|Sámi]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Komi language|Komi]], [[Mari language|Mari]], [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]], [[Buryat language|Buriat]], [[Greenlandic language]] and [[Iñupiaq]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://giellatekno.uit.no/english.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822024405/http://giellatekno.uit.no/english.html |archivedate=2011-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gaetano Sanseverino''' (1811 &amp;ndash; 16 November 1865) was an Italian philosopher and theologian.  He made a comparative study including the [[scholastics]], particularly [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], and of the connection between their doctrine and that of the [[church fathers]].

==Biography==

Gaetano Sanseverino was born in 1811 in [[Naples]].

Gaetano made his studies in the seminary in [[Nola]], where his uncle was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]]. After his [[ordination]], he continued the study of philosophy, with the special view of comparing the various systems. Gaetano also became a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of the cathedral of Naples, professor of logic and metaphysics in the [[seminary]], substitute professor of ethics in the university, and eventually [[scrittore]] in the National Library.

Sanseverino had been educated in the [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] system, which at that time prevailed in the ecclesiastical schools of Italy, but his comparative study of the various systems supplied him with a deeper knowledge of the [[scholastics]], particularly [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], and of the intimate connection between their doctrine and that of the church fathers. From that time until the end of his life, his only concern was the restoration of Christian philosophy, in which by his writings, lectures and conversation, he was of supreme assistance to [[Pope Leo XIII]]. With this object, in 1840, he founded ''La Scienza e la Fede'', a periodical which was continued until 1887 by his disciples and associates, Signoriello and d'Amelio.

Gaetano Sanseverino died in Naples of [[cholera]] on 16 November 1865, at age 54.

==Writings==
*His principal work, ''Philosophia christiana cum antiqua et nova comparata'' (5 volumes, Naples, 1862), is incomplete, covering only logic and psychology, but the work is lucid in exposition, extensive in argument, and has a vast number of authors cited and discussed.
*''I principali sistemi della filosofia del criterio, discussi colla dottrina de' Santi Padri e de' Dottori del Medio Evo'' (1850–53), in which he discusses and [[confute]]s the systems of [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Gioberti]] on the criterion of truth.
*''La dottrina di S. Tommaso sull' origine del potere e sul preteso diritto di resistenza'' ("On the origin of authority and the pretended right of resistance", 1853).
* ''Elementa philosophiæ christianæ'' (1864–70), written for the use of his classes, the last volume ("Ethics") being edited by his disciple [[Signoriello]].

'''Great Vow Zen Monastery''' was founded in 2002 and is operated by [[Zen Community of Oregon]][http://www.zendust.org/] (ZCO) under the leadership of abbots [[Jan Chozen Bays|Chozen Bays]], Roshi, and Hogen Bays. The monastery offers weekend workshops, weeklong meditation retreats, and special events throughout the year.

== Teachers==
Great Vow Zen Monastery is a training monastery in the [[White Plum Asanga|White Plum]] lineage of the Japanese [[Soto Zen]] tradition. It is headed by Abbots Hogen Bays and Jan Chozen Bays.

== Physical environment ==
The monastery is housed in a former elementary school on {{convert|20|acre|m2}} of land overlooking the Columbia River floodplain near [[Clatskanie, Oregon]]. Two former classroom "pods" serve as dormitory wings for residents and visitors. Administrative offices and the meditation hall occupy the center of the building. Four unroofed courtyards punctuate the building.

The monastery building is surrounded by a meadow dotted with large conifers. A wooded area with walking trails sits behind the building.

== Zen training ==
The overall style of training at the monastery is primarily in the Soto Zen vein, but incorporates elements from various schools of Buddhism, as well as from other disciplines.

The daily training schedule, which is followed by all residents, includes a wakeup bell at 3:50 a.m., two hours of meditation, a bowing and chanting service, breakfast, and two periods of work. Lunch and dinner are both preceded by a short religious service. Two hours of meditation in the evening end the day. The schedule may be modified at various times of year, or to accommodate special events or classes.

Weekend workshops are offered several times a month. Weeklong meditation intensives are held monthly.

Visiting teachers often lead or co-lead meditation retreats or weekend workshops at the monastery, sometimes on a recurring annual basis. Among them are Buddhist teachers [[Kyogen Carlson]] and [[Gyokuko Carlson]]; Ejo Patrick McMullen; Lama Michael Conklin; [[Alan Wallace]]; and [[Ajahn Amaro]].

Great Vow also offers ordination and full-time residential training as a Soto Zen Buddhist priest.

== Jizo Bodhisattva ==
The [[bodhisattva]] known as [[Jizo]] (in the Japanese tradition; Kṣitigarbha in Sanskrit) has an important role at Great Vow. Practice with Jizo Bodhisattva includes daily chanting of the Jizo mantra; manufacture of Jizo images for sale; a meditation retreat; biannual ceremonies for children and loved ones who have died; and a yearly Jizo-Bon festival event in August.

==Support==
The monastery is sustained by the members of ZCO, which includes a substantial lay congregation that meets for sitting meditation in Portland, and a handful of associated satellite groups in Oregon and Washington.

The monastery is also supported by fundraising efforts; donations from visitors; retreat and workshop fees; and the sale of meditation supplies and Buddhist images.

==Visitors==
Great Vow Zen Monastery has a Sunday morning public program at 10 a.m., which consists of a short service followed by meditation, a talk given by one of the teachers, and lunch.

Visitors may arrange a short-term stay at the monastery.

Both monastery residents and short-term visitors sleep in gender-specific dormitories of several beds to a room. All meals are vegetarian.

'''Hugh Binning''' (1627–1653) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[philosopher]] and [[Theology|theologian]].  Binning was born in Scotland during the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], ordained in the ([[Presbyterian]]) [[Church of Scotland]] and died during the time of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and the [[Commonwealth of England]].

A precocious child, Binning at age 13 was admitted to the study of philosophy at the [[University of Glasgow]]. By the age of 19, he was appointed regent and professor of philosophy at the University of Glasgow. Three years later, he was called to be minister and presided at a church in [[Govan]], adjacent to the city of [[Glasgow]]; a post he held until his untimely death of [[Consumption (disease)|consumption]] at the age of 26. He was a follower of [[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair|James Dalrymple]]. In later life he was well known as an [[evangelical Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Pyle (philosopher)|Andrew Pyle]] (editor), ''Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers'' (2000), article pp. 90-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of the Commonwealth==
Hugh Binning was born two years after [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ascended to the thrones of England, Ireland, and Scotland.  At the time, each was an independent country sharing the same monarch. The [[Acts of Union 1707]] integrated Scotland and England to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]; the [[Acts of Union 1800]] integrated Ireland to form [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].

The period was dominated by both political and religious strife between the three independent countries. The religious dispute centered on whether religion was to be dictated by the monarch or was to be the choice of the people; whether people have a direct relationship with God or they needed to use an intermediary. The civil disputes centered on the extent of the king's power, a question of the [[Divine right of kings]]; specifically whether the King has right to raise taxes and armed forces without the [[Consent of the governed]].  These wars ultimately changed the relationship between king and subjects.

In 1638 the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] voted to remove bishops and the [[Book of Common Prayer]] that had been introduced by Charles I to impose the Anglican model on the Presbyterian Church of Scotland.  Public riots occurred.  The result was the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], an interrelated series of conflicts that took place in the three countries sharing the same monarch. The first of the conflicts was in 1639, the First of the [[Bishops' Wars]], a single border skirmish between England and Scotland; also known as ''the war the armys did not wanted to fight.''

To maintain his English power base Charles I made secret alliances with Catholic Ireland and Presbyterian Scotland to invade Anglican England, promising that each country could establish their own separate state religion. Once these secret entreaties became known to the English [[Long Parliament]], the [[Independent (religion)|Congregationalist faction]] (of which [[Oliver Cromwell]] was a primary spokesman) took matters into their own hands and Parliament established an army separate from the King.  Then, Charles I was executed in January 1649, which led to the rule of [[Cromwell]] and the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]].  The conflicts concluded with [[The English Restoration]] of the monarchy with the return of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], in 1660.

The [[Act of Classes]] was passed by the Parliament of Scotland on 23 January 1649; the act banned [[Royalists]] (people supporting the monarchy) from holding political or military office.  In exile, Charles II signed the [[Treaty of Breda (1650)]] with the Scottish Parliament; among other things, the treaty established Presbyterianism as the national religion.  Charles was crowned King of Scots at [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]] in January 1651.  By September 1651 Scotland was annexed by England, its legislative institutions abolished, Presbyterianism dis-established, and Charles was forced into exile in France.

The Scottish Parliament rescinded the Act of Classes in 1651, which produced a split within Scottish Society.  The sides of the conflict were called the Resolutioners (who supported the rescission of the act – supported the monarchy and the Scottish [[House of Stewart]]) and the Protesters (who supported Cromwell and the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]); Binning sided with the Protestors.&lt;ref&gt;

When Cromwell sent troops to Scotland, he was also attempting to dis-establish [[Presbyterian]]ism and the [[Church of Scotland]], Binning spoke against Cromwell's act.  On Saturday 19 April 1651, Cromwell entered Glasgow and the next day he heard a sermon by three ministers who condemned Cromwell for invading Scotland.  That evening, Cromwell summoned those ministers and others, to a debate on the issue.  At the debate, Rev Hugh Binning is said to have out-debated Cromwell's ministers so completely that he silenced Cromwell's ministers.&lt;ref&gt;

==Politics==
Hugh Binning political views were based on his theology.  Binning was a [[Covenanter]], a movement that began in Scotland at [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] in 1638 with the National Covenant and continued with the 1643 [[Solemn League and Covenant]] – in effect a treaty between the English [[Long Parliament]] and Scotland for the preservation of the reformed religion in exchange for troops to confront the threat of Irish Catholic troops joining the [[Royalist]] army.  Binning could also be described as a Protestor; both political positions were taken because of their religious implications.  However, he saw the evils of the politics of his day was not a “fomenter of factions” writing “A Treatise of Christian Love” as a response.&lt;ref name="worthies"&gt;{{cite book

==Theology==
Because of the turmoil time in which Hugh Binning lived, politics and religion were inexorably intertwined.  Binning was a [[Calvinist]] and follower of [[John Knox]].  As a profession, Binning was trained as a Philosopher, and he believed that [[philosophy]] was the servant of [[theology]].  He thought that both Philosophy and Theology should be taught in parallel. Binning's writing, which are primarily a collection of his sermons, “forms an important bridge between the 17th century, when philosophy in Scotland was heavily dominated by Calvinism, and the 18th century when figures such as [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] re-asserted a greater degree of independence between the two and allied philosophy with the developing human sciences.”

&lt;/ref&gt;

Religiously, Hugh Binning was, what we would call today, an [[Evangelical]] [[Calvinist]].  He spoke on the primacy of God's love as the ground of salvation: 
:… our salvation is not the business of Christ alone, but the whole Godhead is interested in it deeply, so deeply that you cannot say who loves it most, or who likes it most.  The Father is the very fountain of it, his love is the spring of all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

With regards to the extent of the ‘atonement’, Hugh Binning, did not hold that the offer of redemption applied only to the few that are [[Unconditional election|elect]] but said that “the ultimate ground of faith is in the electing will of God.” In Scotland during the 1600s the questions concerning atonement revolved around the terms in which the offer was expressed.&lt;ref name="Scottish Theology"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Binning believed that "forgiveness is based on Christ's death, understood as a satisfaction and as a sacrifice: 'If he had pardoned sin without any satisfaction what rich grace it had
been! But truly, to provide the Lamb and sacrifice himself, to find out
the ransom, and to exact it of his own Son, in our name, is a testimony
of mercy and grace far beyond that. But then, his justice is very conspicuous
in this work.'"&lt;ref name="Scottish Theology2"&gt;Macleod, Donald&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|65}}

==Works==
All of the works of Hugh Binning were published posthumously and were primarily collections of his sermons.  Of his speaking style, it was said: "There is originality without any affectation, a rich imagination, without anything fanciful or extravert, the utmost simplicity, without an thing mean or trifling."  &lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The documents seems to have been presented to the Society either by Hugh Binning's son, John, or his widow, Barbara Gordon (who remarried about 1657 to James Gordon; he was born in Ireland and became a minister at Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland.)

::''On Charity''
:::Charity “thinketh no evil.” [1 Cor. 13:5] Charity is apt to take all things in the best sense. If a thing may be subject to diverse acceptations, it can put the best construction on it. It is so benign and good in its own nature that it is not inclinable to suspect others. It desires to condemn no man, but would gladly, as far as reason and conscience will permit, absolve every man. It is so far from desire of revenge, that it is not provoked or troubled with an injury. For that were nothing else but to wrong itself because others have wronged it already, and it is so far from wronging others, that it will not willingly so much as think evil of them. Yet if need require, charity can execute justice, and inflict chastisement, not out of desire of another’s misery, but out of love and compassion to mankind. Charitas non punit quia peccatum est, sed ne peccaretur, ''it looks more to prevention of future sin, than to revenge of a bypast fault'', and can do all without any discomposure of spirit, as a physician cuts a vein without anger. Quis enim cut medetur irascitur? “''Who is angry at his own patient''?”&lt;ref name="kindle-works6"&gt;Kindle Locations 16505-16513&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1735 a collections of Binning's works were published posthumously, originally edited by Rev. M. Leishman, D.D., a minister who was a later successor to Hugh in the parish of Govan, which contained sermons not previously published.  There has been several editions of the '''Complete''' "Works of the Rev. Hugh Binning", one of the latest (Classic Reprint) was published by Forgotten Books in 2012 &lt;ref name="Works of Hugh Binning"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Hugh Binning was the son of John Binning and Margaret M'Kell. Margaret was the daughter of Rev. Matthew M'Kell,&lt;ref name="kindle-works7"&gt;Binning, Hugh; Kindle Locations 20469-20474&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"Matthew M’Kell, was a minister in the parish of [[Bothwell]], near Glasgow.  “After having been, on different occasions brought before the Privy council, and imprisoned, he was, on the 8th of January, 1674, upon his refusing to engage not to preach, ordered to confine himself to the parish of [[Carluke]], and security was required from him that he would appear before the Council at their summons…. He died at Edinburgh, in March 1681”. (Works of Hugh Binning: Kindle Locations 20469-20474)&lt;/ref&gt; 
who was a minister in the parish of Bothwell, Scotland, and sister of Hugh M'Kell, a minister in Edinburgh.
&lt;ref name="kindle-works8"&gt;Binning, Hugh; Kindle Locations 20476-20478&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Some authors suggest that Matthew M'Kell was either the grandfather or uncle to Hugh M'Kail (sometimes Hugh M'Kell), which would make Hugh M'Kail a brother-in-law to Hugh Binning.  Spelling of names was not as precise in those days, e.g. when describing Hugh Binning in the same document, there are variations of the spelling of the Binning name.  
Hugh M’Kell was arrested for being concerned in the insurrection at [[Pentland Rising]]. Hugh M'Keil was imprisoned and tortured (his foot was mangled to the point of compound fractures using the [[Boot (torture)|boot]]). In the end, M'Kell was executed in Edinburgh on 22 December 1666 because he would not sign the [[Test Act]] – because his preaching would not conform to the Anglican tradition. "The address of young M’Kail on the scaffold concluded with these sublime expressions—“Farewell, father and mother, friends and relations. Farewell the world, and all delights. Farewell meat and drink. Farewell sun, moon and stars. Welcome God and Father! Welcome sweet Lord Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant! Welcome blessed Spirit of grace, and God of all consolation! Welcome glory! Welcome eternal life! Welcome death!” 
We are told by Kirkton that “when Mr. M’Kail died, there was such a lamentation as was never known in Scotland before, not one dry cheek upon all the street or in all the numberless windows in the market place” 
It was discovered afterwards, that [[Alexander Burnet]], then the archbishop of Glasgow, had in his possession at the time, a letter from the king, forbidding any more blood to be shed. But to the disgrace of his sacred profession, and of his feelings as a man, “Burnet let the execution go on, before he produced his letter, pretending there was no council day between” (Binning, Hugh (24 March 2011).

Hugh Binning was born on the estate of his father in Dalvennan, [[Straiton]], in the [[Ayrshire|shire of Ayr]].  The family owned other land in the parishes of [[Straiton]] and [[Colmonell]] as well as [[Maybole]] in [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]].

In 1645, [[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair]], who was Hugh's master (primary professor) in the study of philosophy, announced he was retiring from the University of Glasgow.  After a national search for a replacement on the faculty, three men were selected to compete for the position.  Hugh was one of those selected, but was at a disadvantage because of his extreme youth and because he was not of noble birth. However, he had strong support from the existing faculty, who suggested that the candidates speak extemporaneously on any topic of the candidate's choice.  After hearing Hugh speak, the other candidates withdrew, making Hugh a regent and professor of philosophy, while he was still 18 years old.&lt;ref name="worthies2"&gt;Scottish Worthies p 203&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|203}}

On 7 February 1648 (at the age of 21) Hugh was appointed an Advocate before the Court of Sessions (an attorney).  In the same year he married Barbara Simpson (sometimes called Mary), daughter of Rev. James Simpson a minister in Ireland.  Their son, John, was born in 1650.&lt;ref name="Works of Hugh Binning"/&gt;

Hugh died around September 1653 and was buried in the churchyard of Govan, where [[Patrick Gillespie]], then principal of the University of Glasgow, ordered a monument inscribed in Latin, roughly translated: 
:Here lies Mr. Hugh Binning, a man distinguished for his piety and eloquence, learned in philology, philosophy, and theology, a Prelate, faithful to the Gospel, and finally an excellent preacher.  In the middle of a series of events, he was taken at the age of 26, in the year of our Lord 1653. Alive, he changed the society of his own land because he walked with God.  And if you wish to make other inquires, the rest should keep silence, since neither you nor the marble can comprehend it.&lt;ref&gt;Binning, Hugh (24 March 2011). The Works of the Rev. Hugh Binning (Kindle Locations 990-992). Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh's widow, Barbara (sometimes called Mary), then remarried James Gordon, an Anglican priest at Cumber in Ireland.  Together they had a daughter, Jean who married Daniel MacKenzie, who was on the winning side of the [[Battle of Bothwell Bridge]] serving as an ensign under Lieutenant-Colonel William Ramsay (who became the third [[Earl of Dalhousie]]), in the Earl of Mar's Regiment of Foot.&lt;ref name="jardine"/&gt;

Hugh's son, John Binning, married Hanna Keir, who was born in Ireland.  The Binning's were [[Covenanters]], a resistance movement that objected to the return of Charles II (who was received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed).  They were on the losing side in the 1679 [[Battle of Bothwell Bridge]]. Most of the rebels who were not executed were exiled to the Americas; about 30 Covenanters were exiled to the Carolinas on the Carolina Merchant in 1684. After the battle, John and Hanna were separated.

In the aftermath of the battle at Bothwell Bridge, Hugh's widow (now Barbara Gordon) tried to reclaim the family estate at Dalvennan by saying that John and his wife owed his step father a considerable some of money.  The legal action was successful and Dalvennan became the possession of John's half sister Jean, and her husband Daniel MacKenzie.&lt;ref name="jardine"/&gt; In addition, Jean came into possession Hanna Keir's property in Ireland.

By 1683, Jean was widowed.  John Binning was branded a traitor, was sentenced to death and forfeited his property to the Crown.  John's wife (Hanna Keir) was branded as a traitor and forfeited her property in Ireland.  In 1685 Jean "donated" the Binning family's home at Dalvennan and other properties, along with the Keir properties to Roderick MacKenzie, who was a Scottish advocate of [[James II of England|James II (James VII of Scotland)]], and the [[baillie]] of [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]]. According to an act of the Scottish Parliament, Roderick MacKenzie was also very effective in “suppressing the rebellious, fanatical party in the western and other shires of this realm, and putting the laws to vigorous execution against them”&lt;ref&gt;

Since Bothwell Bridge, Hanna had been hiding from the authorities.  In 1685 Hanna was in Edinburgh where she was found during a sweep for subversives and imprisoned in the [[Tolbooth]] of Edinburgh, a combination city hall and prison. Those arrested with Hanna were exiled to North America, however she developed [[Dysentery]] and remained behind.  By 1687, near death, Hanna petitioned the [[Privy Council of Scotland]] for her release; she was exiled to her family in Ireland, where she died around 1692.&lt;ref name="jardine"/&gt;
 
In 1690 the Scottish Parliament rescinded John's fines and forfeiture, but he was not able to recover his family's estates, the courts suggesting that John had relinquished his claim to Dalvennan in exchange for forgiveness of debt, rather than forfeiture.&lt;ref&gt;

There is little documentation about John after his wife's death. John received a small income from royalties on his father Hugh's works after parliament extended copyrights on Hugh's writings to him.  However, the income was not significant and John made several petitions to the Scottish parliament for money, the last occurring in 1717.  It is thought that John died in [[Somerset]] county, in southwestern England.

'''Japanese values''' are cultural assumptions and ideals particular to [[Japanese culture]]. The [[Honne and tatemae|honne/tatemae divide]] between public expression and private thoughts/feelings is considered to be of paramount importance in [[Japanese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Takeo Doi, ''The Anatomy of Dependence: Exploring an area of the Japanese psyche – feelings of indulgence''. Kodansha International Ltd.: 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Japanese mythology]], the gods display human emotions, such as [[love]] and [[anger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=B.H. |last=Chamberlain |authorlink=Basil Hall Chamberlain |year=1883 |title=A Translation of the "Ko-Ji-Ki"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these stories, behaviour that results in positive relations with others is rewarded, and empathy, identifying oneself with another, is highly valued. By contrast, those actions that are individualistic or antisocial (those that harm others) are condemned. Hurtful behaviour is punished in the myths by ostracizing the offender.

No society can exist that does not manage and integrate [[antisocial behavior]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Japanese children learn from their earliest days that human fulfillment comes from close association with others. Children learn early to recognize that they are part of an interdependent society, beginning in the family and later extending to larger groups such as neighborhood, school, playground, community, and company. Dependence on others is a natural part of the human condition; it is viewed negatively only when the social obligations ([[Giri (Japanese)|giri]]) it creates are too onerous to fulfill, leading to, for example, [[Suicide in Japan|suicide]], which is a topic of great elaboration in [[History of Japan|Japanese history]] and [[Japanese culture|culture]]. However, in the early part of the 21st century, school [[bullying]] has become a topic of very great concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=School bullying in Japan |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/newsenglish/witn/2006/11/061115_bullying.shtml |accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In interpersonal relationships, most Japanese tend to avoid open [[competition]] and [[wikt:confrontation|confrontation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]], The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, 1946, page154&lt;/ref&gt; Working with others requires self-control, but it carries the rewards of pride in contributing to the group, emotional security, and social identity. [[Wa (Japanese culture)|Wa]] ({{lang|ja|和}}), the notion of harmony within a group, requires an attitude of cooperation and a recognition of social roles. If each individual in the group understands personal obligations and empathizes with the situations of others, then the group as a whole benefits. Success can come only if all put forth their best individual efforts. Decisions are often made only after consulting with everyone in the group. [[Consensus]] does not imply that there has been universal agreement, but this style of consultative decision-making involves each member of the group in an information exchange, reinforces feelings of group identity, and makes implementation of the decision smoother. Cooperation within a group also is often focused on competition between that group and a parallel one, whether the issue is one of educational success or market share. Symbols such as [[uniform]]s, names, banners, and songs identify the group as distinct from others both to outsiders and to those within the group. Participation in group activities, whether official or unofficial, is a symbolic statement that an individual wishes to be considered part of the group. Thus, [[nomikai|after-work bar hopping]] provides not only instrumental opportunities for the exchange of information and release of social tensions but also opportunities to express nonverbally a desire for continued affiliation.

Working in a group in Japan requires the development of successful channels of [[communication]], which reinforce group interdependence, and the sense of difference from those who are not members of the group. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Yet social interaction beyond that which occurs with individuals with whom one lives and works is a necessity in contemporary society. If the exchange is brief and relatively insignificant, such as buying a newspaper, anonymity will be maintained. But if the relationship is expected to continue over a long period, whether in business, marriage, employment, or neighborhood, great care is likely to be invested in establishing and maintaining good relationships. Such relationships are often begun by using the social networks of a relative, friend, or colleague who can provide an introduction to the desired person or serve as {{nihongo|go-between|仲人|nakoudo}}. The nakoudo most often refers to the person (or people) who negotiates [[omiai|marriage arrangements]], including checking each family's background, conveying questions and criticisms, and smoothing out difficulties. But this kind of personal mediation is common in many aspects of Japanese life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]], The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, 1946, page155&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism}}
In Indian philosophy and [[Indian religions|religion]], '''jñāna''' (Sanskrit, pronounced gya:nə) ([[Pali]]: ''ñāṇa'') or '''gyan/gian''' ([[Hindi]]: ''jñān'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/gyan |title=Gyan – definition of ''gyan'' in English |website=[[Oxford Dictionaries]] |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is "knowledge".

The idea of jnana centers on a cognitive event which is recognized when experienced. It is knowledge inseparable from the total experience of reality, especially a total or divine reality ([[Brahman]]).&lt;ref name="brittanica on jnana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/304133/jnana |title=jnana (Indian religion) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The root [[:wikt:ज्ञान|jñā-]] is cognate to  English ''[[:wikt:know|know]]'', as well as to the Greek [[:wikt:γιγνώσκω|γνώ-]] (as in γνῶσις ''[[gnosis]]'') and Russian ''[[:wikt:знание|знание]]''. Its antonym is ''ajñāna'' "ignorance".

==In Buddhism==
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], it refers to pure awareness that is free of conceptual encumbrances, and is contrasted with [[vijnana]], which is a moment of 'divided knowing'. Entrance to, and progression through the ten stages of Jnana/Bhimis, will lead one to complete enlightenment and [[nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;Gampopa's "Jewel Ornament of Liberation", especially the ten bhumis, where the absorption state or non-dual state, which characterizes all ten bhumis, in this well-respected traditional text, is equated to the state of jnana&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Vipassanā]] tradition of [[Buddhism]]  there are the following ñanas according to [[Mahasi Sayadaw]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Progress of Insight: (Visuddhiñana-katha), by The Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw, translated from the Pali with Notes by Nyanaponika Thera (1994; 33pp./99KB)&lt;/ref&gt;  As a person meditates these ñanas or "knowledges" will be experienced in order.  The experience of each may be brief or may last for years and the subjective intensity of each is variable. Each ñana could also be considered a [[jhāna]] although many are not stable and the mind has no way to remain embedded in the experience.  Experiencing all the ñanas will lead to the first of the [[Four stages of enlightenment]] then the cycle will start over at a subtler level.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
# Analytical Knowledge of Body and Mind (nama-rupa-pariccheda-ñana) (corresponds to 1st jhana)
# Knowledge by Discerning Conditionality (paccaya-pariggaha-ñana)
# Knowledge by Comprehension (sammasana-ñana)
# Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away (udayabbaya-ñana)           (corresponds to 2nd jhana)
# Knowledge of Dissolution (bhanga-ñana)                            (corresponds to 3rd jhana)
# Awareness of Fearfulness (bhayatupatthana-ñana)

==In Hinduism==

Sahu explains:
{{quote|''Prajnanam iti Brahman'' - wisdom is the soul/spirit. ''Prajnanam'' refers to the intuitive truth which can be verified/tested by reason. It is a higher function of the intellect that ascertains the ''Sat'' or Truth in the ''Sat-Chit-Ananda'' or truth-consciousness-bliss, i.e. the ''Brahman/Atman/Self''/person [...] A truly wise person [...] is known as ''[[Prajna (Vedic)|Prajna]]'' - who has attained ''Brahman''hood itself; thus, testifying to the ''Vedic'' ''Maha Vakya'' (great saying or words of wisdom): ''Prajnanam iti Brahman''.{{sfn|Sahu|2004|p=41}}}}

[[Jnana yoga]] (Yoga of Knowledge) is one of the three main paths ([[Sadhana|margas]]), which are supposed to lead towards [[moksha]] (liberation) from material miseries. The other two main paths  are [[Karma yoga]] and [[Bhakti Yoga]]. [[Rāja yoga]] (classical yoga) which includes several yogas, is also said to lead to moksha. It is said that each path is meant for a different temperament of personality.

== In Jainism ==
{{Main|Jain epistemology}}
According to the Jain texts like [[Tattvārthsūtra]] and [[Sarvārthasiddhi]], knowledge is of five kinds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details|title=Reality_JMT|last=Jain|first=S.A.|year=1992|publisher=Jwalamalini Trustp=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Andrew Leslie''' (born 2 August 1940) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[philosophy|philosopher]]. He was educated at [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], earning his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[English Literature]] in 1962 and his [[Master of Letters|M.Litt.]] in [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] in 1968. He is currently [[Professor]] [[emeritus]] at the [[University of Guelph]], in [[Ontario]], Canada.

In his book ''Universes'', Leslie describes a philosophical [[parable]] in which an individual survives a [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] of fifty expert [[marksman|marksmen]] unscathed. He offers two explanations for this remarkable event: either it is a fortuitous outcome, to be expected occasionally by pure chance among many thousands of attempted executions by firing squad; or it is intentional. [[Francis Collins]] references this parable in his book ''The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief'' as part of his argument that the [[Anthropic Principle]] strongly suggests a [[Creator deity|Creator]] with intent.

Leslie has spoken as follows about his life's work: &lt;blockquote&gt;What I have to contribute is some technical defense of the idea that if you had an infinitely rich [universe], it could be explained by reference to its value.  Its goodness could be the creative force which had produced it.  I think if I would like to be remembered as a philosopher for any one thing, that would be the thing I'd most like to be remembered for.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''John of Wales''', OFM ([[Wales]], 13th century – [[Paris]] 1285), a.k.a. ''John Waleys'' and ''Johannes Guallensis'', was a [[Franciscan]] theologian who wrote several well-received [[Latin]] works, primarily preaching aids, in Oxford and Paris in the [[Middle Ages|late-thirteenth century]].

==Life==

Born between 1210–1230, almost certainly in Wales, he joined the Franciscan order, and incepted in [[theology]] at [[Oxford University]] sometime before 1258. After this, he taught there until 1270 when he moved to Paris, where he remained until his death around 1285. He was a moral theologian and a great admirer of the ancient world, incorporating many classical authors into his works.

==Works==

He wrote several works in Latin, with a great success. The most important ones are the following: 
* ''Breviloquium de philosophia, sive sapientia sanctorum'' (Short treatise about philosophy, or wisdom of the saints), translated into [[Catalan language|Catalan]] in the 15th century.
* ''Compendiloquium'', which is a summary of the history of [[philosophy]].
* ''Communiloquium'' or ''Summa collationum'', which is a kind of manual for priests and preachers, and which was also translated into [[Catalan language|Catalan]] in the 14th century.

'''Karl Theodor Bayrhoffer''' (14 October 1812, in [[Marburg]] &amp;ndash; 3 February 1888) was a [[German American]] philosopher and [[publicist]].

In 1834 he received his PhD from the [[University of Marburg]], where he later was named an associate professor of philosophy (1838, a full professor in 1845).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lagis-hessen.de/de/subjects/idrec/sn/bio/id/3988 Bayrhoffer, Karl Theodor] Hessische Biografie&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of the [[Diet of Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel) in 1848, and in 1850 was President of the Chamber.  After the defeat of his party (Democratic) he came to the United States in 1852&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Karl Theodor Bayrhoffer|url = https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karl_Theodor_Bayrhoffer&amp;oldid=137276439|language = de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and settled in [[Wisconsin]] as a farmer, though from 1866 he lived principally by his pen.

In his early writings, notably in ''Die Idee und Geschichte der Philosophie'' ("Idea and History of Philosophy", 1838), he appears as a zealous disciple of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].  Afterward he became a champion of [[German Catholics (sect)|German Catholicism]] and wrote ''Researches into the Essence, History, and Criticism of Religion'' (1849).

== Biography and career ==

Paul graduated from [[Antioch College]] in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]] in 1990 with a B.A. in [[chemistry]]. Before going to graduate school, Paul corresponded with a number of philosophers about their work, including [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] and [[Lynne Rudder Baker]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/05/opportunity-cost.html "Opportunity Cost: Marginal Revolution"]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, Paul graduated from [[Princeton University]] with a Ph.D in [[philosophy]], where she wrote a [[Thesis|dissertation]] titled ''Essays on Causation'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Essays_on_Causation.html?id=NrfltgAACAAJ '"Essays on Causation"]&lt;/ref&gt; under the supervision of [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/05/new-apps-interview-la-paul.html "New APPS Interview: LA Paul"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul taught at [[Yale University]] from 1999 to 2001, and at the [[University of Arizona]] from 2001 until 2008, before moving to North Carolina.  She has also held appointments at the [[Australian National University]] and at the [[University of St. Andrews]].

She is married to sociologist [[Kieran Healy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2008/08/23/189128/mereological_update/ "Think Progress: Matthew Yglesias"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical work ==

Paul's principal research interests are in [[metaphysics]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. Her work focuses on causation, [[mereology]], the philosophy of [[time]], and related topics in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the [[philosophy of science]], and [[philosophy of language]]. Her work in [[ontology]] and mereology develops a distinctive view of objects as fusions of property instances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Metaphysics.html?id=0vGzcQAACAAJ "Metaphysics: 5 Questions (Interview with LA Paul)"]&lt;/ref&gt; Her article "What You Can't Expect When You're Expecting" develops the notion of transformative experience and explores its consequences for the possibility of rational decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2013/03/11/173977133/is-having-a-child-a-rational-decision "Tania Lombrozo, Is Having a Child a Rational Decision?

'''Lars Gule''' (born 24 June 1955) is a Norwegian [[philosopher]], [[Social commentary|social commentator]] and [[associate professor]] (at [[Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences]], HiOA). From 2000 to 2005 he was secretary general of the [[Norwegian Humanist Association]]. Gule became known to the general public in 1977 when he after having joined the far-left Palestinian [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine|DFLP]] group was arrested in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] with explosives in his luggage, and imprisoned in the country for six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Han ble tatt med sprengstoff på vei til militant aksjon i Israel.

==Education and professional life==
Lars Gule studied history, [[philosophy]] and [[social science]] at the [[University of Bergen]] and received his [[doctoral degree]] in philosophy (doctor artium) at the same university in 2003 when he defended the dissertation ''Social Development and Political Progress in Two Traditions'' A Conceptual and Comparative Analysis of Western and Arab-Islamic Ideas of Social and Political Change and Improvement.&lt;ref&gt;For more on the content of the thesis, see [http://www.uib.no/info/dr_grad/2003/gule.htm Utvikling som fruktbar og nødvendig metafor]. uib.no(2003) (in Norwegian).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 he administered the Middle Eastern Languages and Culture subject as well as The Centre for the Study of the Sciences and the Humanities, both at the University of Bergen. In 1989, he was associated with the [[Chr. Michelsen Institute]] (CMI) human rights programme as a PhD student and [[Academic administration|administrator]]. He later returned to the University of Bergen ([[Centre for Development Studies]]) as coordinator of the research programme ''Nature, Society and Water'' (1998–2000).

From July 2000 to December 2005 he was secretary general of the [[Norwegian Humanist Association]] (see below). From February 2006 he was Programme Director at the Center for Multicultural and International Work Sefia (discontinued) at [[Oslo University College]], and in August 2007 he moved to a position as associate professor (following the closure of Sefia) related to the fields of multicultural understanding and development studies at the [[Department of Education and International Studies]], [[Oslo and Akershus University College]]. From January 2009, the Gule was also associated with HiO's (from 1 August 2011 HiOA's) [[Centre for the Study of Professions]] (SPS) in a 50% position as a [[post doctor]]. From January 2010 he became a full-time post doctor research fellow at the SPS and worked, ''inter alia'', with professional practice in multicultural society. The post doctor fellowship ended in August 2013. From November the same year he obtained a full-time position as associate professor at the same university college, continuing to work on multicultural issues. However, Gule's research interests have moved in the direction of extremism after the terrorist attacks in Oslo and at Utøya on 22 July 2011, and from the fall semester of 2015 he is contributing to the teaching of a 15 ECT credit course called "Knowledge on Extremism and Radicalisation" (in Norwegian).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hioa.no/Studier-og-kurs/LU/Evu/Kunnskap-om-ekstremisme-og-radikalisering&lt;/ref&gt;

== Travel to Lebanon and prison ==
In January 1977 Gule travelled from Norway on a trip that was supposed to take him through much of the Middle East. The first goal was Lebanon, where most people believed the situation was beginning to normalize after one and half years of civil war. Gule sympathized with the Palestinian cause and became involved in the [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (DFLP), a Palestinian political party and guerilla group that has also used terror in its struggle against Israel. Gule has, however, since denied that it was his intention to participate in terrorism and describes his involvement as part of the “anti-imperialist” struggle.&lt;ref Name="Emberland92"&gt;“Norway's first international terrorist”, interview with Terje Emberland in ''Humanist'' No. 1 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the DFLP asked Gule to carry out an armed operation in Israel in early June 1977. Gule has explained that the DFLP proposed three targets for him: a bomb could be placed either be in a pedestrian underpass in [[Tel Aviv]], in the [[President Hotel, Jerusalem|President Hotel]] in [[Jerusalem]] or outside an apartment complex with gas containers outside in what was called a “bourgeois neighbourhood”." He rejected these targets as he was sceptical of what could be regarded as terrorism. “The suspect had made it known to his employers that he did not want to take human life. The purpose of the explosion was to mark the 10th anniversary of the war in 1967, strengthen the Palestinians' fighting spirit and morale”, he said later during interrogation to the Norwegian police.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. report written by police officer Nils Drolsum, 8.11. 1977, cited by Odd Karsten Tveit in ''Alt for Israel'', Cappelen forlag, 1996, {{ISBN|82-02-15732-3}}, page 620 (in Norwegian). See also the afterword in Gule's book ''Ekstremismens kjennetegn'', Abstrakt 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not succeed in engaging the DFLP in a discussion on a more symbolic target.&lt;ref name="Emberland92"/&gt;

As it was not possible to travel directly from Lebanon to Israel, Gule was to travel back to Norway where he was to procure a new passport (without Arab visas) before he went on to Israel after a few weeks, during the time he would consider if he could participate in such an operation. He received a plane ticket to Europe and $1,300 (US) from the DFLP, to cover the other travel expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Odd Karsten Tveit in ''Alt for Israel'', Cappelen forlag, 1996, {{ISBN|82-02-15732-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the security check in Beirut International Airport on 6 May when Gule was about to leave Lebanon, a security officers found approximately 750&amp;nbsp;grams of plastic explosives hidden in the covers of books Gule had in his backpack. He was eventually handed over to the Lebanese intelligence service and after harsh interrogations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fritanke.no/upload/2006/nr01/fri_tanke_0106.pdf Free Thought]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} – Interview with Lars Gule in paragraphs 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Gule confessed to his cooperation with the DFLP. Gule has explained how he was exposed to [[torture]], including being beaten under the soles of the feet and threatened with liquidation.&lt;ref name="Emberland92"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with ''Gateavisa'' (an anarchist journal) No. 2, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odd Karsten Tveit, ''Alt for Israel'', Cappelen forlag, 1996, {{ISBN|82-02-15732-3}}, pp. 613–615. Tveit's account is based on newspaper reports, police reports, interviews with Gule and Gule's own notes from jail.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gule was sentenced to six months prison in [[Lebanon]] and a fine for the “illegal possession of weapons” (i.e. explosives). He was acquitted of attempting to carry out terrorist acts using explosives.&lt;ref&gt;Odd Karsten Tveit, ''Alt for Israel'', p. 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case attracted great attention in Norwegian media in the summer of 1977, and when Gule was released from prison and returned to Norway in November 1977, he was questioned by the Norwegian police. The attorney general, however, chose to react with a waiver, even though he repeated his statement about having begun what could be construed as planning a bombing in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;The most comprehensive presentation of Gule's actions in Lebanon are in Tveit book, ''Alt for Israel'', pp. 610–622, but see also the  interview, “Norway's first international terrorist” in ''Humanist'' no. 1, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secretary general of the Norwegian Humanist Association ==
Back in Norway Gule began studying history at the [[University of Bergen]] in 1978. Then, after completing an MA in philosophy, he administered the programme Middle Eastern Languages and Culture as well as The Centre for the Study of the Sciences and the Humanities, both at the [[University of Bergen]]. In 1989, he became associated with the [[Chr. Michelsen Institute]] Human Rights Programme as a PhD student. He later returned to the University of Bergen (Centre for Development Studies) as coordinator of the research programme ''Nature, Society and Water'' (1998–2000).

In 2000 Gule was appointed to secretary general of the [[Norwegian Humanist Association]] and started working there on 1 July. He served in this capacity until 9 December 2005. The immediate resignation came as a result of a disagreement with the Executive Board on an organizational questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.human.no/templates/Page____3011. aspx “En generalsekretærs avgang”]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Fri Tanke'', No. 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fritanke.no/LESERBREV/2006/Roar_Johansen_En_generalsekretars_avgang__svar_til_Lars_Gule/ Roar Johansen: En generalsekretærs avgang – svar til Lars Gule]. Fritanke.no (14 June 2006). Retrieved on 2012-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt; But his departure from the position only meant that his resignation from the fixed term of six years was advanced a few months.

Gule was till then the secretary general who had been in the position for the second longest time in the history of the Norwegian Humanist Association, {{frac|5|1|2}} years. Gule emphasized the equality of all life stances – religious and secular – and promoted human rights during his period. He contributed frequently to the media and participated in public debate. He was often controversial, not least with his criticism of fundamentalist Islam. Yet he defended the religious freedom of Muslims and the right to be a Muslim in Norway. Controversial was his statements about faith communities' right to discriminate, including women and gays, because those who feel discriminated against have an [[exit option]]. This option dissolves the apparent contradiction between fundamental rights – religious freedom and the right not to be discriminated against. This is why the state should not intervene in the internal affairs of religious communities, in Gule's opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Expressed for example in an article in the journal [[Samtiden]], No. 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the work of a professional historian on the history of the Norwegian Humanist Association, Gule is considered a distinctive  ideological leader of the organization. He also emphasized Gule's commitment to human rights during his period as secretary general.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Knutsen]], ''Livet før døden. Human-Etisk Forbund 1956–2006'', Humanist forlag, 2006, {{ISBN|82-92622-15-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social commentator==
As early as at high school in his home town [[Larvik]] in the early 1970s, Gule participated the public debate. For a period he was active in Sosialistisk Valgforbunds Ungdom (which later became the [[Socialist Youth (Norway)|Socialist Youth]]) and Sosialistisk Valgforbund, later the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] (SV), but he was never a member of the Marxist–Leninist-Maoist SUF (m–l) (later [[Red Youth (Norway)|Rød Ungdom]]) or [[Workers' Communist Party (Norway)|Workers' Communist Party]] (Arbeidernes kommunistparti (AKP (m–l)).

Because of what Gule calls a radical anti-imperialist commitment, he became involved in the Palestinian struggle for liberation in 1977 and agreed to participate in an armed attack against Israel. This choice came after a long process that involved a break with a previous non-violent revolutionary position Gule had advocated, among other things, as a member of Folkereisning mot krig, the Norwegian branch of [[War Resisters International]] earlier in the 1970s. This happened because of a growing conviction that the imperialist and reactionary forces in the world could not be overthrown without the use of violence. The US-backed coup against [[Salvador Allende]]'s government in the [[Chile]] in 1973, was highly important in this development.&lt;ref Name="Emberland92"/&gt;

When Gule began at the [[University of Bergen]], he came in contact with a small but radical group that worked on the development of [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of [[communism]] as a [[mode of production]]. Through this work Gule came to distance himself from Marxism as [[ideology]] and from “the left's romance with violence” (including a writing a self-criticism in [[Dagbladet]] in 1979). In the article “Some critical considerations of the Marxist class struggle theory”,&lt;ref&gt;''Ariadne'' No 1, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; he delivered a theoretical critique of the Marxist theory of [[class struggle]] as a necessity for the Communist [[revolution]].

He became a member of the [[social democratic]] [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|Workers' Youth League]], the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]]'s student group, and was briefly leader of the organization at the University of Bergen (1984), but has not since been active in the Workers' Youth League (or Labour Party). He is currently a politically independent, though his social views and positions in the public debate places him on the “left”.

The interest in the [[Middle East]] that was ignited during his stay in [[Lebanon]] in 1977 has followed Gule through his studies. His [[Master's degree]] in [[philosophy]] (1986) was entitled “Adlyd Gud og de med autoritet blant dere” (Obey God, and those with authority among you) and was a study of classical Islamic and modern Arab political thought. This led to an interest in [[Islam]] and [[human rights]] that Gule has pursued since. This is reflected in several articles and is also a central theme in his doctoral dissertation.

Gule often participates in the public debate through newspaper articles and online debates, where he is particularly critical of totalitarian ideologies and religions. Therefore, he supported Professor [[Bernt Hagtvet]]'s criticism of [[Workers' Communist Party (Norway)|Workers' Communist Party]] (Arbeidernes kommunistparti (AKP (m–l))&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2003/08/11/375669.html Ærlig talt, AKP! – Kultur]. Dagbladet.no (11 August 2003). Retrieved on 2012-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also frequently used as a commentator and debater on radio and television on matters related to the Middle East, Islam, religion and cultural conflicts. In the public debate as well as in his academic work, Gule tries to present a consistent defence of human rights.

Throughout his term as secretary general of the NHA, Gule also focused on the critique of religion. Although he also criticized Christianity, he has been a particularly critical of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Gule,''Islam og det moderne'' (Islam and modernity), Abstrakt forlag, 2006, {{ISBN|978-82-7935-186-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honestthinking.org/no/pub08/Kk.2008.10.11.LG.Islams_elendighet.htm “Islams elendighet”] (The Misery of Islam), Klassekampen (2008.11.11).&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gule rejects and is sharply criticizes what he perceives as a simplified, erroneous and / or exaggerated representations of a threat from Islam – [[Islamophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example his criticism of [[Carl I. Hagen]], [http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2004/07/16/403168.html “Hagens islamhets”], Dagbladet (2004-07-16), and [[Hallgrim Berg]]'s book ''Amerikabrevet'', [http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2007/03/11/494606.html “En advarsel”], Dagbladet (11 March 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Gule is still a strong critic of Israel, which he characterizes as a racist state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klassekampen.no/kk/index.php/news/home/artical_categories/kommentarer/2006/august/israel_rasisme_og_vaart_ansvar- “Israel, rasisme og vårt ansvar”]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Klassekampen (19 August 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; He also rejects that strong and fundamental criticism of Israel would be a form of antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.no/meninger/debatt/article290020.ece “Israel og antisemittismen”], [[Bergens Tidende]] (17 August 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently involved in the Norwegian branch of the international BDS Movement and works for a boycott against [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="nettkrigerne"/&gt;

Since 2007, Gule has studied a legal process in which he argues that there has been a miscarriage of justice. The case is about a Bangladeshi man (and former colleague of Gule), who is alleged to have abused his Bangladeshi wife seriously, including by hanging her up by the feet, four times. In his book ''Den fjerde opphengingen. Beretningen om et varslet justismord og en profesjonsstudie av aktøransvar'' (The fourth suspension. The story of a miscarriage of justice foretold and a study of the actors's professional responsibility) from 2010, the investigation, the experts' statements, the sentences and the role of the press are all reviewed in detail.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Den fjerde opphengingen.

After the terrorist attacks in Norway 22 July 2011, Gule has been interviewed and cited by both Norwegian and international media as a commentator on extremism, terrorism and multicultural issues, especially since he had “discussed” with [[Anders Behring Breivik]] on the website Document.no.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9547000/9547585.stm Today – Breivik's ideas 'shared by many'].

'''Lindley Darden''' (born 1945) is a contemporary [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]],&lt;ref name="Weber2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Marcel|title=Philosophy of experimental biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-9MSsqv5DwC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=26 September 2011|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-82945-8|pages=85–}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a research focus on the [[philosophy of biology]]. She received her Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1974 and B.A. in 1968 from [[Rhodes College]], and is currently Distinguished Scholar Teacher at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]].

==Research==
Darden's research has led to the publication of several books. In her 1991 book, ''Theory Change in Science'', Darden argues, ''contra'' [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]], that science is a self-correcting enterprise which progresses through a thoroughly piecemeal process of "reiterative refinement," consisting of three stages: (1) theory construction, (2) theory assessment, and (3) theory modification. Although there are similarities between stages (1) and (2) and the traditionally recognized contexts of scientific discovery and justification, Darden argues that her stages are not easily mapped onto this dichotomy.

Furthermore, Darden attempts to illumine the "mysterious" process of constructing scientific theories by positing various "strategies" that she claims are sufficient for solving actual historical cases of theory change. For example, Darden examines the [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]]ian "Theory of the Gene," which underwent significant theoretical modifications from around 1900 (when Mendel was "rediscovered") to 1926 (when [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] published his famous textbook defining Mendelian theory in its roughly modern form). Looking at these cases, Darden describes procedures for devising the hypotheses that early twentieth-century Mendelian theorists actually proposed, although she does not claim that these theorists actually employed such procedures, or ''strategies''. Ultimately, by constructing a list of such strategies for discovery, Darden hopes that scientists can use them to solve present theoretical problems that contemporary science encounters. As such, she ''advises'' scientists to use them, calling her model "advisory" (rather than "descriptive" or "normative").

Darden has also worked on [[mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]], notably in her collaborative paper entitled "Thinking about Mechanisms" (2000), co-authored with [[Peter K. Machamer|Peter Machamer]] and Carl Craver. In 2006, Darden completed her second book, entitled ''Reasoning in Biological Discoveries: Essays on Mechanisms, Interfield Relations, and Anomaly Resolution''. In it, Darden propounds a number of strategies for discovering mechanisms in biology, including "Schema Instantiation," "Modular Subassembly," and "Forward/Backward Chaining."

'''Marian Hillar''' is an American philosopher, theologian, linguist, and scientist.  He is a recognized authority on [[Michael Servetus]] and together with classicist and political theorist, C. A. Hoffman, translated the major works of Michael Servetus from Latin into English for the first time. He identified the radical search for truth and the right for freedom of conscience as Servetus' main legacies, rather than his theology and scientific discovery. He studied the influence of Servetus in the world and the development and ideas of the [[Socinian]] movement in the 16th and 17th centuries, precursors of the Enlightenment and modern era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Reli/ReliHill.htm "The Philosophical Legacy of the 16th and 17th Century Socinians: Their Rationality", The Proceedings of the Twentieth World Congress of Philosophy, at the XXth World Congress of Philosophy, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt; He does research in the [[history of ideas]] and is author of numerous studies in the history of philosophy, ethics, theological doctrines, and Radical Reformation.

==Biography==
Marian Hillar was born in 1938 in [[Bydgoszcz]] (present-day Poland) in an old family claiming its roots in 14th-century Holland.&lt;ref&gt;Agnieszka Nietresta, "Malgorzata Hillar: Szkic Monograficzny", Wydawnictwo Homini, Krakow, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He received classical education in highly selective elementary and secondary schools with emphasis on science and languages. He earned his degrees at the Medical University of Gdansk and studied at the [[Jagiellonian University]] and at Sorbonne. He was invited in 1969 to do research at [[Baylor College of Medicine]] in Houston. He became a US citizen in 1977. He did research and taught in Europe at the Medical University of Gdansk and the Università degli studi di Camerino, and in the USA at the Baylor College of Medicine and the Ponce School of Medicine. He is currently professor of philosophy and religious studies, and he is director of the Center for Philosophy and Socinian Studies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socinian.org/ Center for Philosophy and Socinian Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; which he founded in 1986.

==History of philosophy and religion==
Marian Hillar has published studies on the philosophy of Hippocratic medicine; Greek  philosophy of  science and the origin of science; ancient Greek philosophy; liberation theology; the New Testament, Dead Sea Scrolls, early Christian writers, and the origin of Christianity; Philo of Alexandria, Numenius, early church fathers and development of  the theory of logos and of the Trinity; studies in ethics- Stoics, Thomas Aquinas, Kant; Radical Reformation and development of antitrinitrian doctrines, Socinians; development of modern ideas on freedom of conscience and church-state separation.

==Development of  the theory of logos and of the Trinity==
Hillar's major theological work is demonstrating how the doctrine of the Trinity was developed from various sources through the evolution of the Jewish messianic expectations which underwent changes during centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socinian.org/files/hillar_logos_trinity_thesis.pdf The Evolution of the Doctrine of Trinity in Early Christianity: Logos Doctrine and the Egyptian Divine Metaphysics as the Sources of the Tertullian Doctrine of the Trinity]&lt;/ref&gt; He identified as its sources the Greek philosophical concept of the Logos, Middle Platonic philosophical ideas, especially of Numenius and Philo of Alexandria, and the Egyptian religious ideas about the trinity of divinity.

==Editorship==
Hillar is founder and was editor-in-chief (1992-2012) of the ''Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essaysinhumanism.org/archive.html Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism]&lt;/ref&gt; a scholarly journal published yearly since 1992 by the Humanists of Houston. In 2005, the [[American Humanist Association]], Washington, D.C., agreed to assume the duties of publishing the journal under its aegis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6936">'''Michael Peter Davis''' (born December 19, 1947) is an American philosopher who teaches at [[Sarah Lawrence College]].

==Life==

Davis earned his A.B. in Philosophy and Government at Cornell University, where he studied with [[Allan Bloom]], and his Ph.D. in philosophy at Pennsylvania State University, where he wrote a dissertation, ''The Duality of Soul in Plato’s'' Philebus, under the direction of Richard Kennington. He taught briefly at Dickinson College, Wesleyan University, and Alfred University, before moving to [[Sarah Lawrence College]], Bronxville, NY, where he has taught since 1977 and held the Sara Yates Exley Chair in Teaching Excellence.  From 1981-89 Davis taught philosophy in the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research and from 1995-2002 in the Graduate Program in Political Theory at Fordham University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sarahlawrence.edu/search/?q=Michael+Davis|title=Search SarahLawrence.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flannery|first1=Christopher|title=Review of Wonderlust|url=http://www.claremont.org/crb/article/712/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/98353.pd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970’s Davis began a long association and friendship with [[Seth Benardete]], of whose thought he is one of the principal interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blitz|first1=Mark|title="At Homer's Diner: Conversations with Seth Benardete"|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/at-homers-diner/article/3707|publisher=The Weekly Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rothstein|first1=Edward|title=Shelf Life; A Classicist's Starting Point: Putting Aside Interpretation|url=&lt;https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/16/books/shelf-life-a-classicist-s-starting-point-putting-aside-interpretations.html&gt;|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Michael|title=The Eccentric Core: The Thought of Seth Benardete|date=2017|publisher=St. Augustine's Press|location=South Bend, IN|pages=103–126, 224–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benardete|first1=Seth|title=The Argument of the Action|date=2000|publisher=U.

==Academic work==

Michael Davis works primarily in Greek philosophy, in moral and political philosophy, and in what might be called the “poetics” of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Udoff, Portnoff, Yaffe|title=The Companionship of Books|date=2012|publisher=Lexington|location=Lanham, MD|pages=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the translator, with Seth Benardete, of Aristotle’s On Poetics and has written on variety of philosophers from Plato to Heidegger and of literary figures ranging from Homer and the Greek tragedians to Saul Bellow and Tom Stoppard. Davis is probably best known for his interpretations of Aristotle, where he articulates the metaphysical implications of practical life (The Poetry of Philosophy, The Politics of Philosophy, and The Soul of the Greeks) as well as the practical implications of metaphysics (The Autobiography of Philosophy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Stephen|title=Review of The Politics of Philosophy|journal=Choice|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howland|first1=Jacob|title=Review of Aristotle's  Poetics: The Poetry of Philosophy|url=http://muse.jhu.edu.remote.slc.edu/article/226023/pdf|website=Journal of the History of Philosophy|accessdate=April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other primary influence on Davis’s thought is [[Plato]], for whom the necessary connection between the practical and the theoretical shows up in the dialogic form of philosophy. For Davis, Plato reveals both the necessarily poetic character of philosophy  and the necessarily philosophic character of the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradley|first1=Octavian|title=Review of The Soul of the Greeks|url=http://muse.jhu.edu.remote.slc.edu/article/226023/pdf|website=Bryn Mawr Classical Review|accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mansfield|first1=Harvey|title=Review of The Soul of the Greeks|url=https://spectator.org/34349_books-christmas/&gt;|website=The American Spectator|accessdate=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Plato Davis learns that and how philosophy must be esoteric, not primarily in a political but in a metaphysical sense, a view he developed in conversation and collaboration with Seth Benardete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckert|first1=Michael|title="Straussians" in The Cambridge Companion to Leo Strauss|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

'''Mōsi Keeranār''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: மோசி கீரனார்) was a poet of the [[Sangam period]], to whom 10 verses of the Sangam literature have been attributed, including verse 27 of the [[Tiruvalluva Maalai]].&lt;ref name="Vedanayagam_Urai"&gt;{{cite book

There were two poets with the name "Mosikeeranar". One source has it that the statement about "Murasukattil" is not attributed to the author of verse 27 of the Tiruvalluva Maalai, but to another poet with the same name who lived earlier. If this was confirmed, the 9 Sangam verses would be attributed to the older Mosikeeranar, for whom a new article needs to be created. We still need to refer to more sources. Have retained this temporarily as other editors can check this, too. We can retain/remove this line once it is confirmed by more sources. Thanks. User:Rasnaboy--&gt;

==Contribution to the Sangam literature==
Mosikeeranar has written 9 verses, including 1 in [[Agananuru]] (verse 392), 2 in [[Kurunthogai]] (verses 59 and 84), 1 in [[Natrinai]], and 5 in [[Purananuru]], besides the one in [[Tiruvalluva Maalai]].&lt;ref name="SangaIlakkiyam_2"/&gt;

'''Nikolai Vladimirovich Stankevich''' ({{Lang-ru|link=no|Никола́й Влади́мирович Станке́вич}}) ({{OldStyleDate|October 9|1813|September 27}} – {{OldStyleDate|July 7|1840|June 25}}) was a Russian public figure, philosopher, and poet.

==Biography==
Nikolay Stankevich was born in [[Alexeyevsky District, Belgorod Oblast|Uderevka]], [[Voronezh Governorate]], and in 1834 graduated from the [[Moscow State University]], where he was influenced by Professor [[Mikhail Kachenovsky]] and followers of the so-called "skeptical school" in [[historiography]]. By late 1831, Stankevich had organized a literary and philosophical society called the ''Circle of Stankevich''. He had been under police surveillance since 1833 due to his connections with a group of oppositionary university students led by Ya.I. Kostenetsky.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Hans, ''The Russian Tradition in Education'', [[Routledge]], 2002, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In 1837, Nikolay Stankevich had to travel abroad due to his [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Bushkovitch, ''A Concise History of Russia'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 2011, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Stankevich's literary and esthetical views, most of which mirrored the ideas of a Russian historian [[Nikolai Nadezhdin]], presupposed the humanistic [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] as the main task of the Russian [[intelligentsia]]. Stankevich is known to have considerably influenced some of the Russian and [[Moscow|Muscovite]] intelligentsia in particular, including [[Vissarion Belinsky]], [[Timofey Granovsky]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]], and [[Alexander Herzen]]. Among Stankevich's literary works (mostly poetic and not numerous), there are a few verses dedicated to Moscow and a historical tragedy called ''Vasili Shuisky''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zpu-journal.ru/en/journal/contents/2012/4/Svalov_Stankevichs-Tragedy-Vasiliy-Shuiskiy/ Svalov A. N. On N. V. Stankevich's Tragedy "Vasiliy Shuiskiy" (The Academy of Social Sciences, Moscow)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died, aged 26, in [[Novi Ligure]], Italy.

'''Nikolay Mikhailovich Yazykov''' ({{lang-ru|Никола́й Миха́йлович Язы́ков}}, March 4, 1803, [[Simbirsk]], Russian Empire – December 26, 1846, Moscow, Russian Empire) was a Russian poet and [[Slavophile]] who in the 1820s rivalled [[Alexander Pushkin]] and [[Yevgeny Baratynsky]] as the most popular poet of his generation.

==Biography==
Yazykov was born in [[Simbirsk]] to an old family of Russian landlords. His first verses appeared in print in 1819. For seven years (1822-1829) Yazykov studied at the philosophy department of [[Dorpat University]], where he made himself famous with his riotously [[Anacreontic verse]] in praise of the students' merry life. For his summer vacations he went to [[Trigorskoye]], where he met Pushkin.

After leaving Dorpat, without a degree, Yazykov lived between Moscow and his Simbirsk estate. Later in life, he became intimate with the nationalist and Slavophile circles of Moscow, which held his poetry in high esteem. [[Nikolay Gogol]], in particular, favoured Yazykov over all other living poets. The young idealists grouping around [[Nikolai Stankevich]], however, dismissed his work as contemptibly lacking in ideas.

Yazykov's health, undermined by the excesses of his student life, began to fail very early, and from about 1835 he was a restless wanderer from one health resort to another. The Genoese [[Italian Riviera|Riviera]], [[Nice]], [[Gastein]], and other German [[spa]]s are the frequent background of his later verse. His spare time was devoted to collecting Russian folk poetry, in which task he was assisted by [[Pyotr Kireyevsky]].

Apart from Pushkin, Yazykov was also close to [[Nikolay Gogol]] and was [[Aleksey Khomyakov|Khomyakov]]'s brother-in-law. It was the death of his sister that triggered Gogol's fatal depression. According to his wishes, the great novelist was buried next to the Yazykovs in the [[Danilov Monastery]]. In 1931 the remains of Yazykov, Gogol and Khomyakov were reburied at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].

[[D.S. Mirsky]] compared Yazykov to [[Gavrila Derzhavin]] for "his power of seeing nature as an orgy of light and color". Pushkin once joked that the [[Castalian Spring|Castalian fount]] of which Yazykov drank ran not with water, but with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. Indeed, his early (and best known) poetry is devoted to the praise of wine and merrymaking, producing an effect of the almost physical intoxication and verbal rush.

'''Paul Weiss''' ({{IPAc-en|w|aɪ|s}}; May 19, 1901 – July 5, 2002) was an American [[philosopher]]. He was the founder of ''[[Review of Metaphysics|The Review of Metaphysics]]'' and the [[Metaphysical Society of America]].

==Background==
Paul Weiss grew up on the [[Lower East Side]] of New York City. His father, Samuel Weiss (d. 1917), was a Hungarian emigrant who moved from Europe in the 1890s. He worked as a tinsmith, a coppersmith, and a boilermaker. Paul Weiss's mother, Emma Rothschild (Weiss) (d. 1915), was a German emigrant who worked as a servant until she married Samuel. Born into a Jewish family, Paul lived among other Jewish families in a working-class neighborhood in the Yorkville section of Manhattan. Originally given the Hebrew name "Peretz," Weiss says in his autobiography that the name "Paul" was his "registered name" and "part of his mother's attempt to move upward in the American world."&lt;ref name="Weiss_1995"&gt;Weiss, Paul. The Philosophy of Paul Weiss. Ed. Lewis Hahn. Chicago : Open Court, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; He had three brothers, two older and one younger.

Weiss graduated from Public School #77. He later enrolled at the High School of Commerce where he learned shorthand and how to type; however, he felt that he did not benefit much from the available courses. His grades began to fall, and with a little encouragement from his mother, he eventually dropped out of high school.&lt;ref name="Weiss_1995"/&gt; After working many odd jobs, Weiss enrolled at the College of the City of New York in 1924. He took free night classes in philosophy, graduating cum laude in 1927. At the College of the City of New York, he studied with [[Morris R. Cohen]], who awakened in him an interest in the American pragmatist and logician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. During this period he also met Victoria Brodkin (d. 1953), whom he later married on October 27, 1928. They had two children: Judith, who was born in 1935, and Jonathan, who was born in 1939.

Upon receiving his B.A. from the [[City College of New York]], Weiss immediately enrolled at [[Harvard]] where he studied philosophy under [[Étienne Gilson]], [[William Ernest Hocking]], [[C. I. Lewis]], [[Ralph Barton Perry]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. Under the direction of Whitehead, Weiss received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1929. Weiss's first semester at Harvard proved to be a busy one. He volunteered to help [[Charles Hartshorne]] in the monumental task of editing the thousands of scattered pages Charles S. Peirce had left behind for publication by [[Harvard University Press]]. C. I. Lewis, who was at the time the department chair of philosophy at Harvard, eventually approved Weiss to work alongside Hartshorne for the remainder of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Castiglione, Robert L. "Paul Weiss (1901–2002). Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers Vol. 4. Ed. Shook. England. Thoemmes. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The first six volumes of Peirce's work were published between 1931 and 1935.&lt;ref name="lost_in_thought"&gt;Weiss, Paul. "Lost in Thought: Alone with Others." The Library of Living Philosophers Vol. 23: The Philosophy of Paul Weiss. Ed. L.E. Hahn. Chicago. Open Court. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Weiss was mainly responsible for the second, third, and fourth volumes. Two more volumes edited by Arthur Burks appeared in the 1950s. Weiss later founded the scholarly journal ''[[Review of Metaphysics|The Review of Metaphysics]]'' in 1947 and the [[Metaphysical Society of America]] in 1950.

==Teaching==
In 1931 Paul Weiss left Harvard and began teaching philosophy at Bryn Mawr. As Weiss explains, Bryn Mawr was at the time "the self-chosen destination of the most intellectual, intelligent, determined, and well-prepared young women in America."&lt;ref name="lost_in_thought"/&gt; Some fifteen years later in 1946, Weiss was invited to teach at [[Yale University|Yale]] for a term as a substitute for [[Brand Blanshard]]. He accepted and what began as a temporary job turned into a permanent position that lasted for twenty four years. Weiss was the first Jewish full professor at Yale. He comments that his experience at Yale was quite different from Bryn Mawr. "I was there faced with men—no women were enrolled in the undergraduate school until more than two decades later—many of whom had just returned from military service. They were older, some having gone through searing experiences, no longer enjoying the cozy atmosphere of their preparatory schools. I seemed to be just the teacher they needed and wanted."&lt;ref name="lost_in_thought"/&gt; Weiss remained at Yale until 1969 when he reached Yale's mandatory retirement age. Shortly after, he was offered the Schweitzer Chair of philosophy at Fordham University, but the offer was quickly retracted, allegedly due to Weiss's age. Weiss challenged Fordham's decision in an age discrimination lawsuit, but in the end he lost. In the early 1970s, Weiss began teaching at the [[Catholic University of America]]. In 1992 Weiss's contract with the university was not renewed. Again he felt that age discrimination played a role in the university's decision. Weiss and his son Jonathan, a lawyer and director of Legal Services for the Elderly in New York, challenged the Catholic University of America's decision. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigated the case and eventually ruled in Weiss's favor. His contract with the Catholic University of America was renewed until 1994 when Weiss voluntarily retired.

==The man and the philosopher==

As a philosopher, Weiss is mainly known for his metaphysical writings such as ''Being and Other Realities''. His other philosophical works include books and articles on epistemology and cosmology. He even published eleven volumes under the title ''Philosophy in Process,'' detailing his continuing and sometimes daily reflections over the years 1955–1987. A seminal point of Weiss's philosophy is that Being consists of a plurality of individuals that are unified by universality, which gives a structure to all there is, but that is also irreducible in four distinct ways.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Kevin. "Paul Weiss's method(s) and system(s)." ''The Review of Metaphysics''. Vol. 50. No. 1. (Sept. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; During his prime, Weiss maintained a style of philosophy that was considered by many to be out-of-date. In fact, Weiss opposed the philosophies of the [[Analytic philosophy|analytics]], the [[logical positivists]] and the [[Marxists]]. His was a philosophy on the grand scale-philosophical system-building in the style of Kant, Hegel, or Peirce.

As a man, Weiss could be "fierce in argument" while maintaining "gentleness" and "personal regard for his students." [[John Silber]], one of Weiss's former students says, "In order to study philosophy with Paul, one had to philosophize. And Paul's dialectical powers gave credence to Plato's account of those powers exercised by Socrates himself."&lt;ref&gt;Silber, John. "In Memoriam: Paul Weiss (1901–2002)." ''The Review of Metaphysics''.  Vol. 56. No. 1.  (Sep. 2002), pp. 253–254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Weiss died in 2002 at age 101. His final book, ''Surrogates'', was published shortly after his death. Most of Weiss's papers were donated to the Morris Library at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. After his death, his remaining papers and his extensive library (and also the legal papers, French and Russian translations, novels, and other non fiction books of his son) were bequeathed to the Institute for American Thought housed at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) and the IUPUI university library.

==In popular media==
In a June 13, 1968 guest appearance on the nationally televised ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tv.com/shows/the-dick-cavett-show/june-13-1968-1381706/&lt;/ref&gt;, Weiss argued that fellow guest [[James Baldwin]] was excessively focused on the Black experience. The exchange was featured in [[Raoul Peck]]'s documentary ''[[I Am Not Your Negro]]'', and described by [[A. O. Scott]] as the "initial spectacle of mediocrity condescending to genius is painful, but the subsequent triumph of [Baldwin's] self-taught brilliance over credentialed ignorance is thrilling to witness".&lt;ref&gt;Scott, A.O. "Review: 'I Am Not Your Negro' Will Make You Rethink Race", ''New York Times'', 2/2/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Godfrey-Smith''' (born 1965) is an Australian [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] and writer.

==Career==

Godfrey-Smith is Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at the [[University of Sydney]] and an Adjunct Professor of Philosophy at [[Graduate Center, CUNY|CUNY Graduate Center]]. He works primarily in the [[Philosophy of Science]] and [[Philosophy of Biology]].  Born in Australia in 1965, he received a Ph.D. in philosophy from the [[University of California, San Diego]] in 1991 under the supervision of [[Philip Kitcher]], and taught previously at [[Harvard University]], [[Stanford University]] and [[Australian National University]]. Godfrey-Smith was the recipient of the [[Lakatos Award]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/LakatosAward/lakatosawardarchive/lakatosaward2010announcement.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; for his 2009 book, ''Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection'' which discusses the philosophical foundations of the theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="Gewertz2007"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The philosophy of evolution: Godfrey-Smith takes an evolutionary approach to how the mind works|journal=Harvard University Gazette|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2007/02.08/03-godfreysmith.html|date=February 8, 2007|first=Ken|last=Gewertz}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection. Oxford University Press. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

His main research interests are in the philosophy of biology and the philosophy of mind. He also works on pragmatism (especially [[John Dewey]]), general philosophy of science, and some parts of [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]. 

He has criticized the arguments of [[intelligent design]] proponents.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey-Smith, Peter. (2001). [http://petergodfreysmith.com/PGSonDembskiWeb.pdf ''Information and the Argument from Design'']. In [[Robert T. Pennock]]. ''Intelligent Design Creationism and its Critics: Philosophical, Theological and Scientific Perspectives''. MIT Press. pp. 575-596.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Debating Darwin'' incident ==

In February 2011, Godfrey-Smith interrupted a talk given by Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, [[Jerry Fodor]] at the ''Debating Darwin'' philosophy conference held at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. In the heated exchange that followed, parts of which were captured on video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PqMD1vx-qk | title = Darwin Wars at UCSB Part 1: Peter Godfrey-Smith vs. Jerry Fodor | date= 19 Feb 2011 | accessdate = 13 Nov 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, Godfrey-Smith attempted to challenge Fodor on his views on the theoretical veracity of [[evolution by natural selection]]. Godfrey-Smith had already been critical of Fodor's views prior to the conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n13/peter-godfrey-smith/it-got-eaten | title = It Got Eaten | date= 8 July 2010 | accessdate = 13 Nov 2018 | publisher = ''London Review of Books'' | author = Peter Godfrey-Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Rafael Gambra Ciudad''' (1920-2004) was a Spanish philosopher, a [[secondary education]] official, a [[Carlist]] politician and a soldier. In [[philosophy]] he is considered key representative of late [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]]; his works fall also into [[Philosophy of Politics|theory of state and politics]]. He is best known as author of books focusing on secularisation of Western European culture in the [[consumer society]] era. As a politician he is acknowledged as a theorist rather than as an active protagonist, though after 2001 he briefly headed one of the Carlist branches.

==Family and youth==

Born and raised in Madrid, Rafael spent much of his childhood in Valle de Roncal and later cherished his [[Navarre]]se heritage; in historiography he is referred to as a navarro rather than as a madrileño, sometimes dubbed "maestro navarro", "arquetipo navarro", "buen navarro" or "vasco-navarro roncalés".&lt;ref&gt;''Boletín del Círculo Tradicionalista Carlista San Mateo'' 39 (1998), ''Rafael Gambra Ciudad 1920-2004'', [in:] ''filosofia.org'' service, available [http://filosofia.org/ave/001/a088.htm here], José de Armas, ''In memoriam.

==Scholarship==

In 1939 Gambra enrolled at the faculty of letters and philosophy at [[:es:Universidad de Madrid|Universidad Central]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rafael Gambra Ciudad 1920-2004'', [in:] ''filosofia.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by [[:es:Manuel García Morente|Manuel García Morente]] and [[Salvador Minguijón Adrián]],&lt;ref&gt;see Rafael Gambra, ''Aspectos del pensamiento de Salvador Minguijón'', [in:] ''Revista international de sociologia'' 67 (1959), pp. 85-88&lt;/ref&gt; he graduated in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;''Rafael Gambra, gran filósofo tradicionalista'', [in:] ''Fundación Nacional Francisco Franco''&lt;/ref&gt; One year later he entered Cuerpo de Catedráticos Numerarios de Institutos Nacionales de Enseñanza Media.&lt;ref&gt;Ministerio de Educacion Nacional, ''Catedra 1960-1961. Prontuario del Profesor'', Madrid 1960, p. 1021&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to Inspector Nacional de Enseñanzas Medias,&lt;ref&gt;María Teresa López del Castillo, ''La inspección del bachillerato en España (1845-1984)'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|9788436241457}}, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; in 1945 Gambra obtained his PhD laurels as Doctor en Filosofía, his thesis dedicated to post-Hegelian approach to historiographic methodology.&lt;ref&gt;titled ''La interpretación materialista de la historia (una investigación social-histórica a la luz de la filosofía actual)''&lt;/ref&gt; The work, promoted by [[:es:Juan Zaragüeta|Juan Zaragüeta y Bengoechea]], boiled down to highly critical review centred on [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Feuerbach]]&lt;ref&gt;see ''Sumarios y extractos de las Tesis Doctorales leídas desde 1940 a 1950 en las secciones de Filosofía y Pedagogía, Facultad de Filosofía y Letras, Universidad de Madrid'', pp. 61-66&lt;/ref&gt; and was published in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;''Rafael Gambra Ciudad 1920-2004'', [in:] ''filosofia.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the early 1940s Gambra assumed teaching at the Madrid Academia Vazquez de Mella, a semi-official Carlist educational and cultural enterprise; he was giving lectures on Traditionalist theory of philosophy, state and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Hernando de Larramendi 2000, pp. 59, 89-60, Larramendi 2004, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 he moved to [[Pamplona]], where he was employed by [[Instituto Príncipe de Viana]],&lt;ref&gt;Santa Cruz 2004, p. 175, Onésimo Díaz Hernández, ''Rafael Calvo Serer y el grupo Arbor'', Valencia 2011, {{ISBN|9788437087351}}, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; a cultural outpost of Carlism managed by the provincial authorities. During the next 12 years Gambra served in the Institute as professor of philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Hernández 2011, p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1950s apparently hoping to join a would-be Universidad del País Vasco-Navarro, a high-education establishment advocated at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Hernández 2011, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; However, when [[Universidad de Navarra]] materialized as a private [[Opus Dei]] enterprise in 1952, Gambra did not enlist; he rejected also an opportunity to pursue research and possibly scholarship in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;Díaz Hernández 2011, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1950s he returned to the capital,&lt;ref&gt;Santa Cruz 2004, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; engaged in governmental attempt to re-shape the secondary education structures.&lt;ref&gt;Gambra was highly critical of hitherto organization of the secondary education, writing: "lo peor de estos centros es su constitución misma, esto es, la forma como están concebidos y organizados. La estructura decimonónica, individualista y meramente oficial (...) el orden existente en un instituto es meramente reglamentario o externo; fundamentalmente, la mera sujeción a un horario de asistencia a clase (...) Los institutos se hallan montados sobre la sagrada independencia de cátedra (...) El claustro como entidad de gobierno, casi inexistente en la actualidad, no entiende tampoco de asuntos internos pedagógicos o educativo", quoted after Angel Lorente Lorente, ''Cincuenta años de regulación de las formas de coordinación docente en los institutos de educación secundaria'', [in:] Guillermo Vicente y Guerrero, (ed.), ''Estudios sobre la historia de la Enseñanza Secundaria en Aragón'', Zaragoza 2011, {{ISBN|9788499111759}}, pp. 402-403&lt;/ref&gt; He assumed teaching in newly created "centros modelos de segunda ensañanza", first in [[Instituto Miguel de Cervantes]] and in the mid-1960s moving to [[Instituto Lope de Vega|Instituto Nacional de Enseñanza Media Lope de Vega]],&lt;ref&gt;''BOE'' 186 (1964), available [https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1964/08/04/pdfs/A10151-10152.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; becoming its vicedirector later on.&lt;ref&gt;''BOE'' 155 (1968), available [https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1968/06/28/pdfs/A09495-09499.pdf here]; later the institute was renamed to Instituto Naciónal de Bachillerato Lope de Vega, ''BOE'' 284 (1977), available [https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1977/11/28/pdfs/A26079-26085.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; As education official he was anxious to prevent "erosión de la espiritualidad", and in the early 1960s he opposed technocratic changes, proposed and eventually introduced in education.&lt;ref&gt;Gambra claimed that "erosión de valores", and "erosión de la espiritualidad" might impair development and adversely affect equality of opportunities. Proponents of technocratic changes, J. A. Pérez Rioja and A. Abad, gained the upper hand, giving rise to the reform period dubbed "segunda sisactía", Emilio Castillejo Cambra, ''Mito, legitimación y violencia simbólica en los  manuales escolares de historia del franquismo (1936-1975)'', Madrid 2014, {{ISBN|9788436268645}} pp. 170, 671&lt;/ref&gt; He co-operated also with [[Universidad Complutense]], particularly with the associated [[CEU San Pablo University|San Pablo CEU college]], run by ACdP. Gambra continued collaborating with CEU from the mid-1960s to 1994,&lt;ref&gt;exact nature of this collaboration is unclear. None of the sources consulted refers to Gambra as "academic"&lt;/ref&gt; also after San Pablo had formally separated from Complutense and became an independent university.&lt;ref&gt;see cover info on Rafael Gambra, ''La Monarquia Social y Representativa en el pensamiento tradicional'', Madrid 2011, {{ISBN|9788435800426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from professional engagements, Gambra continued his teaching career also with a number of semi-scholarly institutions. Until the early 1960s Gambra was giving lectures at [[Ateneo de Madrid]], at that time led by [[:es:Florentino Pérez Embid|Florentino Pérez Embid]],&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 30.11.55, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1955/11/30/036.html here], also ''ABC'' 18.12.59, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1959/12/18/065.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[:es:Instituto de Cultura Hispánica|Instituto de Cultura Hispánica]], an establishment created by Francoist authorities to cultivate the Latin American link.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 17.11.66, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1966/11/17/087.html here], ''ABC'' 20.11.66, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1966/11/20/103.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the press referred to as "catedrático",&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 04.09.65, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1965/09/04/pagina-5/33559928/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; he was active in once-off conferences, also beyond Madrid,&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 11.03.55, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1955/03/11/025.html here], ''Ateneo Barcelones.

The principal thread of Gambra's thought is repudiation of rationalism-based civilization&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Ayuso Torres, ''El tradicionalismo de Gambra'', [in:] ''Razón española'' 89 (1998), p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; and promotion of a Traditionalist outlook. Human life is understood as commitment to divine order&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso Torres 1998, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; and human identity as spanned between own self and community belonging.&lt;ref&gt;de Armas 1965, p. 553, González Cuevas 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A man is perceived primarily as a social – not autonomous&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso Torres 1998, pp. 309-310&lt;/ref&gt; – being, expressed mostly by his role in society; similarly, life is about contributing to common good, incompatible with individualism or liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;also, Sartre and St. Exupery, Ayuso Torres 1998, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; The society itself is governed by nature, animality and rationality, though religion as a transcendent factor is indispensable element of social equation.&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso Torres 1998, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; Such a polity is best expressed as a "society of duties", united by common purpose and religious inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso Torres 1998, p. 307-8&lt;/ref&gt; As he believed a public organization not based on accepted orthodoxy can never be stable, leading to mere co-existence rather than community,&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso Torres 1998, p. 308, Bartyzel 2015, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Gambra advocated public embracement of the doctrine&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso Torres 1998, p. 307. He opposed the 1967 ''Ley de la Libertad Religiosa'' as opening the gates to "penetración protestante y judaica", Juan Antonio Monroy, ''Un protestante en la España de Franco'', Madrid 2015, {{ISBN|9781496404244}}, page unavailable, see [https://books.google.ru/books?id=m2DhBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT142&amp;dq=franquista+gambra&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=franquista%20gambra&amp;f=false here]. He perceived it as bowing to invasion of progressism and Europeisation, coming from Italy, France and the Vatican - Santa Cruz 2004, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; with respect for privately held heterodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;de Armas 1965, p. 553, Bartyzel 2015, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Marcel Lefebvre 1981b.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Marcel Lefebvre]] C.S.Sp.,&lt;ref&gt;for a sample of Gambra's highly sympathetic though not openly anti-Vatican rebellious views on Lefebvre see e.g. ''Algo más sobre Monseñor Lefebvre'', [in:] ''La Nación'' 14.06.95, available [http://www.larramendi.es/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;path=1021916 here]&lt;/ref&gt; picture from 1981]]
According to Gambra social self of a human is best expressed by tradition, viewed as accumulated and irreversible evolution that provides a principle governing historical societies&lt;ref&gt;at times this concept was applied to unlikely cases like a family saga from Colorado, screened on Spanish TV in the early 1980s, see Carmelo López-Arias Montenegro, ''In memoriam. Rafael Gambra. Rafael Gambra y el sentido del tiempo'', [in:] ''Anales de la Fundación Francisco Elías de Tejada'' 10 (2004), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; and incompatible with revolutionary patterns of change.&lt;ref&gt;Juan B. Vallet de Goytisolo, ''In memoriam. Rafael Gambra. La luz que agradezco a Rafael Gambra'', [in:] ''Anales de la Fundación Francisco Elías de Tejada'' 10 (2004), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; In case of Spain the tradition is embodied in hereditary monarchy as opposed to elective heads of state,&lt;ref&gt;he viewed elective leadership of state as hostage to ideocracy, Bartyzel 2015, pp. 132-3&lt;/ref&gt; federative structure&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso Torres 1998, pp. 310-311, Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''La continuidad ideológica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia], Valencia 2009, pp. 407-9, Bartyzel 2015, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to unitary nation states,&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 139, González Cuevas 2016&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corporatism|organic representation]]&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso Torres 1998, pp. 310-311&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to corruption-prone and individual-centred parliamentarian democracy,&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic orthodoxy as opposed to secular or neutral regime&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; and generally withdrawn admin structures as opposed to modern, omnipotent state.&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 140, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; Politically the guardian of such a tradition&lt;ref&gt;according to another summary, for Gambra the essence of Traditionalism was: 1) society as community united by common orthodoxy, 2) family as basis; 3) corporative purpose-guided structure (jerarquización teleológica); 4) subsidiarity principle of all public power; 5) organic representation, Bartyzel 2015, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; was Carlism,&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Ayuso Torres, ''El carlismo y su signo (a los 175 años)'', [in:] ''Anales de la Fundación Francisco Elías de Tejada'' 14 (2008), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; not merely political grouping or romantic sentiment but rather the very essence of Spanish self.&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso Torres 2008, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Recurring thread of Gambra's thought, by some considered its key component,&lt;ref&gt;González Cuevas 2016&lt;/ref&gt; was confronting modern format of religiosity. He held [[Maritain]] and [[Teilhard de Chardin]] responsible for undermining Christianity&lt;ref&gt;de Armas 1965, p. 555, Bartyzel 2015, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; and turning it into a "new humanist religion",&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Rafael Gambra, ''Maritain y Teilhard de Chardin'', [in:] ''Verbo'' 78-79 (1969), p. 781, referred after Bartyzel 2015, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; admitting defeat in 150-year-old struggle&lt;ref&gt;in case of Spain commencing in the 1821-1823 war, Ayuso Torres 1998, p. 311, Bartyzel 2015, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; against secular Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Jordi Canal, ''El carlismo'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|8420639478}}, p. 406; not to mention against Maurras, considered "tradicionalismo de izquierdas", González Cuevas 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Fiercely critical of [[Vaticanum II]]&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso Torres 2004, pp. 163-4, Santa Cruz 2004, p. 177; he later referred to the Council as ''Los heraldos del anticristo'', see ''Boletin de Comunion Catolico-Monarquica'' 11-12 (1985), available [http://www.larramendi.es/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;path=1021923 here]&lt;/ref&gt; he considered ''[[Dignitatis humanae]]'' incompatible with tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 289,  Mercedes Vázquez de Prada, ''El final de una ilusión. Auge y declive del tradicionalismo carlista (1957-1967)'', Madrid 2016, {{ISBN|9788416558407}}, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; the innovative effort of Vatican producing demolition of Christianity&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''El naufragio de las ortodoxias: el carlismo, 1962-1977'', Pamplona 1997, {{ISBN|9788431315641}}, pp. 148-150&lt;/ref&gt; and reduction of Catholic integrity to mere "Christian inspiration".&lt;ref&gt;López-Arias Montenegro 2004, pp. 167-8&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, he is often referred to as an [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrist]].&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 475, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 155. Gambra has not rejected the authority of Vatican; disillusioned about Paul VI, he noted that in John Paul I's public statements he heard about discipline, a word long forgotten in Vatican, and about faith instead of social problems, see ''El Imparcial'', available [http://www.larramendi.es/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;path=1022260 here]. Cautiously optimistic prior to the 1982 John Paul II's visit to Spain - see e.g. ''Siempre p'alante'' from 1982, available [http://www.larramendi.es/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;path=1022486 here], he assumed a decisively skeptical stance in the late 1990s. He was anxious about ecumenical activity of the pope, see e.g. ''Fuerza Nueva'' 1997, available [http://www.larramendi.es/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;path=1022014 here] or noted that while John Paul II in public hailed integrity of Italian state and spoke against separatism of right-wing Lega Nord, he has never supported Spanish territorial integrity and has never spoke against the left-wing Basque separatism, see ''Feurza Nueva'' 1996, available [http://www.larramendi.es/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;path=1022094 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with progressist stance of the Church, Gambra started assuming anti-clerical positions from the far-right perspective.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in ''El Pensamiento Navarro'' he lambasted clergymen for systematically turning sermons into subversive political lectures, apparently with no reaction on part of official ecclesiastical euthorities, referred after ''Mediterráneo. Prensa y radio del Movimiento'' 23.03.75, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=13&amp;path=5078613&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. Gambra's views on cardenal Tarancon were extremely critical and he did not refrain from mocking the head of Spanish church in public, compare an article with already abusive title ''La 'cana al aire' del cardenal Tarancon'', [in:] ''Fuerza Nueva'' 06.08.77, available [http://www.larramendi.es/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;path=1022305 here]&lt;/ref&gt; He often combined his critique with onslaught on European idea, considered a euphemism denoting a militant, anti-Christian ideology,&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; and opposed its implementation in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Santa Cruz 2004, pp. 175-6&lt;/ref&gt; He was not that much anti-democratic as rather opposing deification of democracy,&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. his ''La democracia como religión'', [in:] ''Roma'' 89 (1985), available [http://adelantelafe.com/la-democracia-como-religion/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; and especially the central if not exclusive position it claimed within public space.&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Most popular Gambra's works were textbooks in [[history of philosophy]]: ''Historia sencilla de la filosofía'' (1961) and ''Curso elemental de filosofía'' (1962); tailored for the beginners, they were reprinted in countless editions and served as immensely popular introductions to philosophy for generations of Spanish students&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 2004, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; until the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia sencilla'' was published by Rialp, related to Opus Dei, ''Rafael Gambra Ciudad 1920-2004'', [in:] ''filosofia.org''; some counted him among opusdeistas, Gregorio Morán, ''El Maestro en el Erial: Ortega y Gasset y la Cultura Del Franquismo'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|9788483100493}}, p. 125. ''Historia sencilla'' enjoyed 25 re-editions, while ''Curso elemental'' had 17 re-runs&lt;/ref&gt;  The first edition of ''Curso'' was nominally co-authored by [[Gustavo Bueno]]; in the subsequent re-runs the publisher dropped Bueno, who after the fall of Francoism claimed that the result of his own labor had been merely re-edited by Gambra.&lt;ref&gt;''Rafael Gambra Ciudad 1920-2004'', [in:] ''filosofia.org''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 these works were supplemented by ''La filosofía católica en el siglo XX''.&lt;ref&gt;186 pages, available online at ''funcacionspeiro'' service [http://www.fundacionspeiro.org/verbo/1970/V-83-P-167-186.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gambra's view on theory of society and state was laid out in three works: his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] dissertation ''La interpretación materialista de la historia'' (1946), ''La monarquía social y representativa en el pensamiento tradicional'' (1954)&lt;ref&gt;254 pages, available online at ''Fundación Larramendi'' service [http://www.larramendi.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;path=1022100 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Eso que llaman estado'' (1958).&lt;ref&gt;229 pages, available online at ''Fundación Larramendi'' service [http://www.larramendi.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;path=1021853 here]&lt;/ref&gt; ''La monarquía'', together with almost simultaneously published similar work of [[Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola|Elías de Tejada]],&lt;ref&gt;and titled ''La monarquía tradicional'', 1953&lt;/ref&gt; became a cornerstone of Traditionalist theoretical vision, while ''Eso que llaman'' was widely discussed in the press of the era;&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''ABC'' 01.05.58, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1958/05/01/054.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; both earned Gambra prestigious standing in scholarly discourse.

The works which made most impact among the wide public were 4 books focusing on contemporary culture: ''La unidad religiosa y el derrotismo católico'' (1965),&lt;ref&gt;190 pp, Rafael Gambra: ''La unidad religiosa y el derrotismo católico. Estudio sobre el principio religioso de las sociedades históricas y en particular sobre el Catolicismo en la nacionalidad española'', Sevilla 1965, available online at ''Fundación Larramendi'' service [http://www.larramendi.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;path=1022432 here]&lt;/ref&gt; ''El silencio de dios'' (1967),&lt;ref&gt;202 pp, available online at ''Fundación Larramendi'' service [http://www.larramendi.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1022249 here]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tradición o mimetismo'' (1976)&lt;ref&gt;320 pp, available online at ''Fundación Larramendi'' service [http://www.larramendi.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;path=1022299 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''El lenguaje y los mitos'' (1983).&lt;ref&gt;247 pp, available online at ''Fundación Larramendi'' service [http://www.larramendi.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;path=1022336 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The first two centred on secularization of Western polities; they confronted Christian-Democratic vision&lt;ref&gt;detailed discussion in de Armas 1965&lt;/ref&gt; and Vatican II alike,&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 2004, p. 163-4, Santa Cruz 2004, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; explored roots of perceived cultural decline, tried to re-define tradition versus progress&lt;ref&gt;''Rafael Gambra Ciudad 1920-2004'', [in:] ''filosofia.org''&lt;/ref&gt; and strove to demonstrate how multifold advances of the last centuries have given man a false sense of mastery.&lt;ref&gt;Oskar Gruenwald, ''The promise of inter-disciplinary studies: re-imagining the university'', [in:] ''Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies'' 26 (2014), pp. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tradición'' turned dramatically out of tune with the [[Spanish transition to democracy|transición]] spirit, withdrawn by the editor and distributed by the author himself.&lt;ref&gt;Santa Cruz 2004, p. 178, Goytisolo 2004, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, ''El lenguaje'' deconstructed modern communication; its objective was to prove that the progressist tide manipulated the language and turned it from means of communication into means of promoting cultural revolution.&lt;ref&gt;with particular attention paid to terms like "democracy", "equality", "evolution", "progress", "humanism", "human rights" etc, Ayuso Torres 1998, p. 305, Bartyzel 2015, p. 207. ''El lenguaje y los mitos'' provided a counter-reference to another book on public communication, issued a few years earlier and having been a lecture of media manipulation, elevated to the status of art and science; the book was fathered by former Gambra's disciple and Carlist collaborator turned his enemy, Ramón Masso, ''De la magia a la artesanía: el politing del cambio español'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from translations,&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand de Jouvenel, ''Du Pouvoir. Histoire naturelle de sa croissance'' (1956)&lt;/ref&gt; booklets,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Los tres lemas de la sociedad futura'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; compilations&lt;ref&gt;e.g. collection of his earlier essays ''La moral existencialista'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; and single though some of them original historical attempts,&lt;ref&gt;especially his ''Valle de roncal'' (1955, 71 pages) enjoyed a few re-editions, see online at ''Fundación Larramendi'' service [http://www.larramendi.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;path=1021839 here].

The work which attracted scholarly discussion was ''La primera guerra civil de España 1821-23'' (1950), referred to as "catastrophic interpretation of Trienno Liberal as conflict between the peasants and the liberals", Ignacio Peiró Martín, ''Días de ayer de la historiografía española. La Guerra de Independencia y la "conversión liberal" de los historiadores en el franquismo'', [in:] Pedro Rújula López, Jordi Canal i Morell (eds.), ''Guerra de ideas: política y cultura en la España de la Guerra de la Independencia'', Madrid 2011, {{ISBN|9788492820641}} p 458&lt;/ref&gt; most of 775 titles in digitalized version of Gambra's writings, released in 2002, are contributions to reviews and daily press.&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2004, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1940s Gambra was moderately engaged&lt;ref&gt;Gambra published 6 articles in ''Arbor'' and is referred to as "colaborador ocasional", Díaz Hernández 2011, pp. 43, 351&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Rafael Calvo Serer|Calvo Serrer]] directed ''[[:es:Arbor|Arbor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Prades Plaza, ''España y su historia. La generación de 1948'', Madrid 2014, {{ISBN|9788415444442}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he switched to ''La Ciudad Católica'', turned into ''[[Verbo (Spanish Christian review)|Verbo]]'', unofficial review of the Spanish Integrists,&lt;ref&gt;Santa Cruz 2004, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; contributing also to other Catholic titles like ''Tradición Católica'' or conservative ones like ''Ateneo''. He supplied a number of Carlist reviews and bulletins:&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 2004, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; ''Siempre p'alante'', ''La Santa Causa'', ''[[Montejurra (magazine)|Montejurra]]'' and ''Azada y Asta'', gradually eradicated from the last two by their progressist management.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 445, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Through many decades he was key author of ''[[:es:El Pensamiento Navarro|El Pensamiento Navarro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Santa Cruz 2004, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; During late Francoism and afterwards he collaborated with ''El Alcázar'' and ''Fuerza Nueva''. In the 1990s and later he appeared in nationwide press mostly as author of letters to the editor;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. see his voice on veterans, ''ABC'' 08.06.92, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1992/06/08/046.html here], or on Pedro Almodovar, ''ABC'' 08.11.95, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1995/11/08/016.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; his last item identified is from 2003.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 26.08.95, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2003/08/26/010.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s he engaged in private Carlist ventures Editorial Cálamo&lt;ref&gt;Larramendi 2004, p. 172; the publishing house was the first one in the Francoist Spain to refer to Picasso with respect, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; and Ediciones Montejurra.&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carlist: confronting Franco==
[[File:Entrevista entre Franco y el conde Ciano en San Sebastián en julio de 1939.jpg|thumb|160px|left|early Francoism]]
Released from the Carlist Requeté unit, during academic years in Madrid Gambra engaged in the Traditionalist Academia Vázquez de Mella.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 203-5&lt;/ref&gt; In the increasingly fragmented realm of post-war Carlism, headed by vacillating and hardly contactable&lt;ref&gt;first trapped in Vichy France and after mid-1944 detained by Gestapo in Dachau&lt;/ref&gt; regent [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]], he seemed leaning towards a candidature of [[Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza|Dom Duarte Nuño]]; the two had an amicable interview in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;Francisco de las Heras y Borrero, ''Un pretendiente desconocido. Carlos de Habsburgo.

Since emergence of pro-Francoist [[Carloctavismo|Carloctavista]] branch in the mid-1940s Gambra was increasingly anxious about protracted regency of Don Javier.&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, pp. 248-9&lt;/ref&gt; Uncompromising towards another collaborative branch, the [[Tomás Domínguez Arévalo|Rodeznistas]],&lt;ref&gt;in the early 1950s he demanded that collaborative Carlists are made to stand clear what they are for, Vázquez de Prada Tiffe 2011, p. 395&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1950s he concluded that Don Javier should reinvigorate the movement by terminating the regency and declaring his own claim to the throne. When this eventually happened in 1952, Gambra was co-author&lt;ref&gt;together with [[Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola|Francisco Elías de Tejada]] and [[Melchor Ferrer Dalmau|Melchor Ferrer]]&lt;/ref&gt; of ''Acto de Barcelona'', a proclamation issued by the pretender and viewed also as major re-definition of the Carlist dynastical reading.&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Vázquez de Prada Tiffe, ''El nuevo rumbo político del carlismo hacia la colaboración con el régimen (1955-56)'', [in:] ''Hispania'' 69 (2009), p. 193, Bartyzel 2015, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Books on Traditionalist monarchy established his firm position as a recognized party theorist. In 1954 he entered sub-commission of culture within Comisión de Cultura y Propaganda of the Carlist executive, Junta Nacional.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Vallverdú i Martí, ''La metamorfosi del carlisme català: del "Déu, Pàtria i Rei" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975)'', Barcelona 2014, {{ISBN|9788498837261}}, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

When discussing the mid-1950s some authors count him among the immovilistas, non-collaborative followers of [[Manuel Fal Conde|Manuel Fal]],&lt;ref&gt;Vázquez de Prada Tiffe 2009, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; while others scholars suggest he charged Fal with lack of intransigence and together with other Navarros like the [[Joaquín Baleztena Ascárate|Baleztena]] [[Ignacio Baleztena Ascárate|brothers]] he opposed him from even more anti-Francoist positions.&lt;ref&gt;Lavardin 1976, pp. 15, 18; others claim that differences were rather of personal nature, Ramón María Rodon Guinjoan, ''Invierno, primavera y otoño del carlismo (1939-1976)'' [PhD thesis Universitat Abat Oliba CEU], Barcelona 2015, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Once Carlism changed its strategy towards cautious rapprochement, Gambra stuck to his guns and lambasted the official collaborationist path of the new leader, [[José María Valiente Soriano|José María Valiente]].&lt;ref&gt;for 1956 see Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 67; for 1957 letter see Gambra's letter to Valiente, reading that "La política de acercamiento al régimen (o de acogida de un supuesto llamamiento del Generalísmo), que Ud. siempra ha propugnado, producirá, a mi juicio, [...] los siguentes efectos: 1) resultados políticos nulos; 2) situación de ridículo general ante el país; 3) desaliento, división y aun violencias graves entre los Carlistas", quoted after Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 293, see also Vallverdú i Martí 2014, p. 157; for 1958 see Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Uneasy about continuous vacillation of Don Javier,&lt;ref&gt;for 1955 see Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 33; in 1956 he edited a memorandum aimed against a would-be reconciliation with the Alfonsists, prepared in wake of rumors of Don Javier preparing such a deal, Vázquez de Prada 2016, pp. 37-38&lt;/ref&gt; Gambra was cautiously supportive of inviting his son [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|Don Carlos Hugo]] into the Spanish politics; he first met him in 1955&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; and though perplexed by unfamiliarity of the francophone prince with the Spanish affairs,&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 395, Lavardin 1976, p. 18, Bartyzel 2015, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; it was Gambra who introduced him at the 1957 Carlist gathering at [[Montejurra]].&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 416, Vázquez de Prada Tiffe 2011, p. 401, Lavardin 1976, p. 32, Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1950s Gambra appreciated his energetic style and focus on dynastic loyalty; he also liked young personalities from Don Carlos Hugo's entourage,&lt;ref&gt;for good initial relations between Gambra and AET see Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; especially [[Ramón Massó Tarruella|Ramón Massó]], a former Gambra's disciple from Academia Vázquez de Mella. Appreciating him as a young Catalan easily communicating with the crowd,&lt;ref&gt;"primero habla [in Montejurra 1956] un estudiante catalán, que tiene el acierto de coger enseguida la onda de la emoción popular y de hablar con frases breves y rotundas. El público entra de maravilla, aplaude, interrumpe, completa y redondea las frases del orador", quoted after Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; at the turn of the decades Gambra collaborated with Massó and others;&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; he did not realize that they exploited [[Mellismo|Mellist]] and federalist threads&lt;ref&gt;"La obra de Gambra sirvió de base teórica para quienes prepararon, adoctrinaron y lanzaron políticamente al primogénito de los Borbón Parma, Carlos Hugo", Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 361, 397-409&lt;/ref&gt; but considered him a rotten reactionary&lt;ref&gt;according to them, "Estas treinta o cuarenta páginas [of Gambra's work] sobran, no valen absolutamente nada", Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; and approached his teaching highly selectively.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 479-80&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in the early 1960s that Gambra realized that Hugocarlistas tried to outsmart the Traditionalists; having failed to prevent their increased presence in the party structures, around 1963 Gambra dissociated himself from Carlohuguismo to launch an openly confrontational bid.

==Carlist: confronting Progress==
[[File:Jaarlijkse bijeenkomst van Carlisten op de Los Angeles berg bij Madrid.jpg|thumb|left|Carlist meeting, 1966]]
In 1963 Gambra co-founded Centro de Estudios Históricos y Políticos General Zumalacárregui;&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú i Martí 2014, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; though affiliated with Movimiento Nacional,&lt;ref&gt;Jacek Bartyzel, ''Tradycjonalizm a dyktatura. Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola wobec frankizmu'', [in:] Marek Maciejewski, Tomasz Scheffler (eds.), ''Studia nad Autorytaryzmem i Totalitaryzmem'' 36/2 (2014), p. 7. In general, during the 1960s Carlism was tolerated as semi-legal grouping. When a formal case was lodged before the court by an Alfonsist monarchist, who indicated that Comunion Tradicionalista, noted in the press, is illegal organisation, the answer was as follows: "El Tribunal de Orden Público abrió el correspondiente sumario pero a la postre resolvió abstenerse de entrar en el fondo del asunto y archivar las actuaciones porque La Comunión Tradicionalista, según el Decreto d 19 de abril de 1937, integró con Falange Española una entidad de carácter nacional, en tanto se declaraban disueltas las demás organizaciones y partidos políticos, de donde se obtiene una legitimidad de origen y, por consiguiente, una imposibilidad de subsumir a dicha Comunión en las previsiones penales sobre asociaciones políticas, pues ni esta prohibida por la Ley ni ha dejado de cumplir los requisitos o trámites exigidos para constituirla. Añade que su actuación, como integrante del Movimiento y sometida a su régimen juridico, queda al margen de la Ley de Asociacines, por lo que cualquier irregularidad para poder ser estimada exigiria como requisito previo a modo de condición objetive de procedibilidad el que la misma fuese declarada por el propio Movimiento", quoted after Rodon Guinjoan 2015, p. 222-223&lt;/ref&gt; it was intended as a think-tank disseminating Traditionalism and countering [[Partido Carlista|progressist]] vision of the Hugocarlistas.&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 2008, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from publications and minor events,&lt;ref&gt;Centro issued also periodicals and organized so-called Jornadas Forales across the country, Bartyzel 2015, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; its activity climaxed in two Congresos de Estudios Tradicionalistas, staged in 1964 and 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 2008, p. 20, Bartyzel 2014&lt;/ref&gt; As supporters of Don Carlos Hugo were gaining momentum,&lt;ref&gt;starting mid-1960s the Javierista Montejurra feasts turned into massive public events, the largest in Spain save for official, religious or football gatherings. See the attendance numbers in Jeremy Macclancy, ''The Decline of Carlism'', Reno 2000, {{ISBN|9780874173444}}, p. 275: initially attracting few thousand attendants, in the early 1960s they attracted over 50,000 and in the mid-1960s over 100,000&lt;/ref&gt; Gambra was leaning towards rapprochement among all Carlist branches separated from the party during the last 20 years: Rodeznistas, Carloctavistas, [[Maurici de Sivatte i de Bobadilla|Sivattistas]] and the recently expulsed politicians like [[José Luis Zamanillo González-Camino|José Luis Zamanillo]] or Francisco Elías de Tejada.&lt;ref&gt;Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; Parking dynastical issues,&lt;ref&gt;Gambra was somewhat reluctant to oppenly challenge the aging Don Javier and tended to consider him incapacitated by Don Carlos Hugo, Ayuso 2004, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; they were supposed to be united by loyalty to Traditionalist principles and opposition to socialist penchant.&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; The plan did not work out until the early 1970s, it is until emergence of ephemeral structure styled as ex-Requeté organization.&lt;ref&gt;in 1972, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 231-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Gambra's efforts of the time were mostly about further refinement of Traditionalist thought in specialized reviews and conferences;&lt;ref&gt;organized by Catholic, Carlist, conservative and finally post-Francoist groupings: Ciudad Católica, Jornadas por la Unidad Católica, Homenaje a Mella, Centro Zumalacárregui, Patronato de Fundación Elías de Tejada, Priorato de la Hermandad de San Pío X, Movimiento Católico Español, Fuerza Nueva&lt;/ref&gt; they climaxed in ''¿Qué es el carlismo?'' (1971), concise lecture of the doctrine co-authored with de Tejada and [[:gl:Francisco Puy Muñoz|Puy Muñoz]]. Also in the mid-1970s he was very engaged in propaganda war with the Hugocarlistas. The latter lambasted his accord with "ultra-fascist line" of ''El Pensamiento Navarro''&lt;ref&gt;''Información Española'' 16.09.70, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=8&amp;path=3090288&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and his "posición ultramontana";&lt;ref&gt;''Información mensual'' 14 (1971), available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=3107568&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Gambra mobilized Traditionalists to challenge progressist grip on Carlism and prior to the [[Montejurra massacre|1976 Montejurra gathering]], which effectively produced fatal casualties, called for "asistencia masiva de los verdaderos tradicionalistas, que alcallará gestos y voces, 'declaraciones' y 'manifiestos', sencillamente inadmisibles, intolerables".&lt;ref&gt;''Por qué hay que reconquistar Montejurra'', [in:] ''El Pensamiento Navarro'' 04.05.76, quoted after Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 343-4&lt;/ref&gt;

During final years of Francoism and during transición Gambra, always opposed to Falangism and Francoism,&lt;ref&gt;"Gambra fue filósofo y escritor tradicionalista, siempre partidario firme de la línea no colaboracionista" - Vázquez de Prada Tiffe 2009, p. 187. According to one scholar, Gambra was the only firmy anti-Francoist among the 4 key Traditionalist theorists of the era, as Elías de Tejada moved from enthusiastic supporter to opposition, d'Ors has always been sympathetic and Canals displayed increasingly pro-regime penchant, Bartyzel 2015, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; neared the [[Búnker|post-Francoist búnker]]&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 2004, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; when confronting the change;&lt;ref&gt;starting the late 1960s Gambra criticised the regime for its increasingly liberal course, perceived as opening to laicism and inorganic democracy, see ''El Pensamiento Navarro'' 30.05.74, quoted after Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 166. Following the fall of Francoism Gambra began to view the regime mostly in terms of etatism, bureaucracy, dirigisme and technocracy, with falangismo, sindicalismo, nacional-catolicismo etc merely ideological smokescreen cover-up, Bartyzel 2015, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; voicing against the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|1978 constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;because the draft did not refer to God as supremr authority, Gambra with some 60 other pundits signed a letter calling to reject the project in a referendum, Bartyzel 2015, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; he sided with [[Blas Piñar|Blas Piñar's]] [[New Force (Spain)|Fuerza Nueva]] until the party was dissolved in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;''Rafael Gambra, gran filósofo tradicionalista'', [in:] ''Fundación Nacional Francisco Franco''&lt;/ref&gt; Embittered by ongoing change he tried to confront it in newspapers;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. he campaigned against legalising divorce, ''ABC'' 14.10.80, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1980/10/14/052.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; he compared the setting of late transición to that of the mid-1930s, when Spain was struggling infected with deadly political viruses.&lt;ref&gt;"hoy – en 1979 – nos encontramos ante un horizonte político tan sombrío como el que precidió el alzamiento de 1936", quoted after Canal 2000, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; He remained on the sidelines of politics; when mushrooming Traditionalist grouplets united in [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista (1986)|Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista]] in 1986 Gambra focused rather on youth Carlist organizations,&lt;ref&gt;indeed a number of young people admitted having been captured by his arguments, also on TV, see de Armas 2004, Víctor Ibáñez, ''Rafael Gambra y las Juventudes Tradicionalistas'', [in:] ''Anales de la Fundación Francisco Elías de Tejada'' 2004 (10), pp. 164-166, López-Arias Montenegro 2004&lt;/ref&gt; his spotlight on cultural heritage and education.&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 2004, pp. 164-6&lt;/ref&gt; His objective was to promote Traditionalist values in the increasingly secular, modern consumer Spanish society. 
[[File:1999-01-21 SAR Sixte de Bourbon CTG.jpg|thumb|[[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma|Don Sixto]], 1999]]
In the late 1980s and the early 1990s Gambra was considered supreme authority on theory of Traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;''Rafael Gambra Ciudad 1920-2004'', [in:] ''filosofia.org''&lt;/ref&gt; This was acknowledged during homage celebrations organized in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Santa Cruz 2004, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; though formal recognition came 3 years later. In 2001 [[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma|Don Sixto]], the younger son of Don Javier styled as Abanderado de la Tradición (though falling short either of claiming the throne or even claiming the Carlist regency) nominated Gambra chief of his Secretaría Política.&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 2004, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Not all the Traditionalists recognized Gambra's authority; the Carloctavistas and Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista - not admitting allegiance to any dynastical line - dissociated themselves from the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;''Rafael Gambra Ciudad 1920-2004'', [in:] ''filosofia.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming political leadership of the sixtinos Carlists, the 81-year-old considered his elevation another cross to bear, though as an octogenarian Gambra remained fairly active; his last public appearance took place during the [[Cerro de los Ángeles]] feast in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 2004, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|left|Carlist standard]]
Gambra emerged as a notable Traditionalist theorist in the mid-1950s. In the late 1960s he was already a recognized authority within the movement and beyond,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. he featured in Juan Rodríguez Ruiz, ''Traditionalism'', [in:] ''Enciclopedia de la Cultura Española'', Madrid 1968, vol. 5, pp. 456-459&lt;/ref&gt; with first homage sessions organized in 1968;&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 09.07.68, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1968/07/09/069.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; at that time his books on culture and Christianity earned him name also among wider national audience. With the commencing transición of the late 1970s his works went out of fashion up to the point of withdrawing them from bookstores.&lt;ref&gt;Santa Cruz 2004, p. 178, Goytisolo 2004, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 1983 publication of ''El lenguaje y los mitos'' he started to disappear from public discourse, publishing either in specialized reviews or partisan press titles.&lt;ref&gt;like ''Siempre p'alante'' or ''Fuerza Nueva''&lt;/ref&gt; Within Traditionalism he grew to an iconic figure, honored by 1998 homage session&lt;ref&gt;Santa Cruz 2004, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; and a monograph by [[:es:Miguel Ayuso|Miguel Ayuso]], published the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Ayuso Torres, ''Koinós: el pensamiento político de Rafael Gambra'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|9788473440424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he gained a number of prizes, all of them were awarded by conservative institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Premio Patronato Olave (1949), Premio Vedruna (1965), Premio Víctor Pradera (1973), Premio de Fundación Oriol-Urquijo (1975), Premio Manuel Delgado Barreto (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; His 2004 death was noted by some though not all nationwide newspapers&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''ABC'' 14.01.04, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2004/01/14/045.html here]; the Barcelona ''La Vanguardia'' did not acknowledge his death&lt;/ref&gt; and acknowledged by monographic issue of ''Anales de Fundación Francisco Elías de Tejada''.&lt;ref&gt;see online version available at ''Fundación Elias de Tejada'' service, available [http://fundacioneliasdetejada.org/anales/ano-x-2004/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taxonomy (general)|Taxonomy]] of Gambra's work is unclear. Today he is usually vaguely referred to as "thinker",&lt;ref&gt;"pensador", see e.g. Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, ''Tradicionalismo'', [in:] Javier Fernández Sebastián (ed.), ''Diccionario político y social del siglo XX español'', Madrid 2008, {{ISBN|9788420687698}}, p. 1172. Some authors almost explicitly admit difficulty in getting Gambra classified when they refer to him as "pensador tradicionalista en un sentido amplio", Edualdo Forment, ''El pensamiento cristiano'', [in:] Manuel Garrido, Nelson R. Orringer, Luis M. Váldes, Margarita M. Váldes (eds.), ''El legado filosófico español e hispanoamericano del siglo XX'', Madrid 2009, {{ISBN|9788437625973}}, p. 422, also "myśliciel" in Bartyzel 2015, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; an application used also by the Spanish press during his lifetime, alternating with "publicista", "catedrático", "profesor" or "ensayista".&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Francisco Vega Oncins (ed.), ''Gran Enciclopedia de España'', vol. 9, Zaragoza 1993, {{ISBN|8487544096}}, p. 4389&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to detailed designation his work is usually classified as philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Javier Castro-Villacañas, ''El fracaso de la monarquía'', Madrid 2013, {{ISBN|9788408036678}}, p. 47, Robert A. Herrera, James Lehrberger, Melvin Eustace Bradford (eds.), ''Saints, sovereigns, and scholars: studies in honor of Frederick D. Wilhelmsen'', Virginia 1993, {{ISBN|9780820419299}}, pp. xxi, Alexandra Wilhelmsen, ''La formación del pensamiento político del carlismo, 1810-1875'', Madrid 1995, {{ISBN|9788487863318}}, p. 108, Danilo Castellano, ''Patrie Regioni Stati e il processo di unificazione europea'', Roma 1999, {{ISBN|9788881148134}}, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; though some see it as part of historiography&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; or political science.&lt;ref&gt;González Cuevas 2011, González Cuevas 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In general Spanish encyclopedias he usually merits very brief notes.&lt;ref&gt;compare e.g. very brief entry in Oncins 1993, p. 4389; apart from basic facts from his biography, the note lists his major works but does not spare a single word on what his thought was all about&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophy-dedicated dictionaries ignore him,&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. a 4-volume series of José Ferrater Mora, ''Diccionario de filosofía'', vol. 2, Barcelona 2004, {{ISBN|8434405024}}&lt;/ref&gt; some just mention his name&lt;ref&gt;Heleno Saña, ''Historia de la filosófia española'', Madrid 2007, {{ISBN|9788496710986}}, p. 255; Gambra is mentioned in the chapter titled "Franco-falangismo y nacional-católicismo" as one of many authors whose principal aim was to provide "politico-philosophical coverage" to "Gloriosa Cruzada Nacional"; he is specified as belonging to "sector más especificamente católico"&lt;/ref&gt; and in few he is treated at length.&lt;ref&gt;Forment 2009, pp. 422-424&lt;/ref&gt; In some manuals he appears in entries dealing with Traditionalism, though featured as a secondary theorist who failed to provide original contribution and was rather a renovator&lt;ref&gt;"básicamente una renovación de los supusestos de Vázquez de Mella", González Cuevas 2016&lt;/ref&gt; of earlier thought.&lt;ref&gt;"actualizar las teorías de Vázquez de Mella", González Cuevas 2008. p. 1171&lt;/ref&gt; As a historian by some he is denied sound credentials, counted among pseudo-scientific "historiografia neotradicionalista",&lt;ref&gt;which demonstrated "scientific appearance based on erudition and sort of positivist illusion", Canal 2000, p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; others challenge this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza, ''Jordi Canal, El Carlismo'' [review], [in:] ''Aportes'' 45 (2001), p. 155; wider discussion also in Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza, ''La parcialidad de los historiadores españoles'', [in:] John Vincent, ''Introducción a la Historia para gente inteligente'', Madrid 2013, {{ISBN|9788497391351}}, pp. 9-38&lt;/ref&gt; As education official he is considered opponent of modernising technocratic changes.&lt;ref&gt;Castillejo Cambra 2014, pp. 170, 671&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes counted among members of "[[generación de 1948]]".&lt;ref&gt;among Rafael Calvo Serer, Álvaro D'Ors, Francisco Elías de Tejada, Gonzalo Fernández de la Mora, Antonio Fontán, Hans Juretschke, Juan José López Ibor, Vicente Marrero, Vicente Palacio Atard, Florentino Pérez Embid, José Luis Pinillos and Jaume Vicens Vives, see Antoni Raja i Vich, ''El Problema de España bajo el primer franquismo, 1936-1956.

Within Traditionalism Gambra remains one of the all-time greats.

==Biography==
[[File:Robert Baker Aitken and Anne Hopkins Aitken.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Robert Baker Aitken and [[Anne Hopkins Aitken]]]]
Robert Aitken was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in 1917, then was raised in [[Hawaii]] from the age of five.

Living in [[Guam]] as a [[civilian]] working in [[construction]]—at the onset of [[World War II]]—he was detained by the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and held in [[internment camps]] for the duration of the war.&lt;ref name="swans"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fields|first=Rick|title=How the Swans Came to the Lake: A Narrative History of Buddhism in America|year=1992|pages=201–202|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|ISBN=0-87773-631-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one such internment camp in [[Kobe, Japan]] in 1944 he met the [[scholar]] [[Reginald Horace Blyth]],&lt;ref name="swans"/&gt; with whom he had frequent discussions on [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[anarchism]]. At the conclusion of the war he returned to Hawaii and obtained a [[B.A.]] in [[English literature]] and an [[Masters degree|MA]] in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] from the [[University of Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="aitken"&gt;{{cite book| last =Aitken, Robert| first =Merwin, W.S.| authorlink =| title =A Zen Wave: Basho's Haiku and Zen| publisher =[[Shoemaker &amp; Hoard Publishers]]| year =2003| isbn = 1-59376-008-6| page =xi, xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="queen"&gt;{{cite book| last =Queen| first =Christopher S| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Engaged Buddhism in the West| publisher =Wisdom publications| year =2000| location =| pages =70–73| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn = 0-86171-159-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1940s, while going to classes briefly at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California]], he met [[Nyogen Senzaki]].&lt;ref name="prebish"&gt;{{cite book| last =Prebish| first =Charles S| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Luminous passage: the practice and study of Buddhism in America| publisher =[[University of California Press]]| year =1999| location =| pages =19, 20, 21| url =https://books.google.com/books?ei=4MpmTOS1FMLflgewioWgBQ&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;id=XsHv_5VCzmMC&amp;dq=0520216970&amp;q=Aitken#v=snippet&amp;q=Aitken&amp;f=false| doi =| id =  | isbn = 0-520-21697-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally in California hoping for an encounter with [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti]], he began to study with Senzaki in [[Los Angeles]]. It was during this period that his commitment to leftist social issues - such as [[pacifism]] and [[labor rights]] - became more vocal. As a result of his advocacy, he was investigated during this period by the [[FBI]].

In 1950 he went back to [[Japan]], under a [[grant (money)|grant]] to study [[haiku]] and followed Senzaki's recommendation that he study Zen there.&lt;ref name="swans"/&gt; There he took part in his first [[sesshin]] at [[Engaku-ji]], a temple in [[Kamakura, Japan]].&lt;ref name="swans"/&gt; Soon after, he met [[Nakagawa Soen]], who persuaded him to come for a stay at [[Ryutakuji]] for the next seven months. During this period Soen took over for the ailing abbot of the temple, [[Yamamoto Gempo]].&lt;ref name="swans"/&gt; Aitken then came down with a case of dysentery, and returned home to Hawaii. He married his second wife Anne Hopkins in 1957 and made occasional trips back to Japan. In  1957 Aitken met [[Hakuun Yasutani]] and sat with him for the first time.&lt;ref name="prebish"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Yasutani| first =Hakuun| authorlink =Hakuun Yasutani| coauthors =| title =Flowers Fall: A Commentary on Zen Master Dogen's Genjokoan| publisher =Shambala| year =1996| location =| pages = XXVI | url =https://books.google.com/books?ei=GWRlTNX4FcKB8ga326W7CQ&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;id=oGLYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Flowers+fall&amp;q=Aitken#search_anchor| doi =| id =  | isbn = 1-57062-103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Wenger| first =Michael| authorlink =Michael Wenger| coauthors =| title =Wind Bell: Teachings from the San Francisco Zen Center (1968-2001)| publisher =[[North Atlantic Books]]| year =2001| location =| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn = 1-55643-381-6| page =viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aitken"/&gt;&lt;ref name="queen"/&gt;

In 1959 he and Anne began a meditation group in Honolulu at their residence, which became known as the Koko-an [[zendo]]. The community that gathered at this zendo were then named the Diamond Sangha by the two. The Diamond Sangha has affiliate zen centers in [[South America]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] and is known for making the rigors of traditional Zen accessible to lay practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diamondsangha.org/|title=Honolulu Diamond Sangha }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diamondsangha.org/Links.htm |title=Affiliates of the Diamond Sangha |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110123641/http://www.diamondsangha.org/Links.htm |archivedate=2010-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 Soen Nakagawa Roshi asked young monk [[Eido Tai Shimano]] to travel to Honolulu to assist at the Diamond Sangha center.&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite book| last =Ford| first =James Ishmael| authorlink =James Ishmael Ford| title =Zen Master Who?: A Guide to the People and Stories of Zen| publisher =Wisdom Publications| year =2006| pages =114| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=-kut6gcyTNEC&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn = 0-86171-509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Aitken made an extended stay in Japan to study under [[Haku'un Yasutani]], eventually ending his studies with Soen. He then worked in various capacities at the [[East-West Center]] and the [[University of Hawaii]] until 1969, when he and Anne moved to [[Maui, Hawaii]] to found the Maui Zendo in [[Haiku-Pauwela, Hawaii|Haiku-Pauwela]]. Koun Yamada Rōshi was invited to lead the Diamond Sangha and he moved to Hawaii in 1971. In 1974 Aitken was given permission to teach by [[Koun Yamada]], receiving full [[Dharma transmission]] from him in 1985.&lt;ref name="prebish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chappell"&gt;{{cite book| last =Chappell| first =David W| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Buddhist Peacework: Creating Cultures of Peace| publisher =[[Wisdom Publications]]| year =2000| location =| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn = 0-86171-167-X| page =93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Aitken was a social activist through much of his adult life, beginning with protesting against [[nuclear testing]] during the 1940s. He was an outspoken critic of the [[Vietnam War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fields|first=Rick|title=How the Swans Came to the Lake: A Narrative History of Buddhism in America|year=1992|pages=256|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|ISBN=0-87773-631-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a strong opponent of the [[nuclear arms race]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. He was among the earlier proponents of [[deep ecology]] in religious [[United States|America]], and was outspoken in his beliefs on the equality of men and women. In 1978 Aitken helped found the [[Buddhist Peace Fellowship]], an organization that advocates [[conflict resolution]] globally.&lt;ref name="queen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burke|first=Daniel|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/national/american-zen-master-robert-aitken-dies/article_576cee2c-84fe-5dd2-a2b3-05ae1b84e4dc.html|title=American Zen master Robert Aitken dies|publisher=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=August 13, 2010|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''relationship between [[Rudolf Steiner]] and the [[Theosophical Society]]''', co-founded in 1875 by [[Helena Blavatsky|H.P. Blavatsky]] with [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and others, was a complex and changing one.&lt;ref name=Lindenberg&gt;Christoph Lindenberg, ''Rudolf Steiner. Eine Biographie. 1861-1914, 1915-1925'', 2 volumes, Freies Geistesleben, 1997, {{ISBN|3-7725-1551-7}}. pp. 487-8; p. 501; p. 326; p. 504&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, Steiner published an article in the ''Magazin für Literatur'', titled "[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] Secret Revelation", on the esoteric nature of Goethe's fairy tale, ''[[The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, ''Goethe's Fairy Tale, the Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily'', Steinerbooks, 2006, {{ISBN|0-88010-570-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article led to an invitation by the Count and Countess Brockdorff to speak to a gathering of Theosophists on the subject of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].  This invitation was followed by a second, the occasion of what he later considered to be his first fully 'esoteric' lecture, once again on the topic of Goethe's fairy tale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ahern]], ''[http://www.sun-at-midnight.com  Sun at Midnight: the Rudolf Steiner Movement and Gnosis in the West, 2nd edition]'', James Clark and Co, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-227-17293-3}}, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; 

Steiner continued speaking regularly to the members of the Theosophical Society, becoming the head of its newly constituted German section in 1902. The German Section of the Theosophical Society grew rapidly under Steiner's leadership as he lectured throughout much of Europe on his spiritual science.&lt;ref&gt;From the time of Steiner's appointment as General Secretary of the German Section, in 1902, to the secession of Steiner's new Anthroposophical Society at the end of 1912, membership of the German Section of the Theosophical Society expanded from a few individuals to sixty-nine Lodges.  [[Geoffrey Ahern|Ahern]], ''[http://www.sun-at-midnight.com  Sun at Midnight, 2nd edition]'', p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Through his lecturing to Theosophists, Steiner met [[Marie Steiner-von Sievers|Marie von Sievers]], owner of the Theosophical headquarters in Berlin, who was to become his spiritual partner and second wife.  From the end of 1903 Steiner and von Sievers became the inseparable centre of Berlin Theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ahern|Ahern]], ''[http://www.sun-at-midnight.com  Sun at Midnight, 2nd edition]'', p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 1904, Steiner was appointed by [[Annie Besant]] to be leader of an Esoteric School for Germany and Austria. Steiner made it clear that this school would teach a Western spiritual path harmonious with, but differing fundamentally in approach from, other [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|Theosophical]] paths. These and other differences with Besant became particularly pronounced at the Theosophical Congress in Munich in 1907—organized by Steiner—its focus on artistic expression was a sharp departure from the Blavatsky tradition.&lt;ref name="wn.rsarchive.org"&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c38.html  The Story of My Life, Chapter XXXVIII]'', 1928&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Quotation|Into the programme of the [Theosophical Congress of 1907] was introduced an artistic representation. Marie von Sievers translation of... [[Édouard Schuré|Schuré]]'s Eleusinian drama... [provided] an artistic element directed towards the purpose of not leaving the spiritual life henceforth void of art within the Society. 

A great portion of the old members of the Theosophical Society from England, France, and especially from the Netherlands, were inwardly displeased by the innovations offered them at the Munich congress. What it would have been well to understand, but what was clearly grasped at that time by exceedingly few, was the fact that the anthroposophic current had given something of an entirely different bearing from that of the Theosophical Society up to that time. IN THIS INNER BEARING LAY THE TRUE REASON WHY THE ANTHROPOSOPHICAL SOCIETY COULD NO LONGER EXIST AS A PART OF THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY.&lt;ref name="wn.rsarchive.org"/&gt;|Rudolf Steiner, Chapter XXXVIII, The Story of My Life'', 1928}}

Steiner's lecture cycles from 1909 onwards emphasized his research into Christianity, toward which Mme. Blavatsky had been notably hostile. Thus, the tensions grew between the main society and the German section. The relationship between the Theosophical Society centered in [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], [[India]] and its German section became increasingly strained as the new strains of Steiner's teaching became apparent.&lt;ref name=Besant&gt;[[Annie Besant]] tried unsuccessfully to prevent him from lecturing outside of German-speaking areas, indeed, even in [[Switzerland]], but protests came from the Society branches involved, and Steiner pointed out that the Society's statutes explicitly allowed him free rein. In 1910, Besant had written an article praising Steiner's work that ended, "Long may he live to guide the people whom he enlightens, and to carry his message through Europe," which made her change of position the following year more difficult to justify. Lindenberg, pp. 487-8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Steiner's popularity as a lecturer spread far beyond the borders of Germany: he was active in [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Austria]] and other countries. Besant tried to restrict him to lecturing in Germany itself,&lt;ref name=Besant/&gt; but this contravened both Theosophical Society statutes as well as a statement of Besant's greeting this broadening lecture activity, issued some months before. These tensions finally came to a head over the question of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], a young Indian boy to whom [[C. W. Leadbeater]], followed by Annie Besant, attributed messianic status as the new [[World Teacher]], an incarnation of the [[Maitreya|Lord Maitreya]]. Steiner quickly denied this attribution of [[messiah|messianic]] status to Krishnamurti, claiming that Christ's earthly [[incarnation]] in Jesus was a unique event. Steiner held that though the human being generally goes through a series of repeated earth lives, the [[spiritual being]] Christ incarnated only once in a physical body. Christ, he said, would reappear in "the [[etheric body|etheric]]" — the realm that lives between people and in community life — not as a physical individual. Steiner and the majority of the German-speaking Theosophists broke away to found a new group, the [[Anthroposophical Society]], at the end of 1912. Shortly thereafter, Besant revoked the German section's membership in the Theosophical Society on the grounds of the section's refusal to allow admission to adherents of a Theosophical organization established to support the mission of Krishnamurti, the [[Order of the Star in the East]]. Anthroposophists were offended when Besant falsely claimed that Steiner had been educated by [[Jesuits]].

The World Teacher concept was unpopular with many theosophists, and was repudiated by Krishnamurti himself in 1929, leading to a crisis in the Theosophical Society. It was, however, a basic principle of the Theosophical Society that adherents of all religions were admitted. 

As a result of the conflict, two steps followed in rapid succession:
*The overwhelming majority of German-speaking theosophists followed Steiner into the new ''[[Anthroposophical Society]]'', founded between August and December 1912.  In a telegram sent to the Theosophical Society they justified this step by stating it was: "based upon the recognition that the President [Besant] has continually and even systematically violated this highest principle of the Theosophical Society, 'No religion higher than the truth', and has abused the presidential power in arbitrary ways, thus hindering positive work."&lt;ref name=Lindenberg/&gt;
*Steiner's exclusion of Star in the East followers was a direct contravention of Theosophical Society statutes, and duly led to the charter of the German Section being revoked.

Steiner later claimed that he never had considered himself to be part of the Theosophical movement.&lt;ref&gt;In 1901, asked by Marie von Sivers why he didn’t join the Theosophical Society, Steiner is supposed to have answered that "there were more significant spiritual influences than oriental [[mysticism]]," and "it is certainly necessary to call into life a movement for [[spiritual science]], but I will only be part of a movement that connects to and develops Western esotericism, and exclusively to this." When the leader of the German theosophical branch, Countess Brockdorff, asked if he would not work with them, Steiner agreed under unusual terms: "Steiner evidently avoided requesting membership in the Theosophical Society, and made the condition that he would be released from all membership contributions. "‘Then I was sent a complementary “diploma” from England and became at the same time General Secretary of the German Theosophical Society.’" Lindenberg, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Already in 1897, well before the above-mentioned contacts, Steiner had clearly articulated his objections to the movement, criticizing it for "empty phrases" borrowed from Oriental texts and "inner experiences that are nothing but hypocrisy". One of his chief objections was that the Theosophists elevated the East's path to truth to the only possible one, thereby discounting modern science's approach to truth through reason and logic. See Rudolf Steiner, "Theosophen (Theosophists)", ''Magazin für Literatur'', 1897, Nr. 35, reprinted in GA 32: Rudolf Steiner, ''Gesammelte Aufsätze zur Literatur 1884-1902'', Rudolf Steiner Verlag, 2004, {{ISBN|3-7274-0320-9}}, p. 194-196.&lt;/ref&gt; Even while the leader of the German section of the movement, he made a great point of his complete independence of philosophical thought and esoteric teachings from the Theosophical Society's esoteric path.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Autobiography: Chapters in the Course of My Life: 1861-1907'', Steiner Books, 2006, {{ISBN|0-88010-600-X}}, Chapters 31-33.&lt;/ref&gt; His reaction to the above events was: "I myself experience what has happened — apart from what has been sobering and painful — as a great liberation from the oppressive narrowness that has characterized the life of the Theosophical Society for years."&lt;ref name=Lindenberg/&gt;

The basic structural skeletons of Steiner's [[cosmology]] and of his description of the human being as composed of various physical and spiritual aspects are based on [[Blavatsky]]'s schema,&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Quest Books, 1993, {{ISBN|0-8356-0238-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; to whom he acknowledged his debt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ahern]], ''Sun at Midnight: the Rudolf Steiner movement and the western esoteric tradition'', Aquarian Press, 1984, {{ISBN|0-85030-338-9}}, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Theosophy&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Theosophy: An introduction to the spiritual processes in human life and in the cosmos'', Steiner Books, 1994, {{ISBN|0-88010-373-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Autobiography'', Chapter 32&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner's elaborations of these (in his ''Theosophy''&lt;ref name=Theosophy/&gt; and ''Outline of Esoteric Science''&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''An Outline of Esoteric Science'', Steiner Books, 1997, {{ISBN|0-88010-409-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) diverge from other theosophical presentations both in style and in substance, however.

'''Sadiq Jalal Al-Azm''' ({{lang-ar|صادق جلال العظم}} ''Ṣādiq Jalāl al-‘Aẓm''; 1934 – December 11, 2016)  was  a [[Professor Emeritus]] of Modern European Philosophy at the [[University of Damascus]] in Syria and was, until 2007, a visiting professor in the Department of Near Eastern Studies at [[Princeton University]]. His main area of specialization was the work of German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]], but he later placed a greater emphasis upon the [[Islam]]ic world and its relationship to the West, evidenced by his contribution to the discourse of [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=izpNLWUxp5IC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;lpg=PA217&amp;dq=orientalism+and+orientalism+in+reverse&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LKFUOpx-N5&amp;sig=aS1UZfv30ji1fII1fLgSYR3Tpv0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Zs09TY-zA4rEsAP7jKmGAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Orientalism: A Reader|last=Macfie|first=A.

==Early life and education==
Al-Azm was born in [[Damascus]], [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|Syrian Republic]], into the prominent [[Al-Azm family]].&lt;ref name="Sadgrove 2010 loc=267"&gt;{{citation |last=al-Azm|first=Sadiq Jalal|year=2008|chapter=Science and Religion, an Uneasy Relationship in the History of Judeo-Christian-Muslim Heritage|title=Islam &amp; Europe|editor1-last=|editor1-first=|editor2-last=|editor2-first=|editor3-last=|editor3-first=|place=|publisher=Leuven University Press|page=129|isbn=9058676722}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Al-Azm family rose to prominence in the eighteenth century under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Greater Syria]].

Al-Azm was schooled in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], earning a B.A. in Philosophy from the [[American University of Beirut]] in 1957. Al-Azm earned an M.A. in 1959 and a Ph.D. in 1961 from [[Yale University]], majoring in Modern European Philosophy.

==Career==
In 1963, after finishing his Ph.D., he began teaching at the [[American University of Beirut]]. His 1968 book ''Al-Nakd al-Dhati Ba’da al-Hazima'' (''Self-Criticism After the Defeat'') (Dar al-Taliah, Beirut) analyzes the impact of the [[Six-Day War]] on Arabs. Many of his books are banned in Arab nations (with the exception of Lebanon).

He was a professor of Modern European Philosophy in the Department of Philosophy and Sociology at the University of Damascus from 1977 to 1999. He continued to be active in lecturing at European and American universities as a visiting professor. In 2004, he won the [[Erasmus Prize]] with [[Fatema Mernissi]] and [[Abdulkarim Soroush]]. In 2004 he received the [[Dr. Leopold Lucas Prize]] awarded on behalf of the Protestant Faculty of the [[University of Tübingen]] by Professor [[Eilert Herms]] with an address entitled "Islam and Secular Humanism" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0353-5738/2013/0353-57381301293D.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.polylog.net/fileadmin/docs/polylog/16_rez_Ben-Abdeljelil_Al-Azm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he became a Dr. Honoris Causa at [[Hamburg University]]. In 2015 he was awarded the [[Goethe Medal]] by the president of the Goethe Institute.

===Controversy and arrest===
Al-Azm was at the center of a political controversy in December 1969 when he was arrested ''in absentia'' with his publisher by the Lebanese government; he had fled to Syria only to later return to Beirut to turn himself in, where he was jailed in early January 1970. He was charged for writing a book that aimed at provoking feuds among the religious sects of Lebanon. This was after publication in book form of various essays that previously appeared in journals, magazines and periodicals. Together, they comprised the 1969 book, ''Naqd al-Fikr al-Dini'' (''Critique of Religious Thought'') (Dar al-Taliah, Beirut). In it, Al-Azm's rebuke of political and religious leaders and the media who supported them for exploiting their populations' religious sentiments was relentless and made him enemies. He applied a Marxist-materialist critique to religion, not to discredit people's religious commitments, but to expose how "Arab regimes found in religion a crutch they could use to calm down the Arab public and cover-up for their incompetence and failure laid bare by the defeat, by adopting religious and spiritual explanations for the Israeli victory...."&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to ''Naqd al-Fikr al-Dini''&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Azm was released from prison in mid-January 1970 after the "Court decided in consensus to drop the charges filed against the Defendant Sadiq Al-Azm and Bashir Al-Daouk due to the lack of criminal elements they were charged with." &lt;ref&gt;Appendix: Documents from the Tribunal of the Author and Publisher&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent editions of ''Naqd al-Fikr al-Dini'' include the Documents from the Tribunal and continue to be published in Arabic to this day, though with restricted access in the Middle East.

Al-Azm long believed his arrest was motivated by other factors, perhaps as a way to "settle scores with their critics and foes." Regardless, the arguments Al-Azm raised in ''Critique of Religious Thought'' continue to be debated, and there have been numerous books published in Arabic furthering the positions of both sides of the debate. The most thorough chronicling of the "affair", to use the author's own words, outside the Middle East was in the German journal, ''Der Islam,'' by Stefan Wild in an essay translated "God and Man in Lebanon: The Sadiq Al-Azm Affair" in 1971.[http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/islm.1971.48.2.206]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

===Prominent views===
Al-Azm was a critic of [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'', claiming that it [[Essentialism|essentialises]] 'the West' in the same manner that Said criticises imperial powers and their scholars of essentialising 'the East'. In a 1981 essay, Al-Azm wrote of Said: "the stylist and polemicist in Edward Said very often runs away with the systematic thinker ... we find Said ... tracing the origins of Orientalism all the way back to Homer, Aeschylus, Euripides and Dante. In other words, Orientalism is not really a thoroughly modern phenomenon, as we thought earlier, but is the natural product of an ancient and almost irresistible European bent of mind to misrepresent the realities of other cultures, peoples and their languages. ... Here the author seems to be saying that the 'European mind', from Homer to Karl Marx and A.H.R.Gibb, is inherently bent on distorting all human realities other than its own."

Within a decade, Al-Azm became an active participant in the dialogue surrounding free speech and the 1988 publication of ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' by [[Salman Rushdie]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2523">{{nihongo|'''Seiichi Hatano'''|波多野 精一|Hatano Seiichi|21 July 1877 &amp;ndash; 17 January 1950}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[Philosophy|philosopher]], best known for his work in the 
[[philosophy of religion]] dealing mostly with western religion and also western philosophical thoughts in theological aspects of Christianity.  

Hatano was born in [[Matsumoto, Nagano|Matsumoto]] in [[Nagano Prefecture]], and educated at [[Tokyo Imperial University]], from which he graduated in 1899.  He was very influential in stimulating the study in Japan of Western philosophy and religion, both through his teaching (he was the first to teach the history of Western philosophy at Tokyo Semmon Gakko, now [[Waseda University]]), and through his early writings.  These included ''An Outline of the History of Western Philosophy'' (1897), ''The Origins of Christianity'' (1909), and ''A Study of Spinoza'' (1904–1905). The last of these was originally written in [[German language|German]] and only translated into [[Japanese language|Japanese]] in 1910). It was reprinted after WW2.

He opposed a [[Positivism|positivist]] approach to religion, arguing that though [[rationality]] underpinned religious beliefs, it depended upon an autonomous form of [[experience]] to discover at least partial truth.

He died in [[Tokyo]] at the age of seventy-three.

'''Self-esteem'''   reflects an individual's overall subjective emotional evaluation of their own worth. It is the decision made  by an individual as an attitude towards the self. Self-esteem encompasses [[beliefs]] about oneself, (for example, "I am competent", "I am worthy"), as well as [[emotion]]al states, such as [[wikt:triumph|triumph]], [[depression (mood)|despair]], [[pride]], and [[shame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hewitt |first=John P. |title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=217–224 |isbn=978-0-19-518724-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith and Mackie (2007) defined it by saying "The [[self-concept]] is what we think about the self; self-esteem, is the positive or negative evaluations of the self, as in how we feel about it."&lt;ref name="SmithMackie"&gt;{{cite book |first=E.

==History==
The identification of self-esteem as a distinct psychological construct is thought{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} to have its origins in the work of philosopher and psychologist, geologist, anthropologist [[William James]] (1892).&lt;ref name="James1892"&gt;James, W. (1892). ''Psychology: The briefer course''. New York: Henry Holt.&lt;/ref&gt; James identified multiple dimensions of the self, with two levels of hierarchy: processes of knowing (called the 'I-self') and the resulting knowledge about the self (the 'Me-self'). Observation about the self and storage of those observations by the I-self create three types of knowledge, which collectively account for the Me-self, according to James. These are the material self, social self, and spiritual self. The social self comes closest to self-esteem, comprising all characteristics recognized by others. The material self consists of representations of the body and possessions, and the spiritual self of descriptive representations and evaluative dispositions regarding the self. This view of self-esteem as the collection of an individual's attitudes toward oneself remains today.&lt;ref name="James1892"/&gt;

In the mid-1960s, sociologist [[Morris Rosenberg]] defined self-esteem as a feeling of self-worth and developed the [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale]] (RSES), which became the most-widely used scale to measure self-esteem in the social sciences.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterSmartBoden1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Baumeister |first= Roy F. |last2= Smart |first2= L. |last3= Boden |first3= J. |year= 1996 |title= Relation of threatened egotism to violence and aggression: The dark side of self-esteem |journal= [[Psychological Review]] |volume= 103 |issue= 1 |pages= 5–33 |doi= 10.1037/0033-295X.103.1.5 |pmid= 8650299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the [[Behaviorism | behaviorist movement]] minimized introspective study of mental processes, emotions and feelings, replacing introspection with  objective study through experiments on behaviors observed in relation with environment. [[Behaviorism]] viewed the human being as an animal subject to reinforcements, and suggested placing psychology as an experimental science, similar to chemistry or biology. As a consequence, clinical trials on self-esteem were overlooked, since behaviorists considered the idea less liable to rigorous measurement.&lt;ref name="Bonet"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=iTwVTnXcuBcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false José-Vicente Bonet. ''Sé amigo de ti mismo: manual de autoestima'']. 1997. Ed. Sal Terrae. Maliaño (Cantabria, España). {{ISBN|978-84-293-1133-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the mid-20th century, the rise of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] and [[humanistic psychology]] led to renewed interest in self-esteem. Self-esteem then took a central role in personal [[self-actualization]] and in the treatment of psychic disorders. Psychologists started to consider the relationship between [[psychotherapy]] and the personal satisfaction of persons with high self-esteem as useful to the field. This led to new elements being introduced to the concept of self-esteem, including the reasons why people tend to feel less worthy and why people become discouraged or unable to meet challenges by themselves.&lt;ref name="Bonet"/&gt;

In 1992 the [[political scientist]] [[Francis Fukuyama]] associated self-esteem with what [[Plato]] called [[thumos | ''thymos'']] - the "[[spiritedness]]" part of the [[Plato's tripartite theory of soul | Platonic soul]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of | 1997}} the [[core self-evaluations]] approach included self-esteem as one of four dimensions that comprise one's fundamental appraisal of oneself - along with locus of control, neuroticism, and self-efficacy.&lt;ref name="Judge1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Judge |first= T.

===Self-esteem in public policy===
The importance of self-esteem gained endorsement from some government and non-government groups starting around the 1970s, such that one can speak of a self-esteem movement.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Nolan | first =  James L. | title = The Therapeutic State: Justifying Government at Century's End | url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-dRzYK1GugC | accessdate = 2013-05-06 | year = 1998 | publisher = NYU Press | isbn = 9780814757918 | pages = 152–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement can be used{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} as an example of promising evidence that psychological research can have an effect on forming [[public policy]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} The underlying idea of the movement was that low self-esteem was the root of the problem for individuals, making it the root of societal problems and dysfunctions. A leading figure of the movement, psychologist [[Nathaniel Branden]], stated: "[I] cannot think of a single psychological problem – from anxiety and depression, to fear of intimacy or of success, to spouse battery or child molestation – that is not traced back to the problem of low self-esteem".&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

Self-esteem was believed{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} to be a cultural phenomenon of [[Western Society | Western individualistic societies]] since low self-esteem was not found in [[collectivism | collectivist]] countries such as Japan.&lt;ref&gt;

Concern about low self-esteem and its many presumed negative consequences led California assemblyman [[John Vasconcellos]] to work to set up and fund the Task Force on Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility in California in 1986. Vasconcellos argued that this task force could combat many of the state's problems - from crime and teen pregnancy to school underachievement and pollution.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt; He compared increasing self-esteem to giving out a vaccine for a disease: it could help protect people from being overwhelmed by [[personal life | life]]'s challenges.

The task force set up committees in many California counties and formed a committee of scholars to review the available literature on self-esteem. This committee found very small associations between low self-esteem and its assumed consequences, ultimately showing that low self-esteem is not the root of all societal problems and not as important as the committee had originally thought. However, the authors of the paper that summarized the review of the literature still believe that self-esteem is an independent variable that affects major social problems. The task force disbanded in 1995, and the National Council for Self-Esteem and later the [[National Association for Self-Esteem]] (NASE) was established,{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} taking on the task force's mission. Vasconcellos and [[Jack Canfield]] were members of its advisory board in 2003, and members of its Masters' Coalition included [[Anthony Robbins]], [[Bernie Siegel]], and [[Gloria Steinem]].&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt;

== Theories ==
Many early theories suggested that self-esteem is a basic human need or motivation. American psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] included self-esteem in his [[hierarchy of human needs]]. He described two different forms of "esteem": the need for respect from others in the form of recognition, success, and admiration, and the need for self-respect in the form of self-love, self-confidence, skill, or aptitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maslow |first=A. H. |year=1987 |title=Motivation and Personality |edition=Third |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0-06-041987-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Respect from others was believed to be more fragile and easily lost than inner self-esteem. According to Maslow, without the fulfillment of the self-esteem need, individuals will be driven to seek it and unable to grow and obtain self-actualization. Maslow also states that the healthiest expression of self-esteem "is the one which manifests in respect we deserve for others, more than renown, fame and flattery".  Modern theories of self-esteem explore the reasons humans are motivated to maintain a high regard for themselves. [[Sociometer]] theory maintains that self-esteem evolved to check one's level of status and acceptance in ones' social group. According to ''[[Terror Management Theory]]'', self-esteem serves a protective function and reduces anxiety about life and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greenberg |first=J. |year=2008 |title=Understanding the vital human quest for self-esteem |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=48–55 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2008.00061.x |pmid=26158669 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-esteem is important because it shows ourselves how we view the way we are and the sense of our personal value.  Thus, it affects the way we are and act in the world and the way we are related to everybody else.&lt;ref name="Bonet"/&gt;

[[Carl Rogers]] (1902-1987), an advocate of [[humanistic psychology]], theorized the origin of many people's problems to be that they despise themselves and consider themselves worthless and incapable of being loved. This is why Rogers believed in the importance of giving unconditional acceptance to a client and when this was done it could improve the client's self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Bonet"/&gt; In his therapy sessions with clients, he offered positive regard no matter what.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wickman S.A. |author2=Campbell C. | year = 2003 | title = An analysis of how Carl Rogers enacted client-centered conversation with Gloria | url = | journal = Journal of Counseling &amp; Development | volume = 81 | issue = 2| pages = 178–184 | doi=10.1002/j.1556-6678.2003.tb00239.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the concept of self-esteem is approached since then in humanistic psychology as an inalienable right for every person, summarized in the following sentence:

{{cquote|Every human being, with no exception, for the mere fact to be it, is worthy of unconditional respect of everybody else; he deserves to esteem himself and to be esteemed.&lt;ref name="Bonet" /&gt;}}

==Measurement==
Self-esteem is typically assessed using self-report inventories.

One of the most widely used instruments, the [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale]] (RSES) is a 10-item self-esteem scale score that requires participants to indicate their level of agreement with a series of statements about themselves. An alternative measure, The Coopersmith Inventory uses a 50-question battery over a variety of topics and asks subjects whether they rate someone as similar or dissimilar to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/selfesteem.php#measurement|title=MacArthur SES &amp; Health Network - Research|website=Macses.ucsf.edu|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a subject's answers demonstrate solid self-regard, the scale regards them as well adjusted. If those answers reveal some inner shame, it considers them to be prone to social deviance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Slater |first=Lauren |title=The Trouble With Self-Esteem |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 Feb 2002 |accessdate=27 Nov 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/03/magazine/the-trouble-with-self-esteem.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implicit measures of self-esteem began to be used in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bosson J.K. |author2=Swann W.B. |author3=Pennebaker J.W. | year = 2000 | title = Stalking the perfect measure of implicit self esteem: The blind men and the elephant revisited?. | url = | journal = Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = 4| pages = 631–643 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.4.631}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rely on indirect measures of [[cognitive processing]] thought to be linked to [[implicit self-esteem]], including the [[Name letter effect|Name Letter Task]].&lt;ref&gt;Koole, S. L., &amp; Pelham, B. W. (2003). On the nature of implicit self-esteem: The case of the name letter effect. In S. Spencer, S. Fein, &amp; M. P. Zanna (Eds.), ''Motivated social perception: The Ontario Symposium'' (pp. 93–116). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Such indirect measures are designed to reduce awareness of the process of assessment. When used to assess implicit self-esteem, psychologists feature self-relevant stimuli to the participant and then measure how quickly a person identifies positive or negative stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hetts J.J. |author2=Sakuma M. |author3=Pelham B.W. | year = 1999 | title = Two roads to positive regard: Implicit and explicit self-evaluation and culture | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 35 | issue = 6| pages = 512–559 | doi=10.1006/jesp.1999.1391}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a woman was given the self-relevant stimuli of female and mother, psychologists would measure how quickly she identified the negative word, evil, or the positive word, kind.

== Development across lifespan ==
Experiences in a person's life are a major source of how self-esteem develops.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt; In the early years of a child's life, parents have a significant influence on self-esteem and can be considered a main source of positive and negative experiences a child will have.&lt;ref name="Raboteg 2014" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=Raboteg-Saric Z. |author2=Sakic M. | year = 2014 | title = Relations of parenting styles and friendship quality to self-esteem, life satisfaction, &amp; happiness in adolescents | url = | journal = Applied Research in the Quality of Life | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 749–765 | doi=10.1007/s11482-013-9268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconditional love from parents helps a child develop a stable sense of being cared for and respected.

Although studies thus far have reported only a correlation of warm, supportive [[parenting styles]] (mainly authoritative and permissive) with children having high self-esteem, these parenting styles could easily be thought of as having some causal effect in self-esteem development.&lt;ref name="Raboteg 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coopersmith |first=S. |year=1967 |title=The Antecedents of Self-Esteem |location=New York |publisher=W.

During school-aged years, academic achievement is a significant contributor to self-esteem development.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt; A student consistently achieving success or consistently failing will have a strong academic effect on their individual self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crocker |first=J. |last2=Sommers |first2=S.

As children go through school, they begin to understand and recognize differences between themselves and their classmates.

Adolescence shows an increase in self-esteem that continues to increase in young adulthood and middle age.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; A decrease is seen from middle age to old age with varying findings on whether it is a small or large decrease.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; Reasons for the variability could be because of differences in health, cognitive ability, and socioeconomic status in old age.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; No differences have been found between males and females in their development of self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; Multiple cohort studies show that there is not a difference in the life-span trajectory of self-esteem between generations due to societal changes such as grade inflation in education or the presence of [[social media]].&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt;

High levels of mastery, low risk taking, and better health are ways to predict higher self-esteem. In terms of personality, emotionally stable, extroverted, and conscientious individuals experience higher self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; These predictors have shown us that self-esteem has trait-like qualities by remaining stable over time like personality and intelligence.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt;  However, this does not mean it can not be changed.&lt;ref name="Orth 2014" /&gt; Hispanic adolescents have a slightly lower self-esteem than their black and white peers, but then slightly higher levels by age 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Erol |first=R.

Shame can be a contributor to those with problems of low self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ehrenreich|first1=Barbara|title=Patterns for college Writing|date=January 2007|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston|page=680|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feelings of shame usually occur because of a situation where the social self is devalued, such as a socially evaluated poor performance.

===Real self, ideal self, and dreaded self===
There are three levels of self-evaluation development in relation to the real self, ideal self, and the dreaded self. The real, ideal, and dreaded selves develop in children in a sequential pattern on cognitive levels.&lt;ref name="self-evaluation"&gt;{{cite journal |first=F. Clark |last=Power |first2=Vladimir T. |last2=Khmelkov |title=Character development and self-esteem: Psychological foundations and educational implications |journal=International Journal of Educational Research |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=539–551 |doi=10.1016/S0883-0355(97)00053-0 |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Moral Judgment Stages: Individuals describe their Real, Ideal, and Dreaded Selves with stereotypical labels, such as "nice" or "bad". Individuals describe their Ideal and Real Selves in terms of disposition for action or as behavioral habits. The Dreaded Self is often described as being unsuccessful or as having bad habits. 
#Ego Development Stages: Individuals describe their Ideal and Real Selves in terms of traits that are based in attitudes as well as actions. The Dreaded Self is often described as having failed to meet social expectations or as self-centered.
#Self-Understanding Stages: Individuals describe their Ideal and Real Selves as having a unified identity or character. Descriptions of the Dreaded Self focus on a failure to live up to one's ideals or role expectations often because of real world problems. 
This development brings with it increasingly complicated and encompassing moral demands. Level 3 is where individuals' self-esteem can suffer because they do not feel as though they are living up to certain expectations. This feeling will moderately effect one's self-esteem with an even larger effect seen when individuals believe they are becoming their Dreaded Self&lt;ref name="self-evaluation"/&gt;

=== Secure vs. Defensive ===

A person can have a high self-esteem and hold it confidently where they do not need reassurance from others to maintain their positive self view, whereas others with defensive, high self-esteem may still report positive self-evaluations on the Rosenberg Scale, as all high self-esteem individuals do; however, their positive self-views are fragile and vulnerable to criticism. Defensive high self-esteem individuals internalize subconscious self-doubts and insecurities, causing them to react very negatively to any criticism they may receive. There is a need for constant positive feedback from others for these individuals to maintain their feelings of self-worth. The necessity of repeated praise can be associated with boastful, arrogant behavior or sometimes even aggressive and hostile feelings toward anyone who questions the individual's self-worth, an example of threatened egotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jordan |first=C.

=== Implicit, explicit, narcissism and threatened egotism ===

[[Implicit self-esteem]] refers to a person's disposition to evaluate themselves positively or negatively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. It contrasts with [[explicit self-esteem]], which entails more conscious and reflective self-evaluation. Both explicit self-esteem and implicit self-esteem are subtypes of self-esteem proper.

[[Narcissism]] is a disposition people may have that represents an excessive love for one's self. It is characterized by an inflated view of self-worth. Individuals who score high on Narcissism measures, Robert Raskin's ''40 Item True or False Test'', would likely select true to such statements as "If I ruled the world, it would be a much better place."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Krahe, ''The Social Psychology of Aggression'' (Psychology Press, 2013), 75.&lt;/ref&gt; There is only a moderate correlation between narcissism and self-esteem;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sedikieds |first=C. |last2=Rudich |first2=E.

Threatened [[egotism]] is characterized as a response to criticism that threatens the ego of narcissists; they often react in a hostile and aggressive manner.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterSmartBoden1996" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morf |first=C.

=== Low ===

Low self-esteem can result from various factors, including genetic factors, physical appearance or weight, mental health issues, socioeconomic status, significant emotional experiences, [[peer pressure]] or [[bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jones FC |title=Low self esteem |newspaper=Chicago Defender|pages=33|year=2003 |ISSN=0745-7014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person with low self-esteem may show some of the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adapted, Gill J | year = | title = Indispensable Self-Esteem | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 1 | issue = | page = 1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Heavy self-criticism'' and dissatisfaction.&lt;ref name="Bonet" /&gt;
* ''Hypersensitivity to criticism'' with resentment against critics and feelings of being attacked.&lt;ref name="Bonet" /&gt;
* ''Chronic indecision'' and an [[exaggerated]] fear of mistakes.&lt;ref name="Bonet" /&gt;
* ''Excessive will to please'' and unwillingness to displease any petitioner.&lt;ref name="Bonet" /&gt;
* ''[[Perfectionism (psychology)|Perfectionism]]'', which can lead to frustration when perfection is not achieved.&lt;ref name="Bonet" /&gt;

* ''[[Envy]]'', invidiousness, or general resentment.&lt;ref name="Bonet" /&gt;
* Sees temporary setbacks as permanent, intolerable conditions.&lt;ref name="KidsHealth" /&gt;

Individuals with low self-esteem tend to be critical of themselves. Some depend on the approval and praise of others when evaluating self-worth. Others may measure their likability in terms of successes: others will accept themselves if they succeed but will not if they fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baldwin |first=M.

=== The three states ===
This classification proposed by Martin Ross&lt;ref name="Ross, Martín 2013"&gt;Ross, Martín. El Mapa de la Autoestima. 2013. Dunken. {{ISBN|978-987-02-6773-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes three states of self-esteem compared to the "feats" ([[wikt:triumph|triumph]]s, [[honor]]s, [[virtue]]s) and the "anti-feats" ([[wikt:defeat|defeat]]s, [[embarrassment]], [[shame]], etc.) of the individuals.&lt;ref name="ecuador"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Autoestima género"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monografias.com/trabajos104/como-influye-genero-autoestima-adolescentes/como-influye-genero-autoestima-adolescentes.shtml|title=Como influye el genero en la Autoestima de los Adolescentes - Monografias.com|first=Darcy Leiva,|last=Monografias.com|website=Monografias.com|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shattered ====
The individual does not regard themselves as valuable or lovable. They may be overwhelmed by defeat, or shame, or see themselves as such, and they name their "anti-feat". For example, if they consider that being over a certain age is an anti-feat, they define themselves with the name of their anti-feat, and say, "I am old". They express actions and feelings such as pity, insulting themselves, and they may become paralyzed by their sadness.&lt;ref name="Ross, Martín 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digital activity"&gt;“Feedback between self-esteem and digital activity in the adolescent group.” Bonet Gallardo, L. Huertas Bailén, Amparo. Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona. 2015 Online at http://ddd.uab.cat/record/142342?ln=en&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vulnerable ====
The individual has a generally positive self-image. However, their self-esteem is also vulnerable to the perceived risk of an imminent anti-feat (such as defeat, embarrassment, shame, discredit), consequently they are often nervous and regularly use defense mechanisms.&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt; A typical protection mechanism of those with a Vulnerable Self-Esteem may consist in avoiding decision-making.  Although such individuals may outwardly exhibit great self-confidence, the underlying reality may be just the opposite: the apparent [[self-confidence]] is indicative of their heightened fear of anti-feats and the fragility of their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="ecuador"/&gt; They may also try to blame others to protect their self-image from situations which would threaten it. They may employ defense mechanisms, including attempting to lose at games and other competitions in order to protect their self-image by publicly dissociating themselves from a 'need to win', and asserting an independence from social acceptance which they may deeply desire. In this deep fear of being unaccepted by an individual's peers, they make poor life choices by making risky choices.&lt;ref name="Autoestima género"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt;

==== Strong ====
People with strong self-esteem have a positive [[self-image]] and enough strength so that anti-feats do not subdue their self-esteem. They have less fear of failure. These individuals appear humble, cheerful, and this shows a certain strength not to boast about feats and not to be afraid of anti-feats.&lt;ref name="Autoestima género"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt;
They are capable of fighting with all their might to achieve their goals because, if things go wrong, their self-esteem will not be affected.  They can acknowledge their own mistakes precisely because their self-image is strong, and this acknowledgment will not impair or affect their self-image.&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt; They live with less fear of losing social prestige, and with more happiness and general well-being.&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt;
However, no type of self-esteem is indestructible,{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} and due to certain situations or circumstances in life, one can fall from this level into any other state of self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Ross, Martín 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digital activity"/&gt;

=== Contingent vs. non-contingent ===
A distinction is made between contingent (or conditional&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/contingent|title=Contingent Synonyms, Contingent Antonyms - Thesaurus.com|website=thesaurus.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  and non-contingent (or unconditional&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/unconditional|title=Unconditional|accessdate=11 December 2017|publisher=[[The Free Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) self-esteem.

'''Contingent self-esteem''' is derived from external sources, such as (a) what others say, (b) one's success or failure, (c) one's competence,&lt;ref name="Koivula-et-al-2002"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Koivula | first = Nathalie  | last2 = Hassmén | first2 = Peter  | last3 = Fallby | first3 = Johan  | title = Self-esteem and perfectionism in elite athletes: effects on competitive anxiety and self-confidence  | journal = Personality and Individual Differences  | volume = 32 | issue = 5  | year = 2002  | pages = 865–875  | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(01)00092-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or (d) [[relationship-contingent self-esteem]].

Therefore, contingent self-esteem is marked by instability, unreliability, and vulnerability. Persons lacking a non-contingent self-esteem are "predisposed to an incessant pursuit of self-value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Victoria Blom|title="Striving for Self-esteem" (Department of Psychology, Stockholm University, 2011)|page=17|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:406035/FULLTEXT01.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the pursuit of contingent self-esteem is based on receiving approval, it is doomed to fail. No one receives constant approval and disapproval often evokes depression. Furthermore, fear of disapproval inhibits activities in which failure is possible.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201112/the-boom-and-bust-ego|title=The Boom and Bust Ego|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the Pauline-Lutheran doctrine of 'justification by faith.'" [[Paul Tillich]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich, ''Terry Lectures: Courage to Be'' (Yale University, 2000) 164.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
'''Non-contingent self-esteem''' is described as true, stable, and solid.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Mruk, ''Self-esteem Research, Theory, and Practice'' (Springer, 1995), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; It springs from a belief that one is "acceptable period, acceptable before life itself, ontologically acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;Terry D. Cooper, ''Paul Tillich and Psychology: Historic and Contemporary Explorations in Theology, Psychotherapy, and Ethics'' (Mercer University,2006). 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Belief that one is "ontologically acceptable" is to believe that one's acceptability is "the way things ''be'' without contingency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahpcc.org.uk/includes/articles/selfesteem.pdf|format=PDF|title=Self-esteem/OKness: a personal story|website=Ahpcc.org.uk|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this belief, as expounded by theologian [[Paul Tillich]], acceptability is not based on a person's virtue. It is an acceptance given "''in spite of our guilt'', not because we ''have no guilt''".&lt;ref&gt;Terry D. Cooper, ''Paul Tillich and Psychology: Historic and Contemporary Explorations in Theology, Psychotherapy, and Ethics'' (Mercer University,2006). 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Thomas A Harris]] drew on theologian Paul Tillich for his classic [[I'm OK, You're OK|''I'm OK – You're OK'']] that addresses non-contingent self-esteem. Harris translated Tillich's "acceptable" by the vernacular "OK", a term that means "acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/OK|title=OK|accessdate=11 December 2017|publisher=[[The Free Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian message, said Harris, is not "YOU CAN BE OK, IF", It is "YOU ARE ACCEPTED, unconditionally".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Harris, ''I'm OK — You're OK'' (Harper and Row), 1969, 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

A secure non-contingent self-esteem springs from the belief that one is ontologically acceptable and accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/jackbauer/PGSG/Kernis%2003%20opt%20s-esteem%20authenticity%20copy.pdf|format=PDF|title=Toward a Conceptualization of Optimal Self-Esteem|author=Michael H.

==Importance==
[[Abraham Maslow]] states that psychological health is not possible unless the essential core of the person is fundamentally accepted, loved and respected by others and by her or his self. Self-esteem allows people to face life with more confidence, benevolence and optimism, and thus easily reach their goals and self-actualize.&lt;ref name="Branden"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=psvHFOqRuhkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Nathaniel Branden. ''Cómo mejorar su autoestima'']. 1987. Versión traducida: 1990. 1ª edición en formato electrónico: enero de 2010. Ediciones Paidós Ibérica. {{ISBN|978-84-493-2347-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-esteem may make people convinced they deserve happiness.&lt;ref name="Branden" /&gt; Understanding this is fundamental, and universally beneficial, since the development of positive self-esteem increases the capacity to treat other people with respect, benevolence and goodwill, thus favoring rich interpersonal relationships and avoiding destructive ones.&lt;ref name="Branden" /&gt; For [[Erich Fromm]], love of others and love of ourselves are not alternatives. On the contrary, an attitude of love toward themselves will be found in all those who are capable of loving others. Self-esteem allows creativity at the workplace, and is a specially critical condition for [[teaching]] professions.&lt;ref name="Miranda"&gt;Christian Miranda.

José-Vicente Bonet claims that the importance of self-esteem is obvious as a lack of self-esteem is, he says, not a loss of esteem from others, but self-rejection. Bonet claims that this corresponds to [[Major depressive disorder]].&lt;ref name="Bonet" /&gt; [[Freud]] also claimed that the depressive has suffered "an extraordinary diminution in his self-regard, an impoverishment of his ego on a grand scale....He has lost his self-respect".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 254-6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], a document on [[international human rights law]] addresses the discriminatory attitude toward [[LGBT]] peoples that makes their self-esteem low to be subject to human rights violation including [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], Preamble and Principles 11&lt;/ref&gt; and [[World Health Organization]] recommends in "Preventing Suicide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=World Health Organization|title=Preventing suicide: A global imperative|journal=World Health Organization - Mental Health|date=2014|pages=92|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/world_report_2014/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;" published in 2000 that strengthening students' self-esteem is important to protect children and adolescents against mental distress and despondency, enabling them to cope adequately with difficult and stressful life situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_hearth/media/en/62.pdf|title=Preventing Suicide, A resource for teachers and other school staff, WHO, Geneva, 2000|website=who.int|accessdate=22 October 2017}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; How this might be done, and whether it would be effective is unclear.

Other than increased happiness, higher self-esteem is also known to be correlated with a better ability to cope with stress and a higher likeliness that the individual takes on difficult tasks relative to those with low self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel L. |first2=Daniel T. |last2=Gilbert |first3=Daniel M. |last3=Wegner |chapter=Self Esteem |title=Psychology |location=New York |publisher=Worth |year=2009 |edition=Second |isbn=978-0-7167-5215-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Correlates ===

From the late 1970s to the early 1990s many Americans assumed as a matter of course that students' self-esteem acted as a critical factor in the grades that they earn in school, in their [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] with their peers, and in their later success in life. Under this assumption, some American groups created programs which aimed to increase the self-esteem of students. Until the 1990s little peer-reviewed and controlled research took place on this topic.

Peer-reviewed research undertaken since then has not validated previous assumptions. Recent research indicates that inflating students' self-esteem in and of itself has no positive effect on grades. [[Roy Baumeister]] has shown that inflating self-esteem by itself can actually decrease grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumeister|first=Roy F.|author2=Jennifer D. Campbell, Joachim I.

It simply means that high self-esteem may be accomplished as a result of high academic performance due to the other variables of social interactions and life events affecting this performance.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baumeister|first1=R.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Attempts by pro-esteem advocates to encourage self-pride in students solely by reason of their uniqueness as human beings will fail if feelings of well-being are not accompanied by well-doing. It is only when students engage in personally meaningful endeavors for which they can be justifiably proud that self-confidence grows, and it is this growing self-assurance that in turn triggers further achievement."&lt;ref&gt;Reasoner, Robert W.

High self-esteem has a high correlation to self-reported happiness; whether this is a causal relationship has not been established.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt; The relationship between self-esteem and [[life satisfaction]] is stronger in individualistic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.erin.utoronto.ca/~w3psyuli/PReprints/JRP_IESE_SWB.pdf | title=Predictive validity of explicit and implicit self-esteem for subjective well-being | author=Ulrich Schimmack and Ed Diener | journal=Journal of Research in Personality | year=2003 | volume=37 | issue=2 | pages=100–106 | doi=10.1016/S0092-6566(02)00532-9}}&lt;!--page 101 mentions two studies that demonstrate this--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, self-esteem has been found to be related to forgiveness in close relationships, in that people with high self-esteem will be more forgiving than people with low self-esteem.&lt;ref name="EatonWardstruthers2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eaton|first1=J|last2=Wardstruthers|first2=C|last3=Santelli|first3=A|title=Dispositional and state forgiveness: The role of self-esteem, need for structure, and narcissism|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=41|issue=2|year=2006|pages=371–380|issn=0191-8869|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High self-esteem does not prevent children from smoking, drinking, taking drugs, or engaging in early sex.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt; One important exception is that high self-esteem reduces the chances of bulimia in females.&lt;ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /&gt;

== Neuroscience ==
In a 2014 research conducted by Robert S. Chavez and Todd F. Heatherton, it was found that self-esteem is related to the connectivity of the [[frontostriatal circuit]]. The frontostriatal pathway connects the [[medial prefrontal cortex]], which deals with [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], to the [[ventral striatum]], which deals with feelings of [[motivation]] and [[Reward system|reward]]. Stronger anatomical pathways are correlated with higher long-term self-esteem, while stronger functional connectivity is correlated with higher short-term self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/15/scan.nsu063.abstract?sid=47d08b42-0aa2-4f71-a058-1b2e69810145 | title=Multimodal frontostriatal connectivity underlies individual differences in self-esteem | publisher=''Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience''.

== Criticism and controversy ==

The American psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] criticized on numerous occasions the concept of self-esteem as essentially self-defeating and ultimately destructive.&lt;ref name="Ellis, A. 2001"&gt;Ellis, A. (2001). Feeling better, getting better, staying better. Impact Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; Although acknowledging the human propensity and tendency to ego rating as innate, he has critiqued the philosophy of self-esteem as unrealistic, illogical and self- and socially destructive – often doing more harm than good. Questioning the foundations and usefulness of generalized ego strength, he has claimed that self-esteem is based on arbitrary definitional [[premise]]s, and over-generalized, perfectionistic and grandiose thinking.&lt;ref name="Ellis, A. 2001" /&gt; Acknowledging that rating and valuing behaviours and characteristics is functional and even necessary, he sees rating and valuing human beings' totality and total selves as irrational and unethical. The healthier alternative to self-esteem according to him is unconditional [[self-acceptance]] and unconditional other-[[acceptance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=A. |title=The Myth of Self-esteem |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2005 |isbn=1-59102-354-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]]'' is a psychotherapy based on this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPeFALg673MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Practice of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy: Second Edition|first1=Albert Ellis|last1=PhD|first2=Windy Dryden|last2=PhD|date=31 July 2007|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|accessdate=11 December 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

: "There seem to be only two clearly demonstrated benefits of high self-esteem....First, it increases initiative, probably because it lends confidence. People with high self-esteem are more willing to act on their beliefs, to stand up for what they believe in, to approach others, to risk new undertakings. (This unfortunately includes being extra willing to do stupid or destructive things, even when everyone else advises against them.)...It can also lead people to ignore sensible advice as they stubbornly keep wasting time and money on hopeless causes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baumeister |last2=Tierney |year=2011 |title=Willpower: The Greatest's Human Strength |location= |publisher= |page=192 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== False attempts ===
For persons with low self-esteem, any positive stimulus will temporarily raise self-esteem. Therefore, possessions, sex, success, or physical appearance will produce development of self-esteem, but the development is ephemeral at best.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Branden, ''The Six Pillars of Self-esteem'' (Bantam, 1995), 52. Also see Nathaniel Branden, ''How to Raise Your Self-Esteem: The Proven Action-Oriented Approach to Greater Self-Respect and Self-Confidence'' (Random House, 1988), 9. Spanish edition: ''Cómo mejorar su autoestima'' (Paidos, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Such attempts to raise one's self-esteem by positive stimulus produce a "boom or bust" pattern. "Compliments and positive feedback" produce a boost, but a bust follows a lack of such feedback. For a person whose "self-esteem is contingent", success is "not extra sweet", but "failure is extra bitter".&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

=== As narcissism ===

Life satisfaction, happiness, healthy behavioral practices, [[Self-efficacy|perceived efficacy]], and academic success and adjustment have been associated with having high levels of self-esteem (Harter, 1987; Huebner, 1991; Lipschitz-Elhawi &amp; Itzhaky, 2005; Rumberger 1995; Swenson &amp; Prelow, 2005; Yarcheski &amp; Mahon, 1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Michaels |first=M. |last2=Barr |first2=A. |last3=Roosa |first3=M. |last4=Knight |first4=G. |year=2007 |title=Self-Esteem: Assessing Measurement Equivalence in a Multiethnic Sample of Youth |journal=Journal of Early Adolescence |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=269–295 |doi=10.1177/0272431607302009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|270}} However, a common mistake is to think that [[self-love|loving oneself]] is necessarily equivalent to narcissism, as opposed for example to what [[Erik Erikson]] speaks of as "a post-narcissistic love of the ego".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Erik H. |last=Erikson |title=[[Childhood and Society]] |location=Harmondsworth |publisher=Penguin |year=1973 |page=260 |isbn=0-14-020754-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person with a healthy self-esteem accepts and loves himself/herself unconditionally, acknowledging both virtues and faults in the self, and yet, in spite of everything, is able to continue to love her/himself.

In narcissists, by contrast, an " uncertainty about their own worth gives rise to...a self-protective, but often totally spurious, aura of [[grandiosity]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Crompton |title=All about Me |location=London |publisher=Collins |year=2007 |page=16 |isbn=978-0-00-724795-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– producing the class "of narcissists, or people with very high, but insecure, self-esteem... fluctuating with each new episode of social praise or rejection."&lt;ref name="SmithMackie" /&gt;{{rp|479}} Narcissism can thus be seen as a symptom of fundamentally low self-esteem, that is, lack of love towards oneself, but often accompanied by "an immense increase in self-esteem" based on "the [[defense mechanism]] of denial by overcompensation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Otto |last=Fenichel |title=The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis |location=London |publisher= |year=1946 |pages=407–410 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
"idealized love of self...rejected the part of him" that he denigrates&amp;nbsp;– "this destructive little child"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Neville |last=Symington |title=Narcissism: A New Theory |location=London |publisher=Karmac |year=2003 |page=114 |isbn=1-85575-047-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; within. Instead, the narcissist emphasizes his virtues in the presence of others, just to try to convince himself that he is a valuable person and to try to stop feeling ashamed for his faults;&lt;ref name="Bonet" /&gt; unfortunately such "people with unrealistically inflated self-views, which may be especially unstable and highly vulnerable to negative information,...tend to have poor social skills."&lt;ref name="SmithMackie" /&gt;{{rp|126}}

[[File:Sign-of-the-cross--fingers-position.jpg|thumb|upright|Position of the fingers while making the sign of the cross in the Byzantine fashion]] 
The '''sign of the cross''' ({{lang-la|signum crucis}}), or '''blessing oneself''' or '''crossing oneself''', is a ritual blessing made by members of most branches of [[Christianity]]. This blessing is made by the tracing of an upright cross or '''+''' across the body with the right hand, often accompanied by spoken or mental recitation of the [[trinitarian formula]]: "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coptic.net/prayers/agpeya/Veil.html|title=The Prayer of the Veil|year=2011|publisher=Encyclopedia Coptica|language=English|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement is the tracing of the shape of a cross in the air or on one's own body, echoing the traditional shape of the [[Christian cross|cross]] of the [[Christian]] [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion narrative]]. There are two principal forms: one&amp;mdash;three fingers, right to left&amp;mdash;is exclusively used in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Church of the East]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] in the Byzantine, Assyrian and Chaldean traditions; the other&amp;mdash;left to right to middle, other than three fingers&amp;mdash;is the one used in the [[Latin Church|Latin (Catholic) Church]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Methodism]], [[Presbyterianism]], [[Lutheranism]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]. The ritual is rare within [[Christian denomination|other Christian traditions]].

Many individuals use the expression "cross my heart and hope to die" as an [[oath]], making the sign of the cross, in order to show "truthfulness and sincerity", sworn before God, in both personal and legal situations.&lt;ref name="Ayto2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayto|first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of English Idioms|date=8 July 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English |isbn=9780199543786|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Christian cross|Cross]] is a symbol representing Christ’s victory over sin and death.&lt;ref name=serafim/&gt; The sign of the cross was originally made in some parts of the Christian world with the right-hand thumb across the forehead only.&lt;ref name="Thurston"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13785a.htm Thurston, Herbert. "Sign of the Cross." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13.

"Archæology of the Cross and Crucifix." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 20 Jan. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Vestiges of this early variant of the practice remain: in the [[Roman Rite]] of the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] in the [[Catholic Church]], the faithful make this gesture on the forehead, on the lips, and on the heart at the proclamation of the Gospel;&lt;ref name="Thurston" /&gt; on [[Ash Wednesday]] a cross is traced in ashes on the forehead; holy oil (called [[chrism]]) is applied on the forehead for the [[sacrament]] of [[Confirmation]] (called the [[Sacred mysteries#Eastern Christianity|Holy Mystery]] of [[Chrismation]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], as Orthodox call the Sacraments by the name "Holy Mystery"). By the 4th century, the sign of the cross involved other parts of the body beyond the forehead.&lt;ref name="Thurston" /&gt;

The open right hand is used in [[Western Christianity]]. The five open fingers are often said to represent the [[Five Wounds of Christ]].&lt;ref name=Beale/&gt; This symbolism was adopted after the more ancient gesture of two or three fingers was simplified. Though this is the most common method of crossing by Western Christians, other forms are sometimes used. The West also employs the "Small Sign of the Cross" (+).  The primary use  for this is immediately before the reading of The [[Gospel]] during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Using the right thumb, a small cross is traced over the forehead, lips, and heart of the individual while whispering or silently praying the words  "May Christ's words be on my mind, on my lips, and in my heart."  The Small Sign is also used during the majority of the [[Sacraments]].

In the Roman or [[Latin Rite]] Church it is customary to make the full Sign of the Cross using [[holy water]] when entering a church. The first three fingers of the right hand are dipped into the [[Baptismal font|font]] containing the [[holy water]] and the Sign of the Cross is made on oneself. This gesture has a two-fold purpose:  to remind one of their [[baptism]] and the rights and responsibilities that go with it  and to also remind one that they are entering a [[sacred]] place that is set apart from the world outside.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] (including the [[Russian Orthodox]]) and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the tips of the first three fingers (the thumb, index, and middle ones) are brought together, and the last two (the "ring" and little fingers) are pressed against the palm. The first three fingers express one's faith in the Trinity, while the remaining two fingers represent the two natures of Jesus, divine and human.&lt;ref name=serafim&gt;[http://www.russianorthodox-stl.org/sign_of_cross.html Slobodskoy, Serafim Alexivich. "The Sign of the Cross", St. John Chrysostom Orthodox Church, House Springs, Missouri]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Russia]], until the reforms of [[Patriarch Nikon]] in the 17th century, it was customary to make the sign of the cross with two fingers (symbolising the dual nature of Christ).  The enforcement of the three-finger sign was one of the reasons for the [[Schism (religion)|schism]] with the [[Old Believers]] whose congregations continue to use the two-finger sign of the cross.

The [[Oriental Orthodox]] (Armenians, Copts, Ethiopians etc.) generally use the "Western" direction as well, though often with the Byzantine finger formation.

=== Motion ===
The sign of the cross is made by touching the hand sequentially to the forehead, lower chest or stomach, and both shoulders, accompanied by the [[Trinitarian formula]]: at the forehead ''In the name of the Father'' (or ''In nomine Patris'' in Latin); at the stomach or heart ''and of the Son'' (''et Filii''); across the shoulders ''and of the [[Holy Spirit]]/Ghost'' (''et Spiritus Sancti''); and finally: ''[[Amen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, John F., ''The Externals of the Catholic Church'', P.J. Kenedy &amp; Sons (1918)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several interpretations, according to [[Church Fathers]]:&lt;ref name="prayer-book-bor"&gt;''Prayer Book'', edited by the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], several editions (''Carte de rugăciuni'' - Editura Institutului biblic şi de misiune al Bisericii ortodoxe române, 2005),&lt;/ref&gt; the forehead symbolizes Heaven; the solar plexus (or top of stomach), the earth; the shoulders, the place and sign of power. It also recalls both the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation]]. [[Pope Innocent III]] (1198–1216) explained: "The sign of the cross is made with three fingers, because the signing is done together with the invocation of the Trinity. ... This is how it is done: from above to below, and from the right to the left, because Christ descended from the heavens to the earth..."&lt;ref name=Beale&gt;[http://catholicexchange.com/21-things-cross Beale, Stephen. "21 Things We Do When We Make the Sign of the Cross", Catholic Exchange, November 11, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Innocent&gt;"Est autem signum crucis tribus digitis exprimendum, quia sub invocatione Trinitatis imprimitur, de qua dicit propheta: Quis appendit tribus digitis molem terrae? (Isa. XL.) ita quod a superiori descendat in inferius, et a dextra transeat ad sinistram, quia Christus de coelo descendit in terram, et a Judaeis transivit ad gentes. Quidam tamen signum crucis a sinistra producunt in dextram; quia de miseria transire debemus ad gloriam, sicut et Christus transivit de morte ad vitam, et de inferno ad paradisum, praesertim ut seipsos et alios uno eodemque pariter modo consignent. Constat autem quod cum super alios signum crucis imprimimus, ipsos a sinistris consignamus in dextram. Verum si diligenter attendas, etiam super alios signum crucis a dextra producimus in sinistram, quia non consignamus eos quasi vertentes dorsum, sed quasi faciem praesentantes." (Innocentius III, De sacro altaris mysterio, II, xlv in Patrologia Latina 217, 825C--D.)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some variations: for example a person may first place the right hand in [[holy water]]. After moving the hand from one shoulder to the other, it may be returned to the top of the stomach. It may also be accompanied by the recitation of a prayer (e.g., the [[Jesus Prayer]], or simply "[[Kyrie|Lord have mercy]]"). In some catholic countries, like [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Brazil]] and other Latin countries, it is customary to kiss one's thumb at the conclusion of the gesture,&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Ann Kasten, ''Linking Your Beads: The Rosary's History, Mysteries, and Prayers'', Our Sunday Visitor 2011, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; while in the [[Philippines]], this extra step evolved into the thumb quickly touching the chin or lower lip.

Ending the sign of the cross, usually and in the tradition, people make the right open hand upon the other (the left open hand), with all the five fingers, like in a prayer, till the height of the face.

Also there is a full [[genuflection]], with the right knee totally given down to the level of the earth, and directly in front of the [[Blessed Sacrament]], which for the Catholic Church is the physical presence of Jesus Christ God and the Holy Spirit.

Some people use the humorous mnemonic device "spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch" to remember the sequence of motions, although this is frowned upon by some.

=== Sequence ===

[[Theodoret]] (393–457) gave the following instruction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is how to bless someone with your hand and make the sign of the cross over them. Hold three fingers, as equals, together, to represent the Trinity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost. These are not three gods, but one God in Trinity. The names are separate, but the divinity one. The Father was never incarnate; the Son incarnate, but not created; the Holy Ghost neither incarnate nor created, but issued from the Godhead: three in a single divinity. Divinity is one force and has one honor. They receive on obeisance from all creation, both angels and people. Thus the decree for these three fingers.

You should hold the other two fingers slightly bent, not completely straight. This is because these represent the dual nature of Christ, divine and human. God in His divinity, and human in His incarnation, yet perfect in both. The upper finger represents divinity, and the lower humanity; this way salvation goes from the higher finger to the lower. So is the bending of the fingers interpreted, for the worship of Heaven comes down for our salvation. This is how you must cross yourselves and give a blessing, as the holy fathers have commanded.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peter of Damascus (12th century) gave the following instruction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then we should also marvel how demons and various diseases are dispelled by the sign of the precious and life-giving Cross, which all can make without cost or effort. Who can number the panegyrics composed in its honor? The holy fathers have handed down to us the inner significance of this sign, so that we can refute heretics and unbelievers. The two fingers and single hand with which it is made represent the Lord Jesus Christ crucified, and He is thereby acknowledged to exist in two natures and one hypostasis or person.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The use of the right hand betokens His infinite power and the fact that He sits at the right hand of the Father. That the sign begins with a downward movement from above signifies His descent to us from heaven. Again, the movement of the hand from the right side to the left drives away our enemies and declares that by His invincible power the Lord overcame the devil, who is on the left side, dark and lacking strength.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Athanasius of Alexandria]] (269–373 A.D.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
By the signing of the holy and life-giving cross, devils and various scourges are driven away. For it is without price and without cost and praises him who can say it. The holy fathers have, by their words, transmitted to us, and even to the unbelieving heretics, how the two raised fingers and the single hand reveal Christ our God in His dual nature but single substance. The right hand proclaims His immeasurable strength, His sitting on the right hand of the Father, and His coming down unto us from Heaven. Again, by the movement of the hands to our right the enemies of God will be driven out, as the Lord triumphs over the Devil with His inconquerable power, rendering him dismal and weak.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian [[Herbert Thurston]] interprets this as indicating that at one time both Eastern and Western Christians moved the hand from the right shoulder to the left, although the point is not entirely clear. German theologian, Valentin Thalhofer, thought writings quoted in support of this, such as that of Innocent III, refer to the small cross made upon the forehead or external objects, in which the hand moves naturally from right to left, and not the big cross made from shoulder to shoulder.&lt;ref name=Thurston/&gt; Andreas Andreopoulos, author of ''The Sign of the Cross'', gives a more detailed description of the development and the symbolism of the placement of the fingers and the direction of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Andreopoulos, ''The Sign of the Cross'', Paraclete Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-55725-496-2}}, pp. 11-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Western Christians and the Oriental Orthodox touch the left shoulder before the right. Eastern Catholics and Orthodox Christians use the right-to-left movement.

The proper sequence of tracing the sign of the cross is taught to converts from Christian denominations that are either nontrinitarian or not using the gesture and non-Christian religions.

==Use==
The sign of the cross may be made by individuals upon themselves as a form of [[Prayer in Christianity|prayer]] and by clergy upon others or objects as an act of [[blessing]]. The gesture of blessing is certainly related to the sign of the cross, but the two gestures developed independently after some point. In [[Eastern Christianity]], the two gestures differ significantly. [[Priest]]s and deacons are allowed to bless using the right hand, while [[bishop]]s may bless simultaneously with both, the left mirroring the right. While individuals may make it at any time, clergy must make it at specific times (as in [[Christian liturgy|liturgies]]), and it is customary to make it on other occasions.

Although the sign of the cross dates to ante-Nicene Christianity, it was rejected by some of the Reformers and is absent from some forms of [[Protestantism]], although some other reformed Christian traditions, such as [[Anglicanism]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Presbyterianism]], and [[Methodism]] sometimes use it. However, it has often been rejected by some [[Non-Conformist]] Protestants as being a [[high church]] practice, despite Martin Luther's positive personal view. The prescribed use of the sign in ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' and the defence of the sign of the cross were established in Anglican canon law in 1604.

Some Christians make the sign of the cross in response to perceived blasphemy. Others sign themselves to seek God's blessing before or during an event with uncertain outcome. In [[Hispanidad|Hispanic countries]], people often sign themselves in public, such as athletes who cross themselves before entering the field or while concentrating for competition.

===Catholicism===
The sign of the cross is a [[Roman Catholic prayer|prayer]], a [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|blessing]], and a [[Sacramentals|sacramental]]. As a sacramental, it prepares an individual to receive grace and disposes one to cooperate with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c4a1.htm  "Sacramentals", ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', §1670]&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian begins his day, his prayers, and his activities with the Sign of the Cross: "In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen." In this way, a person dedicates the day to God and calls on him for strength in temptations and difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a2.htm CCC §2157]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Vianney]] said a genuinely made Sign of the Cross "makes all hell tremble."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicdigest.com/articles/faith/praying/2010/08-24/making-the-sign-of-the-cross Emmons, D. D., "Making the Sign of the Cross", ''Catholic Digest''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813153520/http://www.catholicdigest.com/articles/faith/praying/2010/08-24/making-the-sign-of-the-cross |date=2016-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, a longer version is commonly said while making the sign of the cross in the forehead, the mouth and the chest: "By the sign of the cross deliver us from our enemies, you who are our God. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen." After the "you who are our God" part is recited, the ritual then proceeds with the normal Catholic sign of the cross as explained above.

====Liturgical====
Roman Catholicism draws a distinction between liturgical and non-liturgical use of the sign of the cross. The sign of the cross is required at certain points of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]: the laity sign themselves during the introductory greeting of the service, before the Gospel reading (small signs on forehead, lips, and heart), and at the final blessing; optionally, other times during the Mass when the laity often cross themselves are during a blessing with holy water, when concluding the penitential rite, immediately after receiving Communion, and when concluding private prayer after Communion. In the [[Mass of Paul VI|ordinary form of the Roman Rite]] the priest signs bread and wine once before the consecration. In the [[Tridentine Mass]] the priest signs the bread and wine 25 times during the [[Canon of the Mass]], ten times before and fifteen times after they have been consecrated. The priest also uses the sign of the cross when blessing a deacon before the deacon reads the Gospel, when sending an Extraordinary Minister of Holy Communion to take the Eucharist to the sick (after Communion, but before the end of the Mass), and when blessing the congregation at the conclusion of the Mass.

Ordained bishops, priests and deacons have more empowerment to bless objects and other people. While lay people may preside at certain blessings, the more a blessing is concerned with ecclesial or sacramental matters, the more it is reserved to clergy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c4a1.htm  CCC, §1669]&lt;/ref&gt; Extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion do not ordinarily have a commission to bless in the name of the Church, as priests and deacons do. At this point in the liturgy, their specific function is to assist the clergy in the distribution of holy Communion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/zlitur81.htm McNamara, Edward, "Blessings for Non-Communicants", ''Zenit'', 10 May 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Extraordinary Ministers of Communion, blessing those who do not wish to or cannot receive communion can speak or raise the hand but not make the sign of the cross over the person.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235846/http://www.archatl.com/offices/chancellor/training/pdfs/2011-2012/2012-EMHC-manual-english.pdf ''Archdiocesan  Manual for Parish Trainers of Extraordinary Ministers of Communion'', Archdiocese of Atlanta]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-liturgical====
A priest or deacon blesses an object or person with a single sign of the cross, but a bishop blesses with a triple sign of the cross. In the Catholic organization the [[Legion of Mary]], members doing door-to-door parish surveys bless the homes of those not home by tracing the sign of the cross on the door.&lt;ref&gt;Legion of Mary Handbook&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
[[File:Christus Ravenna Mosaic.jpg|thumb|160px|right|''[[Christ Pantokrator]]'' mosaic, [[Ravenna]], 6th century: Jesus' hand is shown lifted in blessing in the position used by Orthodox priests (evoking the abbreviation of his name in Greek, "IC XC").]]
In the Eastern traditions, both celebrant and congregation make the sign of the cross quite frequently. It is customary in some Eastern traditions to cross oneself at each petition in a [[Ektenia|litany]] and to closely associate oneself with a particular intention being prayed for or with a saint being named. The sign of the cross is also made upon entering or leaving a church building, at the start and end of personal prayer, when passing the main altar (which represents Christ), whenever all three persons of the Trinity are addressed, and when approaching an icon.

When an [[Eastern Orthodox]] or [[Eastern Catholic]] bishop or priest blesses with the sign of the cross, he holds the fingers of his right hand in such a way that they form the Greek abbreviation for Jesus Christ "[[IC XC]]". The index finger is extended to make the "I"; the middle finger signify letter "C"; the thumb touches the lowered third finger to signify the "X" and the little finger also signifies the letter "C".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintelias.com/ca/etiquette/sign.php "The Sign of the Cross", St. Elias the Prophet Church, Eparchy of Toronto and Eastern Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; When a priest blesses in the sign of the cross, he positions the fingers of his right hand in the manner described as he raises his right hand, then moves his hand downwards, then to his left, then to his right. A bishop blesses with both hands (unless he is holding some sacred object such as a cross, [[chalice (cup)|chalice]], [[Gospel Book]], [[icon]], etc.), holding the fingers of both hands in the same configuration, but when he moves his right hand to the left, he simultaneously moves his left hand to the right, so that the two hands cross, the left in front of the right, and then the right in front of the left. The blessing of both priests and bishops consists of three movements, in honour of the [[Holy Trinity]].

===Lutheranism===
Among Lutherans the practice was widely retained. For example, [[Luther's Small Catechism]] states that it is expected before the morning and evening prayers. Lutheranism never abandoned the practice of making the sign of the cross in principle and it was commonly retained in worship at least until the early 19th century. During the 19th and early 20th centuries it was largely in disuse until the liturgical renewal movement of the 1950s and 1960s. One exception is ''[[The Lutheran Hymnal]]'' (1941) of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS), which states that "The sign of the cross may be made at the Trinitarian Invocation and at the words of the Nicene Creed 'and the life of the world to come.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Lutheran Hymnal'', 1941. Concordia Publishing House: St. Louis, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the sign of the cross has become fairly commonplace among Lutherans at worship. The sign of the cross is now customary in the [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]].&lt;ref name="ELCA"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Worship.aspx| title = Why Do Lutherans Make the Sign of the Cross?|publisher = Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|accessdate = 2007-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LCMS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=3941 |title=Sign of the Cross |publisher=Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050920095725/http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=3941 |archivedate=September 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubrics in contemporary Lutheran worship manuals, including ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'' of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] and ''[[Lutheran Service Book]]'' used by LCMS and [[Lutheran Church–Canada]], provide for making the sign of the cross at certain points in the liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;''Evangelical Lutheran Worship''. Minneapolis:Augsburg Fortress, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lutheran Service Book''. St. Louis: Concordia, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Most places are the same as the Roman Catholic practice, such as at the [[trinitarian formula]], the [[benediction]], at the consecration of the Eucharist, and following reciting the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] or [[Apostles' Creed]].

Devotional use of the sign of the cross among Lutherans also includes after receiving the Host and Chalice in the Eucharist, following [[Holy Absolution]]; similarly, they may dip their hands in the [[baptismal font]] and make the sign of the cross upon entering the church.

===Methodism===
The sign of the cross is in the [[Methodist]] liturgy, primarily in the Methodist/ Episcopal not necessarily in the UMC. And  this is made by some clergy during the ''[[Anaphora (liturgy)|Great Thanksgiving]]'', ''[[Confession (religion)#Methodism|Confession of Sin and Pardon]]'', and ''[[benediction]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revneal.org/Writings/preparedandcrosschecked.html|title=Prepared and Cross-Checked|last=Neal|first=Gregory S.|year=2011|publisher=Grace Incarnate Ministries|language=English|accessdate=18 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420055301/http://www.revneal.org/Writings/preparedandcrosschecked.html|archivedate=20 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UMC 1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=16&amp;mid=1432| title = Can United Methodists use the sign of the cross?|publisher = United Methodist Church|accessdate = 2007-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wesley]], the principal leader of the early Methodists, prepared a revision of ''The Book of Common Prayer'' for Methodist use called ''The Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America'' which does instruct the minister to make the sign of the cross on the forehead of children just after they have been baptized.&lt;ref&gt;John Wesley's Prayer Book: The Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America with introduction, notes, and commentary by James F. White, 1991 OSL Publications, Akron, Ohio, page 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Making the sign of the cross at baptism is retained in the current Book of Worship, and widely practiced (sometimes with oil).&lt;ref&gt;The United Methodist Book of Worship, Nashville 1992, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, on [[Ash Wednesday]] the sign of the cross is almost always applied by the [[Elder (Methodism)|elder]] to the foreheads of the [[laity]].&lt;ref&gt;The United Methodist Book of Worship, Nashville 1992, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; The liturgy for healing and wholeness, which is becoming more commonly practiced, calls for the pastor to make the sign of the cross with oil upon the foreheads of those seeking healing.&lt;ref&gt;The United Methodist Book of Worship, Nashville 1992, p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether or not a Methodist uses the sign for private prayer is a personal choice, but it is encouraged by the bishops of the [[United Methodist Church]].&lt;ref name="UMC 1"/&gt; Some United Methodists also perform the sign before and after receiving [[Holy Communion]], and some ministers also perform the sign when blessing the congregation at the end of the sermon or service.&lt;ref name="UMC 2"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=2871| title = What is the significance of ashes being placed on the forehead on Ash Wednesday?|accessdate = 2007-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformed tradition===
In some [[Reformed churches]], such as the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|PCUSA]] and the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]], [[ Presbyterian Church in America]] the sign of the cross is used on the foreheads during baptism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstpresbyterian-crestview.org/understandingbaptism.htm Understanding Baptism], First Presbyterian Church of Crestview and Laurel Hill, Florida.&lt;/ref&gt; or during an [[Ash Wednesday]] service when ashes are imposed on the forehead. The sign of the cross in some instances is used during Communion and during the Confession of Sin and the Creeds. In instances during a [[Benediction]], when the minister concludes the service using the Trinitarian blessing, a hand is extended and a sign of the cross is made out toward the congregation. This type of benediction is seen in quite a few High Presbyterian groups such as the [[Church of Scotland]] and congregations across the US especially on the  [[ Mid West and East Coast of the United States]].

===Armenian Apostolic===
It is common practice in the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] to make the sign of the cross when entering or passing a church, during the start of service and at many times during [[Divine Liturgy]]. The motion is performed by joining the first three fingers, to symbolize Holy [[Trinity]] and putting the two other fingers in the palm to symbolize the two natures of Christ, then touching one's forehead, below the chest, left side, then right side and finishing with open hand on the chest again with bowing head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armenianchurch.org/index.jsp?sid=1&amp;id=5811&amp;pid=2429&amp;lng=en| title =Making the Sign of the Cross (Khachaknkel)|accessdate = 6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armenianchurch-ed.net/feasts/the-holy-cross/about-the-exaltation-of-the-cross/|title=In the Shadow of the Cross: The Holy Cross and Armenian History|accessdate=6 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222080108/http://www.armenianchurch-ed.net/feasts/the-holy-cross/about-the-exaltation-of-the-cross/|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assyrian Church of the East===
The [[Assyrian Church of the East]] uniquely holds the sign of the cross as a sacrament in its own right. Another sacrament unique to the church is the [[Holy Leaven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | chapter = The Sacrament of the Holy Leaven (Malkā) in the Assyrian Church of the East | title = The Anaphoral Genesis of the Institution Narrative in Light of the Anaphora of Addai and Mari | last = Royel | first = Mar Awa | chapter-url = https://www.academia.edu/12388908/The_Sacrament_of_the_Holy_Leaven_Malka_in_the_Assyrian_Church_of_the_East | editor-first = Cesare | editor-last=Giraudo | ISBN = 978-88-97789-34-5 | year = 2013 | publisher = Edizioni Orientalia Christiana | location = Rome | page = 363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. '''Syed Ali Abbas Jalalpuri''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|سید علی عباس جلالپوری}}}}) was a [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] in [[Government College Lahore]]. He is regarded by the intellectuals of [[Pakistan]] as the [[Will Durant]] of [[Pakistan]]. He had master's degrees in [[Philosophy]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]]. He wrote more than fourteen books on [[Philosophy]], [[History]], and [[Religion]] in Urdu language. He was known as a first-rate scholar, and his books seemed to herald an age of reason in [[Pakistan]].

His opinions on the subjects of [[history]], [[civilization]], [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[metaphysics]], [[folklore]] are held in great esteem.
In his greatest work, Riwayat-e-Falsafa (Story of Philosophy), he tried to educate a common Urdu reader on the subject of Philosophy. This book served its purpose in popularizing the subject it discussed like [[Will Durant]]'s [[The Story of Philosophy]].

Like The [[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]] of [[Pierre Bayle]] and The [[Philosophical Dictionary]] of [[Voltaire]], he wrote a philosophical dictionary, 'Khird Nama Jalalpuri' to explain subject's terminologies in Urdu.
He also wrote “Jinsiyati Mutaley” (A Study of Sex), which presented a great research work on the subject in [[Urdu]] language.

==Tributes==
"Ali Abbas Jalalpuri was a very rigorous historian of Philosophy and Epistemology. As the dominant mode of Philosophy in Indian Subcontinent has been “Analytical” I include him in the first trend as well. He is amongst first of the Modern Pakistani academics who took interest in the “Question of Civilization”, “History of Ideas” and “Academic Clarity”, “Relationship of Metaphysics, Language and Folklore”, the questions which would eventually become most important issues for European Philosopher especially after “Structuralist” revolution in Paris. Jalalpuri was aware of the inconsistencies and contradictions in explaining Iqbal when subjected to traditional Analytical Model of Philosophy. Where to place Iqbal in the Web of Modern Philosophical Ideas?” was the question he faced and he thought he had theperfect solution. Instead of trying to put Iqbal in the Project of Modernity and face the problem of Contradiction, Jalalpuri placed Iqbal among the traditional Islamic Philosophers or the “Kalamist”. So the “Paradox” is “Avoided”, Instead of Philosopher, Iqbal is a “Schoolmen” trying to complete “Islamic Scholasticism” after Ghezali. Jalalpuri is rigorous in his work. due to non existent academy, the trend ended with him. “Completing Islamic Scholasticism” is certainly a part of Iqbal’s work, but it’s a Part, not the whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sherryx.wordpress.com/category/pakistani-literature/ |title=Pakistani literature « Sherryx’s Weblog |publisher=Sherryx.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In 1971, Ali Abbas Jalalpuri wrote a very comprehensive critique of Iqbāl’s theology of modernity. He faults Iqbāl for selective and arbitrary interpretation of the Qur’ānic verses. To him, ambivalence towards pantheism and Ibn Arabi (d. 1240) at some places, his devotion to the pantheist Rumi, and his idea of Absolute Ego make it clear that Iqbāl’s theology has deep roots in
pantheism."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pu.edu.pk/phill/alhikmat/currentissuePDF/1%20MASUD%20Iqbal's%20theology%20of%20modernity.pdf |title=IQBĀL’S APPROACH TO ISLAMIC THEOLOGY Of MODERNITY, KHALID MASUD  |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Citadel''''' is a 1938 British [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] based on the [[The Citadel (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[A. J. Cronin]], first published in 1937. The film was directed by [[King Vidor]] and produced by [[Victor Saville]] at [[Denham Studios]], with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] distributing the film in the UK and the US. It stars [[Robert Donat]] and [[Rosalind Russell]].

==Plot==
Dr. Andrew Manson ([[Robert Donat]]) is an idealistic newly qualified Scottish doctor dedicated to treating the Welsh miners suffering from [[tuberculosis]] in the Welsh mining village of Blaenely and is an apprentice to Dr. Page ([[Basil Gill]]). Initially, he has many lofty scientific goals, but meets local resistance in his research.  After his laboratory and notes are destroyed by the miners, he moves to London, taking working class patients in impoverished conditions. There, his purpose erodes when a chance encounter with a medical school friend, Dr. Frederick Lawford ([[Rex Harrison]]) leads to his quiet seduction by an unethical medical establishment, treating rich [[hypochondriacs]]. Christine ([[Rosalind Russell]]), his wife tries to set him back on the original path. Dr. Philip Denny ([[Ralph Richardson]]), Manson's best friend and still working for improved working class health, dies at the hands of an incompetent, social-climbing surgeon.

==Differences from other versions==
The film is based on the novel, but departs from it in certain vital respects. In the original text the character of Christine Manson is killed off in a road accident at the point when she and her husband have begun to address problems in their relationship. The incident involving the incompetent surgeon occurs, but it is a minor character who dies. Denny survives, and the understanding (not related in the book but implied) is that he and Manson went into practice together.&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, AJ.The Citadel, Gollancz 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1982 BBC adaptation of the novel stays closer to the original text.

The '''Uhuru Movement''' ''(Uhuru'' is the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for freedom.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Swahili-English Dictionary'', Frederick Johnson. Oxford University Press (1951), pp. 138, 491.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) is a socialist movement centered on the theory of African Internationalism, which provides a historical material explanation for the social and economic conditions of African people worldwide. The Movement has been led by the [[African People's Socialist Party]] (APSP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiuhuru.org/ontheground/apsp-usa/about/history.shtml|title=African People's Socialist Party-USA - History|publisher=Asiuhuru.org|accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose chairman is [[Joseph Waller]]. He founded the movement in 1972.

The APSP has formed several organizations, each with specific tasks and purpose. Affiliated organizations include The International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement (InPDUM), [[African Socialist International]] (ASI), UhuruNews.com, African People's Solidarity Committee (APSC), Uhuru Solidarity Movement (USM), Burning Spear Productions, Uhuru Foods, Uhuru Furniture,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sct.temple.edu/blogs/murl/2011/02/22/center-city-uhuru-furniture-offers-green-alternatives-for-unwanted-goods Uhuru profile], sct.temple.edu; accessed September 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; All African People's Development and Empowerment Project (AAPDEP), and African People's Education and Defense Foundation (APEDF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhurumovement.org|title=Uhuru Movement Dot Org: Welcome to the Uhuru Movement!|publisher=Uhurumovement.org|accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views and history==
The Uhuru Movement's political ideology is African Internationalism, which states that capitalism was born parasitic through the attack on Africa and its people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title=African People's Socialist Party-USA Constitution|url=http://uhurunews.com/story?resource_name=african-people-s-socialist-party-usa-constitution|website=uhurunews.com|accessdate=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; African Internationalism holds that [[capitalism]] is imperialism developed to its highest stage,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=War abounds! Break the Silence! Join the Black is Back march on Washington Nov 3rd|url=http://uhurunews.com/story?resource_name=black-is-back-break-the-silence-mobilization-targets-imperialist-world-domination|website=uhurunews.com|accessdate=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; not the other way around, as theorized by Vladimir [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://socialistworker.org/2008/12/02/imperialism-the-highest-stage-of-capitalism|title=Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism|work=SocialistWorker.org|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This belief derives from Karl Marx's 1867 book ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]]'', in which Marx wrote of the condition essential to the emergence of capitalism which he called the "primitive accumulation" of capital.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; African Internationalism is not a static theory that only refers to past conditions, it refers also to the conditions that African people are faced with today. It refers to African people who live inside what it views as imperialist centers, such as the United States and Europe, as an "internal colony".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The Movement has called for the release of all African American prisoners in U.S. prisons, described as "concentration camps", and has described U.S. police forces as an "illegitimate standing army". They have called for the withdrawal of police forces from exploited and oppressed African American communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apspuhuru.org/about/platform/|title=Platform – The African People's Socialist Party|website=apspuhuru.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, tensions between the police in St. Petersburg and the Uhuru Movement were high. Members of the Uhuru Movement frequently protested against the police's treatment of African Americans, usually after the murders of African Americans by police. On October 25th, 1996, violence erupted after a white police officer murdered a young black man driving a stolen car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tampabay.com|title=Violence, fires erupt after police kill driver|last=ROCHEMONICA DAVEYAMY WIMMER|first=TIM|date=October 25, 1996|work=St. Petersburg Times|access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;Cars and buildings were torched, protestors shouted, and rocks, along with other items, were tossed at the police officers at the scene of the shooting. At least 20 protestors were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=St. Petersburg, Florida riots of 1996|date=2018-08-11|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St._Petersburg,_Florida_riots_of_1996&amp;oldid=854416196|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, a large group of Uhuru members went back to the scene and called for the release of the arrested protestors. Sobukwe Bambaata, one of the Uhuru members, stated that the rioting would have never occurred "if the police did not come into our community and treat us like dogs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tampabay.com|title=Uhurus protest police treatment of blacks|last=Landry|first=Sue|date=October 26, 1996|work=St. Petersburg Times|access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although violence broke out in 1996, most of the protests organized by the movement remained peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tampabay.com|title=Group protests handling of man's death at jail|last=Jackson|first=Mike|date=October 13, 1991|work=St. Petersburg Times|access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tampabay.com|title=Marchers attempt to heal the rifts|last=Tubbs|first=Sharon|date=November 17, 1996|work=Tampa Bay Times|access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of work==
The Uhuru Movement is a collective of organizations and institutions that were formed by the African People's Socialist Party.  Each organization was created to deal with specific issues related to the conditions faced by African people under colonialism:

===Political Organizations===
* '''The African People's Socialist Party''' is an African-only political party.  Its leading body is the National Central Committee (NCC) which makes up the leadership of  the Uhuru Movement. 
* '''The African Socialist International''' is the international manifestation of the African People's Socialist Party.

==Controversies and criticisms==
In 2004, Uhuru Movement's leader Omali Yeshitela tore down a Halloween display in St. Petersburg which depicted "a stuffed figure hung by the neck on a homemade gallows". Subsequent opinions&lt;ref name="UhuruvsHalloween"&gt;{{cite news|title=Uhurus vs. Halloween display|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/10/23/Opinion/Uhurus_vs_Halloween_d.shtml|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=October 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and letters&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Uhurus went too far in destroying holiday display|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/10/23/Opinion/Uhurus_went_too_far_i.shtml|date= October 23, 2004|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the ''St. Petersburg Times'' regarding the incident were critical of both the Uhuru Movement and Yeshitela's conduct.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Uhuru Movement came to national attention during the 2008 Presidential campaign season when they interrupted [[Barack Obama]] at a town hall meeting in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], and questioned the candidate with the question, "What about the black community?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93256496|title=Protestor Tells Why He Heckled Obama|publisher=NPR|date=2008-08-04|accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleging that he was not speaking out for Africans on issues such as police brutality, high unemployment, predatory lending, and Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Sunlen|title=Protesters: "What About The Black Community, Obama?"|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2008/08/protesters-what|newspaper=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was criticized by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] for  engaging in demonstrations on January 3, 2009 in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] which the ADL claims encouraged anti-Israel and anti-Zionist rallies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel's Action in Gaza Spurs Anti-Israel Rallies|url=http://www.adl.org/NR/exeres/B79CB3B1-255C-4F5F-AD69-2F3D5944D835,DB7611A2-02CD-43AF-8147-649E26813571,frameless.htm|website=adl.org|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement organized a march in support of [[Lovelle Mixon]] and against the [[Oakland Police]]. Mixon, an [[Oakland, California]] resident, [[2009 Oakland police shootings|had been accused of killing four Oakland police officers]] and died during a shootout after a traffic stop, coincidentally just blocks away from the local Uhuru headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/26/MNDD16N9VP.DTL "Dozens march for Mixon, against police"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', March 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/calling-true-hero-mourners-hold-vigil-suspected-oakland-killer-lovelle-mixon-article-1.372436 "Calling him a 'true hero', mourners hold vigil for suspected Oakland cop killer Lovelle Mixon"], ''[[New York Daily News]]''; accessed June 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many black Oaklanders, as well as those belonging to other racial groups, seemed largely opposed to such sentiments,&lt;ref name="anontip"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120316183225/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/23/BAQD16LJOV.DTL&amp;amp;tsp=1 Woman says she pointed police to Oakland killer], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', March 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; a clear majority of those who regularly campaign against abuses of police power also rejected any attempt to attach legitimacy to Mixon's murder rampage&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kamiya|first=Gary|url=http://www.salon.com/2009/03/28/oakland_police|title=Oakland mourns|publisher=Salon.com|date=2009-03-28|accessdate=2013-01-05|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023233702/http://www.salon.com/2009/03/28/oakland_police/ |archivedate=October 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Caroline Mixon, a cousin of Lovelle Mixon, paid a public tribute to the Oakland police, thanking them for serving and protecting the people of Oakland.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/04/01/BAKB16QC57.DTL|title=Killer's cousin pays tribute to Oakland cops|first=Matthai|last=Kuruvila|date=April 1, 2009|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=April 2, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404044357/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2009%2F04%2F01%2FBAKB16QC57.DTL|archivedate=April 4, 2009|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[University of Mainz|Johannes Gutenberg University]] in [[Mainz]], Germany, the [[General Students' Committee]] (AStA) broke apart in April 2015 as a consequence of internal dispute over purported antisemitism after having organized an Information event about the Uhuru Movement on JGU campus in January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allgemeine-zeitung.de/vermischtes/campus/mainz/jusos-und-campusgruen-knatsch-im-asta-zusammenarbeit-geplatzt--streit-um-referentin-eskaliert_15281044.htm|title=Jusos und CampusGrün: Knatsch im AStA, Zusammenarbeit geplatzt/Streit um Referentin eskaliert|first=Carina|last=Schmidt|date=April 30, 2015|work=[[Allgemeine Zeitung (Mainz)|Allgemeine Zeitung]]|accessdate=September 17, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917191204/http://www.allgemeine-zeitung.de/vermischtes/campus/mainz/jusos-und-campusgruen-knatsch-im-asta-zusammenarbeit-geplatzt--streit-um-referentin-eskaliert_15281044.htm|archivedate=September 17, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AStA distanced itself both from the Uhuru Movement, African People's Socialist Party and its leader Omali Yeshitela stating that "the struggle against racism and the consequences of colonialism should not blind us to other reactionary ideologies" and regretted providing a platform for this movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AStA distanziert sich von der Uhuru-Bewegung|url=http://asta-jgu.de/pressemitteilungen/item/48-asta-distanziert-sich-von-der-uhuru-bewegung|publisher=General Students' Committee at the University of Mainz|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917194439/http://asta-jgu.de/pressemitteilungen/item/48-asta-distanziert-sich-von-der-uhuru-bewegung|archivedate=September 17, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''wall of kindness''' ({{lang-fa|دیوار مهربانی}} ''dīvār-e mehrabānī''; {{lang-ur|دیوار مہربانی}} ''Dewar e meherbani'') is a [[Charity (practice)|charity]] work phenomenon and a kind of [[Altruism|welfare]], usually done by attaching cloth hangers from outside of houses; those encourage people to donate miscellaneous useful things such as winter clothing. It was introduced by an anonymous [[Iran]]ian,&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=kindness|first1=walls of|title=Iranians spontaneously created 'walls of kindness' to help the homeless|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35132157|accessdate=1 January 2016|work=BBC Trending|agency=BBC|issue=What's popular and why|publisher=BBC UK|date=20 December 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice quickly spread throughout the country. The motto of the movement are two sentences which appear on the walls: "leave if you do not need" ({{lang|fa|نیاز نداری بگذار}}) and "take [it] if you need" ({{lang|fa|نیاز داری بردار}}).&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/14/irans-walls-of-kindness-offer-help-to-the-homeless#img-1|title=Iran's 'walls of kindness' offer help to the homeless|first=Saeed Kamali|last=Dehghan|date=14 January 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

Initially started for the [[Homelessness|homeless]] people of the [[Mashhad]], Iran, the act serves a purpose to support the people in need. In response to social media, large numbers of people are taking part as a campaign and it has helped many homeless or otherwise destitute people during the cold winter weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.dawn.com/news/1174670|title=The wall of kindness: An Iranian venture to feed the poor comes to Pakistan|first=Zoya|last=Anwer|date=25 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/02/07/449021/Pakistan-happiness|title=PressTV- Wall of Kindness spreads happiness in Pakistan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new Wall of Kindness was recently witnessed in Amman/Jordan at the Landmark Amman Hotel on November 21st, 2017, which marked the first day of rain, inviting generous souls including children to donate clothes anonymously for the most in need ahead of the winter season. After donations are received, the laundry team at the hotel picks up the clothes, cleans them, irons them, wraps them up and hangs them back so they are available for the recipients, just like brand new items.   @landmarkAmman



Similar walls known as "Neki ki Deewar" have sprung up in multiple cities across India such as [[Allahabad]], [[Bhilwara]], [[Jhalawar]], [[Mysore]], [[Chandigarh|Chandigrah]], [[Bhopal]], [[Dehradun]], [[Korba, Chhattisgarh|Korba]] and [[Kolkata]] sometimes even having more supply than demand of clothes. The walls are also serving unexpected purpose of keeping walls clean and free from spitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/neki-ki-deewar-turns-santa-claus-for-the-needy-across-india/story-Bfm7UtYxXRovfEg1Ze19yH.html|title=‘Neki ki Deewar’ turns Santa Claus for the needy across India|date=2016-12-25|newspaper=Hindustan Times|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/wall-of-kindness-bring-warmth-and-happiness-to-needy-people-in-bhopal/story-yD6hgrBwac9RHAvqPioWqI.html|title=‘Wall of kindness’ bring warmth and happiness to needy people in Bhopal|date=2016-09-18|newspaper=Hindustan Times|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millenniumpost.in/NewsContent.aspx?NID=349791|title=Wall of Kindness: Helping without boasting|website=Millennium Post|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/wall-of-kindness-bring-warmth-and-happiness-to-needy-people-in-bhopal/story-yD6hgrBwac9RHAvqPioWqI.html|title=‘Wall of kindness’ bring warmth and happiness to needy people in Bhopal|date=2016-09-18|newspaper=Hindustan Times|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170210/jsp/saltlake/story_134883.jsp |title= Wall reaches discarded stuff to needy|date=2017-10-10|newspaper= https://www.telegraphindia.com/ /|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The [[economy of Iran]] was hit when sanctions were imposed by the [[Western World]]. As the situation became worse, with an increasing number of unemployed, many could not afford clothes. Inflation caused particular difficulties for those in need. In the winter of 2015, young Iranians in Sajjad Boulevard in Mashhad came up with the idea. The main theme was to meet the demand for resources from charities. For the first time, a wall symbolizes unity rather than separation and the community has been asked to donate voluntarily. As soon as the attempt came to the attention of various social and mass media platforms, it was supported and praised by citizens as well as netizens.

Young Iranians took the chance to strengthen the bonds of community. The campaign went smoothly despite the risk of misuse and loss of resources. People were responsive and well aware of the fact that most vulnerable should get priority.
 
Winter clothing disbursed among mass number of people as a welfare had been seen before,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=concerned to reach blankets|title=Reach winter clothes to cold-hit areas swiftly: PM|url=http://www.bssnews.net/newsDetails.php?cat=0&amp;id=455096&amp;date=2014-12-13|accessdate=13 February 2016|agency=BSS|date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but still, the idea was innovative and showed much intelligence.

==Impact ==
The sharing works of charity had a great impacts of religious point of view regarding [[Islamic]] country like Iran. Like in other religions, charitable work is considered a virtue in Islam, which has driven people to do more for humanity. Like in Iran, people in Pakistan are showing their humanity via this initiative.
