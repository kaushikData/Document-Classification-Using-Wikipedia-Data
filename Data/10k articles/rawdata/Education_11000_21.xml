Founded in 1994, '''Alternatives''', Action and Communication Network for [[International Development]], is a [[non-governmental]], [[international solidarity movement|international solidarity]] organization based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada.

Alternatives works to promote justice and equality amongst individuals and communities worldwide. Active in over 35 countries, Alternatives supports local, community-based initiatives working towards the greater economic, social, and political rights of people and communities affected by poverty, discrimination, exploitation, and violence.

The organization publishes the ''[https://archive.is/20110728120458/http://www.alternatives.ca/fra/journal-alternatives/publications/nos-publications/article/fra/journal-alternatives/?lang=fr '''Le Journal des Alternatives''']'' newsletter, a publication inserted every three months in Montreal's French paper [http://www.voir.ca/portal/front.aspx?zone=1 ''Le Voir'']. Alternatives also publishes the [http://www.alterinter.org/?lang=en '''''Alternatives International Journal'''''], a monthly publication in English distributed electronically.

Alternatives Montreal is the headquarters of an International Federation consisting of nine NGOs spread across the world. [http://www.alternativeniger.org/ Alternative-Niger], Alternatives Asia (New Delhi), [[Alternative Information Center]] (Jerusalem), [http://www.forumalternatives.org/ Forum Macrocain des Alternatives Sud], [[:fr:Initiative pour un autre monde|Initiative Pour un Autre Monde]], [http://www.terrazul.m2014.net/ Institut Alternatives Terrazul], [[Khanya College]], and [http://www.teachercc.org/ Teacher Creativity Center].

==Vision==
Alternatives knows that, through the development of sustainable societies, another world is possible. This belief is grounded in the engagement, experience, and values of Alternatives' members and the social movements to which they belong.

• In this world, women, men and children will live in dignity and respect, and will equitably share the power and resources they need to live and thrive.

• In this world, the diversity of peoples and persons will be respected, as will the human, civil, economic, social, and cultural rights of all of its inhabitants.

• In this world, solidarity, cooperation, respect for the environment, participatory democracy, and peace will be the pillars that hold it aloft.

• In this world, founded upon sustainable, just, and democratic social and economic development, construction has already begun at a local, national, and global level.

==Mission statement==
Alternatives' mission statement (2009) reads: "Strengthened by our vision and national and international experience, Alternatives is an organization that works for solidarity, justice, and equity the world over. Alternatives' aim is to help the networking, building, and promoting of innovative initiatives in popular and social movements that are fighting for economic, social, political, cultural and environmental rights."

The organization says that it wants to "strengthen citizen action and reinforce the contribution of social movements in the construction of sustainable societies."

==International program==
Alternatives is present in [[Latin America]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], as well as Central, South and Southeast [[Asia]].

Alternatives Montreal is the headquarters of a federation consisting of nine NGOs spread across the world. [http://www.alternativeniger.org/ Alternative-Niger], Alternatives Asia (New Delhi), [[Alternative Information Center]] (Jerusalem), [http://www.forumalternatives.org/ Forum Macrocain des Alternatives Sud], [[:fr:Initiative pour un autre monde|Initiative Pour un Autre Monde]], [http://www.terrazul.m2014.net/ Institut Alternatives Terrazul], [[Khanya College]], and [http://www.teachercc.org/ Teacher Creativity Center].

In each of these regions, the organization works in direct partnership with groups of women and men who are struggling for progress, respect and justice; as well as the peace and [[sustainable development]] of their community, their environment, and their region.

Alternatives supports network creation between groups so that they can benefit from their shared experiences and successes. Network formation is crucial since it allows for a deepened analysis and comprehension of the conflicts affecting their communities from the outside.

Alternatives' and its partners' international solidarity projects are centered upon:
* The environment and sustainable development
* Democracy
* Rehabilitation of communities affected by war
* [[Good governance]]
* Socio-economic justice and equality
* Civil, political, economic, social and [[human rights]]
* The fight against poverty
* [[Women's rights]], equality between genders, the inclusion of women in all spheres of society
* Education and inclusion of youth
* Civil society development, management, and [[autonomy]]
* Freedom of organization, of information, of the press, and of religion

== Criticism ==
Alternatives has been criticised as a political organisation supporting "left-leaning causes" through taxpayer funds, provided by the [[Canadian International Development Agency|Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)]]. The Conservative government noted that the Alternatives' board includes "supporters of Hezbollah and Hamas, such as Ali Mallah, vice-president of the Canadian Arab Federation." In addition, the government was reported to have been concerned regarding a 2008 "education camp" at Saint-Alphonse de Rodriguez in Quebec, was attended by "500 motivated militants" from Lebanon, Iraq, and Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Funding for leftist group to be cut|last=Ivison|first=John|date=December 5, 2009|work=National Post|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth Internship Programs==
Alternatives organizes overseas youth internship programs (such as Alternatives' [[NetCorps]] program), with the aim of developing a sense of solidarity and curiosity about other regions within youth. These internships emphasize understanding [[Third World]] realities and encouraging actions that will advance Alternatives' message of justice. Thanks to the internships, hundreds of young people have had the opportunity to participate in uncommon professional, cultural, and human experiences.

Alternatives' Internships Program for 2009-2010 offers internships funded by the Québec Sans Frontières Program of Québec's Ministère des relations internationales.

The 2009-2010 Program offered 4 types of internships, under the following 3 themes:

The Rooftop Garden Project is a combination of hydroponic cultivation, permaculture, organic agriculture and collective gardening. It has inspired numerous initiatives in Québec, Canada and elsewhere in the world.

The new green community spaces have been designed as collective gardens, making participation possible in both public and private areas. This is founded in a desire to offer some simple food production models that are affordable, environmentally friendly and easy to adapt for use in both the South and the North, in a response to growing urbanization, pollution and growing urban poverty.

Biannually, there are general [[elections]]. Turnout declined from about 70% in 1965 to 28.29% in the elections of 2007.

The HSG also includes regulations on the funding of the ÖH and its parts and the duties and rights of the students representatives.

== History ==
* 1945: foundation of the ÖH
* 1946: first general election
* 1947: ÖH becomes a public [[statutory]] body
* 1950: ÖH obtains the right to formally examine laws concerning education
* 1952: first demonstration against [[student fee]]s
* 1959: the ÖH establishes the [[Austrian Student Aid Foundation]] (also: '''home4students''')&lt;ref&gt;http://www.univie.ac.at/archiv/rg/1.htm#20&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1962: one week strike
* 1973, 1975: strengthening of the position of the ÖH by new laws

The '''British Schools Museum''' is an educational museum based in original [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] and [[Victorian era|Victorian]] school buildings in [[Hitchin]] in [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture24.org.uk/am19731 British Schools Museum], [[Culture 24]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum complex is made up of [[Grade II listed]] school buildings housing infants, girls and boys schools with houses for Master and Mistress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukschoolmuseumsgroup.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=15 British Schools Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308000816/http://www.ukschoolmuseumsgroup.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=15 |date=March 8, 2012 }}, [http://www.ukschoolmuseumsgroup.org.uk/ UK School Museums Group] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122132745/http://www.ukschoolmuseumsgroup.org.uk/ |date=January 22, 2010 }}, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a [[Bell-Lancaster method|monitorial schoolroom]] based on the educational theories of [[Joseph Lancaster]] for 300 boys, which opened in 1837, and a rare galleried classroom, dating from 1853.

==History of the school==
[[Image:hitchinschoolsnew.jpg|thumb|left|The school buildings of 1853 (left), 1837 (centre) and 1904 (right).]]
The first school on the site was a schoolroom for 200 boys and 100 girls. It was founded in 1810 by local lawyer [[William Wilshere (1754–1824)|William Wilshere]] in a disused malthouse. This schoolroom was the first [[monitorial system|monitorial school]] for the sons of the poor in Hertfordshire. Teaching was based on Joseph Lancaster's methods of monitorial teaching. He developed a system in which large numbers of younger scholars could be taught by older scholars under the supervision of the master (for boys) or mistress (for girls). This method continued until the Revised Code of 1862 that brought in the Pupil Teacher method of teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Aldrich, An Introduction to the History of Education (London, 1982), p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; The monitorial system was changed as it was the general consensus that having children teach other children, when they are not well educated themselves, proved to be problematic. The Pupil Teacher method involved an older scholar being given training and being paid to teach. The government hoped that this would increase the number of teachers in the future, using a system that could be described as an apprenticeship in teaching.&lt;ref&gt;P.H.J.H. Gosden, How They Were Taught (Oxford, 1969), p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school grew steadily and to such an extent that in 1837 a new schoolroom was built that could hold 300 boys. This was completed in 1838, and the original school in the converted malthouse then included an infants school as well as the girls'. HM Inspector of Schools [[Matthew Arnold]] visited the school in 1852 and reinforced the 1849 recommendation of inspector J D Morrell that the boys' school would benefit from a new classroom. A new Gallery classroom for 110 pupils was completed in February 1854.

[[Image:hitchinschools2.jpg|thumb|The 1857 school building with the houses for the Master and Mistress to the left.]]
In 1857, it was decided by the School's Board of Trustees to completely rebuild the Girls' and Infants' School. The new building was completed in 1858 together with adjoining houses for the Master and Mistress. When Matthew Arnold paid a return visit to the school in 1867 he reported that the new buildings were "excellent".

By 1904 additional classrooms were needed because of the growing number of pupils, and these were built in 1905, but by 1929 the school was too small (and quite worn out!) and the Boys' and Girls Schools transferred to the new [[Wilshere Dacre School]] in the town. The Infants School carried on in the original buildings, but because of the number of evacuees who were sent to Hitchin at the outbreak of [[World War II]] the school reverted to a Junior Mixed Infants School in 1940. This school continued on the site until 1969, when it closed, but the buildings were taken over by [[North Hertfordshire College]] as the Queen Street Activities Centre.

==Recent years==
The buildings were listed as Grade II in 1975 for their importance as a site of historic school architecture. Mrs Jill Grey, a local educational [[historian]], opened a small museum in one of the [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] classrooms. In July 1990 North Herts College left the site and [[Hertfordshire County Council]] put the buildings up for sale. The Hitchin British Schools Trust was formed and by 1994 were successful in purchasing the buildings. The Trust, mainly through the efforts of volunteers, has restored the schoolrooms to reflect their original condition, and work continues to improve them. The museum is visited by adults and groups of children from all over the country who are interested in seeing how their ancestors were taught.

The [[BBC]] filmed scenes from the 2010 children's television series ''[[Just William (2010 TV serial)|Just William]]'' at Hitchin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4909">'''Carl Bereiter''' is an education researcher, professor emeritus at the [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]], [[University of Toronto]] known for his research into [[knowledge building]].

==Contributions==
His areas of research are:

* Knowledge building
* [[Knowledge age]]
* [[Knowledge worker]]s
* Research design
* [[Intentional learning]]
* Instruction
* Cognitive psychology
* Educational policy
* Educational technology.

Carl Bereiter is one of the pioneers of [[Computer Supported Cooperative Learning|Computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL)]].
In collaboration with [[Marlene Scardamalia]], he introduced and developed the theory of "knowledge building". He is one of the main researchers of Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments (CSILE), the first networked system for [[collaborative learning]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ikit.org/fulltext/CSILE_KF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The second generation of product was renamed [[Knowledge Forum]].

Bereiter is one of the founders and leading researchers of the [[Institute for Knowledge Innovation and Technology|Institute for Knowledge Innovation and Technology, (IKIT)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ikit.org/&lt;/ref&gt; His educational contributions, along with those of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Howard Gardner]], and others, are profiled in Fifty Modern Thinkers on Education.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0415231264/&lt;/ref&gt;

He became well known for a 1966 proposal cowritten with [[Siegfried Engelmann]] on the persistent gap between inner city and middle class children in educational achievement that appeared in ''Teaching Disadvantaged Children in the Preschool''.&lt;ref&gt;Teaching Disadvantaged Children in the Preschool nglewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall 1966&lt;/ref&gt; This position came to be called the cultural deficit hypothesis. This provoked a response by [[William Labov]] encapsulated in a much reprinted paper called "The logic of non-standard English."&lt;ref&gt;The logic of non-standard English. In J. Alatis (ed.), Georgetown Monograph on Languages and Linguistics 22. Pp. 1-44&lt;/ref&gt; that argued that cultural and linguistic difference rather than deficit lay behind much of the gap. Bereiter has claimed that he was misread by his critics.

A '''Carnegie library''' is a [[library]] built with money donated by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] businessman and philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]]. A total of 2,509 Carnegie libraries were built between 1883 and 1929, including some belonging to [[Public library|public]] and [[university library]] systems. [[List of Carnegie libraries in the United States|1,689]] were built in the [[United States]], [[List of Carnegie libraries in Europe|660]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[List of Carnegie libraries in Canada|125]] in [[Canada]], and [[List of Carnegie libraries in Africa, the Caribbean, and Oceania|others]] in [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]], [[Serbia]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Mauritius]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Fiji]].

At first, Carnegie libraries were almost exclusively in places where he had a personal connection - namely his birthplace in Scotland and the [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] area, his adopted home-town. Yet, beginning in the middle of 1899, Carnegie substantially increased funding to libraries outside these areas.

In later years few towns that requested a grant and agreed to his terms were refused. By the time the last grant was made in 1919, there were 3,500 libraries in the United States, nearly half of them built with construction grants paid by Carnegie.

==History==

[[File:Carnegie motto, Edinburgh Central Library.JPG|thumb|Carnegie's library motto over the entrance of [[Edinburgh]]'s [[Central Library, Edinburgh|Central Library]].]]
The first of Carnegie's public libraries, [[Dunfermline Carnegie Library]] was in his birthplace, [[Dunfermline]], [[Scotland]]. It was first commissioned or granted by Carnegie in 1880 to [[James Campbell Walker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Campbell Walker|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200760|website=Dictionary of Scottish Architects|accessdate=September 3, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916211859/http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200760|archivedate=September 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would open in 1883. The locally quarried sandstone building displays a stylized sun with the carved motto "Let there be light" at the front entrance.

The first library in the United States to be commissioned by Carnegie was in 1886 in his adopted hometown of [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania|Allegheny]], [[Pennsylvania]] (now the North Side of [[Pittsburgh]]). In 1890, it became the second of his libraries to open in the USA. The building also contained the first Carnegie Music Hall in the World.

The first Carnegie library to open in the United States was in [[Braddock, Pennsylvania|Braddock]], Pennsylvania, about 9 miles up the Monongahela river from Pittsburgh, and home to one of the Carnegie Steel Company's mills in 1889. It was the second Carnegie Library in the United States to be commissioned, 1887, and was the first of just four libraries that he fully endowed. An 1893 addition doubled the size of the building and included the third Carnegie Music Hall in the United States.
 
Initially Carnegie limited his support to a few towns in which he had an interest.  These would be in Scotland and the [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania area. In America, 6 out of the first 7, 7 of the first 10, and 9 of the first 13 libraries he commissioned are all found in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Architectural critic Patricia Lowry wrote "to this day, Carnegie's free-to-the-people libraries remain Pittsburgh's most significant cultural export, a gift that has shaped the minds and lives of millions."&lt;ref name="old.post-gazette.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/ae/20030302carnegie2.asp|title=Carnegie's Library Legacy|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509112640/http://old.post-gazette.com/ae/20030302carnegie2.asp|archivedate=May 9, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1898, only one library was commissioned in America outside [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area|Southwestern Pennsylvania]]—a library in Fairfield, Iowa, commissioned in 1892. As the first time that Carnegie had funded a library in which he had no personal ties, it helped initiate the funding model that would be used by Carnegie for thousands of additional libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fairfieldculturaldistrict.org/museum.htm |title=Carnegie Historical Museum - Fairfield Cultural District |work=fairfieldculturaldistrict.org |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406015722/http://www.fairfieldculturaldistrict.org/museum.htm |archivedate=April 6, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1899, his foundation funded a dramatic increase in the number of libraries.
This coincided with the rise of [[women's club]]s in the post-Civil War period, which were most responsible for organizing efforts to establish libraries, including long-term fundraising and lobbying within their communities to support operations and collections.&lt;ref&gt;Paula D. Watson, “Founding Mothers:  The Contribution of Women’s Organizations to Public Library Development in the United States”, ''Library Quarterly'', Vol. 64, Issue 3, 1994, p.236&lt;/ref&gt;  They led the establishment of 75–80 percent of the libraries in communities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Teva Scheer, “The “Praxis” Side of the Equation: Club Women and American Public Administration”, ''Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis'', Vol. 24, Issue 3, 2002, p.525&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie believed in giving to the "industrious and ambitious; not those who need everything done for them, but those who, being most anxious and able to help themselves, deserve and will be benefited by help from others."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Carnegie, [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/moa-cgi?notisid=ABQ7578-0149-83 "The Best Fields for Philanthropy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030113062124/http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/moa-cgi?notisid=ABQ7578-0149-83 |date=January 13, 2003 }}, ''The North American Review'', Volume 149, Issue 397, December 1889 from the [[Cornell University Library]] website&lt;/ref&gt; 
Under segregation black people were generally denied access to public libraries in the [[Southern United States]]. Rather than insisting on his libraries being racially integrated, Carnegie funded separate libraries for African Americans. For example, in [[Houston]] he funded a separate Colored Carnegie Library.&lt;ref&gt;This library has been discussed in Cheryl Knott Malone's essay, "Houston's Colored Carnegie Library, 1907–1922", which while still in manuscript won the [[Justin Winsor Prize (library)|Justin Winsor Prize]] in 1997.

The privately organized Colored Library Association of Savannah had raised money and collected books to establish a small Library for Colored
Citizens. Having demonstrated their willingness to support a library, the group then petitioned for and received funds from Carnegie.&lt;ref&gt;Live Oak Public Libraries: Library History,  {{cite web|url=http://www.liveoakpl.org/about/library-history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083719/http://www.liveoakpl.org/about/library-history.php |archivedate=August 19, 2014 |df= }} (main page) {{cite web|url=http://www.liveoakpl.org/upload/CarnegieLibrary100th.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320010810/http://www.liveoakpl.org/upload/CarnegieLibrary100th.pdf |archivedate=March 20, 2015 |df= }} (details), accessed August 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Future [[U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote in his memoirs that he frequently used it as a boy, before the library system was desegregated.&lt;ref&gt;Clarence Thomas, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7hAEZz1Xx8wC My Grandfather's Son: A Memoir]'', HarperCollins, 2008, pp. 17, 29, 30,  Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the library buildings were unique, constructed in a number of styles, including [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]], [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], Classical Revival, and [[Spanish Colonial style|Spanish Colonial]]. [[Scottish baronial style|Scottish Baronial]] was one of the styles used in Carnegie's native Scotland.

In all, Carnegie funding was provided for 1,681 public library buildings in 1,412 U.S.  communities, with additional libraries abroad.  Increasingly after 1908, Carnegie library commissions tended to be in the hands of a relatively small number of firms that specialized in library design.  Tilton benefited from a friendship with James Bertram,  who was responsible for reviewing plans for Carnegie-financed library buildings.  Although the Carnegie program left the hiring of an architect to local officials,  Bertram’s personal letters of introduction gave Tilton a distinct advantage.  As a result,  Tilton won a large number of comparatively modest Carnegie library commissions, primarily in the northeast.  Typically, Tilton furnished all plans, working drawings, details and specifications and then associated with a local architect who would supervise construction and receive 5% of Tilton’s commission. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927051548/http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/peabody/about/Tiltonmonograph.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The architecture was typically simple and formal, welcoming patrons to enter through a prominent doorway, nearly always accessed via a staircase.  The entry staircase symbolized a person's elevation by learning. Similarly, outside virtually every library was a lamppost or lantern,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} meant as a symbol of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]].

Carnegie’s grants were very large for the era and his library philanthropy is one of the largest philanthropic activities, by value, in history. Small towns received grants of $10,000 that enabled them to build large libraries that immediately were among the most significant town amenities in hundreds of communities.&lt;ref&gt;M.J.

== Background ==
[[File:Andrew Carnegie bust, Edinburgh Central Library.JPG|thumb|160px|Carnegie bust in Edinburgh's Central Library]]
Books and libraries were important to Carnegie, beginning with his early childhood in Scotland and his teen years in Allegheny/Pittsburgh. There he listened to readings and discussions of books from the Tradesman's Subscription Library, which his father helped create.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The library : an illustrated history|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-60239-706-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in Pennsylvania, while working for the local telegraph company in Pittsburgh, Carnegie borrowed books from the personal library of [[Colonel James Anderson]], who opened his collection to his workers every Saturday. Anderson, like Carnegie, resided in Allegheny.

In his autobiography, Carnegie credited Anderson with providing an opportunity for "working boys" (that some said should not be "entitled to books") to acquire the knowledge to improve themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clpgh.org/exhibit/anderson.html "Andrew Carnegie: A Tribute: Colonel James Anderson"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040211095856/http://www.clpgh.org/exhibit/anderson.html |date=February 11, 2004 }}, Exhibit, ''Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh''&lt;/ref&gt;
Carnegie's personal experience as an immigrant, who with help from others worked his way into a position of wealth, reinforced his belief in a society based on merit, where anyone who worked hard could become successful. This conviction was a major element of his philosophy of giving in general,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/277203534|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=1948-|first=Murray, Stuart,|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=9780838909911|location=New York, NY|oclc=277203534}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and of his libraries as its best known expression.

==Carnegie formula==
Nearly all of Carnegie's libraries were built according to "the Carnegie formula," which required financial commitments from the town that received the donation. Carnegie required public support rather than making endowments because, as he wrote: 
:"an endowed institution is liable to become the prey of a clique. The public ceases to take interest in it, or, rather, never acquires interest in it. The rule has been violated which requires the recipients to help themselves. Everything has been done for the community instead of its being only helped to help itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carnegie |first=Andrew |title=The Best Fields for Philanthropy |journal=North American Review |date=December 1889 |volume=149 |pages=688–691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie required the elected officials—the local government—to:

* demonstrate the need for a public library;
* provide the building site;
* pay staff and maintain the library;
* draw from public funds to run the library—not use only private donations;
* annually provide ten percent of the cost of the library's construction to support its operation; and,
* provide free service to all.

Carnegie assigned the decisions to his assistant [[James Bertram (Carnegie secretary)|James Bertram]]. He created a "Schedule of Questions." The schedule included: Name, status and population of town, Does it have a library?  Where is it located and is it public or private?  How many books?  Is a town-owned site available? Estimation of the community's population at this stage was done by local officials, and Bertram later commented if the population counts he received were truly accurate, "the nation's population had mysteriously doubled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eOIhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JGMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5747%2C1437834 |title=Thanks, but no thanks |work=The Pittsburgh Press |date=July 17, 1983 |accessdate=May 26, 2015 |author=Gigler, Rich |pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of Carnegie's library philanthropy was maximized by his timing. His offers came at a peak of town development and library expansion in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kevane|first=Michael|last2=Sundstrom|first2=William A.|date=2014-04-30|title=The Development of Public Libraries in the United States, 1870–1930: A Quantitative Assessment|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/543837|journal=Information &amp; Culture: A Journal of History|volume=49|issue=2|pages=117–144|doi=10.1353/lac.2014.0009|issn=2166-3033|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202015258/https://muse.jhu.edu/article/543837|archivedate=February 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1890, many states had begun to take an active role in organizing public libraries, and the new buildings filled a tremendous need. Interest in libraries was also heightened at a crucial time in their early development by Carnegie's high profile and his genuine belief in their importance.&lt;ref&gt;Bobinski, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada in 1901, Carnegie offered more than $2.5 million to build 125 libraries. Most cities at first turned him down—then relented and took the money.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Goldenberg, "Dubious Donations," ''Beaver'' (2008) 88#2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-service stacks==

[[File:SouthSide Library front desk.jpg|thumb|left|1999 photo shows location of original "battleship" desk at South Side branch.

[[File:Fred Rogers at Homewood Branch of Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.jpg|thumb|left|Joyce Broadus, branch manager, greets TV icon [[Fred Rogers]] at massive front desk which she dubbed 'the battleship' at Homewood Branch of Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. This branch was featured in several episodes of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. The 'battleship' was removed in a 2004 renovation.]]

The first five Carnegie libraries followed a closed stacks policy, the method of operation common to libraries at that time. Patrons requested a book from a library staffer, who would fetch the book from closed stacks off limits to the public, and bring it to a delivery desk.

To reduce operating costs, Carnegie created a then revolutionary open-shelf or self-service policy beginning with the Pittsburgh neighborhood branches that opened after the main branch. This streamlined process allowed open access to shelves by patrons. Carnegie's architects designed the Pittsburgh neighborhood branches so that one librarian could oversee the entire operation.

Theft of books and other items was a major concern in this era before electronic anti-theft devices. Thus the library's circulation desk—which replaced the delivery desk used in traditional closed stacks libraries—was strategically positioned just inside the front door. Bigger and more daunting than those used in modern libraries, these desks spanned almost the width of the lobby and acted as a physical and psychological barrier between the front entrance and the book room. Decades later, Joyce Broadus, the manager of Pittsburgh's Homewood branch, was credited with dubbing this design of the front desk "the battleship."

The first of these 'open stack' branches was in the neighborhood of Lawrenceville—the sixth Carnegie library to open in America. The next was in the West End branch—the eighth Carnegie library to open in America. Patricia Lowry describes

&lt;blockquote&gt;located just beyond the lobby, the circulation desk &amp;ndash; no longer a delivery desk &amp;ndash; took center stage in Lawrenceville, flanked by turnstiles that admitted readers to the open stacks one at a time, under the librarian's watchful eye. To thwart thievery, the stacks were arranged in a radial pattern. On each side of the lobby were a general reading room and, for the first time in a library anywhere, a room for children.... The reading rooms were separated by walls that became glass partitions above waist level—the better to see you with, my dear.&lt;ref name="old.post-gazette.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Walter E. Langsam, an architectural historian and teacher at the [[University of Cincinnati]] wrote "The Carnegie libraries were important because they had open stacks which encouraged people to browse .... People could choose for themselves what books they wanted to read."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cincypost.com/news/1999/carn101199.html Al Andry, "New Life for Historic Libraries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201650/http://www.cincypost.com/news/1999/carn101199.html |date=September 30, 2007 }}, ''The Cincinnati Post'', October 11, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This open stacks policy would eventually be adopted by the libraries that previously had opened with a closed stacks policy.

==Continuing legacy==
Carnegie established charitable trusts which have continued his philanthropic work.  However, even before his death they had reduced their involvement in the provision of libraries. There has continued to be support for library projects, for example in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sentra.ischool.utexas.edu/~lcr/archive/fulltext/LandC_34_1_Rochester.pdf The Carnegie Corporation and South Africa:  Non-European Library Services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828132624/http://sentra.ischool.utexas.edu/~lcr/archive/fulltext/LandC_34_1_Rochester.pdf |date=August 28, 2008 }} ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', [http://sentra.ischool.utexas.edu/~lcr/archive/landc-toc-v34-no1.php Volume 34, No. 1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612174149/http://sentra.ischool.utexas.edu/~lcr/archive/landc-toc-v34-no1.php |date=June 12, 2010 }} (Winter 1999), from the [[University of Texas at Austin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that, according to a survey conducted by George Bobinksi, dean of the School of Information and Library Studies at the [[State University at Buffalo]], 1,554 of the 1,681 original buildings in the United States still existed, with 911 still used as libraries. Two-hundred seventy-six were unchanged, 286 had been expanded, and 175 had been remodeled.

While hundreds of the library buildings have become museums, community centers, office buildings, residences, or are otherwise used, more than half of those in the United States still serve their communities as libraries over a century after their construction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Carnegie libraries by state |work= |publisher=American Volksporting Association |year=1996 |url=http://www.ava.org/clubs/holyfamilywalkers/list_of_carnegie_libraries.pdf |accessdate=October 3, 2011 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414202910/http://www.ava.org/clubs/holyfamilywalkers/list_of_carnegie_libraries.pdf |archivedate=April 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; many in middle- to low-income neighborhoods.

In the late 1940s, the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] arranged for microfilming of the correspondence files relating to Andrew Carnegie's gifts and grants to communities for the public libraries and church organs. They then discarded the original materials. The microfilms are open for research as part of the Carnegie Corporation of New York Records collection, residing at [[Columbia University]] Rare Book and Manuscript Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/indiv/rbml/collections/carnegie/index.html|title=Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114092250/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/indiv/rbml/collections/carnegie/index.html|archivedate=January 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archivists did not microfilm photographs and blueprints of the Carnegie Libraries. The number and nature of documents within the correspondence files varies widely. Such documents may include correspondence, completed applications and questionnaires, newspaper clippings, illustrations, and building dedication programs.

UK correspondence files relating to individual libraries have been preserved in [[Edinburgh]] (see the article [[List of Carnegie libraries in Europe]]).

Beginning in the 1930s, some libraries were meticulously measured, documented and photographed under the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] (HABS) program of the [[National Park Service]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/collections/habs_haer/ Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record (HABS/HAER)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516223912/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/collections/habs_haer |date=May 16, 2008 }}, Permanent Collection, ''American Memory'' from the Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt; and other documentation has been collected by local historical societies. In 1935, the centennial of his Carnegie's birth, a copy of the portrait of him originally painted by [[F. Luis Mora]] was given to libraries he helped fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Belmar Public Library |work=Wall, New Jersey |publisher=American towns |url=http://www.americantowns.com/nj/wall/venues/belmar-public-library |accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Carnegie libraries in the United States, whatever their current uses, have been recognized by listing on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The first of these, in [[Carnegie Free Library of Braddock|Braddock, Pennsylvania]], was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in March 2012.

'''Divie Bethune McCartee''' ([[Simplified Chinese]]: 麦嘉缔) (1820–1900) was an [[United States|American]] [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] medical [[Mission (Christian)|missionary]], educator and U.S. diplomat in China and Japan, first appointed by the [[American Presbyterian Mission]] in 1843.

In 1845 he organized the first [[Protestant]] church on Chinese soil. He later served as United States Consul at [[Ningbo]], China and was also judge of the "mixed court" at [[Shanghai]].  His career in Japan led him to be a professor in the [[University of Tokyo|Imperial University at Tokyo]], and he was also Secretary of the Chinese legation there.  His prolific writings covered  [[History of Asia|Asiatic history]], [[Languages of Asia|linguistics]], natural science, medicine and politics in the publications of the [[National Geographic Society|American Geographical Society]], the [[American Oriental Society]] and other associations.

==Early life==
Born in Philadelphia, the oldest son of Dr. Robert McCartee of New York, Divie McCartee entered Columbia University, [[New York City]], at the age of 14 and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School at 20. In June 1843 while engaged in the practice of medicine in Philadelphia, he received a message from the Board of Foreign Missions of the Church that he was needed to go to China as a pioneer and medical missionary. After consulting with members of his family, he agreed to go.

==China==
McCartee sailed for China in 1843 and arrived in [[Ningbo]], [[Zhejiang]], China in 1844. He began working primarily in medicine and [[evangelism]]. He was likely the first Protestant missionary, and certainly the first physician, to reside on Chinese soil following the [[First Opium War]]. He soon mastered the [[Chinese language]], and his linguistic skills would be put to a variety of future uses. He opened a mission at Ningbo, one of the five ports opened to foreign trade and intercourse by the [[Treaty of Nanking]] in 1842.

In 1845 he organized the first [[Protestant]] church on Chinese soil. It was there that he married fellow missionary, Juana M. Knight in 1853. She was the first single [[Presbyterian]] woman to travel to China.

In 1868 or 1869, the McCartees adopted [[Kin Yamei]] (1864–1934), the daughter of Christian colleagues who succumbed to disease when she was two years old.&lt;ref&gt;Chow, Kai Wing;  Lee &amp;  Stefanowska (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  She became the first Chinese woman doctor educated abroad.

In addition to his medical work, he became an adviser and interpreter for American officials and was later vice-consul in Chefoo (present-day [[Yantai]]) and Shanghai. McCartee acted in place of an American [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] until a regular consular service was set up in 1857. In this capacity in May 1861, at the request of United States Flag-Officer Stribling, he entered [[Nanjing]], across the battle lines and helped persuade the "Heavenly King", [[Hong Xiuquan]] of the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taipings]] to promise "non-molestation not only to Americans and Christians, but to all Chinese in their employ." By this effort large numbers of native Christians and their friends were rescued when the Taiping army entered Ningbo.

==Japan==
In 1862 he was appointed vice-consul to Japan. As such he was the first Protestant missionary to work there. His tract translated into Japanese was the first Protestant literature in Japan.

The McCartees returned to Ningpo in 1865 to resume their missionary work. In 1872, they were transferred to the Shanghai mission but resigned shortly thereafter so that Dr. McCartee could join the Shanghai consular staff as interpreter and assessor to the Mixed Court.

In 1872, when the [[María Luz Incident|coolies of the Peruvian ship ‘’Maria Luz’’ were freed]] by the Japanese government upon his suggestion, a commission was appointed from [[Beijing]] to proceed to Tokyo to bring home the freed men, and McCartee was nominated secretary and interpreter, receiving for his services a gold medal and complimentary letters. While on this Chinese government assignment to Japan, McCartee remained in [[Tokyo]] as professor of law and science at the Imperial University (now Tokyo University), curator of the botanical gardens, and later secretary to the Chinese Legation there until 1877.

In 1879 he advised [[Ulysses S. Grant]], the former U.S. president, mediating on the [[Ryukyu Islands]], although both China and Japan rejected his compromise.

McCartee returned to the United States in 1880, and in 1882 visited [[Hawaii]] on business connected with Chinese immigration. In 1885, Dr. McCartee was appointed consul to the Japanese legation in [[Washington, DC]]. Two years later the McCartees were reappointed by the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions to the Japan Mission, where they served until Dr. McCartee's retirement in 1899. That year he returned to the U.S.A. as an invalid and died in San Francisco the following year.

Divie McCartee devoted nearly forty years of his life to work among the Chinese and Japanese. The Chinese Government gave him a gold medal in recognition of his services in connection with the suppression of the [[Macau]] [[coolie]] traffic, and later he received the title of Consul General for services in the Chinese legation. From the Japanese Government he received the decoration of the Fifth [[Order of the Rising Sun]]. He left a wife and four brothers-Peter, Robert, George, and Charles McCartee. His remains were buried at [[Newburgh (city), New York]].

==Archival Collections==

The [[Presbyterian Historical Society]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], has a collection of Divie Bethune McCartee's [http://www.history.pcusa.org/collections/research-tools/guides-archival-collections/rg-177 correspondence.]

The [[University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennsylvania's]] [http://www.library.upenn.edu/rbm/ Rare Book and Manuscript Library] has a collection of handwritten notes by McCartee on Chinese and Japanese archaeology, geography, natural history, philology and other topics.

The [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University]] [http://www.ansp.org/] has zoological specimens sent from China by McCartee.

The Platform was first established in 1993 by rehabilitation centres in France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Its secretariat is located in Brussels, Belgium.

==Main activities==
The European Platform for Rehabilitation operates a range of services in the areas of [[professional development]], research and innovation and public affairs. EPR is also active in the field of quality of services, and has developed its own [[quality system]]: [[European Quality in Social Services|EQUASS (European Quality Assurance for Social Services)]].
EPR is a member of the Social Platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us &gt; EPR&amp;nbsp;– European Platform for Rehabilitation|url=http://www.socialplatform.org/AboutUs.asp?DocID=17347|publisher=Platform of European Social NGOs (socialplatform.org)|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a seat at the EU’s High Level Group on Disability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The High Level Group on Disability|url=http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/soc-prot/disable/hlg_en.htm|publisher=[[European Commission]] (ec.europa.eu)|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as participatory status with the [[Council of Europe]]. EPR receives structural funding under the [[European Commission]] [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]], and is involved in a number of projects funded by the European Commission.

==Projects==
The European Platform for Rehabilitation is currently involved in the "Assistive Technologies and Inclusive Solutions for All (ATIS4all)" project funded by EU´s Policy Support Programme - Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme. ATIS4all project aims to improve the accessibility of [[assistive technology]] (AT) for all. Its main objective is to encourage an open discussion in order that a greater sharing of knowledge and expertise among key experts and users takes place. This is to be done while assuring the key principle that Human Rights are to be enjoyed equally by all people, including those with disabilities, the elderly and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The project started in January 2011, and is expected to last for three years. EPR takes part in the project consortium, along with other major European organisations and stakeholders in the field of assistive technologies and integration. The ATIS4all open European collaborative web portal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The ATIS4all collaborative portal|url=http://collaborativeportal.atis4all.eu/en-GB/default.aspx|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; collecting information about Assistive Technologies and inclusive solutions for all has been launched. ATIS4all network invites interested parties to visit and register to the portal and to join as “supporters” i.e. any organisation working in any field related to ICT-AT and inclusive solutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3305">A '''Fachwirt''' is a higher professional certification in [[Germany]] allocated to level 6 of the [[European Qualifications Framework]], where it was translated to Business Management Specialist. 

To facilitate appreciation of the Fachwirt internationally, the [[Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce]] (''Deutscher Industrie- und Handelskammertag'', DIHK) proposed ''Bachelor Professional'' as the English translation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankfurt-main.ihk.de/imperia/md/content/pdf/berufsbildung/weiterbildung/Abschlusserlaeuterung_Bachelor_professional_englisch.pdf ''Bachelor professional CCI'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dihk.de/ressourcen/downloads/dihk_hrk_durchlaessigkeit.pdf |title=''Für mehr Durchlässigkeit zwischen beruflicher Bildung und Hochschulbildung!'' |access-date=2013-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602033525/http://www.dihk.de/ressourcen/downloads/dihk_hrk_durchlaessigkeit.pdf |archive-date=2013-06-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the danger of confusion with academic degrees, this motion was rejected by the German state ministers of education. Yet, this has not stopped the IHK institutions from issuing certificates in English that show the title "Bachelor Professional" in big letters, with only a small note at the bottom of the page that it is not an university degree. However, owners of the certificate must be very careful not to come into conflict with § 132a Abs. 2 of the German criminal code by using the title in relation to someone located in Germany. Applying for a position solely outside of Germany with the certificate is arguably not affected, however (and is the original purpose of the translation). A legally grey area may be the use of the title on career networks on the Internet (which is actually quite common), where both German and foreign companies are targeted at the same time.

== Characteristics ==

The Fachwirt provides a form of [[continuing professional development]], which is usually pursued following an [[apprenticeship]] and at least one year of professional experience in a recognized occupation. The final examinations, regulated by the German Vocational Training Act, are carried out by specialized committees of the German [[Chamber of Commerce|Chambers of Commerce and Industry]] (DIHK). Learning objectives, defined by DIHK created frameworks, require knowledge in business administration as well as practical and theoretical skills in a particular industrial sector (e.g. ''Handelsfachwirt'' for Trade and Commerce, ''Verkehrsfachwirt'' for Transport Management, ''Fachwirt im Sozial- und Gesundheitswesen'' for Social and Health Services). 

Although not a prerequisite for admission to the final exams, training courses are offered by several, primarily private educational institutions. Depending on the specialization, the curricula suggest coursework of 400 to 800 hours, which is taught in 6 to 24 month of full-time or part-time study, respectively, comparable to almost a full term at university which carries 30 [[European_Credit_Transfer_and_Accumulation_System | ECTS]] representative of 900 hours of course work.

The '''Federation of Estonian Student Unions''' ({{lang-et|Eesti Üliõpilaskondade Liit}}, '''EÜL''') is a federation of Estonian student unions. It was founded on 23 November 1991, shortly after Estonia regained independence. EÜL as umbrella organization currently represents over 95% of Estonian students.

EÜL works closely together with Riigikogu (the parliament), the government, different ministries, higher education institutions and other partners. EÜL is also a leading NGO in Estonia and sometimes also represents students in schools, youth in general or just NGOs in different committees. EÜL is recognised as a partner by the Ministry of Education and Research. EÜL is a member of [[European Students' Union]].

==Structure==

EÜL’s main decision body is the '''EÜL Board''' where all member student bodies are represented. Membership of EÜL is voluntary for a student body but all Estonian students are automatically members of their higher education institution (HEI) student body. There are no membership fees for the students for belonging to student unions or student bodies. EÜL also has a council of 9 members, who is elected by the board every 2 years.

The Board decides main future plans and policies, adopts the plan of work, is in charge of the budget and elects the '''Executive Committee''' (EC) and other committees. The 40-45 member Board is elected by the local unions, all students of all members are eligible to be elected as member of the council or the board. Each member of EÜL shall have 1 member and additional 1-member on EÜL Board for every 2000 students (e.g., a HEI with 6200 students has 4 members on EÜL Board). The Board assembles regularly 5 to 6 times per year.

The Executive Committee currently consists of 2 people with a 2-year mandate – the Chairperson and the Vice-Chairperson.

Since 2000 EÜL ECs have usually had a mandate of one year. From 2006 to 2007 was a transition period in which the start of the mandate was pushed from January to July to be more compatible with local unions democratic cycle thus the mandate for Executive Committees was longer than 12 months.

In February 2009 the Board decided change the mandate of the EC to two full years beginning from 1 July 2009. Concurrently with that, the EC will consist of only the Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson. This is aimed at more professional leadership in EÜL. The Executive Committee is heading EÜL secretariat and EÜL foundations which consists of 12 to 20 employees and project managers working in the EÜL office.

Other structures in EÜL are the '''advisory board''' which advises the EC on strategical decisions and on extraordinary financial issues, and the '''Internal Audit Committee''' which supervises the EC and makes sure that EÜL governance is complying with the law and the decisions of the Board.

Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
When a school district fails its legal obligations to students with disabilities, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] permits the parent to seek a hearing before an impartial hearing officer.  A school district may also request a due process hearing against parents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-698.ZO.html/ Schaffer v Weast], Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. 49 (2005) (Justice O’Connor, Opinion of the Court).  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   Hearings are rare.  Only 5 in 10,000 students seek a hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03897.pdf/ GAO 03-0897], United States Government Accountability Office.  “GAO Report 03-897,” September 2003.  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Expert witnesses have a critical role at due process hearings.  They provide the technical expertise about the student’s disability and the care and educational services the student needs in the classroom.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; 

In 1986, Congress passed the Handicapped Children’s Protection Act, allowing parents who prevail in due process hearings and litigation under the IDEA to recover their legal fees and costs.  The language was modeled on similar provisions in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-5k).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/94-970.pdf/ CRS Report 2008], Henry Cohen.  “Awards of Attorneys' Fees by Federal Courts and Federal Agencies” (Congressional Research Service), June 20, 2008.  Retrieved 18 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Congress’ Joint Conference Committee Report explained that the courts would have discretion to award attorneys’ fees as part of the costs of litigation.  It noted that “The conferees intend that the term ‘attorneys’ fees as part of the costs’ include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian’s case in the action or proceeding.”&lt;ref&gt;132 Congressional Record 16823-25 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;  The statute also directed the GAO to study the costs to parents, including costs of “attorneys and
consultants” in IDEA proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-18.ZD.html/ Murphy J. Souter Opinion] Arlington Central School District v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291 (2006) (Justice Souter, Dissent) (quoting Handicapped Children’s Protection Act, Public Law 99-372, Section 4(b)(3), 100 Stat. 796, 797–98 (1986)).  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, however, the Supreme Court decided the case of [[Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy]].  The Court ruled that because the statutory text of the IDEA did not explicitly state that expert witness fees were covered, parents could not recover them.  The Court reasoned that because the IDEA was enacted under the Spending Clause of the Constitution, Article I, Section 8, the law must “unambiguously” give notice in its statutory text that parents could recover fees.  This meant Congress had to declare in the body of the statute that parents could recover expert witness fees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-18.ZO.html/ Murphy Majority Opinion] Arlington Central School District v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291 (2006) (Justice Alito, Opinion of the Court).  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The IDEA Fairness Restoration Act will amend the statutory text of the IDEA to permit recovery of expert witness fees. Until Congress does, parents must pay their own expert witness fee expenses, even when they prevail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autcom.org/pdf/briefing-memo-idea-fairness.pdf Analysis IDEA Fairness Act] Autism National Committee.  Analysis, IDEA Fairness Restoration Act.  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of the Bill==

The IDEA permits parents who prevail in IDEA cases to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/20/1415.html/ 20 USC 1415] 20 United States Code 1415(i)(3)(B).&lt;/ref&gt;  The IDEA Fairness Restoration Act will enable them to also recover the reasonable costs of expert witnesses.  It will amend Section 615(i)(3) of the IDEA by adding the following at the end, “Inclusion of expert witness fees and other expenses as attorneys' fees. In this paragraph, the term ‘attorneys' fees’ shall include the fees of expert witnesses, including the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian's case in the action or proceeding.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
Parents can recover expert witness fees only when they prevail, and the school system has been found, after an impartial hearing, to have wrongfully denied a child an appropriate education as defined in IDEA. fees.  Parents cannot recover fees if they do not prevail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?position=all&amp;page=E2419&amp;dbname=2007_record/ Cong Rec 2007], Congressman Chris Van Hollen.  “Introduction of the IDEA Fairness Restoration Act,” Congressional Record, November 14, 2007.  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill will align the IDEA with other civil rights statutes that permit recovery of expert witness fees, including Title VII,&lt;ref&gt;[http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21/ Title VII] 42 United States Code 2000e-5(k).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12205-/ ADA] 42 United States Code 12205.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several federal laws permit recovery of expert witness fees, including Voting Rights Act of 1965, Consumer Product Safety Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud Abuse and Prevention Act, Endangered Species Act, the Patent and Copyright Acts, PROTECT Act, Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, Presidential and Executive Office Accountability Act, and the Whistleblower Protections for Contractor Employees of Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration Act.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==Statement of Senator Harkin on introduction==
When Senator Harkin introduced the bill, he explained the reasons for enactment. He said, “This critical legislation will remove the financial barrier that families, especially low- and middle-income families, face as they pursue their children's rights to the free, appropriate public education they deserve and are entitled to under the Fourteenth Amendment...There are . . .times when schools have not fulfilled their responsibilities to provide an appropriate education. In these cases, IDEA provides parents the right to challenge the schools through mediation and due process. To make their argument, families often need access to expert witnesses who can assess the student's needs and testify about whether the current IEP meets those needs. These expert witnesses are a resource that many families cannot afford, but without access to them, families may be unable to make their case. ”&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?position=all&amp;page=S1834&amp;dbname=2011_record/ Cong Rec 2011]  Senator Tom Harkin,   Congressional Record, March 17, 2011.  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2002 study found that more than 1/3 of children with disabilities lived in households with incomes of $25,000 or less, compared to 24% of the general population, and 2/3 of children with disabilities lived in families that earned less than $50,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seels.net/designdocs/SEELS_Children_We_Serve_Report.pdf.

The '''Institut français en Inde''' is part of the worldwide network of "[[Institut français|French institutes]]". The Delhi office is the only in [[India]], the [[French Institute of Pondicherry|Pondichery antenna]] of the institute being a research facility more than a cultural centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifmapp.institutfrancais.com/les-if-dans-le-monde#|title=Les Instituts français dans le monde - |publisher=Institut français}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
This French Institute was inaugurated on 29 March 2012 by Mr [[Xavier Darcos]], then president of the French Institute alliance.&lt;ref name="ifindia.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifindia.in/content/history |title=History |publisher=Institut Français India}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, French cultural activities in Delhi have existed under various forms before the official opening of the institute. Before 2012, all cultural activities related to the French embassy were supervised by [[Culturesfrance]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000023332301&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Institute entertains close links with the [[French Embassy in India]], the local [[Alliance Française]] and other French-teaching establishments like the [[Lycée Français de Delhi]].

The Lycée français de Delhi and the [[Center for Social Research and Humanities (New Delhi)|Centre for Social Research and Humanities]] are also based within its walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csh-delhi.com/presentation|title= Mission|publisher=CSH }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is located next to the 5 stars hotel 'Taj Mahal', the [[Parsi]] [[Parsi cemetery (New Delhi)|cemetery]] and a few hundred meters from the [[Rajpath]] and [[India Gate]]&lt;ref name="ifindia.in"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wego.here.com/directions/mix//2,-Dr-A-P-J-Abdul-Kalam-Road,-New-Delhi-110011-DL,-Inde:loc-dmVyc2lvbj0xO3RpdGxlPTIlMkMrRHIrQStQK0orQWJkdWwrS2FsYW0rUm9hZDtsYW5nPWVuO2xhdD0yOC42MDIzNDA2OTgyNDIxODg7bG9uPTc3LjIyMTY0MTU0MDUyNzM0O3N0cmVldD1EcitBK1ArSitBYmR1bCtLYWxhbStSb2FkO2hvdXNlPTI7Y2l0eT1OZXcrRGVsaGk7cG9zdGFsQ29kZT0xMTAwMTE7Y291bnRyeT1JTkQ7ZGlzdHJpY3Q9UHJlc2lkZW50cytFc3RhdGU7c3RhdGU9RGVsaGk7c3RhdGVDb2RlPURMO2NvdW50eT1OZXcrRGVsaGk7Y2F0ZWdvcnlJZD1idWlsZGluZztzb3VyY2VTeXN0ZW09aW50ZXJuYWw |title= New Delhi|publisher=HERE WeGo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The institute’s cultural center participates actively to the local and national art scene, by organising dozens of cultural events every year, on a local, regional or national basis. It also participates to external events, within the promotion of friendly ties between France and other [[French language|francophone countries]] and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extravagantindia.com/fr/Les-partenaires/institut-fran%C3%A7ais-inde|title=Institut Français Inde |publisher=Extravagant India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these events, the center offers regular French classes and international certifications of proficiency in French (such as [[DELF]], [[DALF]], [[DELF Junior]], [[DELF Pro]], TCF and TEF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifindia.in/content/learn-french|title=Learn French |publisher=Institut Français India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Institute - New Delhi is also engaged in giving online access to learning material; it created http://india.salledesprofs.org/, in order to give French teachers in India better access to approved teaching resources.

It cooperates intimately with Indian universities to propose joint courses to Indian and French students alike. In 2011 alone, 2500 Indian students chose to study in France via the joint programs created by the Institut français.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifindia.in/content/university-cooperation|title=University Cooperation |publisher= Institut Français India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article describes the selection process, by country, for entrance into the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]].

The International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is an annual mathematics olympiad for students younger than 20 who have not started at university.

Each year, participating countries send at most 6 students. The selection process varies between countries, but typically involves several rounds of competition, each progressively more difficult, after which the number of candidates is repeatedly reduced until the final 6 are chosen.

Many countries also run training events for IMO potentials, with the aim of improving performance as well as assisting with team selection.

== IMO Selection process by country ==

=== Argentina ===
In [[Argentina]], the [http://www.oma.org.ar Olimpíada Matemática Argentina] is organized each year by Fundación Olimpíada Matemática Argentina. All students that took and passed the National Finals (fifth and last round of the competition) exams, usually held in November; and were born before July 1 21 years ago, are allowed to take two new written tests to be selected for IMO, usually in May. From the results of that tests, six titular students and a number of substitutes are selected to represent Argentina at the International Mathematical Olympiad.

=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], selection into the IMO team is determined by the [http://www.amt.edu.au Australian Mathematics Trust] and is based on the results from four exams:
* The Australian Mathematics Olympiad
* The [[Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad]]
* two IMO selection exams

The Australian Mathematics Olympiad (AMO) is held annually in the second week of February. It is composed of two four-hour papers held over two consecutive days. There are four questions in each exam for a total of eight questions. Entry is by invitation only with approximately 100 candidates per year.

A month after the AMO, the Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad is held (APMO) and the top 25 from the AMO are invited to sit the exam. It is a four and a half hour exam with five questions.

The top 12 students from the AMO and APMO (along with another 12 or so junior students) are then invited to a ten-day camp held in Sydney in the April school holidays. During this camp, two four-and-a-half hour 
selection exams are held, each with four questions. The top six candidates along with a reserve are then announced as part of the team based on their results in the four exams.

In 2011, there were three selection exams, each with three questions in four-and-a-half hours to better simulate the conditions of the IMO.

=== Bangladesh ===
The selection process is organised by [[Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad]].
There are three levels of selection in [[Bangladesh]]. In first two levels the students participate in four academic categories: primary, junior, secondary and higher secondary.

* Divisional: Currently(2011) the country is divided in 13 regions for divisional Olympiad. The number of divisions may increase later. Except Dhaka division, roughly 1000 students participate each of the divisional Olympiads and 60 are selected for the next level. In Dhaka division, where number of students are more than the others, 1600 students participate and 100 to 120 students are selected.&lt;br/&gt; All problems in the divisional test are "To find" problems. The students need not to write down the solution, only the answer is necessary. The test is usually one hour long.
* National: The national Olympiad is a 3-4 hour test depending on the category. In this test the students must write down the solutions of the problems. Some of the winners from junior, secondary and higher secondary categories of this level are selected for the next level.
* The camps: More than one camps are arranged to select students for IMO. The selection process in the camps are not so straight forward as it is in the Olympiads. The students in the camps are closely monitored by the previous campers and coaches and four to six students are selected for IMO.

=== Brazil ===
The Brazilian participants are selected in a two phase process:
1st. The contestants that are awarded medals or honorable mentions in the Brazilian Mathematical Olympiad (OBM) ([[Olimpíada Brasileira de Matemática]])of the year before the IMO are selected to participate in a training process to the IMO.
2nd. The contestants take a series of tests, which have IMO-like level, and the top students are invited to join the Brazilian team that goes to IMO.

=== Belgium ===
The [[Belgium|Belgian]] team is bilingual. The [[Flemish Community|Dutch-speaking community]] selects three participants during the [[Vlaamse Wiskunde Olympiade]]. The [[French Community of Belgium|French-speaking community]] selects their three participants through the [[Olympiade Mathématique Belge]] and additional tests at training weekends.

=== Canada ===
High school students must first write the [[Canada|Canadian]] Open Mathematics Challenge, which takes place around November. If they score high enough in the COMC(normally 70+), they will be invited to write the Canadian Mathematics Olympiad (CMO), [[Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad]] (APMO), and unofficially write the [[United States of America Mathematical Olympiad|USAMO]].

The students with the top scores (conditions permitting) will make the Canadian team and travel to the location of the IMO in that year. Although the team is made up of students from all over Canada, Toronto and its suburbs have produced the most people for the team due to its high population density. The [[Canadian Mathematical Society]] is the organization which selects team leaders and members for the IMO team.

=== China ===
In [[mainland China]], high school students have the annual National Highschool Mathematics Competitions, held on the second Sunday of September. A few competitors of each province with best scores, usually the top 3 to 5( but for these strong provinces, it can be about 15, such as Beijing), will be invited to participate in the China Mathematics Olympiads. Approximately the top 60 competitors of CMO will have a training campus; After two tests, the top 15 competitors in the campus will stay and take another four. Then, the 6 students with top scores will form the Chinese team. China has been very successful in recent twenty years at the IMO.

=== Colombia ===
In [[Colombia]] the selection and preparation of students for math competitions is organized by [http://olimpia.uan.edu.co Olimpiadas Colombianas de Matemáticas]. The process begins with the regional competitions which are held in October and November. The best students of these competitions are invited to the January Training Session. In early March the National Competition or '''Olimpiada Colombiana de Matemáticas''' begins. It consists of a sequence of four examinations: the '''classificatoria''', the '''selectiva''', the '''semifinal''' and the '''ronda final'''. The latter contains a (prior) training session and then two days of IMO-style papers.

Every Colombian high school student can take part in the first "classifying" examination but afterwards students are invited to compete according to their results on the previous examination. The three best students of the three different high school levels of the final round examination are the winners of the Colombian Math Olympiad. Although in principle students of the lower levels may be selected to go to the IMO, it generally takes many years before they can compete with students of the highest level or '''nivel superior'''. After the National Competition the twenty best students of each level are invited to the June Training Session where students undergo the IMO selection process.

=== Croatia ===
''Hrvatsko matematičko društvo'' invites about 20 contestants who performed best at the national level (national level competition is separated by age) to the Croatian Mathematical Olympiad (''Hrvatska matematička olimpijada'', HMO) which consists of 2 days, 4 problems each. The best ~10 are invited to the IMO test, the rest to the MEMO test. The best six at the IMO test and HMO combined are selected for IMO.&lt;!-- source somewhere at http://natjecanja.math.hr --&gt;

=== Cuba ===
In [[Cuba]] the selection process consists (depending on regional conditions of availability of resources, participants and organizers) six levels. Competitions are held to select the best candidates from each school, then from each municipality, then from each province who then are allowed to take part in the National Competition (''Concurso Nacional'' in Spanish). The gold and silver medals (around 20 participants) take a number of further exams closer to the level of International competitions. Thirteen of these are selected to form the National Pre-Selection that trains for up to three months taking also exams out of which the best 6 are selected to form the National team. In a number of years the lack of financial support has allowed only the first member of the team to actually travel and compete in the International mathematical Olympiad. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

=== Cyprus ===
{{main|Cyprus Mathematical Society#High School (Lyceum) Competitions|High School (Lyceum) Maths Competitions in Cyprus}}

In [[Cyprus]] '''Four provincial competitions''' and a '''National (Pancyprian) competition''' are held every year. During this procedure 30 students are selected and Four '''Team Selection Tests''' are held to determine who will be the six member of national team for [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]]

*In every competition or test there are four problem usually covering [[geometry]], [[number theory]], [[algebra]], and [[combinatorics]] (elementary level) and last four hours each.

=== Czech Republic ===
After successfully completing the school and regional rounds, roughly 50 best participants are invited to the national round, where 10 best students are selected to participate in a week-long selection campus. Each day they solve a set of 3-4 problems, taken mainly from the past national olympiads of various countries. On the last day they have to find the answers (this time in form of a number) to rather large set of shorter problems under significant time-pressure. After that the team is selected and before the actual IMO, it competes in traditional Czech-Slovak-Polish Mathematical Contest where the participants can practise their skill under almost identical conditions to IMO.

=== Denmark ===
In [[Denmark]] a national contest open to all high school students is held every year called "Georg Mohr-Konkurrencen" (the Georg Mohr Contest) named after a Danish mathematician. The top 20 of this contest are then invited to another contest where the final team is selected.

=== France ===
The Association Animath, and more precisely the [[:fr:Olympiade Française de Mathématiques|Olympiade Française de Mathématiques]] prepares and selects the French IMO team. Students who succeed at a preselection test can get from Animath a year-long training, after which the team is selected by an IMO-like test.

=== Germany ===
IMO team selection in [[Germany]] is based on the main national mathematical competitions: The [[Bundeswettbewerb Mathematik]] (BWM, the former west German olympiad), the [[Deutsche Mathematik-Olympiade]] (DeMO, the former east German olympiad), and [[Jugend forscht]] (a research competition). Students successful in any of these competitions (e. g. a prize in the second round of the BWM) write two 3-hour exams at their schools, and the 16 best scorers of these exams are invited to a training program consisting of five seminars, where lectures are given and seven team selection tests are written - 4-hour exams determining the actual IMO contestants (additional tests are possible if the team is not uniquely determined after the seven exams).

=== Greece ===
* Θαλής ([[Thales|Thalis]]) - first round
* Ευκλείδης ([[Euclid|Euklidis]]) - second round
* Αρχιμήδης ([[Archimedes|Archimidis]]) - third round

=== Hong Kong ===
[[Hong Kong]] first joined IMO in 1988.

In Hong Kong, the [[International Mathematical Olympiad Preliminary Selection Contest - Hong Kong|International Mathematical Olympiad Preliminary Selection Contest]] is held every year. Around 60 students are selected to receive further training, after three phases of which six students will be selected as the Hong Kong team members, and six will be selected as reserve members. The further training is also known as phase four training.

=== Iceland ===
[[Iceland]] first joined the IMO in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Mathematical Olympiad - Iceland|url=https://www.imo-official.org/country_info.aspx?code=ISL|website=imo-official.org|publisher=International Mathematical Olympiad|accessdate=14 September 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170914201407/https://www.imo-official.org/country_info.aspx?code=ISL|archivedate=14 September 2017|language=English|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iceland, the Icelandic Mathematical Olympiad for Secondary School Students ([[Stærðfræðikeppni Framhaldsskólanema]]) was first held in the winter of 1984-1985, and his been an annual occurrence ever since. It is hosted by the Icelandic Mathematical Organization and the Natural Sciences's Teacher Association. Its goals include increasing the interest of Icelandic secondary school students towards mathematics, and other fields built on a mathematical foundation.

The contest is held in two parts every winter. First, a qualifier held in October of every year on two difficulty levels; upper level, and lower level. The lower level is intended for first year secondary school students, and the upper level for older students. Those who do well in the qualifier are invited to the final competition, held in March.

Alongside honours and awards, the top students are selected to perform in various mathematical olympiads, including the [[Baltic Way (mathematical contest)|Baltic Way]], the [[Nordic Mathematical Contest]], and the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Um keppnina|url=http://stae.is/stak/keppnin|website=stae.is|publisher=Stærðfræðifélag Íslands|accessdate=14 September 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170914202635/http://stae.is/stak/keppnin|archivedate=14 September 2017|location=Iceland|language=Icelandic|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
* The [[Indian National Mathematics Olympiad]] (or INMO) is held every year. This is an invitational exam, and only students who qualify the [[Regional Mathematics Olympiad]] (or RMO) are invited to appear for it. Students qualifying the INMO get to attend the IMO Training Camp at the [[Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education]] at the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]], where further selection tests are used to identify the top six students who will represent the country. The students are also trained by some of the top mathematicians of India. The camp usually runs throughout the month of May. There are two batches of students in the camp, the seniors and juniors. If a student has come to the camp for the first time, he/she is a junior. There can be atmost 6 juniors from class 12. For those who have been to the camp at least once, the INMO is not necessarily required, and they are selected based on their performance in certain postal [[problem sets]].

=== Indonesia ===
In [[Indonesia]], National Mathematical Olympiad is held as a part of [[Indonesia National Science Olympiad|National Science Olympiad]] (Olimpiade Sains Nasional), and has been held annually since 2002. About 100-120 students who pass the province-level test will be eligible to participate in the National Mathematical Olympiad, which is held in August or September. About thirty students are chosen to get into the first training camp, which is held at October through November. About half of them will go to second training camp and participate in the [[Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad]]. At the end, six students are selected to represent the country. The selection depends on the results of regular tests held every week in every training camp, IMO simulation test and APMO.

=== Ireland ===
In [[Ireland]], the top scorers in the [[Junior Certificate]] (a state exam taken around the age of 15-16) are invited by the various universities to take part in the Irish Mathematical Olympiad. The IrMO is held simultaneously in May in each of these universities. The test consists of two three-hour papers, each containing five questions, run on the same day. The top six students are selected for the national team.

=== Italy ===
In [[Italy]], the Mathematical Olympiad is held every year; the full selection process is made up of four stages:
* the so-called ''Archimedean games'', held as a multiple-choice test in all participating high schools in November
* the regional stage, held as a mixed test (multiple choice, numerical answers and proof-writing) in ca. 100 sites in February
* the national stage, held in [[Cesenatico]] at the beginning of May, composed of six problems requiring a full proof
* the team selection test, held in [[Pisa]] at the end of May after a five-day stage, composed of two sessions each containing three problems requiring a full proof.
The six-person team competing in the IMO is determined by summing up the scores of four different competitions: the senior national stage, held each September in Pisa, the Balkan selection test held each February in Pisa (also selecting the team competing in the BMO and in the RMM) composed by two papers with three problems, four and a half hours each, and then the national stage and the May stage held in Pisa.

=== Japan ===
In [[Japan]], Japan Mathematical Olympiad(JMO) is held every year. JMO has two rounds: the first one in January and the second one in February. The best 20 scorers in JMO are invited to the spring training camp in March. The top six students in several tests at this camp are selected for the national team.

=== Latvia ===
In [[Latvia]] a national contest open to all high school students takes place each year. The best participants of regional contests are allowed to participate in the national olympiad held in Riga. The top students are further tested to select the national team.

=== Malaysia ===
The selection is based on the Olimpiad Matematik Kebangsaan, OMK (National Mathematical Olympiad) and the subsequent training camps. Top OMK performers are selected to attend the training camps, and the final IMO representatives are selected based on the students' performance in the camps and race.

=== Mexico ===
The selecting process in [[Mexico]] has 3 stages and is organized by the [[Mexican Mathematical Olimpiad]]. At first stage, each of the 31 states and the Distrito Federal select a team of up to 6 students (10 in the case of the Distrito Federal) which will represent the state in the national contest. The contest is held once at year, in the month of November.
According to the results of this contest, at least 16 students are selected, who will continue to the second stage of the selecting process, the national trainings, which are held from November to April in which the group of 16 students gets reduced to approximately 10.
In May the third stage of the contest is held, in which the six students that will represent Mexico in the next IMO. In similar process the teams for the Centroamerican and Caribbean Mathematical Olimpiad (OMCC) and Iberoamerican Mathematical Olimpiad (OIM) are selected. In March the test for the APMO is solved.

=== Netherlands ===
In the [[Netherlands]] the selecting process consists of three rounds.
*The first round takes place on [[high school]]s. It contains 8 multiple-choice questions, and 4 open questions.
*The second round takes place at twelve different universities. It contains 5 questions where the answer is a certain number and 2 open questions.
*There are a few optional training days and then the third round takes place at the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]]. It contains 5 open questions.
*The best 30 are invited to the training program. Throughout the next year the students take different test: the best 6 students will go to the [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]]. The tests contains 4 or 5 open questions.

=== New Zealand ===
The first selection is based on the September Problems, where the top 24 students are selected and invited to a residential one week training camp. At the end of the camp, approximately 12 students are selected as a squad. The squad receives regular assignments to complete every few weeks as well as sitting the British Maths Olympiad, Australian Maths Olympiad and the APMO. The final six candidates plus one reserve are later selected based on results of the assignments and these tests.

=== Norway ===
In [[Norway]], the [http://abelkonkurransen.no/ Niels Henrik Abels Matematikkonkurranse] is held each year. The first selection, usually in September, consist of a multiple-choice exam with 20 problems. One is given 5 points for each correct answer, 1 point for each unanswered problem and 0 point for a wrong answer. Approximately 10% of the competing students are selected for the second selection, which is held in February. The examination consist of 10 problems, giving 10 points for each correct answer, who are integers between zero and one thousand. 20 students are then selected for a final four-hour-long examination consisting of four problems. While usually the 3 best students are automatically chosen for the final team, the rest 3 are decided by their results in the [[Nordic Mathematical Contest]], which they will compete in afterwards.

=== Pakistan ===
In [[Pakistan]], selection for the IMO participants is quite similar to that in other countries. The process starts one and a half year before a particular IMO; and a test (also known as NMTC - National Mathematics Talent Contest) is taken by the high school students which is organized by the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]]. The test is held in January and the results are announced by April or May. About fifty students out of a 4000 are selected which are called by [[Abdus Salam School of Mathematics]], [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College University]], [[Pakistan]] - usually in September. The fifty selectees are taught at the school for a week or two and are then tested at the last two days of the camp. This process, involving the top 50, is known as First Camp. Based on the performance in the test, about 20 students are further selected for the Second Camp, and the rest are dropped. These 20 students are joined by 30 students (from NMO - National Mathematics Olympiad) in the Second Camp. Ten students from the 50 are then selected, again based on their performance in a test. Third Camp is the final camp, and 5 are screened out of these 10. These would be the finalised participants for IMO.

Alternatively, high school students from all over Pakistan take NMO (National Mathematics Olympiad) which is organized by Abdus Salam School itself. About 30 are selected which join the NMTC top 20 students in Second Camp. This test is held after the result of the First Camp of NMTC is announced. Students who do not qualify the First Camp of NMTC can still take the NMO if they wish to come to the Second Camp.

Sometimes, the selection process may involve more than three camps and the number of students selected per camp can vary from the figures provided above.

=== The Philippines ===
The selection process starts with the Philippine Mathematical Olympiad (PMO), which includes a regional level, an area level, and a national level. The top twenty students in the national level of PMO will be invited to a one-month training camp. The top students (at most six) in the selection tests given during this training camp will make up the IMO team.

=== Portugal ===
In [[Portugal]], there are four selection steps. The three first are the exams of the [http://www.mat.uc.pt/~opm/ Portuguese Mathematics Olympiad] and the last is composed of several exams made by [http://www.mat.uc.pt/~delfos Projecto Delfos], who also prepares the students for international competitions.

=== Romania ===
In [[Romania]] those that enter the Romanian National Team on Mathematical Olympiad are selected from four rounds: School, City, County and National. In the case of Bucharest, being some 5 times larger than the largest county, as well as having larger schools, the rounds are: school, sector (a borough, roughly), city and national. From the first two rounds the advancing pupils are chosen using a minimum grade threshold (usually 8.00/10.00). From the city/county round advance the top five (fewer in certain cases), with a playoff round organised if necessary. The national round offers fifteen medals (five of each colour). A team (plus reserve) is selected from the medal winners, usually following a playoff round.

=== Russia ===
Russia has very extensive system of selecting and training participants for IMO. Different aspects of solving mathematical problems are studied and revealed: combinatorics, logics, structural arrangement and proofs. All problems are evaluated from 7 points. Top participants obtain certificates of 3 degrees ("1st", "2nd" and "3rd diploma") and often additional "commendable certificates". Totally up to half of participants (in the last 3 rounds) gain diplomas.

The official rounds (each picking about 1/3 top of the previous) are: School, Borough, Region, Okrug (a district, roughly) and national. More details:
* '''School round''' ({{lang-ru|Школьный этап}}, I stage) is a public stage - every interested pupil of 4-11 grade can participate. Completely organized by every school this competition aimed more at popularisation than at selection.
* '''Borough round''' ({{lang-ru|Районный этап}}, II stage) for some schools (specifically ones that has winners of region round) is equal to the School round.
* '''Region round''' ({{lang-ru|Областной этап}}, III stage) is the first which brings together participants in one place to live for some days. It has two rounds on its own. In [[Moscow]] they are separated with process of selection, but in less populated regions pupils take part in both. In present days problems for all rounds starting with region round are created by special central committee. There are juries in each region of roughly constant membership. Winners of the region rounds usually have privileges for high-school entering.
* '''Okrug round''' ({{lang-ru|Окружной, зональный этап}}, IV stage) is an intermediate before the final round. Problems usually corresponds to non-trivial mathematical facts, often to recent discoveries or their particular cases. Singular schools (e.g. [[Saint Petersburg Lyceum 239]]) have the right to present their pupils directly to okrug round.
* '''National round''' ({{lang-ru|Всероссийский этап}}, V stage) aimed at selection the most prominent pupils for participation in IMO. For this sake about 14 top of national round from 10th and 11th grades (usually "1st diplomas") are combined in following summer and winter "gatherings" for special training and further selection.

=== South Africa ===
In [[South Africa]] those who would be members of the team must pass through a nationwide talent search by correspondence, after which the top fifty or so are selected for a camp (usually in the December holidays) at Stellenbosch University. A number of rounds of monthly [[problem set]]s are issued by the University of Cape Town which are taken into consideration, along with the camp marks to select the top fifteen/sixteen to go to a final selection camp at Rhodes University, Grahamstown or more recently the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein in April. A final training camp takes place at the University of Cape Town or more recently, the University of Pretoria just before the IMO. The Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad has been used informally as a test, along with an IMO selection test written at the schools of the top fifteen in the event of indecision.

=== Spain ===
In [[Spain]] there are two rounds. The first one is held in each university district. There are two written tests, in which six or eight problems are to be solved, depending on the region. The first three participants in each district go to the national round. This one also consists of two written tests, three and half hours long each, with a total of six problems. The top six scorers go onto the International Olympiad.

=== Sweden ===
In [[Sweden]], a mathematics contest called "Skolornas Matematiktävling" is held every autumn. Those who qualify to the finale are invited to participate in a correspondence course in problem solving as well as the [[Nordic Mathematical Contest]]. From the combined results of the qualification round, the correspondence course and the finale and [[Nordic Mathematical Contest|NMC]], the six highest achievers of the Swedish finalists are invited to join the Swedish IMO team.

=== Taiwan ===
In [[Taiwan]], the selection process consists of three sessions, starting from April to the mid of May. Students who rank among the top 25 in the APMO can participate the first session. During each session students will be tested by six IMO-style problems, and top six students will be selected as the members of the Taiwanese IMO team. The training sessions will be held during May and June.

=== Thailand ===
In [[Thailand]], the selection of the IMO representatives is the responsibility of the organization "The Promotion of Academic Olympiad and The Development of Science Education Foundation". There are many branches of this organization around the country. At the end of August, a 30-question exam is open to all high school students to select 200 students to join a camp in each branch of the country in October for promoting mathematics skills, known in Thailand as "POSN Camp 1". The topics include Algebra, Geometry, Number Theory, Combinatorics and Inequality. After the camp, an exam is given in each of the preceding topics to evaluate the skills. A number of students, usually 50 or 100, are selected to join another camp in March, known in Thailand as "POSN Camp 2". The topics include Algebra, Geometry, Number Theory and Combinatorics in an advanced level, and Functional Equation. After the camp, an exam is given and 18 students are selected from each branch of the country to compete in the Thailand Mathematical Olympiad. Anyone with gold medal will continue to the camp known as "IPST Camp 1", and an exam is given, and some are selected to "IPST Camp 2", finally, only 6 students will compete in the International Mathematical Olympiad.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], selection is through competitions and training camps under the auspices of the [[United Kingdom Mathematics Trust]], starting with the multiple-choice [[Senior Mathematical Challenge]] (SMC).  The SMC is followed by the [[British Mathematical Olympiad]] (BMO), held in two rounds, but candidates who did not take part in the SMC or did not achieve the qualifying score may enter the BMO on payment of an entry fee and so be considered for the IMO team.  After the two rounds of the BMO, 20 potential team members, chosen primarily based on BMO results, are invited to a training and selection camp held in [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], during which further examinations are held, allowing the number of potential team members to be reduced to eight or nine. A final camp is subsequently held at [[Oundle School]], after which six students are chosen as the team and the remaining two or three as reserves.  In addition to this formal selection process, there is further training during the year for a squad of potential team members, including the 'Advanced Mentoring Scheme', practice exams and an annual training camp in [[Hungary]]; information from exams at the Hungary camp may be considered in selection where available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmoc.maths.org/home/bmo.shtml |title=The British Mathematical Olympiads |accessdate=2010-09-12 |author=BMOS/BMOC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmoc.maths.org/home/training.shtml |title=Olympiad Training |accessdate=2010-09-12 |author=BMOS/BMOC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], the team is selected through the [[American Mathematics Competitions]], which are open to all high school students. Top scorers on the [[USAMO]] go to a [[Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program|training camp]], where the top 25 or so (the number varies from 18 to almost 30) non-seniors from the result of a TST are tested over the course of the year with the [[APMO]], RMM, USA TST, and next year's USAMO.(ELMO and TSTST in June and July are also two measurements)

=== Vietnam ===
[[Vietnam]] has very extensive system of selecting and training participants for IMO. Different aspects of solving mathematical problems are studied and revealed: combinatorics, logics, structural arrangement and proofs. The first official rounds are: School (''Trường''), District (''Quận''), Province (''Tỉnh'') or Municipality (''Thành phố trực thuộc trung ương''), and National (''Quốc gia''). For some schools, the Province Round is equal to their School round. The National Round is often called the [[Vietnam Mathematical Olympiad]] (VMO). After VMO, the top 40 scorers will participate in the last round, the Vietnam Team Selection Test, or Vietnam TST. 6 students with the highest scores on Vietnam TST will be the 6 competitors for IMO.

=== Tunisia ===
There are two math associations: ATCCM (Association Tunisienne de Culture et Competitions Mathematique) and ATSM(Association Tunisienne des Sciences Mathematiques) . Each one has its own tests and have the right to choose 3 competitors for IMO.

'''Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɑːr|t|r|ə}}, {{small|US also}} {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɑːr|t}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sartre "Sartre"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|saʁtʁ|lang}}; 21 June 1905 – 15 April 1980) was a French philosopher, playwright, novelist, political activist, biographer, and [[literary criticism|literary critic]]. He was one of the key figures in the philosophy of [[existentialist|existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and one of the leading figures in [[Twentieth-Century French Philosophy|20th-century French philosophy]] and [[Marxism]]. His work has also influenced [[sociology]], [[critical theory]], [[post-colonial theory]], and [[literary studies]], and continues to influence these disciplines.

Sartre was also noted for his [[open relationship]] with prominent feminist and fellow existentialist philosopher and writer [[Simone de Beauvoir]]. Together, Sartre and de Beauvoir challenged the [[culture|cultural]] and [[society|social]] assumptions and expectations of their upbringings, which they considered [[bourgeois]], in both lifestyle and thought. The conflict between oppressive, spiritually destructive [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]] (''mauvaise foi'', literally, "[[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]") and an "[[authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]]" way of "[[being]]" became the dominant theme of Sartre's early work, a theme embodied in his principal philosophical work ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (''L'Être et le Néant'', 1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCloskey |first=Deirdre N.  |title=The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce |year=2006 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-55663-8 |page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre's introduction to his philosophy is his work ''[[Existentialism Is a Humanism]]'' (''L'existentialisme est un humanisme'', 1946), originally presented as a lecture.

He was awarded the 1964 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] despite attempting to refuse it, saying that he always declined official honours and that "a writer should not allow himself to be turned into an institution".&lt;ref&gt;The Nobel Foundation (1964).

==Biography==

===Early life===

Jean-Paul Sartre was born on 21 June 1905 in [[Paris]] as the only child of Jean-Baptiste Sartre, an officer of the [[French Navy]], and Anne-Marie (Schweitzer).&lt;ref name="Baird1999"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Forrest E. Baird|title=Twentieth Century Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E5IbAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 December 2011|date=22 July 1999|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-021534-5|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was of [[Alsace|Alsatian]] origin and the first cousin of Nobel Prize laureate [[Albert Schweitzer]], whose father Louis Théophile was the younger brother of Anne-Marie's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roglo.eu/roglo?lang=en&amp;m=NG&amp;n=Louis+Th%C3%A9ophile+Schweitzer&amp;t=PN |title=Louis Théophile Schweitzer |publisher=Roglo.eu |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When Sartre was two years old, his father died of an illness, which he most likely contracted in [[Indochina]]. Anne-Marie moved back to her parents' house in [[Meudon]], where she raised Sartre with help from her father Charles Schweitzer, a teacher of German who taught Sartre mathematics and introduced him to [[classics|classical literature]] at a very early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brabazon |first=James |title=Albert Schweitzer: A Biography |year=1975 |publisher=Putnam |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was twelve, Sartre's mother remarried, and the family moved to [[La Rochelle]], where he was frequently bullied.&lt;ref&gt;''Jean-Paul Sartre'', by Andrew N. Leak, (London 2006), page 16-18&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager in the 1920s, Sartre became attracted to philosophy upon reading [[Henri Bergson]]'s [[essay]] ''[[Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jean-Paul |first1=Sartre |author2=Arlette Elkaïm-Sartre, Jonathan Webber |title=The Imaginary: A Phenomenological Psychology of the Imagination |origyear=1940 |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-28755-3 |pages=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Cours Hattemer]], a private school in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref={{harvid|Quelques Anciens Celebres – Hattemar}} |url=http://www.hattemer.fr/fr/l-ecole/association-des-anciens-eleves/# |title=Quelques Anciens Celebres |publisher=Hattemer |accessdate=2015-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618133955/http://www.hattemer.fr/fr/l-ecole/association-des-anciens-eleves/ |archivedate=18 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied and earned certificates in psychology, history of philosophy, logic, general philosophy, ethics and sociology, and physics, as well as his ''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) in Paris at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], an institution of higher education that was the alma mater for several prominent French thinkers and intellectuals.&lt;ref name="Schrift"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schrift |first=Alan D. |editor= |others= |title=Twentieth-century French Philosophy: Key Themes and Thinkers |airdate= |origyear= |month= |url= |edition= |series= |year=2006 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=1-4051-3217-5 |pages=174–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (His 1928 MA thesis under the title "L'Image dans la vie psychologique: rôle et nature" ["Image in Psychological Life: Role and Nature"] was supervised by [[Henri Delacroix]].)&lt;ref name="Schrift"/&gt; It was at ENS that Sartre began his lifelong, sometimes fractious, friendship with [[Raymond Aron]].&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs: fifty years of political reflection'', By Raymond Aron (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most decisive influence on Sartre's philosophical development was his weekly attendance at [[Alexandre Kojève]]'s seminars, which continued for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;Auffret, D. (2002), Alexandre Kojeve. La philosophie, l'Etat, la fin de l'histoire, Paris: B. Grasset&lt;/ref&gt;

From his first years in the [[École Normale Supérieure|École Normale]], Sartre was one of its fiercest [[prank]]sters.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Boulé (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wlukeHj_TKEC&amp;pg=PA53 ''Sartre, self-formation, and masculinities''], p.,53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen-Solal1988p61"&gt;[[Annie Cohen-Solal|Cohen-Solal, Annie]] (1988), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vWbWlhHG-PEC ''Sartre: A Life''], pp. 61–2 quote: "During his first years at the Ecole, Sartre was the fearsome instigator of all the revues, all the jokes, all the scandals."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, his [[antimilitarist]] [[satirical]] cartoon in the revue of the school, coauthored with [[Georges Canguilhem]], particularly upset the director [[Gustave Lanson]].&lt;ref name="Gerassi89p76"&gt;John Gerassi (1989), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XStvJEokm7gC&amp;pg=PA76 ''Jean-Paul Sartre: Protestant or protester?''], pp. 76–7&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, with his comrades Nizan, Larroutis, Baillou and Herland,&lt;ref&gt;Godo, Emmanuel (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oT9lAAAAMAAJ ''Sartre en diable''], p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; he organized a [[media prank]] following [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s successful New York City–Paris flight; Sartre &amp; Co. called newspapers and informed them that Lindbergh was going to be awarded an honorary École degree. Many newspapers, including ''[[Le Petit Parisien]],'' announced the event on 25 May. Thousands, including journalists and curious spectators, showed up, unaware that what they were witnessing was a stunt involving a Lindbergh [[look-alike]].&lt;ref name="Gerassi89p76"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, Ronald (1987), [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCpBAQAAIAAJ ''Sartre: a life''], pp.69, 318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tameri.com/csw/exist/sartre.shtml |title=Jeanj.m.m.,n,mnn-Paul Sartre – philosopher, social advocate |publisher=Tameri.com |accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public's resultant outcry{{Request quotation|date=May 2011}} forced Lanson to resign.&lt;ref name="Gerassi89p76"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yuL98MtZ5poC&amp;pg=PA26 ''Sartre'' by David Drake, 2005], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 at the École Normale, he met [[Simone de Beauvoir]], who studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and later went on to become a noted philosopher, writer, and feminist. The two became inseparable and lifelong companions, initiating a romantic relationship,&lt;ref name="seattletimes.nwsource.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Clark |last=Humphrey |title=The People Magazine approach to a literary supercouple |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=20 November 2007 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2002648627_teteatete28.html |date=28 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231192609/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2002648627_teteatete28.html |archivedate=31 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though they were not [[Monogamy|monogamous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Siegel |first=Liliane  |title=In the shadow of Sartre |year=1990 |publisher=Collins (London) |isbn=0-00-215336-X |page=182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first time Sartre took the [[agrégation]], he failed.  He took it a second time and virtually tied for first place with Beauvoir, although Sartre was eventually awarded first place, with Beauvoir second.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Desan, ''The Tragic Finale: An Essay on the Philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1960) xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Bair, ''Simone de Beauvoir: A Biography'' (New York: Touchstone Book, 1990), pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre was drafted into the [[French Army]] from 1929 to 1931 and served as a meteorologist for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Fulton, ''Apostles of Sartre: Existentialism in America, 1945–1963'' (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1999) 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  He later argued in 1959 that each French person was responsible for the collective crimes during the [[Algerian War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Le Sueur |first1=James D. |author2=Pierre Bourdieu |title=Uncivil War: Intellectuals and Identity Politics During the Decolonization of Algeria |origyear=2005 |year= 2005|publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=0-8032-8028-9 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1931 until 1945, Sartre taught at various [[lycées]] of [[Le Havre]] (at the Lycée de Le Havre, the present-day {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée François-Ier (Le Havre)|fr}}, 1931–36), [[Laon]] (at the Lycée de Laon, 1936–37), and, finally, Paris (at the [[Lycée Pasteur (Neuilly-sur-Seine)|Lycée Pasteur]], 1937–39, and at the [[Lycée Condorcet]], 1941–44;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bloom]] (ed.), ''Jean-Paul Sartre'', Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; see [[#World War II|below]]).

In 1932, Sartre discovered ''[[Voyage au bout de la nuit]]'' by [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], a book that had a remarkable influence on him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simone de Beauvoir]], ''La Force de l'âge'', Gallimard, 1960, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933–34, he succeeded Raymond Aron at the [[Institut Français|Institut français d'Allemagne]] in [[Berlin]] where he studied [[Edmund Husserl]]'s phenomenological philosophy. Aron had already advised him in 1930 to read [[Emmanuel Levinas]]'s ''Théorie de l'intuition dans la phénoménologie de Husserl'' (''The Theory of Intuition in Husserl's Phenomenology'').&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, "Merleau-Ponty vivant", in ''Situations, IV: portraits'', Gallimard, 1964, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neo-Hegelianism|Neo-Hegelian]] revival led by [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Jean Hyppolite]] in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Sartre, to discover Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Tidd, ''Simone de Beauvoir'', Psychology Press, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===

It was during this period of confinement that Sartre read [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]'', later to become a major influence on his own essay on [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] [[ontology]]. Because of poor health (he claimed that his poor eyesight and [[exotropia]] affected his balance) Sartre was released in April 1941. According to other sources, he escaped after a medical visit to the ophthalmologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakewell |first=Sarah |authorlink=Sarah Bakewell |date=2016 |title=At the Existentialist Café |publisher=Chatto&amp;Windus |page=158 |isbn=9781473545328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given civilian status, he recovered his teaching position at Lycée Pasteur near Paris, settled at the Hotel Mistral. In October 1941 he was given a position at Lycée Condorcet in Paris, replacing a Jewish teacher who had been forbidden to teach by [[Statute on Jews|Vichy law]].

After coming back to Paris in May 1941, he participated in the founding of the underground group ''Socialisme et Liberté'' ("Socialism and Liberty") with other writers [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Jean-Toussaint Desanti]], [[Dominique Desanti]], Jean Kanapa, and École Normale students. In spring of 1941, Sartre suggested with "cheerful ferocity" at a meeting that the ''Socialisme et Liberté'' assassinate prominent war collaborators like [[Marcel Déat]], but de Beauvoir noted his idea was rejected as "none of us felt qualified to make bombs or hurl grenades".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=218}} The British historian [[Ian Ousby]] observed that the French always had far more hatred for collaborators than they did for the Germans, noting it was French people like Déat that Sartre wanted to assassinate rather than the military governor of France, General [[Otto von Stülpnagel]], and the popular slogan always was "Death to Laval!" rather than "Death to Hitler!".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=225}} In August Sartre and de Beauvoir went to the French Riviera seeking the support of [[André Gide]] and [[André Malraux]]. However, both Gide and Malraux were undecided, and this may have been the cause of Sartre's disappointment and discouragement. ''Socialisme et liberté'' soon dissolved and Sartre decided to write instead of being involved in active resistance. He then wrote ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', ''[[The Flies]]'', and ''[[No Exit]]'', none of which were censored by the Germans, and also contributed to both legal and illegal literary magazines.

In his essay "Paris under the Occupation", Sartre wrote about the "correct" behavior of the Germans had entrapped too many Parisians into complicity with the occupation, accepting what was unnatural as natural, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Germans did not stride, revolver in hand, through the streets. They did not force civilians to make way for them on the pavement. They would offer seats to old ladies on the Metro. They showed great fondness for children and would pat them on the cheek. They had been told to behave correctly and being well-disciplined, they tried shyly and conscientiously to do so. Some of them even displayed a naive kindness which could find no practical expression.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=54}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre noted when Wehrmacht soldiers asked Parisians politely in their German-accented French for directions, people usually felt embarrassed and ashamed as they tried their best to help out the Wehrmacht which led Sartre to remark "We could not be ''natural''".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=57-58}} French was a language widely taught in German schools and most Germans could speak at least some French. Sartre himself always found it difficult when a Wehrmacht soldier asked him for directions, usually saying he did not know where it was that the soldier wanted to go, but still felt uncomfortable as the very act of speaking to the Wehrmacht meant he had been complicit in the Occupation.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=151}} Ousby wrote: "But, in however humble a fashion, everyone still had to decide how they were going to cope with life in a fragmenting society ... So Sartre's worries ... about how to react when a German soldier stopped him in the street and asked politely for directions were not as fussily inconsequential as they might sound at first. They were emblematic of how the dilemmas of the Occupation presented themselves in daily life".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=151}} Sartre wrote the very "correctness" of the Germans caused moral corruption in many people who used the "correct" behavior of the Germans as an excuse for passivity, and the very act of simply trying to live one's day-to-day existence without challenging the occupation aided the "New Order in Europe", which depended upon the passivity of ordinary people to accomplish its goals.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=54}}

Throughout the occupation, it was German policy to plunder France and food shortages were always a major problem as the majority of food from the French countryside went to Germany.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=70}} Sartre wrote about the "languid existence" of the Parisians as people waited obsessively for the one weekly arrival of trucks bringing food from the countryside that the Germans allowed, writing about how: "Paris would grow peaked and yawn with hunger under the empty sky. Cut off from the rest of the world, fed only through the pity or some ulterior motive, the town led a purely abstract and symbolic life".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=70}} Sartre himself lived on a diet of rabbits sent to him by a friend of de Beauvior living in Anjou.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=127}} The rabbits were usually in an advanced state of decay full of maggots, and despite being hungry, Sartre once threw out one rabbit as uneatable, saying it had more maggots in it than meat.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=127}} Sartre also remarked on conversations at the [[Café de Flore]] between intellectuals had changed, as the fear that one of them might be a ''[[wiktionary:mouche|mouche]]'' (informer) or a writer of the ''[[wiktionary:corbeau|corbeau]]'' (anonymous denunciatory letters) meant that no-one really said what they meant anymore, imposing self-censorship.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=148}} Sartre and his friends at the Café de Flore had reasons for their fear; by September 1940, the ''Abwehr'' alone had already recruited 32,000 French people to work as ''mouches'' while by 1942 the Paris ''Kommandantur'' was receiving an average of 1,500 letters/per day sent by the ''corbeaux''.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=146}}

Sartre wrote under the occupation Paris had become a "sham", resembling the empty wine bottles displayed in shop windows as all of the wine had been exported to Germany, looking like the old Paris, but hollowed out, as what had made Paris special was gone.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=161}} Paris had almost no cars on the streets during the occupation as the oil went to Germany while the Germans imposed a nightly curfew, which led Sartre to remark that Paris "was peopled by the absent".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=172}} Sartre also noted that people began to disappear under the occupation writing about how:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One day you might phone a friend and the phone would ring for a long time in an empty flat. You would go round and ring the doorbell, but no-one would answer it. If the ''concierge'' forced the door, you would find two chairs standing close together in the hall with the fag-ends of German cigarettes on the floor between their legs. If the wife or mother of the man who had vanished had been present at his arrest, she would tell you that he had been taken away by very polite Germans, like those who asked the way in the street. And when she went to ask what had happened to them at the offices in the Avenue Foch or the Rue des Saussaies she would be politely received and sent away with comforting words" [No. 11 Rue des Saussaies was the headquarters of the Gestapo in Paris].{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=173}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre wrote the ''feldgrau'' ("field grey") uniforms of the Wehrmacht and the green uniforms of the Order Police which had seemed so alien in 1940 had become accepted, as people were numbed into accepting what Sartre called "a pale, dull green, unobtrusive strain, which the eye almost expected to find among the dark clothes of the civilians".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=170}} Under the occupation, the French often called the Germans ''les autres'' ("the others"), which inspired Sartre's aphorism in his play ''Huis clos'' ("No Exit") of "''l'enfer, c'est les Autres''" ("Hell is other people").{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=168}} Sartre intended the line  "''l'enfer, c'est les Autres''" at least in part to be a dig at the German occupiers.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=168}}

After August 1944 and the [[Liberation of Paris]], he wrote ''[[Anti-Semite and Jew]]''. In the book he tries to explain the [[etiology]] of "hate" by analyzing [[antisemitic|antisemitic hate]]. Sartre was a very active contributor to ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', a newspaper created during the clandestine period by [[Albert Camus]], a philosopher and author who held similar beliefs. Sartre and de Beauvoir remained friends with Camus until 1951, with the publication of Camus's ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]''. Later, while Sartre was labeled by some authors as a resistant, the French philosopher and resistant [[Vladimir Jankelevitch]] criticized Sartre's lack of political commitment during the German occupation, and interpreted his further struggles for liberty as an attempt to redeem himself. According to Camus, Sartre was a writer who resisted; not a resister who wrote.

In 1945, after the war ended, Sartre moved to an apartment on the [[rue Bonaparte]] which was where he was to produce most of his subsequent work, and where he lived until 1962. It was from there that he helped establish a quarterly literary and political [[review]], ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'' (''Modern Times''), in part to popularize his thought.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Fulton, Apostles of Sartre: Existentialism in America, 1945–1963 (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1999) 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  He ceased teaching and devoted his time to writing and political activism. He would draw on his war experiences for his great trilogy of novels, ''Les Chemins de la Liberté'' (''[[The Roads to Freedom]]'') (1945–1949).

===Cold War politics and anticolonialism===
[[File:Beauvoir Sartre - Che Guevara -1960 - Cuba.jpg|thumb|Jean-Paul Sartre (middle) and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (left) meeting with [[Che Guevara]] (right) in Cuba, 1960]]
The first period of Sartre's career, defined in large part by ''Being and Nothingness'' (1943), gave way to a second period—when the world was perceived as split into communist and capitalist blocs—of highly publicized political involvement. Sartre tended to glorify the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] after the war as the uncompromising expression of morality in action, and recalled that the ''résistants'' were a "band of brothers" who had enjoyed "real freedom" in a way that did not exist before nor after the war.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}} Sartre was "merciless" in attacking anyone who had collaborated or remained passive during the German occupation; for instance, criticizing Camus for signing an appeal to spare the collaborationist writer [[Robert Brasillach]] from being executed.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}} His 1948 play ''Les mains sales'' (''[[Dirty Hands]]'') in particular explored the problem of being a politically "engaged"  intellectual. He embraced [[Marxism]] but did not join the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]. For a time in the late 1940s, Sartre described French nationalism as "provincial" and in a 1949 essay called for a "United States of Europe".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=29}} In an essay published in the June 1949 edition of the journal ''Politique étrangère'', Sartre wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;If we want French civilization to survive, it must be fitted into the framework of a great European civilization. Why? I have said that civilization is the reflection on a shared situation. In Italy, in France, in Benelux, in Sweden, in Norway, in Germany, in Greece, in Austria, everywhere we find the same problems and the same dangers ... But this cultural polity has prospects only as elements of a policy which defends Europe's cultural autonomy vis-à-vis America and the Soviet Union, but also its political and economic autonomy, with the aim of making Europe a single force between the blocs, not a third bloc, but an autonomous force which will refuse to allow itself to be torn into shreds between American optimism and Russian scientificism.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=29-30}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About the Korean War, Sartre wrote: "I have no doubt that the South Korean feudalists and the American imperialists have promoted this war. But I do not doubt either that it was begun by the North Koreans".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=34}} In July 1950, Sartre wrote in ''Les Temps Modernes'' about his and de Beauvoir's attitude to the Soviet Union:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As we were neither members of the [Communist] party nor its avowed sympathizers, it was not our duty to write about Soviet labor camps; we were free to remain aloof from the quarrel over the nature of this system, provided that no events of sociological significance had occurred.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=25}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre held that the Soviet Union was a "revolutionary" state working for the betterment of humanity and could be criticized only for failing to live up to its own ideals, but that critics had to take in mind that the Soviet state needed to defend itself against a hostile world; by contrast Sartre held that the failures of "bourgeois" states were due to their innate shortcomings.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}} The Swiss journalist [[François Bondy]] wrote that, based on a reading of Sartre's numerous essays, speeches and interviews "a simple basic pattern never fails to emerge: social change must be comprehensive and revolutionary" and the parties that promote the revolutionary charges "may be criticized, but only by those who completely identify themselves with its purpose, its struggle and its road to power", deeming Sartre's position to be "existentialist".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}}

While a Marxist, Sartre attacked what he saw as abuses of freedom and human rights by the Soviet Union. In 1954, Sartre visited the Soviet Union, which he stated he found a "complete freedom of criticism" while condemning the United States for sinking into "prefascism".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=28}} Sartre wrote about those Soviet writers expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union "still had the opportunity of rehabilitating themselves by writing better books".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=41}} He was one of the first French journalists to expose the existence of the labor camps, and vehemently opposed the invasion of Hungary, Russian anti-Semitism, and the execution of dissidents. About the Hungarian revolt of 1956, Sartre wrote: "In spite of everything, the Rakosi regime stood for socialization. Only it did it badly and that is worse than not to do so at all".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=37}}  Sartre came to admire the Polish leader [[Władysław Gomułka]], a man who favored a "Polish road to socialism" and wanted more independence for Poland, but was loyal to the Soviet Union because of the Oder-Neisse line issue.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=38}} Sartre's newspaper ''Les Temps Modernes'' devoted a number of special issues in 1957 and 1958 to Poland under Gomułka, praising him for his reforms.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=38}} Bondy wrote of the notable contradiction between Sarte's "ultra Bolshevism" as he expressed admiration for the Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] as the man who lead the oppressed masses of the Third World into revolution while also praising more moderate Communist leaders like Gomułka.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=38}}

As an anti-colonialist, Sartre took a prominent role in the struggle against French rule in Algeria, and the use of torture and concentration camps by the French in Algeria. He became an eminent supporter of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] in the [[Algerian War]] and was one of the signatories of the ''[[Manifeste des 121]]''. Consequently, Sartre became a domestic target of the paramilitary [[Organisation armée secrète]] (OAS), escaping two bomb attacks in the early '60s.&lt;ref&gt;István Mészáros, ''The Work of Sartre: Search for Freedom and the Challenge of History,'' rev. ed. (New York: Monthly Review, 2012), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; (He had an Algerian mistress, Arlette Elkaïm, who became his adopted daughter in 1965.) He opposed U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] and, along with [[Bertrand Russell]] and others, organized a [[tribunal]] intended to expose U.S. [[war crimes]], which became known as the [[Russell Tribunal]] in 1967.
[[File:Jean Paul Sartre by Gray.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Sketch of Sartre for the ''New York Times'' by [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]], 1965]]

His work after Stalin's death, the ''Critique de la raison dialectique'' (''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''), appeared in 1960 (a second volume appearing posthumously). In the ''Critique'' Sartre set out to give Marxism a more vigorous intellectual defense than it had received until then; he ended by concluding that Marx's notion of "class" as an objective entity was fallacious. Sartre's emphasis on the humanist values in the early works of Marx led to a dispute with a leading leftist intellectual in France in the 1960s, [[Louis Althusser]], who claimed that the ideas of the [[young Marx]] were decisively superseded by the "scientific" system of the later Marx. In the late 1950s, Sartre began to argue that the European working classes were too apolitical to carry out the revolution predicated by Marx, and influenced by [[Frantz Fanon]] stated to argue it was the impoverished masses of the Third World, the "real damned of the earth", who would carry out the revolution.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=27-28}} A major theme of Sarte's political essays in the 1960s was of his disgust with the "Americanization" of the French working class who would much rather watch American TV shows dubbed into French than agitate for a revolution.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}}

Sartre went to [[Cuba]] in the 1960s to meet [[Fidel Castro]] and spoke with [[Ernesto "Che" Guevara]]. After Guevara's death, Sartre would declare him to be "not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=27548&amp;Cat=9&amp;dt=10/9/2006 |title="Remembering Che Guevara", 9 October 2006, '&amp;#39;The International News'&amp;#39;, by Prof Khwaja Masud |work=The News International |date=9 October 2006 |accessdate=27 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112210219/http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=27548&amp;Cat=9&amp;dt=10%2F9%2F2006 |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "era's most perfect man".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=1920888241 |title=Amazon Review of: 'The Bolivian Diary: Authorized Edition' |publisher=Amazon.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre would also compliment Guevara by professing that "he lived his words, spoke his own actions and his story and the story of the world ran parallel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heyche.org/peopleaboutche.html HeyChe.org – People about Che Guevara]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709042917/http://www.heyche.org/peopleaboutche.html |date=9 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However he stood against the persecution of gays by Castro's régime, which he compared to Nazi persecution of the Jews, and said: "In Cuba there are no Jews, but there are homosexuals".&lt;ref&gt;Conducta Impropria by [[Nestor Almendros]], 1983: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQB5cI9b4A&amp;index=8&amp;list=PLD12AFBD33DDE5D99.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a collective hunger strike in 1974, Sartre visited [[Red Army Faction]] leader [[Andreas Baader]] in [[Stammheim Prison]] and criticized the harsh conditions of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Paul Sartre |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/1974/baader.htm |title=The Slow Death of Andreas Baader |publisher=Marxists.org |date=7 December 1974 |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of his life, Sartre became an [[anarchism|anarchist]].&lt;ref name="nybooks4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1975/aug/07/sartre-at-seventy-an-interview/?page=4 |title=Sartre at Seventy: An Interview by Jean-Paul Sartre and Michel Contat |work=The New York Review of Books |date=7 August 1975 |accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raforum1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://raforum.info/spip.php?article92 |title=R.A.

In 1964 Sartre renounced literature in a witty and sardonic account of the first ten years of his life, ''Les Mots'' (''[[The Words (book)|The Words]]''). The book is an ironic counterblast to [[Marcel Proust]], whose reputation had unexpectedly eclipsed that of [[André Gide]] (who had provided the model of ''littérature engagée'' for Sartre's generation). Literature, Sartre concluded, functioned ultimately as a bourgeois substitute for real commitment in the world. In October 1964, Sartre was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] but he declined it. He was the first Nobel laureate to voluntarily decline the prize,&lt;ref&gt;

Though his name was then a household word (as was "existentialism" during the tumultuous 1960s), Sartre remained a simple man with few possessions, actively committed to causes until the end of his life, such as the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 strikes]] in Paris during the summer of 1968 during which he was arrested for [[civil disobedience]]. President [[Charles de Gaulle]] intervened and pardoned him, commenting that "you don't arrest [[Voltaire]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DF1538F934A35755C0A961948260 "Superstar of the Mind"], by Tom Bishop in ''[[The New York Times]]'' 7 June 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir grave, Montparnasse, Paris, France-16June2009.jpg|thumb|Sartre's and de Beauvoir's grave in the [[Cimetière de Montparnasse]]]]
In 1975, when asked how he would like to be remembered, Sartre replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like &lt;nowiki&gt;[people]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to remember ''Nausea'', &lt;nowiki&gt;[my plays]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''No Exit'' and ''The Devil and the Good Lord,'' and then my two philosophical works, more particularly the second one, ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''. Then my essay on [[Jean Genet|Genet]], ''Saint Genet''. ... If these are remembered, that would be quite an achievement, and I don't ask for more. As a man, if a certain Jean-Paul Sartre is remembered, I would like people to remember the milieu or historical situation in which I lived, ... how I lived in it, in terms of all the aspirations which I tried to gather up within myself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Charlesworth  |first=Max  |title=The Existentialists and Jean-Paul Sartre |year=1976 |publisher=University of Queensland Press |isbn=0-7022-1150-8 |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre's physical condition deteriorated, partially because of the merciless pace of work (and the use of [[amphetamine]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Criterion review of La Cérémonie des adieux by Simone de Beauvoir|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-last-days-of-Jean-Paul-Sartre-6523}}&lt;/ref&gt; he put himself through during the writing of the ''Critique'' and a massive analytical biography of [[Gustave Flaubert]] (''The Family Idiot''), both of which remained unfinished. He suffered from hypertension,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hayman. ''Sartre: A Biography.'' Carroll &amp; Graf, 1992, p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt; and became almost completely blind in 1973. Sartre was a notorious [[chain smoker]], which could also have contributed to the deterioration of his health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Samuel|first=Henry|title=Hell is other people removing your cigarette|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1485353/Hell-is-other-people-removing-your-cigarette.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=10 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre died on 15 April 1980 in Paris from [[edema]] of the lung. He had not wanted to be buried at [[Père-Lachaise Cemetery]] between his mother and stepfather, so it was arranged that he be buried at [[Montparnasse Cemetery]]. At his funeral on Saturday, 19 April, 50,000 Parisians descended onto Boulevard Montparnasse to accompany Sartre's cortege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Histoire Du Monde|url=http://www.histoiredumonde.net/Jean-Paul-Sartre.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat-2000-Singer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000605/singer/single |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080602061137/http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000605/singer/single |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 June 2008 |title=Sartre's Roads to Freedom |last=Singer |first=Daniel |date=5 June 2000 |work=The Nation |accessdate=9 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral started at "the hospital at 2:00 p.m., then filed through the fourteenth arrondissement, past all Sartre's haunts, and entered the cemetery through the gate on the Boulevard Edgar Quinet". Sartre was initially buried in a temporary grave to the left of the cemetery gate.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Solal, Annie. ''Sartre: A Life.'' Random House, Inc., 1987, p. 523.&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later the body was disinterred for cremation at Père-Lachaise Cemetery, and his ashes were reburied at the permanent site in Montparnasse Cemetery, to the right of the cemetery gate.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Solal, Annie, p. 523.

==Thought==
{{See also|Being and Nothingness}}
Sartre's primary idea is that people, as humans, are "condemned to be free".&lt;ref name="Existentialism and Humanism"&gt;''Existentialism and Humanism''&lt;/ref&gt; This theory relies upon his position that there is no creator, and is illustrated using the example of the [[paper cutter]]. Sartre says that if one considered a paper cutter, one would assume that the creator would have had a plan for it: an essence. Sartre said that human beings have no essence before their existence because there is no Creator. Thus: "existence precedes essence".&lt;ref name="Existentialism and Humanism"/&gt; This forms the basis for his assertion that because one cannot explain one's own actions and behavior by referring to any specific human nature, they are necessarily fully responsible for those actions. "We are left alone, without excuse." "We can act without being determined by our past which is always separated from us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8181406/Does_our_past_have_a_motivational_effect_Our_reasons_for_acting_Sartre_s_philosophy_of_action |title=Does our past have a motivational effect? Our reasons for acting: Sartre's philosophy of action. |author=[[Yoann Malinge]] |date= |website=[[Academia.edu]] |access-date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre maintained that the concepts of authenticity and individuality have to be earned but not learned. We need to experience "death consciousness" so as to wake up ourselves as to what is really important; the authentic in our lives which is life experience, not knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Being and Nothingness, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Death draws the final point when we as beings cease to live for ourselves and permanently become objects that exist only for the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Death. (1999). In Gordon Hayim (Ed.) Dictionary of Existentialism (p. 105). Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way death emphasizes the burden of our free, individual existence.

As a junior lecturer at the Lycée du [[Le Havre|Havre]] in 1938, Sartre wrote the novel ''[[Nausea (novel)|La Nausée]]'' (''Nausea''), which serves in some ways as a [[manifesto]] of [[existentialism]] and remains one of his most famous books. Taking a page from the [[Husserl|German]] [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] movement, he believed that our ideas are the product of experiences of real-life situations, and that novels and plays can well describe such fundamental experiences, having equal value to discursive essays for the elaboration of philosophical theories such as existentialism. With such purpose, this novel concerns a dejected researcher (Roquentin) in a town similar to Le Havre who becomes starkly conscious of the fact that inanimate objects and situations remain absolutely indifferent to his existence. As such, they show themselves to be resistant to whatever significance human consciousness might perceive in them.

He also took inspiration from phenomenologist epistemology, explained by Franz Adler in this way: "Man chooses and makes himself by acting. Any action implies the judgment that he is right under the circumstances not only for the actor, but also for everybody else in similar circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Social Thought of Jean-Paul Sartre | journal = American Journal of Sociology | first = Franz | last = Adler | volume = 55 | issue = 3&lt;!--|accessdate=16 May 2013--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This indifference of "things in themselves" (closely linked with the later notion of "being-in-itself" in his ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'') has the effect of highlighting all the more the freedom Roquentin has to perceive and act in the world; everywhere he looks, he finds situations imbued with meanings which bear the stamp of his existence. Hence the "nausea" referred to in the title of the book; all that he encounters in his everyday life is suffused with a pervasive, even horrible, taste—specifically, his freedom. The book takes the term from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', where it is used in the context of the often nauseating quality of existence. No matter how much Roquentin longs for something else or something different, he cannot get away from this harrowing evidence of his engagement with the world.

The novel also acts as a terrifying realization of some of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s fundamental ideas about freedom; Sartre uses the idea of the autonomy of the will (that [[morality]] is derived from our ability to choose in reality; the ability to choose being derived from human freedom; embodied in the famous saying "Condemned to be free") as a way to show the world's indifference to the individual. The freedom that Kant exposed is here a strong burden, for the freedom to act towards objects is ultimately useless, and the practical application of Kant's ideas proves to be bitterly rejected.

Also important is Sartre's analysis of psychological concepts, including his suggestion that consciousness exists as something other than itself, and that the conscious awareness of things is not limited to their knowledge: for Sartre intentionality applies to the emotions as well as to cognitions, to desires as well as to perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):50–62.&lt;/ref&gt; "When an external object is perceived, consciousness is also conscious of itself, even if consciousness is not its own object: it is a non-positional consciousness of itself."&lt;ref&gt;Yoann Malinge, ''"Sartre, « The Transcendance of the Ego »"'' (The Literary Encyclopedia: https://www.academia.edu/31648622/_Sartre_The_Transcendance_of_the_Ego_article_in_The_Literary_Encyclopedia_&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career as public intellectual==
[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|thumb|upright|Jean-Paul Sartre and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] at the [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]] Memorial]]
While the broad focus of Sartre's life revolved around the notion of human freedom, he began a sustained intellectual participation in more public matters towards the end of the Second World War, around 1944-45.&lt;ref&gt;Baert 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Before World War II, he was content with the role of an apolitical liberal intellectual: "Now teaching at a lycée in Laon ... Sartre made his headquarters the Dome café at the crossing of Montparnasse and Raspail boulevards. He attended plays, read novels, and dined &lt;nowiki&gt;[with]&lt;/nowiki&gt; women. He wrote. And he was published."&lt;ref&gt;Gerassi 1989: 134&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre and his lifelong companion, de Beauvoir, existed, in her words, where "the world about us was a mere backdrop against which our private lives were played out".&lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir 1958: 339&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre portrayed his own pre-war situation in the character Mathieu, chief protagonist in ''[[The Age of Reason (Sartre)|The Age of Reason]]'', which was completed during Sartre's first year as a soldier in the Second World War. By forging Mathieu as an absolute [[rationalist]], analyzing every situation, and functioning entirely on reason, he removed any strands of authentic content from his character and as a result, Mathieu could "recognize no allegiance except to [him]self",&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 1942: 13&lt;/ref&gt; though he realized that without "responsibility for my own existence, it would seem utterly absurd to go on existing".&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 1942: 14&lt;/ref&gt; Mathieu's commitment was only to himself, never to the outside world. Mathieu was restrained from action each time because he had no reasons for acting. Sartre then, for these reasons, was not compelled to participate in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and it took the invasion of his own country to motivate him into action and to provide a crystallization of these ideas. It was the war that gave him a purpose beyond himself, and the atrocities of the war can be seen as the turning point in his public stance.

The war opened Sartre's eyes to a political reality he had not yet understood until forced into continual engagement with it: "the world itself destroyed Sartre's illusions about isolated self-determining individuals and made clear his own personal stake in the events of the time."&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 108&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Paris in 1941 he formed the "Socialisme et Liberté" resistance group. In 1943, after the group disbanded, Sartre joined a writers' Resistance group,&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, Ronald (2004). ''Camus &amp; Sartre: The Story of a Friendship and the Quarrel That Ended It''. University of Chicago Press. p. 30. {{ISBN|0-226-02796-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-226-02796-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he remained an active participant until the end of the war. He continued to write ferociously, and it was due to this "crucial experience of war and captivity that Sartre began to try to build up a positive moral system and to express it through literature".&lt;ref&gt;Thody 1964: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolic initiation of this new phase in Sartre's work is packaged in the introduction he wrote for a new journal, ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', in October 1945. Here he aligned the journal, and thus himself, with the Left and called for writers to express their political commitment.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 10&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, this alignment was indefinite, directed more to the concept of the Left than a specific party of the Left.

Sartre's philosophy lent itself to his being a [[public intellectual]]. He envisaged culture as a very fluid concept; neither pre-determined, nor definitely finished; instead, in true [[existentialism|existential]] fashion, "culture was always conceived as a process of continual invention and re-invention." This marks Sartre, the intellectual, as a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]], willing to move and shift stance along with events. He did not dogmatically follow a cause other than the belief in [[liberty|human freedom]], preferring to retain a pacifist's objectivity. It is this overarching theme of freedom that means his work "subverts the bases for distinctions among the disciplines".&lt;ref&gt;Kirsner 2003: 13&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he was able to hold knowledge across a vast array of subjects: "the international world order, the political and economic organisation of contemporary society, especially France, the institutional and legal frameworks that regulate the lives of ordinary citizens, the educational system, the media networks that control and disseminate information. Sartre systematically refused to keep quiet about what he saw as inequalities and injustices in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1999: xii&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre always sympathized with the Left, and supported the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) until the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. Following the [[Liberation of France|Liberation]] the PCF were infuriated by Sartre's philosophy, which appeared to lure young French men and women away from the ideology of communism and into Sartre's own existentialism.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1999: 13&lt;/ref&gt; From 1956 onwards Sartre rejected the claims of the PCF to represent the French working classes, objecting to its "authoritarian tendencies". In the late 1960s Sartre supported the [[Maoism|Maoists]], a movement that rejected the authority of established communist parties.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/ |title=Jean-Paul Sartre |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite aligning with the Maoists, Sartre said after the May events: "If one rereads all my books, one will realize that I have not changed profoundly, and that I have always remained an anarchist."&lt;ref name="nybooks4"/&gt; He would later explicitly allow himself to be called an anarchist.&lt;ref name="raforum1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated21"/&gt;

In the aftermath of a war that had for the first time properly engaged Sartre in political matters, he set forth a body of work which "reflected on virtually every important theme of his early thought and began to explore alternative solutions to the problems posed there".&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 121&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest difficulties that he and all public intellectuals of the time faced were the increasing technological aspects of the world that were outdating the printed word as a form of expression. In Sartre's opinion, the "traditional bourgeois literary forms remain innately superior", but there is "a recognition that the new technological 'mass media' forms must be embraced" if Sartre's ethical and political goals as an authentic, committed intellectual are to be achieved: the demystification of [[bourgeois]] political practices and the raising of the consciousness, both political and cultural, of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1993: 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle for Sartre was against the monopolising moguls who were beginning to take over the media and destroy the role of the intellectual. His attempts to reach a public were mediated by these powers, and it was often these powers he had to campaign against. He was skilled enough, however, to circumvent some of these issues by his interactive approach to the various forms of media, advertising his radio interviews in a newspaper column for example, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1993: 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of a public intellectual can lead to the individual placing himself in danger as he engages with disputed topics. In Sartre's case, this was witnessed in June 1961, when a plastic bomb exploded in the entrance of his apartment building. His public support of Algerian [[self-determination]] at the time had led Sartre to become a target of the campaign of terror that mounted as the colonists' position deteriorated. A similar occurrence took place the next year and he had begun to receive threatening letters from [[Oran|Oran, Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
Sartre wrote successfully in a number of literary modes and made major contributions to literary criticism and literary biography. His plays are richly symbolic and serve as a means of conveying his philosophy. The best-known, ''Huis-clos'' (''[[No Exit]]''), contains the famous line "L'enfer, c'est les autres", usually translated as "Hell is other people."&lt;ref name="rickontheater"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rickontheater.blogspot.com/2010/07/most-famous-thing-jean-paul-sartre.html |title= The Most Famous Thing Jean-Paul Sartre Never Said |last1=Woodward |first1=Kirk|date=9 July 2010 |work=Rick on Theater |publisher=Blogger (Google: blogspot.com) |accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the impact of ''Nausea'', Sartre's major work of fiction was ''[[The Roads to Freedom]]'' trilogy which charts the progression of how World War II affected Sartre's ideas. In this way, ''Roads to Freedom'' presents a less theoretical and more practical approach to [[existentialism]].

[[John Huston]] got Sartre to script his film ''[[Freud: The Secret Passion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, ''Le Scénario'', 10; Scenario. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; However it was too long and Sartre withdrew his name from the film's credits.&lt;ref name="Roudinesco"&gt;Roudinesco, Elisabeth. ''Jacques Lacan &amp; Co: A History of Psychoanalysis in France, 1925–1985''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many key elements from Sartre's script survive in the finished film.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asharperfocus.com/Freud.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite their similarities as polemicists, novelists, adapters, and playwrights, Sartre's literary work has been counterposed, often pejoratively, to that of Camus in the popular imagination. In 1948 the [[Roman Catholic Church]] placed Sartre's oeuvre on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' (List of Prohibited Books)]].

==Criticism==
Some philosophers argue that Sartre's thought is contradictory. Specifically, they believe that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claim that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics. [[Herbert Marcuse]] criticized ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: "Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it [[Reification (fallacy)|hypostatizes]] specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory."&lt;ref&gt;Marcuse, Herbert. "Sartre's Existentialism". Printed in ''Studies in Critical Philosophy''. Translated by Joris De Bres. London: NLB, 1972. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Letter on Humanism]]'', Heidegger criticized Sartre's existentialism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Existentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking ''existentia'' and ''essentia'' according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that ''essentia'' precedes ''existentia''. Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it, he stays with metaphysics, in oblivion of the truth of Being.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, "Letter on Humanism", in ''Basic Writings: Nine Key Essays, plus the Introduction to ''Being and Time'' '', trans. David Farrell Krell (London, Routledge; 1978), 208. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kVc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA208 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The philosophers [[Richard Wollheim]] and [[Thomas Baldwin (philosopher)|Thomas Baldwin]] have argued that Sartre's attempt to show that [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of the unconscious is mistaken was based on a misinterpretation of Freud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas Baldwin |editor=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=792 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim, Richard. ''Freud''. London, Fontana Press, pp. 157–176&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]] considers Sartre one of many modern thinkers who have reconstructed Judaeo-Christian orthodoxies in secular form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |page=7 |isbn=0-9515922-5-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectuals associated with the political [[Right-wing politics|right]] allege that Sartre's politics are indicative of [[authoritarianism]]. [[Brian C. Anderson]] denounced Sartre as an apologist for tyranny and terror and a supporter of [[Stalinism]], [[Maoism]], and Castro's regime in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; The historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] asserted that Sartre's ideas had inspired the [[Khmer Rouge]] leadership:  "The events in Cambodia in the 1970s, in which between one-fifth and one-third of the nation was starved to death or murdered, were entirely the work of a group of intellectuals, who were for the most part pupils and admirers of Jean-Paul Sartre – 'Sartre's Children' as I call them."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul, "[http://www.fortfreedom.org/h11.htm The Heartless Lovers of Humankind]", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 5 January 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre, who stated in his preface to [[Frantz Fanon]]'s ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' that, "To shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone, to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at the same time: there remains a dead man and a free man," has been criticized by Anderson and [[Michael Walzer]] for supporting the killing of European civilians by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] during the [[Algerian War]]. Walzer suggests that Sartre, a European, was a hypocrite for not volunteering to be killed.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;[http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/6476 The Absolute Intellectual] Brian C. Anderson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=598 Can There Be a Decent Left?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118221640/http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=598 |date=18 November 2011 }} {{website=Kenyon.edu |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Politics/Waltzer.htm |date=18 November 2011 }} Michael Walzer&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic, poet, essayist and philosopher [[Clive James]] excoriated Sartre in his book of mini biographies ''[[Cultural Amnesia (book)|Cultural Amnesia]]'' (2007). James attacks Sartre's philosophy as being "all a pose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/clives_lives/2007/03/jeanpaul_sartre.html|title=Jean-Paul Sartre|first=Clive|last=James|date=29 March 2007|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2016|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joan Crowfoot Payne''' (16 January 1912 – 4 October 2002) was a British archaeologist specialising in the study of [[Lithic analysis|lithics]] (stone tools and chipped stone) from the [[Ancient Near East]] and worked as Cataloguer of the [[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian]] collection at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in Oxford.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.griffith.ox.ac.uk/index.php/payne-joan-crowfoot|title=Payne, Joan Crowfoot – Griffith Institute Archive|website=archive.griffith.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who Was Who in Egyptology (4th revised edn)|last=Bierbrier|first=M.L.|publisher=The Egypt Exploration Society|year=2012|isbn=9780856982071|location=London|pages=419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Joan Crowfoot Payne was born in Giza, Egypt, in 1912 to the archaeologists [[John Winter Crowfoot]] (1873-1959) and [[Grace Mary Crowfoot]] (1877-1957).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moorey|first=Roger|date=2003|title=Joan Crowfoot Payne (1912–2002)|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1179/lev.2003.35.1.iv|journal=Levant|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=iv–v|doi=10.1179/lev.2003.35.1.iv|issn=0075-8914|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her older sister was Nobel prize winning chemist [[Dorothy Hodgkin]]. From 1929-1932 she attended the [[London School of Medicine for Women]] but was unable to complete her medical training due to an eye condition; from 1932–3 she attended the [[University of Cambridge]] as a Research Student on the Diploma Course in [[Archaeology]], although her lack of knowledge of Latin meant she could not sit the qualifying exam for the course.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Career ==
Payne participated in archaeological excavations in the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Iraq]] as an expert in the study of [[Lithic analysis|lithics]] (chipped stone), working with archaeologists including her father [[John Winter Crowfoot]], [[Dorothy Garrod]], [[John Garstang]], [[Mortimer Wheeler]], and [[Kathleen Kenyon]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1957 she was appointed to the post of Cataloguer in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in Oxford, with responsibility for cataloguing the Egyptian and Nubian collections, resulting in her 1993 publication of the ''Catalogue of the Predynastic Egyptian Collection in the Ashmolean Museum''; she was also involved in creating displays of lithic material in the Egyptian and Near Eastern galleries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Payne collaborated with [[Elise Jenny Baumgartel]] on the publication of [[Flinders Petrie]]'s excavations at [[Naqada]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; publishing an update to Baumgartel's ''Petrie's Naqada Excavations: A supplement'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Payne|first=Joan Crowfoot|date=1987-08-01|title=Appendix to Naqada Excavations Supplement|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/030751338707300114|journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology|language=en|volume=73|issue=1|pages=181–189|doi=10.1177/030751338707300114|issn=0307-5133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 she was promoted to a Departmental Assistantship at the Ashmolean.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7807">The [[anti-trust]] [[class-action]] lawsuit '''Jung v. AAMC ''' alleged collusion to prevent American [[medical resident|trainee doctors]] from negotiating for better working conditions. The [[Medical resident work hours|working conditions of medical residents]] often involved 80- to 100-hour workweeks.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527031017/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html |date=May 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit had some early success, but failed when the U.S. Congress enacted a statute exempting matching programs from federal anti-trust laws.

==Background==
Every year, American medical students and graduates participate along with foreign-trained physicians in a national matching plan to obtain a position in an accredited resident training program.  Applicants and programs that participate in the matching plan submit rank-ordered preferences for training.  A mathematical algorithm is used to place an applicant in a preferred program that also prefers the applicant.

The [[National Resident Matching Program]], also referred to as "The Match", is one of several national matching plans in the United States.

==Lawsuit==
The suit was launched on behalf of all current and former medical residents against defendants that oversaw and participated in the matching process as well as institutions that employed medical residents.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1001/virtualmentor.2015.17.2.hlaw1-1502| volume = 17| issue = 2| pages = 149| last = Weinmeyer| first = Richard| title = Challenging the Medical Residency Matching System through Antitrust Litigation| journal = Virtual Mentor| accessdate = 2016-05-06| date = 2015-02-01| url = http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150205045900/http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| archivedate = 2015-02-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three physicians who launched the suit alleged that the [[National Resident Matching Program|NRMP Matching program]] was an [[anti-competitive practice]], claiming that:

* fourth-year medical students were required to apply to the Match, and had no opportunity to negotiate their terms of employment with teaching hospitals ''(if they did not apply, they could not enter a residency accredited by the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]], and hence could not become certified as physicians by an [[American Board of Medical Specialties|ABMS-recognized board]], meaning that they cannot practice their specialty)''
* the defendants limited the number of residency positions available in U.S. teaching hospitals 
* the defendants placed "substantial obstacles to the ability of a resident to transfer employment from one employer to another during the period of a residency"
* the ACGME encouraged or required participation in the Match as a condition of accreditation for institutions offering residencies.
* the defendants shared information on conditions of employment, and reviewed them in order to keep salaries low.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;[http://www.law.uh.edu/healthlaw/perspectives/%28MT%29Jung3.pdf Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges: A Special Interest Victory], Miranda W. Turner, University of Houston Law Center,November 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendants challenged the admissibility of the lawsuit with several arguments, including a lack of jurisdiction &lt;ref name=opinion&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/2004419300FSupp2d119_1407/JUNG%20v.%20ASSOCIATION%20OF%20AMERICAN%20MEDICAL%20COLLEGES]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the plaintiffs had not been injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S1546-1440(03)00007-3| issn = 1546-1440| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 40–47| last = Bierig| first = Jack R.| title = Jung v. Association Of American Medical Colleges: the lawsuit challenging our system of graduate medical education| journal = Journal of the American College of Radiology| accessdate = 2016-05-06| date = 2004-01-01| url = http://www.jacr.org/article/S1546144003000073/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court dismissed the cases against two defendants for lack of jurisdiction, and three because the claims of conspiracy did not involve them. The federal district court did allow the case to proceed against 17 defendants, ruling:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the Court finds that plaintiffs adequately have alleged a common agreement to displace competition in the recruitment, hiring, employment and compensation of resident physicians and to impose a scheme of restraints that has the purpose and effect of fixing, artificially depressing, standardizing and stabilizing resident physician compensation and other terms of employment among certain defendants.&lt;ref name=opinion/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legislative change==
The lawsuit ended when Congress enacted legislation as a [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] added to an unrelated bill (the [[Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004|Pension Funding Equity Act]]) that exempted participation in a matching program from federal anti-trust laws.

The rider was called "Confirmation of antitrust status of graduate medical resident matching programs" (Section 207). Neither the rider nor the then-ongoing Jung v. AAMC case was debated. The rider was lobbied for by the [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]] and the [[American Hospital Association]], and sponsored by Senator [[Judd Gregg]] of New Hampshire and Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] of Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt; Senators [[Herb Kohl|Kohl]], [[Russ Feingold|Feingold]], and [[Jeff Bingaman|Bingaman]] publicly criticized the way in which the rider was added.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt;

The rider praised the 50-year-old Matching Program, saying that "[a]ntitrust lawsuits challenging the matching process, regardless of their merit or lack thereof, have the potential to undermine this highly efficient, pro-competitive, and long standing process" and  "would divert the scarce resources of our country's teaching hospitals and medical schools from their crucial missions of patient care, physician training, and medical research"&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt;

The bill containing the rider was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on April 8, 2004.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt;

The new law prohibited  "using allegations related to the Match to support any antitrust claim",&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt; retroactively.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt; The court ruled that the plaintiff's case was dependent on allegations related to the Match.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt; The case was dismissed under the authority of the new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/14/us/antitrust-lawsuit-over-medical-residency-system-is-dismissed.html |first=S. |last=Robinson |title=Antitrust Lawsuit Over Medical Residency System Is Dismissed |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=August 14, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lawrence F.''' "'''Larry'''" '''McCaffery Jr.''' (born May 13, 1946) is an America [[literary critic]], [[editing|editor]], and retired [[professor]] of [[English language|English]] and [[Comparative Literature]] at [[San Diego State University]]. His work and teaching focuses on [[postmodern literature]], contemporary [[fiction]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]].&lt;ref&gt;McCaffery on Glory Days: A Bruce Springsteen Symposium ({{cite web |url=http://app.outreach.psu.edu/springsteen/schedule/AbstractList.asp?TT=58 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720032825/http://app.outreach.psu.edu/springsteen/schedule/AbstractList.asp?TT=58 |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }})&lt;/ref&gt; He also played a role in helping to establish [[science fiction]] as a major literary genre.&lt;ref&gt;See McCaffery's chapter "The Fictions of the Present." ''The Columbia Literary History of the United States, ed. Emory Eliiott. New York: Columbia University Press, 1988, pp. 116–77. ({{ISBN|978-0-231-05812-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
McCaffery was born in 1946 in [[Dallas, Texas]]. He received his PhD in 1975, with a dissertation on the works of [[Robert Coover]].&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt;  He joined the Department of English and Comparative Literature at  [[San Diego State University]] in 1976. He taught in SDSU's English Department until retiring in 2010.  During his career as a professor, McCaffery took up visiting professorships at [[University of Nice]], [[University of California, San Diego]], [[Deep Springs College]] (where [[William T. Vollmann]] attended), [[Seikei University]] in [[Tokyo, Japan]] and was a Fulbright Lecturer at [[Beijing Foreign Studies University]] during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].  He and his wife currently reside in Borrego Springs, California.

==Literary career==
In 1983, McCaffery published two books in the field of postmodern literary studies.  The first was ''The Metafictional Muse: The Works of Coover, Gass, and Barthelme'', which explored the emergence of the "meta-impulse" as one of the defining features of postmodern aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;''The Metafictional Muse: The Work of Robert Coover, Donald Barthelme and William H. Gass''. Pittsburgh: Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1982. ({{ISBN|978-0-8229-3462-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;  The second was ''Anything Can Happen: Interviews with Contemporary American Novelists'' (with [[Tom LeClair]]), which helped identify the major innovative authors associated with [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;'Anything Can Happen: Interviews with Contemporary American Novelists'' (with [[Tom LeClair]]). Urbana: [[University of Illinois Press]], 1983. ({{ISBN|978-0-252-00971-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;

McCaffery went on to publish three additional collections of interviews with contemporary authors: ''Alive and Writing: Interviews with American Authors of the 1980s'' with Sinda Gregory (1986),&lt;ref&gt;''Alive and Writing: Interviews with American Authors of the 1980s'' (with Sinda Gregory). Urbana: [[University of Illinois Press]], 1987. ({{ISBN|978-0-252-01385-0}})&lt;/ref&gt; ''Across the Wounded Galaxies: Interviews with Contemporary American Science Fiction Authors'' (1990),&lt;ref&gt;''Across the Wounded Galaxies: Interviews with Contemporary American Science Fiction Authors''. Urbana: [[University of Illinois Press]] 1990. ({{ISBN|978-0-252-06140-0}})&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Some Other Frequency: Interviews with Innovative American Authors'' (1995).&lt;ref name="SOF"&gt;''Some Other Frequency: Interviews with Innovative American Authors''. Philadelphia, PA: [[University of Pennsylvania Press|Univ. of Pennsylvania Press]], 1995. ({{ISBN|978-0-8122-3201-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; McCaffery explains that the interviews within these works begin orally, and, after being transcribed from tape and edited by both McCaffery and the interviewee, become "collaborative texts based on an actual conversation rather than a direct rendering of that conversation".&lt;ref name="SOF" /&gt;  These  works established  "avant-prof" critic [[Lance Olsen]] to dub McCaffery as "Guru of the Interview"&lt;ref&gt;"Guru of the Interview": Lance Olsen reviews ''Across the Wounded Galaxies'' In ''American Book Review'' August/September 1990, p. 1 (http://americanbookreview.org/issueContent.asp?id=97)&lt;/ref&gt;

During his career as Professor at SDSU, McCaffery played a large role as editor of literary journals.  In 1983, McCaffery arranged to have the literary journal, [[Fiction International]] move to SDSU from [[New York City]], where it had been edited and published by [[Joe David Bellamy]] since 1973.&lt;ref name="FI"&gt;http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~fictintl/about.php&lt;/ref&gt;  McCaffery served as co-editor of [[Fiction International|FI]] with Harold Jaffe for the next decade, during which it became one of the leading publishers of radically innovative, politically charged fiction.&lt;ref name="FI" /&gt; Since the early eighties, he has also been an editor of [http://americanbookreview.org/ American Book Review], and executive editor of [http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/journal.asp?issn=0011-1619&amp;linktype=145 Critique: Studies in Contemporary Fiction].  McCaffery has guest-edited several special issues of other literary magazines, including [[Mississippi Review]]'s landmark "Cyberpunk Issue''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mississippi Review'': The Cyberpunk Controversy. #47/48.  1988.  Including general introduction, "The Desert of the Real: The Cyberpunk Controversy."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyberpunk Timeline (http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/timeline.html)&lt;/ref&gt;

His work ''[[Storming the Reality Studio]]'' placed  [[science fiction]] and [[cyberpunk]] within the field of [[postmodern]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Dudley review from ''[[Science Fiction Studies]]'' 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; an anthology featuring the fictional work of authors such as [[William Gibson]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], [[Don DeLillo]], [[Kathy Acker]], and [[Harold Jaffe]], as well as non-fiction by writers such as [[Jean Baudrillard]] and [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref&gt;McCaffery, Larry, Ed. ''Storming the Reality Studio'' Durham: Duke University Press, 1991. ({{ISBN|978-0-8223-1168-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable anthologies are ''[[Avant-Pop: Fiction for a Daydream Nation]]'' (1993) and ''After Yesterday's Crash: The Avant-Pop Anthology'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;''After Yesterday's Crash: The Avant-Pop Anthology''. NY: [[Penguin Books]], 1997. ({{ISBN|978-0-14-024085-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in pop culture and legacy==
McCaffery is briefly mentioned in [[Raymond Federman]]'s novel ''The Twofold Vibration'',&lt;ref&gt;Federman, Raymond. ''The Twofold Vibration''. Green Integer.  2000. ({{ISBN|978-1-892295-29-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; and is mentioned throughout [[William T. Vollmann]]'s book ''Imperial''.&lt;ref&gt;Vollmann, William T., ''Imperial''. Viking, 2009 ({{ISBN|978-0-670-02061-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been quoted in an article in ''The New Yorker'' about [[David Foster Wallace]]'s legacy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/03/09/090309fa_fact_max&lt;/ref&gt;

He created a theory of media/visual studies about the relation between memory, narrative, and sexuality called "Avant-Porn," as claimed in his introduction to [[Michael Hemmingson]]'s 2000 anthology, ''WTF: The Avant-Porn Anthology''.&lt;ref&gt;see http://spinelessbooks.com/mccaffery/dustdevil/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; a true account.&lt;ref&gt;"Dust Devil" (critifictional introduction) In Michael Hemmingson, ed., ''What the Fuck: The Avant-Porn Anthology''.  NY: Soft Skull Press, 2001, pp. i–xi. ({{ISBN|978-1-887128-61-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;  In the dedication to his book, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=M0Qu9AVGNeAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=brooks+landon,+science+fiction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JkDKuQ_ybl&amp;sig=1YF9jHFZIPsgR33w-2YwQaGPboA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kxtoTe_VFJO0sAPU3dSmBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Science Fiction After 1900: From the Steam Man to the Stars]'', Brooks Landon calls McCaffery, "Pomo's Pure Product, Cyberpunk's Critical Case Officer, Avant Pop's Main Man, and SF's Friend in the High Castle".

McCaffery is also author of the popular ''best of'' list The [[20th Century’s Greatest Hits: 100 English-Language Books of Fiction]]. This list was written in response to [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels]] list (1999), which McCaffery saw as "being way, way out of touch with the nature and significance of 20th century fiction".&lt;ref&gt;''American Book Review'', September/October 1999, Volume 20, Issue 6. (http://www.litline.org/abr/issues/volume20/issue6/abr100.html)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCaffery's 100 and explanation at Spineless Books (http://www.spinelessbooks.com/mccaffery/100/index.html)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mark Doty''' (born August 10, 1953) is an [[United States of America|American]] [[poet]] and [[memoir]]ist. He was the winner of the [[National Book Award]] for Poetry in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/mark-doty|title=Mark Doty|last=Doty|first=Mark|date=2014-02-05|website=Mark Doty|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mark Doty was born in [[Maryville, Tennessee]]&lt;ref name="thescotsmanstanzafestivalmarkdoty"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mansfield|first1=Susan|title=StAnza festival: Mark Doty talks Walt Whitman|url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/books/stanza-festival-mark-doty-talks-walt-whitman-1-2818025|accessdate=April 9, 2018|work=The Scotsman|date=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Lawrence and Ruth Doty, with an older sister, Sarah Alice Doty. He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Drake University]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], and received his [[Master of Fine Arts]] in [[creative writing]] from [[Goddard College]] in [[Plainfield, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.goddard.edu/event/mark-doty-poetry-reading/ |title=Biography on Goddard College webpage |access-date=2016-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Doty's first collection of poems, ''Turtle, Swan'', was published by David R. Godine in 1987; a second collection, ''Bethlehem in Broad Daylight'', appeared from the same publisher in 1991. ''Booklist'' described his verse as "quiet, intimate" and praised its original style in turning powerful young urban experience into "an example of how we live, how we suffer and transcend suffering".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/mark-doty |title=Biography|access-date=2016-02-26 |work=Poetry Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doty's "Tiara" was printed in 1990 in an anthology called Poets for Life: Seventy-Six Poets Respond to AIDS. This poem critiques the way society perceived and treated homosexual AIDS sufferers. The 1980s marked the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the United States. The Reagan administration's delayed action to fight AIDS resulted in thousands of deaths, especially among young gay men.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, Randy. And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic. New York: St. Martin's, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe the initial reluctance to mobilize was due to homophobia—society was, at the time, uncomfortable with gay sexuality. This poem criticizes the idea that gay men "invite[d] their own oppression as a consequence of pleasure."&lt;ref name="Landau, Deborah 1996"&gt;Landau, Deborah. "How to Live. What to Do: The Poetics and Politics of AIDS." American Literature 68.1 (1996): 193-225. JSTOR. Web. 19 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem's phrase "he asked for it" represents this common, unsympathetic opinion about gay men with AIDS. Imagery like "perfect stasis" and "body's paradise" is used by Doty to paint a future beyond brutality and discrimination for AIDS sufferers. According to Landau, Doty's poems were "humane and comforting narratives" that offered hope to people living with HIV and stood in contrast to the hostile climate of the United States.&lt;ref name="Landau, Deborah 1996"/&gt;

His third book of poetry, ''My Alexandria'' (University of Illinois Press, 1993), reflects the grief, perceptions and new awareness gained in the face of great and painful loss. In 1989, Doty's partner Wally Roberts tested positive for [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="toibin"&gt;{{citation |title=Love in a Dark Time: And Other Explorations of Gay Lives and Literature |first=Colm |last=Toibin |authorlink=Colm Toibin |year=2002 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0-7432-4467-2 |page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection, written while Roberts had not yet become ill, contemplates the prospect of mortality, desperately attempting to find some way of making the prospect of loss even momentarily bearable. ''My Alexandria'' was chosen for the National Poetry Series by [[Philip Levine (poet)|Philip Levine]], and won the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] and the [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize]]. When the book was published in the U.K. by Jonathan Cape, Doty became the first American poet to win the [[T.S. Eliot Prize]], Britain's most significant annual award for poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sutherland |first= Amy |date=2013-01-06 |title=Mark Doty: Poet and biography buff

Doty had begun the poems collected in ''Atlantis'' (HarperCollins, 1995) when Roberts died in 1994. The book won the Bingham Poetry Prize and the Ambassador Book Award. ''Heaven's Coast: A Memoir'' (HarperCollins, 1996), is a meditative account of losing a loved one, and a study in grief. The book received the PEN Martha Albrand Award First Nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;h//www.pen.org/page.php/prmID/896&lt;/ref&gt;

Doty is the author of nine books of poetry, most recently ''Deep Lane'' (W.W. Norton, 2015), a book of descents: into the earth beneath the garden, into the dark substrata of a life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.goddard.edu/event/mark-doty-poetry-reading/ |title=Mark Doty Poetry Reading |access-date=2016-02-26 |work=Notes on Goddard College Lecture series 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written essays on still life painting, objects and intimacy, and a handbook for writers. His volumes of poetry include ''Sweet Machine'' (HarperCollins, 1998), ''Source'', (HarperCollins, 2002), ''School of the Arts'' (HarperCollins, 2005) and ''Fire to Fire: New and Selected Poems'' (HarperCollins, 2008), which received the National Book Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalbook.org/nbawinners_category.html#.VtIAOsdzTv0 |title=National Book Award Winners: 1950 – 2014 (Alpha By Category) |access-date=2016-02-26 |work=National Book Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doty's three memoirs include ''Heaven's Coast'', described as "searing" by The New York Times, is the excruciating journaling of his thoughts subsequent to hearing his lover's diagnosis with AIDS, a work "layered" with awarenesses like Dante's trip through hell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kirby |first= David |date=1996-03-10 |title=The Survivor (review of Heaven's Coast A Memoir)

memoirs received the American Library Associations Israel Fishman Non-Fiction Award. His most recent memoir, ''Dog Years'' (HarperCollins, 2005), was a New York Times Bestseller and received the Barbara Gittings Literature Award from the American Library Association in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/glbtrt/award/honored#2005 |title=Stonewall Award List |access-date=2016-02-26 |work=American Library Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905113937/http://www.ala.org/glbtrt/award/honored |archivedate=September 5, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doty's essays include ''Still Life with Oysters and Lemon'' (Beacon Press, 2001), a book-length essay about 17th-century Dutch painting and our relationships to objects, and ''The Art of Description'' (Graywolf Books, 2010), a collection of four essays in which, "Doty considers the task of saying what you see, and the challenges of rendering experience through language." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pw.org/content/the_art_of_description_world_into_word |title=Book description by Poets and Writer's Magazine |access-date=2016-02-26 |work=The Art of Description: World Into Word by Mark Doty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as guest editor for "''The Best American Poetry 2012'' (Scribners, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bestamericanpoetry.com/archive/ |title=Best American Poetry Archive |access-date=2016-02-26 |work=The Best American Poetry 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3046">'''Microsoft Semblio''' is a [[software development kit]] for development of rich [[educational software]]. Version 1.0 was published by [[Microsoft]] on 15 December 2008.&lt;ref name=dlsdk&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Semblio SDK|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18800|work=Download Center|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before its launch it was codenamed ''Grava'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whittaker|first1=Zack|title=Microsoft Semblio makes its debut; it won't take off {{!}} ZDNet|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-semblio-makes-its-debut-it-wont-take-off/|website=ZDNet|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to become a set of tools for creating and using educational and training materials. The tools were to be built using [[Windows Presentation Foundation|WPF]] and consists of the following components:
*'''Grava SDK:''' The Grava SDK is built on top of WPF and provides a programming model consistent with it. It also includes a set of services for assessment and logging results.
*'''Grava Authoring:''' The Grava authoring tool can be used to create interactive training material using GUI-based authoring. It can be used to create wizard like content or follow non-linear content creation. It integrates with developer tools like [[Microsoft Visual Studio]].
*'''Grava Player:''' The Grava player can play back interactive Grava content, and can use the logging and assessment services to track the progress of the trainee.

The Microsoft Semblio [[Software development kit|SDK]] is built on the [[.NET Framework 3.5]], and is intended to provide developers with tools for packaging and distribution of rich interactive learning material, such as [[e-books]] containing [[image]]s, [[sound|audio]], and [[video]].&lt;ref name="dlsdk"/&gt; Version 1.0 of the [[Software development kit|SDK]] can be freely downloaded from [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name="dlsdk"/&gt;

The SDK is the first of three components that will make up the ''Semblio Platform''. The other two includes an assembly tool and a [[Media player (application software)|media player]].&lt;ref name=campus&gt;{{cite web|last=Nagel|first=David|title=Microsoft Rolls Out Semblio SDK|url=http://campustechnology.com/Articles/2009/02/03/Microsoft-Rolls-Out-Semblio-SDK.aspx|work=Campus Technology|accessdate=12 October 2013|date=3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Semblio [[file format]] (.semblio) is based on ISO/IEC 29500-2:2008 [[Open Packaging Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Jack|title=Adventures in Packaging - Episode 1|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/opc/archive/2009/05/18/adventures-in-packaging-episode-1.aspx?Redirected=true|work=Packaging Team Blog: Open Packaging Conventions|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1612">A '''night safari''' is a [[nocturnal]] visit to a [[zoo]] or wildlife-spotting natural area. The term was first used by the [[Night Safari, Singapore]], which opened in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nightsafari.com.sg/about/fastfacts.htm Night Safari - World's First in Singapore]&lt;/ref&gt;
While the term generally applies to zoos or facilities that allow visitors to view animals within enclosures or fenced areas, the term is expanding to include viewing of wildlife in national parks and other natural areas, such as in Laos.

'''Offensive Security Certified Professional''' ('''OSCP''') is an [[White hat (computer security)|ethical hacking]] [[professional certification|certification]] offered by [[Offensive Security]] company that teaches [[penetration testing]] methodologies and the use of the tools included with the [[Kali Linux]] distribution (successor of [[BackTrack]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Offensive Security Certified Professional| url=https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/ |publisher=Offensive Security |accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OSCP is a hands-on [[penetration testing]] certification, requiring holders to successfully attack and penetrate various live machines in a safe lab environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ethicalhacker.net/columns/linn/final-course-exam-review-pen-testing-with-backtrack |title=Final Course and Exam Review: Pen Testing with BackTrack |author=Linn, Ryan |date=1 March 2010 |publisher=EH-Net Online Mag |accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered more technical than other ethical hacking certifications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intelligent-defense.softwareadvice.com/how-to-get-an-ethical-hacker-job-0714/ |title=How to Get a Job as an Ethical Hacker |date=15 July 2014 |last=Westfall |first=Brian |accessdate=13 October 2016 |work=Intelligent Defense |publisher=Software Advice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/3105496/security/how-well-does-social-engineering-work-one-test-returned-150.html |title=How well does social engineering work? One test returned 150% |last=Dix |first=John |date=11 August 2016 |accessdate=13 October 2016 |publisher=[[Network World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the few certifications that requires evidence of practical [[penetration testing]] skills.&lt;ref name=IAnewsletter&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.csiac.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Vol15_No2.pdf |title=Certification Spotlight: Offensive Security's OSCP |date=2012 |last=Merritt |first=Chris |journal=IAnewsletter |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=24-25 |publisher=[[Information Assurance Technology Analysis Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==OSCP course==
The course leading up to the OSCP certification was first offered in 2006 under the name "Offensive Security 101". Students expecting a [[101 (term)|101 course]] were not prepared for the level of effort the course requires, so the name was changed to "Pentesting With BackTrack" in December 2008, and again to "Penetration Testing With Kali Linux" when the BackTrack distribution was rebuilt as Kali.&lt;ref name=IAnewsletter /&gt;

The course covers common attack vectors used during penetration tests and audit. The course is offered in two formats, either online or live "instructor led" classes. The online course is a package consisting of videos, a PDF, lab assignments and lab access. The instructor led course is intensive live training covering the same material, also with lab access. The labs are accessible via a high speed internet connection, and contain a variety of [[operating system]]s and network devices where the students perform their assignments.

==OSCP challenge==
Upon completion of the course students become eligible to take the certification challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Information Security Training and Ethical Hacking Courses| url=https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/ |accessdate=13 Oct 2016| publisher=Offensive Security}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are given 24 hours in an unfamiliar lab to successfully complete the exam requirements. Documentation must include procedures used and proof of successful penetration including special marker files that are changed per exam.  Exam results are reviewed by a certification committee and a reply is given within 72 hours.

==Re-certification==
The OSCP does not require re-certification.

== Relations to other security trainings or exams ==
Successful completion of the OSCP exam qualifies the student for 40 [[(ISC)²]] [[continuing professional development|CPE]] credits.

In 2015, the UK's predominant accreditation body for penetration testing, CREST,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/74275/ |title=Analysis and recommendations for standardization in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment: Penetration testing market survey |last1=Knowles |first1=William |last2=Baron |first2=Alistair |last3=McGarr |first3=Tim |date=26 May 2015 |publisher=[[BSI Group]] &amp; [[Lancaster University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; began recognising OSCP as equivalent to their intermediate level qualification CREST Registered Tester (CRT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=CREST Signs New Partnership with Offensive Security to Improve the Standards of Information Security|date=4 August 2015|publisher=CREST and Offensive Security|url=https://www.crest-approved.org/2015/08/04/crest-partnership-with-offensive-security/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''People to People Student Ambassador Program''' was a travel service based in [[Spokane, Washington]], offering domestic and international travel opportunities to [[middle school|middle]] and [[high school]] students. The group was founded in 1956 and reincorporated in 1995. 
People to People Student Ambassador Programs closed in 2015.  Since then, People to People International has appointed ECE International to be the new travel operator.   

Since its founding, nearly half a million students, adults and athletes have participated in the ambassador programs.&lt;ref name=sec10k&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1162315/000116231511000016/form10k_.htm |title= Form 10-K |author= [[Ambassadors Group]] |date= December 31, 2010 |work= [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] |accessdate= June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, the services offered have been operated by [[Ambassadors Group]], a for-profit [[company]].&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news |url= http://stocks.us.reuters.com/stocks/fullDescription.asp?symbol=EPAX.O&amp;WTmodLOC=L2-LeftNav-8.5-FullDescription |title= Ambassadors Group Inc (EPAX.O) |work= [[Reuters]] |year= 2011 |accessdate= June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though open to international primary and secondary school students, programs are primarily for [[United States|American]] students aged 10 through 18.

== History ==
[[File:Eisenhower with People to People committee.jpg|thumb|President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] with the People to People committee in 1960.]]
In 1956, U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sought diplomatic alternatives to the wars he witnessed as a soldier, general and Allied Commander. On September 11, 1956, he called a [[White House]] conference of 100 top American leaders, who joined him in creating the People to People initiative, focused on creating [[United States Cultural Exchange Programs|cultural exchange programs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/digital_documents/People_to_People/People_to_People.html |title= People-to-People Program |work= [[Eisenhower Presidential Center]] |accessdate= June 16, 2011 |date= December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for this conference came after a [[Geneva]] summit, where Eisenhower and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] expressed enthusiasm for exchange programs as a means to ease [[Cold War]] tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ptpi.org/about_us/History.aspx |title= People to People International History |work= [[People to People International]] |year= 2011 |accessdate= June 16, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110811085336/http://www.ptpi.org/about_us/History.aspx |archivedate= August 11, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in this conference included [[Joyce Hall]], comedian [[Bob Hope]], and [[Walt Disney]], who became one of the founding directors of People to People and later drew inspiration from the initiative to create the "[[It's a Small World]]" attraction in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Youth Forum|url=http://www.ptpime.org/|publisher=[[People to People International]]|accessdate=June 16, 2011|year=2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916022225/http://www.ptpime.org/|archivedate=September 16, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was originally sponsored by the [[United States Information Agency|U.S. Information Agency]], a branch of the Federal Government. In 1961, Eisenhower decided that it should be preserved by private citizens and asked Joyce Hall, founder of [[Hallmark Cards]], to facilitate the privatization. That same year, the nonprofit People to People International began a contractual relationship with Ambassador Programs, Inc. to administer People to People travel programs for adults and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.peopletopeople.com/our-history/ |title= President Eisenhower {{!}} History of People to People International Travel Programs }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, the first delegation of university students traveled overseas and stayed with families all over [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.wickedlocal.com/halifax/news/x1745235669/People-to-People |title= People to People |work= [[Halifax-Plympton Reporter]] |first= Frank |last= Mand |date= January 14, 2011 |accessdate= June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Student Ambassador Program was organized in 1962, with regular programs beginning in 1967. Until expansion in the 1980s, the organization sent only a few hundred students abroad each year.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; In 2002, [[People to People International]] granted a license to operate student programs under the ''People to People Student Ambassador Program'' name to [[Ambassadors Group]], which had been formed as a separate company out of the Ambassadors Education Group.&lt;ref name=sec10k/&gt;

== Programs ==

[http://www.sportsambassadors.org/sports-ambassadors-program/ People to People Ambassador Programs] offers four types of ambassador travel, including international student ambassador travel, domestic leadership ambassador summits and forums, international collegiate ambassador travel, and international citizen ambassador travel for industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.peopletopeople.com/about-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries that have been visited include [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Fiji]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Russia]]. Experienced alumni students looking to participate in the program again are given the ability to choose more exotic destinations for subsequent trips such as [[South Africa]], or [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name=sec10k/&gt; Programs typically depart between June and August, rather than during the [[academic year]], in groups of between thirty and forty students with a target student teacher ratio of 10-to-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.bbb.org/eastern-washington/business-reviews/travel-escorts/ambassador-programs-inc-in-spokane-wa-5000902/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trips usually have students from a given city or county, not from a specific school. Tuition – the fees charged for a trip – range from $4,500 for trips to Canada to more than $7,999 for trips to Australia and the South Pacific. A trip to Antarctica was also available for $12,500, however this fee was not listed on their website and is no longer available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.peopletopeople.com/about-us/people-to-people-program-cost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trips, students attend various educational activities, including the chance to meet local leaders and dignitaries; trips also feature outdoor activities such as hiking, snorkeling, zip-lining or repelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.peopletopeople.com/why-people-to-people/unique-and-exclusive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer itineraries include a 2- to 3-day home stay with a local family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.peopletopeople.com/why-people-to-people/cultural-immersion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each student ambassador travel program includes a service component in which ambassadors participate in hands-on community service projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.peopletopeople.com/why-people-to-people/service-in-action}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants can also earn high school or college credit for classes through the Washington School of World Studies (operated by People to People), as well as through Eastern Washington University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.peopletopeople.com/why-people-to-people/academic-success}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People to People Ambassador Programs also offers domestic student trips for grade school, middle school and high school students through Leadership Ambassador Programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.peopletopeople.com/our-programs/leadership-ambassadors}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are focused on leadership development, community involvement, civics education and college preparation. Leadership Ambassador Programs include student trips to various U.S. destinations, including Washington D.C., New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles, to hear from speakers and industry experts, and exchange ideas with their peers from around the world. On these four- to ten-day programs, delegates engage in leadership curriculum, team-building and personal development exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.peopletopeople.com/our-programs/leadership-ambassadors/leadership-catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any student (5th grade or older) can apply to travel on a program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.peopletopeople.com/our-programs/student-ambassadors/student-faq}}&lt;/ref&gt; All students must complete an application and an interview process before they can go on a trip to ensure that they possess the maturity and social skills needed for extended travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.peopletopeople.com/our-programs/student-ambassadors/become-a-student-ambassador}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nomination process is open to any applicant, but some parents have complained that the program's marketing makes it appear that their child was exclusively selected or nominated to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.azcentral.com/12news/consumer/articles/people-to-people-script09222006-CR.html |title= Parents complain People to People International is misleading |work= [[The Arizona Republic]] |first= Dave |last= Cherry |date= September 21, 2006 |accessdate= June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Iowa Attorney General]] investigated the program's operator in 2006 after an invitation was accidentally sent to a family's long-deceased child, leading the operator to slightly modify the invitation and presentation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.state.ia.us/government/ag/latest_news/releases/june_2006/People_to_People.html | title=People to People Student Ambassador Program Agrees to Modify Representations About How Students are "Selected" for International Travel | publisher=Iowa Attorney General | date= June 8, 2006 | accessdate= October 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another case, a family received a People to People solicitation claiming that their deceased family pet had been selected as an ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/12/p2p_earl.html | title=People to Dead Cat Invited to participate in abroad program | publisher=Consumer Affairs | date=September 8, 2007 | accessdate=October 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2015, Ambassadors Group, the Spokane-based education travel company that arranges popular People to People tours, announced in a news release it is closing and all of its employees will be laid off. It reported a 2014 loss of $17.5 million.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Deposits for 2016 trips will be refunded. Layoffs will begin July 27. The company will close by the end of 2015. Declining revenues and smaller numbers of student travelers drove the decision to close.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Controversies==

In 2007, student ambassador Tyler Hill died of complications following his group's hike on [[Mount Fuji]] in [[Japan]]. The family sued the program and its parent company, reaching a settlement in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.kare11.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=821471 |title= Settlement reached in teen traveler wrongful death lawsuit |date= August 9, 2009 |work= [[KARE]] |first= John |last= Croman |accessdate= June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2008/01/p2p_hill.html |title= People to People Faces Wrongful Death Lawsuit |date= January 29, 2008 |work= [[KARE]] |accessdate= September 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.startribune.com/local/west/14600127.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2008/jan/30/parents-of-dead-student-sue-people-to-people/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.napil.net/2009/08/settlement-reached-in-case-of-minn.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012164208/http://www.napil.net/2009/08/settlement-reached-in-case-of-minn.html |archivedate=2011-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, People to People invested more than $3 million to support health and safety initiatives.&lt;ref name=spokesman/&gt; The Company also hired a full-time Senior Director of Health and Safety and began a Safe Travel 24/7 blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ptpsafety.blogspot.com |title= Safe Travel 24/7 blog |first= Michael J. |last= Bowers |year= 2011 |accessdate= June 16, 2011 |work= People to People Ambassadors Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, People to People Ambassador Programs launched the FindMe program with Cellhire that allows a mobile phone to be tracked using [[GPS]] or [[Mobile phone tracking|cell tower triangulation]].&lt;ref name=spokesman&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.spokesman.com/blogs/officehours/2011/jun/08/ambassadors-adds-gps-phones-its-summer-travel-groups/ |title= Ambassadors adds GPS phones to its summer travel groups |work= [[The Spokesman-Review]] |date= June 8, 2011 |accessdate= June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents of students may also rent the FindMe phone and have text conversations with their children through the FindMe website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.landairsea.com/gps-tracking-blog/gps-devices-track-student-travelers-around-the-world/ |title= GPS Devices Track Student Travelers around the World |publisher= Land Air Sea |date= August 3, 2010 |accessdate= September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3441">The '''Pre-vocational Certificate''' is a [[Vocational education in Mauritius|vocational]] qualification in [[Mauritius]] designed for early school leavers who have failed to successfully complete the exams required for the [[Certificate of Primary Education]], a pre-requisite for entry into [[Secondary education in Mauritius|secondary school]], or who are at or above age 13. The qualification is offered by the [[Mauritius Institute of Training and Development]]. The pre-vocational programme includes Form I Vocational, Form II Vocational, Form III Vocational, and Form IV Vocational stages of education.

==History==

Previously, students followed a pre-vocational course of education followed by the [[National Trade Certificate Foundation]] (NTC F) course led by the [[Mauritius Institute of Training and Development]]. However, this course option has been gradually phased out and replaced with a programme of study of four years of pre-vocational education followed by the NTC F course.&lt;ref name="MITDPreVoc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MITDPreVoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitd.mu/booklet.pdf |title=Mauritius Institute of Training and Development: Your Training Partner for Employability}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MITDPreVoc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MruPreVoc"&gt;http://ministry-education.gov.mu/English/educationsector/seceducation/prevoca/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MruVocSectorGuide"&gt;http://ministry-education.gov.mu/English/Documents/Publications/Secondary%20Curriculum%20Framework.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ministry-education.gov.mu/English/educationsector/seceducation/prevoca/Documents/A%20Guide%20to%20PreVocational%20Educators.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/upload/Mauritius/Mauritius_Prevoc2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entry requirements==

Entry into the Pre-vocational Certificate programme generally requires completion of Standard 6 of [[Primary education in Mauritius|primary school]]. It is at this stage of education that students take the examinations for the [[Certificate of Primary Education]]; students who fail to take the exams or who are unsuccessful in completing or passing the exams may then progress onto the Pre-vocational Certificate and enter into the vocational stream of education. 

==Curriculum==
The pre-vocational programme of study includes instruction in the following subjects:&lt;ref name="MITDPreVoc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MruVocSectorGuide" /&gt;

* '''Communication Skills'''
** Arts
** [[Mauritian Creole|Kreol]]
** [[English language|English]]
** [[French language|French]]
* '''Numeracy and Problem Solving Skills'''
** Mathematics
** Science
** Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
* '''Life Skills'''
** Values and Citizenship Education
** Health and Physical Education
* '''Livelihood and Trade Skills'''
** Design and Technology
** Home Economics
** Entrepreneurship Skills

==Progression==
Students who complete the course may then progress onto the [[National Trade Certificate]] (NTC) or enter directly into employment. Advanced NTC courses have as pre-requisites lower level courses or their academic or vocational equivalents. Those who successfully complete the NTC can then progress further onto a [[Higher National Diploma]] course followed by a [[Bachelor's degree]] course, enabling re-entry into the academic stream.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15492">'''Progress tests''' are longitudinal, feedback oriented [[educational assessment]] tools for the evaluation of development and sustainability of cognitive knowledge during a learning process. A progress test is a written knowledge exam (usually involving multiple choice questions) that is usually administered to all students in the "A" program at the same time and at regular intervals (usually twice to four times yearly) throughout the entire academic program. The test samples the complete knowledge domain expected of new graduates upon completion of their courses, regardless of the year level of the student). The differences between students’ knowledge levels show in the test scores; the further a student has progressed in the curriculum the higher the scores. As a result, these resultant scores provide a longitudinal, repeated measures, curriculum-independent assessment of the objectives (in knowledge) of the entire programme.&lt;ref name=MT18_103&gt;van der Vleuten CPM, Verwijnen GM, Wijnen WHFW. 1996. Fifteen years of experience with progress testing in a problem-based learning curriculum. Medical Teacher 18(2):103–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

They are well established and increasingly used in [[medical education]] in both undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. They are used formatively and summatively.

==Use in academic programs==
The progress test is currently used by national progress test consortia in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, D. B., Holtzman, K. Z., Butler, A., Langer, M. M., Nelson, M. V., Chow, J. W.

The progress test serves several important functions in academic programs. Considerable empirical evidence from medical schools in the Netherlands, Canada, United Kingdom and Ireland, as well postgraduate medical studies and schools in dentistry and psychology have shown that the longitudinal feature of the progress test provides a unique and demonstrable measurement of the growth and effectiveness of students’ knowledge acquisition throughout their course of study

As a result, this information can be consistently used for diagnostic, remedial and prognostic teaching and learning interventions.  In the Netherlands, these interventions have been aided by the provision of a web-based results feedback system known as ProF &lt;ref&gt;Muijtjens, A. M. M., Timmermans, I., Donkers, J., Peperkamp, R., Medema, H., Cohen-Schotanus, J., et al. (2010). Flexible electronic feedback using the virtues of progress testing. Medical Teacher, 32, 491-495.&lt;/ref&gt; in which students can compare their results with their peers across different total and subtotal score perspectives, both across and within universities.

Additionally, the longitudinal data can serve as a transparent quality assurance measure for program reviews by providing an evaluation of the extent to which a school is meeting its curriculum objectives.&lt;ref name=MT18_103/&gt;&lt;ref name=MT32_503/&gt;&lt;ref name=MT27_514&gt;Verhoeven, B.

The versatility of progress testing assessed in an international context: a start for benchmarking global standardization? Medical Teacher, 27(6), 514-520.&lt;/ref&gt; The test also provides more reliable data for high-stakes assessment decisions by using measures of continuous learning rather than a one-shot method (Schuwirth, 2007).  Inter-university progress testing collaborations provide a means of improving the cost-effectiveness of assessments by sharing a larger pool of items, item writers, reviewers, and administrators. The collaborative approach adopted by the Dutch and other consortia has enabled the progress test to become a benchmarking instrument by which to measure the quality of educational outcomes in knowledge. The success of the progress test in these ways has led to consideration of developing an international progress test.&lt;ref name=MT27_514/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schauber, S., &amp; Nouns, Z. B. (2010). Using the cumulative deviation method for cross-institutional benchmarking in the Berlin progress test. Medical Teacher, 32, 471-475.&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits for all main stakeholders in a medical or health sciences programme make the progress test an appealing tool to invest resources and time for inclusion in an assessment regime. This attractiveness is demonstrated by its increasingly widespread use in individual medical education institutions and inter-faculty consortia around the world, and by its use for national and international benchmarking practices.

==Advantages==
Progress tests provide a rich source of information: the comprehensive nature in combination with the cross-sectional and longitudinal design offers a wealth of information both for individual learners as well as for curriculum evaluations.&lt;ref name=MT18_103/&gt;

Progress Testing fosters knowledge retention: the repeated testing of the same comprehensive domain of knowledge means that there is no point testing facts that could be remembered if studied the night before. Long term knowledge and knowledge retention is fostered because item content remains relevant long after the knowledge has been learned. Progress Testing removes the need for resit examinations: every new test occasion is a renewed opportunity to demonstrate growth of knowledge.

Progress Testing allows early detection of high achievers: some learners perform (far) beyond the expected level of their phase in training (e.g. they might have had relevant previous other training) and, depending on their performance, individual and more speeded pathways through the curriculum could be offered.

Progress Testing brings stability in assessment procedures: curriculum changes, changes in content, have no consequence for the progress test provided the end outcomes are unchanged.

Progress Testing provides excellent benchmarking opportunities: progress tests are not limited to a single school nor to PBL curricula and evaluations can easily be done to compare graduates and the effectiveness of different curriculum approaches.

==Disadvantages==
Naturally, there are disadvantages. The required resources for test development and scoring and the need for a central organization are two very important ones.

Scoring,&lt;ref&gt;Muijtjens AM, Mameren HV, Hoogenboom RJ, Evers JL, van der Vleuten CP. 1999. The effect of a ‘don’t know’ option on test scores: Number-right and formula scoring compared. Medical Education 33(4):267–275.&lt;/ref&gt; psychometric procedures &lt;ref&gt;Shen L. 2000. Progress testing for postgraduate medical education: A four year experiment of American College of Osteopathic Surgeons Resident Examinations. Advances in Health Sciences Education: Theory and Practice 5(2):117–129&lt;/ref&gt; for reducing test difficulty variation and standard setting procedures &lt;ref&gt;Verhoeven BH, Snellen-Balendong HA, Hay IT, Boon JM, van der Linde MJ, Blitz-Lindeque JJ, Hoogenboom RJI, Verwijnen GM, Wijnen WHFW, Scherpbier AJJA, et al. 2005. The versatility of progress testing assessed in an international context: A start for benchmarking global standardization? Medical Teacher 27(6):514–520&lt;/ref&gt; are more complex in progress testing.

Finally progress tests do not work in heterogeneous programs with early specialization (like in many health sciences programs). In more homogenous programs, such as most medical programs, they work really well and pay off in relation to driving learning and use of resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6391">[[Image:Antoine Quatremère de Quincy by F Bonneville.jpg|thumb|Quatremère de Quincy, [[Engraving|stipple engraving]] by François Bonneville]]
'''Antoine-Chrysostome Quatremère de Quincy''' (21 October 1755 – 28 December 1849) was a [[France|French]] armchair [[archaeologist]] and [[Architectural theory|architectural theorist]], a [[Freemason]], and an effective arts administrator and influential writer on art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/quatremeredequincya.htm ''Dictionary of Art Historians'': Quatremère de Quincy, Antoine Chrysôthome.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Paris]], he trained for the law, then followed courses in art and history at the [[Collège Louis-le-Grand]] and apprenticed for a time in the atelier of [[Guillaume Coustou the Younger]] and [[Pierre Julien]], getting some practical experience in the art of sculpture. A trip to Naples in the company of [[Jacques-Louis David]] sparked his interest in Greek and Roman architecture.

He was involved in the troubles of the [[French Revolution]]. He was a royalist in the Legislative Assembly of 1791-2, and his politics were monarchist and Catholic. As a member of the Revolutionary Committee of Public Instruction his set of three ''Considerations on the arts of design in France'' was offered before the [[Assemblée Nationale]] at a time (1791) when the continuation of the former academies was under question; he offered a program for their reform. in part by opening up the [[Paris salon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Lavin, ''Quatremère de Quincy and the invention of a modern language of architecture'' (MIT Press), 1992, "The Republic of the arts", esp. pp 158-75.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791-92 he orchestrated the conversion of the Church of Ste-Geneviève in Paris (under the direction of [[Jean-Baptiste Rondelet]]) into the [[Panthéon]], infilling the windows to give it the character of a mausoleum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com James Stevens Curl, ''A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture''], ''s.v.'' "Quatremère de Quincy".&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1795 he was accused of taking part in the preparations for the royalist insurrection of ''13 vendémiaire'' and condemned to death, but acquitted in time.

In July 1796, Quatremere wrote a pseudo-epistolary treatise against the French plans to seize works of art from Rome, arguing that European powers should instead contribute a sum to the papacy for protecting art and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Translated as ''Letters to Miranda and Canova on the Abduction of Antiquities from Rome and Athens'' (Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, he was behind a petition signed by forty-seven Parisian artists including [[Jacques-Louis David]] which questioned the benefits of displacing art from Rome; although prudently worded, there was a vituperative official response.&lt;ref&gt;See David Gilks, "Art and politics during the ‘First’ Directory: artists’ petitions and the quarrel over the confiscation of works of art from Italy in 1796 " ''French history'' 26(2012), pp. 53-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year he was elected to the [[Council of Five Hundred]] from the Seine department, then went into hiding after taking part in a royalist coup; in exile in Germany, he read [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Gotthold Lessing]], whose philosophy informed his own theories of [[aesthetics]]. In 1800, back in Paris, he was appointed secretary general of the Seine council. From 1816 until 1839 he was perpetual secretary to the ''[[Académie des Beaux-Arts]]'', which gave him great influence upon official architecture, and in 1818 he became a professor of archaeology at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]]. He briefly returned to politics in 1820.

Quatremère de Quincy was the author of numerous articles and books. From 1788 to 1825, he wrote the three Architecture volumes of the ''[[Encyclopédie Méthodique]]''. His ''Dictionnaire historique de l'Architecture'' was published in 1832-33.&lt;ref&gt;Some passages translated and edited with an introduction by Samir Younés, ''The True, the Fictive and the Real: The historical Dictionary of Architecture of Quatremère de Quincy''(Papadakis) 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote biographies of several artists: [[Antonio Canova]] (1823), [[Raphael]] (1824) and [[Michelangelo]] (1835).

Quatremère de Quincy transformed the simple metaphor of architecture as language into a framework for reconceptualizing the structure of architecture; modern writers describing "vernacular" architecture, or the Baroque "idiom" or the "vocabulary" of Classicism owe a debt to Quatremère de Quincy&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Lavin, ''Quatremère de Quincy and the Invention of a Modern Language of Architecture'' (MIT Press) 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

His essay ''De l'Architecture Égyptienne'', written for a competition posed by the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] in 1785 and published in 1803, just as the ''[[Description de l'Egypte]]'' was in preparation, nevertheless was an important influence on the Egyptian Revival phase of [[Neoclassical architecture]], for its theoretical observations concerning the origins of architecture rather than for its historical naiveté.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Lavin, ("In the Names of History: Quatremere de Quincy and the Literature of Egyptian Architecture" ''Journal of Architectural Education'' '''44'''.3 [May 1991:131-137]) remarks that "while the name of history was increasingly invoked to lend an impersonal and hence authoritative voice to studies of the past, the individual voices continued to speak in the ideologically motivated language of the present" (p. 131).&lt;/ref&gt; He was among the first to point out the use of polychromy in Greek sculpture and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Jupiter olympien'', 1814.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he insisted that [[landscape gardening]] could not be admitted among the [[fine arts]], he was a key figure in the establishment of the first landscaped cemeteries, and his essay, translated into English as ''The Nature, the End and the Means of Imitation in the Fine Arts'' influenced [[J. C. Loudon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardenvisit.com/biography/antoine-chrysostome_quatremere_de_quincy Garden Visits: Quatremère de Quincy].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rebekka Lynn Armstrong''' is an American [[HIV|HIV/AIDs]] activist and former model and bodybuilder. She was ''Playboy'' [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate of the Month]] for September 1986. Eight years later, she was the first Playmate to publicly announce that she is HIV-positive.

==Biography==
Armstrong announced that she is HIV-positive in the September 1994 issue of ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''. She said that she had known she was infected since 1989, but spent two years after her diagnosis escaping into substance abuse. By the time of the publication of ''The Advocate'' article, she had come out as a [[lesbian]] and decided to educate others about HIV/AIDS, especially among lesbian and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] women. She said she was unsure of when she had contracted the virus, but might have as early as age 16.&lt;ref name=Kort940906&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kort |first=Michele |date=September 6, 1994 |title=Portrait of a Centerfold |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HGMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |journal=The Advocate |publisher=Sam Watters |volume= |issue=663 |pages=41–48 |doi= |accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time she was interviewed in 1999 for [[AIDS Project Los Angeles]] she identified as bisexual and said she had been infected at 16 "to the best of my knowledge."&lt;ref name=Forrest1999&gt;{{cite web |last=Forrest |first=Susan |date=November 1999 |title=A Bunny's Life |url=http://www.thebody.com/apla/nov99/bunny.html |website=thebody.com |publisher=Remedy Health Media |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A University of Toledo events notice in 2004 said that ''Playboy'' founder [[Hugh Hefner]] and the Playboy Foundation assisted Armstrong financially on her AIDS-awareness campaign, the College Campus Safer Sex education program.&lt;ref name=Strunk041129&gt;{{cite web |last=Strunk |first=Jon |date=November 29, 2004 |title=HIV-Infected Playboy Playmate to Speak With UT Students About Safe Sex |url=http://utnews.utoledo.edu/publish/Events_4/HIV-Infected_Playboy_Playmate_to_Speak_With_UT_Stu_1739.shtml |type=Event calendar |website=|publisher=University of Toledo |accessdate=September 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023240/http://utnews.utoledo.edu/publish/Events_4/HIV-Infected_Playboy_Playmate_to_Speak_With_UT_Stu_1739.shtml |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 speech to community college students in [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]], Washington, Armstrong shared details about the early days of her illness, the aggressive [[Zidovudine|AZT]] treatment that she endured, the good and bad times of that five-year period, and about her suicide attempt followed by a coma and a lengthy hospital stay.&lt;ref name=Rogers131029&gt;{{cite news |last=Rogers |first=Adrian |date=October 29, 2013 |title=Former model, Playboy playmate raises HIV awareness |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2013/oct/29/former-model-playboy-playmate-raises-hiv-awareness/ |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |accessdate=September 24, 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her former career as a model and her current activism, Armstrong has also competed as a bodybuilder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=September 19, 2008 |title=Rebekka Armstrong featured in Leadership Workshop Series Sept. 23 |url=http://www.ulm.edu/news/archives/2008/sept08/rebekka_armstrong.html |publisher=The University of Louisiana at Monroe |accessdate=June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal College of Science for Ireland''' ('''RCScI'''&lt;ref name="ucdrcsci"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/merrionstreet/rcsci.html|title=The Royal College of Science for Ireland|year=2011|work=Merrion Street|publisher=UCD|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an institute for [[higher education]] in Dublin which existed from 1867 to 1926, specialising in [[physical sciences]] and [[applied science]]. It was originally based on [[St. Stephen's Green]],  moving in 1911 to [[Government Buildings|a purpose-built "Royal College of Science" building]] on [[Merrion Street]]. In 1926 it was absorbed into [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) as the [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] of Science and Engineering.

==Foundation==
The Museum of Economic Geology was founded by the [[Dublin Castle administration]] in 1845, with chemist [[Robert Kane (chemist)|Robert Kane]] as curator, and a focus on [[mining in Ireland]] similar to the [[Geological Museum|Museum of Practical Geology]] in London.&lt;ref name="sc1864p9"&gt;Select Committee (1864) [http://www.dippam.ac.uk/eppi/documents/14615/page/380225 p.ix]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/list/exhibition-details-outofstorage.aspx?article=5be165bf-d84b-4c9a-a83f-4473c71bea70|title=The Museum of Irish Industry|work=Permanent Exhibitions &gt; Out of Storage|publisher=[[National Museum of Ireland]]|accessdate=16 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216193808/http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/list/exhibition-details-outofstorage.aspx?article=5be165bf-d84b-4c9a-a83f-4473c71bea70|archivedate=16 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Kane was promoted to director, expanding its remit, and renaming it the [[Museum of Irish Industry]] (MII).&lt;ref name="sc1864p9"/&gt; In 1853 a new [[Science and Art Department]] was created within [[Government of the United Kingdom|the Whitehall administration]], and in 1854 the MII placed under its remit.&lt;ref name="sc1864p14"&gt;Select Committee (1864) [http://www.dippam.ac.uk/eppi/documents/14615/page/380230 p.xiv]&lt;/ref&gt; A School of Science applied to Mining and the Arts was created, modelled on the [[Royal School of Mines]] in London, with four professorships shared jointly by the MII school and the [[Royal Dublin Society]] (RDS).&lt;ref name="sc1864p14"/&gt; The MII and School shared premises at 51, St. Stephen's Green, acquired in 1846 and fitted out by 1852.&lt;ref name="sc1864p9"/&gt; In 1864, a [[select committee]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliament]] recommended that the MII and School be entirely separated from the RDS and broadened into a government-supported College of Science for Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Select Committee (1864) [http://www.dippam.ac.uk/eppi/documents/14615/page/380239 p.xxiii §§5–8]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, [[HM Treasury]] agreed and in 1867 a commission was appointed by the education committee of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. The commission, headed by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]], outlined the scope and functions of the proposed college, and the RCScI mission statement on 11 September 1867 was:&lt;ref name="ucdarch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/archives/html/university/rcsi.htm|title=Royal College of Science in Ireland|work=Archives|publisher=UCD|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:The object of the Royal College of Science is to supply as far as practicable a Complete Course of instruction in Science applicable to the Industrial Arts, especially those which may be classed broadly under the heads of Mining, Agriculture, Engineering, and Manufactures, and to aid in the instruction of Teachers for the local Schools of Science

[[George Sigerson]] complained in 1868 that the RCScI was less open to Catholics than the MII had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Ireland: Its Vital Questions, Secret Societies, and Government |url=https://archive.org/details/modernirelandit00sigegoog |chapterurl=http://www.libraryireland.com/articles/ModIrelandRoyalCollege/index.php |year=1868 |publisher=Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer |location=London |pages=197–207 |chapter=The Royal College of Science for Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later development==
The RCScI's remit was later changed to exclude include agriculture and include "Physics and Natural Science".&lt;ref name="ucdarch"/&gt;  The number of students enrolled increased gradually.&lt;ref name="ivrla30371"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.ucd.ie/view/ivrla:30371|title=RCSI numbers of attendence &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;|date=1 December 2009|work=UCD Digital Library|publisher=UCD|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1898 the RCScI had chairs of Mining and Mineralogy, Physics, Chemistry, Zoology, Botany, Geology, Applied Mathematics and Mechanism, Descriptive Geometry and Engineering.&lt;ref name="ucdarch"/&gt; In 1900, control was transferred from the Science and Art Department in London to the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction in Dublin, headed by [[Horace Plunkett]].&lt;ref name="ucdrcsci"/&gt; A new building was proposed in 1897 and a site from [[Merrion Street]] to [[Kildare Street]] was chosen in 1898; in 1899 the plan was extended to include government administrative offices as well as the new college.&lt;ref name="ucdnewbldg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/merrionstreet/newbuilding.html|title=The New Building|year=2011|work=Merrion Street|publisher=UCD|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new building was designed by Sir [[Aston Webb]]; the [[foundation stone]] was laid in 1904 by [[Edward VII]] and it was opened in 1911 by [[George V]].&lt;ref name="ucdnewbldg"/&gt;

In 1926 the RCScI was absorbed into UCD where it became the UCD Science and Engineering faculties. Science moved to [[National Concert Hall|UCD's Earlsfort Terrace building]], and on to [[Belfield, Dublin|Belfield]]  in the 1960s; Engineering moved from Merrion Street to Belfield in 1989. The RCScI building was then absorbed into [[Government Buildings]] with the rest of Aston Webb's complex, lavishly renovated by [[Charles Haughey]] and used to house the [[Department of the Taoiseach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Historical_Information/History_of_Government_Buildings/|title=History of Government Buildings: 1904-1922 and 1990|publisher=Department of the Taoiseach|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tertiary education,''' also referred to as '''third stage, third level, '''and''' postsecondary education,''' is the educational level following the completion of a school providing a [[secondary education]]. The [[World Bank]], for example, defines tertiary education as including universities as well as trade schools and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/tertiaryeducation#what_why|title=Tertiary Education|work=World Bank|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Higher education]] is taken to include [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education]], while [[vocational education]] beyond secondary education is known as ''[[further education]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]], or ''[[continuing education]]'' in the [[United States]].

Tertiary education generally culminates in the receipt of [[Academic certificate|certificate]]s, [[diploma]]s, or [[academic degree]]s.

The UNESCO stated that tertiary education focuses on learning endeavors in specialized fields. It includes academic and higher vocational education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uis.unesco.org/node/334812|title=Tertiary education (ISCED levels 5 to 8)|website=uis.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work &lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that given the future of work and the increasing role of technology in value chains, tertiary education becomes even more relevant for workers to compete in the labor market.

== In the United Kingdom ==
"Tertiary education" includes [[further education]] (FE), as well as [[higher education]] (HE). Since the 1970s specialized FE colleges called “tertiary colleges” have been set up to offer courses such as [[A Levels]], that allow progression to HE, alongside vocational courses. An early example of this which expanded in September 1982 as part of a reorganization of education in the [[Halesowen]] area which also saw three-tier education axed after just 10 years in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lambert|first=Tim|title=A Brief History of Dudley, England |url=http://www.localhistories.org/dudley.html|work=A World History Encyclopedia|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas where schools do not universally offer sixth forms, tertiary colleges function as a sixth form college as well as a general FE college.

Unlike sixth form colleges, the staff join lecturers' rather than teachers' unions.

Under [[devolution in the United Kingdom]], education is administered separately in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. In 2018 the Welsh Government adopted the term "tertiary education" to refer to post-16 education and training in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://gov.wales/about/cabinet/cabinetstatements/2018/Nextsteps/?lang=en |title= Welsh Government {{!}} Written Statement - Public Good and a Prosperous Wales – Next steps |website= gov.wales |language=EN |access-date= 2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Australia ==
{{Main|Tertiary education in Australia}}
Within Australia "Tertiary Education" refers to continuing studies after a students [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]]. It also refers to any education a student receives after final compulsory schooling, which occurs at the age of 17 within Australia. Tertiary Education options include [[University]], [[Technical and further education|TAFE]] or private colleges.

== In the United States of America ==
The [[Higher education in the United States|higher education system in the United States]] is decentralized and essentially independent from regulation by the federal government. It is diverse because there are private and public institutions. Some are small and affiliated with religious organizations. Others could be secular, rural, urban, or suburban. In short, there are a wide variety of options which are often locally determined. The United States Department of Education presents a broad-spectrum view of tertiary education and detailed information on the nation's educational structure, accreditation procedures, and connections to state as well as federal agencies and entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/|title=National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Home Page, part of the U.S. Department of Education|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carnegie Classifications of Institutions of Higher Education provides an explanation so people will understand how American institutions of higher learning compare to each other. The Carnegie platform separates all accredited schools that give out degrees into categories that describe highest degree granted or special areas of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.carnegiefoundation.org/newsroom/news-releases/iu-research-center-house-carnegie-classification-institutions-higher-education/|title=IU research Center to House Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education {{!}} Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|date=2014-10-07|work=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; US tertiary education includes various non-profit organizations promoting professional development of individuals in the field of higher education and helping expand awareness of related issues like international student services and complete campus internationalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://educationusa.state.gov/foreign-institutions-and-governments/understanding-us-higher-education|title=Understanding U.S. Higher Education|date=2015-01-08|work=EducationUSA|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acenet.edu/Pages/default.aspx|title=The American Council on Education|website=www.acenet.edu|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the European Union ==
Although tertiary education in the [[European Union|EU]] includes university, it can differ from country to country.

=== In France ===
Along with IUT and STS, Universities (French: Universités) are tertiary educations.

After going to [[Elementary school]] (French: École maternelle), [[Primary school]] (French: École primaire), [[College]] (French: Collège), and [[Lycee]] (French: Lycée), a student may go to university, but may also [[Retirement|retire]] at that point.

* To provide an organization that advances the knowledge of conservation and improves the methods of conservation needed to protect, preserve, and maintain the condition and integrity of objects, structures, or sites that, because of their history, significance, rarity, or quality of work, have a commonly accepted value and importance for the public interest.

==History==
WAAC was founded in 1975 to bring together conservators practicing in the western United States to exchange ideas, information and news.

One of the prime forces behind the creation of the Western Association for Art Conservation, or Western Association of Art Conservators as it was initially called, was Benjamin Bishop Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James L. |last=Greaves|title= A Remembrance: Benjamin Bishop Johnson |work=WAAC Newsletter |volume= 13, Number 1 |date=January 1991 |page=10 |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn13/wn13-1/wn13-104.html |publisher=Cool.conservation-us.org |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who served as the first President of the organization; and at the time was Chief Conservator at [[LACMA]], as well as a lecturer at [[UCLA]].
