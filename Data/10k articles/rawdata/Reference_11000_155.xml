[[File:AEIOU Buchmalerei in der Handregistratur König Friedrichs IV 1446.jpg|thumb|Illumination from the records of King Frederick, dated 1446]]
"'''A.E.I.O.U.'''" was a [[symbol]]ic device personally used by [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] (1415–1493), who had a fondness for mythical formulae. He habitually signed buildings such as [[Burg Wiener Neustadt]] or [[Graz Cathedral]] as well as his tableware and other objects with the acronym.&lt;ref name="brewer"&gt;{{Citation | last = Brewer | first = E. Cobham | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Dictionary of Phrase and Fable | publisher = Avenel Books | date = 1978 |orig-year=reprint of 1894 version | location = Edwinstowe, England | isbn = 0-517-25921-4 | page = 1 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, A.E.I.O.U. is the [[motto]] of the [[Theresian Military Academy]], established in 1751.

==Interpretation==
[[File:Monogramm Friedrichs des III..png|thumb|left|upright|A.E.I.O.U. monogram of Frederick III]]
[[File:MeranSonnenuhr1.JPG|thumb|Sundial in [[Meran]] (now [[Italy]]) featuring an A.E.I.O.U. inscription]]
Frederick's first use of the five-letter monogram was in 1437, when he was [[Duke of Styria]]. One note in his notebook (discovered in 1666), though not in the same hand, explains it in German and Latin as "All the world is subject to Austria" (''Alles Erdreich ist Österreich untertan'' or ''Austriae est imperare orbi universo'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.habsburger.net/en/chapter/aeiou|title=AEIOU|work=Die Welt der Habsburger|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another passage, later in the same notebook, uses the letters in sequence as the initial letters of the words in the first line of a couplet poem, showing the meaning as "I am loved by the elect" (from Latin, ''amor electis, iniustis ordinor ultor'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.habsburger.net/en/chapter/aeiou|title=AEIOU|work=Die Welt der Habsburger|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other interpretations have been put forth, even by contemporary heraldists. Several explanations proceed on the assumption that it was meant as a political slogan, from the [[Latin language|Latin]] phrases:
* ''Austria est imperio optime unita'' ("Austria is best united by the Empire").&lt;ref name="MKL"&gt;"A", ''[[Meyers Konversationslexikon]]'', (various authors), Volume 1, page 1, 1885-1890, web (Commons): [[c:File:Meyers b1 s0001.jpg|MKL-b1-p1]]: has "A.E.I.O.U." on first page of entire 16-volume encyclopedia, as 3 Latin phrases: ''"Austriae est imperare orbi universo"'' and ''"Austriae est imperium orbis universi"'' with the German phrase ''"Alles Erdreich ist Oesterreich unterthan"'' noted with ''"Friedrich III."'', plus a 3rd Latin phrase ''"Austria erit in orbe ultima"'' with "''Österreich wird bestehen bis ans Ende der Welt"'' ("Austria will stand until the end of the world"); note that "Oesterreich" is "Österreich" ("Oe") with first letter "O". "Ö" is not considered a separate letter in German.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Austria erit in orbe ultima'' ("Austria will be the last (surviving) in the world").&lt;ref name=MKL/&gt;
* ''Austriae est imperare orbi universo'' ("It is Austria's destiny to rule the whole world").&lt;ref name=MKL/&gt;

Since Friderick wrote this acronym when he was not yet the ruler of the [[Archduchy of Austria]] and at that time, [[Styria]] was entirely separated from Austria and was not considered to be its part until the next century, the term "Austria" in this context would not mean Austria as a territory or a nation, but rather the "House of Austria", that is, the Habsburg dynasty.

More than 300 Latin and German interpretations have been attempted over the centuries; most of these versions refer to a motto of present-day [[Austria]] or the extensive [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

'''Artist Rooms''' is the title of a collection of international [[modern art|modern]] and [[contemporary art]], established through the [[Anthony d'Offay|d'Offay]] donation in 2008.&lt;ref name=tate1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/new-ps125-million-national-collection-will-bring-contemporary-art|title=New £125 Million national collection will bring contemporary art to audiences across Britain - Tate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comprising over 1,500 works by 38 artists, it is owned by the [[National Galleries of Scotland]] and the [[Tate]], on behalf of the [[United Kingdom]], which care for the collection together and arrange for its presentation throughout the country in museums, galleries, and exhibition spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/artist-rooms|title=ARTIST ROOMS - Tate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artist-rooms|title=ARTIST ROOMS − Collection −  National Galleries of Scotland|first=National Galleries of|last=Scotland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each "room" is devoted to a specific artist with the aim of providing an immersive and comprehensive experience of that artist's work, a format described by [[Nicholas Serota]] as being "without precedent anywhere in the world."&lt;ref name=tate1/&gt;

==Establishment==
In 2002, [[Anthony d’Offay]] closed the gallery he had run since 1963 with Anne Seymour and Marie-Louise Laband, and began building a collection of more than 1,000 works from internationally recognized artists, including [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst]].&lt;ref name=tate1/&gt; The collection, then valued in excess of £100 million, was donated jointly in 2008 to the [[National Galleries of Scotland]] and [[Tate]], with the assistance of the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]], [[the Art Fund]] and the [[Scottish Government|Scottish]] and [[British government]]s.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/5163760/Artist-Rooms-interview-with-Anthony-dOffay.html|title=Artist Rooms - interview with Anthony d'Offay|first=Interview by Alastair|last=Sooke|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present-day work==
Since 2009, there have been 132 Artist Rooms across the [[United Kingdom]], with more than 29 million exhibition visitors.&lt;ref name=tate1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artistrooms.org/about|title=About - Artist Rooms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Art Fund]] charity was one of the original principal supporters of Artist Rooms. It continues to sponsor the touring program of exhibitions from the collection and facilitates dynamic education projects in each venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artfund.org/what-to-see/artist-rooms/the-story|title=The story|first=Art|last=Fund|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Rooms exhibitions have been held in [[Tate Britain]], [[Tate Modern]], [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]], [[Wolverhampton Art Gallery]], [[National Museum Wales]], [[De La Warr Pavilion]], [[Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art|mima]], [[Kettle's Yard]], [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art]], [[The Hepworth]], and [[Tramway (arts centre)|Tramway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artistrooms.org/exhibitions|title=Rooms - Artist Rooms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
More than 55,000 young people have been involved in the education programs, which are supported by the Artist Rooms Foundation, created in 2011.&lt;ref name=tate1/&gt;

==Reception==

During its fifth anniversary, [[Maria Miller]], secretary of state for  culture, media and sport, stated that, "Artist Rooms has been a spectacular success since it was established just five years ago. Thanks to Anthony d’Offay’s generosity, and the hard work and imagination of all those involved in the project, really high quality art has been made available for millions to enjoy up and down the UK. Long may it continue."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitmima.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/PRFINAL-News-release-first-five-years-ARTIST-ROOMS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Doment wrote that, "it [Artist Rooms] is the most important thing that has happened in the art world in this country in my lifetime."&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

Similarly, [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] described Artist Rooms as, "the best collection of contemporary work," adding that, "what really matters is the strength of the works, and the fact that Britain's museums, large and small, can now draw on such a high-quality treasury."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/aug/24/artist-rooms|title=Artist Rooms: The great modern art roadshow|first=Jonathan|last=Jones|date=24 August 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12659">In [[category theory]], the concept of '''catamorphism''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[wikt:κατά|κατά]] "downwards" and [[wikt:μορφή|μορφή]] "form, shape") denotes the unique [[homomorphism]] from an [[initial algebra]] into some other algebra.

In [[functional programming]], catamorphisms provide generalizations of ''[[Fold (higher-order function)|folds]]'' of [[List (computing)|lists]] to arbitrary [[algebraic data type]]s, which can be described as [[initial algebra]]s. 
The dual concept is that of [[anamorphism]] that generalize ''unfolds''. A [[Hylomorphism (computer science)|hylomorphism]] is the composition of an anamorphism followed by a catamorphism.

== Definition ==
Consider an [[Initial algebra|initial]] [[F-algebra|''F''-algebra]] (''A'', ''in'') for some [[endofunctor]] ''F'' of some [[category (mathematics)|category]] into itself. Here ''in'' is a [[morphism]] from ''FA'' to ''A''. Since it is initial, we know that whenever (''X'', ''f'') is another ''F''-algebra, i.e. a morphism ''f'' from ''FX'' to ''X'', there is a unique [[homomorphism]] ''h'' from (''A'', ''in'') to (''X'', ''f''). By the definition of the category of ''F''-algebras, this ''h'' corresponds to a morphism from ''A'' to ''X'', conventionally also denoted ''h'', such that &lt;math&gt;h \circ in = f \circ Fh&lt;/math&gt;. In the context of ''F''-algebras, the uniquely specified morphism from the initial object is denoted by '''cata''' '''''f''''' and hence characterized by the following relationship:

*&lt;math&gt;h = \mathrm{cata}\ f&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;h \circ in = f \circ Fh&lt;/math&gt;

== Terminology and history ==
Another notation found in the literature is &lt;math&gt;(\!|f|\!)&lt;/math&gt;. The open brackets used are known as '''banana brackets''', after which catamorphisms are sometimes referred to as ''bananas'', as mentioned in {{Harvnb|Meijer|1991}}. 
One of the first publications to introduce the notion of a catamorphism in the context of programming was the paper “Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire”, by [[Erik Meijer (computer scientist)|Erik Meijer]] ''et al.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was in the context of the [[Squiggol]] formalism.
The general categorical definition was given by [[Grant Malcolm]].

== Examples ==
We give a series of examples, and then a more global approach to catamorphisms, in the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] programming language.

=== Iteration ===
Iteration-step prescriptions lead to natural numbers as initial object.

Consider the functor &lt;code&gt;fmaybe&lt;/code&gt; mapping a data type &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; to a data type &lt;code&gt;fmaybe b&lt;/code&gt;, which contains a copy of each term from &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; as well as one additional term &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; (in Haskell, this is what &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; does). This can be encoded using one term and one function. So let an instance of a ''StepAlgebra'' also include a function from &lt;code&gt;fmaybe b&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, which maps &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; to a fixed term &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and where the actions on the copied terms will be called &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
type StepAlgebra b = (b, b-&gt;b) -- the algebras, which we encode as pairs (nil, next)

data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat -- which is the initial algebra for the functor described above

foldSteps :: StepAlgebra b -&gt; (Nat -&gt; b) -- the catamorphisms map from Nat to b
foldSteps (nil, next) Zero       = nil
foldSteps (nil, next) (Succ nat) = next $ foldSteps (nil, next) nat
&lt;/source&gt;

As a silly example, consider the algebra on strings encoded as &lt;code&gt;("go!", \s -&gt; "wait.. " ++ s)&lt;/code&gt;, for which &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; is mapped to &lt;code&gt;"go!"&lt;/code&gt; and otherwise &lt;code&gt;"wait.. "&lt;/code&gt; is prepended. As &lt;code&gt;(Succ . Succ . Succ . Succ $ Zero)&lt;/code&gt; denotes the number four in &lt;code&gt;Nat&lt;/code&gt;, the following will evaluate to "wait.. wait.. wait.. wait.. go!": &lt;source lang="haskell" inline&gt;foldSteps ("go!", \s -&gt; "wait.. " ++ s) (Succ . Succ . Succ . Succ $ Zero)&lt;/source&gt;. We can easily change the code to a more useful operation, say repeated operation of an algebraic operation on numbers, just by changing the F-algebra &lt;code&gt;(nil, next)&lt;/code&gt;, which is passed to &lt;code&gt;foldSteps&lt;/code&gt;

=== List fold ===
For a fixed type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, consider the functor mapping types &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; to the product type of those two types. We moreover also add a term &lt;code&gt;Nil&lt;/code&gt; to this resulting type. An f-algebra shall now map &lt;code&gt;Nil&lt;/code&gt; to some special term &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; or "merge" a pair (any other term of the constructed type) into a term of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. This merging of a pair can be encoded as a function of type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
type ContainerAlgebra a b = (b, a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -- f-algebra encoded as (nil, merge)

data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a) -- which turns out to be the initial algbera

foldrList :: ContainerAlgebra a b -&gt; (List a -&gt; b) -- catamorphisms map from (List a) to b
foldrList (nil, merge) Nil         = nil
foldrList (nil, merge) (Cons x xs) = merge x $ foldrList (nil, merge) xs
&lt;/source&gt;

As an example, consider the algebra on numbers types encoded as &lt;code&gt;(3, \x-&gt; \y-&gt; x*y)&lt;/code&gt;, for which the number from &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; acts on the number from &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; by plain multiplication. Then the following will evaluate to 3.000.000: &lt;source lang="haskell" inline&gt;foldrList (3, \x-&gt; \y-&gt; x*y) (Cons 10 $ Cons 100 $ Cons 1000 Nil)&lt;/source&gt;

=== Tree fold ===
For a fixed type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, consider the functor mapping types &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; to a type that contains a copy of each term of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; as well as all pairs of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;'s (terms of the product type of two instances of the type &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;). An algebra consists of a function to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, which either acts on an &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; term or two &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; terms. This merging of a pair can be encoded as two functions of type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; resp. &lt;code&gt;b -&gt; b -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
type TreeAlgebra a b = (a -&gt; b, b -&gt; b -&gt; b) -- the "two cases" function is encoded as (f, g)
 
data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch (Tree a) (Tree a) -- which turns out to be the initial algebra
 
foldTree :: TreeAlgebra a b -&gt; (Tree a -&gt; b) -- catamorphisms map from (Tree a) to b
foldTree (f, g) (Leaf x)            = f x
foldTree (f, g) (Branch left right) = g (foldTree (f, g) left) (foldTree (f, g) right)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
treeDepth :: TreeAlgebra a Integer -- an f-algebra to numbers, which works for any input type
treeDepth = (const 1, \i j -&gt; 1 + max i j)
 
treeSum :: (Num a) =&gt; TreeAlgebra a a -- an f-algebra, which works  for any number type 
treeSum = (id, (+))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== General case ===
Deeper category theoretical studies of initial algebras reveal that the F-algebra obtained from applying the functor to its own initial algebra is isomorphic to it.

Strong type systems enable us to abstractly specify the initial algebra of a functor &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; as its fixed point ''a = f a''. The recursively defined catamorphisms can now be coded in single line, where the case analysis (like in the different examples above) is encapsulated by the fmap. Since the domain of the latter are objects in the image of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, the evaluation of the catamorphisms jumps back and forth between &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;f a&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
type Algebra f a = f a -&gt; a -- the generic f-algebras

newtype Fix f = Iso { invIso :: f (Fix f) } -- gives us the initial algebra for the functor f

cata :: Functor f =&gt; Algebra f a -&gt; (Fix f -&gt; a) -- catamorphism from Fix f to a
cata alg = alg . fmap (cata alg) . invIso -- note that invIso and alg map in opposite directions
&lt;/source&gt;

Now again the first example, but now via passing the Maybe functor to Fix. Repeated application of the Maybe functor generates a chain of types, which, however, can be united by the isomorphism from the fixed point theorem. We introduce the term &lt;code&gt;zero&lt;/code&gt;, which arises from Maybes's &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; and identify a successor function with repeated application of the &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;. This way the natural numbers arise.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
type Nat = Fix Maybe
zero :: Nat
zero = Iso Nothing -- every 'Maybe a' has a term Nothing, and Iso maps it into a
successor :: Nat -&gt; Nat
successor = Iso . Just -- Just maps a to 'Maybe a' and Iso maps back to a new term
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
pleaseWait :: Algebra Maybe String -- again the silly f-algebra example from above
pleaseWait (Just string) = "wait.. " ++ string
pleaseWait Nothing = "go!"
&lt;/source&gt;

Again, the following will evaluate to "wait.. wait.. wait.. wait.. go!": &lt;code&gt;cata pleaseWait (successor.successor.successor.successor $ zero)&lt;/code&gt;

And now again the tree example. For this we must provide the tree container data type so that we can set up the &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; (we didn't have to do it for the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; functor, as it's part of the standard prelude).

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Tcon a b = TconL a | TconR b b
instance Functor (Tcon a) where
    fmap f (TconL x)   = TconL x
    fmap f (TconR y z) = TconR (f y) (f z)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
type Tree a = Fix (Tcon a) -- the initial algebra
end :: a -&gt; Tree a
end = Iso . TconL
meet :: Tree a -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree a
meet l r = Iso $ TconR l r
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
treeDepth :: Algebra (Tcon a) Integer -- again, the treeDepth f-algebra example
treeDepth (TconL x)   = 1
treeDepth (TconR y z) = 1 + max y z
&lt;/source&gt;

The following will evaluate to 4: &lt;code&gt;cata treeDepth $ meet (end "X") (meet (meet (end "YXX") (end "YXY")) (end "YY"))&lt;/code&gt;

'''''Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Nathaniel Jennison''''' was a decisive [[court case]] in [[Massachusetts]] in 1783 which effectively [[abolitionism in the United States|abolished slavery]] in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bPvq0-taGAEC |page=74 |title=Founding the Republic |author=John J. Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: the commonwealth's legis;lature never passed a law abolishing slavery and slavery remained technically legal until the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] abolished slavery in all the states in 1865.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the third in a series of cases which became known as the ''Quok Walker cases''.

Nathaniel Jennison was arrested for beating [[Quock Walker]] and indicted on a criminal charge of [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] in September 1781.  The trial before the [[Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts]] was held in April 1783.  Jennison's defense was that Walker was a [[runaway slave]] but Walker countered that the [[Massachusetts Constitution#Part the First: A Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Constitution]] had made slavery illegal in 1780.  Chief Justice [[William Cushing]] accepted this argument and directed the jury that the issue of whether Walker had been freed or not was irrelevant because slavery was no longer constitutional.  The jury convicted Jennison who was fined forty [[shilling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was not widely publicized but it made it clear that the law would not defend the property rights of slave-owners.  Slavery (or the willingness to reveal its presence) declined so that, by the time of the 1790 census, no slaves were recorded in this state.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t3SDQgfxsCIC |page=17 |title=A necessary evil?: slavery and the debate over the Constitution |author=John P.

'''[[Authentication]]''' is the act of confirming the truth of an attribute of a single piece of data (a datum) claimed true by an entity. Out of different types of authentication '''[[two-factor authentication]]''' is a method that provides identification of users by means of the combination of two different components. There are number of [[two-factor authentication]] and [[multi-factor authentication]] methods. Multi-factor authentication products can provide significant benefits to an enterprise, but the methods are complex and the tools themselves can vary greatly from provider to provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/The-fundamentals-of-MFA-Comparing-the-top-multifactor-authentication-products|title=Comparing the top multifactor authentication vendors|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend ==
The term ''[[phishing]]'' refers to attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money), often for malicious reasons, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.

''[[Malware]]'', short for malicious software, is any software used to disrupt computer operations, gather sensitive information, gain access to private computer systems, or display unwanted advertising.

''Password guessing'' refers to cracking a password,  which is the process of recovering passwords illegally from data that have been stored in or transmitted by a computer system.

A ''[[man-in-the-middle attack]]'' (often abbreviated to ''MITM'', ''MitM'', ''MIM'', ''MiM attack'' or ''MITMA'') is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other

''Server side data breaking'' refers to  an incident in which sensitive, protected or confidential data has potentially been viewed, stolen from servers or used by an individual unauthorized to do so.

''[[Shoulder surfing (computer security)|Shoulder surfing]]'' refers to using direct observation techniques, such as looking over someone's shoulder, to get information. It is commonly used to obtain passwords, PINs, security codes, and similar data.

''One-time password (OTP) interception'' refers to a service provider sending a one time password to user's contact (SMS, E-mail, etc.) for authentication purpose, but that doesn't reach the user, possibly intercepted by a fraudulent person.

''Side channel vulnerabilities'' allow attackers to infer potentially sensitive information just by observing normal behavior of a software system. The attacker is a passive observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.owasp.org/images/c/cd/Side_Channel_Vulnerabilities.pdf|title=Side Channel Vulnerabilities on the Web - Detection and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''hardware token'' is an authenticator in the form of a physical object, where the user's interaction with a login system proves that the user physically possesses the object. Proving possession of the token may involve one of several techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hitachi-id.com/concepts/hardware_token.html|title=Definition of Hardware Token}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[software token]]'' is a type of two-factor authentication security device that may be used to authorize the use of computer services. Software tokens are stored on a general-purpose electronic device such as a desktop computer, laptop, PDA, or mobile phone and can be duplicated. This is in contrast to hardware tokens, where the credentials are stored on a dedicated hardware device and therefore cannot be duplicated (absent physical invasion of the device).

''TOTP'' - Time-based one-time password

''EOTP'' - Event-based one-time password

''[[Mutual authentication]]'' or two-way authentication refers to two parties authenticating each other at the same time, being a default mode of authentication in some protocols (IKE, SSH) and optional in others (TLS).

''Biometric authentication'' is a type of system that relies on the unique biological characteristics of individuals to verify identity for secure access to electronic systems.

''Scalability'' is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged in order to accommodate that growth.

''Transaction signing'' is a term used in internet banking that requires customers to digitally "sign" transactions in order to preserve the authenticity and integrity of the online transaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6073">In computing, a [[distributed file system]] (DFS) or network file system is any [[file system]] that allows access to [[computer file|files]] from multiple hosts [[resource sharing|sharing]] via a [[computer network]]. This makes it possible for multiple users on multiple machines to share files and storage resources.

Distributed file systems differ in their performance, mutability of content, handling of concurrent writes, handling of permanent or temporary loss of nodes or storage, and their policy of storing content.

==Comparison==
Some researchers have made a functional and experimental analysis of several distributed file systems including HDFS, Ceph, Gluster, Lustre and old (1.6.x) version of MooseFS, although this document is over 4 years old and a lot of information may be outdated (e.g. MooseFS has at the time of writing this stable 2.0 and beta 3.0 version and HA for Metadata Server - since 2.0 and it is not mentioned in this document).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Séguin|first1=Cyril|last2=Depardon|first2=Benjamin|last3=Le Mahec|first3=Gaël|title=Analysis of Six Distributed File Systems|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/789086/filename/a_survey_of_dfs.pdf|website=HAL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloud based remote distributed storage from major vendors have different APIs and different consistency models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Consistency Models of Public Cloud Storage Services: Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage and Windows Azure Storage|url=https://www.systutorials.com/3551/data-consistency-models-of-public-cloud-storage-services-amazon-s3-google-cloud-storage-and-windows-azure-storage/|website=SysTutorials|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a '''comparison of version control software'''. The following tables include general and technical information on notable [[version control]] and [[software configuration management]] (SCM) [[software]].  For SCM software not suitable for [[source code]], see [[Comparison of open source configuration management software]].

== General information ==
'''Table explanation'''
*''Repository model'' describes the relationship between various copies of the [[source code repository]]. In a [[client–server model]], users access a master repository via a [[Client (computing)|client]]; typically, their local machines hold only a working copy of a project tree. Changes in one working copy must be committed to the master repository before they are propagated to other users. In a [[Distributed version control|distributed]] model, repositories act as peers, and users typically have a local repository with version history available, in addition to their working copies.
*''Concurrency model'' describes how changes to the working copy are managed to prevent simultaneous edits from causing nonsensical data in the repository. In a ''lock'' model, changes are disallowed until the user requests and receives an [[readers–writer lock | exclusive lock]] on the file from the master repository. In a ''merge'' model, users may freely edit files, but are informed of possible conflicts upon checking their changes into the repository, whereupon the version control system may [[merge (version control) | merge changes]] on both sides, or let the user decide when [[edit conflict | conflicts]] arise. Note that distributed version control almost always implies a merge concurrency model.

However, ClearCase development usually takes place on private branches where each developer is given their own branch, so the lock vs. merge concurrency model doesn't matter as much. Code is merged back to the main branch once the developer is ready to deliver their code to the project.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical information ==

'''Table explanation'''
* ''Software'': The name of the application that is described.
* ''Programming language'': The coding language in which the application is being developed
* ''Storage Method'': Describes the form in which files are stored in the repository. A ''snapshot'' indicates that a committed file(s) is stored in its entirety—usually compressed.  A ''[[changeset]]'', in this context, indicates that a committed file(s) is stored in the form of a difference between either the previous version or the next.
* ''Scope of change'': Describes whether changes are recorded for individual ''files'' or for entire directory ''trees''.
* ''&lt;span id="Revision IDs"&gt;Revision IDs&lt;/span&gt;'': are used internally to identify specific versions of files in the repository. Systems may use ''[[pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]]'' identifiers, content hashes of revisions, or filenames with sequential version numbers (''namespace'').  With Integrated Difference, revisions are based on the Changesets themselves, which can describe changes to more than one file.
* ''Network protocols'': lists the [[protocol (computing)|protocols]] used for [[data synchronization | synchronization of changes]].
* ''Source code size'': Gives the size of the source code in megabytes.

== Features ==

'''Table explanation'''
* ''Software'': The name of the application that is described.
* ''[[Atomic commit]]s'': refers to a guarantee that all changes are made, or that no change at all will be made.
* ''File renames'': describes whether a system allows files to be renamed while retaining their version history.
* ''Merge file renames'': describes whether a system can merge changes made to a file on one branch into the same file that has been renamed on another branch (or vice versa). If the same file has been renamed on both branches then there is a rename conflict that the user must resolve.
* ''[[Symbolic link]]s'': describes whether a system allows revision control of symbolic links as with regular files.  Versioning symbolic links is considered by some people a feature and some people a security breach (e.g., a symbolic link to /etc/passwd). Symbolic links are only supported on select platforms, depending on the software.
* ''Pre-/post-event hooks'': indicates the capability to trigger commands before or after an action, such as a commit, takes place.
* ''[[digital signature|Signed]] revisions'': refers to integrated digital signing of revisions, in a format such as [[OpenPGP]].
* ''Merge tracking'': describes whether a system remembers what changes have been merged between which branches and only merges the changes that are missing when merging one branch into another.
* ''[[End of line]] conversions'': describes whether a system can adapt the end of line characters for text files such that they match the end of line style for the operating system under which it is used.  The granularity of control varies.  Subversion, for example, can be configured to handle EOLs differently according to the file type, whereas Perforce converts all text files according to a single, per-client setting.
* ''[[revision tag|Tags]]'': indicates if meaningful names can be given to specific revisions, regardless of whether these names are called tags or labels.
* ''International support'': indicates if the software has support for multiple language environments and operating system
* ''Unicode filename support'': indicates if the software has support for interoperations under [[file system]]s using different [[character encoding]]s.
* ''Supports large repos'': Can the system handle repositories of around a gigabyte or larger effectively?

| {{partial}}&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In Subversion, tags are a special case of the more generic "cheap copy" concept of Subversion. Per convention, a tag is a copy into a directory named "tags". Because of this, even tags are versioned. See http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.branchmerge.tags.html for more information. The reason for partial support in the table is because Subversion's emulation of tags in this manner does not meet the requirement that the tag name can be used in place of any revision identifier wherever the user may be required to enter one. This column would be meaningless if the definition were to be loosened enough to encompass Subversion's approach as every version control system supports branching and would therefore support tags as well.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advanced features ==

'''Table explanation'''
* ''keyword expansion'': supports automatic expansion of keywords such as file revision number.
* ''interactive commits'': interactive commits allow the user to cherrypick common lines of code used to anchor files (patch-hunks) that become part of a commit (leaving unselected changes as changes in the working copy), instead of having only a file-level granularity.
* ''external references'': embedding of foreign repositories in the source tree
* ''partial checkout/clone'': ability to check out or clone only a specified subdirectory from a repository.
* ''permissions'': tracks file permission bits in the revision history.
* ''[[timestamp]] preservation'': overwrites the ''last modified'' filesystem attribute with the commit time upon checkout.
* ''custom automatic merge tool'': automatic merging can be attempted by any tool of the user's choice (hopefully configurable on a per-file basis)
* ''supported formats'': either read/write support or read-only (conversion, potentially repeated)
* ''shared build cache of derived objects'': the ability to automatically substitute (wink-in) derived-objects that were built by other confederated clients that share exactly the same dependencies instead of rebuilding them locally

* ''local branches'': Create a local branch that does not exist in the original remote repository
* ''checkout'': Create a local working copy from a (remote) repository
* ''update'': Update the files in a working copy with the latest version from a repository
* ''lock'': Lock files in a repository from being changed by other users
* ''add'': Mark specified files to be added to repository at next commit

== Advanced commands ==

'''Table explanation'''
* Commands in green rectangles that are not surrounded by [square brackets] are at an interactive command-line prompt.  Text in [square brackets] is an explanation of where to find equivalent functionality.
* ''command aliases'': create custom aliases for specific commands or combination thereof
* ''lock/unlock'': exclusively lock a file to prevent others from editing it
* ''shelve/unshelve'': temporarily set aside part or all of the changes in the working directory
* ''rollback'': remove a patch/revision from history
* ''cherry-picking'': move only some revisions from a branch to another one (instead of merging the branches)
* ''bisect'': binary search of source history for a change that introduced or fixed a regression
* '' incoming/outgoing'': query the differences between the local repository and a remote one (the patches that would be fetched/sent on a pull/push)
* ''grep'': search repository for lines matching a pattern
* ''record'': include only some changes to a file in a commit and not others

== User interfaces ==

'''Table explanation'''
* ''Software'': The name of the application that is described.
* ''Web Interface'': Describes whether the software application contains a web interface. A web interface could allow the software to post diagnostics data to a website, or could even allow remote control of the software application.
* ''GUIs'': A GUI is a graphical user interface. If a software product features a GUI its functionality can be accessed through application windows as opposed to accessing functionality based upon typing commands at the command prompt such as a DOS interface.
* ''Plug-ins'': functionality is available through an Integrated Development Environment. Minimum functionality should be to list the revision state of a file and check in/check out files.

== History and adoption ==

'''Table explanation'''
* ''Software'': The name of the application that is described.

[[File:Constable's Miscellany vol XXXVI.jpg|thumb|''Constable's Miscellany'' volume XXXVI, engraving by [[William Miller (engraver)|William Miller]]]]
'''''Constable's Miscellany''''' was a part publishing serial established by [[Archibald Constable]]. Three numbers made up a volume; many of the works were divided into several volumes. The price of a number was one [[shilling]].&lt;ref name="GH"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[William Goodhugh]]|title=The English gentleman's library manual: or, A guide to the formation of a library of select literature; accompanied with original notices, biographical and critical, of authors and books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nww2AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA109|accessdate=26 September 2013|year=1827|publisher=W. Goodhugh|pages=107–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full series title was ''Constable's Miscellany of Original and Selected Publications, in the Various Departments of Literature, Science, and the Arts.''

Archibald Constable died in 1827, and the ''Miscellany'' was taken over by a consortium of Aitken, Henry Constable, and a London publisher. When the publisher went bankrupt in 1831, the project became relatively dormant.&lt;ref name="JA"/&gt; The entire list was later advertised by the London firm of Whittaker &amp; Co.&lt;ref name="Trollope1838"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frances Milton Trollope|title=One Fault: A Novel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7M8AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP18|accessdate=26 September 2013|year=1838|publisher=Richard Bentley|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Athenaeum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWtIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA816|accessdate=27 September 2013|year=1832|publisher=J.

==Background and influence==
Projected before the [[Panic of 1825]], the ''Miscellany'' was dedicated to [[George IV of the United Kingdom]], a privilege gained for Constable by [[Walter Scott]]. The initial plans were more ambitious; Constable himself became bankrupt in 1827, and this final project proceeded under constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=6101|title=Constable, Archibald|first=David|last=Hewitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Miscellany's'' first editor was [[John Aitken (editor)|John Aitken]].&lt;ref name="JA"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Aitken, John|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a series of less expensive contemporary non-fiction books for a popular audience, by a commercial publisher, it was the precedent for ''[[Murray's Family Library]]'', which it anticipated by two years.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Bennett, ''John Murray's Family Library and the Cheapening of Books in Early Nineteenth Century Britain'', Studies in Bibliography Vol. 29, (1976), pp. 139-166, at p. 141. Published by: Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40371632&lt;/ref&gt; It was recognised in the new genre, of "libraries of useful knowledge".&lt;ref name="GH"/&gt;

Constable's project is recognised as initiating a publishing phenomenon of the later 1820s. Cheap editions marketed as small libraries were seen also in the ''[[Library of Useful Knowledge]]'', ''[[Library of Entertaining Knowledge]]'', ''[[Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopædia]]'', and series by [[Henry Colburn]] and [[Abraham John Valpy]].&lt;ref name="Gettmann2010"/&gt;

{{Roman Catholic Mariology}}
'''''Deiparae Virginis Mariae''''' (1 May 1946) is an [[encyclical]] of [[Pope Pius XII]] to all Catholic bishops on the possibility of defining the [[Assumption of the Blessed Virgin]] Mary as a dogma of faith.&lt;ref&gt;McNally, Terrence, ''What Every Catholic Should Know about Mary'' {{ISBN|1-4415-1051-6}} page 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Catholic Almanac's Guide to the Church'' by Matthew Bunson 2001 {{ISBN|0-87973-914-2}} page 111&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclical states that for a long time numerous petitions have been received  from cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, priests, religious of both sexes, associations, universities and innumerable private persons, all begging that the bodily Assumption into heaven of the Blessed Virgin should be defined and proclaimed as a [[dogma]] of faith. This was also fervently requested by almost two hundred fathers in the [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] (1869–1870).

Following the example of [[Pope Pius IX]], who with his encyclical [[Ubi primum (Pius IX, 1849)|Ubi Primum]] canvassed Catholic bishops before proclaiming the dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]], Pius XII  asks all bishops for their opinion.

:We earnestly beg you to inform us about the devotion of your clergy and people (taking into account their faith and piety) toward the Assumption of the most Blessed Virgin Mary. More especially We wish to know if you, Venerable Brethren, with your learning and prudence consider that the bodily Assumption of the Immaculate Blessed Virgin can be proposed and defined as a dogma of faith, and whether in addition to your own wishes this is desired by your clergy and people.&lt;ref&gt;Deiparae Virginis Mariae 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dolmabahçe Palace''' ({{lang-tr|Dolmabahçe Sarayı}}, {{IPA-tr|doɫmabahˈtʃe saɾaˈjɯ|IPA}}) located in the [[Beşiktaş]] district of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], on the [[Europe]]an coast of the [[Bosphorus]], served as the main administrative center of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1856 to 1887 and 1909 to 1922 ([[Yıldız Palace]] was used in the interim).

== History ==
[[File:Sultan Abdülmecid I.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abdülmecid I]]]]
[[File:Dolmabahce, Istanbul, Turchia.JPG|thumb|right|Facade of the ''Selamlık'']]
Dolmabahçe Palace was ordered by the Empire's 31st Sultan, [[Abdülmecid I]], and built between the years 1843 and 1856. Previously, the Sultan and his family had lived at the [[Topkapı Palace]], but as the medieval Topkapı was lacking in contemporary style, luxury, and comfort, as compared to the palaces of the European monarchs, Abdülmecid decided to build a new modern palace near the site of the former Beşiktaş Sahil Palace, which was demolished. Hacı Said Ağa was responsible for the construction works, while the project was realized by architects [[Garabet Balyan]], his son [[Nigoğayos Balyan]] and Evanis Kalfa (members of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Balyan family]] of Ottoman court architects).

The construction cost five million [[Ottoman lira|Ottoman gold lira]], or 35 [[tonne]]s of [[gold]], the equivalent of ca. $1.5 billion in today's (2013) values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dolmabahcepalace.com/listingview.php?listingID=3&amp;name=Dolmabahce+Palace Dolmabahce Palace]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldgrambars.com/ Goldgrambars.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This sum corresponded to approximately a quarter of the yearly tax revenue. Actually, the construction was financed through [[debasement]], by massive issue of paper money, as well as by foreign loans. The huge expenses placed an enormous burden on the state purse and contributed to the deteriorating financial situation of the Ottoman Empire, which eventually [[sovereign default|defaulted]] on its [[Ottoman public debt|public debt]] in [[Great Eastern Crisis#Background|October 1875]], with the subsequent establishment in 1881 of [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|financial control]] over the "[[sick man of Europe]]" by the European powers.

The palace was home to six Sultans from 1856, when it was first inhabited, up until the abolition of the Caliphate in 1924: The last royal to live here was Caliph [[Abdülmecid II|Abdülmecid Efendi]]. A law that went into effect on March 3, 1924 transferred the ownership of the palace to the national heritage of the new Turkish Republic. [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey, used the palace as a presidential residence during the summers and enacted some of his most important works here. Atatürk spent the last days of his medical treatment in this palace, where he died on November 10, 1938.

Today, the palace is managed by ''Milli Saraylar Daire Başkanlığı'' (Directorate of National Palaces) responsible to the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]].{{clear}}

== Location ==
[[File:Dolmabahce Palacemm.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up view of the palace from the Bosphorus]]
The site of Dolmabahçe was originally a bay on the [[Bosphorus]] which was used for the anchorage of the Ottoman fleet. The area was reclaimed gradually during the 18th century to become an imperial garden, much appreciated by the Ottoman [[sultan]]s; it is from this garden that the name ''Dolmabahçe'' (Filled-in Garden) comes from the Turkish ''dolma'' meaning "filled" and ''bahçe'' meaning "garden." Various small summer palaces and wooden pavilions were built here during the 18th and 19th centuries ultimately forming a palace complex named Beşiktaş Waterfront Palace. The area of 110,000&amp;nbsp;m² is confined by Bosphorus on the east side, while a steep precipice bounds it on the west side, such that after the building of the new 45,000&amp;nbsp;m² monoblock Dolmabahçe Palace a relatively limited space has remained for a garden complex which would normally surround such a palace.&lt;ref name=IstanbulNet&gt;[http://www.istanbul.net.tr/istanbul_muzeler_detay.asp?id=103 Dolmabahçe Palace Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717084800/http://www.istanbul.net.tr/istanbul_muzeler_detay.asp?id=103 |date=July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CultureTourism&gt;[http://www.turizm.gov.tr/EN,113763/dolmabahce-palace.html Turkish Ministry of Tourism site about Dolmabahçe Palace]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

== Design and layout ==
[[File:Dolmabahce Sarayi.jpg|thumb|left|Fountain in the garden]]
[[File:Dolmabahce Palace plan.svg|thumb|Floor plan of the palace]]
Dolmabahçe is the largest palace in Turkey. It has an area of {{Convert|45,000|m2|acres|1|abbr = on}}, and contains 285 rooms, 46 halls, 6 baths (''[[Turkish bath|hamam]]'') and 68 toilets.&lt;ref name=IstanbulNet/&gt;&lt;ref name=CultureTourism/&gt;

The design contains [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] elements from the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], [[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] styles, blended with traditional [[Ottoman architecture]] to create a new synthesis. The palace layout and décor reflect the increasing influence of European styles and standards on [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman culture and art]] during the [[Tanzimat]] period. The exterior, in particular the view from the Bosporus, shows a classical European two-wing arrangement which is divided by a big [[avant-corps]] with two side avant-corps.

Functionally, on the other hand, the palace retains elements of traditional Ottoman palace life, and also features of traditional Turkish homes. It is strictly separated structurally in a southern wing (''Mabeyn-i Hümâyûn'', or ''Selamlık'', the quarters reserved for the men) which contains the public representation rooms, and a northern wing (''Harem-i Hümâyûn'', the [[Imperial Harem|Harem]]) serving as the private residential area for the Sultan and his family. The two functional areas are separated by the big Ceremonial Hall (''Muayede Salonu'') with a floor area of {{Convert|2000|m2|ft2|abbr = on}} and a {{Convert|36|m|ft|abbr = on}} high dome. Since the harem had to be completely isolated from the outside world, the main entrance for the visitors is located on the narrow southern side. There, the representation rooms are arranged for receptions of visitors and of foreign diplomats. The harem area includes eight interconnected apartments for the wives of the sultan, for his favourites and concubines, and for his mother, each with its own bathroom.{{clear}}

[[File:Istanbul img 5058.jpg|thumb|Sultan's hamam decorated with Egyptian alabaster]]
Whereas the Topkapı has exquisite examples of [[Iznik tiles]] and Ottoman carving, the Dolmabahçe palace is extensively decorated with gold and crystal. Fourteen tonnes of gold were used to gild the ceilings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;lng=3&amp;id=107341 Dolmabahçe Palace], Emporis&lt;/ref&gt; The world's largest [[Bohemian glass|Bohemian crystal]] [[chandelier]] is in the Ceremonial Hall. The chandelier was assumed to be a gift from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], however in 2006 the receipt was found showing it was paid for in full. It has 750 lamps and weighs 4.5 tonnes. Dolmabahçe has the largest collection of Bohemian and [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat crystal]] chandeliers in the world. The famous ''Crystal Staircase'' has the shape of a double [[horseshoe]] and is built of Baccarat crystal, [[brass]] and [[mahogany]].

Expensive stones such as [[Marmara Island|Marmara]] (Proconnesian) marble, Egyptian [[alabaster]] ([[calcite]], also known as onyx-marble), and [[Porphyry (geology)|Porphyry]] from [[Pergamon]] were used for the decoration.

The palace includes a large number of [[Hereke carpet|Hereke palace carpet]]s made by the Hereke Imperial Factory. Also featured are 150-year-old bearskin rugs originally presented to the Sultan as a gift by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]].

A collection of 202 oil paintings is on display in the palace. A highlight of the collection are 23 paintings by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] which he created as a court painter during his stays in Istanbul.&lt;ref name=Aivazovksy&gt;[http://euroasianews.com/historical-ottoman-palace-to-reopen-as-a-museum/ Historical Ottoman Palace reopens as museum], EuroAsiaNews.com, March 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The collection also includes paintings by [[Gustave Boulanger]], [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], [[Eugène Fromentin]], [[Stanisław Chlebowski]], [[Félix Ziem]], [[Karl Joseph Kuwasseg]], [[Fausto Zonaro]], [[Théo van Rysselberghe]] and Alexander Sandor Svoboda. There are also paintings by Turkish painters such as [[Osman Hamdi Bey]], [[Halil Pasha (painter)|Halil Pasha]] and [[Osman Nuri Pasha (painter)|Osman Nuri Pasha]] in this art museum.

From the very beginning, the palace's equipment implemented the highest technical standards. [[Gas lighting]] and [[water-closet]]s were imported from Great Britain, whereas the palaces in continental Europe were still lacking these features at that time. Later, electricity, a [[central heating system]] and an [[elevator]] were installed.{{clear}}

== Rooms ==

[[File:Dolmabahce Palace ced.jpg|thumb|Blue Hall]]
[[File:Dolmabahce Palacasdfe.jpg|thumb|Pink Hall]]

=== Medhal (Main Entrance) Hall ===

A visit to the Dolmabahce Palace begins at the Medhal Hall. Rooms leading off the Medhal are towards the sea and the land. The rooms facing the sea were used by the leading [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] officials, the [[Grand Vizier]] and the other state ministers, while the rooms facing the land were used by various administrators of the palace and the state, such as the Palace Marshall, [[Sheikh ul-Islam|Şeyhülislam]], and members of the House of Representatives (''Meclis-i Mebusan'') and the Senate (''Meclis-i Ayan'').

Guests would first wait in this hall and then would be led inside at the proper time by a palace protocol officer. On entering the Medhal, one sees Boulle tables on both sides of the room, which bear the [[tughra|monogram]] of Sultan Abdülmecid on top. The royal monogram of the sultan is also on the fireplace. The English chandelier hanging in the middle of this room has sixty arms. The Hereke fabrics used as upholstery for the furniture and as draperies are in the royal shade of red.

=== The secretariat's rooms ===

The second room after the Medhal to the right is the Clerk's Hall, also referred to as the ''Tiled Room.'' The largest painting in the palace collection, a depiction of the Surre Procession by [[Stefano Ussi]], hangs on the left wall of this hall. Surre was used to refer to the caravans which travelled from Istanbul to Mecca during the religious month of Recep, bearing the monetary aid used to support the maintenance and the decoration of the [[Kaaba]] and to provide financial assistance to the local population of [[Hejaz]].

[[File:Ataturk deathbed Dolmabahce March 2008.JPG|thumb|[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]]'s deathbed]]

On the wall to the right is a painting signed by [[Rudolf Ernst]] depicting the fire at the Paris Municipal Theater and another painting of a Dutch Village Girl by [[Delandre]]. Decorated with French style furniture, this room also contains very valuable porcelain vases.

=== Atatürk's room ===

[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] spent the last days of his life in the palace as his health deteriorated. He died at 9:05 A.M. on November 10, 1938, in a bedroom located in the former harem area of the palace. All the clocks in the palace were stopped and set to 9:05 after his death. The clocks outside of his room now are set to the [[Eastern European Time|actual time in Turkey]], but the clock in the room in which he died still points to 9:05.{{clear}}

A number of further residential buildings are located near the palace including the palace of the Crown Prince (''Veliaht Dairesi''), the quarters of the gentlemen-in-waiting (''Musahiban Dairesi''), the dormitories of the servants (''Agavat Dairesi'', ''Bendegan Dairesi'') and of the guards (''Baltacilar Dairesi''), the quarters of the [[Kizlar Agha|Chief Eunuch]] (''Kizlaragasi Dairesi''). Further buildings include imperial kitchens (''Matbah-i Amire''), stables, an aviary (''Kusluk''), a plant nursery (''Fidelik''), a flour mill, a greenhouse (''Sera''), a Hereke carpet workshop (''Hereke dökümhanesi''), a glass manufactory, a foundry, a pharmacy etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatistanbul.com/dolmabahce_palace.htm Dolmabahçe Palace], Great Istanbul&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archnet.org/sites/3475/media_contents/62102 Dolmabahçe Sarayi], Archnet&lt;/ref&gt;

A baroque style [[Dolmabahçe Mosque|mosque]] designed by Garabet Balyan was built near the palace in 1853—1855. It was commissioned by queen mother Bezm-i Âlem Valide Sultan. Since 1948 the building housed the Naval Museum, but the museum was moved to another location in 1960 after the [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|coup d'état of May, 27th]]. In 1967 the mosque was returned for worship.

A [[Dolmabahçe Clock Tower|clock tower]] (''Dolmabahçe Saat Kulesi'') was erected in front of the Imperial Gate (Saltanat Kapisi) on a square along the European waterfront of Bosphorus next to the mosque. The tower was ordered by Sultan [[Abdülhamid II]] and designed by the court architect [[Sarkis Balyan]] between 1890 and 1895. Its clock was manufactured by the French clockmaker house of Jean-Paul Garnier, and installed by the court clock master Johann Mayer.{{clear}}

The '''Domain Name System Security Extensions''' ('''DNSSEC''') is a suite of [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) specifications for securing certain kinds of information provided by the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) as used on [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) networks.  It is a set of extensions to DNS which provide to DNS clients (resolvers) [[message authentication|origin authentication]] of DNS data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality.

==Overview==
The original design of the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) did not include any security details; instead, it was designed to be a scalable distributed system. The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) attempts to add security, while maintaining [[backward compatibility]].  RFC 3833 documents some of the known threats to the DNS and how DNSSEC responds to those threats.

DNSSEC was designed to protect applications (and caching resolvers serving those applications) from using forged or manipulated DNS data, such as that created by [[DNS cache poisoning]]. All answers from DNSSEC protected zones are [[digital signature|digitally signed]]. By checking the digital signature, a DNS resolver is able to check if the information is identical (i.e. unmodified and complete) to the information published by the zone owner and served on an authoritative DNS server. While protecting IP addresses is the immediate concern for many users, DNSSEC can protect any data published in the DNS, including text records (TXT) and mail exchange records (MX), and can be used to bootstrap other security systems that publish references to cryptographic certificates stored in the DNS such as Certificate Records ([[CERT record]]s, RFC 4398), [[Secure Shell|SSH]] fingerprints (SSHFP, RFC 4255), [[IPSec]] public keys (IPSECKEY, RFC 4025), and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] Trust Anchors (TLSA, RFC 6698).

DNSSEC ''does not'' provide confidentiality of data; in particular, all DNSSEC responses are authenticated but not encrypted. DNSSEC ''does not'' protect against [[denial of service|DoS]] attacks directly, though it indirectly provides some benefit (because signature checking allows the use of potentially untrustworthy parties; this is true only if the DNS server is using a self-signed certificate, not recommended for Internet-facing DNS servers).{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Other standards (not DNSSEC) are used to secure bulk data (such as a [[DNS zone transfer]]) sent between DNS servers. As documented in IETF RFC 4367, some users and developers make false assumptions about DNS names, such as assuming that a company's common name plus ".com" is always its domain name. DNSSEC cannot protect against false assumptions; it can only authenticate that the data is truly from or not available from the domain owner.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The DNSSEC specifications (called ''DNSSEC-bis'') describe the current DNSSEC protocol in great detail. See RFC 4033, RFC 4034, and RFC 4035. With the publication of these new RFCs (March 2005), an earlier RFC, RFC 2535 has become obsolete.

It is widely believed&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Dan Kaminsky on DNSSEC (25 Jun 2009) [http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/interview/0,289202,sid14_gci1360143,00.html Kaminsky interview: DNSSEC addresses cross-organizational trust and security]&lt;/ref&gt; that securing the DNS is critically important for securing the Internet as a whole, but deployment of DNSSEC specifically has been hampered ({{As of|2010|January|22}}) by several difficulties:
* The need to design a backward-compatible standard that can scale to the size of the Internet
* Prevention of "zone enumeration" where desired
* Deployment of DNSSEC implementations across a wide variety of DNS servers and resolvers (clients)
* Disagreement among implementers over who should own the [[top-level domain]] root keys
* Overcoming the perceived complexity of DNSSEC and DNSSEC deployment

[[Microsoft Windows]] uses a ''stub resolver''; Windows 7 and beyond in particular use a ''non-validating'' (but DNSSEC-aware) kind.&lt;ref name="windows-understanding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="windows-dnssec"/&gt; For it to place any real reliance on DNSSEC services, this stub resolver must trust both the ''recursive name servers'' in question (which is usually controlled by the [[Internet service provider|ISP]]) and the communication channels between itself and those name servers, using methods such as IPsec (use of which is{{When|date=October 2013}} not widespread),&lt;ref name="practical-ipsec"/&gt; SIG(0), or [[TSIG]].&lt;ref name="rfc4033_p12"/&gt;

==Operation==
{{More footnotes|section|date=October 2018}}
DNSSEC works by [[digital signature|digitally signing]] records for DNS lookup using [[public-key cryptography]]. The correct DNSKEY record is authenticated via a [[chain of trust]], starting with a set of verified public keys for the [[DNS root zone]] which is the [[trusted third party]]. Domain owners generate their own keys, and upload them using their DNS control panel at their domain-name registrar, which in turn pushes the keys via secDNS to the zone operator (e.g., Verisign for .com) who signs and publishes them in DNS.

===Resource records===
DNS is implemented by the use of several resource records. To implement DNSSEC, several new [[list of DNS record types|DNS record types]] were created or adapted to use with DNSSEC:
;RRSIG (resource record signature): Contains the DNSSEC signature for a record set. DNS resolvers verify the signature with a public key, stored in a DNSKEY record.
;DNSKEY: Contains the public key that a DNS resolver uses to verify DNSSEC signatures in RRSIG records.
;DS (delegation signer): Holds the name of a delegated zone. References a DNSKEY record in the sub-delegated zone. The DS record is placed in the parent zone along with the delegating NS records.
;NSEC (next secure record): Contains a link to the next record name in the zone and lists the record types that exist for the record's name. DNS resolvers use NSEC records to verify the non-existence of a record name and type as part of DNSSEC validation.
;NSEC3 (next secure record version 3): Contains links to the next record name in the zone (in hashed name sorting order) and lists the record types that exist for the name covered by the hash value in the first label of the NSEC3 record's own name. These records can be used by resolvers to verify the non-existence of a record name and type as part of DNSSEC validation. NSEC3 records are similar to NSEC records, but NSEC3 uses cryptographically hashed record names to avoid the enumeration of the record names in a zone.
;NSEC3PARAM (next secure record version 3 parameters): Authoritative DNS servers use this record to calculate and determine which NSEC3 records to include in responses to DNSSEC requests for non-existing names/types.

When DNSSEC is used, each answer to a DNS lookup contains an RRSIG DNS record, in addition to the record type that was requested.  The RRSIG record is a digital signature of the answer [[DNS]] resource record set. The digital signature is verified by locating the correct public key found in a DNSKEY record. The NSEC and NSEC3 records are used to provide cryptographic evidence of the non-existence of any RR. The DS record is used in the authentication of DNSKEYs in the lookup procedure using the chain of trust. NSEC and NSEC3 records are used for robust resistance against spoofing.

====Algorithms====

DNSSEC was designed to be extensible so that as attacks are discovered against existing algorithms, new ones can be introduced in a [[backward-compatible]] fashion. The following table defines, as of April 2013, the security algorithms that are most often used:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===The lookup procedure===
From the results of a DNS lookup, a security-aware [[DNS resolver]] can determine whether the [[authoritative name server]] for the domain being queried supports DNSSEC, whether the answer it receives is secure, and whether there is some sort of error. The lookup procedure is different for [[Domain Name System#Recursive and caching name server|recursive name servers]] such as those of many [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s, and for [[stub resolver]]s such as those included by default in mainstream operating systems. [[Microsoft Windows]] uses a stub resolver, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 in particular use a non-validating but DNSSEC-aware stub resolver.&lt;ref name="windows-understanding"&gt;{{cite web | title= Understanding DNSSEC in Windows | publisher= [[Microsoft]] | date= October 7, 2009 | url= https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee649277(WS.10).aspx | quote= The Windows DNS client is a stub resolver...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="windows-dnssec"&gt;{{cite web | title= DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) | publisher= [[Microsoft]] | date= October 21, 2009 | url= https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee683904(WS.10).aspx | quote= The DNS client in Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows® 7 is a non-validating security-aware stub resolver.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recursive name servers====
Using the [[chain of trust]] model, a Delegation Signer (DS) record in a parent domain ([[DNS zone]]) can be used to verify a DNSKEY record in a [[subdomain]], which can then contain other DS records to verify further subdomains. Say that a recursive resolver such as an ISP name server wants to get the IP addresses ([[A record]] and/or [[AAAA record]]s) of the domain "www.[[example.com]]".

# The process starts when a security-aware resolver sets the "DO" ("DNSSEC OK"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conrad|first1=D.|title=Indicating Resolver Support of DNSSEC|url=https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3225.txt|website=Internet Engineering Task Force|accessdate=27 April 2017|ref=3. Protocol Changes}}&lt;/ref&gt;) flag bit in a DNS query. Since the DO bit is in the extended flag bits defined by [[EDNS]], all DNSSEC transactions must support EDNS. EDNS support is also needed to allow for the much larger packet sizes that DNSSEC transactions require.
# When the resolver receives an answer via the normal DNS lookup process, it then checks to make sure that the answer is correct. Ideally, the security-aware resolver would start with verifying the DS and DNSKEY records at the [[DNS root]]. Then it would use the DS records for the "com" [[top level domain]] found at the root to verify the DNSKEY records in the "com" zone. From there, it would see if there is a DS record for the "example.com" subdomain in the "com" zone, and if there were, it would then use the DS record to verify a DNSKEY record found in the "example.com" zone. Finally, it would verify the RRSIG record found in the answer for the A records for "www.example.com".

There are several exceptions to the above example.

First, if "example.com" does not support DNSSEC, there will be no RRSIG record in the answer and there will not be a DS record for "example.com" in the "com" zone.  If there is a DS record for "example.com", but no RRSIG record in the reply, something is wrong and maybe a [[man in the middle attack]] is going on, stripping the DNSSEC information and modifying the A records.  Or, it could be a broken security-oblivious name server along the way that stripped the DO flag bit from the query or the RRSIG record from the answer.  Or, it could be a configuration error.

Next, it may be that there is not a domain name named "www.example.com", in which case instead of returning a RRSIG record in the answer, there will be either an NSEC record or an NSEC3 record.  These are "next secure" records that allow the resolver to prove that a domain name does not exist.  The NSEC/NSEC3 records have RRSIG records, which can be verified as above.

Finally, it may be that the "example.com" zone implements DNSSEC, but either the "com" zone or the root zone do not, creating an "island of security" which needs to be validated in some other way. {{as of|2010|7|15}}, deployment of DNSSEC to root is completed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.root-dnssec.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The .com domain was signed with valid security keys and the secure delegation was added to the root zone on 1 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2039287/verisign-adds-dnssec-com-domain-boost-online-security/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stub resolvers====
Stub resolvers are "minimal DNS resolvers that use recursive query mode to offload most of the work of DNS resolution to a recursive name server."&lt;ref name="rfc4033_section7"&gt;
  {{Cite journal

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; A stub resolver will simply forward a request to a recursive name server, and use the Authenticated Data (AD) bit in the response as a "hint to find out whether the recursive name server was able to validate signatures for all of the data in the Answer and Authority sections of the response."&lt;ref name="rfc4033_p12"/&gt; [[Microsoft Windows]] uses a stub resolver, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 in particular use a non-validating but AD-bit-aware stub resolver.&lt;ref name="windows-understanding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="windows-dnssec"/&gt;

A ''validating stub resolver'' can also potentially perform its own signature validation by setting the Checking Disabled (CD) bit in its query messages.&lt;ref name="rfc4033_p12"/&gt; A validating stub resolver uses the CD bit to perform its own recursive authentication. Using such a validating stub resolver gives the client end-to-end DNS security for domains implementing DNSSEC, even if the Internet service provider or the connection to them is not trusted.

For the non-validating stub resolver to place any real reliance on DNSSEC services, the stub resolver must trust both the recursive name servers in question (which is usually controlled by the [[Internet service provider]]) and the communication channels between itself and those name servers, using methods such as [[IPsec]], SIG(0), or TSIG.&lt;ref name="rfc4033_p12"&gt;{{Cite journal | title= RFC 4033: DNS Security Introduction and Requirements | publisher= [[The Internet Society]] | date= March 2005 | page= 12 | url= http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033#page-12 | postscript= . }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of IPsec is not widespread.&lt;ref name="practical-ipsec"&gt;{{cite book | title= Enabling Practical IPsec Authentication for the Internet | first1= Pedro J. | last1= Muñoz Merino | first2= Alberto | last2= García-Martínez | first3= Mario Muñoz | last3= Organero | first4= Carlos Delgado | last4= Kloos | year= 2006 | series= On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems 2006: OTM 2006 Workshops | volume= 1 | editor1-first= Robert | editor1-last= Meersman | editor2-first= Zahir | editor2-last= Tari | editor3-first= Herrero Martín | editor3-last= Herrero | publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | url= http://netcom.it.uc3m.es/publications/pdf/2006/fulltext.pdf | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120426065241/http://netcom.it.uc3m.es/publications/pdf/2006/fulltext.pdf | archivedate= 2012-04-26 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trust anchors and authentication chains===
To be able to prove that a DNS answer is correct, one needs to know at least one key or DS record that is correct from sources other than the DNS.  These starting points are known as '''trust anchors''' and are typically obtained with the [[operating system]] or via some other trusted source.  When DNSSEC was originally designed, it was thought that the only trust anchor that would be needed was for the [[DNS root]]. The root anchors were first published on 15 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/ root-anchors]&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''[[authentication]] chain'' is a series of linked DS and DNSKEY records, starting with a [[trust anchor]] to the [[authoritative name server]] for the domain in question.  Without a complete authentication chain, an answer to a DNS lookup cannot be securely authenticated.

===Signatures and zone signing===
To limit replay attacks, there are not only the normal DNS TTL values for caching purposes, but additional timestamps in RRSIG records to limit the validity of a signature. Unlike TTL values which are relative to when the records were sent, the timestamps are absolute.  This means that all security-aware DNS resolvers must have clocks that are fairly closely in sync, say to within a few minutes.

These timestamps imply that a zone must regularly be re-signed and re-distributed to secondary servers, or the signatures will be rejected by validating resolvers.

===Key management===
DNSSEC involves many different keys, stored both in DNSKEY records, and from other sources to form [[trust anchor]]s.

In order to allow for replacement keys, a '''key rollover''' scheme is required.  Typically, this involves first rolling out new keys in new DNSKEY records, in addition to the existing old keys.  Then, when it is safe to assume that the [[time to live]] values have caused the caching of old keys to have passed, these new keys can be used.  Finally, when it is safe to assume that the caching of records using the old keys have expired, the old DNSKEY records can be deleted.   This process is more complicated for things such as the keys to trust anchors, such as at the root, which may require an update of the operating system.

Keys in DNSKEY records can be used for two different things and typically different DNSKEY records are used for each.  First, there are '''key signing keys''' (KSK) which are used to sign other DNSKEY records.  Second, there are '''zone signing keys''' (ZSK) which are used to sign other records.  Since the ZSKs are under complete control and use by one particular [[DNS zone]], they can be switched more easily and more often.  As a result, ZSKs can be much shorter than KSKs and still offer the same level of protection while reducing the size of the RRSIG/DNSKEY records.

When a new KSK is created, the DS record must be transferred to the parent zone and published there.  The DS records use a [[message digest]] of the KSK instead of the complete key in order to keep the size of the records small.  This is helpful for zones such as the [[.com]] domain, which are very large.  The procedure to update DS keys in the parent zone is also simpler than earlier DNSSEC versions that required DNSKEY records to be in the parent zone.

===DANE Working Group===
[[DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities]] (DANE) is an IETF working group&lt;ref&gt;[https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dane/charter/ IETF: DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (dane)]&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of developing protocols and techniques that allow Internet applications to establish cryptographically secured communications with [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]], [[DTLS]], [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], and [[S/MIME]] based on DNSSEC.

The new protocols will enable additional assurances and constraints for the traditional model based on [[public key infrastructure]]. They will also enable domain holders to assert certificates for themselves, without reference to third-party [[certificate authority|certificate authorities]].

Support for DNSSEC stapled certificates was enabled in [[Google Chrome]] 14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/06/16/dnssecchrome.html|title=ImperialViolet|accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=chromium/chromium.git;a=commit;h=6a7172345e72d755d99c095eb3d4768f0f585344|title=chromium git|accessdate=2013-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Mozilla Firefox]], support is provided by an add-on&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dnssec-validator.cz/|title=DNSSEC/TLSA Validator}}&lt;/ref&gt; while native support is currently awaiting someone to start working on it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=672600 Bugzilla@Mozilla: Bug 672600 - Use DNSSEC/DANE chain stapled into TLS handshake in certificate chain validation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
DNS is a critical and fundamental Internet service, yet in 1990 [[Steve Bellovin]] discovered serious security flaws in it. Research into securing it began, and progressed dramatically when his paper was made public in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/bellovin95using.html "Using the Domain Name System for System Break-Ins"] by Steve Bellovin, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  The initial RFC 2065 was published by the IETF in 1997, and initial attempts to implement that specification led to a revised (and believed fully workable) specification in 1999 as IETF RFC 2535.  Plans were made to deploy DNSSEC based on RFC 2535.

Unfortunately, the IETF RFC 2535 specification had very significant problems scaling up to the full Internet; by 2001 it became clear that this specification was unusable for large networks. In normal operation DNS servers often get out of sync with their parents. This isn't usually a problem, but when DNSSEC is enabled, this out-of-sync data could have the effect of a serious self-created denial of service.  The original DNSSEC required a complex six-message protocol and a lot of data transfers to perform key changes for a child (DNS child zones had to send all of their data up to the parent, have the parent sign each record, and then send those signatures back to the child for the child to store in a SIG record).  Also, public key changes could have absurd effects; for example, if the ".com" zone changed its public key, it would have to send 22 million records (because it would need to update all of the signatures in all of its children).  Thus, DNSSEC as defined in RFC 2535 could not scale up to the Internet.

The IETF fundamentally modified DNSSEC, which is called ''DNSSEC-bis'' when necessary to distinguish it from the original DNSSEC approach of RFC 2535.  This new version uses "delegation signer (DS) resource records" to provide an additional level of indirection at delegation points between a parent and child zone. In the new approach, when a child's master public key changes, instead of having to have six messages for every record in the child, there is one simple message: the child sends the new public key to its parent (signed, of course). Parents simply store one master public key for each child; this is much more practical. This means that a little data is pushed to the parent, instead of massive amounts of data being exchanged between the parent and children. This does mean that clients have to do a little more work when verifying keys. More specifically, verifying a DNS zone's KEY RRset requires two signature verification operations instead of the one required by RFC 2535 (there is no impact on the number of signatures verified for other types of RRsets). Most view this as a small price to pay, since it makes DNSSEC deployment more practical.

==Authenticating NXDOMAIN responses and NSEC==
Cryptographically proving the absence of a domain requires signing the response to every query for a non-existent domain.  This is not a problem for online signing servers, which keep their keys available online.  However, DNSSEC was designed around using offline computers to sign records so that zone-signing-keys could be kept in cold storage.  This represents a problem when trying to authenticate responses to queries for non-existent domains since it is impossible to pre-generate a response to every possible hostname query.

The initial solution was to create NSEC records for every pair of domains in a zone.  Thus if a client queried for a record at the non-existent &lt;code&gt;k.example.com&lt;/code&gt;, the server would respond with an NSEC record stating that nothing exists between &lt;code&gt;a.example.com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;z.example.com&lt;/code&gt;.  However, this leaks more information about the zone than traditional unauthenticated NXDOMAIN errors because it exposes the existence of real domains.

The NSEC3 records (RFC 5155) were created as an alternative that which hashes the name instead of listing them directly.  Over time, advancements in hashing using GPUs and dedicated hardware meant that NSEC3 responses could be cheaply brute forced using offline dictionary attacks.  [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vcelak-nsec5/ NSEC5] has been proposed to allow authoritative servers to sign NSEC responses without having to keep a private key that can be used to modify the zone.  Thus stealing an NSEC5KEY would only result in the ability to more easily enumerate a zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.bu.edu/~goldbe/papers/nsec5.html|title=NSEC5: Provably Preventing DNSSEC Zone Enumeration|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the messy evolution of the protocol and a desire to preserve backwards compatibility, online DNSSEC signing servers return a "white lie" instead of authenticating a denial of existence directly. The technique outline in RFC 4470 returns a NSEC record in which the pairs of domains lexically surrounding the requested domain.  For example, request for &lt;code&gt;k.example.com&lt;/code&gt; would thus result in an NSEC record proving that nothing exists between the (fictitious) domains &lt;code&gt;j.example.com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;l.example.com&lt;/code&gt;.  CloudFlare pioneered another approach in which proves that "the record exists but the requested record type does not" that has the advantage of a significantly reduced payload size.&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.cloudflare.com/dnssec-done-right/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deployment==
The Internet is critical infrastructure, yet its operation depends on the fundamentally insecure DNS.
Thus, there is strong incentive to secure DNS, and deploying DNSSEC is generally considered to be a critical part of that effort.
For example, the U.S. ''National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace'' specifically identified the need to secure DNS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/cyberspace_strategy.pdf U.S. ''National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace''], p. 30 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
Wide-scale deployment of DNSSEC could resolve many other security problems as well, such as secure key distribution for e-mail addresses.

DNSSEC deployment in large-scale networks is also challenging. Ozment and Schechter observe that DNSSEC (and other technologies) has a "bootstrap problem": users typically only deploy a technology if they receive an immediate benefit, but if a minimal level of deployment is required before ''any'' users receive a benefit greater than their costs (as is true for DNSSEC), it is difficult to deploy. DNSSEC can be deployed at any level of a DNS hierarchy, but it must be widely available in a zone before many others will want to adopt it. DNS servers must be updated with software that supports DNSSEC, and DNSSEC data must be created and added to the DNS zone data. A TCP/IP-using client must have their DNS resolver (client) updated before it can use DNSSEC's capabilities. What is more, any resolver must have, or have a way to acquire, at least one public key that it can trust before it can start using DNSSEC.

DNSSEC implementation can add significant load to some DNS servers. Common DNSSEC-signed responses are far larger than the default UDP size of 512 bytes. In theory, this can be handled through multiple IP fragments, but many "middleboxes" in the field do not handle these correctly. This leads to the use of TCP instead. Yet many current TCP implementations store a great deal of data for each TCP connection; heavily loaded servers can run out of resources simply trying to respond to a larger number of (possibly bogus) DNSSEC requests. Some protocol extensions, such as [[TCP Cookie Transactions]], have been developed to reduce this loading.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address these challenges, significant effort is ongoing to deploy DNSSEC, because the Internet is so vital to so many organizations.

===Early deployments===
Early adopters include [[Brazil]] ([[.br]]), [[Bulgaria]] ([[.bg]]), [[Czech Republic]] ([[.cz]]), [[Namibia]] ([[.na]])&lt;ref&gt;https://ccnso.icann.org/de/node/7603&lt;/ref&gt; [[Puerto Rico]] ([[.pr]]) and [[Sweden]] ([[.se]]), who use DNSSEC for their [[country code top-level domain]]s;&lt;ref name="EPIC-20080527"&gt;Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) (May 27, 2008).

IANA publicly tested a sample signed root since June 2007. During this period prior to the production signing of the root, there were also several alternative trust anchors. The IKS Jena introduced one on January 19, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ripe.net/ripe/maillists/archives/dns-wg/2006/msg00053.html dns-wg archive: Signed zones list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305102531/http://www.ripe.net/ripe/maillists/archives/dns-wg/2006/msg00053.html |date=March 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Internet Systems Consortium]] introduced another on March 27 of the same year,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.isc.org/node/62 ISC Launches DLV registry to kick off worldwide DNSSEC deployment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118020616/https://www.isc.org/node/62 |date=November 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[ICANN]] themselves announced a third on February 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://itar.iana.org/ Interim Trust Anchor Repository]&lt;/ref&gt;

VeriSign ran a pilot project to allow .com and .net domains to register themselves for the purpose of NSEC3 experimentation. On February 24, 2009, they announced that they would deploy DNSSEC across all their top level domains (.com, .net, etc.) within 24 months,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/022409-verisign-dns-security.html?page=1 VeriSign: We will support DNS security in 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303103411/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/022409-verisign-dns-security.html?page=1 |date=March 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on November 16 of the same year, they said the .com and .net domains would be signed by the first quarter of 2011, after delays caused by technical aspects of the implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.zdnet.co.uk/security/0,1000000189,39877966,00.htm VeriSign: Major internet security update by 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; This goal was achieved on-schedule&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130123041030/http://www.esecurityplanet.com/features/article.php/3929786/com-Domain-Finally-Safe.htm .com Domain Finally Safe]&lt;/ref&gt; and Verisign's DNSSEC VP, Matt Larson, won InfoWorld's Technology Leadership Award for 2011 for his role in advancing DNSSEC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circleid.com/posts/20110601_verisign_matt_larson_wins_2011_infoworld_technology_leadership/ Verisign's Matt Larson Wins 2011 InfoWorld Technology Leadership Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoworld.com/t/information-technology-careers/the-infoworld-2011-technology-leadership-awards-959 The InfoWorld 2011 Technology Leadership Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deployment at the DNS root===
DNSSEC was first deployed at the root level on July 15, 2010.&lt;ref name="dnssec-status-live"&gt;{{cite web|title=Root DNSSEC Status Update, 2010-07-16|url=http://www.root-dnssec.org/2010/07/16/status-update-2010-07-16/|date=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expected to greatly simplify the deployment of DNSSEC resolvers, since the root trust anchor can be used to validate any DNSSEC zone that has a complete chain of trust from the root. Since the chain of trust must be traced back to a trusted root without interruption in order to validate, trust anchors must still be configured for secure zones if any of the zones above them are not secure. For example, if the zone "signed.example.org" was secured but the "example.org" zone was not, then, even though the ".org" zone and the root are signed, a trust anchor has to be deployed in order to validate the zone.

Political issues surrounding signing the root have been a continuous concern, primarily about some central issues:
* Other countries are concerned about U.S. control over the Internet, and may reject any centralized keying for this reason.
* Some governments might try to ban DNSSEC-backed encryption key distribution.

====Planning====
In September 2008, ICANN and VeriSign each published implementation proposals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Singel, Ryan|title=Feds Start Moving on Net Security Hole|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/10/feds-take-step.html|date=October 8, 2006|work=Wired News|publisher=CondéNet|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in October, the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] (NTIA) asked the public for comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Press Release: NTIA Seeks Public Comments for the Deployment of Security Technology Within the Internet Domain Name System|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/press/2008/DNSSEC_081009.html|date=October 9, 2008|publisher=National Telecommunications and Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if the comments received affected the design of the final deployment plan.

On June 3, 2009, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) announced plans to sign the root by the end of 2009, in conjunction with ICANN, [[VeriSign]] and the NTIA.&lt;ref name="NISTpr609"&gt;{{cite press release | url= https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/dnssec_060309.html | title= Commerce Department to Work with ICANN and VeriSign to Enhance the Security and Stability of the Internet's Domain Name and Addressing System | publisher= National Institute of Standards and Technology | date= 3 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2009, at the 59th [[RIPE]] Conference meeting, ICANN and VeriSign announced the planned deployment timeline for deploying DNSSEC within the root zone.&lt;ref name="conf"&gt;{{cite web | title = DNSSEC for the Root Zone | url=http://www.ripe.net/ripe/meetings/ripe-59/presentations/abley-dnssec-root-zone.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting it was announced that it would be incrementally deployed to one root name server a month, starting on December 1, 2009, with the final root name server serving a DNSSEC signed zone on July 1, 2010, and the root zone will be signed with a RSA/SHA256 DNSKEY.&lt;ref name="conf"/&gt; During the incremental roll-out period the root zone will serve a ''Deliberately Unvalidatable Root Zone'' (DURZ) that uses dummy keys, with the final DNSKEY record not being distributed until July 1, 2010.&lt;ref name="last-puzzle-pieces"&gt;{{Cite journal | last= Hutchinson | first= James | title= ICANN, Verisign place last puzzle pieces in DNSSEC saga | publisher= NetworkWorld | url= http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/050610-icann-verisign-place-last-puzzle.html?hpg1=bn | date= 6 May 2010 | postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means the keys that were used to sign the zone use are deliberately unverifiable; the reason for this deployment was to monitor changes in traffic patterns caused by the larger responses to queries requesting DNSSEC resource records.

The [[.org]] top-level domain has been signed with DNSSEC in June 2010, followed by [[.com]], [[.net]], and [[.edu]] later in 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201010/5366/DNSSEC-to-become-standard-on-ORG-domains-by-end-of-June|title=DNSSEC to become standard on .ORG domains by end of June|accessdate=2010-03-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315143451/http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201010/5366/DNSSEC-to-become-standard-on-ORG-domains-by-end-of-June|archivedate=2010-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2039648/verisign-deploys-dnssec-com-tld The Inquirer: Verisign deploys DNSSEC on .com TLD]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Country code top-level domain]]s were able to deposit keys starting in May 2010.&lt;ref name="heise"&gt;[http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/More-security-for-root-DNS-servers-962569.html More security for root DNS servers] Heise Online, 24 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011|11}} more than 25% of top-level domains are signed with DNSSEC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circleid.com/posts/20111130_dnssec_update_from_icann_42_in_dakar/ CircleID: DNSSEC Update from ICANN 42 in Dakar]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Implementation====
On January 25, 2010, the L (ell) root server began serving a ''Deliberately Unvalidatable Root Zone'' (DURZ). The zone uses signatures of a [[SHA-2]] (SHA-256) hash created using the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm, as defined in RFC 5702.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= DNSSEC Root Zone High Level Technical Architecture | url= http://www.root-dnssec.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/draft-icann-dnssec-arch-v1dot4.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RFC 5702, §2.1. "RSA public keys for use with RSA/SHA-256 are stored in DNSKEY resource records (RRs) with the algorithm number 8."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RFC 5702, §3.1. "RSA/SHA-256 signatures are stored in the DNS using RRSIG resource records (RRs) with algorithm number 8."&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2010, all thirteen root servers have begun serving the DURZ.&lt;ref name="last-puzzle-pieces"/&gt;  On July 15, 2010, the first root full production DNSSEC root zone was signed, with the SOA serial 2010071501.   Root trust anchors are [https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/ available from IANA].&lt;ref name="dnssec-status-live"/&gt;

===Deployment at the TLD level===
Underneath the root there is a large set of top level domains that must be signed in order to achieve full DNSSEC deployment.  The [[List of Internet top-level domains]] provides details about which of the existing top level domains have been signed and linked to the root.

===DNSSEC Lookaside Validation===
In March 2006, the [[Internet Systems Consortium]] introduced the DNSSEC Lookaside Validation registry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.isc.org/news-article/isc-launches-dlv-registry-kick-worldwide-dnssec-deployment ISC Launches DLV registry to kick off worldwide DNSSEC deployment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614123636/https://www.isc.org/news-article/isc-launches-dlv-registry-kick-worldwide-dnssec-deployment |date=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DLV was intended to make DNSSEC easier to deploy in the absence of a root trust anchor. At the time it was imagined that a validator might have to maintain large numbers of trust anchors corresponding to signed subtrees of the DNS.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 5011, "Automated Updates of DNS Security (DNSSEC) Trust Anchors"&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of DLV was to allow validators to offload the effort of managing a trust anchor repository to a trusted third party. The DLV registry maintains a central list of trust anchors, instead of each validator repeating the work of maintaining its own list.

To use DLV, a validator that supports it is needed, such as [[BIND]] or [[Unbound (DNS Server)|Unbound]], configured with a trust anchor for a DLV zone. This zone contains DLV records;&lt;ref&gt;RFC 4431, "The DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) DNS Resource Record"&lt;/ref&gt; these have exactly the same format as DS records, but instead of referring to a delegated sub-zone, they refer to a zone elsewhere in the DNS tree. When the validator cannot find a chain of trust from the root to the RRset it is trying to check, it searches for a DLV record that can provide an alternative chain of trust.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 5074, "DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV)"&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaps in the chain of trust, such as unsigned top-level domains or registrars that do not support DNSSEC delegations, meant administrators of lower-level domains could use DLV to allow their DNS data to be validated by resolvers which had been configured to use DLV. This may have hindered DNSSEC deployment by taking pressure off registrars and TLD registries to properly support DNSSEC. DLV also adds complexity by adding more actors and code paths for DNSSEC validation. Further uncertainty arises because not all validating resolvers support or use DLV. Clients querying one resolver might get DLV-validated responses while clients using a different validating resolver would not.

DLV was not widely used. By May 2015, ISC's DLV registry contained under 5,000 domain names and fewer than 10% of these had an unsigned parent domain name. ISC has announced plans to decommission its DLV registry.&lt;ref&gt;https://ripe70.ripe.net/wp-content/uploads/presentations/81-RIPE-DLV-timeline-20150513.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear yet if or when DLV support will be removed from BIND and other implementations of validating resolvers.

===DNSSEC deployment initiative by the U.S. federal government===
The Science and Technology Directorate of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) sponsors the "DNSSEC Deployment Initiative".
This initiative encourages "all sectors to voluntarily adopt security measures that will improve security of the Internet's naming infrastructure, as part of a global, cooperative effort that involves many nations and organizations in the public and private sectors."
DHS also funds efforts to mature DNSSEC and get it deployed inside the U.S. federal government.

It was reported&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/87655 Department of Homeland and Security wants master key for DNS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406172122/http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/87655 |date=April 6, 2007 }}'' [[Heinz Heise|Heise]] News, 30 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; that on March 30, 2007, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] proposed "to have the key to sign the DNS root zone solidly in the hands of the US government."  However no U.S. Government officials were present in the meeting room and the comment that sparked the article was made by another party.  DHS later commented&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.upi.com/Security_Terrorism/Analysis/2007/04/12/analysis_owning_the_keys_to_the_internet/ Analysis: of Owning the keys to the Internet]'' [[United Press International|UPI]], April 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.mail-archive.com/osint@yahoogroups.com/msg39697.html UPI Analysis: Owning the keys to the Internet ]'' March 24, 2011 - First link is dead, this is believed to be the same content&lt;/ref&gt; on why they believe others jumped to the false conclusion that the U.S. Government had made such a proposal: "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is funding the development of a technical plan for implementing DNSSec, and last October distributed an initial draft of it to a long list of international experts for comments.  The draft lays out a series of options for who could be the holder, or "operator," of the Root Zone Key, essentially boiling down to a governmental agency or a contractor.  "Nowhere in the document do we make any proposal about the identity of the Root Key Operator," said Maughan, the cyber-security research and development manager for Homeland Security."

===DNSSEC deployment in the U.S. federal government===
{{outdated section|date=November 2015}}
The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) published NIST Special Publication 800-81 Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide on May 16, 2006, with guidance on how to deploy DNSSEC. NIST intended to release new DNSSEC Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements in NIST SP800-53-R1, referencing this deployment guide. U.S. agencies would then have had one year after final publication of NIST SP800-53-R1 to meet these new FISMA requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnssec-deployment.org/news/dnssecthismonth/200606-dnssecthismonth/ DNSSEC Deployment Initiative Newsletter - Volume 1, Number 2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122021856/http://www.dnssec-deployment.org/news/dnssecthismonth/200606-dnssecthismonth/ |date=November 22, 2007 }}, June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  However, at the time NSEC3 had not been completed.  NIST had suggested using split domains, a technique that is known to be possible but is difficult to deploy correctly, and has the security weaknesses noted above.

On 22 August 2008, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a memorandum requiring U.S. Federal Agencies to deploy DNSSEC across .gov sites; the .gov root must be signed by January 2009, and all subdomains under .gov must be signed by December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2008/m08-23.pdf Memorandum For Chief Information Officers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916034802/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2008/m08-23.pdf |date=2008-09-16 }} Executive Office Of The President&amp;nbsp;— Office Of Management And Budget, 22 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  While the memo focuses on .gov sites, the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency says it intends to meet OMB DNSSEC requirements in the .mil (U.S. military) domain as well.  NetworkWorld's Carolyn Duffy Marsan stated that DNSSEC "hasn't been widely deployed because it suffers from a classic chicken-and-egg dilemma... with the OMB mandate, it appears the egg is cracking."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/092208-government-web-security.html Feds tighten security on .gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925011755/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/092208-government-web-security.html |date=September 25, 2008 }} Network World, 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deployment in resolvers===
Several ISPs have started to deploy DNSSEC-validating DNS recursive resolvers. Comcast became the first major ISP to do so in the United States, announcing their intentions on October 18, 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.comcast.com/2010/10/dns-security-rollout-begins.html Comcast Blog - DNS Security Rollout Begins], October 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnssec.comcast.net/dnssec-video.htm Comcast DNSSEC Public Service Announcement Video] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021044129/http://www.dnssec.comcast.net/dnssec-video.htm |date=2010-10-21 }}, October 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and completing deployment on January 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.comcast.com/2012/01/comcast-completes-dnssec-deployment.html Comcast Completes DNSSEC Deployment], January 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study at [[APNIC]], the proportion of clients who exclusively use DNS resolvers that perform DNSSEC validation rose to 8.3% in May 2013.&lt;ref name="CircleID"&gt;[http://www.circleid.com/posts/20130717_dns_dnssec_and_googles_public_dns_service/ Geoff Huston: DNS, DNSSEC and Google's Public DNS Service (CircleID)]&lt;/ref&gt; About half of these clients were using [[Google Public DNS|Google's public DNS resolver]].

In September 2015, Verisign announced their free public DNS resolver service,&lt;ref name="Verisign"&gt;[http://www.circleid.com/posts/20150929_verisign_public_dns_free_dns_service_respects_privacy/ Introducing Verisign Public DNS]&lt;/ref&gt; and although unmentioned in their press releases, it also performs DNSSEC validation.

By the beginning of 2016, APNIC's monitoring showed the proportion of clients who exclusively use DNS resolvers that perform DNSSEC validation had increased to about 15%.&lt;ref name="XA"&gt;[http://stats.labs.apnic.net/dnssec/XA Use of DNSSEC Validation for World (XA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

====DNSSEC Support ====
[[Google Public DNS]] is a freely provided, public DNS service, fully supporting DNSSEC.

On May 6, 2013, Google Public DNS enabled the DNSSEC validation by default; meaning all queries will be validated unless clients explicitly opt out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2013/03/google-public-dns-now-supports-dnssec.html Google Public DNS Now Supports DNSSEC Validation] Google  Code Blog, 1 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BIND]], the most popular DNS management software, enables DNSSEC support by default since version 9.5.

[[Quad9]] enables DNSSEC by default on its main servers. However, they also provide servers that don't use DNSSEC on different IP addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quad9.net/faq/|title=Quad9 FAQ|last=|first=|date=|website=Quad9|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Issues====
It has been known to break proper MX record lookup on Microsoft Exchange 2013 and older causing #550 4.4.7 QUEUE.Expired errors.

{{Update|date=May 2008}}
The '''Ethiopian Heritage Museum''' is a museum highlighting the culture and heritage of the [[Ethiopian Jewish]] community to be built in [[Rehovot]], [[Israel]]. The museum, planned as a research, interpretive and spiritual center, is the brainchild of Tomer, an association whose members are veteran Ethiopian immigrants and former [[Mossad]] agents who took part in the first operations to bring Ethiopian Jews to Israel.

==Building==
Plans for the museum, expected to cost some $4.5 million, include a model Ethiopian village, an herb garden, an artificial stream, an amphitheater, classrooms and a memorial to Ethiopian Jews who died in Sudan on their way to Israel and Ethiopian Zionist activists. "We view the conservation of the past as very important and believe the museum will attract young people and adults alike," Rehovot Mayor Shuki Forer says.

==Location==
A large number of Ethiopian Jews make their home in Rehovot and surrounding towns, the reason for its selection as the site of the museum. The city has set aside six dunams, {{convert|1.5|acre|m2}}, of land for the museum complex.

==History==
:''"The Jews of Ethiopia have a rich cultural heritage, and are the only Jews who strictly kept their [[Judaism]] although they were entirely cut off from the Jewish people," said Tomer chairman Moshe Bar-Yuda. "The museum will present Ethiopian Jewish culture to Israelis who are not familiar enough with it, and also to young Ethiopians who fall between the cracks - on one hand they are not connected to their parents' culture, and on the other, they sometimes find it hard to become part of the dynamic of life in Israel. When they see the ancient culture of their forebears, they will be filled with pride, and it will be easier for them to become part of veteran Israeli society,"'' he says.
:''"All 21 members of the Rehovot City Council, both coalition and opposition, voted for the establishment of the center,"'' says Abai Zaudeh, a council member and a member of Tomer's board of directors. ''"It's the first time they all agree and leave politics behind to focus on the reality that the establishment of the museum will assist the absorption of the Ethiopian community a great deal,"'' he says.

One of the museum's founders was [[Baruch Tegegne]], who pioneered escape routes from Ethiopia via Sudan and fought for the right of Jews to emigrate to Israel. Other founders include veteran Ethiopian rights activist Babu Yaakov, a former member of the Ramle City Council, and Shetu Barehon, who worked in the transit camps in Sudan to bring Ethiopian Jews to Israel. A number of Ethiopian Jewish spiritual leaders and rabbis are also working to increase support for the project in the community and the Diaspora.

Bar-Yuda's long association with the Ethiopian Jewish community began in 1958, when the Jewish Agency asked him to go to Ethiopia to look for Jews, reaching remote villages. The report he prepared, along with a 16th-century ruling by Rabbi [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|David B. Zimra]], known as the Radbaz, was the basis for the 1973 ruling by then-chief Sephardic rabbi Ovadia Yosef that the Jews of Ethiopia were to be considered Jews according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]].&lt;ref&gt;''Museum on history of Ethiopian Jewry to be built in Rehovot'', by Ayanawu Farada Sanbetu, 19:26 18 July 2005, HAARETZ.com [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=599229]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13328">A '''Faceted classification''' is a [[classification scheme]] used in organizing knowledge into a systematic order. A faceted classification uses semantic categories, either general or subject-specific, that are combined to create the full classification entry. Many library classification systems use a combination of a fixed, enumerative taxonomy of concepts with subordinate facets that further refine the topic.

== Definition ==
There are two primary types of classification used for information organization: enumerative and faceted. An enumerative classification contains a full set of entries for all concepts.&lt;ref name=lcsh&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A faceted classification system uses a set of semantically cohesive categories that are combined as needed to create an expression of a concept. In this way, the faceted classification is not limited to already defined concepts. While this makes the classification quite flexible, it also makes the resulting expression of topics complex.&lt;ref name=sven&gt;{{Citation

        }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent possible, facets represent "clearly defined, mutually exclusive, and collectively exhaustive aspects of a subject. The premise is that any subject or class can be analyzed into its component parts (i.e., its aspects, properties, or characteristics)."&lt;ref name=joudrey&gt;Joudrey,Daniel N., Arlene G. Taylor, and David P. Miller (2015). ''Introduction to Cataloging and Classification''. 11th ed. Santa Barbara, CA: Libraries Unlimited.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commonly used general-purpose facets are time, place, and form.&lt;ref name=chan /&gt;

There are few purely faceted classifications; the best known of these is the [[Colon Classification]] of [[S. R. Ranganathan]], a general knowledge classification for libraries. Some other faceted classifications are specific to special topics, such as the Art and Architecture Thesaurus and the faceted classification of occupational safety and health topics created by D. J. Foskett for the International Labour Organization.&lt;ref name=coyle /&gt;

Many library classifications combine the enumerative and faceted classification techniques. The [[Dewey Decimal Classification]], the [[Library of Congress Classification]], and the [[Universal Decimal Classification]] all make use of facets at various points in their enumerated classification schedules. The allowed facets vary based on the subject area of the classification. These facets are recorded as tables that represent recurring types of subdivisions within subject areas. There are general facets that can be used wherever appropriate, such as geographic subdivisions of the topic. Other tables are applied only to specific areas of the schedules. Facets can be combined to create a complex subject statement.&lt;ref name=chan /&gt;

Daniel Joudrey and Arlene Taylor describe faceted classification using an analogy: “If one thinks of each of the faces of a cut and polished diamond as a facet of the whole, one can picture a classification notation that has small notations standing for subparts of the whole topic, which are pieced together to create a complete classification notation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joudrey|first1=Daniel N., and Arlene G. Taylor|year=2018|title=The Organization of Information|location=Santa Barbara, CA|publisher=Libraries Unlimited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faceted classifications exhibit many of the same problems as classifications based on a hierarchy. In particular, some concepts could belong in more than one facet, so their placement in the classification may appear to be arbitrary to the classifier. It also tends to result in a complex notation because each facet must be distinguishable as recorded.&lt;ref name=sven /&gt;

== Retrieval ==
Search in systems with faceted classification can enable a user to navigate information along multiple paths corresponding to different orderings of the facets. This contrasts with traditional taxonomies in which the hierarchy of categories is fixed and unchanging.&lt;ref name="Star, S.L. 1998"&gt;Star, S. L. (1998, Fall). "Grounded classification: grounded theory and faceted classification". [Electronic version]. ''Library Trends''. 47.2, 218.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible to use facets to filter search results to more quickly find desired results.

==Examples of faceted classifications==
=== Colon classification for library materials ===
The [[Colon Classification]] developed by [[S. R. Ranganathan]] is an example of general faceted classification designed to be applied to all library materials. In the Colon Classification system, a book is assigned a set of values from each independent facet.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, E. (1984, February). "A Tribute to S. R.  Ranganathan, the father of Indian library science". ''Essays of an Information Scientist'', 7, 37-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  This facet formula uses punctuation marks and symbols placed between the facets to connect them. Colon classification was named after its use of the colon as the primary symbol in its notation.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, L. M. (1994). Cataloging and classification.  New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essessreference.com/servlet/esGetBiblio?bno=000374 Colon Classification (6th Edition)] by Dr. S.R. Ranganathan, published by Ess Publications, Delhi, India.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranganathan stated that hierarchical classification schemes like the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) or the Library of Congress Subject Headings are too limiting and finite to use for modern classification and that many items can pertain information to more than one subject.  He organized his classification scheme into 42 classes.  Each class can be categorized according to particular characteristics, that he called facets.  Ranganathan said that there are five fundamental categories that can be used to demonstrate the facets of a subject: personality, material, energy, space and time.  He called this the PMEST formula:&lt;ref&gt;Ranganathan, S. R (1987). Colon classification, 7th ed. revised and edited by M.A. Gopinath. Bangalore: Sarada Ranganathan Endowment for Library Science, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Personality is the most specific or focal subject.
*Matter is the substance, properties or materials of the subject.
*Energy includes the processes, operations and activities.
*Space relates to the geographic location of the subject.
*Time refers to the dates or seasons of the subject.

=== Universal Decimal Classification ===
Another example of a faceted classification scheme is the [[Universal Decimal Classification]] (UDC), the UDC is considered to be a complex multilingual classification that can be used in all fields of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;About universal decimal classification and the udc consortium. (2006). Retrieved November 30, 2013, from http://www.udcc.org/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
The Universal Decimal Classification scheme was created at the end of the nineteenth century by Belgian bibliographers [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri la Fontaine]]. The goal of their system was to create an index that would be able to record knowledge even if it is stored in non-conventional ways including materials in notebooks and ephemera. They also wanted their index to organize material systematically instead of alphabetically.&lt;ref&gt;Batty, D. (2003). Universal decimal classification.  Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UDC has an overall taxonomy of knowledge that is extended with a number of facets, such as language, form, place and time. Each facet has its own symbol in the notation, such as: "=" for language; "-02" for materials, "[...]" for subordinate concepts.&lt;ref name=chan&gt;{{Cite book     |publisher = The Scarecrow Press, Inc.     |isbn = 978-0-8108-5944-9     |title = Cataloging and classification     |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL9558667M/Cataloging_and_Classification     |last = Chan|first=Lois Mai|edition = Third     |publication-date = 2007 |page=321|id = 0810859440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faceted Classification for Occupational Safety and Health===

[[Douglas John Foskett|D. J. Foskett]], a member of the [[Classification Research Group]] in London, developed classification of occupational safety and health materials for the library of the [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;ref name=coyle&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coyle|first1=Karen|title=A Faceted Classification for Occupational Safety and Health|journal=Special Libraries|date=1975|volume=66|issue=5-6|pages=256–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foskett&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foskett|first1=D. J.|title=Proceedings of the International Conference on Scientific Information|chapter=Construction of a Faceted Classification for a Special Subject|date=1959|publisher=National Science Foundation|isbn=0-309-57421-8|pages=867–888}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a study of the literature in the field, he created the classification with the following facets:

*Facet A: Occupational Safety and Health: General
*Facet B: Special Classes of Workers, Industries
*Facet C: Sources of Hazards: Fire, Machinery, etc.
*Facet D: Industrial Accidents and Diseases
*Facet E: Preventive Measures, Protection
*Facet F: Organisation, Administration

Notation was solely alphabetic, with the sub-facets organized hierarchically using extended codes, such as "g Industrial equipment and processes", "ge Machines".&lt;ref name=foskett /&gt;

===Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT)===

While not strictly a classification system, the [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus|AAT]] uses facets similar to those of Ranganathan's Colon Classification:

*Associated Concepts (e.g., philosophy)
*Physical Attributes
*Styles and Periods
*Agents (People/Organizations)
*Activities (similar to Ranganathan's Energy)
*Materials (similar to Ranganathan's Matter)
*Objects (similar to Ranganathan's Personality)&lt;ref name=denton&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.miskatonic.org/library/facet-web-howto.html|author=William Denton|title=How to Make a Faceted Classification and Put it on the Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison between faceted and single hierarchical classification==
Hierarchical classification refers to the classification of objects using one ''single'' hierarchical taxonomy. Faceted classification may actually employ hierarchy in one or more of its facets, but allows for the use of more than one taxonomy to classify objects.

*Faceted classification systems allow the assignment of multiple classifications to an object, and enable those classifications to be applied by searchers in multiple ways, rather than in a single, predetermined order. Multiple facets may be used as a first step in a search process.&lt;ref name="Categories, Facets—and Browsable Facets?"&gt;Sirovich, Jaimie (2011). Categories, Facets—and Browsable Facets?, from http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/08/categories-facetsand-browsable-facets.php&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one may ''start'' from language or subject.
*Hierarchical classification systems are developed classes that are subdivided from the most general subjects to the most specific.&lt;ref&gt;Reitz, Joan M. (2004). Dictionary for library and information science. Westport, CT: Libraries Unlimited&lt;/ref&gt;
*Faceted classification systems allow for the combination of facets to [[Filter (software)|filter]] the set of objects rapidly. In addition, the facets can be used to address multiple classification criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Godert, Winfried. F. (1991). Facet classification in online retrieval. International Classification, 18, 98-109&lt;/ref&gt;
*A faceted system focuses on the important, essential or persistent characteristics of content objects, helping it to be useful for categorization of fine-grained rapidly changing repositories.
*In faceted classification systems one does not have to know the name of the category into which an object is placed a priori. A controlled vocabulary is presented with the number of documents matching each vocabulary term.
*New facets may be created at any time without disruption of a single hierarchy or reorganizing other facets.
*Faceted classification systems make few assumptions about the scope and organization of the domain. It is difficult to ''break'' a faceted classification schema.&lt;ref&gt;Adkisson, Hiedi P. (2005).  Use of faceted classification.  Retrieved December 1, 2013, from http://www.webdesignpractices.com/navigation/facets.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Falconer Madan.jpg|thumb|Falconer Madan]]
[[File:Bodleian Library entrance, Oxford.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Entrance to the Bodleian Library]]
'''Falconer Madan''' (15 April 1851 — 22 May 1935) was [[Bodley's Librarian|Librarian]] of the [[Bodleian Library]] of [[Oxford University]].

==Early life and education==
Falconer Madan was born in [[Cam, Gloucestershire]], the fifth son of George and Harriet Madan.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb |first=R. Julian |last=Roberts |authorlink=Julian Roberts |title=Madan, Falconer (1851–1935), librarian and bibliographer |year=2004 |edition=online |id=41047 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Marlborough College]] and [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], where he took part in Oxford and Cambridge Chess matches in 1873 and 1874, and won the University Singles [[Fives]] prize in 1874.  

==Career==
Madan was a Fellow of Brasenose from 1875 until 1880, when he was appointed sub-librarian of the [[Bodleian Library]]. In 1890 he was given the task of the creating a summary catalogue of the manuscripts of the Bodleian beginning with those not included in the catalogue of 1697. The completion of the ''Summary Catalogue'' is the chief monument of his work. In 1889 Madan became a Fellow again and lecturer in [[palaeography]] until 1913. Another significant publication of this period is his ''The Early Oxford Press: a bibliography of printing and publishing at Oxford, 1468&amp;ndash;1640'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1895).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/earlyoxfordpress00madauoft A digitised copy of the work is available from The Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912 Madan became [[Bodley's Librarian|Librarian of the Bodleian]]. During this time, a new underground book-store under [[Radcliffe Square]] was opened, the Library records were put into systematic arrangement, and the Bodleian Quarterly Record, a periodical  of more than local interest, was started. He resigned the Librarianship in 1919.

He was president of the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals|Library Association]] in 1914 and 1915, President of the [[Bibliographical Society]] from 1919 to 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/presidents.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804010233/http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/presidents.htm |archivedate=2009-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and President of the Oxford Bibliographic Society in 1924 and 1925. He published many library related works. In 1932 received the Gold Medal of the [[Bibliographical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/goldmedl.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011232615/http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/goldmedl.htm |archivedate=2008-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madan helped Sidney Herbert Williams revise his ''A Bibliography of [[Lewis Carroll]]'' (London: The Bookman's Journal, 1924), the first such, into ''A Handbook of the Literature of the Rev. C. L. Dodgson ([[Lewis Carroll]])'' (London: Oxford University Press, 1931), receiving co-author credit, and published a supplement thereto in 1935. He also edited ''The [[Lewis Carroll]] Centenary in London'' (London: J. &amp; E. Bumpus, 1932), a catalogue of the exhibition.

==Personal life==
Falconer Madan married Frances Jane Hayter (1862–1938) second daughter of [[Harrison Hayter]] the engineer. His son, [[Geoffrey Madan|Geoffrey]], was a celebrated anthologist. His daughter Ethel married [[Charles Fox Burney]] and his granddaughter [[Venetia Phair|Venetia Burney]] is noteworthy for proposing the name [[Pluto]] for the newly discovered planet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4596246.stm The girl who named a planet], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ghost Festival''', also known as the '''Hungry Ghost Festival''', '''Zhongyuan Jie''' (中元节), '''Gui Jie''' (鬼节) or '''Yulan Festival''' ({{cjkv|t=盂蘭盆節|s=盂兰盆节|cj=jyu4 laan4 pun4 zit3|p=Yúlánpénjié}}) is a traditional Buddhist and Taoist festival held in certain Asian countries. According to the [[Chinese calendar]] (a [[lunisolar calendar]]), the Ghost Festival is on the 15th night of the seventh month (14th in southern China{{failed verification|date=November 2017}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zhongyuan festival|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/olympic/211929.htm|website=China.org.cn|publisher=China Internet Information Center|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese culture]], the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the lunar calendar is called '''Ghost Day''' and the seventh month in general is regarded as the '''Ghost Month''' ({{lang|zh|鬼月}}), in which ghosts and [[spiritual being|spirit]]s, including those of the deceased ancestors, come out from the [[Underworld|lower realm]]. Distinct from both the [[Qingming Festival]] (or Tomb Sweeping Day, in spring) and [[Double Ninth Festival]] (in autumn) in which living descendants pay homage to their deceased ancestors, during Ghost Festival, the deceased are believed to visit the living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Culture insider - China's ghost festival|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/culture/2014-08/08/content_18268375.htm|accessdate=1 November 2017|publisher=China Daily|date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the fifteenth day the realms of Heaven and Hell and the realm of the living are open and both [[Taoism|Taoists]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] would perform rituals to transmute and absolve the sufferings of the deceased. Intrinsic to the Ghost Month is [[veneration of the dead]], where traditionally the filial piety of descendants extends to their ancestors even after their deaths. Activities during the month would include preparing ritualistic food offerings, burning [[incense]], and burning [[joss paper]], a [[papier-mâché]] form of material items such as clothes, gold and other fine goods for the visiting spirits of the ancestors. Elaborate meals (often vegetarian meals) would be served with empty seats for each of the deceased in the family treating the deceased as if they are still living. Ancestor worship is what distinguishes Qingming Festival from Ghost Festival because the latter includes paying respects to all deceased, including the same and younger generations, while the former only includes older generations. Other festivities may include, [[Papier-mache offering shops in Hong Kong|buying]] and releasing miniature paper boats and [[lantern]]s on water, which signifies giving directions to the lost ghosts and spirits of the ancestors and other deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese Ghost Festival - "the Chinese Halloween"|url=http://en.people.cn/90002/98669/98755/6798883.html|accessdate=1 November 2017|publisher=Peoples Daily (English)|date=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{main|Petavatthu|Yulanpen Sutra|Mulian Rescues His Mother}}
Evidence of [[ancestral veneration]] in [[Chinese culture]] appears as early as [[oracle bones|its earliest records]], with the [[list of kings of the Shang dynasty|Shang kings]] offering [[sacrifice]]s to their forefathers. Many aspects of the present festival celebrated across [[Sinosphere|East Asia]] derive from [[Chinese folk religion|such native rituals]] in ancient China.{{sfnp|Teiser|1988}}

The timing and origin story of the modern Ghost Festival, however, ultimately derives from the [[Mahayana Buddhism|Mahayana]] [[Buddhist scripture|scripture]] known as the [[Yulanpen Sutra|Yulanpen or Ullambana Sutra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Karashima Seishi |title=The Meaning of Yulanpen 盂蘭盆 "Rice Bowl" On Pravāraṇā Day |journal=Annual Report of The International Research Institute for Advance Buddhology at Soka University for the Academic Year 2012 |volume=XVI |date=March 2013 |page=289,301,302|url=http://iriab.soka.ac.jp/content/pdf/aririab/Vol.%20XVI%20(2013).pdf|quote=p.302 -Although this sutra has often been regarded as apocryphal [Japanese version has in recent times], the contents and ideas in it are well rooted in India as we have seen above.  In addition to that, the vocabulary and usage of Chinese words are more archaic, compared with Kumārajīva's corpus (401-413 CE), while they resemble greatly the translations by Dharmarakṣa (fl. 265?-311 CE).  Moreover, the transliteration 鉢和羅 (EH pat γwa la &gt; MC pwât γwâ lâ} of Skt. pravāra(ṇā), which only occurs in this sutra and its adaptation, i.e. the ''Baoen Fengpen jing'' 報恩奉盆經 (T. 16, no. 686, 780a20), indicates clearly that this sutra is not apocryphal but a genuine translation, because only somebody who knew the original Indian form was able to transliterate it thus correctly into Chinese. In conclusion, I assume [&lt;-missing in Japanese version] that this sutra is not apocryphal, but a translation from an Indian text translated by Dharmarakṣa or somebody else in pre-Kumārajīva times [Japanese version has 3rd to 4th century CE].

Maudgalyayana discovers that his deceased mother was reborn into the [[preta]] or hungry ghost realm.  She was in a wasted condition and Maudgalyayana tried to help her by giving her a bowl of rice.  Unfortunately as a preta, she was unable to eat the rice as it was transformed into burning coal.  Maudgalyayana then asks the Buddha to help him; whereupon Buddha explains how one is able to assist one’s current parents and deceased parents in this life and in one’s past seven lives by willingly offering food, etc., to the [[sangha]]  or monastic community during [[Pravarana]] (the end of the monsoon season or [[vassa]]), which usually occurs on the 15th day of the seventh month whereby the monastic community transfers the merits to the deceased parents, etc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=辛嶋静志 Karashima Seishi |script-title=「盂蘭盆」の本当の意味 ―千四百間の誤解を解く |trans-title=The Real Meaning of Urabon [Yulanpen] –The Solution to a 1400 Year Misunderstanding |journal=大法輪 (The Great Wheel of the Dharma) |page=185 |quote=東南アジアの盂蘭盆と東アジアのワン・オ一クパンサーなどは、いずれも、釈尊の時代に規定された様に七月十五日の自恣の日を祝っているのだが（日本ではこのことはすでに意識されていない）、東南アジアでは古代インドの暦に基づいて行われるのに対し、東アジアでは、中国の太陰暦に従っているので、ニケ月の差があり、これらが同一の行事ということに気付く人は少ない。English Translation: Both the East Asian Urabon [Yulanpen] and Southeast Asian Wan Ok Phansa [Thai name for Pravāraṇā] are celebrated on the 15th day of the seventh month, the day of Pravāraṇā just as it was promulgated in Lord Buddha's time (in Japan, this matter is not known to people).

This custom was also transmitted to China which does not have a rainy season, the calendar and dates preserved unchanged from the original but instead of using the ancient Indian calendar, the lunar [[Chinese calendar]] is used. In China, Japan, the Korean peninsula and other East Asian regions, vassa starts on the fourth month of the lunar Chinese calendar (May (in the Gregorian calendar) and lasts 3 months. [n.b. Since the start of vassa is fixed in East Asia in the fourth month, Pravāraṇā is also fixed to the 15th day of the seventh month].|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Theravada]]n forms of the festival in [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] (including [[Cambodia]]'s [[Pchum Ben]]) are much older, deriving from the [[Petavatthu]], a [[Buddhist scripture|scripture]] in the [[Pali Canon]] that probably dates to the 3rd{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref name=lange&gt;{{harvp|Langer|2007|p=[https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=dXB9AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT276 276]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Petavatthu account is broadly similar to that later recorded in the [[Yulanpen Sutra]], although it concerns the disciple [[Sāriputta]] and his family rather than [[Moggallāna]].

==Observance==

[[Image:Chinese floating lotus lanterns.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Chinese lotus lanterns floating in a river.]]
The Ghost Festival is held during the seventh month of the [[Chinese calendar]]. It also falls at the same time as a full moon, the new season, the fall harvest, the peak of Buddhist monastic asceticism, the rebirth of ancestors, and the assembly of the local community.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;{{harvp|Teiser|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During this month, the gates of [[Diyu|hell]] are opened up and ghosts are free to roam the earth where they seek food and entertainment. These ghosts are believed to be ancestors of those who forgot to pay tribute to them after they died, or those who were never given a proper ritual send-off. They have long needle-thin necks because they have not been fed by their family, or as a punishment so that they are unable to swallow. Family members offer prayers to their deceased relatives, offer food and drink and burn [[hell bank note]]s and other forms of [[joss paper]]. Joss paper items are believed to have value in the afterlife, considered to be very similar in some aspects to the material world, People burn paper houses, cars, servants and televisions to please the ghosts.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;"Hungry Ghost Festival". Essortment, 2002. Retrieved 20 October 2008. [http://www.essortment.com/all/hungryghostfes_opi.htm Essortment Articles.]&lt;/ref&gt; Families also pay tribute to other unknown wandering ghosts so that these homeless souls do not intrude on their lives and bring misfortune. A large feast is held for the ghosts on the fourteenth day of the seventh month, when people bring samples of food and place them on an offering table to please the ghosts and ward off bad luck.  [[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus]]-shaped lanterns are lit and set afloat in [[river]]s and out onto [[sea]]s to [[symbol]]icly [[guide]] the lost [[soul]]s of forgotten [[ancestor]]s to the [[afterlife]].

In some East Asian countries today, live performances are held and everyone is invited to attend. The first row of seats are always empty as this is where the ghosts sit. The shows are always put on at night and at high volumes as the sound is believed to attract and please the ghosts. Some shows include [[Chinese opera]], dramas, and in some areas, even [[burlesque]] shows. Traditionally Chinese opera was the main source of entertainment but the newer shows, concerts, dramas, wars and so forth are referred to as [[Getai]].&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;"Chinese Culture: Hungry Ghost Festival" [http://www.chinese-culture.net/html/hungry_ghost_festival.html Modern China]&lt;/ref&gt;  These acts are better known as "Merry-making".&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;"Ghost Festival" ChinaVoc 2001–2007, [http://www.chinavoc.com/festivals/ghost.htm Online Store.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608143719/http://www.chinavoc.com/festivals/ghost.htm |date=8 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For rituals, [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Taoism|Taoists]] hold ceremonies to relieve ghosts from suffering, many of them holding ceremonies in the afternoon or at night (as it is believed that the ghosts are released from hell when the sun sets). Altars are built for the deceased and priests and monks alike perform rituals for the benefit of ghosts. Monks and priests often throw rice or other small foods into the air in all directions to distribute them to the ghosts.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

During the evening, [[incense]] is burnt in front of the doors households. Incense stands for prosperity in Chinese culture, so families believe that there is more prosperity in burning more incense.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;  During the festival, some shops are closed as they want to leave the streets open for the ghosts. In the middle of each street stands an altar of incense with fresh fruit and sacrifices displayed on it.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

Fourteen days after the festival, to make sure all the hungry ghosts find their way back to hell, people float water lanterns and set them outside their houses. These lanterns are made by setting a lotus flower-shaped lantern on a paper boat. The lanterns are used to direct the ghosts back to the underworld, and when they go out, it symbolizes that they have found their way back.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

==Celebrations in other countries/regions==
===Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia===
Concert-like performances are a prominent feature of the Ghost Festival in Singapore and Malaysia. Those live concerts are popularly known as [[Getai]] in Mandarin or ''Koh-tai'' in [[Min Nan|Hokkien]] Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitsingapore.com/festivals-events-singapore/cultural-festivals/hungry-ghost-festival/|title=Hungry Ghost Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are performed by groups of singers, dancers, entertainers and opera troops or puppet shows on a temporary stage that is set up within a residential district. The festival is funded by the residents of each individual district. During these ''Getai'' the front row is left empty for the special guests—the ghosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rove.me/to/singapore/hungry-ghost-festival|title=Hungry Ghost Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known to be bad luck to sit on the front row of red seats, if anyone were to sit on them, they would become sick or similarly ailed. 

In Singapore, people would pray to ghosts/Spirits or ancestors with offerings and fruits outside their homes for the start of the 7th month. Most patriotic events were held on 7th Month for Singapore, which includes general and presidential elections, the Olympics and the National Day Parade. This is where the number of outings were minimised.

In Indonesia, the festival popularly known as ''Cioko'',  or ''Sembahyang Rebutan'' in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], (Scrambling prayer). People gather around temples and bring an offering to a spirit who died in an unlucky way, and after that, they distribute it to the poor. The way people scramble the offerings is the origin of the festival name.

===Taiwan===
Traditionally, it is believed that ghosts haunt the island of [[Taiwan]] for the entire seventh lunar month, when the mid-summer ''Ghost Festival'' is held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinatownconnection.com/taiwan-ghost-festival.htm Mid-Summer Ghost Festival], [http://www.chinatownconnection.com/ Chine Town Connection].&lt;/ref&gt; The month is known as ''Ghost Month''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/festival_c/ghost_e/html/ghost2.htm Ghost Month] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203024217/http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/festival_c/ghost_e/html/ghost2.htm |date=3 December 2010 }}, [http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/festival_c/ghost_e/ghost.htm Ghost Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229022751/http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/festival_c/ghost_e/ghost.htm |date=29 December 2010 }}, [http://www.gio.gov.tw/ Government Information Office]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403211555/http://www.gio.gov.tw/ |date=3 April 2005 }}, [[Taiwan]].&lt;/ref&gt; The first day of the month is marked by opening the gate of a temple, symbolizing the gates of hell. On the twelfth day, lamps on the main altar are lit. On the thirteenth day, a procession of lanterns is held. On the fourteenth day, a parade is held for releasing water lanterns. Incense and food are offered to the spirits to deter them from visiting homes and [[Hell money|spirit paper money]] is also burnt as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.go2taiwan.net/monthly_selection.php?sqno=14 Taiwan's Ghost Festival and Other Religious Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029060207/http://go2taiwan.net/monthly_selection.php?sqno=14 |date=October 29, 2010 }}, [http://www.go2taiwan.net/ Go2Taiwan.net].&lt;/ref&gt; During the month, people avoid surgery, buying cars, swimming, moving house, marrying, whistling and going out or taking pictures after dark. It is also important that addresses are not revealed to the ghosts.

====''Chūgen''====
&lt;!-- This section is linked to from Chūgen --&gt;
{{nihongo|''Chūgen''|中元}}, also {{nihongo|''Ochūgen''|お中元}}, is an annual event in Japan on the 15th day of the 7th lunar month, when people give gifts to their superiors and acquaintances. Originally it was an annual event for giving gifts to the ancestral spirits.

One of the three days that form the {{nihongo|''sangen''|三元}} of [[Daoism]], it is sometimes considered a ''zassetsu'', a type of [[Japanese calendar#Seasonal days|seasonal day]] in the [[Japanese calendar]].

====''Bon''====

{{main|Bon Festival}}{{See also|Segaki}}
''Obon'' (sometimes transliterated ''O-bon''), or simply ''Bon'', is the Japanese version of the Ghost Festival. It has since been transformed over time into a family reunion holiday during which people from the big cities return to their home towns and visit and clean the resting places of their ancestors.

Traditionally including a dance festival called [[Bon Odori]], Obon has existed in Japan for more than 500 years. In modern Japan, it is held on July 15 in the eastern part ([[Kantō region|Kantō]]), on August 15 in the western part ([[Kansai]]), and in [[Okinawa]] and the [[Amami Islands]] it is celebrated as in China on the 15th day of the 7th lunar month.

===Vietnam===
[[File:Ghost Festival Roses.jpg|thumb|A white and red rose issued to guests at a Tết Trung Nguyên service]]
This festival is known as ''Tết Trung Nguyên'' and is viewed as a time for the pardoning of condemned souls who are released from hell. The "homeless" should be "fed" and appeased with offerings of food. Merits for the living are also earned by the release of birds and fish. The lunar month in which the festival takes place is colloquially known as ''Tháng Cô Hồn'' - the month of lonely spirits, and believed to be haunted and particularly unlucky.

Influenced by [[Buddhism]], this holiday coincides with ''Vu Lan''，the Vietnamese transliteration for Ullambana.

In modern times, Vu Lan is also seen as Mother's Day. People with living mothers would bear a red rose and would give thanks while those without can choose to bear a white rose; and attend services to pray for the deceased.

===Related traditions in other parts of Asia===
In Asian [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravadin Buddhist]] countries, related traditions, ceremonies and festivals also occur. Like its ''[[Ullambana Sutra]]''-origins in Mahayana Buddhist countries, the Theravada scripture, the ''[[Petavatthu]]'' gave rise to the idea of offering food to the hungry ghosts in the Theravada tradition as a form of merit-making. In stories published in the ''Petavatthu'' [[Maudgalyayana]], who also plays the central role in the rise of the concept in the Mahayana tradition, along with [[Sariputta]] also play a role in the rise of the concept in the Theravada tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13576275.2013.843512 | volume=18 | issue=4 | title=Buddhist funeral cultures of Southeast Asia and China | journal=Mortality | pages=388–389| year=2013 | last1=Pearce | first1=Callum }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=oeBL7ci3MKoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Sacred Biography in the Buddhist Traditions of South and Southeast Asia| isbn=9788120818125| last1=Schober| first1=Juliane| year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hecker|first=Hellmuth|title=Maha-Moggallana|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/hecker/wheel263.html|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to the rise of the concept in Mahayana Buddhism, a version of ''[[Mulian Rescues His Mother|Maudgalyayana Rescues His Mother]]'', where Maudgalyayana is replaced by Sariputta is recorded in the ''Petavatthu'' and is in part the basis behind the practice of the concept in Theravadin societies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacbc.org/docs/Thoughts%20on%20Obon.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of offering food to the hungry ghosts is also found in early Buddhist literature, in the ''Tirokudda Kanda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=7i8Jv5RuPs4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Tibetan Rituals of Death: Buddhist Funerary Practices| isbn=9781136959172| last1=Gouin| first1=Margaret| date=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Gibb Memorial Series''' (abbr. GMS ) is an orientalist book series with important works of [[Persian language|Persian]], Turkish and Arab history, literature, philosophy and religion, including many works in English translation. Some works were included in the [[UNESCO Collection of Representative Works]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gibb-memorial-series- |title=GIBB MEMORIAL SERIES – Encyclopaedia Iranica |last=electricpulp.com |website=www.iranicaonline.org |language=en |access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is dedicated to the memory of the Scottish orientalist [[Elias John Wilkinson Gibb]] (1857-1901). The series was published from 1905 to 1997, starting in London (Luzac), and later in other publishers. It appeared in an old series 1.1905-25.1927 and a new series (NS) 1.1921-33.1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9024">The '''Inventory of Jewels and Plate of Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1574''' was published from manuscripts by Arthur Jefferies Collins in 1955. The published inventory describes jewels and silver-plate belonging to [[Elizabeth I of England]] with detailed references to other source material.

==Introduction==
The sources used by Collins were [[British Library]] Harley MS. 1560 and Stowe MS.555. The manuscripts represent the "Quenis Majesties juelles plate and other stuff" in 1574 and additions by gift or purchase over the next 20 years which were kept in the [[Jewel House]] at the [[Tower of London]]. Collins also collated information from other books and manuscripts to cross-reference information about the objects listed. Gifts of plate to the queen passed from the [[Privy Chamber]] to the Jewel House. Some pieces were melted down and others were given as [[diplomatic gift]]s. When the queen travelled, the towns she visited often gave her gifts of [[silver-gilt]] cups.

In 1574 the office of the Jewel House was located in a two-storey building on the south side of the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]]. This contained the records of the jewels and packing materials for sending jewels to court.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, pp. 3, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] in 1660, the Jewel House contained the monarch's personal collection of jewellery as well as the royal plate and the [[Restraint on alienation|inalienable]] state regalia.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The coronation regalia were kept separately at [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;Keay, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Many items of personal jewellery from the Jewel House were pawned or sold by [[Charles I of the United Kingdom|Charles I]] during the early 17th century, and most of the plate and regalia were melted down and turned into coins by Parliament during the [[English Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Keay, pp. 37–40.&lt;/ref&gt; A surviving jewel is the [[Chequers Ring]].

A list of jewels in the possession of [[Anne of Denmark]] in 1606 was published by Diana Scarisbrick.&lt;ref&gt;D. Scarisbrick, 'Anne of Denmark's Jewellery Inventory', ''Archaeologia'', vol. CIX, 193–237. The manuscript is kept by the [[National Library of Scotland]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1574 inventory was made [[John Astley (courtier)|John Astley]], [[Master of the Jewel Office|Master and Treasurer of the Jewel House]]. The Master had an annual salary of £50 and was able to exact payments from goldsmiths appointed to work for the Jewel House, and those who transported plate from the House to diplomats. The post was lucrative, but some of the perquisites of the role were exaggerated or overstated by [[Gilbert Talbot (courtier)|Sir Gilbert Talbot]], who was made Master in 1660 and in 1680 wrote a treatise entitled ''Of the Jewel house''.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, pp. 223–5: ''Archaeologia'', XII, pp. 115–23: British Library Add. 34359: Several other copies of Talbot's treatise survive in manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the inventory the items were listed in categories; below the main categories are given with some examples of the 1,605 entries.

'''''Leitkultur''''' is a German concept, which can be translated as 'guiding culture' or 'leading culture', less literally as 'common culture', 'core culture' or 'basic culture'. The term was first introduced in 1998 by the German-Arab sociologist [[Bassam Tibi]]&lt;ref&gt;Bassam Tibi: ''Europa ohne Identität? Die Krise der multikulturellen Gesellschaft''. btb. 2000. S. 154&lt;/ref&gt; 
and from 2000 onward the term figured prominently in the national political debate in Germany about national identity and [[immigration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/german-issues-in-a-nutshell-leitkultur-acceptance-vs-assimilation/a-38850129 Deutsche Welle: "German issues in a nutshell: 'Leitkultur' - acceptance vs. assimilation"]&lt;/ref&gt; The term then became associated with a [[Monoculturalism|monocultural]] vision of German society, with ideas of European cultural superiority, and with policies of compulsory [[cultural assimilation]].{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Bassam Tibi's definition==
{{no references|section|date=February 2017}}
Bassam Tibi first suggested a 'Leitkultur' in his 1998 book ''Europa ohne Identität'' ('Europe without identity'). He defined it in terms of what are commonly called [[Western culture|western values]], and spoke of a ''European'' rather than a German 'Leitkultur'. "The values needed for a core culture are those of [[modernity]]: [[democracy]], [[secularism]], the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], [[human rights]] and [[civil society]]." (B. Tibi, Europa ohne Identität, p. 154). These core values are similar to those of the '[[Liberal democracy|liberal-democratic]] basic order' (''Freiheitlich-demokratische Grundordnung'') which is considered the foundational value of the [[post-war]] [[West Germany]], and the [[Germany|unified German state]] after the [[German reunification]] of 1990. Tibi advocated a cultural pluralism based on a value consensus, rather than [[monoculturalism]]. However, he also opposed a value-blind [[multiculturalism]], and the development of [[Parallel society|parallel societies]] where immigrant minorities live and work, isolated from the western society around them. Tibi advocated a structured immigration policy, and opposed illegal immigration into Germany.

== Nationwide debate in Germany ==
{{one source|section|date=February 2017}}
Theo Sommer, then publisher of [[Die Zeit]], was one of the first to use the term 'German core culture', as part of a debate about the assimilation of immigrants in Germany, and national core values: "Integration necessarily implies a far-reaching assimilation onto the German guiding culture and its core values" („Der Kopf zählt, nicht das Tuch“, Zeit 30/1998).

However, the term only became a national political issue in October 2000. [[Friedrich Merz]], then leader of the Christian-Democratic [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] in the [[Bundestag]] wrote an article for [[Die Welt]], rejecting [[multiculturalism]], and advocated controls on immigration and compulsory assimilation in a German core culture. Merz, after being reminded of the earlier article by Theo Sommer, referred to Sommer as the inspiration for this policy. Sommer, in turn, claimed he was only advocating integration of immigrants, and distanced himself from the call for restriction of immigration ("Einwanderung ja, Ghettos nein - Warum Friedrich Merz sich zu Unrecht auf mich beruft", Zeit 47/2000). Merz, supported by the [[Brandenburg]] interior minister [[Jörg Schönbohm]] (CDU), proposed an annual immigration limit of 200 000, about 0.25% of the German population. Anything more, according to Merz, would exceed the absorptive capacity of German society. Immigrants had a duty, according to Merz, to adopt the basic cultural values of Germany.

Bassam Tibi now protested, that politicians had appropriated his proposal for their own purposes, and pronounced the entire debate a 'failure'. Most of the reactions to Merz's proposals were negative, and the debate split along party lines, with the government coalition (social-democratic [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]]) rejecting a German Leitkultur. [[Cem Özdemir]] (then Bundestag member, Green Party) and others defended 'integration' as against 'assimilation' of immigrants. Forcing immigrants to assimilate at any price would in any case, according to Özdemir, deny the reality that Germany was a multicultural society. Some reactions in media outside Germany likened the Leitkultur proposals to the enforced [[Germanisation]] in territories occupied by [[Nazi Germany]], where the population was usually forbidden to speak local languages.

In 2005, the new presiding chairman of the [[Bundestag]], [[Norbert Lammert]] ([[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]), proposed a re-opening of the debate on a Leitkultur. The proposal, he said in an interview in Der Zeit, has been summarily dismissed without argument; "The noticeable thing about the very short national debate is that the Leitkultur concept was widely rejected, as a negative reflex, but that there was a wide recognition of the problems underlying the debate" ("Das Parlament hat kein Diskussionsmonopol", Zeit 43/2005). There was no noticeable reaction to his suggestion at first: Lammert then proposed to move the discussion to a European level, to establish a ''European'' core identity. In an article in Die Welt, he wrote: "If Europe wishes to preserve the multiplicity of nation identities, and yet establish a collective identity, it must develop a political core ideal, a set of foundational values and convictions. Such a European core ideal must necessarily be based on the common cultural roots of Europe, on its shared history, and on shared religious tradition," (Die Welt, 13 December 2005).

In early 2006, the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] led to violent protests in Islamic countries, against depictions of [[Muhammad]] in a Danish newspaper. Lammert now restated his demand for a re-opening of the Leitkultur debate. The cartoon protests, he said, show that German society must reach a consensus on its "foundational values and a minimal standard of value orientation." The 'constitutional patriotism' (proposed by the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]]) would not suffice, since all constitutions are based on non-random cultural assumptions. Fundamental rights, such as freedom of the press and freedom of expression must be fully supported by a social consensus. Given the background of a multicultural society in Germany, according to Lammert, rights must be linked to certain cultural values, and a nationwide debate on this issue was necessary, to re-establish such a link. The idea of multiculturalism, was "perhaps originally well-intentioned", but had reached the end of its useful life. Multiculturalism could not be allowed to create a society where all values were equal - and therefore in practice had no values. In conflicts of values, society had to decide which values were valid, and which were not. Lammert insisted that he had never spoken of a ''German'' Leitkultur. The essential elements of the German culture were not specifically German, he said, and it would be better to speak of a ''European'' Leitkultur. ([[Deutschlandfunk]] interview with Lammert, reported in the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] of 8 February 2006).

Jörg Schönbohm also remains a vigorous advocate of a German core culture: in 2006 he suggested changing the name of the Berlin radio station ''radiomultikulti'' into  'Radio Schwarz-Rot-Gold' (black-red-gold, the colours of the [[flag of Germany]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netzeitung.de/medien/426204.html|title=Schönbohm wants "Radio Schwarz-Rot-Gold"|last=Kästner|first=Sven|date=21 July 2006|language=German|publisher=NZ Netzeitung|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111456/http://www.netzeitung.de/medien/426204.html|archivedate=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigrant tests==
{{no references|section|date=February 2017}}
The concept of Leitkultur figured prominently in the national debate about a test for immigrants to Germany. These tests are known in English as 'citizenship tests', see [[Life in the United Kingdom test]], but they often apply to all immigrants, not just those seeking [[naturalisation]]. In Germany, the federal parliament ([[Bundestag]]) ultimately decided against a national immigrant test, but the 16 [[States of Germany|states]] can set their own tests, which can be based on an officially defined German culture and values.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5050">A '''lidérc''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈlideːrt͡s}}) is a unique supernatural being of Hungarian [[folklore]]. It has three known varieties, which often borrow traits from one another.

The first, more traditional form of the lidérc is as a miracle chicken, ''csodacsirke'' in Hungarian, which hatches from the first egg of a black hen kept warm under the arm of a human. Some versions of the legend say that an unusually tiny black hen's egg, or any egg at all, may become a lidérc, or that the egg must be hatched by placing it in a heap of manure.&lt;ref name="mekro"&gt;Encyclopedia of Hungarian Folklore. (in Hungarian) http://www.mek.ro/02100/02115/html/3-1332.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The lidérc attaches itself to people to become their lover. If the owner is a woman, the being shifts into a man, but instead of pleasuring the woman, it fondles her, sits on her body, and sometimes sucks her blood, making her weak and sick after a time. From this source comes a Hungarian word for [[nightmare]] -- ''lidércnyomás'', which literally means "lidérc pressure", from the pressure on the body while the being sits on it. Alternate names for the lidérc are ''iglic'', ''ihlic'' in [[Csallóköz]], ''lüdérc'', ''piritusz'' in the south, and ''mit-mitke'' in the east.&lt;ref name="mekro"/&gt;
The lidérc hoards gold and thus makes its owner rich. To dispose of this form of the lidérc, it must be persuaded to perform an impossible task, such as haul sand with rope, or water with a [[sieve]]. It can also be destroyed by locking it into a tree hollow.

The second variety of the lidérc is as a tiny being, a temporal devil, ''földi ördög'' in Hungarian. It has many overlapping qualities with the miracle chicken form, and it may also be obtained from a black hen's egg, but more often it is found accidentally in rags, boxes, glass bottles, or in the pockets of old clothes. A person owning this form of the lidérc suddenly becomes rich and is capable of extraordinary feats, because the person's soul has supposedly been given to the lidérc, or even to the [[Devil]].&lt;ref name="mekro"/&gt;

The third variety is as a Satanic lover, ''ördögszerető'' in Hungarian, quite similar to an [[incubus (demon)|incubus]] or [[succubus]]. This form of the lidérc flies at night, appearing as a fiery light, a [[will o' the wisp]], or even as a bird of fire. In the northern regions of [[Hungary]] and beyond, it is also known as ''ludvérc'', ''lucfir''. In [[Transylvania]] and [[Moldavia]] it goes by the names of ''lidérc'', ''lüdérc'', and sometimes ''ördög'', literally, the Devil. While in flight, the lidérc sprinkles flames. On earth, it can assume a human shape, usually the shape of a much lamented dead relative or lover. Its footprints are that of a horse. The lidérc enters houses through chimneys or keyholes, brings sickness and doom to its victims. It leaves the house with a splash of flames and dirties the walls. Burning incense and [[birch]] branches prevent the lidérc from entering one's dwelling. In the eastern regions of Hungary and beyond, it is said the lidérc is impossible to outrun, it haunts cemeteries, and it must disappear at the first crow of a rooster at dawn.&lt;ref name="mekro"/&gt;

== Appearances in modern literature ==

A lidérc is mentioned in the famous historical novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' by [[Umberto Eco]].
{{quotation|But he knew a prodigious spell that would make every woman succumb to love. You had to kill a black cat and dig out its eyes, then put them in two eggs of a black hen, one egg in one eye, one eye in the other (and he showed me two eggs that he swore he had taken from appropriate hens). Then you had to let the eggs rot in a pile of horse dung (and he had one ready in a corner of the vegetable garden where nobody ever went), and there a little devil would be born from each egg, and would then be at your service, procuring for you all the delights of this world.}}

* mentioned in [[Katie MacAlister]]'s novel ''Fire Me Up'' as a variety of vampire.
* mentioned in [[Carol Goodman]]'s novel ''The Incubus'' (re-released as ''The Demon Lover'' under the penname Juliet Dark).
* mentioned in [[B. Justin Shier]]'s novel ''Zero Sum'' as a six=armed rapist monster.
* mentioned in [[Steven Brust]]'s &amp; [[Megan Lindholm]]'s novel, ''[[The Gypsy (novel)|The Gypsy]]''.

== Appearances in media ==
A shape-shifting lidérc is revealed in ''[[Lost Girl]]'' episode "Caged Fae" (301).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="132939">This is a '''list of [[Hebrew abbreviations]]'''.

This list is far from complete; you can help by expanding it.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Using this list==

===Sorting order===

The entries are sorted according to the Hebrew alphabet. Prefixes indicating prepositions, conjunctions and articles (such as ב, ד, ה, ו, כ, ל, ש) have generally been removed, with the following exceptions:
*Where the acronym is incomprehensible or meaningless without the prefix.
*Where the prefix is so integral to the acronym that variants without it rarely, if ever, occur.

In addition, suffixes modifying abbreviations have been removed using the same guidelines. When searching for an abbreviation ending in a plural, adjectival, or possessive suffix like ית, ים, י, ה, ו, ות, the suffix should be removed if not an integral part of the abbreviation, as described in regard to prefixes above. Depending on the typography, note that the [[gershayim]] (״) may either:

*Move to the penultimate position, even if the mark falls in the modifying suffix and not the abbreviation proper; or
*Remain in its place within said proper and not shift with the added suffix. Sometimes, depending on style, the suffix is marked with a [[geresh]] (׳), so that for example the plural of ש״ץ would be ש״צי׳ם.

====Partially-abbreviated phrases====

Where only part of a term is abbreviated (for example, [[Tanna Devei Eliyahu|תנא דבי אליהו]] abbreviates as תנא דב״א), the entry is sorted on the abbreviated portion (דב״א), and the unabbreviated portion appears in square brackets ([תנא]) to produce תנא] דב״א].

====Abbreviations with numerical elements====

Some abbreviations included here are actually [[gematria]] ([[Hebrew]] [[numeronyms]]), but the number is so closely associated with some noun that it is grammatically used as a noun and is synonymous with it, for example ב״ן, Ban.

Other abbreviations contain a variable gematria component alongside other words, like the chapter references פי״א perek yud-alef (chapter 11) or פ״ט perek tet (chapter 9). Rather than list separate entries for every possible gematria, or use only one example number, the gematria component is replaced with [x] to produce (for example) [x]פ״.

===Abbreviations from other Hebraic languages===

Some [[Aramaic]] and [[Yiddish]] abbreviations may not be included here; more may be found in the [[List of Aramaic acronyms]] and the [[List of Yiddish acronyms]], respectively.

Many of the abbreviations here may be similar or identical to those in the other lists of acronyms. In fact, a work written in [[Hebrew]] may have Aramaic acronyms interspersed throughout (ex. [[Tanya]]), much as an Aramaic work may borrow from Hebrew (ex. [[Talmud]], [[Midrash]], [[Zohar]]). Although much less common than Aramaic abbreviations, some Hebrew material contains Yiddish abbreviations too (for example, Chassidic responsa, commentaries, and other material).

===Abbreviation-like non-abbreviations===

Not all [[lexeme]]s containing a [[geresh]] (׳) or [[gershayim]] (״) are abbreviations, and such non-abbreviations do not appear in this list. Therefore, if after much effort an abbreviation still cannot be deciphered, it is sometimes helpful to try an alternate mode of interpretation. For instance, aside from abbreviations, the geresh and gershayim marks may also be used:

* To indicate a [[Hebrew numerals|'''number''' using Hebrew letters]]. This is likely when the letters are in reverse alef-beit order, or when the abbreviation consists of a single letter followed by a geresh. For example, the year תשע״ד or [5]774 [[Anno Mundi|AM]], or the ד׳ רוּחוֹת four directions.
* To indicate that the '''[[gematria]] of the word or phrase''' should be taken, as a [[double-entendre]]. For example, to give ''chai'' חַ״י (“life”) dollars to [[tzedakah]] means to give eighteen dollars to tzedakah, thereby giving another person life, and drawing the blessings of life upon the donor.
* In [[Modern Hebrew]], to '''modify the sounds of certain letters''', as in the names George ג׳וֹרג׳ and Charlie צָ׳רלִי.
* When [[transliterating]] '''foreign words''' into Hebrew. For example, [[Rashi]] often uses Hebrew letters to write [[French language|French]] translations of Biblical Hebrew, marking it with a gershayim like an abbreviation (ex. אפייצימנ״טו ''appaisement'', cf. "And thou wast pleased with me," Gen. 33:10). He usually appends בְּלַעַ״ז ("in the local language") afterwards.
* In '''[[anagram]]s,''' i.e., rearranging letters in a word or phrase. This is especially common in [[Kabbalah]]. For example, the first [[sefira]], חָכמַה (inspiration), can be rearranged to read כֹּ״חַ מָ״ה ("the potential of the indefinite"). The resulting words of the rearrangement are marked with gershayim.
* When listing '''the letters themselves.''' For example, ְמְנַצְפַּ״ך ''menatzpach'' lists all the Hebrew letters having special final forms at the ends of words.
* When '''spelling out a letter.''' In this way, אַלֶ״ף spells out alef א, and יוּ״ד spells out yud י. When using this method, gematria may also be significant, as above.

==History==
The company was founded as Homebase in late 1995 in [[Melbourne]], Australia by husband and wife [[Evan Thornley]] and Tracy Ellery, executives of [[McKinsey &amp; Company]].&lt;ref name=enterprise&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OciNwH5k4O0C&amp;pg=PA430 | title=Enterprise and Venture Capital: A Business Builders' and Investors' Handbook | first=Christopher | last=Golis | publisher=ReadHowYouWant.com | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reader's Digest]] invested $5 million in the company for an 80% stake.&lt;ref name=enterprise/&gt;

In November 1996, the company launched its Looksmart service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54 | title=Newsline | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=November 9, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After leadership changes at Reader's Digest, the company was sold back to the founders as well as Martin Hosking, with Reader's Digest providing a $1.5 million loan and retaining a 10% equity stake.&lt;ref name=enterprise/&gt;  In May 1998, the company raised $2.3 million from Amwin and $6.0 million from [[Cox Media Group]] and [[Macquarie Group]] and was valued at $23.2 million.&lt;ref name=enterprise/&gt; The company also relocated to [[San Francisco]].  In 1998, the company reached an agreement to provide directory and listing services for [[Microsoft]]. The deal provided the company with $30 million upfront and guaranteed payments of $5 million per year for 5 years.&lt;ref name=enterprise/&gt;
By 1999, the company had 500 employees.&lt;ref name=enterprise/&gt;  In April 1999, the company raised $59.6 million based on a post-money valuation of $430 million.&lt;ref name=enterprise/&gt;  On August 20, 1999, during the [[dot-com bubble]], the company became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]], raising $92 million based on a $1 billion valuation for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/looksmart-ltd-9351-5507 | title=LOOKSMART LTD (LOOK) IPO | publisher=[[NASDAQ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By October 1999, the stock price would reach $30 per share, giving the company a [[market capitalization]] of $2.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/thom-calandras-stockwatch-looksmart-shares-poised-for-something-but-what | title=LookSmart shares poised for something, but what? | work=[[Marketwatch]] | date=October 14, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders' 15% stake was worth $375 million.&lt;ref name=smart&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/01/21/1074360833933.html | title=LookSmart not looking smart | first=James | last=Chessell | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=January 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2000, the stock price peaked at over $70 per share.&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2000/10/04/1004looksmart.html | title=LookSmart Gets Wise To Value Of Volunteers | work=[[Forbes]] | date=October 4, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2000, the company acquired [[Zeal (web)|Zeal]] for $20 million.&lt;ref name=wise/&gt;  The founders only sold around 5% of their stock before the dot-com bubble collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.crikey.com.au/2009/01/14/thornley-2-looksmart-share-sell-off-remains-unexplained/ | title=Thornley 2: LookSmart share sell-off remains unexplained | first=Adam | last=Schwab | work=[[Crikey]] | date=January 14, 2009}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the dot-com bubble bursting in late 2000, the company fired 172 employees or 31% of its staff in January 2001 to cut costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2001/01/08/daily59.html | title=Layoffs for Looksmart | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=January 12, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2002, the company acquired [[WiseNut]] for $9.25 million in stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2002/03/11/daily15.html | title=LookSmart acquires WiseNut | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=March 12, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2002, Thornley resigned as CEO but stayed on as chairman. Three of the seven members of the [[board of directors]] resigned. By then the stock was trading at 16 cents per share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/06/29/1023864671788.html | title=Thornley tips LookSmart profits after boardroom showdown | first1=Jenny | last1=Sinclair | first2=Kim | last2=Zetter | work=[[The Age]] | date=July 2, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company announced in August 2003 that Microsoft, which accounted for 70% of the company's revenues, was testing its own search tools and the stock dropped 20% in a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/looksmarts-microsoft-deal-looks-rocky/ | title=LookSmart's Microsoft deal looks rocky | first=Matt | last=Hines | work=[[ZDNet]] | date=August 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 7, 2003, Microsoft announced that it would not renew its agreement with Looksmart and the company's stock price plunged 52% in a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2005/1031/182.html | title=Your Big Best Friend--Or Not | first=Kurt | last=Badenhausen | work=[[Forbes]] | date=October 31, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2003/10/06/daily17.html | title=Deal with Microsoft dies and LookSmart's stock plummets | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=October 7, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2003, the company settled a lawsuit filed in 2002 by customers after the company converted thousands of websites that originally had paid a onetime submission fee into a cost-per-click payment model.&lt;ref name=enterprise/&gt;

In May 2004, Thornley resigned as chairman and was replaced by Teresa Dial.

In '''''Magajane v Chairperson, North West Gambling Board''''', an important case in South African criminal [[procedural law|procedure]], Magajane sought leave to appeal against the dismissal of his constitutional challenge to the provisions of section 65 of the North West Gambling Act. This challenge was on the ground that the provision violated his right to privacy by authorising inspectors to search his commercial premises and to seize items without a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]]. While the section authorised inspections of both [[Licensed Property|licensed]] and unlicensed premises, he confined his challenge to inspections of unlicensed premises.

The court held that it had been established in ''[[Mistry v Interim National Medical and Dental Council of South Africa]]'' that "the scope of a person's privacy extends only to those aspects to which a legitimate expectation of privacy can be harboured."

The court also made it clear that a regulated business's right to privacy was softened the more its business was public, closely regulated and potentially hazardous to the public.

The question to be answered was whether the statute authorising the regulatory inspection could achieve its ends through means less damaging to the right to privacy: for example, by requiring a warrant. In other words, the court had to consider the applicant's expectation of privacy and the breadth of the legislation.

The court held that section 65 served the worthy goal of ensuring enforcement of the statute's regulation of the gambling industry, and that, although the owner or occupier of a gambling business generally had a low reasonable expectation of privacy in the gambling premises, the provisions relating to unlicensed premises were aimed at collecting evidence for criminal prosecution, and thus constituted significant intrusions. Their breadth extended the scope of permissible searches beyond situations in which the expectation of privacy was low, thereby endangering the privacy of property owners and occupiers who were not adequately informed of the limits of the inspection.

Furthermore, it was held that section 65 could achieve its purpose of promoting enforcement of the Act while simultaneously protecting the right to privacy of persons who were subjected to searches. Section 65 was accordingly held to be an unreasonable limitation of section 14 of the Constitution, and therefore unconstitutional. The application for leave to appeal was thus upheld, as was the appeal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1705">In '''''Miller v Janks''''', an important case in [[South African insolvency law]], the court held that an insolvent possesses an estate capable of being sequestrated even though, at the time of sequestration, his estate consists only of liabilities.

== Facts ==
Miller had acquired an estate by means of his occupation as a professional gambler. His assets had subsequently disappeared under suspicious circumstances, leaving only liabilities. Miller’s wife possessed fixed property, which she had received while Miller was pursuing his occupation.

In an application by Janks to sequestrate Miller’s estate, Miller contended that sequestration was not competent because he had no assets and, therefore, no estate.

== Law ==
In ''Ex parte Collins'', the judge had held that an estate consists both of assets and of liabilities. If there were no assets but only liabilities, there could be no estate (and ''vice versa''). Were this proposition correct, no order of compulsory sequestration could be granted where the debtor, immediately prior to the application for sequestration, had got rid of all his assets by a series of depositions.

== Judgment ==
The court granted an order sequestrating Miller’s estate. It rejected Miller’s argument that, because he no longer had any assets, he had ceased to have an estate and that therefore sequestration was not possible.

'''Namecoin''' ([[currency symbol|Symbol]]: '''ℕ''' or '''NMC''') is a [[cryptocurrency]] that implements the [[top level domain]] &lt;code&gt;[[.bit]]&lt;/code&gt;, which is independent of [[ICANN]].

Namecoin was mentioned by [[ICANN]] in a public draft report as the most well-known example of distributing control and privacy in [[DNS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/report-21feb14-en.pdf|title=The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers Identifier Technology Innovation – Draft Report|date=2014-02-21|work=ICANN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other proposed use cases include [[notary]]/[[timestamp]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.techworld.com/security/3449015/could-the-bitcoin-network-be-used-as-an-ultrasecure-notary-service/ | title=Could the Bitcoin network be used as an ultrasecure notary service? | work=Techworld | first=Jeremy | last=Kirk | date=2013-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study found that of the 120,000 domain names registered on Namecoin, only 28 were in use.&lt;ref&gt;Kalodner, H. A., Carlsten, M., Ellenbogen, P., Bonneau, J., &amp; Narayanan, A. (2015, June). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.698.4605&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "An Empirical Study of Namecoin and Lessons for Decentralized Namespace Design"]. In ''WEIS''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Namecoin is created by "merged mining," a process which reuses partial solutions to [[Proof-of-work system|proof-of-work]] problems from a parent cryptocurrency as valid proofs-of-work for a child cryptocurrency.&lt;ref&gt;Alexei Zamyatin, 24 august 2017.

==Carlsberg display of restoration noses==
The [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]] museum in Copenhagen has a nasothek collection that displays restored noses that were removed from portrait busts and statues after changes in the museum's [[art restoration]] policies.&lt;ref name=Huizing&gt;{{cite book|title=Klinik der menschlichen Sinne|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-76632-3|pages=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XaOg_nkDQR0C|author=E.H.

[[File:Nasothek.JPG|thumb|left|Detail: A closer look at the Copenhagen Nasothek display shows wide variety in surface textures and style.]]The [[Marble#Sculpture|white marble]] favored by Classical sculptors is easily broken, and many antique statues have been damaged since their creation by accidents, [[iconoclasm]], or vandalism. During the 19th century, it was common practice for museums to exhibit such marble sculptures in a "restored" state, with damaged parts repaired or reconstructed to make the statue look as much as possible as it did when it was first created. The noses of antique statues are especially likely to be damaged or missing, so many Greek or Roman statues acquired new noses during this era. Modern exhibition practice may differ from museum to museum. The minimalist approach prescribes removing such 19th-century additions in the interest of authenticity, as has been done in Copenhagen.&lt;ref name=Getty&gt;{{cite web|title=Getty Exhibition Spotlights Practices In Antiquities Conservation|url=http://www.getty.edu/news/press/center/hope_hygieia_release_040208.html|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ny Carlsberg museum, which has an extensive collection of Greek and Roman marble statues,  participated both in 19th-century restoration and in 20th-century "de-restoration." As a result, many Roman portrait heads are now noseless again, with their restored noses removed to the museum's nasothek.&lt;ref name=restor/&gt;

The museum display explains its contents in both Danish and English. The English description says, "The word ''nasothek'' means a collection of noses, in analogy with ''{{linktext|discotheque}}'', a collection of records."&lt;ref name=restor/&gt; The Danish explanation compares "nasotek" (Danish equivalent of "nasothek") to "{{linktext|bibliotek}}", a collection of books.&lt;ref name=restor/&gt;

"Aim:  We aim to provide resources for the study and research of Australian children's authors and illustrators, including both the literature and the historical and cultural context in which it was created."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1974 [[Lu Rees]], then President of the ACT Branch of [[Children's Book Council of Australia|The Children's Book Council of Australia]], proposed to the other branches, that the ACT Branch would begin a collection of biographical files on Australian children's authors and illustrators and a collection of their works.  Lu Rees offered her personal collection of several hundred works "as a first step." &lt;ref&gt;Rees, Lu (1981). "In the beginning (Reprinted from issue 1, 1981)." Notes, Books and Authors, 27th issue, 2005, page 3. "As a first step in this I offered to hand over my personal collection of a few hundred books as soon as there was a place to put them – this would be something to build on."&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection was maintained in the home of a member of [[Children's Book Council of Australia|The Children's Book Council of Australia]], and developed with donations mainly from Children's Book Council of Australia members.  In 1979, in response to the [[International Year of the Child]], Lu Rees initiated a plan to collect overseas translated editions of Australian authors.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Lu (1981). "In the beginning (Reprinted from issue 1, 1981)." Notes, Books and Authors, 27th issue, 2005, page 5. "...one of the Librarians from the Canberra Public Library Service (CPLS) rang me and asked, ‘What are you doing about the International Year of the Child?’... if I could throw in a personal idea, it would be to emphasise the ‘International’ and try to get foreign editions of our own authors’ work in the children's field."&lt;/ref&gt;

The memo states that a&lt;!-- This was not the first FISA warrant for Page. He was subject to one in 2014. --&gt; FISA warrant on Carter Page was sought and obtained on October 21, 2016, and that there were three subsequent 90-day renewals. The memo notes that FISA submissions are classified information.

The memo “raise[s] concern as to the legitimacy and legality” of the FISA application process relating to Page, and that [[probable cause]] was not made in the warrant application. It makes five main points. First it alleges that the [[Trump–Russia dossier|Steele dossier]] "formed an essential part of the Carter Page FISA application." The memo asserted that [[Christopher Steele]] was paid $160,000 by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, and that this information was not disclosed in the initial October 2016 FISA application or subsequent renewals.&lt;ref name="6 takeaways"&gt;{{cite web |last=Morrow |first=Adrian |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/us-politics/trump-memo-explainer/article37833630/ |title=6 takeaways from the newly released Trump-Russia memo |date=February 2, 2018 |work=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the FBI's application for a FISA warrant did describe, in a footnote, the origins and political background of the dossier,&lt;ref name="WaPo political influence"&gt;{{cite web |last=Nakashima |first=Ellen |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-dept-told-court-of-sources-political-bias-in-request-to-wiretap-ex-trump-campaign-aide-officials-say/2018/02/02/caecfa86-0852-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html |title=Justice Dept. told court of source's political influence in request to wiretap ex-Trump campaign aide, officials say |date=February 2, 2018 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fact conceded by Nunes and other Republican leaders on February 5, after the memo's release.&lt;ref name="footnotePolitico"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cheney |first1=Kyle |title=Republicans concede key FBI 'footnote' in Carter Page warrant |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/05/fbi-footnote-carter-page-warrant-390795 |work=Politico |date=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the memo alleges that the FISA application relied "extensively" on a ''[[Yahoo! News]]'' report from September 2016 by [[Michael Isikoff]], which referenced  Page's July 2016 trip to Moscow and used information from Steele.&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-news-michael-isikoff-describes-crucial-meeting-cited-nunes-memo-231005733.html |title=Yahoo News' Michael Isikoff describes crucial meeting cited in Nunes memo |publisher= |accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It asserts that the article was "derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News." Isikoff has stated that the information he got from Steele was actually information that the FBI already had. He also described Steele as serious and credible.&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt;

Third, the memo accuses Steele of being biased against the candidacy of Donald Trump, stating he was "desperate" and "passionate" that Trump would lose. It goes on to say [[Bruce Ohr]] knew about this bias and that it was not reflected in the FISA applications.&lt;ref name="6 takeaways"/&gt;&lt;ref name="qz.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=de Haldevang |first=Max |url=https://qz.com/1196883/a-summary-of-the-gop-memos-claims-about-fbi-wrongdoing/ |title=Here's what the GOP memo claims about FBI wrongdoing |work=Quartz |date=February 2, 2018 |accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohr however did not work on counter intelligence matters and had no role in obtaining the FISA warrants on Page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/why-the-nunes-memo-takes-aim-at-a-justice-department-official-specializing-in-gangs-and-drugs/2018/02/02/82e836e8-0847-11e8-94e8-e8b8600ade23_story.html |title=Why the Nunes memo takes aim at a Justice Dept. official specializing in gangs and drugs |first1=Matt |last1=Zapotosky |first2=Beth |last2=Reinhard |date=February 2, 2018 |accessdate=February 6, 2018 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memo's fourth point quotes [[Bill Priestap]] saying that the corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its "infancy" in October 2016 during the FISA application. The memo further alleges that [[Andrew McCabe]] testified that "no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) without the Steele dossier information."&lt;ref name="Day AP"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Day |first1=Chad |title=What the GOP Memo Says (And Doesn't Say) |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2018-02-03/what-the-gop-memo-says-and-doesnt-say |accessdate=February 4, 2018 |work=U.S. News &amp; World Report |agency=Associated Press |date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members of the House Intelligence Committee and sources close to the matter have stated that the Nunes memo "misquoted" and "mischaracterized" McCabe's testimony, which was given in private and has not been made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/02/02/rep_swalwell_nunes_memo_misquotes_mccabes_statement_about_steele_dossierfisa_warrant.html |title=Rep.

The memo also confirms that the spark for the FBI investigation into potential collusion between Trump's campaign and the Russians was not the Steele dossier, but rather the comments made by Trump adviser [[George Papadopoulos]], who told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that the Russians possessed "dirt" on [[Hillary Clinton]] in the form of hacked emails.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-gop-memo-papadopoulos-20180202-story.html |title=Sentence on Papadopoulos in GOP memo may undercut efforts to discredit Russia probe |first1=Karen |last1=Tumulty |first2=Rosalind S. |last2=Helderman |website=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That confirmation contradicts earlier claims by some that the investigation had been triggered by the Steele dossier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cassidy |first1=John |title=The Nunes Memo Undermines the Right’s Trump-Russia Conspiracy Theory |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-nunes-memo-undermines-the-rights-trump-russia-conspiracy-theory |work=The New Yorker |date=February 2, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sheth |first1=Sonam |title=We now know the tipping point that prompted the FBI to launch its Trump-Russia investigation |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-opened-russia-probe-after-papadopoulos-told-australian-diplomat-of-clinton-dirt-2017-12 |accessdate=March 3, 2018 |work=Business Insider |date=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memo notes that Papadopoulos is mentioned in the Page FISA application, and says "there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page and Papadopoulos." It also says the FBI's Russian investigation was opened by [[Peter Strzok]], who is accused of having "a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton."&lt;ref name="6 takeaways"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Day AP"/&gt;

Finally, the memo asserts that former FBI Director James Comey testified to Congress that the Steele dossier was "salacious and unverified." However, Comey's prepared remarks show that he was referring specifically to "some personally sensitive aspects" of the dossier, not the entire dossier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=READ: James Comey's prepared testimony |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/07/politics/james-comey-memos-testimony/index.html |accessdate=February 28, 2018 |work=CNN |date=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The memo was produced by a small group of House Republicans and staff, led by Devin Nunes, as part of an investigation into how the FBI used the [[Trump–Russia dossier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/20/house-republicans-quietly-investigate-doj-fbi-310121 |title=House Republicans quietly investigate perceived corruption at DOJ, FBI |work=Politico |date=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Democratic committee members were not informed about the investigation into the FBI or the preparation of the memo,  a possible violation of committee rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Herb |first1=Jeremy |title=Schiff accuses Nunes of altering memo before sending to White House |url=http://www.fox10tv.com/story/37398915/nunes-clashes-with-democrats-over-fbi-memo-review-white-house-consultation |publisher=Fox 10 |date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adam Schiff, the [[ranking member]] of the House Intelligence Committee, said that Nunes had not read all of the relevant source material, although Nunes had argued for months that the FBI and DOJ had taken part in a conspiracy.&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Ryan Sit |url=http://www.newsweek.com/devin-nunes-adam-schiff-secret-memo-release-memo-794957 |title=Nunes "cherry-picked" details for the secret memo without even reading the source material: Top Democrat |date=January 30, 2018 |newspaper=Newsweek |accessdate=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nunes had previously recused himself from the committee's investigation into Russia's interference in U.S. elections&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"/&gt; due to a House ethics investigation into Nunes' coordination with the Trump administration. The House Ethics Committee stated that "Nunes may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information, in violation of House Rules, law, regulations, or other standards of conduct" (the ethics investigation ended when the committee was unable to obtain the relevant classified information).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-intelligence-chairman-devin-nunes-recuses-himself-from-russia-probe/2017/04/06/8122b5bc-1ad2-11e7-855e-4824bbb5d748_story.html |title=House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes recuses himself from Russia probe |first=Karoun |last=Demirjian |date=April 6, 2017 |newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theweek.com/speedreads/751784/report-ethics-investigation-into-nunes-ended-because-panel-couldnt-gain-access-classified-info |title=Report: Ethics investigation into Nunes ended because panel couldn't gain access to classified info |date=January 29, 2018 |work=The Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after offering to step aside from the investigation into Russian interference, Nunes began his own "parallel" investigation, whose purpose appeared to be to undermine the original ongoing investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Natasha Bertrand |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/nunes-russia-investigation-subpoenas-fusion-gps-trump-2017-10 |title=Devin Nunes appears to be running a 'parallel' Russia probe without Democrats' consent |work=Business Insider |date=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 18 a growing number of Republicans began calling for the release of the memo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schwartz |first1=Sam |title=What Is the Nunes Memo?

Adam Schiff released a statement and a letter to Nunes on January 31, 2018, stating that Nunes had "made material changes to the memo he sent to White House – changes not approved by the Committee" and that the White House was "reviewing a document the Committee has not approved for release."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/schiff-accuses-nunes-of-altering-memo-before-sharing-it-with-trump-for-release/2018/01/31/251423c8-06fe-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html |title=Schiff accuses Nunes of altering memo before sharing it with Trump for release |last=Demirjian |first=Karoun |date=January 31, 2018 |work=Washington Post|access-date=February 1, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response [[Peter T. King|Peter King]], who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, stated, "My understanding is this was agreed on beforehand among Republicans.

A social media campaign under the [[hashtag]] "#ReleaseTheMemo" emerged on January 19, 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=February 2, 2018 |title=Trending Topics del viernes 19 de enero en Worldwide |url=http://www.trendinalia.com/twitter-trending-topics/globales/globales-180119.html |website=www.trendinalia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to publicly release the memo despite some of its classified contents.

According to the ''Hamilton 68'' project run by the bipartisan [[Alliance for Securing Democracy]] (ASD) which tracks Russian propaganda efforts on Twitter, the hashtag was promoted by Russian twitter bot accounts, with a 230,000 percent spike in the promotion of the hashtag by these accounts.&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;&lt;ref name=businessinsider/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dilanian/&gt; [[Clint Watts]], one of the founding researchers of ASD, said the social media campaign started trending after [[Julian Assange]] advocated for the memo's release, which was then repeated by Russian influence networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Elder |first1=Miriam |last2=Warzel |first2=Charlie |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/miriamelder/stop-blaming-russian-bots-for-everything |title=Stop Blaming Russian Bots For Everything |work=BuzzFeed News |accessdate=April 24, 2018 |date=February 28, 2018 |quote='When Julian Assange says something, Russian influence networks always repeat it,' Watts said.

[[Carter Page]] originally came to the attention of the FBI counterintelligence unit in 2013, prior to his becoming a Trump campaign adviser, when the unit learned that [[Evgeny Buryakov|Russian spies]] were trying to use Page as a source of information and to recruit him as an agent; this resulted in Page being interviewed by the FBI in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/us/politics/carter-page-trump-russia.html |title=Russian Spies Tried to Recruit Carter Page Before He Advised Trump |first=Adam |last=Goldman |date=April 4, 2017 |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nakashima&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-obtained-fisa-warrant-to-monitor-former-trump-adviser-carter-page/2017/04/11/620192ea-1e0e-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html |title=FBI obtained FISA warrant to monitor Trump adviser Carter Page |first1=Ellen |last1=Nakashima |first2=Devlin |last2=Barrett |first3=Adam |last3=Entous |date=April 11, 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McCarthy |first1=Tom |title=Who is Carter Page, the Trump ex-adviser at the center of the memo furore? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/02/who-is-carter-page-trump-ex-adviser-memo-furore-russia-fbi |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was under secret intelligence surveillance beginning in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/03/politics/mueller-investigation-russia-trump-one-year-financial-ties/index.html|title=One year into the FBI's Russia investigation, Mueller is on the Trump money trail|first=Evan Perez, Pamela Brown and Shimon Prokupecz,|last=CNN|publisher=|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page claimed that the information he provided to the Russians was innocuous.&lt;ref name=Nakashima /&gt; Page was the subject of at least one FISA warrant, going back to 2014, when he was alleged to have been colluding with the Russian government or knowingly working as an agent on its behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=Ariella |date=August 3, 2017 |title=Former Trump adviser Carter Page under FISA warrant since 2014: Report |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/former-trump-adviser-carter-page-under-fisa-warrant-since-2014-report/article/2630576 |work=Washington Examiner |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harding&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/03/carter-page-nunes-memo-216934 |title=Why Carter Page Was Worth Watching |publisher=[[Politico]] |date=February 3, 2018 |accessdate=February 6, 2018 |last=Harding |first=Luke}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump listed the little-known Page as one of his foreign policy advisers.

In a May 2016 meeting in London, Trump foreign policy adviser [[George Papadopoulos]] told the [[Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom]], [[Alexander Downer]], that the Russians possessed "dirt" on [[Hillary Clinton]] in the form of hacked emails.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Two months later, Australian officials passed this information to American officials.

The [[Trump–Russia dossier]] alleges that in July, Carter Page secretly met [[Rosneft]] chairman [[Igor Sechin]] in Moscow, together with a "senior Kremlin Internal Affairs official, DIVYEKIN"; that Sechin offered Trump a 19% stake in Rosneft (worth about $11&amp;nbsp;billion) in exchange for lifting the [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions against Russia]] after his election,&lt;ref name="Bertrand_11/6/2017"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bertrand |first=Natasha |title=Carter Page's testimony is filled with bombshells - and supports key portions of the Steele dossier |website=[[Business Insider]] |date=November 6, 2017 |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/carter-page-congressional-testimony-transcript-steele-dossier-2017-11 | access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weindling_1/11/2017"&gt;{{cite web |last=Weindling |first=Jacob |title=The 31 Most Explosive Allegations against Trump from the Leaked Intelligence Document |website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=January 11, 2017 |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/01/the-31-most-explosive-allegations-against-trump-fr.html |access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Page confirmed, on Trump's "full authority", that he intended to lift the sanctions.&lt;ref name="Withnall_Sengupta_1/12/2017"&gt;{{cite web |last=Withnall |first=Adam |last2=Sengupta |first2=Kim |title=The 10 key Donald Trump allegations from the classified Russia memos |website=[[The Independent]] |date=January 12, 2017 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-russia-10-allegations-dossier-kremlin-michael-cohen-sex-claims-intelligence-reports-a7522056.html | access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bertrand_1/27/2017"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bertrand |first=Natasha |title=Memos: CEO of Russia's state oil company offered Trump adviser, allies a cut of huge deal if sanctions were lifted |website=[[Business Insider]] |date=January 27, 2017 |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/carter-page-trump-russia-igor-sechin-dossier-2017-1 | access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tracy_11/7/2017"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tracy |first=Abigail |date=November 7, 2017 |title=Is Carter Page Digging the Trump Administration's Grave?

In September, after reports surfaced about Page's July trip to Russia, the Trump campaign said Page was not part of the campaign and never had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/297599-trump-campaign-backs-away-from-adviser-suspected-of-ties-to-kremlin |title=Trump camp backs away from adviser suspected of Kremlin ties |first=Harper |last=Neidig |date=September 24, 2016 |publisher= |accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page then said he was taking a leave of absence.

A month later, in October 2016, and after Page left the campaign, the FBI sought a FISA warrant to investigate his connections to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Prokop |first1=Andrew |title=Carter Page, the star of the Nunes memo, explained |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/2/16956014/nunes-memo-carter-page |publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warrant was granted by a FISA court judge and has since been renewed thrice, with each 90-day extension requiring new evidence "pertinent to intelligence-related collection" in order to back up the original application and to show that the warrant continues to be productive.&lt;ref name=LaFraniere&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/29/us/politics/release-the-memo-vote-house-intelligence-republicans.html |title=House Republicans Vote to Release Secret Memo on Russia Inquiry |first=Nicholas |last=Fandos |date=February 1, 2018 |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lucas /&gt;&lt;ref name=EmmonsAaronson&gt;{{cite web |last1=Emmons |first1=Alex |last2=Aaronson |first2=Trevor |title=Nunes memo accidentally confirms the legitimacy of the FBI's investigation |url=https://theintercept.com/2018/02/02/nunes-memo-fisa-trump-russia/ |publisher=[[The Intercept]] |accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the release of the memo, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported that in 2013, Carter Page bragged about being an "informal adviser to the Kremlin" in a letter to the editor. Page was asked about this admission on February 6, 2017, on ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]'' program, and had trouble explaining how he reconciled his dual roles as Trump adviser and Kremlin adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/06/politics/carter-page-trump-good-morning-america/index.html |title=Page struggles to explain how he could advise both Kremlin and Trump team |first=Maegan |last=Vazquez |publisher=CNN |accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page also claimed that he, despite being named foreign policy adviser, had never actually met Trump, contradicting his earlier statements in which he said he had been in a "number of meetings" with Trump and had "learned a tremendous amount from him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nelson |first1=Louis |last2=Griffiths |first2=Brent D. |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/05/carter-page-nunes-memo-393054 |title=Carter Page: I've never communicated with Trump |work=Politico |accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose===

Republicans posited that politically-motivated FBI employees attempted to undermine the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump presidency]], citing the [[Trump–Russia dossier]], which they say was an essential part of the evidence used for obtaining a FISA warrant to wiretap Page.&lt;ref name="Kiely_2/27/2018"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kiely |first=Eugene |title=Trump's Spin on Democratic Memo |website=FactCheck.org |date=February 27, 2018 |url=https://www.factcheck.org/2018/02/trumps-spin-democratic-memo/ | access-date=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=realaim /&gt; According to this argument, the FBI did not disclose to the FISA court that their request for a warrant depended on evidence in the [[Trump–Russia dossier]], a document funded by the [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Hillary Clinton presidential campaign]] and the [[Democratic National Committee]]; according to this line of argument, [[Rod Rosenstein]], Trump's Deputy Attorney General, knew of the funding from Democrats, and his approval of an application that failed to disclose that fact potentially implies that Rosenstein harbors some form of anti-Trump bias.&lt;ref name=EmmonsAaronson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2018/2/1/16955472/nunes-memo-release-diagram |title=The Nunes memo, explained with diagrams |publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |date=February 1, 2018 |accessdate=February 1, 2018 |last=Chang |first=Alvin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Republicans did eventually concede that the FBI disclosed this information in a footnote.&lt;ref name="footnotePolitico" /&gt;

[[Fusion GPS]], the firm behind the document, started its research into Trump with funding from the conservative news outlet ''[[The Washington Free Beacon]]''. However, the news outlet stopped funding this research when Donald Trump received the Republican nomination. Attorney [[Marc Elias]] then hired Fusion GPS on behalf of his clients, the [[Democratic National Committee]] and the [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign]], to continue this research and compile what would become the [[Donald Trump–Russia dossier]].&lt;ref name=WashPo25oct17&gt;{{cite news |last1=Entous |first1=Adam |last2=Barrett |first2=Devlin |last3=Helderman |first3=Rosalind S. |title=Clinton campaign, DNC paid for research that led to Russia dossier |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/clinton-campaign-dnc-paid-for-research-that-led-to-russia-dossier/2017/10/24/226fabf0-b8e4-11e7-a908-a3470754bbb9_story.html |accessdate=October 25, 2017 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 25, 2017 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fusion GPS paid [[Christopher Steele]] to write the dossier, and the FBI also paid Steele for the expenses&lt;ref name=EmmonsAaronson/&gt; he incurred on "a trip to Rome to meet with FBI officials".&lt;ref name="Robertson_2/7/2018"&gt;{{cite web |last=Robertson |first=Lori |title=Q&amp;A on the Nunes Memo |website=FactCheck.org |date=February 7, 2018 |url=https://www.factcheck.org/2018/02/qa-nunes-memo/ | access-date=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allies of Trump tried to move focus away from the Trump presidential campaign's alleged role in the Russian election interference by attempting to use the Nunes memo to portray the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|Special Counsel investigation]] as the real scandal.&lt;ref name=realaim&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/us/politics/secret-memo-mueller-russia-investigation.html |title=The Real Aim of the Nunes Memo Is the Mueller Investigation |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 30, 2018 |first=Charlie |last=Savage}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the hours before the expected release of the memo, sources reported that Trump told his associates that release of the memo would discredit the investigation and give him reason to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the supervisor of the Special Counsel investigation.&lt;ref name=Liptak&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kitv.com/story/37403522/trump-sees-nunes-memo-as-a-way-to-discredit-the-russia-investigation |title=Trump sees Nunes memo as a way to discredit the Russia investigation |publisher=KITV |date=February 1, 2018 |accessdate=February 1, 2018 |last=Liptak |first=Kevin |last2=Collins |first2=Kaitlan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rucker |first1=Philip |last2=Parker |first2=Ashley |last3=Dawsey |first3=Josh |title=‘Never any hesitation’: Trump was quickly persuaded to support memo’s release |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/never-any-hesitation-trump-was-quickly-convinced-to-support-memos-release/2018/02/01/b67a0246-076d-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3, 2018, Trump praised the Nunes memo and tweeted: "This memo totally vindicates 'Trump' in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their [sic] was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction." Rep. [[Trey Gowdy]] (R-S.C.) disagreed, stating on February 4 on CBS’ ''[[Face the Nation]]'': "I actually don't think it has any impact on the Russia probe." He went on to say:
{{quote|
"There is a Russia investigation without a dossier," Gowdy said. "So to the extent the memo deals with the dossier and the FISA process, the dossier has nothing to do with the meeting at Trump Tower. The dossier has nothing to do with an email sent by Cambridge Analytica. The dossier really has nothing to do with George Papadopoulos' meeting in Great Britain. It also doesn't have anything to do with obstruction of justice.

Republicans sought a committee vote that would request the release through the President, which would keep the memo confined to committee members until the President responded.&lt;ref name="cnn1" /&gt; The memo could be made public by a vote in the House of Representatives if the President did not act or denied the request, but no vote was scheduled for the full House.&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite web |last=Liautaud |first=Alexa |url=https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/paq5wm/these-two-deep-state-conspiracy-theories-are-driving-republicans-nuts-today |title=These two deep-state conspiracy theories are driving Republicans nuts today |publisher=Vice News |date=January 25, 2018 |accessdate=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2018, the Justice Department released a heavily redacted version of the October 2016 [[FISA]] warrant application for Carter Page, which stated in part "The FBI believes that Page has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government" and "the FBI believes that the Russian government's efforts are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with Candidate #1's campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/us/politics/carter-page-fisa.html |title=Justice Dept.

===Trump administration===
On January 24, 2018, Trump expressed support for releasing the Nunes memo. He reportedly told close advisers that he believed the memo would reveal the FBI's bias against him, and provide grounds for him to fire [[Rod Rosenstein]].&lt;ref name="Trump sought release" /&gt; [[White House Counsel]] [[Don McGahn]] wrote that "the memorandum reflects the judgments of its congressional authors" and that the reason for its release was "significant public interest in the memorandum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Aaron |title=Analysis: The full Nunes memo, annotated |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/02/02/the-full-nunes-memo-annotated/ |work=Washington Post |date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its release, Trump claimed in a tweet that the memo "totally vindicates" him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cochrane |first1=Emily |title=Trump Says Republican Memo ‘Totally Vindicates' Him |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/us/politics/trump-memo-vindicates.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republicans===
Before the memo was released, House Speaker [[Paul Ryan]] warned his fellow Republicans against overplaying the contents of the memo and tying it to the Mueller investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Williams |first1=Katie Bo |last2=Wong |first2=Scott |url=http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/371397-ryan-urges-lawmakers-dont-overplay-memo |title=Ryan urges lawmakers: Don't overplay memo |date=January 30, 2018 |work=The Hill |accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the memo was released, Ryan said, "The matter of concern outlined in this memo is a specific, legitimate one. Our FISA system is critical to keeping America safe from real and evolving threats. It is a unique system with broad discretion and a real impact on Americans' civil liberties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Weaver |first=Al |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/paul-ryan-nunes-memo-lays-out-a-specific-legitimate-worry-about-surveillance/article/2647957 |title=Paul Ryan: Nunes memo lays out a 'specific, legitimate' worry about surveillance |work=Washington Examiner |date=February 2, 2018 |accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan also supported the release of the Democrats' counter-memo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Manchester |first=Julia |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/371974-paul-ryan-supports-release-of-democrats-memo-spox |title=Ryan supports release of Democrats' countermemo |date=February 2, 2018 |work=The Hill |accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative [[Trey Gowdy]], the only Republican on the House Intelligence Committee who actually read the underlying classified material, said the FISA application cited other material besides the dossier, but in his opinion the warrant would not have been authorized without the dossier. He added that the dossier does not invalidate the Russia investigation, which would have been launched with or without it. He said he has confidence in Rosenstein, Wray, and Mueller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Watson |first1=Kathryn |title=Gowdy says surveillance warrant would not have been authorized without dossier |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trey-gowdy-face-the-nation-fisa-surveillance-warrant-would-not-have-been-authorized-without-dossier/ |agency=CBS News |date=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On February 2, [[John McCain]] rebuked his fellow Republicans with the statement, "The latest attacks against the FBI and Department of Justice serve no American interests―no party's, no president's, only [[Vladimir Putin|Putin's]]. ... If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin's job for him."&lt;ref name="Murdock_2/2/2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Murdock |first1=Sebastian |title=Sen.

===Democrats===
[[File:Correcting the Record - The Russia Investigations.pdf|thumb|Democrats' rebuttal memo]]
Democratic leaders in Congress&amp;mdash;[[House Minority Leader]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] and [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Chuck Schumer]]&amp;mdash;called upon House Speaker [[Paul Ryan]] to remove Nunes from the House Intelligence Committee, accusing him of abusing his

Schumer said that the memo aimed to spread "conspiracy theories" and attacked federal law enforcement in order to protect Trump from investigation.&lt;ref name="NBC 02012018" /&gt; Democratic House Whip [[Steny Hoyer]] also called for Nunes to be removed, saying Nunes' behavior had undermined the American people's trust in his chairmanship of the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Manchester |first1=Julia |title=Hoyer calls on Ryan to remove Nunes after release of memo |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/372052-hoyer-calls-on-ryan-to-remove-nunes-after-release-of-memo |accessdate=February 4, 2018 |work=The Hill |date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerry Nadler]] of New York, the [[ranking member]] of the [[House Judiciary Committee]], issued a six-page analysis rebutting the memo's legal basis and accusing Republican House members of being part of "an organized effort to obstruct" Mueller's investigation. Nadler, who reviewed the classified material used to obtain the FISA warrant, called the memo "deliberately misleading and deeply wrong on the law." He argued the FISA Court had probable cause to believe Page was acting as "an [[Foreign agent|agent of a foreign power]]."&lt;ref name="Memoli"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/democratic-rebuttal-calls-nunes-memo-deliberately-misleading-n844426 |title=Democratic rebuttal calls Nunes memo 'deliberately misleading' |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=February 3, 2018 |accessdate=February 4, 2018 |last=Memoli |first=Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stracqualursi"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/03/politics/nadler-democratic-rebuttal-nunes-memo/index.html |title=Judiciary Democrat's rebuttal to Nunes memo accuses House GOP of obstructing Russia probe |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=February 4, 2018 |accessdate=February 4, 2018 |last=Stracqualursi |first=Veronica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Schiff]] has stated that the "Nunes memo is designed to...["put the government on trial"] by furthering a conspiracy theory that a cabal of senior officials within the FBI and the Justice Department were so tainted by bias against President Donald Trump that they irredeemably poisoned the investigation."&lt;ref name="Schiff_2/1/2018"&gt;{{cite web |last=Schiff |first=Adam |title=The Nunes memo crosses a dangerous line |website=Chicago Tribune |date=February 1, 2018 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-devin-nunes-memo-fbi-20180201-story.html | access-date=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Revelations about the Nunes memo and its surrounding controversy, including speculation about the potential firing of Mueller or [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] Rod Rosenstein, gave rise to comparisons to the [[Saturday night massacre]], alluding to the firing of special prosecutor [[Archibald Cox]] by President [[Richard Nixon]] during the [[Watergate scandal]].&lt;ref name=Eisen&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/31/trumps-saturday-night-massacre-is-happening-right-before-our-eyes-216560 |title=Trump’s Saturday Night Massacre Is Happening Right Before Our Eyes |publisher=[[Politico]] |date=January 31, 2018 |accessdate=February 2, 2018 |last=Eisen |first=Norman |last2=Fredickson |first2=Caroline |last3=Bookbinder |first3=Noah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shalev&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/when-trump-fires-mueller-watergate-could-seem-like-child-s-play-1.5785790 |title=When Trump Fires Mueller, Watergate Could Seem Like Child's Play |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |date=February 2, 2018 |accessdate=February 2, 2018 |last=Shalev |first=Chemi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DavidSmith&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/02/trump-nunes-memo-republicans-nixon |title=Trump's release of Nunes memo is Nixonian – but today's GOP won't resist |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 2, 2018 |accessdate=February 2, 2018 |last=Smith |first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dartunorro&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/democrats-condemn-release-nunes-memo-n844146 |title=Democrats, some GOP lawmakers criticize release of Nunes memo |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=February 2, 2018 |accessdate=February 2, 2018 |last=Clark |first=Dartunorro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glenn Greenwald]] called the Republican-led campaign to release the memo "a bizarre spectacle" since the Republicans were "holding a document that only they can release, while pretending to be advocating for its release."&lt;ref name=vice/&gt;

In response to the release of Nunes's document, former FBI director [[James Comey]] wrote, "That's it? Dishonest and misleading memo wrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen. For what?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary |last=Papenfuss |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-comey-memo-response_us_5a74e663e4b0905433b42efc |title=An Angry James Comey On The GOP Memo: ‘That’s It?’ |work=HuffPost |date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In an interview on ''[[Meet the Press]]'', former [[director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA director]] [[John O. Brennan]] said that Nunes had presented only "one side, in a very selective, cherry-picked memo."  He said that for Nunes and the Republicans to deny the Democratic minority the ability to release their own memo "is just appalling, and it clearly underscores just how partisan Mr. Nunes has been." Brennan accused Nunes of an [[abuse of power]] in the use of his position on the House Intelligence Committee.  "I don't say that lightly," he added.&lt;ref&gt;Shane Harris, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nunesabused-his-power-on-intelligence-committee-former-cia-director-says/2018/02/04/59ff42c0-09c4-11e8-baf5-e629fc1cd21e_story.html Nunes 'abused' his power on intelligence committee, former CIA director says], ''Washington Post'' (February 4, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

Three former CIA analysts (Jeff Asher, Nada Bakos and Cindy Otis) wrote that the "politically motivated, recklessly drafted" Nunes memo "does not support its main thesis" alleging abuse by the FBI and Department of Justice regarding their investigation of Carter Page as it "doesn't offer any evidence of the potential abuse and, in fact, the memo undermines itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Asher |first1=Jeff |last2=Bakos |first2=Nada |last3=Otis |first3=Cindy |title=Former CIA analysts: We can't trust Devin Nunes |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/07/opinions/nunes-memo-opinion-asher-bakos-otis/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Sheldon Whitehouse]] has accused the authors of the memo of "using selective declassification as a tactic—they use declassified information to tell their side, and then the rebuttal is classified." [[Jane Mayer]] stated that this leaves [[Christopher Steele]]'s defenders no possibility "to respond without breaching national-security secrets".&lt;ref name="Mayer_3/12/2018"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mayer |first=Jane |title=Christopher Steele, the Man Behind the Trump Dossier |website=The New Yorker |date=March 12, 2018 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/christopher-steele-the-man-behind-the-trump-dossier | access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Rosensweig, former [[Assistant Secretary for International Affairs]] and former [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater]] investigator, has analyzed the Nunes memo and explained several reasons for why he believes "it makes no sense", is "not a serious effort at oversight", and "fails to make its case": the timing of the FISA warrant shows that any findings would first have come to light after the election and thus could not have affected it; Carter Page was no longer a member of the Trump campaign at the time of the application; it ignores that Page was under FISA surveillance as early as 2013 because of his proven Russian connections; the attempt to tie the October FISA application to Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein is flawed because Rosenstein was a U.S. attorney for the district of Maryland at the time and had nothing to do with that application; the memo "uses language that is intended to create a misimpression" by implying that the [[Trump–Russia dossier]] was central to the FISA application, when it was only a part of it; and that the memo "tries to bury" its "admission deep in the document", in the final paragraph, that the investigation into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]] was not triggered by the Steele dossier but by information from Trump advisor Papadopoulos.&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig_2/2/2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Rosenzweig | first=Paul | title=Even If You Take the Nunes Memo Seriously, It Makes No Sense | website=[[Politico]] | date=February 2, 2018 | url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/amp/story/2018/02/02/the-nunes-memo-makes-no-sense-216928 | access-date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release of Carter Page FISA warrant applications==
[[File:Optimized.pdf|thumb|Carter Page FISA warrant applications]]

On July 21, 2018, the Justice Department released heavily redacted versions of four FISA warrant applications for Carter Page which showed that key assertions made in the Nunes memo were false or misleading, corroborating the rebuttal made by Democrats.&lt;ref name="Savage"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/22/us/politics/how-a-trump-decision-revealed-a-gop-memos-shaky-foundation.html|title=How a Trump Decision Revealed a G.O.P. Memo’s Shaky Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nunes memo:

* Contended the application did not "disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign or any party/campaign in funding Steele’s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior DOJ and FBI officials,” an assertion Democrats disputed in their rebuttal. The application provided a page-length explanation that the person who commissioned Steele was “likely looking for information to discredit” the Trump campaign. The application also explained that, despite the political motives of those who commissioned Steele, the FBI found Steele credible.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Savage"/&gt;

* Faulted the application for not identifying Hillary Clinton or the DNC by name. However, the application showed the standard practice of omitting the names of American individuals and organizations. For example, Trump and Clinton were identified only as "Candidate #1" and "Candidate #2," respectively.&lt;ref name="Savage"/&gt;

* Asserted the DOJ referenced a ''Yahoo News'' article as corroboration of Steele's information, even though it later became known that Steele had been a source for the article, an assertion rebutted by Democrats. However, the application actually cited the ''Yahoo News'' article only to show that Carter Page had denied allegations against him, under a section entitled "Page’s Denial of Cooperation With the Russian Government."&lt;ref name="Savage"/&gt;

Multiple sources also noted that after its publication, the wiretap warrant was approved, and later renewed, four times by four different judges, all of whom were appointed by Republican presidents.&lt;ref name="Savage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Trump Administration Releases Classified Warrants For FBI Wiretap Of Carter Page|author=Daniella Cheslow|publisher=National Public Radio|date=July 22, 2018|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/07/22/631260082/trump-administration-releases-classified-warrants-for-fbi-wiretap-of-carter-page}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Chas|last1=Danner|accessdate=2018-07-25|title=Newly Disclosed FISA Applications Disprove ‘Witch Hunt’ Claims From Trump, Nunes|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/07/fisa-documents-dispel-witch-hunt-claims-from-trump-nunes.html|newspaper=Daily Intelligencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d9000216-8dc8-11e8-b639-7680cedcc421|title=Trump attacks ‘illegal’ surveillance of campaign aide|publisher=Financial Times|date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, all four judges — [[Rosemary M.

The day after the applications were released, Trump asserted without evidence that they confirmed the Justice Department and FBI had misled the FISA court and as a result his campaign had been illegally spied on to benefit the Clinton campaign. Trump also quoted conservative writer [[Andrew C. McCarthy|Andrew McCarthy]], who had called into question the integrity of the FISA court itself.&lt;ref name="lawandcrime.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/22/us/politics/trump-fisa-carter-page.html|title=Without Evidence, Trump Claims Vindication From Release of Carter Page Documents|publisher=|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RV ''Western Flyer''''' is a twin hulled [[SWATH]] [[research vessel]] operated by the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]] (MBARI). Its relatively stable SWATH design permits expanded operational capability in rough sea states. It is the platform of operations for the [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] ''Doc Ricketts''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mbari.org/at-sea/vehicles/remotely-operated-vehicles/rov-doc-ricketts/ |title=Vessels and Vehicles - ROV ''Doc Ricketts'' |website=[[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]] |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (named after [[Ed Ricketts]]). The vessel carries 10 crew, 5 ROV pilots, and 11 scientists, for a total complement of 26. Cruises generally center around the central California coast and [[Monterey Bay]], although excursions further afield to Hawaii, the Pacific Northwest, and the [[Gulf of California]] have taken place in recent years.

==Vessel description/ design characteristics==

===General arrangement===
Accommodations are provided for a combination of 26 crew members and scientists in 14 staterooms located on the upper deck. The crew complement is ten for all voyages and the combination of ROV staff and scientists (16) brings the total vessel complement to 26.

===Equipment and control/monitoring systems===
The main machinery plant is diesel electric with a common power bus connecting five generators. Any combination of generator operation will provide power for both propulsion and other vessel operations. This design arrangement provides a high level of machinery plant redundancy and operational flexibility. Propulsion power is transmitted through two duplicate drive trains, each consisting of a DC electric motor and fixed pitch propeller. Silicon controlled rectifiers (SCR's) are used to convert generated AC power to DC propulsive power. Two electric motor-driven bow thrusters are installed to enhance maneuvering and station-keeping.

'''Sailors' Snug Harbor''', also known as '''Sailors Snug Harbor,''' '''Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden''', and, informally, '''Snug Harbor''', is a collection of architecturally significant 19th-century buildings set in an 83-acre park along the [[Kill Van Kull]] on the north shore of [[Staten Island]] in [[New York City]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://snug-harbor.org/about-us/|publisher=Snug Harbor Cultural Center &amp; Botanical Garden|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was once a home for aged [[sailors]]. Some of the buildings and the grounds are used by arts organizations under the umbrella of the Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden.

Sailors' Snug Harbor includes 26 [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]], [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]], [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style buildings.

==History==
Snug Harbor was founded through a bequest after the death of Revolutionary War soldier and ship master Captain [[Robert Richard Randall]], namesake of the nearby neighborhood of [[Randall Manor, Staten Island|Randall Manor]].  Randall left his country estate in [[Manhattan]], bounded by Fifth Avenue, Broadway, 10th Street, and the southern side of 8th Street adjacent to what is now [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]], to build an institution to care for "aged, decrepit and worn-out" seamen. Randall's disappointed heirs contested the will extensively, delaying the opening of the sailors' home for decades. By the time the will challenge was settled, the once-rural land around the Manhattan estate had become well-developed.  Snug Harbor's trustees (appointed by Randall's will, they included the mayor of New York City, the president and vice president of the Marine Society, senior ministers of the Episcopal and Presbyterian Churches, the head of the Chamber of Commerce, and the chancellor of the State) decided to maximize the profits on the Manhattan property.  They changed the proposed site of the institution to another piece of land bequeathed by Randall: a 130-acre plot on Staten Island overlooking the Kill Van Kull.&lt;ref name="nypap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypap.org/content/sailors-snug-harbor-board-trustees|title=Sailors' Snug Harbor Board of Trustees|date=2014-02-19|work=|publisher=The New York Preservation Archive Project|quote=''The property originally belonged to Captain Robert Richard Randall, Revolutionary War soldier and ship master. . . .

Opting instead to maximize profits on the Manhattan property, Snug Harbor’s trustees relocated the proposed site to Staten Island . . . .''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sailors' Snug Harbor finally opened in 1833, the country's first home for retired merchant seamen. The residents were referred to as "inmates" in the parlance of the day. The institution began with a single building, now the centerpiece in the row of five Greek Revival temple-like buildings on the [[New Brighton, Staten Island|New Brighton]] waterfront.&lt;ref name=musichall&gt;{{cite news |first= Christopher|last= Gray|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Music Hall at Snug Harbor Cultural Center. A Low-Budget Revival for a Grand 1890 Theater |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E1D91339F934A35757C0A960958260&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=%22Snug%20Harbor%22&amp;st=cse |quote=Sailors' Snug Harbor was established in 1801 by the will of Robert Randall to care for "aged, decrepit and worn-out" seamen. For this he left most of his estate, including Manhattan property bounded by Fifth Avenue and Broadway and Eighth and 10th Streets. In 1833 the trustees of Sailors' Snug Harbor opened the first in a row of five temple-fronted buildings on the New Brighton waterfront on Staten Island. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=April 7, 1996 |accessdate=2008-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1867 to 1884, Captain [[Thomas Melville (captain)|Thomas Melville]], a retired sea captain and brother of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' author [[Herman Melville]], was governor of Snug Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Herman Melville: A Biography, by Hershel Parker, 1996, p. 651&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, Captain [[Gustavus Trask]], the governor of Snug Harbor, built a [[Renaissance Revival]] church, the [[Randall Memorial Chapel]] and, next to it, a music hall, both designed by [[Robert W. Gibson]].&lt;ref name=musichall/&gt; At its peak in the late 19th century, about 1,000 retired sailors lived at Snug Harbor, then one of the wealthiest charities in New York.  Its Washington Square area properties yielded a surplus exceeding the retirement home's costs by $100,000 a year.&lt;ref name=musichall/&gt;

By the mid-20th century, however, Snug Harbor was in financial difficulty.  Once-grand structures fell into disrepair, and some were demolished; the ornate white-marble Randall Memorial Church was torn down in 1952. With the arrival of the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] system in the 1930s, demand for accommodation for old sailors declined; by the mid-1950s, fewer than 200 residents remained.

In the 1960s, the institution's trustees proposed to redevelop the site with high-rise buildings; the new [[New York City Landmarks Commission]] stepped forward to save the remaining buildings, designating them landmark structures, and listing them on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. A series of legal battles ensued, but the validity of landmark designation was ultimately upheld and it was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: The Sailors' Snug Harbor|url={{NHLS url|id=72000909}}|author=Carolyn Pitts| date=August 3, 1976 |accessdate=2008-07-15|publisher=National Park Service|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}} and {{NHLS url|id=72000909|title=''Accompanying 9 photos and prints, from 1965 and undated.''|photos=y}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(3.53&amp;nbsp;MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the trustees moved the institution to [[Sea Level, North Carolina]] and sold the Staten Island site to the City of New York.&lt;ref name=musichall/&gt; Today, Randall's Trust no longer operates a retirement home, but [http://www.thesailorssnugharbor.org the Trustees of the Sailors' Snug Harbor in the City of New York] continues its work, using funds from the endowment to help mariners all over the country. 

On September 12, 1976, the Snug Harbor Cultural Center was opened to the public. In 2008, the Cultural Center and the Staten Island Botanical Garden merged to become the '''Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden'''.&lt;ref&gt;Merger opens a new era at Snug Harbor; Cultural Center unites with Botanical Garden, benefiting programs at the sprawling facility, June 29, 2008, by Michael J. Fressola, Staten Island Advance, http://www.silive.com/news/advance/index.ssf?/base/news/121473270678330.xml&amp;coll=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sailors' Snug Harbor Archives are preserved at the Stephen B. Luce Library at [[SUNY Maritime College]] in the Bronx.

A [[Sailors' Snug Harbor (Staten Island Railway station)|station]] on the now-defunct North Shore Branch of the [[Staten Island Railway]] bore the name Sailors Snug Harbor; a retaining wall and stairways from the station still exist. Now, the {{NYC bus link|S40}} travels from and to the [[St. George Terminal]], stopping at Snug Harbor's front gate.

== Architecture ==
[[File:SH 1000C NE jeh.jpg|thumb|left|Administration Building C]]
The five interlocking Greek Revival buildings at Snug Harbor are regarded as "the most ambitious moment of the classic revival in the United States" and the "most extraordinary" suite of Greek temple-style buildings in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Source Book of American Architecture: 500 Notable Buildings, by G. E. Kidder Smith, Paul Goldberger, 2000, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Built around the 1833 Building C, the buildings "form a symmetrical composition on Richmond Terrace, an eight-columned portico in the center and two six-columned porticoes on either end."&lt;ref name=dispute/&gt;

[[Paul Goldberger]] wrote, "Snug Harbor has something of the feel of a campus, something of the feel of a small-town square. Indeed, these rows of classical temples, set side-by-side with tiny connecting structures recessed behind the grand facades, are initially perplexing because they fit into no pattern we recognize &amp;mdash; they are lined up as if on a street, yet they are set in the landscape of a park. They seem at once to embrace the 19th-century tradition of picturesque design and, by virtue of their rigid linear order, to reject it."&lt;ref name=slow&gt;{{cite news |first= Paul|last= Goldberger|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Slow Stylish Redesign of Snug Harbor |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DB1731F936A35754C0A961948260&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=%22Snug%20Harbor%22&amp;st=cse |quote=It is not as famous as the ferry and it has not aroused tempers the way the one-way toll on the Verrazano Narrows Bridge has, but the struggle over Sailors Snug Harbor must still be Staten Island's epic drama. This collection of Greek Revival buildings, constructed in the 19th century as a retirement home for seamen, was almost torn down in the 1960s by the home's trustees, who wanted to replace the great row of templelike buildings with a high-rise structure; the city designated the complex a landmark, at which point the trustees went to court. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=July 5, 1987 |accessdate=2008-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All five buildings are individually landmarked, as are: the 131-year-old chapel, which has been renovated as a recital and concert space; the Italinate Richmond Terrace gate house (1873), the mid-19th-century iron fence surrounding the property, and the interiors of Building C and the chapel.&lt;ref name=dispute&gt;{{cite news |first= David W.|last= Dunlap|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dispute Grows |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DD163DF930A15750C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 |quote=Its centerpiece, Building C, was completed in 1833.

===Grounds===
The buildings are set in extensive, landscaped grounds, surrounded by an individually landmarked, 19th-century cast-iron fence. They include a "beautiful" 1893 zinc fountain featuring the god Neptune, now indoors with a replica in its place.  According to the New York Times, "He sits in the middle, astride a shell held aloft by sea monsters, his trident raised. Jets of water spurt from the fountain's center and from bouquets of metal calla lilies to its sides. Visitors to Snug Harbor stop and watch, sitting on benches surrounding the scene, while workmen eat their lunches. It is quiet. Noisy New York and its busy harbor only {{convert|200|ft|m}} away, beyond Richmond Terrace, might just as well be on Mars. Or at least at the other end of His Majesty's sea."&lt;ref name=dispute/&gt;

Also on the grounds is a bronze statue of Robert Randall by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]].

==Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden==

===Staten Island Children's Museum===
{{Main article|Staten Island Children's Museum}}
The '''Staten Island Children's Museum''' features a rotating collection of hands-on exhibits and an extensive year round live animal collection of exotic arthropods. The Children's Museum consists of the main building which was originally built in 1913 and the old snug harbor barn where the livestock was originally kept to feed the residents of Sailors Snug Harbor. When the museum was developed, a modern walkway was built connecting the two structures to create one museum building.

===Staten Island Museum===
{{Main article|Staten Island Museum}}
The Staten Island Museum opened a location at Snug Harbor in September 2015. After operating two locations for almost two years, the museum closed the St. George location and consolidated its operations to the current building, Building A, at Snug Harbor. The Museum hopes to expand to building B by 2022.&lt;ref name="siastg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Rob|title=Staten Island Museum closing in St. George, consolidating at Snug Harbor|url=http://www.silive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/04/staten_island_museum_closing_i_1.html|accessdate=31 July 2017|work=Staten Island Advance|date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art Lab ===
Art Lab is a school of fine and applied art, founded in 1975 and offering art instruction and exhibitions.  
[[File:SH Music Hall shaded jeh.jpg|thumb|left|Music Hall]]

===Music Hall===
A 686-seat Greek Revival auditorium,&lt;ref name=slow/&gt; the Music Hall hosts performing arts. It is the second-oldest music hall in New York City, having opened in July 1892 with a performance of a cantata, "The Rose Maiden." In attendance were some 600 residents of the home who sat on plain wooden seats, and 300 trustees and their guests who occupied the venue's upholstered balcony seats.&lt;ref name=musichall/&gt;&lt;ref name="snug harbor music hall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snug-harbor.org/|title=Snug Harbor Cultural Center &amp; Botanical Garden|work=Snug Harbor Cultural Center &amp; Botanical Garden|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="staten island attractions"&gt;(http://www.statenislandusa.com/pdf/StatenIslandAttractions.pdf) ''Molinaro, James P.

==Snug Harbor Cemetery==

The residents of sailors snug harbor were buried on the grounds in what was called "monkey hill". The location of the cemetery is across the road from the current snug harbor complex in Allison Pond Park which used to be part of the original snug harbor campus. The Lake in Alisons Park served as a water supply for the snug harbor facility until 1939.&lt;ref name="nycgovparks.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/R052/history|title=Allison Pond Park Highlights : NYC Parks|website=www.nycgovparks.org|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cemetery portion (surrounded by a red brick wall) is still owned by the Snug Harbor center while the remaining land was sold in 1975 to the city and turned into a public park with hiking trails.&lt;ref name="nycgovparks.org"/&gt;  The majority of the over thousand bodies (including those of military naval sailors) lay in unmarked graves because their headstones were removed in the 80's and put into a storage room on the main campus for "preservation".

==Murders and suicides ==

On January 30, 1863 at 9 A.M the chaplain of Snug Harbor, Reverend Robert Quinn was shot by a sailor resident named Herman Ingalls with a double barrel pistol outside the snug harbor chapel. Herman Ingalls then turned the firearm on himself and died at 10PM in the Snug Harbor hospital located on the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/01/news/murder-suicide-staten-island-chaplain-sailor-s-snug-harbor-shot-instantly-killed.html|title=MURDER AND SUICIDE ON STATEN ISLAND.; The Chaplain of the Sailor's Snug Harbor Shot and Instantly Killed by an Inmate of that Institution. Court of General Sessions. Before Judge McCunn.|date=1 February 1863|publisher=|accessdate=29 December 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local legend tells of a second murder that occurred in Snug Harbor. According to a persistent legend, a female matron was murdered in the matrons cottage on the grounds by her illegitimate son, who was later hanged as punishment. However unlike the Rev. Quinn murder in 1863, no ''official'' documentation has been found to support proof of the matron murder.

==In popular culture==

[[File:Sailors_Snug_Harbor_dancing_sailors-1-.jpg|thumb|Dancing sailors in ''Peter Pigeon of Snug Harbor'']]
In an 1898 article in [[Ainslee's Magazine]], "When The Sails Are Furled: Sailor's Snug Harbor," the soon-to-be-famous novelist [[Theodore Dreiser]] provided an amusing non-fiction account of the obstreperous and frequently intoxicated residents of Snug Harbor.

'''Sanskritisation''' (Indian English) or '''Sanskritization''' (American English, Oxford spelling) is a particular form of social change found in [[India]]. It denotes the process by which [[caste|caste or tribe]]s placed lower in the caste hierarchy seek upward mobility by emulating the [[ritual]]s and practices of the upper or dominant castes. It is a process similar to [[Passing (sociology)|passing]] in [[Sociology|sociological]] terms.  This term was made popular by Indian sociologist [[M. N. Srinivas]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Charsley, S. (1998) "Sanskritization: The Career of an Anthropological Theory"  ''Contributions to Indian Sociology'' 32(2): p. 527 citing Srinivas, M.N. (1952) ''Religion and Society Amongst the Coorgs of South India'' Clarendon Press, Oxford.  See also, Srinivas, M. N.; Shah, A. M.; Baviskar, B. S.; and Ramaswamy, E. A. (1996) ''Theory and method: Evaluation of the work of M.N. Srinivas'' Sage, New Delhi, {{ISBN|81-7036-494-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Christophe Jaffrelot]] a similar heuristic is described in ''[[Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development]]'' by [[Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar| B. R. Ambedkar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jaffrelot|2005}}, pp. 33, notes that "Ambedkar advanced the basis of one of the most heuristic of concepts in modern Indian Studies—the Sanskritization process—that M. N. Srinivas was to introduce 40 years later."&lt;/ref&gt; Jaffrelot goes on to say, "While the term was coined by Srinivas, the process itself had been described by colonial administrators such as [[Edwin Felix Thomas Atkinson|E. T. Atkinson]] in his ''Himalayan Gazetteer'' and [[Alfred Comyn Lyall|Alfred Lyall]], in whose works Ambedkar might well have encountered it."{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2005|p=33}}

Srinivas defined sanskritisation as a process by which "a ''low'' or ''middle'' Hindu caste, or [[tribe|tribal]] or other group, changes its customs, ritual ideology, and way of life in the direction of a high and frequently ''[[dwija|twice-born]]'' caste. Generally such changes are followed by a claim to a higher position in the caste hierarchy than that traditionally conceded to the claimant class by the local community ... ."&lt;ref name="Jayapalan2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=N. Jayapalan|title=Indian society and social institutions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AumuJ2jtRZIC&amp;pg=PA428|accessdate=17 January 2013|year=2001|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distri|isbn=978-81-7156-925-0|page=428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One clear example of sanskritisation is the adoption, in emulation of the practice of [[dwija|twice-born castes]], of [[vegetarianism]] by people belonging to the so-called "low castes" who are traditionally not averse to non-vegetarian food.

[[Vishwakarma (caste)|Vishwakarma Caste]] claim to Brahmin status is not generally accepted outside the community, despite their assumption of some high-caste traits, such as wearing the [[sacred thread]], and the Brahminisation of their rituals. For example, the sociologist [[M. N. Srinivas]], who developed the concept of sanskritisation, juxtaposed the success of the [[Lingayat]] caste in achieving advancement within [[Karnataka]] society by such means with the failure of the Vishwakarma to achieve the same. Their position as a [[Idangai|left-hand caste]] has not aided their ambition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Modern Anthropology of India: Ethnography, Themes and Theory |first=Aya |last=Ikegame |chapter=Karnataka: Caste, dominance and social change in the 'Indian village' |editor1-first=Peter |editor1-last=Berger |editor2-first=Frank |editor2-last=Heidemann |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |page=128 |isbn=9781134061112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sBgLb8XIGR8C&amp;pg=PA128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to M.N. Srinivas, Sanskritisation is not just the adoption of new customs and habits, but also includes exposure to new ideas and values appearing in Sanskrit literature.  He says the words ''[[Karma]], [[dharma]], [[Sin#Hindu views of sin|paap]], [[Maya (illusion)|maya]], [[samsara]] and [[moksha]]'' are the most common Sanskritic theological ideas which become common in the talk of people who are sanskritised.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivas, Mysore Narasimhachar (1962) ''Caste in Modern India: And other essays'' Asia Publishing House, Bombay, page 48, {{OCLC|5206379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon has also been observed in [[Nepal]] among [[Khas]], [[Magar people|Magar]], [[Newar]] and [[Tharu people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Theory==
M.N. Srinivas first propounded this theory in his [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] thesis at [[Oxford University]]. The thesis was later brought out as a book titled ''Religion and Society Among the Coorgs of South India.'' Published in 1952, the book was an [[ethnography|ethnographical]] study of the [[Kodava people|Kodava (Coorgs)]] community of [[Karnataka]]. M.N. Srinivas writes in the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The caste system is far from a rigid system in which the position of each component caste is fixed for all time. Movement has always been possible, and especially in the '' middle regions of the hierarchy''. A caste was able, in a generation or two, to rise to a higher position in the hierarchy by adopting vegetarianism and teetotalism, and by Sanskritising its ritual and pantheon. In short, it took over, as far as possible, the customs, rites, and beliefs of the Brahmins, and adoption of the Brahminic way of life by a low caste seems to have been frequent, though theoretically forbidden. This process has been called 'Sanskritisation' in this book, in preference to 'Brahminisation', as certain Vedic rites are confined to the Brahmins and the two other 'twice-born' castes."&lt;ref&gt;Srinivas, M.N. (1952) ''Religion and Society Amongst the Coorgs of South India'' Clarendon Press, Oxford, page 32, {{OCLC|15999474}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The book challenged the then prevalent idea that caste was a rigid and unchanging institution. The concept of sanskritisation addressed the actual complexity and fluidity of caste relations. It brought into academic focus the dynamics of the renegotiation of status by various castes and communities in India.

[[Yogendra Singh]] has critiqued the theory as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"... Sanskritisation fails to account for many aspects of cultural changes in the past and contemporary India as it neglects non-sanskritic traditions. It may be noted that often a non-sanskritic element of culture may be a localised form of sanskritic tradition. ... Sanskritic rites are often added to non-sanskritic rites without replacing them."&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Yogendra. (1994). ''Modernization of Indian Tradition'' (A Systematic Study of Social Change), Jaipur, Rawat Publications, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sinicization''', '''sinicisation''', '''sinofication''', or '''sinification''' is a process whereby non-Chinese societies come under the influence of Chinese culture, particularly Han Chinese culture and societal norms. Areas of influence include diet, writing, industry, education, language, law, lifestyle, politics, philosophy, religion, science and technology, culture, and value systems. More broadly, "Sinicization" may refer to policies of acculturation, assimilation, or cultural imperialism imposed by China onto neighboring East Asian countries. Evidence of this can be seen in the value systems, cuisine, architectural style, and lexicons. This is reflected in the histories of Japan, Korea and Vietnam for example, in the [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|adoption of the Chinese writing system]] as [[Written Chinese|the script]] of the Han Chinese has long been a unifying feature in the [[Sinosphere]] as the vehicle for exporting Chinese culture to these Asian countries.

==Integration==
The integration policy is a type of nationalism aimed at strengthening of the Chinese identity among population. Proponents believe integration will help to develop shared values, pride in being the country’s citizen, respect and acceptance towards cultural differences among citizens of China. Critics argue that integration destroys ethnic diversity, language diversity, and cultural diversity. Analogous to North America with approximately 300 Native American languages and distinct ethnic groups, in China there are 292 non-Mandarin languages spoken by native peoples of the region. [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CN] There are also a number of immigrant languages, such as Khmer, Portuguese, English, etc.

==Historical examples of sinicization==
===Austronesian peoples===
Before sinicization, non-Chinese indigenous peoples of Southern China, termed collectively by the Chinese as [[Baiyue]] inhabited the coastline of China from as far north as the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] to as far south as the [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. Analysis of DNA recovered from human remains shows high frequencies of [[Haplogroup O1]] in [[Liangzhu culture]] linking this culture to modern Austronesian populations. It is believed that Liangzhu culture was the ancestral homeland of Proto-Austronesian populations before they [[Austronesian hypothesis|spread to Taiwan]]. Over time, the southward spread of Han Chinese led to the sinicization of most of the Baiyue populations that remained in Southern China, whether in the [[Yangtze]] Valley or in coastal areas from the mouth of the Yangtze to the Gulf of Tonkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Prehistoric Settlement of the Pacific, Volume 86, Part 5|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XiELAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=in+the+southward+spread+of+Han+Chinese+led+to+the+sinicization+of+all+AN-speakers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=63CBU6-TG4qD8gWKqIGwBQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20the%20southward%20spread%20of%20Han%20Chinese%20led%20to%20the%20sinicization%20of%20all%20AN-speakers&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remnants of these peoples who were not sinicized are now recognized officially as the [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]] of the [[China|PRC]].

===Turkic peoples===

Descendants of [[Uyghurs]] who migrated to [[Taoyuan County, Hunan]] have largely assimilated into the Han Chinese and [[Hui people|Hui]] population and practice Chinese customs, speaking Chinese as their language.

===Tang dynasty===
During the 8th and 9th centuries in the [[Tang dynasty]], Chinese male soldiers moved into [[Guizhou]] (Kweichow) and married native non-Chinese women, their descendants being known as ''Lao-han-jen'' (original Chinese), in contrast to new Chinese people who colonized Guizhou at later times. They still speak an archaic dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eG8cAAAAMAAJ&amp;q|title=Scottish geographical magazine, Volumes 45–46|author=Scottish Geographical Society|year=1929|publisher=Royal Scottish Geographical Society.|location=|isbn=|page=70|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many immigrants to Guizhou were descended from these soldiers in garrisons who married non-Chinese women.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqcSAAAAIAAJ&amp;q|title=The Cowrie Shell Miao of Kweichow, Volume 32, Issue 1|author=Margaret Portia Mickey|year=1947|publisher=The Museum|location=|isbn=|page=6|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yuan dynasty===

The Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] appointed a Muslim from [[Bukhara]], [[Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar]], as governor of [[Yunnan]] after conquering the [[Kingdom of Dali]]. Sayyid Ajjall then promoted Sinicization and Confucianization of the non-Han Chinese peoples in Yunnan during his reign. Sayyid Ajjal founded a "Chinese style" city where modern [[Kunming]] is today, called Zhongjing Cheng. He ordered that a [[Buddhist temple]], a [[Confucian temple]], and two [[mosque]]s be built in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond the Great Wall: Urban Form and Transformation on the Chinese Frontiers|first=Piper Rae|last=Gaubatz|volume=|edition=illustrated|year=1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drGGEsi1fFEC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=sichuan+ajall+yuan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6CY6Pid91W&amp;sig=o5oKGyZwlv4v6fkiBiIGmhuewUM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AaPTU_qKB5LfsAT4wIGYBQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sichuan%20ajall%20yuan&amp;f=false|page=78|isbn=0804723990|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocating Confucianism was part of his policy.

===Ming dynasty===
{{cleanup-section|reason=The content should be more related to the topic of the article (sinicization)|date=February 2015}}
{{main article|Ming conquest of Yunnan|Miao Rebellions (Ming Dynasty)}}
Massive military campaigns were launched by the [[Ming dynasty]] during the [[Miao Rebellions (Ming Dynasty)|Miao Rebellions]] against the southern indigenous [[Miao people|Miao]], [[Yao people|Yao]], and other tribes, settled thousands of Han and Hui in their land after exterminating most of the former indigenous tribes.

During the [[Ming conquest of Yunnan]] Chinese military soldiers were settled in Yunnan, and many married the native women.

===Qing dynasty===
The [[Manchu people]] became the rulers during the [[Qing dynasty]]. The "orthodox" historical view emphasized the power of [[Han Chinese]] to "sinicize" their conquerors, although more recent research such as the [[New Qing History]] school revealed Manchu rulers were savvy in their manipulation of their subjects and from the 1630s through at least the 18th century, the emperors developed a sense of Manchu identity and used [[Central Asia]]n models of rule as much as [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ones. There is however evidence of sinicization. For example, Manchus originally had their own separate style of naming from the Han Chinese, but eventually adopted Han Chinese naming practices.

Manchu names consisted of more than the two or one syllable Chinese names, and when phonetically transcribed into Chinese, they made no sense at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|quote=famous Manchu figure of the early Qing who belonged to the Niohuru clan) would have been the unwieldy "Niu-gu-lu E-bi-long" in Chinese. Moreover, the characters used in names were typically chosen to represent the sounds of Manchu, and not to carry any particular meaning in Chinese. For educated Han Chinese accustomed to names composed of a familiar surname and one or two elegang characters drawn from a poem or a passage from the classics, Manchu names looked not just different, but absurd. What was oneo to make of a name like E-bi-long, written in Chinese characters meaning "repress-must flourish," or Duo-er-gun, meaning "numerous-thou-roll"? S.... To them they looked like nonsense.... But they are not nonsense in Manchu: "E-bi-long" is the transcription of ebilun, meaning "a delicate or sickly child," and "Duo-er-gun" is the Chinese transcription of dorgon, the Manchu word for badger.|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&amp;pg=PA242#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=0-8047-4684-2|page=242|title=The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|edition=illustrated, reprint|author=Mark C. Elliott|accessdate=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the names that Manchus used were also very different from the meanings of Chinese names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|quote=Thus we find names like Nikan (Chinese), Ajige (little), Asiha (young), Haha (nale), Mampi (knot—a reference to the hair?), Kara (black), Fulata (red-eyed), Necin (peaceful), Kirsa (steppe fox), Unahan (colt), Jumara (squirrel), Nimašan (sea eagle), Nomin (lapis lazuli), and Gacuha (toy made out of an animal's anklebone).44 Names such as Jalfungga (long-lived), Fulingga (lucky one), Fulungga (majestic), and Hūturingga (fortunate), were not unknown, either, particularly after the seventeenth century.

Elliott|accessdate=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manchus also gave numbers as personal names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|quote=While Chinese names, too, sometimes ended in characters with the sounds "zhu," "bao," and "tai," more often than not, such names in the Qing belonged to Manchus and other bannermen (Chinese bannermen and Mongols sometimes took Manchu-sounding names), even if the attached meaning is not clear (it is not certain that all names in fact had a specific meaning). Giving "numeral names" was another unique Manchu habit. These were names that actually referred to numbers. Sometimes they were given using Manchu numbers—for example, Nadanju (seventy) or Susai (fifty). Other times number names used the Manchu transcriptions of Chinese numbers, as in the name Loišici (= Liushi qi, "sixty-seven"), Bašinu (= bashi wu, "eight-five").45 Such names, unheard of among the Han, were quite common among the Manchus, an appeared from time to time among Chinese bannermen. Popular curiosity about this odd custom in Qing was partly satisfied by the nineteenth-century bannerman-writer Fu-ge, who explained in his book of "jottings" that naming children for their grandparents' ages was a way of wishing longevity to the newly born.46|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=0-8047-4684-2|page=243|title=The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|edition=illustrated, reprint|author=Mark C.

They gave their children Chinese names, which were separate from the Manchu names, and even adopted the Chinese practice of [[generation name]]s, although its usage was inconsistent and error ridden, eventually they stopped using Manchu names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2001|publisher=University of Washington Press|quote=At Xiuyan, in eastern Fengtian, the Manchus in the seventh or eighth generation continued as before to give their sons polysyllabic Manchu personal names that were meaningless when transliterated into Chinese, but at the same time they began to also give them Chinese names that were disyllabic and meaningful and that conformed to the generational principle. Thus, in the seventh generation of the Gūwalgiya lineage were sons with two names, one Manchu and one Chinese, such as Duolunbu/Shiman, Delinbu/Shizhu, and Tehengbu/Shizhen. Within the family and the banner, these boys used their Manchu name, but outside they used their Han-style name. Then, from the eight or ninth generation one, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Gūwalgiya at Xiuyan stopped giving polysyllabic Manchu names to their sons, who thereafter used Chinese names exclusively.|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tgq1miGno-4C&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=56|title=Manchus &amp; Han: ethnic relations and political power in late Qing and early republican China, 1861–1928|edition=reprint, illustrated|author=Edward J.

Although the Manchus replaced their Manchu names with Chinese personal names, the [[Eight Banners|Manchu bannermen]] followed their traditional practice in typically used their first/personal name to address themselves and not their last name, while Han Chinese bannermen used their last name and first in normal Chinese style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2001|publisher=University of Washington Press|quote=Manchu men had abandoned their original polysyllabic personal names infavor of Han-style disyllabic names; they had adopted the Han practice of choosing characters with auspicious meanings for the names; and they had assigned names on a generational basis....

Usage of surnames was not traditional to the Manchu while it was to the Han Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|quote=Chinese names consist typically of a single-character surname and a given name of one or two characters, the latter usually chosen for their auspicious meaning. Manchu names were different. For one thing, Manchus did not commonly employ surnames, identifying themselves usually by their banner affiliation rather than by their lineage. Even if they had customarily used both surname and given name, this would not have eliminated the difference with Han names, since Manchu names of any kind were very often longer than two characters—that is, two syllables— in length.

=== Xinjiang ===
The Hui Muslim [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]] governed southern Xinjiang in 1934–1937. The administration that was set up was colonial in nature, putting up street signs and names in Chinese, which used to be in only [[Uyghur language|Uighur]] language. They lived much like Han Chinese, importing Han cooks and baths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=ma+hushan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KzhNeXbjkT&amp;sig=raCQibpp88Cf8Unpi8k-7jcQM-k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xCcqTPnrCoGBlAfV5rzmAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&amp;q=chinese%20a%20life%20cooks%20baths&amp;f=false|title=Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911–1949|author=Andrew D.

=== Taiwan ===
After the Republic of China took control of [[Taiwan]] in 1945 and relocated its capital to [[Taipei]] in 1949, the intention of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was to eventually go back to [[mainland China]] and retake control of it. Chiang believed that to retake mainland China, it would be necessary to re-Sinicize Taiwan's inhabitants who had undergone assimilation under Japanese rule. Examples of this policy included the renaming of streets with mainland geographical names, use of Mandarin Chinese in schools and punishments for using other regional languages, and teaching students to revere traditional ethics, develop pan-Chinese nationalism, and view Taiwan from the perspective of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = June Teufel | last = Dreyer | title = Taiwan’s Evolving Identity | url = http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=events.event_summary&amp;event_id=31149 Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars | location = Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars | quote = In order to shore up his government’s legitimacy, Chiang set about turning Taiwan’s inhabitants into Chinese. To use Renan’s terminology, Chiang chose to re-define the concept of shared destiny to include the mainland. Streets were re-named; major thoroughfares in Taipei received names associated with the traditional Confucian virtues. The avenue passing in front of the foreign ministry en route to the presidential palace was named chieh-shou (long life), in Chiang’s honor. Students were required to learn Mandarin and speak it exclusively; those who disobeyed and spoke Taiwanese Min, Hakka, or aboriginal tongues could be fined, slapped, or subjected to other disciplinary actions. | date = July 17, 2003 | accessdate = May 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/17827189.html|quote=The new KMT concluded that it must “Sinicize” Taiwan if it were ever to unify mainland China.

The government initiated educational reform in the 1950s to achieve a number of high-priority goals. First, it was done to help root out fifty years of Japanese colonial influence on the island's populace--"resinicizing" them, one might say- -and thereby guarantee their loyalty to the Chinese motherland. Second, the million mainlanders or so who had fled to Taiwan themselves had the age-old tendency of being more loyal to city, county, or province than to China as a nation. They identified themselves as Hunanese, Cantonese, or Sichuanese first, and as Chinese second.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of re-asserting non-Chinese identity, as in the case of ethnic groups in Taiwan, is sometimes known as [[desinicization]].

=== Tibet ===
{{Main article|Sinicization of Tibet}}
The sinicization of Tibet is the change of Tibetan society to Han Chinese standards, by means of cultural assimilation, [[immigration]], and political reform.&lt;ref&gt;Burbu, Dawa (2001) ''China's Tibet Policy'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-7007-0474-3}}, pp. 100–124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Samdup"&gt;Samdup, Tseten (1993) [http://www.tibet.com/Humanrights/poptrans.html Chinese population—Threat to Tibetan identity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712112116/http://www.tibet.com/HumanRights/poptrans.html |date=2009-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In some forms of fiction, due to China's [[communist state]]hood, Soviet-themed characters are de-[[Sovietization|Sovietized]] and switched over to become Chinese to fit modern (post-[[Cold War]]) times. The original cut of the 2012 ''[[Red Dawn (2012 film)|Red Dawn]]'' remake depicted a Chinese invasion before having said information leaked to the ''Global Times'', sparking controversy in China and threatening its airing in the country (the invaders were changed to North Koreans).&lt;ref name="Red Dawn Villains Switced"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schrader|first1=Chris|title='Red Dawn' Villains Switched from China to North Korea|url=http://screenrant.com/red-dawn-villains-china-north-korea-schrad-106177/|website=Screen Rant|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Chinese versions of the [[Crimson Dynamo#Ultimate Crimson Dynamo|Crimson Dynamo]] and the [[Abomination (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Abomination]] were created and made members of the ''Liberators'' in [[Marvel Comics]], the comic book ''[[The Ultimates 2]]''.

'''Smithsonian trinomials''' are [[unique identifier]]s assigned to [[archaeological site]]s in many states in the [[United States]]. They are composed of one or two digits coding for the state, typically two letters coding for the [[County (United States)|county]] or [[county-equivalent]] within the state, and one or more sequential digits representing the order in which the site was listed in that county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Site Records| url=http://www.utexas.edu/research/tarl/records/site.php| publisher=Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory |accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Site Forms| url= http://shapiro.anthro.uga.edu/GASF/siteform.html |publisher=University of Georgia Anthropology Department |accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smithsonian Institution developed the site number system in the 1930s and 1940s. (Trinomials are now assigned by the individual states.) The 48 states then in the union were assigned numbers in alphabetical order. Alaska was assigned number 49 and Hawaii was assigned number 50 after those states were admitted to the union. There are no Smithsonian trinomial numbers assigned for the District of Columbia or any United States territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archaeological Collections Management: Old Washington State Park, Washington, Hempstead County, Arkansas|url=http://projectpast.org/HWSP/cande_and_brandon99.pdf|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Abbreviation for Archaeological Site Number Designation based on the Smithsonian Institution River Basin Survey of the 1940s |url= http://bama.ua.edu/~alaarch/excavationsteps/stateabbreviations.htm| accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states use trinomials of the form "nnAAnnnn", but some specify a space or dash between parts of the identifier, i.e., "nn AA nnnn" or "nn-AA-nnnn". Some states use variations of the trinomial system. Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island and Vermont use two-letter abbreviations of the state name instead of the Smithsonian number. Alaska uses three-letter abbreviations for USGS map quadrangles in place of the county code. Arizona uses a five-part identifier based on USGS maps, specifying quadrangles, then rectangles within a quadrangle, a sequential number within the rectangle, and a code identifying the agency issuing the sequential number. California uses a three-letter abbreviation for counties. Connecticut and Rhode Island do not use any sub-state codes, with site identifiers consisting of the state abbreviation and a sequential number series for the whole state. Delaware uses a single letter code for counties and adds a block code (A-K) within each county, with sequential numbers for each block. Hawaii uses a four-part identifier, "50" for the state, a two-digit code for the island, then a two-digit code to designate the USGS topographical quad, plus a four digit sequential site number for sites on each island.

'''Social distance''' describes the [[distance#Theoretical distances|distance]] between different [[Social group|group]]s in [[society]] and is opposed to [[distance#Physical distances|''locational distance'']]&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2016. Proximity, subjectivity, and space: Rethinking distance in human geography. Geoforum, 75, pp. 249-252. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.07.018 &lt;/ref&gt;. The notion includes differences such as [[social class]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]/[[ethnicity]], [[gender]] or [[human sexuality|sexuality]], but also the fact that the different groups mix less than members of the same group&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J.A., McPherson, M. and Smith-Lovin, L., 2014. Social distance in the United States: Sex, race, religion, age, and education homophily among confidants, 1985 to 2004. American Sociological Review, 79(3), pp.432-456.&lt;/ref&gt;. The term is often applied in [[city|cities]], but its use is not limited to that. 

An old concept, in 1924 [[Robert Ezra Park|Robert E. Park]] defined social distance as "an attempt to reduce to something like measurable terms the grade and degrees of understanding and intimacy which characterizes personal and social relations generally".&lt;ref&gt;Park, R. E. (1924). The concept of social distance as applied to the study of racial attitudes and racial relations. Journal of Applied Sociology, 8, 339-344.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the measure of nearness or intimacy that an individual or group feels towards another individual or group in a social network or the level of trust one group has for another and the extent of perceived likeness of beliefs..&lt;ref&gt;Boguna, Marian, Romualdo Pastor-Satorras, Albert Díaz-Guilera, and Alex Arenas (2004). 
Models of social networks based on social distance attachment. Physical Review, 70, 1-8.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helfgott, Jacqueline B. &amp; Gunnison, Elaine (2008). The influence of social distance on 
community corrections officer perceptions of offender reentry needs. Federal Probation, 
72(1), 2-12.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of social distance as applied to the study of racial attitudes and racial relations. Journal of Applied Sociology, 8, 339-344.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[sociology|sociological]] literature, social distance is conceptualized in several different ways.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Karakayali, Nedim. 2009. "Social Distance and Affective Orientations." ''Sociological Forum'', vol. 23, n.3, pp. 538-562.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Affective social distance: One widespread conception of social distance focuses on [[negative affectivity|affectivity]]. According to this approach, social distance is associated with affective distance, i.e. how much sympathy the members of a group feel for another group. [[Emory Bogardus]], the creator of "Bogardus social distance scale" was typically basing his scale on this [[subjectivity|subjective-affective]] conception of social distance: "[i]n social distance studies the center of attention is on the feeling reactions of persons toward other persons and toward groups of people."&lt;ref&gt;Bogardus, E. S. 1947. ''Measurement of Personal-Group Relations,'' ''Sociometry'', 10: 4: 306–311.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Normative social distance: A second approach views social distance as a [[social norm|normative]] category. Normative social distance refers to the widely accepted and often consciously expressed norms about who should be considered as an [[ingroup|"insider"]] and who an [[Outgroup (sociology)|"outsider/foreigner".]] Such norms, in other words, specify the distinctions between "us" and "them". Therefore, normative social distance differs from affective social distance, because it conceives social distance is conceived as a [[Objectivity (science)|non-subjective]], [[social structure|structural]] aspect of social relations. Examples of this conception can be found in some of the works of sociologists such as [[Georg Simmel]], [[Emile Durkheim]] and to some extent [[Robert E. Park|Robert Park]].
#Interactive social distance: A third conceptualization of social distance focuses on the frequency and intensity of interactions between two groups, claiming that the more the members of two groups interact, the closer they are socially. This conception is similar to the approaches in [[social network|sociological network]] theory, where the frequency of interaction between two parties is used as a measure of the "strength" of the social ties between them.
#Cultural and Habitual Distance: A fourth conceptualization of social distance focuses cultural and habitual which is proposed by Bourdieu (1990). This type of distance is influenced by the "capital" people possess.  

It is possible to view these different conceptions as "dimensions" of social distance, that do not necessarily overlap. The members of two groups might interact with each other quite frequently, but this does not always mean that they will feel "close" to each other or that normatively they will consider each other as the members of the same group. In other words, interactive, normative and affective dimensions of social distance might not be linearly associated.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

Social distance was also used in a different meaning by [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and cross-cultural researcher, [[Edward T. Hall]], to describe the psychological distance which an animal can stand to be away from its group before beginning to feel [[anxiety|anxious]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, E. 1982. "The Hidden Dimension" 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon can be seen in human babies and toddlers who can only walk or crawl so far from their parents or guardians before becoming anxious and quickly returning to the safe space. The babies' social distance is quite small.

Hall also notes that this concept of social distance has been extended by technological advances such as the [[telephone]], [[walkie talkie]], and [[television]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, E. 1982. "The Hidden Dimension" 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall’s analysis of social distance came before the development of the [[internet]], which has expanded social distance exponentially. Social distance is now even expanding beyond our planet as we send people into outer space on space missions and even personal trips to space.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Prejudice==

It is said|date=June 2016}} that every individual regards his or her own [[culture]] as being superior to all other cultures, and other cultures as being inferior due to their differences from his or her own culture.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The social distance between two cultures may ultimately manifest in the form of hatred.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} A consequence of this distance and hatred is [[prejudice|prejudices]], that different cultural groups assume to be true for differing social groups.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} For example, the [[Brahmin|Brahmins]] are believed to possess the highest, and the [[Shudra|shudras]] the lowest [[Social status|status]] in [[Hindu caste system|Hindu society]]. If a Brahmin child ever touches the child of some shudra, the former is given a bath to rid him of his supposed defilement caused by his touch. As a result of this strict formulation of his activities, the Brahmin child forms a prejudice in his mind that shudras are untouchable and impure.&lt;ref name="Social Psychology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma, Rajendra|first=Sharma, Rachana|title=Social Psychology|year=1972|publisher=Atlantic Publishers and distributors|location=New Delhi|pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ways to study social distance==
Some ways social distance can be [[measurement|measured]] include: direct observation of people interacting, questionnaires, speeded decision making tasks, route planning exercises, or other social drawing tasks (see [[sociogram]]).

In questionnaires, respondents are typically asked members of which groups they would accept in particular relationships. For example, to check whether or not they would accept a member of each group as a neighbor, as a fellow worker as a marriage partner. The social distance questionnaires may not accurately measure what people actually would do if a member of another group sought to become a friend or neighbour. The social distance scale is only an attempt to measure one's feeling of unwillingness to associate equally with a group. What a person will actually do in a situation also depends upon the circumstances of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sociologyguide.com/basic-concepts/Social-Distance.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In speeded decision making tasks, studies have suggested a systematic relationship between social distance and physical distance. When asked to either indicate the spatial location of a presented word or verify a word’s presence, people respond more quickly when "we" was displayed in a spatially proximate versus spatially distant location and when "others" was displayed in a
spatially distant versus a spatially proximate location.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Anan, Y., Liberman, N., Trope, Y., &amp; Algom, D. (2007). Automatic processing of psychological distance: Evidence from a Stroop task. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 136,'' 610-622.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that social distance and physical distance are conceptually related.

Route planning exercises have also hinted at a conceptual link between social distance and physical distance. When asked to draw a route on a map, people tend to draw routes closer to friends they pass along the way and further away from strangers.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, J.L. &amp; Matlock, T. (2011). Understanding the link between spatial distance and social distance. ''Social Psychology, 42'', 185-192. {{doi|10.1027/1864-9335/a000062}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is robust even after controlling for how easy it is for the people passing one another to communicate. 

There is some evidence that reasoning about social distance and physical distance draw on shared processing resources in the human parietal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Yamakawa, Y., Kanai, R., Matsumura, M., &amp; Naito, E. (2009). Social distance evaluation in human parietal cortex. PLoS ONE, 4(2): e4360. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0004360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Core-periphery structure|Social periphery]]'' is a term often used in conjunction with social distance. It refers to people being 'distant' with regard to social relations. It is often implied that it is measured from the dominant ''city élite''. The social periphery of a city is often located in the [[city center|centre]].

''Locational periphery'' in contrast is used to describe places physically distant from the heart of the city. These places often include [[suburbia|suburbs]] which are socially close to the core of the city. In some cases the locational periphery overlaps with the social periphery, such as in [[Paris]]' ''[[banlieu|banlieues]]''.

In 1991, Mulgan stated that "The centres of two cities are often for practical purposes closer to each other than to their own peripheries."&lt;ref&gt;Mulgan G (1991) Communications and Control: Networks and the New Economics of Communication (Polity, Cambridge)&lt;/ref&gt; This reference to social distance is especially true for [[global cities]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6509">{{Wiktionary|subpoena|subpœna}}
A '''subpoena''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|p|iː|n|ə}}; also '''subpœna''' or '''supenna''') or '''witness summons''' is a [[writ]] issued by a government agency, most often a court, to compel testimony by a witness or production of evidence under a penalty for failure. There are two common types of subpoena:
# ''[[subpoena ad testificandum]]'' orders a person to testify before the ordering authority or face punishment. The subpoena can also request the testimony to be given by phone or in person.
# ''[[subpoena duces tecum]]'' orders a person or organization to bring physical evidence before the ordering authority or face punishment. This is often used for requests to mail copies of documents to requesting party or directly to court.

==Etymology==
[[File:Subpoena usgs.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Example of subpoena in the case ''[[Anderson v. Cryovac]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/woburn/resources/trial_documents.html |title=Example Copy of Subpoena in Anderson v. Cryovac landmark case}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The term ''subpoena'' is from the [[Middle English]] ''suppena'' and the Latin phrase ''sub [[poena]]'' meaning "under penalty".&lt;ref&gt;[[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's]] New Collegiate Dictionary, p. 1160 (8th ed. 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also spelled "subpena".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{usc|18|1429}}; {{uscsub|18|3333|c|1}}; {{uscsub|18|1968|c}}; and {{usc|28|1365}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The subpoena has its source in [[English law|English common law]] and it is now used almost with universal application throughout the English common law world. [[John Waltham]], [[Bishop of Salisbury]], is said to have created the writ of subpoena in the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curtis|first1=John|title=A School and College History of England|date=1860|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall and Co.|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s71XAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=subpoena+power+originated+king+richard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KQh4HiLYts&amp;sig=oO-B-GLLiZdOkeLuMb3DNC1k0Zg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi47MKs3c_TAhVJ8IMKHVgfCJQQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=subpoena%20power%20originated%20king%20richard&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for civil proceedings in England and Wales, it is now described as a '''witness summons''', as part of reforms to replace Latin terms with [[Plain English]] understandable to the layman.

==Process==
=== United States ===
Subpoenas are usually issued by the clerk of the court in the name of the judge presiding over the case. Additionally, court rules may permit lawyers to issue subpoenas themselves in their capacity as officers of the court. Typically subpoenas are issued "in blank" and it is the responsibility of the lawyer representing the [[plaintiff]] or [[defendant]] on whose behalf the testimony is to be given to [[Service of process|serve]] the subpoena on the witness. If a witness is reluctant to testify, then the personal service of subpoena is usually required with proof of service by non-party server.

The subpoena will usually be on the letterhead of the court where the case is filed, name the parties to the case, and be addressed by name to the person whose testimony is being sought. It will contain the language "You are hereby commanded to report in person to the clerk of this court" or similar, describing the specific location, scheduled date and time of the appearance. Some issuing jurisdictions include an admonishment advising the subject of the criminal penalty for failure to comply with a subpoena, and reminding him or her not to leave the court facilities until excused by a competent authority. In some situations the person having to testify or produce documents is paid.

''[[Pro se]]'' litigants who represent themselves, unlike lawyers, must ask a court clerk to officially issue them subpoena forms when they need to call witnesses by phone or in person, or when they need to officially request documents to be sent to them and/or directly to court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/general/prose-litigants.htm|title=Pro Se Litigants / Representing Yourself}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any documents that have not been subpoenaed to court or verified by a witness may be dismissed by the opposite party as [[hearsay]], unless excepted by [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay rules]] or permitted by the judge. If the witness is called via long-distance phone call, then the requesting party is responsible for initiating the call and providing a payment with a prepaid phone card. Most states (including California) have further restrictions on subpoena use in criminal cases. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spolinlaw.com/blog/2016/10/05/los-angeles-criminal-court-subpoenas/|title=Los Angeles Criminal Court Subpoenas / Rules and Regulations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states (as is the case in Florida) require the subpoenaing party to first file a Notice of Intent to Serve Subpoena, or a Notice of Production from Non-Party ten days prior to issuing the subpoena, so that the other party may have ample time to file any objections.

Also, the party being subpoenaed has the right to object to the issuance of the subpoena, if it is for an improper purpose, such as subpoenaing records that have no relevance to the proceedings, or subpoenaing persons who would have no evidence to present, or subpoenaing records or testimony that is confidential or privileged.

=== Australia ===
In New South Wales, a court may set aside the whole, or part of, a subpoena on the basis that it is a "[[fishing expedition]]". In [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2015/303.html ''Lowery v Insurance Australia Ltd''], the NSW Court of Appeal held that where documents requested in the schedule of a subpoena are deemed to have no relevance to the proceedings in dispute, the subpoena may be set aside as it has no legitimate forensic purpose. It was also held that it was not the role of the Court to redraft the subpoena and narrow its scope to those issues in dispute. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2015/303.html Lowery v Insurance Australia Ltd [2015]] NSWCA 303&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sukkulenten-Sammlung Zürich''', literally [[succulent plant]] collection of the city of [[Zürich]], is a botanical garden in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Municipalities of the canton of Zürich|municipality]] of Zürich. It also houses a botanic library, a herbarium and the [[International Organizations for Succulent Plant Research]] (IOS).&lt;ref name="ios"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iosweb.org/|title=IOS|publisher=Grün Stadt Zürich|author=|language=|date=|accessdate=2015-01-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103014935/http://www.iosweb.org/|archivedate=2015-01-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gsz-sukkulentensammlung-ios"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/ted/de/index/gsz/natur-_und_erlebnisraeume/sukkulenten-sammlung/weltweite_vernetzung.html|title=Weltweite Vernetzung|publisher=Grün Stadt Zürich|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2015-01-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103014831/https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/ted/de/index/gsz/natur-_und_erlebnisraeume/sukkulenten-sammlung/weltweite_vernetzung.html|archivedate=2015-01-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The greenhouses are located in district of [[Enge (Zürich)|Enge]], on [[Zürichsee]] (Lake Zurich). They are a part of the [[Quaianlagen (Zürich)|Quaianlagen]] promenades, and are located on the southwestern lake shore. The collection is separated by the [[Mythenquai]] road from the lower lake shore promenade and the Enge harbour area, at the park facilities of the [[Strandbad Mythenquai|Mythenquai lido]] near the lower entrance to the [[Rieterpark]].

== History ==
At the end of the 1920s, Jakob Gasser, a cactus grower from Zürich, tried to sell his collection of about 1,500 succulents to the city government of Zürich, but the venture failed. in 1929, Julius Brann Gassersche, a store owner, acquired the unique collection and made a gift of it to the city of Zürich. The collection was housed in the greenhouses at the former site of the municipal gardens (''Stadtgärtnerei'') at Mythenquai, and established as ''Städtische Kakteensammlung'', meaning urban cactus collection.&lt;ref name="gsz-sukkulentensammlung"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/ted/de/index/gsz/natur-_und_erlebnisraeume/park-_und_gruenanlagen/arboretum.html|title=Sukkulentensammlung|publisher=Grün Stadt Zürich, [[Arboretum Zürich]]|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2015-01-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228185059/https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/ted/de/index/gsz/natur-_und_erlebnisraeume/park-_und_gruenanlagen/arboretum.html|archivedate=2014-12-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally established in 1931, the collection houses one of the largest and most important collections of succulent plants.&lt;ref name="gsz-sukkulentensammlung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gsz-75jahre"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/dam/stzh/ted/Deutsch/gsz/Natur-%20und%20Erlebnisraeume/Publikationen%20und%20Broschueren/Sukkulenten-Sammlung/Vom%20Buerkliplatz%20zur%20Sukkulenten-Sammlung1.pdf|title=Vom Bürkliplatz zur Sukkulenten-Sammlung|publisher=[[Grün Stadt Zürich]]|author=Grün Stadt Zürich|language=German|date=May 2006|accessdate=2015-01-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305075257/https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/dam/stzh/ted/Deutsch/gsz/Natur-%20und%20Erlebnisraeume/Publikationen%20und%20Broschueren/Sukkulenten-Sammlung/Vom%20Buerkliplatz%20zur%20Sukkulenten-Sammlung1.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main complex was built in 1947 and inaugurated in 1948. The succulent collection started in the existing greenhouse at Mythenquai, and was extended in 1948, 1954, 1961, 1984. In 2011, the entrance area was rebuilt and information for visitors improved. There are plans to redesign the Mythenquai area, including a renovation of the greenhouses.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Collection and structure ==
Succulents are plants from arid areas that survive by storing water, including [[Agave]]s, [[Aloe]]s and stonecrop family, in addition to [[Cactus|Cacti]] and thick leaf plants. The collection features more than 6,500 different types of succulent plants from more than 80 different plant families of ''[[Orchidaceae]]'', ''[[Crassulaceae]]'', ''[[Euphorbiaceae]]'', ''[[Aizoaceae]]'', ''[[Cactaceae]]'' and ''[[Apocynaceae]]''.&lt;ref name="gsz-sukkulentensammlung"/&gt; The collection is funded by [[Grün Stadt Zürich]] and by the booster association, ''Förderverein der Sukkulenten-Sammlung Zürich''.&lt;ref name="förderverein"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foerderverein.ch/|title=Förderverein der Sukkulenten-Sammlung Zürich|publisher=foerderverein.ch/|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2015-01-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102212143/http://www.foerderverein.ch/|archivedate=2015-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although internationally known for its scientific objectives, the Sukkulenten-Sammlung is perceived by the public as a collection. Periodic special displays provide an insight into the survival mechanisms used by succulents.&lt;ref name="gsz-75jahre"/&gt;

== Facilities ==
Surrounded by a park on the lake, the facilities house over 25,000 exotic plants in about 6,500 species and varieties on {{convert|4750|sqm|acre|2}}, including {{convert|700|sqm|acre|2}} in six greenhouses, 16 heated cold frame boxes and an outdoor area. The staff consists of nine employees who take care of to 50,000 visitors annually. The greenhouses are open daily.&lt;ref name="gsz-sukkulentensammlung"/&gt;

== IOS library, database and herbarium ==
Since about 1947, the institution has been involved in an international seed exchange between botanical institutes and gardens around the world. Currently, there are more than 200 botanical gardens involved. In addition, Sukkulenten-Sammlung houses a specialized library on succulent plants. These books are not allowed to leave the library, but can be seen when the collection is open. The library contains more than 30,187 titles.&lt;ref name="gsz-sukkulentensammlung-ios"/&gt;

The [[herbarium]] was founded in 1950,&lt;ref name="gsz-sukkulentensammlung-ios"/&gt; simultaneously with the [[International Organizations for Succulent Plant Research]] (IOS),&lt;ref name="ios"/&gt; and has an extensive archive of plants with approximately 20,000 specimens and a meticulous tracking database. It is now under the patronage of the Swiss [[UNESCO]] commission.&lt;ref name="gsz-75jahre"/&gt;

== Förderverein association ==
Despite the uniqueness of the collection, in 1996 the municipal council (''Gemeinderat'') of the city of Zürich sought to either outsource the collection of succulents or to close the collection entirely.&lt;ref name="gsz-75jahre"/&gt; This political pressure led to the founding of the boosting association ''Förderverein der Sukkulenten-Sammlung Zürich''.&lt;ref name="förderverein"/&gt; The council then decided to suspend the motion, until it became clear whether the [[Canton of Zürich]] and the federal authorities would become involved in co-financing.&lt;ref name="gsz-75jahre"/&gt;

== Cultural heritage of national importance ==
Sukkulenten-Sammlung Zürich is listed in the [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance]] as a ''Class A'' object of national importance.&lt;ref name="kgs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar/a-objekte.parsys.000108.DownloadFile.tmp/zh2015.pdf|title=A-Objekte KGS-Inventar|publisher=Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, Amt für Bevölkerungsschutz|author=|language=|date=2015-01-01|accessdate=2015-09-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001193946/http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar/a-objekte.parsys.000108.DownloadFile.tmp/zh2015.pdf|archivedate=2015-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preceding works===
''The Jepson Manual'' is considered a revision of the first major California flora publication, the ''Manual of the Flowering Plants of California'' by [[Willis Linn Jepson]]. It was  originally published in 1925. 

''The Jepson Manual'' also follows [[Philip A. Munz]] and [[David D. Keck]] in their ''A California Flora and Supplement'' of 1958 and 1968.&lt;ref&gt;"''The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California''" by James C. Hickman, Rudolf Schmid, ''Taxon'', Vol. 42, No. 2 (May, 1993), pp. 508-510&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other florae, ''The Jepson Manual'' builds upon these prior publications. Except for the number of line drawings, it has more in common with Munz's 1968 book than with Jepson's 1923 book. &lt;!---visual comparison---{{Fact|date=June 2008}}--?--&gt; 

===Editions===
The first edition of ''The Jepson Manual'' was published in 1993 as '''''The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California''''' (TJM93), and was edited by James C. Hickman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/jepman.html Ucjeps.berkeley.edu: The Jepson Manual]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second edition was published in 2012, as ''The Jepson Manual: Vascular Plants of California, Thoroughly Revised and Expanded'' (TJM2), and was edited by [[Bruce G. Baldwin]], Douglas Goldman, David J Keil, Robert Patterson, and Thomas J. Rosatti. The second edition features 7,601 California plant species, subspecies and varieties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2012/01/30/california-native-plant-classic-jepson-manual-revision/ UC Berkeley News Center: "California native-plant classic gets a 21st-century makeover"], by Cathy Cockrell&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/new_era.html  Ucjeps.berkeley.edu: Second Edition of The Jepson Manual update]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the book is named in honor of Jepson, ''The Jepson Manual'' is not simply a new edition of Jepson's 1923 book, but a new work which Baldwin calls "“the most time-consuming undertaking of my career."&lt;ref&gt;"California native-plant classic gets a 21st-century makeover"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tongzhi''''' ("Comprehensive Records") is a 1161 Chinese [[general knowledge]] encyclopedia written by Zheng Qiao (鄭樵) in the [[Song dynasty]], containing 200 chapters on diverse topics.

==Contents==
After the ''[[Tongdian]]'', it was the second encyclopedia of the ''Santong'' (The Three Encyclopedias), which were often published together. It is also included second among the ''Shitong'' (The Ten Encyclopedias), compiled in the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Endymion Porter. ''Chinese History: A Manual''. Harvard University Asia Center, 1998. Page 524.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tongzhi'' became a model for most of the later encyclopedias.

''Tongzhi'' is arranged in 200 volumes (''juan''), plus three volumes of notes. The historical information covers from earliest times to the end of the [[Tang dynasty]]. The contents include basic annals, yearly chronicles, hereditary houses, ranked biographies, and twenty monographs (''lüe'' 略) on various topics, the last of which are considered the most original part.&lt;ref name="E526"&gt;Endymion, 526.&lt;/ref&gt; The twenty monographs, which comprise 52 volumes, deal with clans, the [[Chinese character classification|six classes of characters]], phonetics, astronomy, geography, capital cities, rituals, posthumous names, vessels and robes, music, official titles, the examination system, punishment, food and money, arts and literature, collation, images, metal and stone, disasters and fortunes, insects and plants. The comprehensivity of these monographs has long been noted; the ''[[Siku Quanshu Zongmu Tiyao]]'' (completed in 1798) praised them in particular.

The chapter on images (''Tu pu lüe'' 图谱略) has attracted considerable interest among art theorists. In this section, he gives images primacy in transmitting values, using metaphor that compares the images as the warp (''jing'' 經) and the text as the weft (''wei'' 緯).&lt;ref&gt;Han Si. ''A Chinese Word on Image: Zheng Qiao (1104-1162) and His Thought on Images''. Acta Universitatis Gothoburgensis, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chapter on arts and literature (''Yi wen lüe'' 藝文略) has the most detailed bibliographic scheme in pre-modern China.&lt;ref name="E526"/&gt;
