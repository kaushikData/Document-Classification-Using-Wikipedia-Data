'''Andreas Angelus''' (German name ''Andreas Engel'', 16 November 1561 &amp;ndash; 9 August 1598) was a German clergyman, teacher and government inspector, known for his chronicles of the history of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].

== Biography ==
Engel was born in [[Strausberg]], Germany, the son of Gregorius Engel, a member of the town council. At the early age of 12 he was admitted to the Alma Mater Viadrina, the university of [[Frankfurt an der Oder]] (now the [[Viadrina European University]]). His family died in 1575 of the plague, after which he left Brandenburg; he is recorded in 1577 as a pupil of the [[:de:Marienstiftsgymnasium|Marienstiftsgymnasium]] in [[Stettin]]. Later he lived for some time in [[Holstein]] where he wrote a chronicle of Holstein. From about 1580 he can be traced once again in Brandenburg, in various educational posts: conrector and cantor in Strausberg from 1582; rector in Strausberg 1584-1586; conrector in the ''Neustadt'' of [[Brandenburg an der Havel]] 1586-87; also as a teacher in the Franciscans' school in Berlin (now the [[Berlinisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster]]).

On 14 September 1592 he married Sabina, eldest daughter of Jacob Colerus, [[Provost (religion)|provost]] of the [[St. Nicholas' Church, Berlin|church of St. Nicholas in Berlin]], and in the same year was made pastor (and inspector) in his birthplace Strausberg.

From this time he started to write his three works on the history of the Mark Brandenburg, which, although they had Latin titles, were written entirely in German. 
His principal work was a comprehensive history under the working title ''Marchia''. In about 1593 the first published volume drawn from this work appeared under the title ''Rerum Marchicarum Breviarum'', and two years later a further volume entitled ''Annales Marchiae Brandenburgicae''. Angelus cites some 200 printed works and a further twenty or so, which at that time were available only in manuscript. 

He planned a third volume to complete the published history, but he died of the plague on 9 August 1598 and the unfinished manuscript of the third part was burnt by his widow after his death, apparently because of some sort of financial dispute.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art critics]] usually criticise art in the context of [[aesthetics]] or the theory of beauty.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; A goal of art criticism is the pursuit of a rational basis for art appreciation&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; but it is questionable whether such criticism can transcend prevailing socio-political circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Marty.  [http://www.jewishjournal.com/marty_kaplan/article/the_curious_case_of_criticism "The curious case of criticism."] ''Jewish Journal''.  23 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of [[Art movement|artistic movements]] has resulted in a division of art criticism into different disciplines which may each use different criteria for their judgements.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt; The most common division in the field of criticism is between historical criticism and evaluation, a form of art history, and contemporary criticism of work by living artists.&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;

Despite perceptions that art criticism is a much lower risk activity than making art, opinions of current art are always liable to drastic corrections with the passage of time.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt; Critics of the past are often ridiculed for either favouring artists now derided (like the [[Academic art|academic painters]] of the late 19th century){{citation needed|date=December 2012}} or dismissing artists now venerated (like the early work of the [[Impressionists]]).&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rewald1973" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ackerman|first=James S.|title=Art History and the Problems of Criticism|journal=Daedalus|date=Winter 1960|volume=89|issue=1 – The Visual Arts Today|pages=253–263|jstor=20026565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some art movements themselves were named disparagingly by critics, with the name later adopted as a sort of badge of honour by the artists of the style (e.g., [[Impressionism]], [[Cubism]]), with the original negative meaning forgotten.&lt;ref name="rewald1973"&gt;Rewald, John (1973).

Artists have often had an uneasy relationship with their critics. Artists usually need positive opinions from critics for their work to be viewed and purchased; unfortunately for the artists, only later generations may understand it.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seenan|first=Gerard|title=Painting by ridiculed but popular artist sells for £744,800|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/20/arts.artsnews1|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art is an important part of being human and can be found through all aspects of our lives, regardless of the culture or times. There are many different variables that determine one's judgment of art such as aesthetics, cognition or perception. Art can be objective or subjective based on personal preference toward aesthetics and form. It can be based on the elements and principle of design and by social and cultural acceptance. Art is a basic human instinct with a diverse range of form and expression. Art can stand-alone with an instantaneous judgment or can be viewed with a deeper more educated knowledge. Aesthetic, pragmatic, expressive, formalist, relativist, processional, imitation, ritual, cognition, mimetic and postmodern theories are some of many theories to criticize and appreciate art. Art criticism and appreciation can be subjective based on personal preference toward aesthetics and form, or it can be based on the elements and principle of design and by social and cultural acceptance.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Definition==
Art criticism has many and often numerous subjective viewpoints which are nearly as varied as there are people practising it.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; It is difficult to come by a more stable definition than the activity being related to the discussion and interpretation of art and its value.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Depending on who is writing on the subject, "art criticism" itself may be obviated as a direct goal or it may include [[art history]] within its framework.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Regardless of definitional problems, art criticism can refer to the [[history of art|history of the craft]] in its essays and art history itself may use critical methods implicitly.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt; According to art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]], "The borders between art history and art criticism... are no more as firmly drawn as they once used to be. It perhaps began with art historians taking interest in modern art."&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Art criticism includes a descriptive aspect,&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; where the work of art is sufficiently translated into words so as to allow a case to be made.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evaluation of a work of art that follows the description (or is interspersed with it) depends as much on the artist's output as on the experience of the critic.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p6" /&gt; There is in an activity with such a marked subjective component a variety of ways in which it can be pursued.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt; As extremes in a possible spectrum,&lt;ref name="fishman1963p5" /&gt; while some favour simply remarking on the immediate impressions caused by an artistic object,&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; others prefer a more systematic approach calling on technical knowledge, favoured [[aesthetic theory]] and the known sociocultural context the artist is immersed in to discern their intent.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of art criticism}}
Critiques of art likely originated with the origins of art itself, as evidenced by texts found in the works of [[Plato]], [[Vitruvius]] or [[Augustine of Hippo]] among others, that contain early forms of art criticism.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Also, wealthy [[patron]]s have employed, at least since the start of [[Renaissance]], intermediary art-evaluators to assist them in the procurement of commissions and/or finished pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Creighton E.|title=What Did the Renaissance Patron Buy?|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Summer 1998|volume=51|issue=2|pages=392–450|url=http://classroom.kleinisd.net/users/1243/docs/what_did_the_renaissance_patron_buy.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press on behalf of the Renaissance Society of America|doi=10.2307/2901572|jstor=2901572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagel|first=Alexander|title=Negotiating the Gift: Pre-Modern Figurations of Exchange|year=2003|pages=319–360|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/people/faculty/nagel_PDFs/Art_as_Gift_lq.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2013|chapter=Art as Gift: Liberal Art and Religious Reform in the Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
[[File:Jonathan Richardson by Jonathan Richardson.jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]] coined the term 'art criticism' in 1719.]]
Art criticism as a genre of writing, obtained its modern form in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; The earliest use of the term art criticism was by the English painter [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]] in his 1719 publication ''An Essay on the Whole Art of Criticism''. In this work, he attempted to create an objective system for the ranking of works of art. Seven categories, including drawing, composition, invention and colouring, were given a score from 0 to 18, which were combined to give a final score. The term he introduced quickly caught on, especially as the English middle class began to be more discerning in their art acquisitions, as symbols of their flaunted social status.&lt;ref name="pearson"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205900771.pdf|title=A History of Art Criticism|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France and England in the mid 1700s, public interest in art began to become widespread, and art was regularly exhibited at the Salons in Paris and the [[Summer Exhibition]]s of London. The first writers to acquire an individual reputation as art critics in 18th-century France were [[Jean-Baptiste Dubos]] with his ''Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture'' (1718)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubos|first=Jean-Baptiste|title=Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture|year=1732|publisher=E. Neaulme|location=Utrecht|url=https://archive.org/details/reflexionscriti03jeagoog|edition=3rd|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; which garnered the acclaim of [[Voltaire]] for the sagacity of his approach to aesthetic theory;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Voltaire|authorlink=Voltaire |title=Le Siècle de Louis XIV|year=1874|publisher=Charpentier et C&lt;sup&gt;ie&lt;/sup&gt;, Libraires-Éditeurs|location=Paris|page=581|url=https://archive.org/details/sicledelouisxiv00voltgoog|editor=Charles Louandre|accessdate=10 December 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Étienne La Font de Saint-Yenne]] with ''Reflexions sur quelques causes de l'état présent de la peinture en France'' who wrote about the Salon of 1746,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=La Font de Saint-Yenne|first=Étienne|title=Reflexions sur quelques causes de l'état présent de la peinture en France : avec un examen des principaux ouvrages exposés au Louvre le mois d'août 1746|year=1747|publisher=Jean Neaulme|location=The Hague|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; commenting on the socioeconomic framework of the production of the then popular [[Baroque]] art style,&lt;ref name="saisselin1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saisselin|first=Rémy G.|title=The Enlightenment Against the Baroque: Economics and Aesthetics in the Eighteenth Century|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=49–50|url=http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft0779n6fb/|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a perception of anti-monarchist sentiments in the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Walter |first=Nancy Paige Ryan |title=From Armida to Cornelia: Women and Representation in Prerevolutionary France |type=MA |page=11 |url=http://repositories.tdl.org/ttu-ir/handle/2346/15694 |year=1995 |publisher=Texas Tech University |accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th-century French writer [[Denis Diderot]] greatly advanced the medium of art criticism. Diderot's "The Salon of 1765"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diderot|first=Denis|title=Essais sur la peinture|year=1795|publisher=François Buisson|location=Paris|pages=118–407|url=https://archive.org/details/gri_000033125010886956|editor=François Buisson|accessdate=10 December 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first real attempts to capture art in words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Morley|first=John|authorlink=John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn|editor=Hugh Chisholm, Franklin Henry Hooper|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=DIDEROT, DENIS|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:EB1911_-_Volume_08.djvu/222|accessdate=10 December 2012|edition=11th|year=1911|volume=8|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian [[Thomas E. Crow]], "When Diderot took up art criticism it was on the heels of the first generation of professional writers who made it their business to offer descriptions and judgments of contemporary painting and sculpture. The demand for such commentary was a product of the similarly novel institution of regular, free, public exhibitions of the latest art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=Thomas E.|title=Diderot on Art, Volume I: The Salon of 1765 and Notes on Painting|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|page=x|editor=Denis Diderot|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in England an exhibition of the [[Society of Arts]] in 1762 and later, in 1766, prompted a flurry of critical, though anonymous, pamphlets. Newspapers and periodicals of the period, such as the ''[[London Chronicle]]'', began to carry columns for art criticism; a form that took off with the foundation of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1768.
In the 1770s, the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'' became the first newspaper to systematically review the art featured at exhibitions.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:John Ruskin - Project Gutenberg eText 13103.jpg|thumb|[[John Ruskin]], the preeminent art critic of 19th century England.]]
From the 19th century onwards, art criticism became a more common vocation and even a profession,&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; developing at times formalised methods based on particular [[aesthetic theory|aesthetic theories]].&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, a rift emerged in the 1820s between the proponents of traditional [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] forms of art and the new [[romanticism|romantic]] fashion. The Neoclassicists, under [[Étienne-Jean Delécluze]] defended the classical ideal and preferred carefully finished form in paintings. Romantics, such as [[Stendhal]], criticized the old styles as overly formulaic and devoid of any feeling. Instead, they championed the new expressive, Idealistic, and emotional nuances of Romantic art. A similar, though more muted, debate also occurred in England.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

One of the prominent critics in England at the time was [[William Hazlitt]], a painter and essayist. He wrote about his deep pleasure in art and his belief that the arts could be used to improve mankind's generosity of spirit and knowledge of the world around it. He was one of a rising tide of English critics that began to grow uneasy with the increasingly abstract direction [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s landscape art was moving in.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

One of the great critics of the 19th century was [[John Ruskin]]. In 1843 he published ''[[Modern Painters]]'' in which he robustly defended the work of [[J. M. W. Turner]] from his critics, who charged Turner with being unfaithful to nature. Through painstaking analysis and attention to detail, Ruskin was able to demonstrate the very opposite, in what the art historian [[E. H. Gombrich]] called "the most ambitious work of scientific art criticism ever attempted." Ruskin became renowned for his rich and flowing prose, and later in life he branched out to become an active and wide-ranging critic, publishing works on architecture and [[Renaissance art]], including the ''[[Stones of Venice]]''.

[[File:Étienne Carjat, Portrait of Charles Baudelaire, circa 1862.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''Salon of 1845'' art review shocked its audience with its ideas.]]
Another dominating figure in 19th-century art criticism, was the French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]], whose first published work was his art review ''Salon of 1845'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudelaire|first=Charles|title=Curiosités esthétiques: Salon 1845–1859|year=1868|publisher=M. Lévy|pages=5–76|url=https://archive.org/details/curiositsesthti00baudgoog|accessdate=10 December 2013|chapter=Salon de 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt; which attracted immediate attention for its boldness.&lt;ref name="eb1911bau"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

He tried to move the debate from the old binary positions of previous decades, declaring that "the true painter, will be he who can wring from contemporary life its epic aspect and make us see and understand, with colour or in drawing, how great and poetic we are in our cravats and our polished boots".&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

In 1877, [[John Ruskin]] derided ''Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket'' after the artist, [[James McNeill Whistler]], showed it at [[Grosvenor Gallery]]:&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, Linda, ''After Whistler: The Artist and His Influence on American Painting.'' City: Publisher, 2003. p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; "I have seen, and heard, much of Cockney impudence before now; but never expected to hear a [[Wiktionary:coxcomb|coxcomb]] ask two hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Anderson and Anne Koval, ''James McNeill Whistler: Beyond the Myth'', Carroll &amp; Graf, New York, 1994, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism provoked Whistler into suing the critic for libel.&lt;ref&gt;Stuttaford, Genevieve.

===Turn of the twentieth century===
[[File:Roger Fry self-portrait.jpg|thumb|Self portrait of [[Roger Fry]], described by the [[art historian]] [[Kenneth Clark]] as "incomparably the greatest influence on taste since [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]... In so far as taste can be changed by one man, it was changed by Roger Fry".&lt;ref&gt;IAN CHILVERS. "Fry, Roger." The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists. 2003. Encyclopedia.com. 9 March 2009 &lt;http://www.encyclopedia.com&gt;.Retrieved 9 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Towards the end of the 19th century a movement towards abstraction, as opposed to specific content, began to gain ground in England, notably championed by the playwright [[Oscar Wilde]]. By the early twentieth century these attitudes formally coalesced into a coherent philosophy, through the work of [[Bloomsbury Group]] members [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, as art critic &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_artcritic.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Group Profiles &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/group.htm#bellc|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an art historian in the 1890s, Fry became intrigued with the new modernist art and its shift away from traditional depiction. His 1910 exhibition of what he called [[post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] art attracted much criticism for its iconoclasm. He vigorously defended himself in a lecture, in which he argued that art had moved to attempt to discover the language of pure imagination, rather than the staid and, to his mind, dishonest scientific capturing of landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, ideas &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_ideas.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, modern art &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_modernart.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry's argument proved to be very influential at the time, especially among the progressive elite. [[Virginia Woolf]] remarked that: "in or about December 1910 [the date Fry gave his lecture] human character changed."&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

Independently, and at the same time, [[Clive Bell]] argued in his 1914 book ''Art'' that all art work has its particular 'significant form', while the conventional subject matter was essentially irrelevant. This work laid the foundations for the [[formalism (art)|formalist]] approach to art.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tekiner|first=Deniz|title=Formalist Art Criticism and the Politics of Meaning|journal=Social Justice|year=2006|volume=33|issue=2 (104) – Art, Power, and Social Change|pages=31–44|jstor=29768369}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Fry argued that "it’s all the same to me if I represent a Christ or a [[saucepan]] since it's the form, and not the object itself, that interests me." As well as being a proponent of [[formalism (art)|formalism]], he argued that the value of art lies in its ability to produce a distinctive aesthetic experience in the viewer. an experience he called "aesthetic emotion". He defined it as that experience which is aroused by significant form. He also suggested that the reason we experience aesthetic emotion in response to the significant form of a work of art was that we perceive that form as an expression of an experience the artist has. The artist's experience in turn, he suggested, was the experience of seeing ordinary objects in the world as pure form: the experience one has when one sees something not as a means to something else, but as an end in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4XeRgAACAAJ|title=Art|author=Clive Bell|year=2010|publisher=General Books LLC|isbn=9781770451858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Read]] was a champion of modern British artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[Ben Nicholson]], [[Henry Moore]] and [[Barbara Hepworth]] and became associated with Nash's contemporary arts group Unit One. He focused on the [[modernism]] of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]], and published an influential 1929 essay on the meaning of art in ''The Listener''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Paul Nash (1889–1946)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/paul-nash|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Ben Nicholson (1894–1982)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/ben-nicholson|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Henry Moore (1898–1986)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/henry-moore|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Barbara Hepworth (1903–1975)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/barbara-hepworth|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also edited the trend-setting ''Burlington Magazine'' (1933–38) and helped organise the [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205900771.pdf|title=A History of Art Criticism|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1945===
As in the case of Baudelaire in the 19th century, the poet-as-critic phenomenon appeared once again in the 20th, when French poet [[Apollinaire]] became the champion of Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=Katharine |title=The Cubist Painters by Guillaume Apollinaire; Peter Read|journal=French Forum|date=Spring 2005|volume=30|issue=2|pages=139–141|jstor=40552391|doi=10.1353/frf.2005.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathews|first=Timothy|title=Apollinaire and Cubism?|journal=Style|date=Summer 1988|volume=22|issue=2|pages=275–298|url=http://mlpa.nottingham.ac.uk/archive/00000033/01/Rec_Mathews.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, French writer and hero of the Resistance [[André Malraux]] wrote extensively on art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Derek|title=Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art|year=2009|publisher=Rodopi}}&lt;/ref&gt; going well beyond the limits of his native Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hudek|first=Antony|title=The Vocal Turn|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|year=2012|volume=10|issue=1|pages=64–65|doi=10.5334/jcms.1011210}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conviction that the vanguard in Latin America lay in [[Mexican Muralism]] ([[José Clemente Orozco|Orozco]], [[Diego Rivera|Rivera]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros|Siqueiros]]){{citation needed|date=December 2012}} changed after his trip to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1958. After visiting the studios of several Argentine artists in the company of the young Director of the Museum of Modern Art of Buenos Aires [[Rafael Squirru]], Malraux declared the new vanguard to lie in [[Argentina]]'s new artistic movements.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Squirru, a poet-critic who became Cultural Director of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] in [[Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C.|Washington, D.C.]], during the 1960s, was the last to interview [[Edward Hopper]] before his death, contributing to a revival of interest in the American artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Gail|title=Edward Hopper : an intimate biography|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s there were not only few galleries ([[The Art of This Century]]) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the [[New York Vanguard]].&lt;ref name="artofthiscentury"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=The Art Story: Gallery – The Art of This Century Gallery|url=http://www.theartstory.org/gallery-art-of-this-century.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also a few artists with a literary background, among them [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Barnett Newman]] who functioned as critics as well.&lt;ref name="aaa.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-robert-motherwell-13286 |title=Oral history interview with Robert Motherwell, 1971 Nov. 24-1974 May 1 – Oral Histories &amp;#124; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Motherwell|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/robert-motherwell-1673|publisher=Tate|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;[http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php The Barnett Newman Foundation website: Chronology of the Artist's Life page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although New York and the world were unfamiliar with the New York [[avant-garde]],&lt;ref name="artofthiscentury" /&gt; by the late 1940s most of the artists who have become household names today had their well established patron critics.&lt;ref name="oxfordart"&gt;{{cite web|title=Painters in Postwar New York City|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/public/page/benz/themes/PostwarNYC|work=Oxford Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement Greenberg]] advocated [[Jackson Pollock]] and the [[color field]] painters like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], Barnett Newman, [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Hans Hofmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Abstract Expressionism|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-abstract-expressionism.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uima.uiowa.edu/mural/ Jackson Pollock, ''Mural'' (1943)] [[University of Iowa Museum of Art]], Iowa City.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greenberg55"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Clement|title=American-Type Painting|journal=[[Partisan Review]]|year=1955|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webexhibits"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Abstract Expressionism: Painting Action and Colorfields|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/colorart/abstract-expressionism.html|work=Color Vision &amp; Art|publisher=webexhibits.org|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology|url=http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php|publisher=The Barnett Newman Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Exhibitions – Adolph Gottlieb|url=http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/home/content/exhibitions/special/gottlieb/gottlieb.html|publisher=The Jewish Museum|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Hofmann: Biography|url=http://www.hanshofmann.org/biography|publisher=The Estate of Hans Hofmann|accessdate=12 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129075738/http://www.hanshofmann.org/biography|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Rosenberg]] seemed to prefer the action painters such as [[Willem de&amp;nbsp;Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Mark|author2=Annalyn Swan|title=When de Kooning Was King|journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=8 November 2004|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/culture/features/10248/index1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Harold Rosenberg|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-rosenberg-harold.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas B. Hess]], the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Thomas B. Hess|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-hess-thomas.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new critics elevated their protégés by casting other artists as "followers" or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Hess, "Willem de Kooning", George Braziller, Inc. New York, 1959 p.:13&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, in 1958, [[Mark Tobey]] "became the first American painter since Whistler (1895) to win top prize at the Biennale of Venice. New York's two leading art magazines were not interested. ''Arts'' mentioned the historic event only in a news column and ''Art News'' (Managing editor: Thomas B. Hess) ignored it completely. ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' printed feature articles".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/5750568&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]] wrote catalogue forewords and reviews and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Session at Studio 35: "We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image".&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pgs.: 240–241, University of California Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter to [[Sidney Janis]] on 9 April 1955: {{quotation|It is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, p.: 201, University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York [[Trotskyist]], [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxfordart"/&gt; As long time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt; Artist [[Robert Motherwell]], well-heeled, joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glueck|first=Grace|title=Robert Motherwell, Master of Abstract, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/18/obituaries/robert-motherwell-master-of-abstract-dies.html|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 July 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement Greenberg proclaimed [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[Jackson Pollock]] in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. Greenberg supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[Cézanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever "purer" and more concentrated in what was "essential" to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, ''Art and Culture Critical essays,'' ("The Crisis of the Easel Picture"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.:154–157&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which "what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event". "The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New,'' Chapter 2, "The American Action Painter", Da Capo Press, 1959 pp.:23–39&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most vocal critics of Abstract Expressionism at the time was ''New York Times'' art critic [[John Canaday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=John Canaday|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-canaday-john.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] were also important postwar art historians who voiced support for Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|title=A Critic Turns 90; Meyer Schapiro|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/magazine/a-critic-turns-90-meyer-schapiro.html|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGuire|first=Kristi|title=Remembering Leo Steinberg (1920–2011)|url=http://pressblog.uchicago.edu/2011/03/15/remembering-leo-steinberg-1920-2011.html|work=The Chicago Blog|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early to mid sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]] and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Michael Fried|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-fried-michael.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Rosalind Krauss|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-krauss-rosalind.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Robert Hughes|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-hughes-robert.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist art criticism===
[[Feminist art criticism]] emerged in the 1970s from the wider [[feminist movement]] as the critical examination of both visual representations of women in art and art [[women artists|produced by women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deepwell|first=Katie|title=12 Step Guide to Feminist Art, Art History and Criticism|journal=N.paradoxa|date=September 2012|volume=online|issue=21|page=8|url=http://www.ktpress.co.uk/pdf/nparadoxaissue21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a major field of art criticism.

==Today==

Art critics today work not only in print media and in specialist art magazines as well as newspapers. Art critics appear also on the internet, TV, and radio, as well as in museums and galleries.&lt;ref name="ntifotva"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Criticism|url=http://art.unt.edu/ntieva/pages/teaching/tea_comp_artcriticism.html|work=Comprehensive Art Education|publisher=North Texas Institute For Educators on the Visual Arts|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gratza|first=Agnieszka|title=Frieze or faculty?

Art critics curate exhibitions and are frequently employed to write exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt; Art critics have their own organisation, a [[UNESCO]] non-governmental organisation, called the [[International Association of Art Critics]] which has around 76 national sections and a political non-aligned section for refugees and exiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Association of Art Critics|url=http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100031328|work=UNESCO NGO – db|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art blogs===
{{Main|Art blog}}

Since the early 21st century, online art critical websites and art blogs have cropped up around the world to add their voices to the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Tyler|title=Tyler Green|url=http://www.nyfa.org/level3.asp?id=283&amp;fid=6&amp;sid=17|work=In Their Own Words|publisher=New York Foundation for the Arts|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaiser|first=Michael|title=The Death of Criticism or Everyone Is a Critic|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-kaiser/the-death-of-criticism-or_b_1092125.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these writers use [[social media]] resources like Facebook, Twitter, [[Tumblr]] and [[Google+]] to introduce readers to their opinions about art criticism.

'''Atomic Age''' in [[design]] refers to the period roughly corresponding to 1940–1960, when concerns about [[nuclear war]] dominated [[Western culture|Western society]] during the [[Cold War]]. Architecture, industrial design, commercial design (including advertising), interior design, and fine arts were all influenced by the themes of atomic science, as well as the [[Space Age]], which coincided with that period. Atomic Age design became popular and instantly recognizable, with a use of atomic motifs and space age symbols. [[Retrofuturism]] is a current resurgence of interest in Atomic Age design.

==Vital forms==
"Vital forms", or abstract organic forms, were identified as a core motif in the 2001 exhibition of Atomic Age design at the [[Brooklyn Museum of Art]], titled "Vital forms: American art and design in the atomic age, 1940–1960".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rapaport, Brooke Kamin and Kevin Stayton|title=Vital Forms: American Art and Design in the Atomic Age, 1940–1960|year=2001|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art in association with Harry N. Abrams, 2001|isbn=978-0-87273-145-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atomic power was a paradox during the era. It held great promise of technological solutions for the problems facing an increasingly complex world; at the same time, people were fearful of a nuclear armageddon, after the use of the atomic bomb at the end of World War II. People were ever-aware of the potential good, and lurking menace, in technology. Science became more visible in the mainstream culture through Atomic Age design.

Atomic particles themselves were reproduced in visual design, in areas ranging from architecture to [[barkcloth]] patterns. The geometric atomic patterns that were produced in textiles, industrial materials, [[melamine]] counter tops, dishware and wallpaper, and many other items, are emblematic of Atomic Age design. The Space Age interests of the public also began showing up in Atomic Age designs, with star and galaxy motifs appearing with the atomic graphics.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Free-form organic shapes also appear as a recurring theme in Atomic Age design. British designers at the [[Council of Industrial Design]] (CoID) produced fabrics in the early 1950s that showed "skeletal plant forms, drawn in a delicate, spidery graphic form", reflecting x-ray technology that was becoming more widespread and familiar in pop culture. These botanic designs influenced later Atomic Age patterns that included repeating organic shapes similar to cells and organisms viewed through a microscope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Leslie|title=Twentieth Century Pattern Design|year=2007|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=978-1-56898-712-5|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are similarities between many Atomic Age designs and the [[mid-century modern]] trend of the same time. Elements of Atomic Age and Space Age design were dominant in the [[Googie]] design movement in commercial buildings in the United States. Some streamlined industrial designs also echoed the influence of [[futurism]] that had been seen much earlier in [[Art Deco]] design.

==Space Age design==
Whereas Atomic Age motifs and structures leaned towards design fields such as architecture and industrial design, Space Age design spread into a broader range of consumer products, including clothing fashion, and even animation styles, as with the popular television show ''[[The Jetsons]]''. Beginning with the dawn of the Space Age (commonly attributed to the launch of [[Sputnik]] in October, 1957&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickson|first=Paul|title=A Dictionary of the Space Age|year=2009|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-9115-1|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Space Age design captured the optimism and faith in technology that was felt by much of society during the 1950s and 1960s. Space Age design also had a more [[vernacular]] character, appearing in accessible forms that quickly became familiar to mainstream consumers. Space Age design became more closely associated with [[kitsch]] and with [[Googie]] architecture for popular commercial buildings such as diners, bowling alleys, and shops. "Space Age design is closely tied to the pop movement [...] the fusion of popular culture, art, design, and fashion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elder|first=Alan|title=Made in Canada: Craft and Design in the Sixties|year=2005|publisher=McGill-Queen's|isbn=978-0-7735-2873-4|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fashion===

Two of the most well-known fashion designers to use Space Age themes in their designs were [[Pierre Cardin]] and [[Paco Rabanne]]. Pierre Cardin established the futuristic trend of using synthetic and industrial materials in fashion, with "forward thinking" innovations in his early 1960s work. Cardin "popularized the use of everyday materials for fashion items, like vinyl and metal rings for dresses, carpentry nails for [[brooch]]es, and common decorative effects such as geometric cut-outs, [[appliqué]]s, large pockets, helmets and oversized buttons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stecker|first=Pamela|title=The Fashion Design Manual|year=1996|publisher=Macmillan Educational AU|isbn=978-0-7329-0716-7|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Cardin launched his "space age" line, and [[André Courrèges]] showed his "Moon Girl" collection, introducing the white [[go-go boot]] style and other icons of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fashion Reader: Second Edition|year=2011|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84788-590-6|pages=100|editor=Linda Welters, Abby Lillethu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese designer, [[Issey Miyake]] from Hiroshima, worked in Paris and New York from 1964 to 1970, and used many atomic age forms, and technologically produced materials in his work. In 1970 he moved to Tokyo to continue these innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=English|first1=Bonnie|title=Japanese Fashion Designers: The Work and Influence of Issey Miyaki, Yohji Yamamoto, and Rei Kawakubo|date=2013|publisher=Berg|isbn=9780857850546|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xRc4AAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=issey+miyake+monograph&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miyake cites his first encounter with design as two bridges his home-town, [[Hiroshima]] at the hypocenter of the atomic bombing of the city in WWII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miyake|first1=Issey|title=The Concepts and Work of Issey Miyake|url=http://mds.isseymiyake.com/im/en/work/|website=Issey Miyake {{!}} 三宅一生|publisher=The Miyake Issey Foundation|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vernacular architecture===
[[File:Dingbat samoPerdy.jpg|thumb|Example of "dingbat" apartment facade.]]
The dingbat apartment house, ubiquitous in the Los Angeles, California area were built between 1945 through the 1960s, fused a purist style with googie influence. The architect, Francis Ventre, coined the term "dingbat" for these quickly built stucco and frame simple structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piercy|first1=Clive|title=Pretty Vacant: The Los Angeles Dingbat Observed|date=2003|publisher=Chronicle Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-8118-4024-7|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Pretty_Vacant.html?id=lZ6vvMKtFV4C|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These structures often had a single exterior ornament in the shape of a starburst, boomerang, or pattern of rectangles.

The [[Chemosphere]] house, designed by [[John Lautner]] in 1960, has become an icon of the atomic age home. The octagonal shaped house is cantilevered on a steep slope in the Hollywood Hills, California. At the time, [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] cited it as the "most modern home built in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Timberg|first1=Scott|title=Landmark Houses: John Lautner's Chemosphere|url=http://www.latimes.com/home/la-hm-landmark-houses-john-lautner-chemosphere-htmlstory.html|accessdate=7 December 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4827">The '''criterion of dissimilarity''' (also called '''criterion of discontinuity''')&lt;ref&gt;''Who Is Jesus?'' by Thomas P. Rausch (Jul 1, 2003) {{ISBN|0814650783}} page 36&lt;/ref&gt; is used in [[Biblical criticism]] to determine if a statement attributed to Jesus may be authentic. It is often used as a shorthand for the '''criterion of double dissimilarity'''.&lt;ref name=Gregg29 &gt;''The Historical Jesus and the Final Judgment Sayings in Q'' (Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen Zum Neuen Testament) by Brian Han Gregg (Jun 30, 2006) {{ISBN|3161487508}} page 29&lt;/ref&gt;  The criterion states that if a saying attributed to Jesus is different from the Jewish traditions of his time and also from the early Church that followed him, it is likely to be authentic.&lt;ref name=Gregg29 /&gt;

==Description==

The criterion of dissimilarity was introduced by [[Ernst Käsemann]], who in 1953 started the second [[quest for the historical Jesus]].&lt;ref name=GerdD122&gt;''The Quest for the Plausible Jesus: The Question of Criteria'' by Gerd Theissen and Dagmar Winter (Aug 30, 2002) {{ISBN|0664225373}} page 122&lt;/ref&gt; Käsemann writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]here is an almost complete lack of satisfactory and water-tight criteria for this material. In only one case do we have more or less safe ground under our feet: when there are no grounds either for deriving a tradition from Judaism or for ascribing it to primitive Christianity, and especially when Jewish Christianity has mitigated or modified the received tradition, as having been too bold for its taste. (Käsemann, ''Essays on New Testament Themes'', p. 37)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Tim Widowfield, [http://vridar.org/2014/04/23/defending-the-criterion-of-dissimilarity/ "Defending the criterion of dissimilarity"] (''Vridar'' blog post), 2014-04-23. Retrieved 2017-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, the criterion postulates that traditions about Jesus derive from (only) three sources: extrapolation from earlier Jewish traditions, revisionism by the early Christian Church, and true historical accounts of Jesus's ministry. If some tradition cannot be adequately explained by extrapolation nor by revisionism, then it must necessarily be a trace of the historical Jesus.

== Limitations ==

The criterion has received criticism for leading to reconstructions of Jesus as being in implausible discontinuity with the early Jewish traditions that preceded him and the early Christian traditions that followed from him. One such critic writes: "The problem of the Criterion of Double Dissimilarity is that the more we know about early Jewish traditions and the more we know about early Christian post-Easter traditions, the less space there is for a reconstruction of the authentic sayings of Jesus, as by definition they have to differ from early Jewish and early Christian traditions. Therefore, in the end, no trace of a historical Jesus remains."&lt;ref&gt;Oegema, Gerbern S. ''Apocalyptic Interpretation of the Bible''. 2012. pg. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more fundamental criticism of the criterion of dissimiliarity was identified by [[Richard Carrier]]. He identifies two fundamental flaws in the validity of the criterion:

# We are severely limited in our ability to know fundamental details about [[Second Temple Judaism|second-temple Judaism]] and the early Christian church due to an almost total destruction and neglect of documentary records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/747547724|title=The criteria for authenticity in historical-Jesus research : previous discussion and new proposals|last=1956-|first=Porter, Stanley E.,|date=2000|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|isbn=9780567520982|location=Sheffield, England|oclc=747547724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Tuckett concurs: "The very existence of the tradition may thus mitigate against its being regarded as 'dissimilar' to the views of 'the early church.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60362885|title=The Cambridge companion to Jesus|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Bockmuehl, Markus N.

# There is no valid method for distinguishing between a dissimilar statement of Jesus that was actually said and a dissimilar statement of Jesus that was invented by later authors. Any motivation to preserve a dissimilar statement is also motivation to invent one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/764387191|title=Proving history : Bayes's theorem and the quest for the historical Jesus|last=1969-|first=Carrier, Richard,|date=2012|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=9781616145590|location=Amherst, N.Y.|oclc=764387191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5099">[[Image:Dendera light 002.jpg|300px|thumb|The "Dendera light", showing the single representation on the left wall of the right wing in one of the crypts]]

The '''Dendera light''' is a motif carved as a set of stone reliefs in the [[Hathor temple]] at [[Dendera]] in Egypt, which superficially resemble modern [[electric lighting]] devices. A [[fringe hypothesis]] suggests that the Dendera light depicts advanced electrical technology possessed by the [[ancient Egyptians]]; however, mainstream [[Egyptologist]]s view the carvings as representing instead a typical set of symbolic images from [[Egyptian mythology]]. These depict a ''[[djed]]'' pillar and a [[Nymphaea caerulea|lotus flower]] spawning a snake inside it, symbols of stability and fertility, respectively.

==Mainstream interpretation==
The view of [[Egyptologist]]s is that the relief is a [[Egyptian mythology|mythological]] depiction of a ''[[djed]]'' pillar and a lotus flower (''[[Nymphaea caerulea]]''), spawning a snake within, representing aspects of [[Egyptian mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Waitkus, ''Die Texte in den unteren Krypten des Hathortempels von Dendera: ihre Aussagen zur Funktion und Bedeutung dieser Räume'', Mainz 1997 {{ISBN|3-8053-2322-0}} (tr., ''The texts in the lower crypts of the Hathor temples of Dendera: their statements for the function and meaning of these areas'')
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "aft"&gt;"''[http://users.iafrica.com/g/gr/grenvill/denderah.htm Dendera Temple Crypt]''". iafrica.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''djed'' pillar is a symbol of stability which is also interpreted as the backbone of the god Osiris. In the carvings the four horizontal lines forming the capital of the ''djed'' are supplemented by human arms stretching out, as if the ''djed'' were a backbone. The arms hold up the snake within the lotus flower. The snakes coming from the lotus symbolize fertility, linked to the annual [[Nile]] flood.&lt;ref name = "aft"/&gt;

==Fringe interpretation==
In contrast to the mainstream interpretation, a [[fringe hypothesis]] proposes that the reliefs depict Ancient Egyptian electrical technology, based on comparison to similar modern devices (such as [[Geissler tube]]s, [[Crookes tube]]s, and [[arc lamp]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Childress, D. H. (2000). Technology of the gods: the incredible sciences of the ancients. Kempton, Ill: Adventures Unlimited Press. {{ISBN|0932813739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufo.se/ufofiles/english/issue_2/pretech2.html Electricity in ancient times]. WUFOC and NÄRKONTAKT.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Norman Lockyer|J. N. Lockyer]]'s passing reference to a colleague's humorous suggestion that electric lamps would explain the absence of [[lampblack]] deposits in the tombs has sometimes been forwarded as an argument supporting this particular interpretation (another argument being made is the use of a system of reflective mirrors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lockyer |first= J. Norman |authorlink= Joseph Norman Lockyer|title= The Dawn of Astronomy|origyear= 1894|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=62Wr_xF75dMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;sig=wxM2xa-A55rGNKxvdOZUrgUei6c&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&amp;cad=1_0#PPA180,M1|date= |year= 1998|publisher= Kessinger Publishing|isbn= 1564591123|pages= 180–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Proponents of this interpretation have also used a text referring to "high poles covered with copper plates" to argue this&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Kolbe, Francis ed Legge, Joseph Skellon, tr., "''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=0o90G64Z2FDIyKUsLs9&amp;id=150IAAAAIAAJ An Introduction to Electricity]''". Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner, 1908. 429 pages.  Page 391. (cf., "[...] ''high poles covered with copper plates and with gilded tops were erected 'to break the stones coming from on high'.'' J. Dümichen, Baugeschichte des Dendera-Tempels, Strassburg, 1877")&lt;/ref&gt; but Bolko Stern has written in detail explaining why the copper covered tops of poles (which were lower than the associated pylons) do not relate to electricity or lightning, pointing out that no evidence of anything used to manipulate electricity had been found in Egypt and that this was a magical and not a technical installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stern | first = Bolko | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Ägyptische Kulturgeschichte | publisher = Reprint-Verlag-Leipzig | origyear = 1896| year = 1998 | location = | pages = 106–108 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-3826219085 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Fordism is "the eponymous manufacturing system designed to spew out standardized, low-cost goods and afford its workers decent enough wages to buy them."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeG05|De Grazia 2005]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been described as "a model of economic expansion and technological progress based on mass production: the manufacture of standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor."&lt;ref name="TollidaySteven"&gt;Tolliday, Steven &amp; Zeitlin, Jonathan. ''The Automobile Industry and its Workers: Between Fordism and Flexibility'', St. Martin's Press (New York: 1987) pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fordism was a method used to improve productivity in the automotive industry, the principle could be applied to any kind of manufacturing process. Major success stemmed from three major principles:

# The standardization of the product (nothing is handmade, but everything is made through machines and molds by unskilled workers)
# The employment of [[assembly line]]s, which use special-purpose tools and/or equipment to allow unskilled workers to contribute to the finished product
# Workers are paid higher "living" wages so that they can afford to purchase the products they make&lt;ref name="TollidaySteven" /&gt;

The principles, coupled with a technological revolution during Henry Ford's time, allowed for his revolutionary form of labor to flourish. His assembly line was revolutionary though not original as it had previously been used at slaughterhouses. His most original contribution to the modern world was breaking down complex tasks into simpler ones, with the help of specialised tools.&lt;ref name="Editedby"&gt;Edited by; Burrows, Rober; Gilbert, Nigel; Pollert, Anna. ''Fordism and Flexibility: Divisions and Change'' St. Martin's Press (New York: 1992) pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpler tasks created interchangeable parts that could be used the same every time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dt13as.html|title=A Science Odyssey: People and Discoveries: Ford installs first moving assembly line|author=|date=|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; That allowed for a very adaptable flexibility, creating an assembly line that could change its constituent components to meet the needs of the product being assembled.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; In reality, the assembly line had already been around before Ford although not in quite the same effectiveness as he would create. His real accomplishment was recognizing the potential by breaking it all down into its components, only to build it back up again in a more effective and productive combination, thereby producing an optimum method for the real world.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt;

The major advantages of such a change was that it cut down on the manpower necessary for the factory to operate, and it deskilled the labour itself, cutting down on costs of production.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; There are four levels of Fordism, as described by [[Bob Jessop]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Ford Motor Company assembly line.jpg|thumb|Ford cars (Model A shown) became a symbol of effective mass production. Efficiency both decreased the price of the cars and allowed Ford to increase his workers' wages. Hence, common workers could buy their own cars.]]

The [[Ford Motor Company]] was one of several hundred small automobile manufacturers that emerged between 1890 and 1910. After five years of producing automobiles, Ford introduced the [[Ford Model T|Model T]], which was simple and light but sturdy enough to drive on the country's primitive roads.&lt;ref name="FonerEric"&gt;Foner, Eric (2006). Give Me Liberty!: An American History. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, pp. 591–592.&lt;/ref&gt; The mass production of this automobile lowered its unit price, making it affordable for the average consumer. Furthermore, Ford substantially increased his workers' wages&lt;ref&gt;Sward, Keith (1948). The Legend of Henry Ford. New York: Rinehart &amp; Company, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; to combat rampant absenteeism and employee turnover, which approached 400% annually, which had the byproduct of giving them the means to become customers. That led to massive consumption. In fact, the Model T surpassed all expectations because it attained a peak of 60% of the automobile output within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rae, John B. (1969). Henry Ford. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production system that Ford exemplified involved synchronization, precision, and specialization within a company.&lt;ref&gt;Rae, John B. (1969). Henry Ford. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford and his senior managers did not use the word "Fordism" themselves to describe their motivations or worldview, which they did not consider an "[[wikt:ism#Noun|ism]]". However, many contemporaries framed their worldview as one and applied the name Fordism to it.&lt;ref name="Hounshell_1984_pp263,376"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pages=263, 376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term gained prominence when it was used by [[Antonio Gramsci]] in 1934 in his essay "Americanism and Fordism" in his ''[[Prison Notebooks]]''. Since then, it has been used by a number of writers on [[economics]] and society, mainly but not exclusively in the [[Marxist]] tradition.

According to historian [[Charles S. Maier]], Fordism proper was preceded in Europe by [[Taylorism]], a technique of labor discipline and workplace organization, based upon supposedly-scientific studies of human efficiency and incentive systems. It attracted European intellectuals, especially in Germany and Italy, from the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' to [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

After 1918, however, the goal of Taylorist labor efficiency thought in Europe moved to "Fordism," the reorganization of the entire productive process by the moving assembly line, standardization, and the mass market. The grand appeal of Fordism in Europe was that it promised to sweep away all the archaic residues of precapitalist society, by subordinating the economy, society, and even the human personality to the strict criteria of technical rationality.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; The [[Great Depression]] blurred the utopian vision of American [[technocracy]], but [[World War II]] and its aftermath revived the ideal.

The principles of Taylorism were quickly picked up by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and applied to the industrialization of the [[Soviet Union]].

Later, under the inspiration of Gramsci, Marxists picked up the Fordism concept in the 1930s and developed [[Post-Fordism]] in the 1970s. Antonio and Bonanno (2000) trace the development of Fordism and subsequent economic stages, from globalization to neoliberal globalization, during the 20th century, and emphasized America's role in globalization. "Fordism," for Gramsci, meant routine, intensified labor to promote production. Antonio and Bonanno argue that Fordism peaked in the post-World War II decades of American dominance and mass [[consumerism]] but collapsed from political and cultural attacks on the people in the 1970s.

Advances in technology and the end of the [[Cold War]] ushered in a new "neoliberal" phase of globalization in the 1990s. Antonio and Bonanno further suggest that negative elements of Fordism, such as economic inequality, remained, allowing related cultural and environmental troubles, which inhibited America's pursuit of democracy to surface.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio and Bonanno, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Thomas Hughes has detailed how the [[Soviet Union]], in the 1920s and the 1930s, enthusiastically embraced Fordism and Taylorism by importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan]] and the centrally-[[planned economy]] can be traced directly to the influence of Taylorism on Soviet thinking. Hughes quotes [[Joseph Stalin]]:&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;Hughes, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"American efficiency is that indomitable force which neither knows nor recognizes obstacles; which continues on a task once started until it is finished, even if it is a minor task; and without which serious constructive work is inconceivable.... The combination of the Russian revolutionary sweep with American efficiency is the essence of Leninism."&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;{{rp|251}}}}

Hughes describes how, as the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both the Soviets and the Americans chose to ignore or deny the contribution of American ideas and expertise. The Soviets did so because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to their rivals. Americans did so because they did not wish to acknowledge, during the Cold War, their part in creating a powerful rival.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;

==Regulation theory==
{{original research|date=November 2012}}

Fordism is a key concept in the theories of the [[Regulation school]], often in contrast to [[post-Fordism]], and the term is also used in [[Western Marxism|Western Marxist]] thought.

[[File:Mall culture jakarta36.jpg|thumb|Mass consumption is the other side of Fordism.]]

In Regulation theory, it is a "regime of accumulation" or a macroeconomic pattern of growth, developed in the US and diffused in various forms to Western Europe after 1945. It consisted of domestic [[mass production]] with a range of institutions and policies supporting mass consumption, including stabilizing [[economic policies]] and [[Keynesian]] demand management that generated national demand and social stability; it also included a class compromise or social contract entailing family-supporting wages, job stability and internal labor markets leading broadly shared prosperity: rising incomes were linked to national productivity from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. At the level of the labor process Fordism is [[Taylorist]] and as a national mode of regulation Fordism is [[Keynesianism]].

The social-scientific concept of "Fordism" was introduced by the French [[regulation school]], sometimes known as [[regulation theory]], which is a Marxist-influenced strand of political economy. According to the regulation school, capitalist production paradigms are born from the crisis of the previous paradigm; a newborn paradigm is also bound to fall into crisis sooner or later. The crisis of Fordism became apparent to Marxists in late 1960s.

Marxist regulation theory talks of Regimes of Capital Accumulation (ROA) and Modes of Regulation (MOR). ROAs are periods of relatively settled economic growth and profit across a nation or global region. Such regimes eventually become exhausted, falling into crisis, and are torn down as capitalism seeks to remake itself and return to a period of profit. Such periods of capital accumulation are "underpinned," or stabilised, by MOR. A plethora of laws, institutions, social mores, customs and hegemonies both national and international work together to create the environment for long-run capitalist profit.

Fordism is a tag used to characterise the post-1945 long boom experienced by western nations. It is typified by a cycle of mass production and mass consumption, the production of standardized (most often) consumer items to be sold in (typically) protected domestic markets, and the use of Keynesian economic policies. While the standard pattern is postwar America, national variations of this standard norm are well known. Regulation theory talks of National Modes of Growth to denote different varieties of Fordism across western economies.

Fordism as an ROA broke down, dependent on national experiences, somewhere between the late 1960s and the mid-1970s. Western economies experienced slow or nil economic growth, rising inflation and growing unemployment, much of this as a result of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil shock]].

==Post-Fordism==
[[File:Office Worker with Two Monitors.JPG|thumb|Information technology, white-collar work, and specialization are some of the attributes of post-Fordism.]]

The period after Fordism has been termed [[Post-Fordism|Post-Fordist]] and Neo-Fordist. The former implies that global capitalism has made a clean break from Fordism, including overcoming its inconsistencies, but the latter implies that elements of the Fordist ROA continued to exist. The Regulation School preferred the term After-Fordism (or the French ''Après-Fordisme'') to denote that what comes after Fordism was or is not clear.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, S. Brave new world. ''Marxism Today'', October 1988, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Post-Fordist economies:&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;
* New information technologies are important.
* Products are marketed to [[niche market]]s rather than in mass consumption patterns based on [[social class]].
* [[Service industry|Service industries]] predominate over manufacturing.
* The workforce is feminized.
* Financial markets are globalized.

A religion based on the worship of [[Henry Ford]] is a central feature of the [[technocracy]] in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s  ''[[Brave New World]]'', where the principles of mass production are applied to the generation of people as well as to industry.&lt;ref&gt;"''Brave New World'' is a critique of this streamlining process, of its all-too-pragmatic father Henry Ford, and finally of the Fordist workers whose lives of repetitive labor and goals of material comfort appeared to have triumphed over notions of intellectual inquiry and self-reflection".

The '''Golden Sun Bird''' ({{zh|s=太阳神鸟金饰|t=太陽神鳥金飾|p=Tàiyáng Shénniǎo Jīnshì}}) is an ancient [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], unearthed in 2001 from the [[Jinsha (archaeological site)|Jinsha Ruins]] in [[Chengdu]] City, [[Sichuan]] Province, [[People's Republic of China|China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=unknown |url=http://www.chinese-treasures.net/node/54 |title=Gold Sunbird |publisher=Chinese Treasures |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a ring-shaped piece of foil, made of nearly pure [[gold]]. The pattern consists of four [[birds]], flying in the same [[counterclockwise]] direction, located around the perimeter. The center is a sun pattern with twelve points. It is 12.5&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, with a 5.29&amp;nbsp;cm inner diameter. It has a thickness of 0.02&amp;nbsp;cm, and weighs 20 grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/chinanews/2005-08/16/content_4918640_1.htm |title=:: 新华网 :: - 地方联播 |publisher=Xinhuanet.com |date=2005-08-16 |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece is from the late [[Sanxingdui]] culture, and is now located in the [[Chengdu Jinsha Ruins Museum]].

{{Central America series}}

The '''history of Central America''' is the study of the region known as [[Central America]].

== Before European contact ==
In the [[Pre-Columbian era]], the northern areas of the relaxing Central America were inhabited by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] peoples of [[Mesoamerica]]. Most notable among these were the [[Maya peoples|Mayans]], who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the [[Aztec]]s, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern [[El Salvador]], eastern [[Honduras]], Caribbean [[Nicaragua]], most of [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]] were predominantly speakers of the [[Chibchan languages]] at the time of European contact and are considered by some&lt;ref name=Hoopes&amp;Fonseca2003/&gt; culturally different and grouped in the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area]].

== Spanish Colonial Era ==
{{see also|Spanish conquest of Guatemala|Spanish conquest of Petén|Spanish conquest of Honduras|Spanish conquest of El Salvador|Spanish conquest of Nicaragua |label 2=Petén| label 3=Honduras| label 4=El Salvador |label 5=Nicaragua}}
Central America is composed of seven independent nations: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. After the Spanish conquest in the 16th century, most of the inhabitants of Central America shared a similar history. The exception was the [[Western Caribbean Zone]], which included the Caribbean coast and encompassed both semi-independent indigenous polities, runaway slave communities, and settlers, especially British settlers who would eventually form  [[British Honduras]] (the modern-day nation of [[Belize]]), a sparsely populated area that was inhabited by the British through the Treaty of Madrid from Spain. When Spain failed to regain control over British Honduras, the British continued to inhabit the country and and eventually colonized it. When Guatemala gained its independence, they assumed inheritance of British Honduras from Spain. British Honduras had been a British settlement, not a colony (the treaty between Spain and The United Kingdom prohibited British colonies in the territory) for several years. After many years of controversy, a treaty was signed between Guatemala and the United Kingdom in which the Guatemalan President of the time recognized the original territory (granted by the kingdom of Spain to the British Crown) of Belize. Within this treaty, was also an agreement for a cart road to be built from Guatemala City through British Honduras to the Caribbean Sea. Since the cart road was never built, Guatemala declared the treaty null and void. British Honduras, as the British called it, and Belize as the Spaniards and Guatemalans said, gained its independence from Great Britain in 1981 and adopted the name "Belize". Guatemala still disputes the Belizean territory.

From the 16th century through 1821, Central America formed the [Captaincy General of Guatemala], sometimes known also as the Kingdom of Guatemala, composed by a part of the state of [Chiapas] (nowadays part of Mexico), [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]].  Officially, the Captaincy was part of the Vice royalty of [[New Spain]] and therefore under the supervision of the Spanish [[viceroy]] in [[Mexico City]]. It was, however, administered not by the viceroy or his deputies, but by an independently appointed Captain General headquartered first in [[Antigua Guatemala|Antigua]] and later in [[Guatemala City]].

== Independence    ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Declaration of independence]] --&gt;
In 1811, [[1811 Independence Movement|independence movements]] broke out in El Salvador in reaction to events in the [[Peninsular War]], and again in 1814 after the restoration of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]]. Both revolts were easily suppressed and the political unrest was subsumed into the general political process in the Spanish world that led to the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]]. Between 1810 and 1814, the Captaincy General elected seven representatives to the [[Cádiz Cortes]], in addition to forming a locally elected Provincial Deputation.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Laure Rieu-Millan. ''Los diputados americanos en las Cortes de Cádiz: Igualdad o independencia.'' Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 1990, 43. {{ISBN|978-84-00-07091-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821 a congress of Central American ''[[Spanish Criollo peoples|Criollos]]'' in Guatemala City composed the [[Act of Independence of Central America]] to declare the region's independence from Spain, effective on 15 September of that year.&lt;ref name="documentos"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Documentos de la Union Centroamericana|website = Organization of American States - Foreign Trade Information System|url = http://www.sice.oas.org/sica/Studies/DocUnionCentroamericana.pdf|format = pdf|accessdate = 12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That date is still marked as [[independence Day|independence day]] by most Central American nations. The Spanish Captain General, [[Gabino Gaínza]], sympathized with the rebels and it was decided that he should stay on as interim leader until a new government could be formed. Independence was short-lived, for the conservative leaders in Guatemala welcomed annexation by the [[First Mexican Empire]] of [[Agustín de Iturbide]] on 5 January 1822. Central American [[liberalism|liberals]] objected to this, but an army from Mexico under General [[Vicente Filisola]] occupied Guatemala City and quelled dissent.

When Mexico became a [[republic]] the following year, it acknowledged Central America's right to determine its own destiny. On 1 July 1823, the congress of Central America declared absolute independence from Spain, Mexico, and any other foreign nation, including North America and a [[Republic]]an system of government, was established.

=== United Provinces of Central America 2018 ===
{{main|Federal Republic of Central America}}
In 1823, the nation of Central America was formed. It was intended to be a [[federal republic]] modeled after the [[United States|United States of America]]. It was provisionally known as "The United Provinces of Central America," while the final name according to the Constitution of 1824 was "The Federal Republic of Central America." It is sometimes incorrectly referred in English as "The United States of Central America." The Central American nation consisted of the states of [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]]. In the 1830s, an additional state was added, [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]], with its capital in [[Quetzaltenango]], occupying parts of what is now the western highlands of Guatemala as well as part of [[Chiapas]] (now part of Mexico), but this state was reincorporated into Guatemala and Mexico respectively in 1840.

Central American liberals had high hopes for the federal republic, which they believed would evolve into a modern, democratic nation, enriched by trade crossing through it between the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans. These aspirations are reflected in the emblems of the federal republic: The flag shows a white band between two blue stripes, representing the land between two oceans. The coat of arms shows five mountains (one for each state) between two oceans, surmounted by a [[Phrygian cap]], the emblem of the [[French Revolution]].

The Union dissolved in [[civil war]] between 1838 and 1840. Its disintegration began when [[Nicaragua]] separated from the federation on November 5, 1838.

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
'''UPCA'''

'''The United Provinces of Central America''' (or PUCA- Provincias Unidas De Centro-America in Spanish) is the name given to the different states of Central America in the time after Central America's independence and before becoming their own distinct nations (between 1823-1840&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Editors of Encyclopedia|first1=Britannica|title=United Provinces of Central America|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/United-Provinces-of-Central-America|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). It was a political movement that strived to unify the regions of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Guatemala (Panama and Belize at the time were under separate ownership) under a liberal federal government and believed that united they would be a stronger political unit. Unfortunately, due to many strong political disagreements within the different states, the UPCA eventually disbanded and the regions became separate nations with devastating political and economic civil wars that are still felt today.

The [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|kingdom of Guatemala]], as Central America was more commonly known as during Spanish and Mexican rule, was annexed into Mexico in 1822 under the rule of emperor [[Agustín de Iturbide]]. Shortly after, opposition from Central Americans began against the monarch and they pushed for independence from Mexico. Iturbide's unsuccessful leadership of Central America caused his party to fail against the uprising rebels and on July 1, 1823, Central America gained its independence.

After independence, officials from the different regions gathered in a junta to decide the future of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala. They decided to unite into a federation of five autonomous states, thus creating the UPCA, a term coined by Brigadier General [[Vicente Filisola]], who was stationed in [[Guatemala City]].

The UPCA's aims were to be a liberal government with political principles modeled after the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foster|first1=Lyn|title=A Brief History of Central America|date=April 15, 2016|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|isbn=9780816066711|pages=135–160|edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also to remain united. They felt that the “provinces alone were too small and weak economically to survive as sovereign states” so they “avert[ed] fragmentation of the isthmus”&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Central America"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foster|first1=Lyn|title=A Brief History of Central America|date=April 15, 2016|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|isbn=9780816066711|pages=136|edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt; and pushed for union. However, the UPCA soon noticed that there were many political ideals between the regions and conservative parties on the other end of the political spectrum actively showed their discontent under the new liberal regime. 
Despite this, the beginning of the federation went relatively smooth and negotiations helped them reform borders, capital cities were moved to accommodate the citizens, and economies of coffee grew high. All the while, tensions between the liberals and conservatives and power struggles within the different economies increasingly grew.

One the most notable key figures of UPCA was [[Francisco Morazan]], a liberal advocate who was chosen president of the UPCA. In the 1820s and through the 1830s Morazan took an active role in liberal movements throughout Central America, especially in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras against conservative parties. These battles between parties increasingly divided the nation causing sour relationships and distance between them. Differences between liberals who wanted [[free trade]], favored a republic and had anti-clerical views contested those of the conservatives who wanted a monarchy, trade under close control and power to the church.  These conflicts, along with [[cholera]] outbreaks, foreign intervention and distress among those in poverty caused many insurgencies those rose up against liberal movements and vice versa resulted in various civil wars throughout Central America.

Morazan was captured in Costa Rica by the conservative party and they assassinated him on September 15, 1842),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearcy|first1=Thomas|title=The History of Central America|date=April 15, 2016|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0313322937|pages=40–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; which marked the official end of the UPCA. Upon notification of his death, greater turmoil and fights among the opposing liberal and conservative parties increased. It is said that the conservative-liberal struggles that Morazan campaigned for are still in effect today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearcy|first1=Thomas|title=The History of Central America|date=April 15, 2016|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0313322937|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, lacking a central authority proved to be unproductive and created more disputes and distrust within the different nations. In fact, foreigners who were looking to make economic and/or political negations were told that they had to go to each individual region for consultations and found it inconvenient.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Central America"/&gt;
The desire for power and their inability to overcome bad relations among each other led to the fall of the UPCA. Nicaragua, Honduras, and Costa Rica seceded from the union in 1838. In 1839 Guatemala seceded, and in 1840 El Salvador did the same.

The provinces shortly after became their own separate republican nations, of which we are more familiar with today and eventually Panama and Belize joined what we know today as “Central America.” Tensions among the different nations, however, continued to grow more aggressive throughout the rest of the 19th century. Despite knowing that being unified would overall work better for Central America, they remained separate. Though many attempts to reunite the nations have been attempted throughout the years it always resulted with unsuccessful results. Civil wars continued to be part of Central America through the 20th and parts of the 21st century as well.

=== Greater Republic of Central America ===
{{Main|Greater Republic of Central America}}
Various attempts were made to reunite Central America in the 19th century, but none succeeded for any length of time:

* The first attempt was in 1842 by former President [[Francisco Morazán]], who was quickly captured and executed. The abortive attempt proposed to restore the union as the Confederation of Central America and planned to include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. This first attempt lasted until 1844.
* A second attempt was made and lasted from October to November 1852, when El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua created a Federation of Central America (Federacion de Centro America).
* Guatemalan President [[Justo Rufino Barrios]] attempted to reunite the nation by force of arms in the 1880s and was killed in the process, like his 1842 predecessor.
* The third union of Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador as the Greater [[Republic of Central America]] or "Republica Mayor de Centroamerica" lasted from 1896 to 1898.
* The last attempt occurred between June 1921 and January 1922 when El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica formed a (second) Federation of Central America. The treaty establishing this federation was signed at San José, Costa Rica on January 19, 1921. This second Federation was nearly moribund from the start, having only a provisional Federal Council made up of delegates from each state.

Despite the failure of a lasting political union, the concept of Central American reunification, though lacking enthusiasm from the leaders of the individual countries, arose from time to time. In 1856-1857, the region successfully established a military coalition to repel an invasion by [[United States|U.S.]] adventurer [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]].  Today, all five nations fly [[flag]]s that retain the old federal motif of two outer blue bands bounding an inner white stripe. ([[Costa Rica]], traditionally the least committed of the five to regional integration, modified its flag significantly in 1848 by darkening the blue and adding a double-wide inner red band, in honor of the French tricolor).

== The liberal reforms period ==
Even though the dates for this period change from country to country, they approximately correspond to the years between 1870 and 1930. During this time, political elites in the five Central American countries advanced reforms on agriculture, commerce, and redefined the relationship between the state, society and the economy. The most relevant political figures during this period were the presidents [[Justo Rufino Barrios]] in Guatemala, [[Rafael Zaldivar]] in El Salvador, [[Braulio Carrillo Colina]] and [[Tomas Guardia]] in Costa Rica, [[Marco Aurelio Soto]] in Honduras, and [[Jose Santos Zelaya]] in Nicaragua. The key result of this period in all the Central American countries was a transition from communal to private ownership of land. The extent to which liberals targeted common lands for [[privatization]] varied from country to country. Likewise, there were important differences in the size of the commercial landholding estate. Another variation among the policies promoted by the liberal governments was the use of coercion and security organizations in to implement reforms to the land ownership policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahoney|first=James|date=2001-03-01|title=Path-Dependent Explanations of Regime Change: Central America in Comparative Perspective|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02687587|journal=Studies in Comparative International Development|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=111–141|doi=10.1007/BF02687587|issn=0039-3606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th century ==
In 1907, a [[Central American Court of Justice]] was created. On December 13, 1960, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua established the [[Central American Common Market]] (CACM). Costa Rica chose not to participate in the CACM. The goals for the CACM were to create greater political unification and success of [[import substitution industrialization]] policies. The project was an immediate economic success but was abandoned after the 1969 "[[Football War]]" between El Salvador and Honduras.

By the 1930s the [[United Fruit Company]] owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala. Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries. That was one of the factors that led to the coining of the phrase [[Banana Republic]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=WH5jDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Central American Parliament]] has operated, as a purely advisory body, since 1991. The regional parliament seat deputies from the four former members of the Union (Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras), as well as from [[Panama]] and the [[Dominican Republic]].

Another initiative is known as [[Free Movement of Persons in the CA-4]], which has opened the borders between Nicaragua and Guatemala removing the need to carry a passport to cross borders, just a national ID ([[cédula de identidad]]) is enough to cross borders.  This initiative is the result of negotiations of the [[Central American Commission of Directors of Migration]] (OCAM) with the support of the [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM).  This initiative has been in effect since 2007.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Since a state of war has been existing between [[Israel]] and [[Syria]] several independent peace initiatives had taken place. Some of them were symbolic, other included more direct steps to get Israelis and Syrians together. Most of them were led by Israeli citizens and by Syrians living abroad.

==Notable Independent Israel-Syria Peace Initiatives==
* '''Alon Liel''', former [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Israel Foreign Ministry]] director general [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2001/4/Dr%20Alon%20Liel], held unofficial talks with Syrian mediaries under the Swiss government's patronage over 2004-2007. He had also initiated a peace movement that published a petition by hundreds of [[Golan Heights]] residents to open peace talks with Syria. [http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3431770,00.html].
* The Israeli band '''[[PingPong (band)|PingPong]]''' tried to promote peace between Israel and Syria during their performance on [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000]].
* '''Ibrahim Suleiman''', Syrian-American negotiator has visited the [[Knesset]] [[Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee]] on April 2007 [http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=451913&amp;TypeID=1&amp;sid=126], insisting that a peace deal with Syria is reachable within six months since Syrian president [[Bashar al-Assad]] is in favor of it. The Israeli Foreign Ministry officially rejected Suleiman's meeting with Israeli officials [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/847617.html].

The '''International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania''' is a commission appointed by the [[President of Lithuania]], [[Valdas Adamkus]], by presidential decree on 7 September 1998. The Commission is tasked with investigating the crimes committed during the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupation of Lithuania]] by the Soviet Union and Germany that lasted from 14 June 1940 to 11 March 1990. The commission consists of two subcommissions, each dealing with the 48 years of Soviet occupation and the 3 years of German occupation respectively. The Chairman of the Commission is [[Emanuelis Zingeris]] MP (since 1998). The Commission is a member institution of the [[European Union]]'s [[Platform of European Memory and Conscience]].

In 2012, financing of the commission was renewed by presidential decree by President [[Dalia Grybauskaitė]] and new commission members appointed. The new commission members include [[Dina Porat]] and Arkadiy Zeltser (both of [[Yad Vashem]]), Andrew Baker (of the [[American Jewish Committee]]), Saulius Sužiedėlis (of [[Millersville University]]), Kęstutis Grinius (of [[Vilnius University]]), Alexander Daniel (of [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]]), Nicolas Lane (of the [[American Jewish Committee]]), [[Timothy D. Snyder]] (of [[Yale University]]), Françoise Thom (of [[Sorbonne University]]), [[Janos M. Rainer]], and [[Arvydas Anušauskas]] (chairman of the Seimas Committee on National Security and Defense). [[Emanuelis Zingeris]] was again appointed chairman of the commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.15min.lt/en/article/in-lithuania/lithuanian-president-resumes-international-commission-to-evaluate-nazi-and-soviet-crimes-525-244776 Lithuanian president resumes international commission to evaluate Nazi and Soviet crimes], 15min.lt, 29 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1961">'''Jean-Joseph Raepsaet''' (29 December 1750 in [[Oudenaarde]] – 19 February 1832) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] politician and historian.

==Biography==
Jean-Joseph Raepsaet was born to a family that had grown from rural civil servants in the south-east of the [[County of Flanders]] to the highest ranks of society. He was the grandson of Jan Arent Raepsaet (1680-1752), scribe of Heestert, and Agnes Valcke. His father, Jan Raepsaet (died 1774) was the lawyer and clerk of the [[Castellany]] of Oudenaarde, and his mother was Maria Joanna Vispoel, daughter of the Grand Pensionary of Oudenaarde.

Raepsaet went to school in Oudenaarde and high school in [[Menen]] and [[Bergen]]. He studied [[philosophy]] and law at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Louvain]], where he received his degree in law on 17 December 1772. A month later, on 16 January 1773, he became a lawyer at the Council of [[Flanders]]. He settled down in his hometown and became clerk of the chancellery.

He became one of the leading voices of the conservative party in Oudenaarde, and he disputed the reformations of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of the Holy Roman Emperor]], while at the same time supporting the closing of several monasteries and the abolition of hermitages.

On 20 May 1777, Jean-Joseph Raepsaet married Maria Olympa Bauwens, daughter of another high-ranking official from Oudenaarde, in [[Antwerp]]. Together they had seventeen children, of whom six died before reaching adulthood.
Of the twelve that remained, six didn't marry, and the remaining six only had a modest number of children which, combined with the division of the inheritance between the many children, caused the name of Raepsaet to disappear from high society.

'''Joel Mokyr''' (born 26 July 1946) is a [[Netherlands]]-born American-Israeli [[economic historian]]. He is a professor of economics and history at [[Northwestern University]], where he has taught since 1974; in 1994 he was named the [[Robert H. Strotz]] Professor of Arts and Sciences. He is also a Sackler Professorial Fellow at the [[University of Tel Aviv]]'s Eitan Berglas School of Economics.&lt;ref name = "cv"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Mokyr was born in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]]. His father, a civil servant, and his mother were [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]] who survived the [[Holocaust]]. His father died of cancer when Mokyr was one year old, so he was raised by his mother in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/economists-duel-over-idea-that-technology-will-save-the-world-1402886301|title=Economists Debate: Has All the Important Stuff Already Been Invented?|last=Aeppel|first=Timothy|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mokyr earned a B.A. in economics and history from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in 1968. He earned an M.Phil. in economics in 1972 and a Ph.D. in economics in 1974, both from [[Yale University]]. His dissertation was about "Industrial Growth and Stagnation in the [[Low Countries]], 1800-1850" and was supervised by William N. Parker.&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=https://sites.northwestern.edu/jmokyr/files/2016/06/Mokyr-CV-296d1iv.pdf|website=Northwestern University|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After completing his Ph.D. at Yale University, Mokyr began working at [[Northwestern University]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; A former editor of the ''[[Journal of Economic History]]'' and President of the [[Economic History Association]], he served as the editor-in-chief of the ''[[Oxford University Press|Oxford]] Encyclopedia of Economic History''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joel Mokyr|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Economic History (5Vols)|date=16 October 2003|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] on Demand|isbn=978-0-19-510507-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continues to serve as editor-in-chief of a book series published by [[Princeton University Press]], ''The Princeton University Press Economic History of the Western World''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.princeton.edu/catalogs/series/pehww.html Princeton Economic History of the Western World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101104926/http://press.princeton.edu/catalogs/series/pehww.html|date=1 November 2009}}; accessed 8 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A former chair of the Economics Department and President of the Economic History Association, he is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and a number of comparable institutions in Europe.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} He also serves as editor of the ''[[Essays in Economic and Business History|Essays in Economic &amp; Business History]]''.

He became a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/5204| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213195608/https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/5204|title=Joël Mokyr|publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|archivedate=13 February 2016|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, he was awarded the biennial [[Heineken Prizes|Heineken Award]] for History by the [[Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences]]. He won the 2015 [[Balzan International Prize]] for economic history.&lt;ref name="nwbio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joel Mokyr|url=http://www.economics.northwestern.edu/people/directory/joel-mokyr.html|website=Northwestern University|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
===Industrial Revolution===
Mokyr posits that the [[Industrial Revolution]] was the result of culture and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mokyr|first=Joel|date=1 June 2005|title=The Intellectual Origins of Modern Economic Growth|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/the-intellectual-origins-of-modern-economic-growth/138F07525A5105E29E7113705D393C51|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=65|issue=2|pages=285–351|doi=10.1017/S0022050705000112|issn=1471-6372}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the root of modernity is in "the emergence of a belief in the usefulness of progress", and that "it was a turning point when intellectuals started to conceive of knowledge as cumulative".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/11/progress-isnt-natural-mokyr/507740|title=Progress Isn't Natural|last=Mokyr|first=Joel|newspaper=The Atlantic|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mokyr furthermore argues that political fragmentation (the presence of a large number of European states) made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive, as entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues, and heretics could  easily flee to a neighbouring state in the event that the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities. This is what set Europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires such as China and India. China had both a [[printing press]] and [[movable type]], and India had similar levels scientific and technological achievement as Europe in 1700, yet the Industrial Revolution would occur in Europe, not China or India. In Europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an "integrated market for ideas" where Europe's intellectuals used the lingua franca of [[Latin]], had a shared intellectual basis in Europe's classical heritage and the pan-European institution of the [[Republic of Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10835.html|title=Mokyr, J.: A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy |website=press.princeton.edu|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''A Culture of Growth''====
Mokyr presents his explanations for the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 2016 book ''A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy''. The book has received positive reviews. [[Deirdre McCloskey]] described it as a "brilliant book...  It’s long, but consistently interesting, even witty. It sustains interest right down to page 337... The book is not beach reading. But you will finish it impressively learned about how we got to where we are in the modern world."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/arts-and-books/ideas-that-built-the-world-joel-mokyr-liberalism|title=Economic history: ideas that built the world|website=www.prospectmagazine.co.uk|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review, McCloskey furthermore lauded Mokyr as a "Nobel-worthy economic scientist".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In a review published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', [[J. Bradford DeLong|Brad DeLong]] found that while he favored other explanations for the Industrial Revolution, "I would not be greatly surprised if I were wrong, and Mokyr's brief...turned out to be the most broadly correct analysis...''A Culture of Growth'' is certainly making me rethink."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeLong|first=Brad|date=27 October 2016|title=Economic history: The roots of growth |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v538/n7626/full/538456a.html|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |language=en |volume=538 |issue=7626|pages=456–57|doi=10.1038/538456a|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambridge economic historian [[Victoria Bateman]] wrote, "In pointing to growth-boosting factors that go beyond either the state or the market, Mokyr's book is very welcome. It could also feed into discussions about the scientific community post-[[Brexit]]. By reviving the focus on culture it will, however, prove controversial, particularly among economists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/review-a-culture-of-growth-joel-mokyr-princeton-university-press|title=A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy, by Joel Mokyr|date=6 October 2016|work=Times Higher Education|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has also been reviewed favorably by [[Diane Coyle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/982f6108-95f1-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582|title=Subscribe to read|website=ft.com|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer Vries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2016-12-08/culture-capitalism|title=The Culture of Capitalism|last=Vries|first=Peer|date=10 December 2016|work=Foreign Affairs|accessdate=11 March 2017|issn=0015-7120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Koyama,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?id=1267|title=Book Review: A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy, by Joel Mokyr|website=The Independent Institute|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21711023-new-history-puts-principle-contestability-heart-story|title=The role of ideas in the "great divergence"|website=The Economist|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance to new technologies===
Mokyr outlined three reasons why societies resist new technologies:
* Incumbents who fear a threat to their power and [[economic rent]]s
* Concern about broader social and political repercussions ("unintended ripple effects")
* [[Risk aversion|Risk]] and [[loss aversion]]: new technologies often have "unanticipated and unknowable consequences"

"These three motives often merge and create powerful forces that use political power and persuasion to thwart innovations. As a result, technological progress does not follow a linear and neat trajectory. It is, as social constructionists have been trying to tell us for decades, a profoundly political process."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eh.net/book_reviews/innovation-and-its-enemies-why-people-resist-new-technologies|title=Innovation and Its Enemies: Why People Resist New Technologies|website=eh.net|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period spanned the years from February 1243 to February 1247.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Kangen''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA470&amp;dq=  ''Japan encyclopedia'', p. 470;] n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning emperor was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Saga|Go-Saga]]''-tennō''|後嵯峨天皇}}.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA245,M1  ''Annales des empereurs du Japon'', pp. 245-247;] Varley, H. Paul. (1980). ''Jinnō Shōtōki.'' p. 228-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change of era==
* {{nihongo|'''''Kangen gannen'''''|寛元元年}}; 1243: The new era name was created to mark an event or a number of events. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in ''Ninji'' 4.

==Events of the ''Kangen'' era==
* '''1244''' (''Kangen 2''): In the spring of this year, a number of extraordinary phenomena in the skies over Kamakura troubled [[Kujō Yoritsune|Yoritsune]] deeply.&lt;ref name="t247"&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA247,M1  p. 247.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1244''' (''Kangen 2, 4th month''): Yoritsune's son, Yoritsugu, had his coming-of-age ceremonies at age 6. In the same month, Yoritsune asked Emperor Go-Saga for permission to give up his responsibilities as shōgun in favor of his son, [[Kujō Yoritsugu]].&lt;ref name="t247"/&gt;
* '''September 11, 1245''' (''Kangen 3, 7th month''):  Yoshitsune shaved his head and became a Buddhist priest.&lt;ref name="t247"/&gt;
* '''1246''' (''Kangen 4, 7th month''): Yoritsune's son, now Shōgun Yoritsugu (who is only 7 years old) marries the sister of [[Hōjō Tsunetoki]] (who is himself only 16 years old).&lt;ref name="t247"/&gt;
* '''1246''' (''Kangen 4''): In the 4th year of Go-Saga''-tennō'' 's reign (後嵯峨天皇4年), he abdicated; and despite the succession (''senso'') was received by his 4-year-old son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Fukakusa is said to have acceded to the throne (''sokui'').&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA247,M1  pp. 247-248;]  Varley, p. 44; a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jitō|Jitō]], [[Emperor Yōzei|Yōzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[emperor Go-Murakami]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This historic mission is called the ''Keichō'' Embassy, ({{lang|ja|慶長使節}}).&lt;ref&gt;In the name "''Keichō'' Embassy", the noun "''Keichō''" refers to the ''[[nengō]]''  ([[Japanese era name]]) after "''[[Bunroku]]''" and before "''[[Genna]]''."  In other words, the ''Keichō'' Embassy commenced during ''Keichō'', which was a time period spanning the years from 1596 through 1615.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the return trip, Hasekura and his companions re-traced their route across Mexico in 1619, sailing from Acapulco for Manilla, and then sailing north to Japan in 1620.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs: [http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/mexico/index.html  Japan-Mexico Relations''.]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is conventionally considered the first Japanese ambassador in the [[Americas]] and in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Keichō'' Embassy was, in fact, preceded by a [[Sengoku period]] mission headed by [[Mancio Itō]] with [[Alessandro Valignano]] in 1582–1590. Although less well-known and less well-documented, this historic mission is sometimes referred to as the "''[[Tenshō (Momoyama period)|Tenshō]]'' Embassy" because it was initiated in the  ''Tenshō'' era. This venture was organized by three ''[[daimyō]]s'' of Western Japan – [[Ōmura Sumitada]], [[Ōtomo Sōrin]] and [[Arima Harunobu]].&lt;/ref&gt;

::"[T]he tablet over the Daibatsu-den and the bell bore the inscription ''"Kokka ankō"'' (meaning "the country and the house, peace and tranquility"), and at this Tokugawa Ieyasu affected to take umbrage, alleging that it was intended as a curse on him for the character 安 (''an'', "peace") was placed between the two characters composing his own name 家康 (''"ka-kō"'', "house tranquility") [suggesting subtly perhaps that peace could only be attained by Ieyasu's dismemberment?] ... This incident of the inscription was, of course, a mere [[pretext]], but Ieyasu realized that he could not enjoy the power he had usurped as long as Hideyori lived, and consequently, although the latter more than once dispatched his ''kerei'' Katagiri Kastumoto to [[Sunpu Castle]] with profuse apologies, Ieyasu refused to be placated."&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, ''Kyoto'', p. 292; Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA410,M1  p. 410.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gene Roddenberry|Eugene Wesley "Gene" Roddenberry]] (August 19, 1921 – October 24, 1991) was an American television [[screenwriter]], [[TV producer|producer]] and [[futurist]] best remembered for creating the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original ''Star Trek'' television series]].&lt;ref name=alex204&gt;[[#alexander1995|Alexander (1995)]]: p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Gene Roddenberry was the first television writer to receive a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#pearson2011|Pearson (2011)]]: pp. 105–131&lt;/ref&gt; He was given a [[Macintosh 128K]] by [[Apple Inc.]] in 1986, which was later upgraded by the company and re-designated as a [[Macintosh Plus]] with the production number of M-0001. This started the rumor that Roddenberry had received the first Mac-Plus off the production line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anders|first1=Charlie Jane|title=You Could Own Gene Roddenberry's 1980s Apple Mac|url=http://io9.com/5362205/you-could-own-gene-roddenberrys-1980s-apple-mac|publisher=io9|date=September 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217194041/http://io9.com/5362205/you-could-own-gene-roddenberrys-1980s-apple-mac|archivedate=February 17, 2014|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Sci-Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]] was launched in the United States eleven months after the death of Roddenberry, the first broadcast was a dedication to two "science fiction pioneers":&lt;ref name=xixengel&gt;[[#engel1994|Engel (1994)]]: p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Asimov]] and Roddenberry. His impact on popular culture in the previous thirty years was said to be eclipsed only by that of [[Elvis Presley]].&lt;ref name=xixengel/&gt; Japanese [[astrophysicist]] [[Yoji Kondo]] proposed naming a crater on [[Mars]] after Roddenberry in 1994. This was supported by [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and was agreed to by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. The [[Roddenberry (Martian crater)|Roddenberry crater]] is located at Martian latitude −49.9 degrees and longitude 4.5 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ayers2006|Ayers (2006)]]: p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; He has also had an asteroid named after him, [[4659 Roddenberry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#hamilton2007|Hamilton (2007)]]: p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Roddenberry and ''Star Trek'' have been cited as inspiration for other science fiction franchises. While being interviewed for Rod Roddenberry's ''Trek Nation'', ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]] said: "''Star Trek'' softened up the entertainment arena so that ''Star Wars'' could come along and stand on its shoulders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McIntyre|first1=Gina|title=George Lucas: 'Star Wars' stood on the shoulders of 'Star Trek' |url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/george-lucas-star-wars-stood-on-the-shoulders-of-star-trek/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322001503/http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/george-lucas-star-wars-stood-on-the-shoulders-of-star-trek/|archivedate=March 22, 2015|accessdate=March 22, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Michael Straczynski]], comic book writer, and creator of the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' franchise, said that he had watched a number of 1960s science fiction series, including ''Star Trek'', noting: "I was fortunate enough to see many of those shows on the occasion of their first broadcasts. But it was only much later, with the passage of time and repetition, that I was able to catch them all to truly appreciate what they had accomplished and what they had to say about who we are, and where we are going."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Webster|first1=Dan|title=Roddenberry's ideas have prospered ; 'Star Trek' was an inspiration to 'Babylon 5' creator|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-27353570.html|accessdate=March 22, 2015|work=The Spokesman-Review|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=May 16, 2003|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Gene Roddenberry Award was inaugurated at the fifth FantastiCon convention in Los Angeles.

After meeting David Alexander at a ''Star Trek'' convention in the early 1970s, the duo collaborated on a biography. This was written over the following two decades, with Alexander conducting between 150 and 200 interviews with Roddenberry and others. In total, some fourteen storage boxes of material were collected by Alexander for the production of the book, the only authorized biography of Roddenberry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salles|first1=Andre|title=10 Questions with David Alexander|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-124EE4EFB3F3BE60.html|accessdate=March 22, 2015|work=The Beacon News|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=November 20, 2008|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titled ''Star Trek Creator'', it was published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Museum official, 'Star Trek' expert|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-1342CB9EA6C4E188.html|accessdate=March 22, 2015|work=Chicago Sun-Times|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=December 17, 2010|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other biographies of Roddenberry have also been published, including Joel Engel's ''Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek'' and James Van Hise's ''The Man Who Created Star Trek: Gene Roddenberry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Svetkey|first1=Benjamin|title=Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1994/04/08/gene-roddenberry-myth-and-man-behind-star-trek|accessdate=April 26, 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 8, 1994|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426170641/http://www.ew.com/article/1994/04/08/gene-roddenberry-myth-and-man-behind-star-trek|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#hall1997|Hall (1997)]]: p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Yvonne Fern's book, ''Gene Roddenberry: The Last Conversation'', detailed a series of conversations she had with Roddenberry over the last months on his life.&lt;ref&gt;[[#hall1997|Hall (1997)]]: p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, a plaque was placed at Roddenberry's birthplace in El Paso, Texas. It was paid for from campaign funds by Representative [[Anthony Cobos]], who described El Paso as a "big Trekkie town".&lt;ref name=plaque/&gt; He hoped that the plaque would raise awareness of El Paso in ''Star Trek'' fandom and increase tourism.&lt;ref name=plaque&gt;{{cite news|title=El Paso to Mark Roddenberry's Birth|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-68463052.html|accessdate=March 22, 2015|agency=Associated Press|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=October 4, 2002|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[EMP Museum#Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame|Science Fiction Hall of Fame]] inducted Roddenberry in 2007 alongside [[Ridley Scott]], [[Ed Emshwiller]], and [[Gene Wolfe]] in a ceremony hosted by ''The Next Generation'' alumnus [[Wil Wheaton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ulen|first1=Amy|title=Report: Roddenberry SF Hall of Fame Induction|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/65515.html|publisher=StarTrek.com|date=June 22, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716224043/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/65515.html|archivedate=July 16, 2007|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Fiction Hall of Fame to Induct Ed Emshwiller, Gene Roddenberry, Ridley Scott and Gene Wolfe|url=http://www.empsfm.org/press/index.asp?articleID=892|publisher=empsfm.org|accessdate=April 26, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014112914/http://www.empsfm.org/press/index.asp?articleID=892|archivedate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roddenberry was inducted into the [[Television Academy Hall of Fame]] in January 2010, with a tribute by ''[[Family Guy]]'' creator and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' guest star [[Seth MacFarlane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seth MacFarlane on Gene Roddenberry: Hall of Fame 2010|url=http://www.emmys.com/video/seth-macfarlane-gene-roddenberry-hall-fame-2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715015248/http://www.emmys.com/video/seth-macfarlane-gene-roddenberry-hall-fame-2010|archivedate=July 15, 2014|publisher=Television Academy|date=February 10, 2010|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Production Report: Picking up the Pieces in "The Forgotten"|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/4423.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040208024105/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/4423.html|archivedate=February 8, 2004|date=February 6, 2004|publisher=Star Trek.com|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roddenberry stored a large volume of work on [[floppy disk]]s during the 1970s and early 1980s. Following his death, there remained several boxes of these disks that were unreadable by the computers of that time as they were formatted to be run on the [[CP/M]] [[operating system]] as well as custom built computers. Roddenberry owned two of those computers, one of which was sold in an estate sale following his death, and the other was non-operational. [[DriveSavers]] were contracted by Rod Roddenberry to restore the information on the disks in 2012, and while a few were compatible with [[MS-DOS]], the majority required the company to reverse engineer the format in order to read the disks. In early 2016, it was announced that the restoration efforts had been successful and between two and three megabytes had been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mah Ung|first1=Gordon|title=How Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry’s words were freed from old floppy disks|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3018315/storage/star-trek-creators-lost-words-recovered-from-old-floppies.html|publisher=PC World|accessdate=January 9, 2016|date=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous television series==
''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' was already in development when Roddenberry died, but the idea was not fully formed at the time and he was unable to sign off on the project. Berman said that: "He was quite ill, and I never got a chance to tell him what the ideas were, what they were about. But I definitely discussed things with him enough to know that he trusted me and had given me his blessings." The series began filming less than a year after Roddenberry's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cerone|first1=Daniel|title='Trek' Rolls on Without Roddenberry|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4148503.html|accessdate=March 22, 2015|work=Chicago Sun-Times|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=January 2, 1993|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berman continued to lead ''Star Trek'' through ''Deep Space Nine'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', but said that though his vision did not entirely align with Roddenberry's, he respected his mentor's views. Berman said: "I don't believe the 24th century is going to be like Gene Roddenberry believed it to be, that people will be free from poverty and greed. But if you're going to write and produce for ''Star Trek'', you've got to buy into that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cerone|first1=Daniel Howard|title=Berman in Firm Control of Starfleet Command|accessdate=March 22, 2015|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4258063.html|issue=Chicago Sun-Times|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=November 18, 1994|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1996, [[Majel Barrett|Majel Barrett-Roddenberry]] uncovered scripts, and a five-year plan by Roddenberry dating from 1977, for a series called ''Battleground Earth''. Roddenberry had planned to create a pilot for the series for 20th Century Fox Television, but this was postponed due to work on the resurgent ''Star Trek''. The project was sent to distributors by the [[Creative Artists Agency]], and it was picked up by [[Tribune Entertainment]] who set the budget at over $1 million per episode. Tribune's president Dick Askin said that due to interest already received from European channels because of the Roddenberry affiliation, the series had the possibility of becoming a global franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|title=Tribune stakes out 'Battleground Earth:' Roddenberry project for first-run is budgeted at $1 million per episode|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18640316.html|accessdate=March 22, 2015|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=September 2, 1996|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was renamed ''[[Earth: Final Conflict]]'' before launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roddenberry's Wife Picks up the Banner|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-68549963.html|accessdate=March 22, 2015|work=Rocky Mountain News|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=January 18, 1998|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While production was underway on ''Earth: Final Conflict'', Barrett discussed the volume of material in Roddenberry's archive with Askin. She asked his team to go through the archive to determine if there were any other source materials for possible television series. She said of the archive: "Gene was so prolific about writing. When he would get going on something and if, say, it didn't pass with a studio or a network, he would put it away or just throw it in the waste basket. I don't know if I was psychic or what, but I kept a lot of it."&lt;ref name=androarchive&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schlosser|first1=Joe|title=Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-59425159.html|accessdate=March 22, 2015|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=January 17, 2000|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribune team found two potential series in the archive, ''Genesis'' and ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]''. In late 1999, they green-lit ''Andromeda'' for release in broadcast syndication; it sold to 85% of the United States and launched in autumn of 2000. ''Star Trek'' fan [[Kevin Sorbo]] was signed as the lead for the series, and helped convince studio executives to select it over ''Genesis''. He became one of the executive producers of the series alongside Majel Barrett-Roddenberry, [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]], and Eric Gold. A pilot for ''Genesis'' was filmed, and was retained for possible future expansion.&lt;ref name=androarchive/&gt; After an initial order for two seasons, [[List of Andromeda episodes|110 episodes]] were ultimately aired over five seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grego|first1=Melissa|title='Andromeda' sets 2 more|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83030578.html|accessdate=March 22, 2015|work=Variety|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=January 21, 2002|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grego|first1=Melissa|title=Sci Fi Channel has picked up the final season of Tribune's Andromeda as an original series|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-112645693.html|accessdate=April 15, 2015|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=January 19, 2004|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mercantilism''' is a national economic policy that is designed to maximize the exports of a nation. Mercantilism was dominant in modernized parts of Europe from the 16th to the 18th centuries&lt;ref&gt;"Mercantilism," Laura LaHaye ''[[The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics]]'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; before falling into decline, although some commentators argue&lt;ref name="Samuelson 2007"&gt;{{Harvnb|Samuelson|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that it is still practiced in the economies of industrializing countries in the form of [[economic interventionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mises.org/library/mercantilism-lesson-our-times|title=Mercantilism: A Lesson for Our Times? {{!}} Murray N. Rothbard|last=kanopiadmin|date=2017-02-15|work=Mises Institute|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It promotes government regulation of a nation's economy for the purpose of augmenting state power at the expense of rival national powers. Mercantilism includes a national [[economic policy]] aimed at accumulating [[Foreign-exchange reserves|monetary reserves]] through a positive [[balance of trade]], especially of [[finished goods]]. Historically, such policies frequently led to war and also motivated [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson et al. ''History of domestic and foreign commerce of the United States'' p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercantilist theory varies in sophistication from one writer to another and has evolved over time. High [[tariff]]s, especially on manufactured goods, were an almost universal feature of mercantilist policy.&lt;ref name="John J. McCusker 2001"&gt;John J. McCusker, ''Mercantilism and the Economic History of the Early Modern Atlantic World'' (Cambridge UP, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; These policies aim to reduce a possible [[current account]] deficit or reach a [[current account]] surplus.

With the efforts of supranational organizations such as the [[World Trade Organization]] to reduce tariffs globally, [[non-tariff barriers to trade]] have assumed a greater importance in [[neomercantilism]].

==History==
Mercantilism was the dominant school of economic thought in Europe throughout the late [[Renaissance]] and [[early modern period]] (from the 15th to the 18th century). Mercantilism encouraged the many intra-European wars of the period and was arguably responsible for European expansion and [[imperialism]]—both in Europe and throughout the rest of the world—until the 19th century or early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Evidence of mercantilistic practices appeared in early modern [[Venice]], [[Genoa]], and [[Pisa]] regarding control of the Mediterranean trade of [[bullion]]. However, as a codified school of economic theories, mercantilism's real birth was marked by the [[empiricism]] of the [[Renaissance]], which first began to quantify large-scale trade accurately.&lt;ref name="John J. McCusker 2001"/&gt;

Mercantilism in its simplest form is [[bullionism]], yet mercantilist writers have emphasized the circulation of money and reject hoarding. Their emphasis on monetary metals accords with current ideas regarding the money supply, such as the stimulative effect of a [[stimulus (economics)|growing money supply]]. [[Fiat money]] and [[floating exchange rate]]s have since rendered [[Hard money (policy)|specie]] concerns irrelevant. In time, the heavy emphasis on money was supplanted by [[industrial policy]], accompanied by a shift in focus from the capacity to carry on wars to promoting general prosperity. Mature neomercantilist theory recommends selective high tariffs for [[infant industry|"infant" industries]] or the promotion of the mutual growth of countries through [[economics#Specialization|national industrial specialization]].{{citation needed|reason=These just seem like generic protectionist arguments, where is the evidence they are specifically "neomercantilist"?|date=January 2014}}

England began the first large-scale and integrative approach to mercantilism during the [[Elizabethan Era]] (1558–1603). An early statement on national balance of trade appeared in ''Discourse of the Common Weal of this Realm of England'', 1549: "We must always take heed that we buy no more from strangers than we sell them, for so should we impoverish ourselves and enrich them."&lt;ref&gt;Now attributed to [[Thomas Smith (diplomat)|Sir Thomas Smith]]; quoted in {{Harvtxt|Braudel|1979}}, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The period featured various but often disjointed efforts by the court of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] to develop a naval and merchant fleet capable of challenging the Spanish stranglehold on trade and of expanding the growth of bullion at home. Queen Elizabeth promoted the [[Trade and Navigation Acts]] in Parliament and issued orders to her navy for the protection and promotion of English shipping. A systematic and coherent explanation of balance of trade was made public through [[Thomas Mun]]'s argument ''England's Treasure by Forraign Trade, or the Balance of our Forraign Trade is The Rule of Our Treasure.'' It was written in the 1620s and published in 1664.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=David Onnekink|author2=Gijs Rommelse|title=Ideology and Foreign Policy in Early Modern Europe (1650–1750)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1QdbzdTimsC&amp;pg=PA257|year= 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|page=257 |isbn=9781409419143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These efforts organized national resources sufficiently in the defense of England against the far larger and more powerful [[Spanish Empire]], and in turn paved the foundation for establishing a global empire in the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The authors noted most for establishing the English mercantilist system include [[Gerard de Malynes]] and [[Thomas Mun]], who first articulated the Elizabethan system, which in turn was then developed further by [[Josiah Child]]. Numerous French authors helped cement French policy around mercantilism in the 17th century. This [[French mercantilism]] was best articulated by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] (in office, 1665–1683), though policy liberalized greatly under [[Napoleon]].

Many nations applied the theory, notably France, which was the most important state economically in Europe at the time. [[King Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] followed the guidance of [[Jean Baptiste Colbert]], his controller general of finances (1665–1683). It was determined{{by whom|date=July 2017}} that the state should rule in the economic realm as it did in the diplomatic, and that the interests of the state as identified by the king were superior to those of merchants and of everyone else. The goal of mercantilist economic policies was to build up the state, especially in an age of incessant warfare, and the state should look for ways to strengthen the economy and to weaken foreign adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;
Jerome Blum et al. '' The European World: A history'' (1970) p 279.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, academic belief in mercantilism began to fade in the late 18th century, especially in Britain, in light of the arguments of [[Adam Smith]] and the [[classical economics|classical economists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Humphrey |first1=Thomas M. |title=Insights From Doctrinal History. MERCANTILISTS. CLASSICALS |url=https://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/annual_report/1998/pdf/article.pdf |website=Richmond Federal Reserve |accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] by [[Robert Peel]] symbolized the emergence of [[free trade]] as an alternative system.

==Theory==
Most of the European economists who wrote between 1500 and 1750 are today generally considered mercantilists; this term was initially used solely by critics, such as Mirabeau and Smith, but was quickly adopted by historians. Originally the standard English term was "mercantile system". The word "mercantilism" was introduced into English from [[German language|German]] in the early 19th century.

The bulk of what is commonly called "mercantilist literature" appeared in the 1620s in Great Britain.&lt;ref name="Magnusson 2003 46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2003|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith saw the English merchant [[Thomas Mun]] (1571–1641) as a major creator of the mercantile system, especially in his posthumously published ''Treasure by Foreign Trade'' (1664), which Smith considered the archetype or manifesto of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2003|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the last major mercantilist work was [[James Denham-Steuart|James Steuart]]'s ''Principles of Political Economy'', published in 1767.&lt;ref name="Magnusson 2003 46"/&gt;

Mercantilist literature also extended beyond England. Italy and France produced noted writers of mercantilist themes, including Italy's [[Giovanni Botero]] (1544–1617) and [[Antonio Serra]] (1580–?) and, in France, [[Jean Bodin]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]]. Themes also existed in writers from the German historical school from List, as well as followers of the American system and British free-trade imperialism, thus stretching the system into the 19th century. However, many British writers, including Mun and [[Edward Misselden|Misselden]], were merchants, while many of the writers from other countries were public officials. Beyond mercantilism as a way of understanding the wealth and power of nations, Mun and Misselden are noted for their viewpoints on a wide range of economic matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2003|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian lawyer and scholar [[Philipp Wilhelm von Hornick]], one of the pioneers of [[Cameralism]], detailed a nine-point program of what he deemed effective national economy in his ''Austria Over All, If She Only Will'' of 1684, which comprehensively sums up the tenets of mercantilism:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ekelund|Hébert|1997|pp=40–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* That every little bit of a country's soil be utilized for agriculture, mining or manufacturing.
* That all raw materials found in a country be used in domestic manufacture, since finished goods have a higher value than raw materials.
* That a large, working population be encouraged.
* That all exports of gold and silver be prohibited and all domestic money be kept in circulation.
* That all imports of foreign goods be discouraged as much as possible.
* That where certain imports are indispensable they be obtained at first hand, in exchange for other domestic goods instead of gold and silver.
* That as much as possible, imports be confined to raw materials that can be finished [in the home country].
* That opportunities be constantly sought for selling a country's surplus manufactures to foreigners, so far as necessary, for gold and silver.
* That no importation be allowed if such goods are sufficiently and suitably supplied at home.

Other than Von Hornick, there were no mercantilist writers presenting an overarching scheme for the ideal economy, as [[Adam Smith]] would later do for classical economics. Rather, each mercantilist writer tended to focus on a single area of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landreth|Colander|2002|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Only later did non-mercantilist scholars integrate these "diverse" ideas into what they called mercantilism. Some scholars thus reject the idea of mercantilism completely, arguing that it gives "a false unity to disparate events". Smith saw the mercantile system as an enormous conspiracy by manufacturers and merchants against consumers, a view that has led some authors, especially Robert E. Ekelund and Robert D. Tollison, to call mercantilism "a [[rent-seeking]] society". To a certain extent, mercantilist doctrine itself made a general theory of economics impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ekelund|Tollison|1981|p=154}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mercantilists viewed the economic system as a [[Zero sum|zero-sum game]], in which any gain by one party required a loss by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ekelund|Tollison|1981|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, any system of policies that benefited one group would by definition harm the other, and there was no possibility of economics being used to maximize the commonwealth, or common good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landreth|Colander|2002|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mercantilists' writings were also generally created to rationalize particular practices rather than as investigations into the best policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|1997|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercantilist domestic policy was more fragmented than its trade policy. While Adam Smith portrayed mercantilism as supportive of strict controls over the economy, many mercantilists disagreed. The early modern era was one of [[letters patent]] and government-imposed [[monopolies]]; some mercantilists supported these, but others acknowledged the corruption and inefficiency of such systems. Many mercantilists also realized that the inevitable results of [[Import quota|quotas]] and price ceilings were [[Underground economy|black markets]]. One notion that mercantilists widely agreed upon was the need for [[economic oppression]] of the working population; laborers and farmers were to live at the "margins of [[subsistence]]". The goal was to maximize production, with no concern for [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Extra money, free time, and education for the [[lower classes]] were seen to inevitably lead to vice and laziness, and would result in harm to the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ekelund|Hébert|1975|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mercantilists saw a large population as a form of wealth that made possible the development of bigger [[Market (economics)|markets]] and [[army|armies]]. Opposite to mercantilism was the doctrine of [[physiocracy]], which predicted that mankind would outgrow its resources. The idea of mercantilism was to protect the markets as well as maintain agriculture and those who were dependent upon it.

==Policies==
Mercantilist ideas were the dominant economic ideology of all of Europe in the early modern period, and most states embraced it to a certain degree. Mercantilism was centred on England and France, and it was in these states that mercantilist policies were most often enacted.

The policies have included:
* High [[tariff]]s, especially on manufactured goods
* forbidding colonies to trade with other nations
* monopolizing markets with [[staple right|staple ports]]
* banning the export of gold and silver, even for payments
* forbidding trade to be carried in foreign ships, as per, for example, the [[Navigation Acts]]
* subsidies on exports
* promoting manufacturing and industry through research or direct subsidies
* limiting wages
* maximizing the use of domestic resources
* restricting domestic consumption through [[non-tariff barriers to trade]]

===France===
{{main|Colbertism}}
[[File:Jean-Baptiste Colbert.jpg|thumb|French finance minister and mercantilist [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] served for over 20 years.]]

Mercantilism arose in France in the early 16th century soon after the monarchy had become the dominant force in French politics. In 1539, an important decree banned the import of woolen goods from [[Spain]] and some parts of [[Flanders]]. The next year, a number of restrictions were imposed on the export of bullion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kellenbenz|1976|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the rest of the 16th century, further protectionist measures were introduced. The height of French mercantilism is closely associated with [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], finance minister for 22 years in the 17th century, to the extent that French mercantilism is sometimes called [[Colbertism]]. Under Colbert, the French government became deeply involved in the economy in order to increase exports. Protectionist policies were enacted that limited imports and favored exports. Industries were organized into guilds and monopolies, and production was regulated by the state through a series of more than one thousand directives outlining how different products should be produced.&lt;ref name="E.N. Williams. pg. 177-83"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1999|pp=177–83}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To encourage industry, foreign artisans and craftsmen were imported. Colbert also worked to decrease internal barriers to trade, reducing internal tariffs and building an extensive network of roads and canals. Colbert's policies were quite successful, and France's industrial output and economy grew considerably during this period, as France became the dominant European power. He was less successful in turning France into a major trading power, and Britain and the Netherlands remained supreme in this field.&lt;ref name="E.N. Williams. pg. 177-83"/&gt;

===New France===
{{Main|Economic history of Canada}}
France imposed its mercantilist philosophy on its colonies in North America, especially [[New France]]. It sought to derive the maximum material benefit from the colony, for the homeland, with a minimum of imperial investment in the colony itself. The ideology was embodied in New France through the establishment under Royal Charter of a number of corporate trading monopolies including La Compagnie des Marchands, which operated from 1613 to 1621, and the Compagnie de Montmorency, from that date until 1627. It was in turn replaced by La [[Compagnie des Cent-Associés]], created in 1627 by King Louis XIII, and the Communauté des habitants in 1643. These were the first corporations to operate in what is now Canada.

===Great Britain===
{{Main|Economic history of the United Kingdom#The Age of Mercantilism}}
In England, mercantilism reached its peak during the [[Long Parliament]] government (1640–60). Mercantilist policies were also embraced throughout much of the [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] periods, with [[Robert Walpole]] being another major proponent. In Britain, government control over the domestic economy was far less extensive than on the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], limited by [[common law]] and the steadily increasing power of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hansen|2001|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Government-controlled monopolies were common, especially before the [[English Civil War]], but were often controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|1980|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De slag bij Terheide - The Battle of Schevening - August 10 1653 (Willem van de Velde I, 1657).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|The [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] were fought between the English and the Dutch for control over the seas and trade routes.]]

With respect to its colonies,  British mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants—and kept others out—through trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling, which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish, or Dutch. The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them.  Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nester|2000|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

British mercantilist writers were themselves divided on whether domestic controls were necessary. British mercantilism thus mainly took the form of efforts to control trade. A wide array of regulations were put in place to encourage exports and discourage imports. Tariffs were placed on imports and bounties given for exports, and the export of some raw materials was banned completely. The [[Trade and Navigation Acts|Navigation Acts]] expelled foreign merchants from England's domestic trade. The nation aggressively sought colonies and once under British control, regulations were imposed that allowed the colony to only produce raw materials and to only trade with Britain. This led to friction with the inhabitants of these colonies, and mercantilist policies (such as forbidding trade with other empires and controls over smuggling) were a major irritant leading to the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&amp;pg=PA204 ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (1948) pp. 204ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercantalism taught that trade was a zero-sum game, with one country's gain equivalent to a loss sustained by the trading partner. Overall, however, mercantilist policies had a positive impact on Britain helping turn it into the world's dominant trader and the global [[hegemon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffry A. Frieden et al. eds.|first=|title=International Political Economy: Perspectives on Global Power and Wealth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-eAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132|date= 2002|publisher=Routledge|pages=128ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; One domestic policy that had a lasting impact was the conversion of "waste lands" to agricultural use. Mercantilists believed that to maximize a nation's power, all land and resources had to be used to their [[highest and best use]], and this era thus saw projects like the draining of [[The Fens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|1963|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===
[[File:Triangle trade2.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Mercantilism helped create trade patterns such as the [[triangular trade]] in the North Atlantic, in which raw materials were imported to the metropolis and then processed and redistributed to other colonies.]]

The other nations of Europe also embraced mercantilism to varying degrees. The Netherlands, which had become the financial centre of Europe by being its most efficient trader, had little interest in seeing trade restricted and adopted few mercantilist policies. Mercantilism became prominent in Central Europe and Scandinavia after the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48), with [[Christina of Sweden]], [[Jacob Kettler|Jacob Kettler of Courland]], and [[Christian IV of Denmark]] being notable proponents.

The Habsburg [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s had long been interested in mercantilist policies, but the vast and decentralized nature of their empire made implementing such notions difficult. Some constituent states of the empire did embrace Mercantilism, most notably Prussia, which under [[Frederick the Great]] had perhaps the most rigidly controlled economy in Europe.

During the economic collapse of the 17th century, Spain had little coherent economic policy, but French mercantilist policies were imported by [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] with some success. [[Russia]] under [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] (Peter the Great) attempted to pursue mercantilism, but had little success because of Russia's lack of a large merchant class or an industrial base.

==Wars and imperialism==
Mercantilism was the economic version of warfare using economics as a tool for warfare by other means backed up by the state apparatus, and was well suited to an era of military warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spiegel|1991|pp=93–118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the level of world trade was viewed as fixed, it followed that the only way to increase a nation's trade was to take it from another. A number of wars, most notably the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] and the [[Franco-Dutch War]]s, can be linked directly to mercantilist theories. Most wars had other causes but they reinforced mercantilism by clearly defining the enemy, and justified damage to the enemy's economy.

Mercantilism fueled the [[imperialism]] of this era, as many nations expended significant effort to conquer new colonies that would be sources of gold (as in Mexico) or sugar (as in the West Indies), as well as becoming exclusive markets. European power spread around the globe, often under the aegis of companies with government-guaranteed monopolies in certain defined geographical regions, such as the [[Dutch East India Company]] or the British [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (operating in present-day Canada).

With the establishment of overseas [[colony|colonies]] by European powers early in the 17th century, mercantile theory gained a new and wider significance, in which its aim and ideal became both national and imperialistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Emory Richard Johnson et al.|title= History of domestic and foreign commerce of the United States|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m-lYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA35|year= 1915|publisher= Carnegie Institution of Washington|pages= 35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=July 2017}}

==Origins==
The term "mercantile system" was used by its foremost critic, [[Adam Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gauci|first1=Perry|title=Regulating the British Economy, 1660-1850|date=2011|publisher=Ashgate Pub.|location=Farnham|isbn=9780754697626|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] (1715–1789) had used "mercantilism" earlier.

Mercantilism functioned as the economic counterpart of the older version of [[political power]]: [[divine right of kings]] and [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/375578/mercantilism editors, Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars debate over why mercantilism dominated economic ideology for 250 years.&lt;ref name ="Ekelund1975p61"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ekelund|Hébert|1975|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One group, represented by [[Jacob Viner]], sees mercantilism as simply a straightforward, common-sense system whose [[formal fallacy|logical fallacies]] remained opaque to people at the time, as they simply lacked the required analytical tools.

The second school, supported by scholars such as [[Robert B. Ekelund]], portrays mercantilism not as a mistake, but rather as the best possible system for those who developed it. This school argues that [[rent-seeking]] merchants and governments developed and enforced mercantilist policies. Merchants benefited greatly from the enforced monopolies, bans on foreign competition, and poverty of the workers. Governments benefited from the high tariffs and payments from the merchants. Whereas later economic ideas were often developed by academics and philosophers, almost all mercantilist writers were merchants or government officials.&lt;ref name= "Niehans1990p19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Niehans|1990|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monetarism offers a third explanation for mercantilism. European trade exported bullion to pay for goods from Asia, thus reducing the money supply and putting downward pressure on prices and economic activity. The evidence for this hypothesis is the lack of inflation in the British economy until the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, when [[paper money]] came into vogue.

A fourth explanation lies in the increasing professionalisation and technification of the wars of the era, which turned the maintenance of adequate reserve funds (in the prospect of war) into a more and more expensive and eventually competitive business.

Mercantilism developed at a time of transition for the European economy. Isolated [[feudalism|feudal]] estates were being replaced by centralized [[nation-state]]s as the focus of power. Technological changes in shipping and the growth of urban centres led to a rapid increase in international trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landreth|Colander|2002|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mercantilism focused on how this trade could best aid the states. Another important change was the introduction of [[Double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry bookkeeping]] and modern accounting. This accounting made extremely clear the inflow and outflow of trade, contributing to the close scrutiny given to the balance of trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|1963|p=10}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, the impact of the discovery of America cannot be ignored.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} New markets and new mines propelled foreign trade to previously inconceivable volumes, resulting in "the great upward movement in prices" and an increase in "the volume of merchant activity itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|1987|pp=33–34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to mercantilism, the most important economic work done in Europe was by the medieval [[scholasticism|scholastic]] theorists. The goal of these thinkers was to find an economic system compatible with Christian doctrines of piety and justice. They focused mainly on [[microeconomics]] and on local exchanges between individuals. Mercantilism was closely aligned with the other theories and ideas that began to replace the medieval worldview. This period saw the adoption of the very [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavellian]] [[realpolitik]] and the primacy of the ''[[National interest|raison d'état]]'' in [[international relations]]. The mercantilist idea of all trade as a zero-sum game, in which each side was trying to best the other in a ruthless competition, was integrated into the works of [[Thomas Hobbes]]. This dark view of human nature also fit well with the [[Puritan]] view of the world, and some of the most stridently mercantilist legislation, such as the [[Navigation Acts|Navigation Ordinance]] of 1651, was enacted by the government of [[Oliver Cromwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landreth|Colander|2002|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]]'s work in 17th-century France came to exemplify classical mercantilism. In the English-speaking world its ideas were criticized by [[Adam Smith]] with the publication of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' in 1776 and later by [[David Ricardo]] with his explanation of [[comparative advantage]]. Mercantilism was rejected by Britain and France by the mid-19th century. The British Empire embraced [[free-trade|free trade]] and used its power as the financial centre of the world to promote the same. The Guyanese historian [[Walter Rodney]] describes mercantilism as the period of the worldwide development of European commerce, which began in the 15th century with the voyages of Portuguese and Spanish explorers to Africa, Asia, and the New World.

==Criticisms==
[[Adam Smith]] and [[David Hume]] were the founding fathers of anti-mercantilist thought. A number of scholars found important flaws with mercantilism long before Smith developed an ideology that could fully replace it. Critics like Hume, [[Dudley North (economist)|Dudley North]] and [[John Locke]] undermined much of mercantilism and it steadily lost favor during the 18th century.

In 1690, Locke argued that prices vary in proportion to the quantity of money. Locke's ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise]]'' also points towards the heart of the anti-mercantilist critique: that the wealth of the world is not fixed, but is created by human labor (represented embryonically by Locke's [[labor theory of value]]). Mercantilists failed to understand the notions of [[absolute advantage]] and [[comparative advantage]] (although this idea was only fully fleshed out in 1817 by [[David Ricardo]]) and the benefits of trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spiegel|1991}}, ch. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, imagine that Portugal was a more efficient producer of wine than England, yet in England cloth could be produced more efficiently than it could in Portugal. Thus if Portugal specialized in wine and England in cloth, ''both'' states would end up ''better off'' if they traded. This is an example of the reciprocal benefits of trade (whether due to [[comparative advantage|comparative]] or [[absolute advantage]]). In modern economic theory, trade is ''not'' a zero-sum game of cutthroat competition, because both sides can benefit from it.

[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Much of [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' is an attack on mercantilism.]]

Hume famously noted the impossibility of the mercantilists' goal of a constant positive balance of trade.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} As bullion flowed into one country, the supply would increase, and the value of bullion in that state would steadily decline relative to other goods. Conversely, in the state exporting bullion, its value would slowly rise. Eventually it would no longer be cost-effective to export goods from the high-price country to the low-price country, and the balance of trade would reverse. Mercantilists fundamentally misunderstood this, long arguing that an increase in the money supply simply meant that everyone gets richer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ekelund|Hébert|1975|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance placed on bullion was also a central target, even if many mercantilists had themselves begun to de-emphasize the importance of gold and silver. Adam Smith noted that at the core of the mercantile system was the "popular folly of confusing wealth with money", that bullion was just the same as any other commodity, and that there was no reason to give it special treatment.&lt;ref name="Magnusson 2003 46"/&gt; More recently, scholars have discounted the accuracy of this critique. They believe Mun and Misselden were not making this mistake in the 1620s, and point to their followers Josiah Child and [[Charles Davenant]], who in 1699 wrote, "Gold and Silver are indeed the Measure of Trade, but that the Spring and Original of it, in all nations is the Natural or Artificial Product of the Country; that is to say, what this Land or what this Labour and Industry Produces."&lt;ref&gt;Referenced to Davenant, 1771 [1699], p. 171, in {{Harvnb|Magnusson|2003|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The critique that mercantilism was a form of rent seeking has also seen criticism, as scholars such [[Jacob Viner]] in the 1930s pointed out that merchant mercantilists such as Mun understood that they would not gain by higher prices for English wares abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2003|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first school to completely reject mercantilism was the physiocrats, who developed their theories in France. Their theories also had several important problems, and the replacement of mercantilism did not come until Adam Smith published ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' in 1776. This book outlines the basics of what is today known as [[classical economics]]. Smith spent a considerable portion of the book rebutting the arguments of the mercantilists, though often these are simplified or exaggerated versions of mercantilist thought.&lt;ref name="Niehans1990p19"/&gt;

Scholars are also divided over the cause of mercantilism's end. Those who believe the theory was simply an error hold that its replacement was inevitable as soon as Smith's more accurate ideas were unveiled. Those who feel that mercantilism amounted to rent seeking hold that it ended only when major power shifts occurred. In Britain, mercantilism faded as the Parliament gained the monarch's power to grant monopolies. While the wealthy capitalists who controlled the House of Commons benefited from these monopolies, Parliament found it difficult to implement them because of the high cost of [[group decision making]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ekelund|Tollison|1981|p=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercantilist regulations were steadily removed over the course of the 18th century in Britain, and during the 19th century the British government fully embraced free trade and Smith's [[laissez-faire]] economics. On the continent, the process was somewhat different. In France, economic control remained in the hands of the royal family, and mercantilism continued until the [[French Revolution]]. In Germany mercantilism remained an important ideology in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when the [[historical school of economics]] was paramount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|1963|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Adam Smith rejected the mercantilist focus on production, arguing that consumption was paramount to production. He added that mercantilism was popular among merchants because it was what is now called [[rent seeking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brezis|2003}}, vol. 2, p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[John Maynard Keynes]] argued that encouraging production was just as important as encouraging consumption, and he favoured the "new mercantilism". Keynes also noted that in the early modern period the focus on the bullion supplies was reasonable. In an era before [[paper money]], an increase in bullion was one of the few ways to increase the [[money supply]]. Keynes said mercantilist policies generally improved both domestic and foreign investment—domestic because the policies lowered the domestic rate of interest, and investment by foreigners by tending to create a favorable balance of trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|1950|p=321}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynes and other economists of the 20th century also realized that the balance of payments is an important concern. Keynes also supported [[government intervention]] in the economy as necessity, as did mercantilism.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Markwell|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2010}}, the word "mercantilism" remains a pejorative term, often used to attack various forms of [[protectionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|1963|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The similarities between Keynesianism (and its successor ideas) and mercantilism have sometimes led critics to call them [[neo-mercantilism]]. [[Paul Samuelson]], writing within a Keynesian framework, wrote of mercantilism, "With employment less than full and Net National Product suboptimal, all the debunked mercantilist arguments turn out to be valid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Samuelson|1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other systems that copy several mercantilist policies, such as [[Economy of Japan|Japan's economic system]], are also sometimes called neo-mercantilist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Walters|Blake|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In an essay appearing in the 14 May 2007 issue of ''[[Newsweek]]'', business columnist [[Robert J. Samuelson]] wrote that [[China]] was pursuing an essentially neo-mercantilist trade policy that threatened to undermine the post–[[World War II]] international economic structure.&lt;ref name="Samuelson 2007"/&gt;

[[Murray Rothbard]], representing the [[Austrian School]] of economics, describes it this way:

{{quote|Mercantilism, which reached its height in the Europe of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, was a system of [[statism]] which employed economic fallacy to build up a structure of imperial state power, as well as special subsidy and monopolistic privilege to individuals or groups favored by the state. Thus, mercantilism held exports should be encouraged by the government and imports discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rothbard|1997|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In specific instances, protectionist mercantilist policies also had an important and positive impact on the state that enacted them. Adam Smith, for instance, praised the [[Navigation Acts]], as they greatly expanded the British merchant fleet and played a central role in turning Britain into the world's naval and economic superpower from the 18th century onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hansen|2001|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some economists thus feel that protecting [[infant industry argument|infant industries]], while causing short-term harm, can be beneficial in the long term.

==Neomercantilism==
{{main|Neomercantilism}}
Neomercantilism is a 20th-century economic policy that uses the ideas and methods of [[neoclassical economics]]. The new mercantilism has different goals and focuses on more rapid economic growth based on advanced technology. It promotes such policies as substitution state taxation, subsidies, expenditures, and general regulatory powers for tariffs and quotas, and protection through the formation of supranational trading blocs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1974|pp=1–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''metaconstitution''' is a set of pre-constitutional rules.&lt;ref&gt;These rules are often referred to as "metarules". The metarules are developed from axioms appropriate to the time period. Thus, what is actually constructed can be variable.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in lieu of a formalized [[constitution]] and consists of accepted axiomatic policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Alexander |first= Larry|title=  Constitutionalism:Philosophical Foundations| pages= 2–3| isbn=0-521-79999-6| publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution is similar to or developed from this. A metaconstitution is also less binding, and can be used to a less rigid form of government. To many nations, the metaconstitution provides an "exit-option", where they may variate from the written document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aaken |first= Anne Van|author2=Christian List |author3=Christoph Lutege |title=Deliberation and Decision|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.| isbn=0-7546-2358-0| page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; A metaconstitution, unlike formal constitutions, never needs to be written. Its creation results from the morality and judgment of the people. To be formulated, the people must be generally opposed to anarchy and must desire some form of governing force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=O'Mahony|first=Paul|title= Criminal Justice in Ireland| publisher=Institute of Public Administration| isbn=1-902448-71-5| page= 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although vague in concept, the metaconstitution almost always creates the basic roles of leader v. follower. The purpose of the document, however, prevents the placement of total power on the leader. The populace is trusted to self-govern except in severe cases. Such theory does not differ much from [[salutary neglect]] or [[laissez faire]].

==Historical concept==
Many prominent political philosophers have discoursed on the subject of metaconstitutionalism, though not directly. Some address the topic as a looser constitution in which the government's singular duty is to protect the people and vice versa. Per [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]: {{cquote|If it be admitted that a man possessing absolute power may misuse that power . . . . why should not a majority be liable to the same reproach? Men do not change their characters by uniting with each other. . . . For myself, when I feel the hand of power lie heavy on my brow, I care but little to know who oppresses me; and I am not the more disposed to pass beneath the yoke because it is held out to me by the arms of a million of men.|25px|25px|Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859), Democracy in America, New York: New American Library, 1956, pp. 114, 149}}

The concept of metaconstitutionalism received light during the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], as a possible replacement to the [[Articles of Confederation]]. Per the Federalist, Number 51: {{cquote|In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself . A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.|25px|25px|Federalist, Number 51}}

==Metaconstitutions==

{{Empty section|date=March 2013}}

==Criticisms==
A metaconstitution is constructed to provide a looser equivalent for government. However, a metaconstitutionalistic society is more likely to suffer from domestic disorder.&lt;ref name= "disorder"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kromkowski|first=Charles Aloysius|title=Recreating the American Republic|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-80848-0|page=xxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the government cannot wield any power to control the outbreak. Lack of trade and corruption are also major difficulties for a metaconstitution. Again, the governments legal inability to enforce powerful law prevents it from containing situations.&lt;ref name= "disorder" /&gt; In this usage of "metaconstitution", it can also mean a constitution with a nearly non-existent [[executive branch]].

'''Northern soul''' is a music and dance movement that emerged in [[Northern England]] in the late 1960s from the British [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] scene, based on a particular style of [[African American music|black American]] [[soul music]], especially from the mid-1960s, with a heavy beat and fast tempo (100 [[Tempo|bpm]] and above).&lt;ref&gt;David Nowell ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=M66-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT79 The Story of Northern Soul, p. 79]'' Anova Books, 1999, {{ISBN|1907554726}}, accessed 11 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://louderthanwar.com/the-current-northern-soul-scene-is-it-just-nostalgia-or-a-vibrant-world/|title=The Current Northern Soul scene: Is it just nostalgia?|last=Norcliffe|first=Josh|date=28 February 2014|work=|newspaper=[[Louder Than War (website)|Louder Than War]]|access-date=17 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern soul movement generally eschews Motown or Motown-influenced music that has had significant mainstream commercial success. The recordings most prized by enthusiasts of the genre are usually by lesser-known artists, released only in limited numbers, often by small regional American labels such as [[Ric-Tic Records|Ric-Tic]] and AMG Records (Cincinnati), [[Golden World Records]] (Detroit), Mirwood (Los Angeles) and Shout and [[Okeh Records|Okeh]] (New York/Chicago).

Northern soul is associated with particular dance styles and fashions that grew out of the underground rhythm &amp; soul scene of the late 1960s at venues such as the [[Twisted Wheel]] in [[Manchester]]. This scene and the associated dances and fashions quickly spread to other UK dancehalls and nightclubs like the [[Chateau Impney]] ([[Droitwich]]), Catacombs ([[Wolverhampton]]), the Highland Rooms at [[Blackpool Mecca]], [[Golden Torch]] ([[Stoke-on-Trent]]) and [[Wigan Casino]].

As the favoured beat became more uptempo and frantic in the early 1970s, northern soul dancing became more athletic, somewhat resembling the later dance styles of [[disco]] and [[break dancing]]. Featuring spins, flips, karate kicks and backdrops, club dancing styles were often inspired by the stage performances of touring American soul acts such as [[Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials]] and [[Jackie Wilson]].

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, popular northern soul records generally dated from the mid-1960s. This meant that the movement was sustained (and "new" recordings added to playlists) by prominent DJs discovering rare and previously overlooked records. Later on, certain clubs and DJs began to move away from the 1960s Motown sound and began to play newer releases with a more contemporary sound.

==History==
The phrase "Northern soul" emanated from the record shop Soul City in [[Covent Garden]], London, which was run by journalist [[Dave Godin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Rushton]], ''Northern Soul Stories'', Chapter 1, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; It was first publicly used in Godin's weekly column in ''[[Blues &amp; Soul]]'' magazine in June 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dave Godin]]. "The Up-North Soul Groove", ''Blues &amp; Soul'' magazine, June 1970&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2002 interview with [[Chris Hunt]] of ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine, Godin said he had first come up with the term in 1968, to help employees at Soul City differentiate the more modern funkier sounds from the smoother, Motown-influenced soul of a few years earlier. With contemporary black music evolving into what would eventually become known as [[funk]], the die-hard soul lovers of Northern England still preferred the mid-1960s era of Motown-sounding black American dance music. Godin referred to the latter's requests as "Northern Soul":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I had started to notice that northern [[Association football|football]] fans who were in [[London]] to follow their team were coming into the store to buy records, but they weren't interested in the latest developments in the black American chart. I devised the name as a shorthand sales term. It was just to say 'if you've got customers from the north, don't waste time playing them records currently in the U.S. black chart, just play them what they like - 'Northern Soul'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chrishunt.biz/features05.html |title=Chris Hunt &amp;#124; Wigan Casino |publisher=Chrishunt.biz |date=23 September 1973 |accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The venue most commonly associated with the early development of the northern soul scene was the Twisted Wheel in Manchester. The club began in the early 1950s as a [[beatnik]] coffee bar called The Left Wing, but in early 1963, the run-down premises were leased by two Manchester businessmen (Ivor and Phil Abadi) and turned into a music venue.&lt;ref&gt;Haslam, Dave, ''Manchester, England''. 4th Estate. 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the Twisted Wheel mainly hosted live music on the weekends and ''Disc Only'' nights during the week. Starting in September 1963, the Abadi brothers promoted all-night parties at the venue on Saturday nights, with a mixture of live and recorded music. DJ Roger Eagle, a collector of imported American soul, [[jazz]] and [[rhythm and blues]], was booked around this time, and the club's reputation as a place to hear and dance to the latest American R&amp;B music began to grow. However, other towns and cities across Britain had similar enthusiasts around this time who would tune into pirate radio broadcasts, and record shops would help bring the U.S. soul sound into Britain. Pubs such as the Eagle in [[Birmingham]] were frequented by young British soul singers such as [[Steve Winwood]] and [[Robert Plant]], who both released songs of similar style to the early U.S. soul sounds, and the emphasis in [[the Midlands]] was more on live soul bands than discos.

Throughout the mid-1960s, the Twisted Wheel became the focus of Manchester’s emerging mod scene, with a music policy that reflected Eagle’s eclectic tastes in soul and jazz, and featuring live performances by British [[beat music]]ians and American R&amp;B stars. Gradually, the music policy became less eclectic and shifted heavily towards fast-paced soul, in response to the demands of the growing crowds of amphetamine-fuelled dancers who flocked to the all-nighters. Dismayed at the change in music policy and the frequent drug raids by the police, Eagle quit the club in 1966 taking  with him his vast collection of UK and imported vinyl.

[[File:TwistedWheelBadge.gif|left|thumb|Commemorative sew-on patch similar to those worn by Twisted Wheel members.]]
By 1968 the reputation of the Twisted Wheel and the type of music being played there had grown nationwide and soul fans were travelling from all over the United Kingdom to attend the Saturday all-nighters. Until his departure in 1968, resident 'All Niter' DJ Bob Dee compiled and supervised &lt;ref&gt;David Nowell, ''Too Darn Soulful: The Story of Northern Soul'' page 35&lt;/ref&gt; the playlist, utilising the newly developed [[slip-cueing]] technique to spin the vinyl. Rarer, more up-tempo imported records were added to the playlist in 1969 by the new younger DJ's like Brian "45"Phillips up until the club's eventual closure in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;''Bolton Evening News'' "Marvellous Days and Memories" Saturday 15 March 2003 page 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Manchester Evening News'' "Where is Bobby Now?" Saturday 3 January 2004 page 20&lt;/ref&gt; After attending one of the venue's all-nighters in November 1970, Godin wrote: "...it is without doubt the highest and finest I have seen outside of the USA... never thought I'd live to see the day where people could so relate the rhythmic content of Soul music to bodily movement to such a skilled degree!"&lt;ref name="soul-source.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.soul-source.co.uk/articles/soul-articles/the-twisted-wheel-blues-and-soul-by-dave-godin-r1926/ The Twisted Wheel - Blues and Soul - by Dave Godin - Soul Features - Soul Source&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The venue’s owners had successfully filled the vacancy left by Eagle with a growing roster of specialist soul DJs including Brian Rae, Paul Davis and Alan 'Ollie' Ollerton.

The Twisted Wheel gained a reputation as a drug haven, and under pressure from the police and other authorities, the club closed in January 1971. However, by the late 1960s, the popularity of the music and lifestyle associated with the club had spread further across the North and Midlands of England, and a number of new venues had begun to host soul all-nighters. These included the [[King Mojo]] in [[Sheffield]], the Catacombs in [[Wolverhampton]], Room at the Top in [[Wigan]], Va Va's in [[Bolton]] &amp; Shades ([[Northampton]]) the top Northern Soul venue further south in England.

===1970s===
[[File:TheTorchBadge.gif|right|thumb|Commemorative sew-on patch similar to those worn by Golden Torch members.]]
Northern soul reached the peak of its popularity in the mid to late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;by [[Bill Brewster (DJ)|Bill Brewster]] and Frank Broughton. ''Last Night a DJ Saved My Life'', Chapter four, Northern Soul. Section: "Soul Wars: Wigan Casino vs Blackpool Mecca", page 98&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, there were soul clubs in virtually every major town in the Midlands and the North of England.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Stickings, Reg. ''Searching For Soul''&lt;/ref&gt; The three venues regarded as the most important in this decade were the [[Golden Torch]] in [[Tunstall, Staffordshire|Tunstall]], Stoke-on-Trent (1971 to 1972), [[Blackpool Mecca]] (1971 to 1979) and [[Wigan Casino]] (1973 to 1981).

Although Wigan Casino is now the most well known, the best attended Northern soul all-night venue at the beginning of the decade was actually the Golden Torch, where regular Friday night soul "all-nighters" began during the latter months of 1970. Chris Burton, the owner, stated that by 1972, the club had a membership of 12,500, and had hosted 62,000 separate customer visits.&lt;ref&gt;Haslam, Dave. ''Adventures on the Wheels of Steel: The Rise of the Superstar DJs'', Chapter six, "Leaving the Go-Go Girls at Home", page 170&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its popularity, the club closed down due to licensing problems in March 1972 and attention switched to soul nights at Blackpool Mecca's Highland Room, which had started hosting rare soul nights a few months earlier.

In 1972, [[The Four Seasons (band)|The Four Seasons]] released the song "[[The Night (Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons song)|The Night]]", from their May 1972 album ''"[[Chameleon (The Four Seasons album)|Chameleon]]"'', a [[disco]] song which appealed to the Northern soul scene,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=30456]&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result, it was successfully re-released in the UK in the spring of 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150404011042/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/14203/frankie-valli/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WiganCasinoBadge.gif|left|thumb|Commemorative sew-on patch similar to those designed by [[Russ Winstanley]] and sold at the Wigan Casino.]]
Wigan Casino began its weekly soul all-nighters in September 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Russ Winstanley and David Nowell. ''Soul Survivors: The Wigan Casino Story''. Chapter one, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Wigan Casino had a much larger capacity than many competing venues and ran its events from 2.00am until 8.00am. There was a regular roster of DJs, including the promoters Russ Winstanley and Richard Searling. By 1976, the club boasted a membership of 100,000 people, and in 1978, was voted the world's number one [[discotheque]] by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]]''.&lt;!-- no record of this ever happening has ever come to light though? It was never documented at the time either?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Brewster (DJ)|Bill Brewster]] and Frank Broughton. ''Last Night A DJ Saved My Life''. Chapter four, page 99, "Soul Wars: Wigan Casino versus Blackpool Mecca"&lt;/ref&gt; This was all going during the heyday of the [[Studio 54]] nightclub in [[New York City]]. By the late 1970s, the club had its own spin-off record label, Casino Classics.&lt;ref&gt;Russ Winstanley and David Nowell. ''Soul Survivors: The Wigan Casino Story''. Chapter seven, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, Wigan Casino was coming under criticism from many soul fans about selling out the format and playing 'anything that came along'. Contemporary black American soul was changing with the advent of [[funk]], [[disco]] and [[jazz-funk]], and the supply of recordings with the fast-paced Northern soul sound began to dwindle rapidly. As a result, Wigan Casino DJs resorted to playing any kind of record that matched the correct tempo.&lt;ref&gt;Ritson, Mike &amp; Russell, Stuart. ''The In Crowd: The Story of the Northern &amp; Rare Soul Scene'', Chapter twenty, page 273&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the club was subjected to heavy media coverage and began to attract many otherwise uninterested people of whom the soul purists did not approve.&lt;ref&gt;Haslam, Dave. ''Adventures on the Wheels of Steel: The Rise of the Superstar DJs'', Chapter six, "Leaving The Go-Go Girls At Home", page 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackpool Mecca was popular throughout the 1970s, although the venue never hosted all-nighters. The regular Saturday night events began at 8.00pm and finished at 2.00am, and initially, some dancers would begin their evenings at Blackpool Mecca and then transfer to Wigan Casino. In 1974, the music policy at Blackpool Mecca sharply diverged from Wigan Casino's, with the regular DJs [[Ian Levine]] and [[Colin Curtis (DJ)|Colin Curtis]] including newly released US soul in their sets. While the tempo was similar to the earlier [[Motown Records]]-style recordings, this shift in emphasis heralded a slightly different style of Northern soul dancing and dress styles at Blackpool Mecca and created a schism in the Northern soul movement between Wigan Casino's traditionalists and Blackpool Mecca's wider approach, which accepted the more contemporary sounds of [[Philly soul]], early disco and funk.

Other major Northern soul venues in the 1970s include the Catacombs in Wolverhampton, Va Va's in Bolton, the 'Talk of the North' all-nighters at the Pier and Winter Gardens in [[Cleethorpes]], Tiffany’s in [[Coalville]], Samantha’s in [[Sheffield]], [[Neil Rushton]]'s 'Heart of England' soul club all-dayers at [[The Ritz (Manchester)|the Ritz]] in Manchester and the [[Nottingham]] Palais.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raresoul.org.uk/hinckleysoulclub/default.asp |title=Hinckley Soul Club |publisher=Raresoul.org.uk |date=29 July 2014 |accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1970s progressed, the Northern soul scene expanded even further nationally. There was a notable scene in the east of England, Shades Northampton was one of the leading venues in this part of the country during the early 1970s until it closed it doors in 1975. Later came the all-nighters at the St. Ivo Centre in St. Ives, the Phoenix Soul club at the Wirrina Stadium in [[Peterborough]] and the Howard Mallett in [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Ritson, Mike &amp; Russell, Stuart. ''The In Crowd: The Story of the Northern &amp; Rare Soul Scene'', Chapter 19, page 263&lt;/ref&gt;  Other towns with notable Northern soul venues at this time included [[Kettering]], [[Coventry]], [[Bournemouth]], [[Southampton]] and [[Bristol]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===1980s and later===
When Wigan Casino closed in 1981, many believed that the Northern soul scene was on the verge of disintegrating. However, the 1970s [[mod revival]], the thriving [[scooterboy]] subculture and the [[acid jazz]] movement produced a new wave of fans. The popularity of the music was further bolstered in the 1980s by a wave of reissues and compilation albums from small British independent record labels. Many of these labels were set up by DJs and collectors who had been part of the original Northern soul scene. The 1980s — often dismissed as a low period for Northern soul by those who had left the scene in the 1970s —  featured almost 100 new venues in places as diverse as [[Bradford]], London, Peterborough, [[Leighton Buzzard]], [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]], Coventry and [[Leicester]]. Pre-eminent among the 1980s venues were [[Stafford]]'s Top of the World and [[London]]'s [[100 Club]].

Today there are regular Northern soul events in various parts of the United Kingdom, such as the Nightshift Club all-nighters at the [[Bisley, Surrey|Bisley]] Pavilion in [[Surrey]] and the [[Prestatyn]] Weekender in [[North Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Ritson, Mike. "Northern Exposure" column in ''Echoes'' magazine. March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In an August 2008 article in ''[[The Times]]'', broadcaster [[Terry Christian]] argued that Northern soul was undergoing a distinct revival in the late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article4613377.ece "The Return of Northern Soul"] Article by Terry Christian in ''[[The Times]]'', 27 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Christian cited the popularity of regular revivals of Twisted Wheel soul all-nighters at the original venue (in [[Whitworth Street]], Manchester) plus the Beat Boutique Northern soul all-nighters at the Ruby Lounge and [[MMUnion]] in Manchester. Many of those who ceased their involvement in the late 1970s have now returned to the scene and regularly participate in such events.&lt;ref&gt;Stickings, Reg, ''Searching for Soul''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Nowell, ''Too Darn Soulful: The Story of Northern Soul''. Chapter 12, page 319.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, [[Paul O'Grady]] has included a ''Northern Soul Triple'' in his weekly [[BBC Radio 2]] show. He plays three Northern soul hits, often at the request of his listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/paul-ogrady/song-suggestions |title=Radio 2 - Paul O'Grady - Contact Us |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern soul movement inspired the film ''[[Soulboy (film)|Soulboy]]'' (2010), directed by Shimmy Marcus, and at least one novel: ''Do I Love You?'' (2008) by [[Paul McDonald (writer)|Paul McDonald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/21/northern-soul-soulboy-film | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Paolo | last=Hewitt | title=SoulBoy might be set in 1974 but Northern soul fans are still out on the floor | date=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/fictionreviews/3560966/Saving-the-hapless-male.html |title=Saving the hapless male |publisher=Telegraph |date=20 September 2008 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cahir O'Doherty |url=http://www.irishcentral.com/saint_patricks_day/An-essential-reading-guide-for-St-Patricks-season-41096537.html |title=Books for St. Patrick's Day season |publisher=IrishCentral.com |date=14 March 2009 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, theatre director Fiona Laird wrote and directed ''Keeping the Faith'', a musical based on the Wigan Casino scene and featuring Northern soul music. It was staged at the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]]'s Webber Douglas Studio, with a revival at the same venue in September 2010.

The music of [[Yorkshire]] singer [[John Newman (singer)|John Newman]] has been described as 'Northern soul', including his No. 1 hit "[[Love Me Again (John Newman song)|Love Me Again]]". One version of the video for the song features stereotypical Northern soul dancing. Additionally, the track samples the famous soul drum break from [[James Brown]]'s "[[Funky Drummer]]", performed by [[Clyde Stubblefield]].

==Music, artists and records==
{{see also|Category:Northern soul musicians}}
[[File:GloriaJones45.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Photograph of the original release (left) and a re-issue copy (right) of [[Gloria Jones]]' ''[[Tainted Love]]'']]
In the book ''Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: the history of the DJ'', the authors describe Northern soul as "a genre built from failures", stating: "...Northern Soul was the music made by hundreds of singers and bands who were copying the Detroit sound of Motown pop. Most of the records were complete failures in their own time and place... but in Northern England from the end of the 1960s through to its heyday in the middle 1970s, were exhumed and exalted."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Brewster (DJ)|Bill Brewster]] and Frank Broughton. ''Last Night A DJ Saved My Life''. Chapter four, page 86, "A Genre Built From Failures"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music style===
The music style most associated with Northern soul is the heavy, [[Syncopation|syncopated]] beat and fast tempo of mid-1960s [[Motown Records]], which was usually combined with soulful vocals. These types of records, which suited the athletic dancing that was prevalent, became known on the scene as ''stompers''.&lt;ref&gt;Haslam, Dave, ''Manchester, England'', chapter six, p147&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples include Tony Clarke’s "Landslide" (popularised by [[Ian Levine]] at Blackpool Mecca)&lt;ref&gt;Sleeve notes written by Ian Levine accompanying the CD "Reachin’ For the Best: The Northern Soul of the Blackpool Mecca" on Sanctuary records&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gloria Jones]]’ "[[Tainted Love]]" (purchased by Richard Searling on a trip to the United States in 1973 and popularised at Va Va’s in Bolton, and later, Wigan Casino).&lt;ref&gt;Haslam, Dave, ''Manchester, England'', chapter six, p172&lt;/ref&gt; According to northern soul DJ Ady Croadsell, viewed retrospectively, the earliest recording to possess this style was the 1965 single "[[I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)]]" by the [[Four Tops]], although that record was never popular in the Northern soul scene because it was too mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Hewitt. ''The Soul Stylists''. p. 111, quote from Ady Croadsell&lt;/ref&gt;

Other related music styles also gained acceptance in the Northern soul scene. Slower, less-danceable soul records were often played, such as Barbara Mills' "Queen of Fools" (popular in 1972 at the Golden Torch)&lt;ref&gt;Sleeve notes written by Neil Rushton accompanying the LP ''Out on the Floor Tonight'' on Inferno Records&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mob’s "I Dig Everything About You".&lt;ref&gt;Sleeve notes written by Ian Levine accompanying the CD "Reachin’ For the Best: The Northern Soul of the Blackpool Mecca"&lt;/ref&gt; Every all-nighter at Wigan Casino ended with the playing of three well-known Northern soul songs with a particular ''going home'' theme. These came to be known as the "3 before 8" and were: "Time Will Pass You By" by [[Tobi Legend]], "Long After Tonight is Over" by [[Jimmy Radcliffe]] and "[[I'm on My Way (Dean Parrish song)|I'm on My Way]]" by [[Dean Parrish]].&lt;ref&gt;Sleeve notes accompanying the LP ''Casino Classics Chapter One'' on Casino Classics Records&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial pop songs that matched the up-tempo beat of the ''stompers'' were also played at some venues, including the [[Ron Grainer]] Orchestra’s instrumental "Theme From Joe 90" at Wigan Casino&lt;ref&gt;Russ Winstanley and David Nowell ''Soul Survivors: The Wigan Casino Story''. Chapter seven, page 109&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Just Brothers]]’ surf-guitar song "Sliced Tomatoes" at Blackpool Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;Sleeve notes written by Ian Levine accompanying the CD ''Reachin’ For the Best: The Northern Soul of the Blackpool Mecca''&lt;/ref&gt;

As the scene developed in the mid and late 1970s, the more contemporary and rhythmically sophisticated sounds of [[disco]] and [[Philly Soul]] became accepted at certain venues following its adoption at Blackpool Mecca. This style is typified musically by [[the O'Jays]]' "I Love Music" (UK No. 13, January 1976), which gained popularity before its commercial release at Blackpool Mecca in late 1975. The record that initially popularised this change is usually cited as [[the Carstairs]] "[[It Really Hurts Me Girl]]" (Red Coach), a record initially released late in 1973 on promotional copies - but quickly withdrawn due to lack of interest from American radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/0/24164508 | title=Northern Soul: 40 years of the sound of Wigan Casino | publisher=BBC Arts | accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Brewster (DJ)|Bill Brewster]] and Frank Broughton. ''Last Night a DJ Saved My Life'' Chapter four, page 106, "Fighting for the soul of soul"&lt;/ref&gt; The hostility towards any contemporary music style from Northern soul traditionalists at Wigan Casino led to the creation of the spin-off [[modern soul]] movement in the early 1980s.

===Rarity of Northern soul records===
{{see also|Rare groove}}
Some Northern soul records were so rare that only a handful of copies were known to exist, so specific DJs and clubs became associated with particular records that were almost exclusively in their own playlists. Keith Rylatt and Phil Scott wrote: "As venues such as the Twisted Wheel evolved into Northern soul clubs in the late 1960s and the dancers increasingly demanded newly discovered sounds, DJs began to acquire and play rare and often deleted US releases that had not gained even a release in the UK."&lt;ref&gt;Rylatt, Keith and Phil Scott, ''Central 1179: The Story of Manchester's Twisted Wheel Club'', chapter 8 “Bye Bye Blues”&lt;/ref&gt; These records were sometimes obtained through specialist importers or, in some cases, by DJs visiting the US and purchasing old warehouse stock.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Keith Rylatt and Phil Scott, ''Central 1179: The Story of Manchester's Twisted Wheel Club'', chapter 10 “The Records”&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the original singers and musicians remained unaware of their newfound popularity for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Blackford, Andy, ''Disco Dancing Tonight'', chapter 5 “In the beginning”&lt;/ref&gt;

As the scene increased in popularity, a network of UK record dealers emerged who could acquire further copies of the original vinyl and supply them to fans at prices commensurate with their rarity and desirability.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Later on, a number of UK record labels capitalised on the booming popularity of Northern soul and negotiated licences for certain popular records from the copyright holders and reissue them as new 45s or compilation LPs. Among these labels were Casino Classics, PYE Disco Demand, Inferno, Kent Modern and Goldmine.&lt;ref&gt;Ritson, Mike &amp; Russell, Stuart. ''The In Crowd: The Story of the Northern &amp; Rare Soul Scene'', Chapter 15, page 215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Brewster (DJ)|Bill Brewster]] and Frank Broughton. ''Last Night A DJ Saved My Life''. Chapter 4, page 102, "Reissues and Commercialisation"&lt;/ref&gt;

The notoriety of DJs on the Northern soul scene was enhanced by the possession of rare records, but exclusivity was not enough on its own, and the records had to conform to a certain musical style and gain acceptance on the dance floor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Brewster (DJ)|Bill Brewster]] and Frank Broughton. ''Last Night a DJ Saved My Life''. Chapter 4, page 86, "A Genre Built From Failures"&lt;/ref&gt; Northern soul collectors seek rare singles by artists such as [[Holle Thee Maxwell|Holly Maxwell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimateunderground.com/upcoming-shows/the-underground-experience-presents-the-power-of-black-music-culture-sessions-series-6-featuring-holle-thee-maxewell-mr-charles-reese|title=THE Underground Experience Presents "The Power of Black Music &amp; Culture Sessions" Series No. 6" Featuring Holle Thee Maxwell &amp; Mr. Charles Reese! |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=|publisher=Ultimateunderground.com|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Chandler]], [[Barbara Acklin]], [[the Casualeers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/386699-Casualeers-The | title=The Casualeers | publisher=Discogs | accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jimmy Burns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classic45s.com/advanced_search_result.php?kev=yes&amp;sort=1a&amp;&amp;page=1 |title=Classic 45s from Kev Roberts' List of the Northern Soul Top 500|author=|website= classic45s.com|publisher=Classic 45s|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Wilson (musician)|Frank Wilson]]'s "[[Do I Love You (Indeed I Do)]]" has been rated the rarest and most valuable Northern soul single.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Brewster (DJ)|Bill Brewster]] and Frank Broughton.

===Hits and favourites===
The Northern soul movement spawned an active market in reissuing older soul recordings in the UK, several of which became popular enough to actually make the UK charts several years after their original issue. [[Dave Godin]] is generally credited with being the first UK entrepreneur to start this trend, setting up the [[Soul City Records (U.K. label)|Soul City label]] in 1968, and striking a deal with [[EMI]] to licence [[Gene Chandler]]'s 1965 recording "Nothing Can Stop Me", which had been popular for several years at the Twisted Wheel. Issued as a 45 on Soul City, the track peaked at UK No. 41 in August 1968, becoming the first Northern Soul-derived chart hit. A few months later in January 1969, [[Jamo Thomas]]' 1966 single "I Spy (For the FBI)" was similarly licensed and reissued, hitting UK No. 44.

The trend continued into the 1970s, as many songs from the 1960s that were revived on the Northern soul scene were reissued by their original labels and became UK top 40 hits. These include [[the Tams]]' 1964 recording "[[Hey Girl Don't Bother Me]]" (UK No. 1, July 1971) - which was popularised by Midlands DJ Carl Dene - [[the Fascinations]]' 1966 single "[[Girls Are Out to Get You]]" (UK No. 32, 1971), [[the Elgins]]' "[[Heaven Must Have Sent You]]" (UK No. 3 July 1971), [[the Newbeats]]' 1965 American hit "Run Baby Run" (UK No. 10, Oct 1971), [[Bobby Hebb]]'s "Love Love Love" which was originally the B-side of "A Satisfied Mind" (UK No. 32 August 1972), [[Robert Knight (musician)|Robert Knight]]'s "Love On a Mountain Top" of 1968 (UK No. 10, November 1973) and [[R. Dean Taylor]]’s "[[There's a Ghost in My House]]" from 1967 (UK No. 3, May 1974).

The Northern soul scene also spawned many lesser chart hits, including [[Al Wilson (singer)|Al Wilson]]'s 1968 cut "[[The Snake (Al Wilson song)|The Snake]]" (UK No. 41 in 1975), [[Dobie Gray]]'s "[[Out On the Floor]]" (UK No. 42, September 1975) and [[Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials]]' "[[Better Use Your Head]]" (UK No. 42 July 1976).

A variety of recordings were made later in the 1970s that were specifically aimed at the Northern soul scene, which also went on to become UK top 40 hits. These included: [[the Exciters]]’ "Reaching For the Best" (UK No. 31, October 1975), L. J Johnson's "Your Magic Put a Spell on Me" (UK No. 27, February 1976),&lt;ref&gt;Russ Winstanley and David Nowell. ''Soul Survivors: The Wigan Casino Story''. Chapter five, page 65&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tommy Hunt]]’s "Loving On the Losing Side" (UK No. 28, August 1976). "Goodbye Nothing To Say", by the white British group the Javells, was identified by Dave McAleer of Pye's Disco Demand label as having an authentic Northern soul feel. McAleer gave a white label promotional copy to Russ Winstanley (a Wigan Casino DJ and promoter), and the tune became popular among the dancers at the venue. Disco Demand then released the song as a 45 RPM single, reaching UK No. 26 in November 1974. To promote the single on BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', the performer was accompanied by two Wigan Casino dancers.&lt;ref&gt;Russ Winstanley and David Nowell. ''Soul Survivors: The Wigan Casino Story''. Chapter 2, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In at least one case, a previously obscure recording was specially remixed to appeal to Northern soul fans: the 1968 recording "[[Footsee]]" by Canadian group the Chosen Few was sped up, overdubbed and remixed to emerge as the 1975 UK No. 9 hit "Footsee", now credited to Wigan’s Chosen Few.&lt;ref&gt;Russ Winstanley and David Nowell. ''Soul Survivors: The Wigan Casino Story''. Chapter 7, page 95&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Northern soul favourite "[[Skiing In The Snow]]", originally by the Invitations, was covered by local band Wigan's Ovation, and reached No. 12 in the UK singles chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/875099006|title=Between Marx And Coca-cola: Youth Cultures in Changing European Societies, 1960–1980 |first1=Axel|last1=Schildt|publisher=Berghahn Books|first2=Siegfried|last2=Detlef|year=2006|isbn=9780857456854|location=New York|pages=318|oclc=875099006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These versions were not well received by the Northern soul community as their success brought wider awareness to the subculture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Northern Soul: Living for the Weekend|episode-link=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04bf1lf|access-date=2017-09-02|series=Northern Soul: Living for the Weekend|series-link=|last=|first=|network=BBC|station=BBC Four|date=2014-07-25|season=|series-no=|number=|minutes=40|time=|transcript=|transcript-url=|quote='Wigan's Ovation's cover version of a rare Northern Soul song became a major top 20 chart hit in 1975.

'I was into Bay City Rollers last year. Now I'm into Northern Soul'. You'd be speaking to work colleagues, they'd be saying, 'What are you into?', you'd say, 'Northern Soul', and they'd go, 'Oh, like Wigan's Ovation?'... 'No! How many times do I have to explain, that's as far away as it can possibly be?'... It horrified the purists. None of us at the venues were very happy about it, but what it did, it put Northern Soul on the music map for the industry.'|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first domestic [[disco]] hit, "[[Kung Fu Fighting]]" (UK No. 1, 1974), which was created by singer [[Carl Douglas]] and producer [[Biddu]] in Britain, was influenced by the Northern Soul scene.&lt;ref name="metro_biddu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biddu|author=James Ellis|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/interviews/412-biddu|accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Wigan Casino DJ Kev Roberts compiled ''The Northern Soul Top 500'', which was based on a survey of Northern soul fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/northern_soul_top_500.htm |title=Northern Soul Top 500 |publisher=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top ten songs were: "[[Do I Love You (Indeed I Do)]]" by [[Frank Wilson (musician)|Frank Wilson]], "Out on the Floor" by [[Dobie Gray]], "You Didn't Say a Word" by [[Yvonne Baker]], "[[The Snake (Al Wilson song)|The Snake]]" by [[Al Wilson (singer)|Al Wilson]], "Long After Tonight is Over" by [[Jimmy Radcliffe]], "Seven Day Lover" by James Fountain, "You Don't Love Me" by Epitome of Sound, "Looking for You" by [[Garnet Mimms]], "If That's What You Wanted" by [[Frankie Beverly]] &amp; the Butlers and "Seven Days Too Long" by Chuck Wood.

==Fashion and imagery==
[[File:NS fist logo.gif|right|thumb|Photograph of a sew-on patch featuring the clenched fist symbol adopted by the Northern soul movement]]
A large proportion of Northern soul's original audience came from within the 1960s [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] [[subculture]]. In the late 1960s, when some mods started to embrace [[freakbeat]] and [[psychedelic rock]], other mods - especially those in Northern England - stuck to the original mod soundtrack of soul and [[Blue Beat Records|Blue Beat]]. From the latter category, two strands emerged: [[skinhead]]s and the Northern soul scene.

Early Northern soul fashion included strong elements of the classic mod style, such as button-down [[Ben Sherman]] shirts, blazers with centre vents and unusual numbers of buttons, trickers and [[Brogues|brogue]] shoes and shrink-to-fit [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi's]] jeans.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Rylatt and Phil Scott. ''Central 1179: The Story of Manchester's Twisted Wheel Club''. BeeCool Publishing. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Some non-mod items, such as [[bowling]] shirts, were also popular. Later, Northern soul dancers started to wear light and loose-fitting clothing for reasons of practicality. This included high-waisted, baggy [[Oxford bags|Oxford trousers]] and sports vests. These were often covered with sew-on badges representing soul club memberships.

The clenched [[raised fist]] symbol that has become associated with the Northern soul movement emanates from the 1960s [[Black Power]] movement of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Wilson. ''Northern Soul: Music, Drugs and Subcultural Identity''. Chapter 2, Page 78&lt;/ref&gt; On his visit to the Twisted Wheel in 1971, Dave Godin recalled that "...very many young fellows wore black "right on now" racing gloves ... between records one would hear the occasional cry of "right on now!" or see a clenched gloved fist rise over the tops of the heads of the dancers!"&lt;ref name="soul-source.co.uk"/&gt;

==Drugs==
In 2007, Andrew Wilson (lecturer in criminology at the [[University of Sheffield]]) published the extensively researched sociological study ''Northern Soul: Music, drugs and subcultural identity''. This work details in some depth the lifestyles associated with the Northern soul scene and the extensive use of [[amphetamine]]s (otherwise known as speed) by many involved. Wilson argues that, although many did not use drugs, their usage was heavily ingrained in the fast-paced culture of the Northern soul scene, contributing to participants' ability to stay up all night dancing. Many clubs and events were closed down or refused licences due to the concern of local authorities that soul nights attracted drug dealers and users.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Wilson. ''Northern Soul: Music, Drugs and Subcultural Identity''. Chapter 3, Page 82&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Eagle, DJ at the Twisted Wheel club in Manchester, cited amphetamine usage among participants as his reason for quitting the club in 1967. Of the regular attendees he said, "All they wanted was fast-tempo black dance music... [but they were] too blocked on amphetamines to articulate exactly which Jackie Wilson record they wanted me to play."&lt;ref&gt;Keith Rylatt and Phil Scott, ''Central 1179: The Story of Manchester's Twisted Wheel Club'', BeeCool Publishing. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural legacy==
The Northern soul scene has had a notable influence on DJ culture, certain musicians, and has been portrayed in literature, theatre and cinema.

===Influence on DJ culture===
The Northern soul movement is cited by many as being a significant step towards the creation of contemporary club culture and of the [[Notable Club DJs|superstar DJ]] culture of the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Brewster (DJ)|Bill Brewster]] and Frank Broughton. ''Last Night a DJ Saved My Life'', Chapter 4, "Northern Soul: The First Rave Culture", page 85&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most notable DJs from the original Northern soul era are [[Russ Winstanley]] and [[Ian Levine]]. As in contemporary club culture, Northern soul DJs built up a following based on satisfying the crowd's desires for music that they could not hear anywhere else. The competitiveness between DJs to unearth 'in-demand' sounds led them to cover up the labels on their records, giving rise to the modern [[white label]] pressing. Many argue that Northern soul was instrumental in creating a network of clubs, DJs, record collectors and dealers in the UK, and was the first music scene to provide the British charts with records that sold entirely on the strength of club play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uppers.org/showArticle.asp?article=383 |title=From "The In Crowd" to the "Happy People" &amp;#124; Uppers Culture Lifestyle |publisher=Uppers.org |date= |accessdate=3 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019073257/http://www.uppers.org/showArticle.asp?article=383 |archivedate=19 October 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A technique employed by northern soul DJs in common with their later counterparts was the sequencing of records to create euphoric highs and lows for the crowd. Many of the DJ personalities and their followers involved in the original Northern soul movement went on to become important figures in the [[House music|house]] and [[dance music]] scenes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Brewster (DJ)|Bill Brewster]] and Frank Broughton. ''Last Night a DJ Saved My Life'', Chapter 4, "From Northern Soul to Nu-NRG", page 113&lt;/ref&gt; Notable among these are [[Mike Pickering]], who introduced house music to [[the Haçienda]] in Manchester in the 1980s, the influential DJ [[Colin Curtis (DJ)|Colin Curtis]], [[Neil Rushton]] the A&amp;R manager of the House music record label Kool Kat Music and the dance record producers [[Pete Waterman]], Johnathan Woodliffe, Ian Dewhirst and [[Ian Levine]].

===Influence on musicians===
Northern soul has influenced several notable musicians. Terry Christian — in his 2008 article about Northern soul for ''[[The Times]]'' —  wrote: "There's an instant credibility for any artist or brand associated with a scene that has always been wild, free and grassroots."
* [[Soft Cell]] had chart success in the early 1980s with covers of two popular Northern soul songs, "[[Tainted Love]]" (originally recorded by [[Gloria Jones]]) and [[Non Stop Ecstatic Dancing|"What?"]] (originally recorded by [[Melinda Marx]] on VJ, 1965, [[Judy Street]] 1966 and Tina Mason 1967). Soft Cell member [[David Ball (musician)|Dave Ball]] used to occasionally attend soul nights at Blackpool Mecca and Wigan Casino.&lt;ref&gt;Winstanley, Russ and David Nowell, ''Soul Survivors: The Wigan Casino Story'', Part V, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]'s 1981 song "Lie Dream of a Casino Soul" is about the Northern soul scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lie Dream of a Casino Soul|url=http://annotatedfall.doomby.com/pages/the-annotated-lyrics/lie-dream-of-a-casino-soul.html|website=The Annotated Fall|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and singer [[Mark E. Smith]] said in an interview published in the [[NME]] on October 1, 1983: "That song actually did create quite a bit of resentment in the North because people thought it was being snobby and horrible about the old soul boys, which it was never about anyway. Because I was brought up with people that were into Northern Soul five years before anybody down here [London] had even heard about it. But they've all grown out of it, which is what the song is about, but it wasn't putting them down at all. If anything, it was glorifying them, but not in the format of, where are those soul boys that used to be here?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watson|first1=Don|title=Looking At The Fall Guise|work=New Musical Express|publisher=Time Inc.|date=1 October 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Moloko]]'s video for "[[Familiar Feeling]]" is set against a Northern soul backdrop and was directed by [[Elaine Constantine]], a longstanding Northern soul enthusiast. The video was choreographed by DJ [[Keb Darge]], who rose to prominence at the Stafford Top of the World all-nighters in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Sxa8kca05A&amp;feature=related |title=Moloko "Familiar Feeling" - YouTube |publisher=Uk.youtube.com |date=8 April 2006 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fatboy Slim]]'s 1998 [[big beat]] single "[[The Rockafeller Skank]]" samples the [[Just Brothers]]' "Sliced Tomatoes". The song reached number 6 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and also had success in many other countries.
* The music video for [[Duffy (singer)|Duffy]]'s 2008 song "[[Mercy (Duffy song)|Mercy]]" features Duffy singing on a platform, accompanied by Northern soul dancers performing elaborate moves.&lt;ref name="wolfe"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.promonews.tv/2008/01/22/duffys-mercy-by-daniel-wolfe/| accessdate=19 July 2009| author=Knight, David | title=Duffy's Mercy by Daniel Wolfe| work=PromoNews| publisher=promonews.tv| date=22 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Plan B (musician)|Plan B’s]] 2010 album, ''[[The Defamation of Strickland Banks]]'' displays a significant Northern soul influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myirontongue.com/wordpress/?p=156] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827222503/http://myirontongue.com/wordpress/?p=156 |date=27 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://monkeyboxing.com/content/plan-b-defamation-strickland-banks-%E2%80%93-2010-%E2%80%93-album-review/ |title=PLAN B: The Defamation of Strickland Banks – 2010 – Album review |publisher=Monkeyboxing |date=18 April 2010 |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/522/plan_b_from_a_to_b |title=PLAN B: From A to B |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |date= |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video for "[[Stay Too Long]]" features northern soul-style dance moves such as spins, flips and backdrops. The album sleeve features Northern soul-style sew-on patches.
* The video for John Newman's 'Love Me Again' also features Northern Soul dancing as a backdrop to a Romeo and Juliet style romance.
* The video for the Courteeners' 'Are You In Love With a Notion' also features Northern Soul dancing.
* The video for [[Above and Beyond (band)|Above and Beyond]]'s 'Sun and Moon' also contains Northern Soul dancing.
*[[Paul Stuart Davies]] recorded 'Northern Soul Reimagined' in 2015, with guidance from Russ Winstanley, presenting classic Northern Soul tracks in a new light.

===Literature===
The Northern soul subculture has spawned a number of memoirs, novels and short stories. Maxwell Murray's 
''Crackin Up: A Tale of Sex Drugs and Northern Soul'' was published in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0953644006?*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0 |title=Crackin' Up: A Tale of Sex, and Drugs, and Northern Soul: Amazon.co.uk: Maxwell Murray: 9780953644001: Books |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Snowball and Pete McKenna published ''In the Blood'' in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1849631603?*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0 |title=In the Blood: Amazon.co.uk: Ian Snowball, Pete McKenna: 9781849631600: Books |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a volume including their ''All Souled Out'' short stories and ''Nightshift'' memoir in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countdownbooks.com/dir/?page_id=298] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226102531/http://countdownbooks.com/dir/?page_id=298 |date=26 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both focus on the East London scene. Chris Rose's 2014 ''Wood, Talc and Mr J'' takes a more literary approach and is based on the Sheffield scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wood-Talc-Mr-Chris-Rose-ebook/dp/B00LOWZJTK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420628560&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=wood+talc+%26+Mr+J |title=Wood, Talc and Mr. J eBook: Chris Rose, Virginie Gervais |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://woodtalcandmrj.com |title=STEP IN AND WRITE… OR JUST DO WHAT YOU DO BEST! A Blog for Souls of the Underground: the lesser known talents, writers… and artists |publisher=Woodtalcandmrj.com |date=13 October 2014 |accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Mr J" in the title is [[Chuck Jackson]]. Northern Soul also features in [[Nick Hornby]]'s ''[[Juliet, Naked]]''.

===Theatre===
''Northern Soul'' is the title of a 2012 theatre piece by the British visual and performance artist, [[Victoria Melody]]. According to a description on the Solo Theatre website,&lt;ref name="Victoria Melody: Northern Soul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sohotheatre.com/whats-on/victoria-melody-northern-soul/ |title=Victoria Melody: Northern Soul |publisher=Sohotheatre.com |date= |accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Victoria, an untrained dancer, has been travelling the dance halls and living rooms of England being taught to dance by Northern Soul’s ex-champions. Northern Soul draws on those investigations and explores the ‘soul of the north’ using film and original Northern Soul dance moves.'&lt;ref name="Victoria Melody: Northern Soul"/&gt;

===Film===
Films set in the Northern soul scene include 2010's ''[[Soulboy (film)|Soulboy]]'' and 2014's ''[[Northern Soul (film)|Northern Soul]]''.

'''Otto Hirschfeld''' (March 16, 1843 – March 27, 1922) was a German [[epigraphist]] and professor of [[ancient history]] who was a native of [[Königsberg]].

In 1863 received his doctorate from the [[University of Königsberg]], and in 1869 became a professor at the [[University of Göttingen]]. In 1872 he became a professor of classical studies at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], and in 1876 a professor of [[epigraphy]] and ancient history at the [[University of Vienna]]. In 1885 he succeeded [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817-1903) as professor of ancient history at the [[University of Berlin]], where he remained until his retirement in 1917.

At [[Vienna]] he organized the Archeologic-Epigraphic Seminary with [[archaeologist]] [[Alexander Conze]] (1831-1914). Hirschfeld edited several volumes of the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', in which he largely dealt with [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] of [[Gaul]] and [[Germania]].  Other writings include: ''Untersuchungen auf dem Gebiete der römischen Verwaltungsgeschichte'' (1876), ''Inscriptiones Galliae Narbonensis Latinae'' (1888) and ''Inscriptiones Aquitaniae et Lugdunensis'' (1899).

'''Prehistoric archaeology''' is the study of the past before historical records began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=1662101 |pmid=17758391 |title=Prehistoric Archeology, Past, Present and Future |first=N. C. |last=Nelson |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=85 |issue=2195 |date=22 January 1937 |pages=81-89 |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |doi=10.1126/science.85.2195.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a field of research that looks at all the pre-urban societies of the world. It also has distinctive set of procedures for analyzing material remains so that archaeologists can reconstruct their ecological settings. The study of prehistoric archaeology reflects the cultural concerns of modern society by showing interpretations of time between economic growth and political stability.&lt;ref name=Fagan&gt;{{cite book |year=1996 |title=The Oxford Companion to Archaeology |first=Brian M. |last=Fagan |author-link=Brian M. Fagan |edition=1st |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780199891085 |doi=10.1093/acref/9780195076189.001.0001 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=ystMAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |oclc=35178577}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has very close links with biology, biological anthropology, and geology.&lt;ref name=Fagan/&gt; It is also sometimes termed at anthropological archaeology because of its indirect traces with complex patterns.&lt;ref name=Fagan/&gt;

In Western Europe the prehistoric period generally ends with [[Roman empire|Roman]] colonisation although in many other places, notably [[Egypt]] and [[China]], it finishes much earlier and in others, such as [[Australia]], much later. A transitional phase of [[protohistory]] or [[protohistoric archaeology]] may exist where written records provide a limited picture of the society in question.

The earliest record of the word ''prehistoric'' comes from the French archaeologist and scientist [[Paul Tournal]] who used it in 1831 to describe the finds he made in ancient caves he had investigated in the [[Bize-Minervois]] in the south of France. It did not enter English as an archeological term until 1851 when it was used by the Scots-Canadian archaeologist Sir [[Daniel Wilson (academic)|Daniel Wilson]]. The [[three-age system]], which just predates the coining of the term, was created in an attempt to make sense of the chronology of prehistoric Europe.

Without history to provide evidence for names, places and motivations, prehistoric archaeologists speak in terms of [[archaeological culture|culture]]s which can only be given arbitrary modern names relating to the locations of known occupation sites or the [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s used. It is naturally much easier to discuss societies rather than individuals as these past people are completely anonymous in the archaeological record.

Such a lack of concrete information means that prehistoric archaeology is a contentious field and the arguments that rage over it have done much to inform [[archaeological theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/CMPL/article/viewFile/43364/41036 |title=Why the history of archaeology is essential to theoretical archaeology |first=Tim |last=Murray |author-link=Tim Murray (archaeologist) |journal=Complutum |date=17 June 2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=21-31 |issn=1131-6993 |doi=10.5209/rev_CMPL.2013.v24.n2.43364 |format=PDF |access-date=2 October 2018 |publisher=[[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of theories regarding the purpose of objects or sites for example obliges archaeologists to adopt a critical approach to all evidence and to examine their own constructs of the past. [[Structural functionalism]] and [[processualism]] are two schools of archaeological thought which have made a great contribution to prehistoric archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2798577 |title=Major Concepts of Archaeology in Historical Perspective |first=Bruce G. |last=Trigger |author-link=Bruce G.

He was born in 1676, and lost his father early. He started his studies in 1686 in [[Kolozsvár]] after he continued it in [[Nagyszombat]] Hungarian Catholic University. In 1695/96, he earned his doctor degree in law and free arts. He returned to [[Transylvania]] and remained loyal supporter of the [[Habsburgs]].

In 1699, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] nominated him as count (''főispán'') of [[Küküllő]] county (highest administrative position in the Hungarian county). He suffered material losses in the [[Rákóczi's War for Independence|Rákóczi revolution]]. In 1704, he lived in [[Kronstadt]] after fled to [[Wallachia]]. In 1706, he returned and joined the revolution. In 1707 Colonel Graven captured him and he was kept in custody for 2 years. In 1707, he was excused and nominated as [[Háromszék]] royal judge. In 1713, he was granted the countship (as hereditary count, part of the aristocracy, only title).

He fled from the epidemic to the [[Moldovans|Moldavian]] [[Galați]] and spent few years there. In 1744, he was nominated to government position in [[Vienna]] as "main court consultant" and received from [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles III]] a golden necklace. He did not work in his new position but remained in  [[Transylvania]].

'''Randall Hansen''' is a [[political scientist]] and [[historian]] at the [[University of Toronto]], where he has held a [[Canada Research Chair]] in [[Political science|Political Science]] since 2005. He is the Director of the Centre for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies at the [[Munk School of Global Affairs]] and is jointly appointed to the [[University of Toronto School of Public Policy and Governance|School of Public Policy and Governance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://munkschool.utoronto.ca/profile/hansen-randall/ |title= Randall Hansen|publisher= Munk School of Global Affairs|access-date= 2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen taught at the [[Queen Mary University of London]] and the [[University of Oxford]] (where he was a tutorial fellow at Merton College) before taking up his current position. He will become the Interim Director of the Munk School effective June 1, 2017.

His fields of research are migration and citizenship, eugenics and population policy, and the effect of war on civilian populations. He has authored three books, ''Citizenship and Immigration in Postwar Britain'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Hansen|first= Randall|title= Citizenship and Immigration in Postwar Britain|date= 2000|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 9780198297093|oclc= 43419152}} Also {{ISBN|9780199240548}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fire and Fury: the Allied Bombing of Germany 1942-1945'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Hansen|first= Randall|title= Fire and Fury: the Allied Bombing of Germany 1942–1945|date= 2008|location= Toronto|publisher= Doubleday Canada|isbn= 9780451227591|oclc= 268795501}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Disobeying Hitler: German Resistance after Valkyrie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Hansen|first= Randall|title= Disobeying Hitler: German Resistance after Valkyrie|date= 2014|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 9780199927920|oclc= 885970110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fire and Fury'' was shortlisted for the Governor General’s Literary Award for Non-Fiction in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://ggbooks.ca/~/media/ggbooks/2016/ggla%20cumulative%20finalists%20list%20to%202016.pdf |format= PDF|title= Cumulative list of finalists for the Governor General's Literary Awards|publisher= Governor General’s Literary Awards|page= 81|access-date= 2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, he has contributed numerous articles to academic journals.

In 2018, sales of ''Fire and Fury'' surged upon the publication of [[Michael Wolff (journalist)|Michael Wolff]]'s best-selling [[Fire and Fury|book of the same title]] about the [[Presidency of Donald Trump]].  Some people bought Hansen's book by mistake, while others became aware of it because of the publicity over the Wolff book.  ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported Hansen's reaction to the interest in his book about the consequences of war:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"And we’re talking about that at a moment when we have this warmongering, unstable, deranged demagogue in the [[White House]]," he said. "So that coincidence actually makes me happier than the sales."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Kassam | first = Ashifa | title = The other Fire and Fury: decade-old book becomes unexpected bestseller  | newspaper = [[The Guardian]]| date = 9 January 2018 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/09/the-other-fire-and-fury-decade-old-book-becomes-unexpected-bestseller | access-date = 2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Saratoga International Theater Institute''' (also known as '''SITI''') is an [[ensemble cast|ensemble]]-based [[theater company]] whose three ongoing components are the creation of new work, the training of young theater artists, and a commitment to international collaboration.

SITI was founded in 1992 by [[Anne Bogart]] and [[Tadashi Suzuki]] to redefine and revitalize contemporary [[theater]] in the United States through an emphasis on international cultural exchange and collaboration. Originally envisioned as a summer institute in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], SITI has expanded to encompass a year-round program based in [[New York City]] with a summer season in Saratoga. SITI believes that contemporary American theater must necessarily incorporate artists from around the world and learn from the resulting cross-cultural exchange of [[dance]], [[music]], [[art]], and performance experiences. 

SITI is noted for combining the [[Viewpoints]] of [[Anne Bogart]] with the Suzuki Method of Actor Training of [[Tadashi Suzuki]]. Both techniques are alternatives to the Stanislavski-based Method training which dominates the American stage and screen. Actors in the company regularly train together and use the training as part of their rehearsal and warm-up process. In addition to the year-round program in [[New York City]] and the summer institute in Saratoga, SITI teaches both the [[Viewpoints]] and the Suzuki Method in residencies and masterclasses at colleges and universities across the United States.

In creating and touring productions, SITI has developed ongoing relationships with theaters and arts centers in both the United States and abroad. The three most significant to SITI's history and development as a company are the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]], the Actors Theatre of Louisville, and the [[City Theatre (Pittsburgh)|City Theatre]] in Pittsburgh.

The '''South Georgia Museum''' is situated in [[Grytviken]], near the administrative centre of the [[UK overseas territory]] of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].

The museum occupies the renovated and converted manager's villa built in 1916, and used as a residence for the manager of the [[Grytviken]] [[whaling]] station and his family, until the station closed in 1964.  The South Georgia Museum was established in 1991 as a specialised whaling museum, subsequently expanding its expositions to include all aspects of the discovery of the island, [[seal hunting|sealing industry]], maritime and natural history, as well as the 1982 [[Falklands war]].

The museum has become a popular tourist venue, visited by [[cruise ship]] or [[yacht]] tourists.  For several years Tim and Pauline Carr served as museum [[curator]]s, living on board their yacht ''Curlew'' moored in the Grytviken port. The museum is now managed by the [[South Georgia Heritage Trust]] and is manned by three members of staff who are the only non-permanent residents who live in Grytviken.

The museum displays include a bronze bust of [[Duncan Carse]] by British sculptor [[Jon Edgar]]. Carse was influential in the mapping of South Georgia and the island's [[Mount Carse]] is named after him. The [http://ehive.com/account/3408 collection of the museum] can be viewed online.

An occasional [[artist-in-residence]] position is supported by the museum. Previous artists to have been resident at the museum include the British sculptor [[Anthony Smith (sculptor)|Anthony Smith]], who in November 2017 delivered a life-sized bronze portrait bust of [[Sir Ernest Shackleton]] to the Museum, which is now on permanent display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Georgia Newsletter, September 2013|url=http://www.gov.gs/NewsArchive/newsletters/(h)South_Georgia_Newsletter,_September_2013.html|website=Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Georgia Newsletter, November 2017|url=http://www.gov.gs/nov-17-newsletter/|website=Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3247">The '''Springer Hoax''' was a [[scam]] starting in the mid 19th century, often using a phony [[genealogy]] in various ways to collect money based on the supposed estate of prominent colonialist [[Charles (Carl Christopher) Springer]] and debts said to be owed to him by various government agencies of [[Wilmington, Delaware]] and [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. The alleged estate was said to include 1,900 acres of land, 228 acres of which ran through the center of Wilmington, worth up to $150,000,000. Other claims included $100,000,000 deposited in a Stockholm bank.&lt;ref name=guide&gt;Delaware Federal Writers' Project. US History Publishers, 1948, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vJ5OeFvqWRAC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;dq=%22Delaware,+a+guide+to+the+first+State%22+springer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wvPoF3_YNI&amp;sig=elcwVBFbuENi0ChoyFD36LGvq6g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ruryTPTlAYOClAf9ounpDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Delaware, a guide to the first State'', pp. 276-7.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable today primarily as the result of mistaken reliance on the various fraudulent and/or erroneous Springer genealogies going back to [[Adam and Eve]] via Emperor [[Charlemagne]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Wilmington's supposed debt was related to land purportedly owned by Springer. The land actually had belonged to [[Holy Trinity Church (Old Swedes)|Old Swedes' Church]]. Springer was merely a life trustee for the land. The tie to Sweden was based on a phony genealogy used to claim that Springer was part of the Swedish Aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;"Haunted Delaware: Ghosts And Strange Phenomena of the First State". Patricia A. Martinelli, Stackpole Books, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8117-3297-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one version of the scam from the 1850s, people claiming to be Springer heirs sold stock in the "Springer Heirs Corporation", supposedly to file court cases to prove their alleged ownership of large sections of real estate in the downtown area of Wilmington, Delaware or the royal jewels of Sweden. The corporation folded after a few minor court cases for several small, unclaimed estates.

A later version of the scam was started in 1913, targeting actual and possible descendants of Springer. Again, the estate was said to hold legitimate title to large sections of land in Wilmington. Victims were enticed into buying shares in the "Springer Heirs Corporation 1913 U.S. American&lt;!---sic---&gt; and Canada".&lt;ref&gt;"Pitfalls in Genealogical Research". Milton Rubicam, Ancestry Publishing, 1987. {{ISBN|0-916489-28-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When indicted for charges of larceny, several perpetrators of the scam claimed that their story was essentially true and the truth was being hidden by a conspiracy involving the courts, the government of Wilmington, and the Old Swedes' Church.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1883/12/23/106270640.pdf The Fabulous Springer Estate: George W. Ponton Claims to be the Victim of a Hoax]", [[New York Times]], December 23, 1883.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Body''''' is a 2001 English-language [[Political cinema|political thriller]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] based on a [[The Body (Sapir novel)|novel]] by [[Richard Sapir]], and starring [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Olivia Williams]].

The film, a joint American, Israeli and German production, follows Father Matt Gutierrez (Banderas), a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest sent by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to investigate an [[archaeology|archaeologic]] finding by Dr. Sharon Golban (Williams) which is suspected to be the remains of the body of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. This finding puts Gutierrez's faith and his doubts in constant confrontation with Golban's scientific views.

Also, the finding stirs the political problems between Palestine and Israel in the area, while also shaking the foundations of [[Christianity]] itself. Both of these problems put Dr. Golban, and Gutierrez himself, in danger.

==Plot==

Dr. Sharon Golban (Williams) finds an ancient skeleton in Jerusalem in a rich man's tomb. Coloration of the wrist and ankle bones indicates the cause of death was [[crucifixion]]. Several artifacts, including a gold coin bearing the marks of [[Pontius Pilate]] and a jar dating to 32 AD, date the tomb to the year [[Jesus|Christ]] died. Faint markings on the skull consistent with thorns, the absence of broken leg bones, occupational markers suggesting the deceased was a carpenter, and a nick on the ribs from a pointed object lead authorities to suspect that these could be the bones of Christ. The different reactions of politicians, clerics, religious extremists—some prepared to use terror to gain their ends—to the religious, cultural and political implications of the find, make life difficult and dangerous for the investigators as they seek to unearth the truth.

Father Matt Gutierrez is assigned by the Vatican to investigate the case and to protect the [[Christian faith]]. He sets out to prove that the bones are not those of Jesus, but as there is more and more evidence to support the claim, his faith begins to waver. Troubled by the case, he turns to Father Lavelle (Derek Jacobi) who commits suicide because he cannot reconcile the scientific evidence with his faith. This event causes Father Gutierrez to turn from his faith, but he comes back to it in the end. He also comes to understand that it is the [[Catholic Church]] that he is protecting and not the faith, and decides to resign from his priesthood.

==Themes==
The film deals mainly with two subjects:
* The [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] in the region where the body is found. Both sides believe that control of the site will give them an upper hand in the conflict.
* The importance of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection of Jesus Christ]] in the Christian faith.

==Archaeology in the film==
Dr. Golban is much more meticulous in her work than many other film archaeologists are. She examines the bones found without removing them from the site, and is very careful not to compromise the remains or any other artifacts found. The small things at the site are not overlooked and looting is one of the problems she faces, which are both aspects of real archaeology&lt;ref&gt;http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/24-3/Miller.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[small finds]]). For instance, she uses several methods for dating the tomb such as [[thermoluminescence dating]] and relative dating techniques.

===Thermoluminesence dating===
The clay jar that is found inside the tomb was brought to a lab for two kinds of testing: dating and composition of contents. Dr. Golban wanted to determine the age (and therefore date the tomb) and figure out what the jar was used for. [[Thermoluminescence dating]] is commonly used on ancient pottery and tools. This technique is used to determine the time passed since an object was fired (such as pottery). It has been found to be very accurate, to within ±1 to 10%.&lt;ref&gt;Pagonis, Vasilis, Reuven Chen, and George Kitis. "On The Intrinsic Accuracy And Precision Of Luminescence Dating Techniques For Fired Ceramics." Journal of Archaeological Science 38.7 (2011): 1591-1602. Academic Search Complete. Web. 6 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It works by thermally stimulating the object in question, thereby releasing the energy accumulated in the object during its preliminary excitation.&lt;ref&gt;N. Sorokina, et al. "Thermoluminescent Dating Of Archaeological Pottery." Inorganic Materials 47.5 (2011): 544-548. Academic Search Complete. Web. 6 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, when an object is fired, electrons are released within the object itself and its 'clock' is set to "0". Thermoluminescence releases trapped electrons and uses the amount of energy released to determine the time since that initial firing (time '0').

To determine how the jar was used and what it contained, the lab performed [[mass spectrometry]] tests on it. Mass spectrometry is typically the process used to identify unknown substances found on/in archaeological sites. A sample of the contents of the jar is loaded into the mass spectrometry machine where it is then bombarded by electrons causing it to become ionized. This process causes molecules from the sample to break off in charged fragments. The ions are then deflected by an electric or magnetic field which are then picked up by an electron multiplayer. A spectra results from the abundance of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. The fragments are then identified through comparison to known molecular weights and fragmentation patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, Francis. Organic Chemistry. 4th ed. McGraw-Hill Higher Education. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of the jar were found to be an [[anointing]] oil. The jar was an [[anointing]] jar, which was one aspect of Jewish burial rituals.

===Shroud of Turin===

Briefly in the film Father Matt Gutierrez and archaeologist Dr. Sharon Golban talk about the famous [[Shroud of Turin]]. The 4.1 m × 1.1 m linen cloth is well known for its depiction of an image of a man that looks very similar to the description of Jesus Christ. The man on the shroud suffered from physical injuries very similar to those that someone would bear after being crucified, consistent with the Biblical description of Christ's crucifixion. Father Gutierrez mentions the Shroud of Turin when there is a question over the height of the body that is found in the tomb. He says the bones in the tomb can’t possibly be those of Jesus Christ because the height of the skeleton found does not fit with the height of the man believed to be Christ portrayed on the Shroud of Turin.

The bones in the tomb belong to a person who would stand at a height of approximately 5'5", whereas the body that is believed to be Christ's on the shroud is of a man of 5'11½" to 6'2"; while the Bible does reference Jesus as being tall, during the times of Christ such a height would indeed have been remarkable. Dr. Golban responds with some animosity towards his comment because the Shroud of Turin has been proven through scientific testing to be a hoax and not the image of Jesus Christ but instead a victim of Roman crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham, William. 1983 The Authentication of the Turin Shroud: An Issue in Archaeological Epistemology. CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY 24. Web. Jan 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Shroud of Turin is believed to be an artist's representation of Jesus by means of using an impression technique on the linen.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Marvin. 1983 The Authentication of the Turin Shroud: An Issue in Archaeological Epistemology.

The '''General Crisis''' is the term used by some historians to describe the period of widespread conflict and instability that occurred from the early 17th century to the early 18th century in [[History of Europe|Europe]] and in more recent historiography in the world at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://sgtbkhalsadu.ac.in/colleges/tutorial/112718122009232906.113.5.pdf | title = Tutorial | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | publisher = Sgt Bkhalsadu | place = [[India|IN]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept is much debated by historians and there is no consensus.

==What was the "General Crisis"?==
The term was coined by [[Eric Hobsbawm]] in his pair of 1954 articles entitled "The Crisis of the Seventeenth Century" published in ''Past and Present''. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{Explain|date=July 2018}}

As a historiographic concept, the place of the general crisis was cemented by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], in a 1959 article entitled "The General Crisis of the Seventeenth Century" published in the same journal. Hobsbawm discussed an economic crisis in Europe; Trevor-Roper saw a wider crisis, "a crisis in the relations between society and the State".{{Sfn | Aston | 1965 | p = 67}}  Trevor-Roper argued that the middle years of the 17th century in Western Europe saw a widespread break-down in politics, economics and society caused by a complex series of demographic, religious, economic and political problems. In this "general crisis", various events such as the [[English Civil War]], the [[Fronde]] in [[Kingdom of France|France]], the climax of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and revolts against the [[List of Spanish monarchs|Spanish Crown]] in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Naples]] and [[Catalonia]] were all manifestations of the same problem. The most important cause of the "general crisis",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Robinson | first = Kristen | contribution = Trevor-Roper, Hugh | title = The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing | pages = 1204–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in Trevor-Roper’s opinion, was the conflict between "Court" and "Country"; that is between the increasingly powerful centralizing, bureaucratic, sovereign princely states represented by the court, and the traditional, regional, land-based aristocracy and gentry representing the country. In addition, the intellectual and religious changes introduced by the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]] were important secondary causes of the "general crisis".

There were various controversies regarding the "general crisis" thesis between historians.  Some simply denied the existence of any such crisis. For instance, Hobsbawm saw the problems of 17th-century Europe as being  social and economic in origin – an emphasis than Trevor-Roper would not concede.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{Explain|date=July 2018}}

Subsequent historians interested in the General Crisis include [[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]], who has authored a book on the subject.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{Explain|date=July 2018}}

== Global patterns ==
Many historians have argued the 17th century was an era of crisis.{{Sfn | Parker | Smith | 1997}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}{{Sfn | Aston | 1965}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}  Many other historians have rejected the idea.{{who |date=June 2015}} Today there are historians who promote the crisis model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = JB | last = Shank | title = Crisis: A Useful Category of Post-Social Scientific Historical Analysis? | journal = American Historical Review | year = 2008 | volume = 113 | number = 4 | pages = 1090–99 | doi=10.1086/ahr.113.4.1090}}.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing it provides an invaluable insight into the warfare, politics, economics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jan | last = de Vries | title = The Economic Crisis of the Seventeenth Century after Fifty Years | journal = Journal of Interdisciplinary History | year = 2009 | volume = 40 | number = 2 | pages = 151–94 | jstor = 40263652 | doi=10.1162/jinh.2009.40.2.151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and even art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter | last = Burke | title = The Crisis in the Arts of the Seventeenth Century: A Crisis of Representation? | journal = Journal of Interdisciplinary History | year = 2009 | volume = 40 | number = 2 | pages = 239–61 | jstor = 40263655 | doi=10.1162/jinh.2009.40.2.239}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thirty Years War]] (1618–48) focused attention on the massive horrors that wars could bring to entire populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter H | last = Wilson | title = The Thirty Years War: Europe’s Tragedy | year = 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}  The 1640s in particular saw more state breakdowns around the world than any previous or subsequent period.{{Sfn | Parker | Smith | 1997}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}{{Sfn | Aston | 1965}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}  The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the largest state in Europe, temporarily disappeared. In addition, there were secessions and upheavals in several parts of the [[Spanish Empire]], the world’s first global empire.  In Britain the entire [[House of Stuart|Stuart monarchy]] ([[Kingdom of England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland]], [[Kingdom of Ireland]], and [[British America]]) rebelled.  Political insurgency and a spate of popular revolts seldom equaled shook the foundations of most states in Europe and Asia.  More wars took place around the world in the mid-17th century than in almost any other period of recorded history.  The crises spread far beyond Europe—for example [[Ming China]], the most populous state in the world, collapsed.{{Sfn | Parker | 2008 | pp = 1053–79}}

China’s Ming dynasty and Japan’s [[Tokugawa shogunate]] had radically different economic, social, and political systems. However, they experienced a series of crises during the mid-17th century that were at once interrelated and strikingly similar to those occurring in other parts of the world at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = William S | last = Atwell | title = Some Observations on the ‘Seventeenth-Century Crisis’ in China and Japan | journal = Journal of Asian Studies | year = 1986 | volume = 45 | number = 2 | pages = 223–44 | doi=10.2307/2055842}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Frederic Wakeman]] argues that the crisis which destroyed the Ming dynasty was partly a result of the climatic change as well as China’s already significant involvement in the developing world economy.  Bureaucratic dishonesty worsened the problem.  Moreover, the [[Qing dynasty]]’s success in dealing with the crisis made it more difficult for it to consider alternative responses when confronted with severe challenges from the West in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Frederic E | last = Wakeman | title = China and the Seventeenth-Century Crisis | journal = Late Imperial China | year = 1986 | volume = 7 | number = 1 | pages = 1–26 | doi=10.1353/late.1986.0006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicts and Wars ==
Examples which have been given for general crisis and state breakdown during this period include:
* The [[Thirty Years War]] in Germany (1618–48)
* The Economic Crisis in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (1619–23)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.jstor.org/pss/2123055 | title = JStor}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] (1639–51), [[The Protectorate]] (1653–59), and the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688) in Britain and Ireland
* The collapse of the [[Ming Dynasty]] and rise of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in China (1644–62)
* The [[Fronde]] in France (1643–68)
* Revolts against the [[Spain|Spanish crown]] in [[Naples]], [[Portugal]], and [[Catalonia]]
* The climax of the [[Dutch Revolt]] and related conflicts (ends in 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]])
* Numerous internal revolts in the [[Ottoman Empire]] (especially 1622)
* The disintegration of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]]
* The beginning of [[Sakoku]] in Japan and the [[Shimabara Uprising]] (1638)
* The [[Char Bouba War]] in [[Mauritania]] (1644–74)
* The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–14)
* Several wars of succession in the [[Mughal Empire]] (1600-1605 between [[Akbar]] and [[Salim Nuruddin Jahangir|Salim]]; 1605; [[Shahjahan]]'s revolt)

==Inflation==
Precious metals from newly discovered deposits in [[United States|America]], especially silver from [[Potosí]] in modern [[Bolivia]] and from [[Mexico]], were shipped by [[Spain]] to [[China]] as well as to Europe.  Silver was less prevalent in China than in Europe and consequently more valuable.  The continuous flow of silver from the New World caused a continuous flow of wealth from China to Spain.  The silver imports also caused general price inflation throughout Europe.  Rapid population growth until the mid-decades of the seventeenth century also initially contributed to inflation in some areas.{{Citation needed |date=June 2015}}

== Demographic decline ==
For those who extend the General Crisis outside Europe, one symptom is dramatic population decline. For example, with the collapse of the [[Ming Dynasty]] the population of China fell by approximately 50 million between 1600 and 1644, a decrease of over 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Germany's population was reduced by approximately 15% to 30% in the [[Thirty Years War]].&lt;ref name="TYW-1618-48-TWC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat0.htm#30YrW |title=The Thirty Years War (1618–48) | work =Twentieth Century Atlas|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] also lost about a third of its population. Many theories have been proposed as to why population dropped so rapidly during this period.  Renowned economist Robert Malthus proposed the theory of population limitation as a result of carrying capacity. In his theory, food supplies simply did not grow as fast as population. As such, the subsistence gap between food and population created a check on the population.  In applying this theory to the demographic crisis of this period, much focus has been placed on the growth and expansion of the "new" monarchies of late medieval Europe.  These newly centralized and bureaucratized monarchies with their greater demands for war placed greater demands on the populaces of their realms. The previously mentioned climatic change also helped to exacerbate these new problems of war.{{Citation needed |date=June 2015}}

== Climate change ==
The General Crisis overlaps fairly neatly with the [[Little Ice Age]] which some authorities locate in the 17th century. Of particular interest is the overlap with the [[Maunder Minimum]].  Across the Northern Hemisphere, the mid-17th century experienced almost unprecedented death rates. Geoffrey Parker has suggested that environmental factors may have been in part to blame, especially the global cooling trend of this period.{{Sfn | Parker | Smith | 2008}}

'''''The History of Cardenio''''', often referred to as merely '''''Cardenio''''', is a [[lost work|lost play]], known to have been performed by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], a London theatre company, in 1613.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, E. K. ''The Elizabethan Stage.'' 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923. Vol 2, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The play is attributed to [[William Shakespeare]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] in a [[Stationers' Register]] entry of 1653. The content of the play is not known, but it was likely to have been based on an episode in [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' involving the character [[List of Don Quixote characters|Cardenio]], a young man who has been driven mad and lives in the [[Sierra Morena]]. [[Thomas Shelton (translator)|Thomas Shelton]]'s translation of the First Part of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1612, and would thus have been available to the presumed authors of the play.

Two existing plays have been put forward as being related to the lost play. A song, "Woods, Rocks and Mountains", set to music by [[Robert Johnson (English composer)|Robert Johnson]], has also been linked to it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wilson (scholar)|Richard Wilson]], ''Secret Shakespeare: studies in theatre, religion and resistance'', [[Manchester University Press]] 2004 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=rdSyQbU3SS4C&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=cardenio+wood&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QfRMoJ7jRN&amp;sig=D1dFtqUAKIkZT-dv1bwHpMOaccw#PPA232,M1 p.233] on Google books). This source refers to Michael Wood's claims regarding Shakespeare's authorship of "Woods, rocks, and mountains".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFiWwHnyWUw "Woods Rocks and Mountains"] performed on Youtube&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution==
Although there are records of the play having been performed, there is no information about its authorship earlier than a 1653 entry in the Stationers' Register. The entry was made by [[Humphrey Moseley]], a bookseller and publisher, who was thereby asserting his right to publish the work. Moseley is not necessarily to be trusted on the question of authorship, as he is known to have falsely used Shakespeare's name in other such entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dominik|first=Mark|title=William Shakespeare and 'The Birth of Merlin'|edition=1991|year=1985|publisher=[[Philosophical Library]]|location=New York|isbn=0-945088-03-5|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It may be that he was using Shakespeare's name to increase interest in the play.&lt;ref name="Maltby20110201"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/arts-and-culture/night-and-day/6662493/theatre-fake-shakespeare.thtml|title=Fake Shakes(peare)|last=Maltby|first=Kate|date=1 February 2011|work=[[The Spectator]]|accessdate=28 May 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some modern scholarship accepts Moseley's attribution, placing the lost work in the same category of collaboration between Fletcher and Shakespeare as ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Luis Pujante, "''Double Falsehood'' and the Verbal Parallels with Shelton's ''Don Quixote''," ''Shakespeare Survey'', Vol. 51 (1998), pp. 95–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Fletcher based several of his later plays on works by Cervantes, so his involvement is plausible.

==Synopsis of "Cardenio", the episode in the novel ''Don Quixote''==
After a few adventures together, Don Quixote and Sancho discover a bag full of gold coins along with some papers, which include a sonnet describing the poet's romantic troubles. Don Quixote and Sancho search for the person to whom the gold and the papers belong. They find him; it is Cardenio, a strange bare-footed character who leaps about from rock to rock like a mountain goat and whose clothes are in shreds. Cardenio, who lives in the hollow formed in a cork tree, rants and rages in anger regarding one Don Fernando.

Cardenio then relates to Don Quixote and Sancho the miserable story of his love for the wealthy and beautiful Luscinda: after Cardenio had received a letter from Luscinda suggesting that she might accept his proposal of marriage, he asks his wealthy and noble friend Don Fernando to arrange the wedding.  Don Fernando has recently seduced and agreed to marry a young woman named Dorotea, but when he meets Luscinda he decides to steal her from Cardenio. To do this, he sends Cardenio away on an errand. Luscinda then writes a letter to Cardenio to alert him to the fact that he is being double-crossed, and that her father has agreed to have her marry the wealthy Don Fernando. She tells Cardenio that she is in her wedding gown, and that "the traitor Don Fernando", along with her father and witnesses, are all assembled for the wedding. She secretly has a knife hidden in the folds of her dress, and she intends to commit suicide. Cardenio arrives and hides behind a tapestry to watch the nuptials. When it comes time to exchange the vows, Luscinda pauses, and then in a dismayed voice says "I will". The bridegroom goes to kiss his bride, but she swoons. Cardenio, upset, hops on his donkey, leaves town, and becomes an angry man living in the mountains.

Luscinda runs away to flee her new husband. The story ends with all the principals being brought together, including Dorotea, who had also run away from Don Fernando, and with loose ends being tied up:  Don Fernando repents and apologizes to a forgiving Cardenio. Cardenio is reunited with Luscinda, and Don Fernando is reunited with Dorotea.&lt;ref&gt;Cervantes. ''Don Quixote''. Wordsworth Editions (1997) {{ISBN|9781853267956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lewis Theobald and ''Double Falshood''==
{{main|Double Falsehood}}
In 1727, [[Lewis Theobald]] claimed to have obtained three [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]]-era manuscripts of an unnamed play by Shakespeare, which he edited, "improved", and released under the name ''[[Double Falshood|Double Falshood, or the Distrest Lovers]]''. ''Double Falshood'' has the plot of the "Cardenio" episode in ''Don Quixote''.

It has been suggested that Theobald was unable to publish the original script, because of [[Jacob Tonson]]'s exclusive copyright on Shakespeare's plays. But that contention has been discounted, as the Tonson copyright applied only to the plays he had already published, not to any newly discovered play by Shakespeare; and Theobald edited an edition of the complete works for Tonson, whose commercial interests would have been substantially bettered if he had been able to advertise the edition as containing a hitherto "lost" play. (A prior instance of commercially "enhancing" an edition of Shakespeare's plays by adding new ones was the second reprint of the Third Folio of 1664, which added seven plays, only one of which (''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'') has been accepted as at least partly by Shakespeare.)

The fate of Theobald's three alleged manuscripts is unknown. The very existence of three genuine manuscripts of that age is problematical, and Theobald was said to have invited interested persons to view the alleged manuscript, but he then avoided actually displaying them. These facts have led many scholars to conclude that Theobald's play was a hoax written by himself. However, more recent [[stylometry|stylometric analysis]] may lead to the conclusion that ''Double Falsehood'' was based on one or more manuscripts written in part by Fletcher and in part by another playwright. The open question is whether that second playwright was Shakespeare. The text does not appear to contain many passages that may be even tentatively attributed to Shakespeare, but it is possible that Theobald so heavily edited the text that Shakespeare's style was entirely submerged.

In the late period represented by Shakespeare's known collaborations with Fletcher in ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'' and ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'', his style had become so involved that it is difficult for a listener or even a reader to catch the meanings of many passages on a quick hearing or a first read, so Theobald might have found it necessary to alter the text in a way that made Shakespeare's voice unrecognisable. However historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]] has found an "idiosyncratic" verse in the Theobald adaptation which he believes could only have been written by Shakespeare.&lt;ref name="Wood2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Wood (historian)|title=In Search of Shakespeare|year=2003|publisher=BBC Worldwide|location=London|isbn=0-563-53477-X|pages=201; 315; 330|quote=If Shakespeare does not lie behind that, it is hard to think who else might}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood also asserts that the lyrics of at least one song by Shakespeare's regular collaborator, composer [[Robert Johnson (English composer)|Robert Johnson]], are related to ''Double Falsehood'', indicating that Theobald had access to a genuine original text.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/shakespeare/events/event241.html "1612: The Lost Play"], ''In Search of Shakespeare'' series, PBS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood (2003: 330) The song in question, "Woods, Rocks and Mountains" has survived in a manuscript in Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; As "Double Falsehood" is substantially shorter than any other play of Shakespeare's and is completely lacking in a subplot, which all other Shakespearean plays have, it is likely that one of Theobald's revisions was to remove a subplot from his manuscript version.

In 2010, the [[Arden Shakespeare]] published ''Double Falsehood'' in its series of scholarly editions of Shakespeare's collected works. The editor, Professor Brean Hammond, made a case for the Shakespearean origins of Theobald's play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8569101.stm |title='Lost' Shakespeare play Double Falsehood published |accessdate=16 March 2010 |date=15 March 2010 |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] presented an adaptation of ''Double Falsehood'' as "''Cardenio'', Shakespeare's 'lost play' re-imagined," directed by [[Gregory Doran]]. The critic Michael Billington believes that this version is more suggestive of Fletcher than Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''Cardenio'' – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/apr/28/cardenio-review| last=Billington | first=Michael | authorlink=Michael Billington (critic)| date=28 April 2011| work=The Guardian | page=12| accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Terri Bourus directed a production of [[Gary Taylor (scholar)|Gary Taylor]]'s "unadaptation" of ''Cardenio'', an attempt to reverse Theobald's alterations of the original. Taylor's text along with detailed evidence supporting the view that Theobald had used the original playscript was published in a collection of essays the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Terri Bourus and Gary Taylor, eds. 2013. "The Creation and Re-Creation of Cardenio: Transforming Shakespeare, Transforming Cervantes. Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|9781137344212}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This text subsequently received its UK premiere on 18 March 2017 at the Mary Wallace Theatre, Twickenham in a production by Richmond Shakespeare Society in association with Cutpurse.

==''Double Falsehood'', a synopsis==
The stage play ''Double Falsehood'' varies its tone from that of the episode in the novel and gives the story a fast-moving comic treatment.  This is noted in the preface that Theobald wrote in 1727. All of the characters are given new names for the play:  Don Fernando becomes Henriquez, Cardenio becomes Julio, Luscinda becomes Leonora, Don Bernard is Leonora’s father, and Dorotea becomes Violante.  The play borrows from the novel’s plot events leading to and including the wedding: Henriquez is in love with Leonora, who has planned to wed Julio.  Julio is sent away on an errand, and Leonora is forced to the altar.  She gets a letter to Julio alerting him, he arrives as the wedding is occurring.  The bride has a dagger hidden on her in order to commit suicide.  Julio jumps out from behind a tapestry to stop the wedding, but he is overpowered.  Earlier on, Henriquez has raped Violante, which motivates him, at the end, to marry her in order to make up for his misdeed.  A significant difference between the stage play and the novel, is that the play contains a series of dramatic encounters between the principals that do not occur in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William.

==Charles Hamilton and ''The Second Maiden's Tragedy''==
{{main|The Second Maiden's Tragedy}}
In 1990, handwriting expert [[Charles Hamilton (handwriting expert)|Charles Hamilton]], after seeing a 1611 manuscript known as ''[[The Second Maiden's Tragedy]]'' (usually attributed to [[Thomas Middleton]]), identified it as a text of the missing ''Cardenio'' in which the characters' names had been changed. This attribution has not gained much support among other authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shaksper.net/archive/1994/96-december/2877-re-shakespeares-voices-the-second-maidens-tragedy|title=Unedited comment posted on 'Shaksper; The Global Electronic Shakespeare Conference' website|last=Lavagnino|first=John|date=6 December 1994|accessdate=4 December 2010|quote=The Second Maiden's Tragedy is presented as the work of Middleton alone in the edition of Middleton's works that sixty-three other scholars and I are currently finishing up for publication by Oxford University Press. That view has also been the general consensus for the last fifty years; we haven't found anything in Hamilton's work to make us change our mind.}} Dr Lavagnino co-edited ''The Collected Works of Thomas Middleton'' for the [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Several theatre companies have capitalised on Hamilton's attribution by performing ''The Second Maiden's Tragedy'' under the name of Shakespeare's ''Cardenio''. For instance, a production at [[Oxford]]'s [[Burton Taylor Theatre]] in March 2004, claimed to have been the first performance of the play in England since its putative recovery (although a successful amateur production had premiered at [[Essex University]]'s Lakeside Theatre on 15 October 1998).

A full production of the play, which noted the contested authorship, was mounted at the Next Theatre in [[Evanston, Illinois]] in 1998. Another production of the play, billed as ''William Shakespeare's Cardenio'', was staged by the Lone Star Ensemble in 2002 in Los Angeles, directed by [[James Kerwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jameskerwin.com/cardenio.html|title=James Kerwin: Cardenio|work=jameskerwin.com|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the Aporia Theatre began work on a new edit from translator and director Luis del Aguila and director Jonathan Busby. It was presented under Busby's direction at the [[Warehouse Theatre]], Croydon, in November 2010. Critic [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] believes the play is more suggestive of Middleton than Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Macabre and luridly enjoyable – but no cosmic burst of the Bard|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/nov/08/cardenio-review?INTCMP=SRCH| last=Billington | first=Michael | authorlink=Michael Billington (critic)| date=9 November 2010| work=[[The Guardian]] | page=38| accessdate=12 November 2010|quote=[Hamilton] claimed...that a piece known as The Second Maiden's Tragedy was really the elusive Cardenio; and it is a newly edited version of this – boldly attributed to Shakespeare, Fletcher and a third co-author, Middleton – that is currently being performed in Croydon....the play is more Middleton than Shakespeare.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Second Maiden’s Tragedy'', a synopsis==
The main plot of ''The Second Maiden’s Tragedy'' borrows from Cervantes' novel the events leading up to the wedding ceremony of Luscinda and Don Fernando. The authors of the play create a series of dramatic encounters between (to use the names in the novel) Luscinda and her father, and Luscinda and Don Fernando, Cardenio and Luscinda’s father and Cardenio and Don Fernando.  The wedding does not occur; instead, there is a dramatic scene in which the lusting Don Fernando (The Tyrant) sends his soldiers to grab Luscinda (The Lady).  When The Lady finds out that soldiers will soon arrive and drag her off to Don Fernando’s bed, she asks Cardenio to slay her with his sword.  Cardenio draws his sword, aims it at the breast of the woman he loves, runs at her — and this time it is Cardenio who swoons.  Luscinda picks up the sword and commits suicide.  Her suicide, her dead body, and her ghost, all play a part, as the story hurtles toward a climax of murder and revenge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YHpZAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" The Second Maiden’s Tragedy''].

The '''Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion''' was an [[infantry]] [[battalion]] of the [[Australian Army]] during the [[Second World War]]. Initially raised as a [[Company (military unit)|company]]-sized unit in 1941, it was expanded to a full battalion in 1942 and was unique in that almost all of its enlisted men were [[Torres Strait Islanders]], making the battalion the only [[Indigenous Australian]] battalion ever formed by the Australian Army. The battalion was used mainly in the garrison role, defending the islands of the [[Torres Strait]], although in 1943 a detachment was sent to patrol [[Dutch New Guinea]]. Following the end of the war, the battalion was disbanded in 1946.

==History==
The Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion was initially formed as an independent infantry company of just over 100 men&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1997), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; in May 1941, after the Australian government became concerned about the possibility of conflict in the Pacific and sought to free up other units for service elsewhere.&lt;ref name=battle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anzacday.org.au/history/ww2/bfa/island_defenders.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150317204151/http://www.anzacday.org.au/history/ww2/bfa/island_defenders.html |archivedate=17 March 2015 |title=Island Defenders|last=Seekee|first=Vanessa|publisher=Anzacday.org.au|accessdate=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitment for the company was impacted by the pearling season, but by December 1941 the company was adequately manned and assumed a mobile reserve role; as enlistments continued to grow throughout early 1942 a labour company was also established, eventually adopting the title of the Torres Strait Employment Company.&lt;ref name=McKenzie2264&gt;McKenzie-Smith (2018), p. 2264.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1942, following [[Japan]]'s entry into the war the previous December, the decision was made to expand the unit and an appeal for further volunteers was sent out. The response from the Islanders was considerable, with 830&lt;ref name=AWM&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/about/our-work/publications/wartime/12/ilan-man|title="One ilan man": the Torres Strait Light Infantry|last=Seekee|first=Vanessa|work=Wartime|volume=12|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1997), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Torres Strait Islander men joining the ranks throughout the course of the war—almost every man eligible—a total equal to about one fifth of the population of the [[Torres Strait]] at the time.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s401912.htm|title=Torres Strait Star: AM Archive – Saturday, 27 October 2001|publisher=ABC Radio – AM|accessdate=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a further 40 Torres Strait Malays and Aboriginals were also recruited.&lt;ref name=battle/&gt; By July, the garrison in the Torres Strait was augmented with the arrival of the 14th Garrison Battalion, and the Torres Strait Infantry Company was allocated a reserve role in support of 'B' Company, 14th Garrison Battalion in defence of the [[Horn Island, Queensland|Horn Island]] airfield.&lt;ref name=McKenzie2264/&gt;

The Torres Strait Infantry Company was further expanded by absorbing the employment company,&lt;ref name=McKenzie2264/&gt; and on 1 March 1943, the unit was officially established as a full [[battalion]]&lt;ref name=Dennis4&gt;Dennis et al (2008), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; under the command of Major John Uther (Jock) Swain, with an authorised strength of 17 officers and 470 men.&lt;ref name=Ball34&gt;Ball (1996), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  After receiving full infantry training to the same standard as units of the [[Second Australian Imperial Force|2nd AIF]], the battalion carried out exercises with the [[26th Battalion (Australia)|26th Battalion]] and the [[5th Machine Gun Battalion (Australia)|5th Machine Gun Battalion]] on [[Prince of Wales Island (Queensland)|Prince of Wales Island]].&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; It was organised into four rifle companies, designated 'A' to 'D', and spread out across the Torres Strait, including Horn Island, Goode Island, and [[Thursday Island]], where it formed part of [[Torres Strait Force]]&lt;ref&gt;Ball (1996), p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; and served as an integral part of the Islands' defences against Japanese air raids.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; Later, in May 1943, due to the overwhelming number of recruits, a [[Assault pioneer|pioneer]] company consisting of 160 men was also formed.&lt;ref name=Ball34/&gt;&lt;ref name=battle/&gt; This meant that the battalion could be released from labouring and constructing tasks to focus on defence.&lt;ref name=McKenzie2264/&gt;

Between October to December 1943, a detachment from the battalion was sent to [[Dutch New Guinea]], where they carried out patrol operations in search of Japanese occupation. On 23 December, they were involved in a skirmish with a group of Japanese, during which one member of the battalion was killed and six wounded.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; In mid-1944, the various elements of the battalion were brought together on Thursday Island as it was determined the outposts were no longer needed. At this time the battalion was reorganised, and formed a transportation company, which also took over responsibility for terminal operations and water transport.&lt;ref name=McKenzie2264/&gt;

Due to the racial policies in place at the time, all officers and senior non-commissioned officers were white Australians, while the Torres Strait Islanders originally only received one third of the pay of white soldiers of equal rank.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dennis4/&gt; In response to this and other concerns,  'A', 'B' and 'C' Companies of the battalion briefly went on strike in late December 1943.&lt;ref name=battle/&gt; In February 1944 the Army agreed to increase the soldiers' pay to two-thirds of that of white soldiers. The indigenous soldiers finally received full back pay for their war service in 1986.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dennis4/&gt; Despite the discriminatory pay scales the Islanders generally appreciated the Army's culture, as its discipline and hierarchy allowed them to be treated with respect by white soldiers.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;

The unit was unique, being the only Indigenous Australian battalion ever formed by the Australian Army, and although a number of small [[Irregular military|irregular units]] of Aborigines were formed to provide surveillance of isolated parts of the northern Australian coast, the majority of Indigenous Australians that enlisted during the war served in integrated units, with the exigencies of wartime emergency resulting in significant changes both to official policy and social attitudes on the service of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in the military.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis et al (2008), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Torres Strait Island Light Infantry Battalion represented a significant contribution to the Australian war effort in terms of population, with the majority of able bodied Torres Strait Islander males of military age serving during the war.&lt;ref name=Dennis4/&gt; The battalion was disbanded in 1946, following the end of hostilities. A total 36 members of the battalion died on active service.&lt;ref name=battle/&gt;

'C' Company of the [[Far North Queensland Regiment|51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment (51 FNQR)]] was established in the [[Torres Strait]] in 1987 as a [[Regional Force Surveillance Unit]] (RFSU) responsible for sovereignty patrols in the Torres Strait and providing security to the remote parts of Northern Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://51fnqra.com/unithistory/postwar.html|title=Official Website for the 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment Association|publisher=51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment Association|accessdate=19 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707064848/http://51fnqra.com/unithistory/postwar.html|archivedate=7 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, a number descendents of men who served in the Torres Strait Light Infantry serve within 51 FNQR.&lt;ref name=battle/&gt;

[[Image:IX century text in Old English written by Wulfstan of Hedeby in which Prussians and their customs are mentioned.png|thumb|300px|right|Text of Wulfstan, where [[Old Prussians]] are mentioned. 1859 edition.]]
'''Wulfstan of Hedeby '''(Latin ''Haethum'') was a late ninth century traveller and trader. His travel accounts, as well as those of another trader, [[Ohthere of Hålogaland]], were included in [[Alfred the Great]]'s translation of [[Orosius]]' ''Histories''. It is unclear if Wulfstan was [[England|English]] or indeed if he was from [[Hedeby]], in today's northern [[Germany]] near the [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|city of Schleswig]].

According to this account, Wulfstan undertook a journey by sea from [[Hedeby]] to the [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] trading centre of [[Truso]] around the year 880. He names the lands the coasts he passes.
{{quote|Wulfstan said that he went from [[Hedeby|Haethum]] to [[Truso]] in seven days and nights, and that the ship was running under sail all the way. [[Wends|Weonodland]] was on his right, and [[Langeland|Langland]], [[Lolland|Laeland]], [[Falster]], and [[Scania|Sconey]], on his left, all which land is subject to [[Denmark]]. Then on our left we had the land of the [[Bornholm|Burgundians]], who have a king to themselves.  Then, after the land of the Burgundians, we had on our left the lands that have been called from the earliest times [[Blekinge]]y, and [[Möre|Meore]], and [[Öland|Eowland]], and [[Gotland]], all which territory is subject to the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Sweons]]; and Weonodland (the land of the [[Wends]]) was all the way on our right, as far as [[Vistula|Weissel]]-mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hakluyt|first1=Richard|authorlink1=Richard Hakluyt|editor1-last=Morley|editor1-first=Henry|editor1-link=Henry Morley|title=The Discovery of Muscovy. From the Collections of Richard Hakluyt. With the Voyages of Ohthere and Wulfstan from King Alfred’s Orosius.|date=1893|publisher=[[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell &amp; Company, Ltd]]|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4076/4076-h/4076-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This may be the earliest recorded use of the word "[[Denmark]]" (''Danemearcan''). The text of Wulfstan is also one of the earliest attestments of unique traditions and customs of Western [[Balts]] - [[Old Prussians|Prussians]], called [[Aesti|''Estum'']], and their land called [[Witland]] in his text.

'''Étienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont''' (April 1679 – 1734) was a [[France|French]] explorer who documented his travels on the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and [[Platte River|Platte]] rivers in [[North America]] and made the first European maps of these areas in the early 18th century. He wrote two accounts of his travels, which included descriptions of the Native American tribes he encountered. In 1723, he established [[Fort Orleans]], the first European fort on the Missouri River, near the mouth of the Grand River and present-day [[Brunswick, Missouri]]. In 1724, he led an expedition to the [[Great Plains]] of [[Kansas]] to establish trading relations with the Padouca ([[Apache]] Indians).

==Early life and education==
[[File:Abbaye-Cerisy.png|thumb|200px|left|The abbey at Cerisy where Bourgmont was convicted of poaching and fined 100 livres.  He fled to North America rather than pay the fine.]]
He was born in [[Cerisy-Belle-Étoile]] in central [[Normandy]].  At the age of 19, Bourgmont was found guilty in 1698 of [[poaching]] on the land of the Monastery of Belle-Etoile. He did not pay the 100-[[French livre|livre]]s fine. He is believed to have left for [[New France]] settlements in [[North America]] that year to escape imprisonment for failing to pay the fine.

==Early career in North America==
In 1702 Bourgmont was reported to be with Charles Juchereau de St. Denys and the [[French Marines in Canada, 1683-1715|French Marines in Canada]], who were setting up a [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] for [[American bison|buffalo]] hides at the mouth of the Ouabache River ([[Wabash River]]) on the [[Ohio River]].  The tannery closed in 1703 and Bourgmont moved to [[Quebec]].

In 1705 on orders from [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac]], Bourgmont moved to [[Fort Detroit|Fort Pontchartrain]] at present-day [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], where he assumed command in 1706.  In March 1706 a group of [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]] attacked a group of [[Miami (tribe)|Miami]] outside the fort.  Soldiers fired from the fort and killed a French priest and sergeant who had been outside the walls, in addition to 30 Ottawa. Bourgmont was severely criticized for his handling of the incident. When Cadillac visited the fort in August, Bourgmont and other members of the garrison were reported as having deserted their post.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/jeff/LewisClark2/TheBicentennial/Symposium2002/Papers/Hechenberger_Dan.htm Dan Hechenberger, "Etienne de Véniard sieur de Bourgmont - A timeline"], ''The Lewis and Clark Journey of Discovery'', National Park Service&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:QueenAnnesWarBefore.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A map of the European occupied areas when Bourgmont arrived in North America, ca. 1699.]]
From 1706 to 1709, Bourgmont and other deserters lived as ''[[Coureur des bois|coureurs des bois]]'' (illegal traders, literally, "wood runners") around the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]] and [[Lake Erie]].  In 1709 one of the deserters, Betellemy Pichon, known as ''La Roze,'' was captured.  He testified that two of the deserters had drowned, and that one had been shot and eaten by the starving party.  ''La Roze'' was sentenced to have his "head broken" until he died.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt;

In 1712 Bourgmont returned to Fort Pontchartrain, where he helped the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]], [[Missouria]], and [[Osage (tribe)|Osage]] peoples in their fight against the [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]]. Bourgmont was still an outlaw, subject to arrest.  However, he traveled widely on the frontier and little effort was made to arrest him.  About 1713, Cadillac apparently pardoned him because his knowledge of Indian tribes and territory were of great utility to the French.&lt;ref&gt;Norall, Frank. ''Bourgmont, Explorer of the Missouri, 1698-1725'' Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1988, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consorts, marriages, and families==
[[File:Fort-orleans-return.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Bourgmont's Missouria wife is pictured here on her return from France in 1725.]]
Bourgmont had an affair with a married woman, Madame Tichenet, known as "La Chenette", at Fort Pontchartrain.  After his desertion in 1706, the couple met up and lived among a group of deserters on an island in Lake Erie. La Chenette was the daughter of a French man and an Indian woman.  The couple separated and La Chenette turned up at the English town of [[Albany, New York]] in 1709, where she worked as an interpreter for the governor and lived among the English for 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;Norall, p. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1712, Bourgmont met the daughter of the chief of the [[Missouria]] tribe near Fort Pontchartrain and accompanied her back to the Missouria village at the mouth of the [[Grand River (Missouri)|Grand River]] in Missouri, thus beginning his long-term residence and close relationships with the Missouria. He had children with her, including a son, "le Petit Missouria," born about 1714.  In 1713, Bourgmont and two other traders, also traveling with their Indian wives, visited Illinois.  "He scandalized the missionaries, rattled the authorities, and even angered certain exalted personages at the court of [[Louis XIV]]."  Another order for his arrest came out from [[Paris, France|Paris]], but Cadillac ignored it.&lt;ref&gt;Norall, p. 17, 42&lt;/ref&gt;
   
In May 1721, after returning to Paris and gaining honors for his explorations and reports, Bourgmont married Jacqueline Bouvet des Bordeaux in his home village of Cérisy Belle-Étoile, [[Normandy]]. He left in June to return to New Orleans. In 1725, he accompanied a delegation of four leaders from the Illinois, Missouria, Osage, and Oto tribes on a visit to France. His Missouria wife was also part of the delegation.  While in France, Bourgmont's Missouria wife was baptized and married to Bourgmont's close colleague, Sergeant Dubois, who returned with his new wife and the other Indians to North America. Bourgmont stayed in France, joining his French wife Jacqueline in Normandy. Sergeant Dubois was later killed by Indians and the Missouria woman married a captain of militia.  She was still alive, living in [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]] in 1752.  The fate of Bourgmont's Missouria son is unknown, as the last record of him is in 1724.&lt;ref&gt;Norall, pp. 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bodmer Missouria Otoe Ponca Indians.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Missouria, Otoe, and Ponca Indians.]]
Bourgmont and his French wife, Jacqueline, had four children, all of whom died young. Another women enters the story during Bourgmont's French marriage. In 1728 Marie Angelique, "the Padouca slave" of Bourgmont, was baptized in Cérisy. Four years later, in 1732, she married. She had a six-week-old son who was legitimized by the wedding ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Norall, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hero of the French state==
In 1713 Bourgmont began writing ''Exact Description of Louisiana, of Its Harbors, Lands and Rivers, and Names of the Indian Tribes That Occupy It, and the Commerce and Advantages to Be Derived Therefrom for the Establishment of a Colony.''  In March 1714 he traveled to the mouth of the present-day [[Platte River]] (which he named the ''Rivière Nebraskier'', after the [[Otoe tribe]] name for "flat water").  He wrote ''The Route to Be Taken to Ascend the Missouri River''  This account reached the cartographer [[Guillaume Delisle]], who noted that it was the first documented report of travels that far north on the Missouri.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville]] replaced Cadillac as commandant.  On September 25, 1718, he recommended that Bourgmont receive the [[Order of Saint Louis|Cross of Saint Louis]] for service to France, for the value of his explorations and documentation of river travel.  In September 1719, the Council of the Colony of Louisiana also recognized Bourgmont's work with Native Americans with a resolution of praise.

Bourgmont described his knack for dealing with the tribes:

:For me with the Indians nothing is impossible.  I make them do what they have never done.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN080185959X&amp;id=edYbAZ7ECEoC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;ots=U8AqDiyvSW&amp;dq=%C3%89tienne+de+Veniard,+Sieur+de+Bourgmont&amp;sig=p3oqqluq8HtNCcA-UXaI0Xhqni4 Colin Gordon Calloway, ''New Worlds for All: Indians, Europeans, and the Remaking of Early America''], Marie Angelique {{ISBN|0-8018-5959-X}}, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tribes were said to have valued the products Bourgmont offered, as he traded gunpowder, guns, kettles, and blankets. The Spanish were said to trade few horses, knives, and "inferior axes."
&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0803264658&amp;id=4wD5wFxej-UC&amp;pg=RA1-PA260&amp;lpg=RA1-PA260&amp;ots=MT5GVMY7uw&amp;dq=%C3%89tienne+de+Veniard,+Sieur+de+Bourgmont&amp;sig=Fy0ipx10nGrtIb2Oh2OUKFh_tPw Colin G. Calloway, ''One Vast Winter Count: The Native American West Before Lewis And Clark''] {{ISBN|0-8032-1530-4}}, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials sent Bourgmont to bring the chiefs of several tribes to [[Dauphin Island]], a French base in present-day [[Alabama]], for a meeting. All of the chiefs except one died ''en route''.  Bourgmont escorted the surviving chief back to his homeland and then returned to the (new) settlement of [[New Orleans]].  He was paid 4,279 livres for his work.

In June 1720 he and his [[Métis in the United States|Métis]] son traveled to [[Paris]], where they were greeted as heroes.  News had arrived that Native American tribes friendly to Bourgmont had defeated the Spanish [[Villasur expedition]].  In July Bourgmont was commissioned as a captain in the French army.  In August 1720 he was named "Commandant of the Missouri River."  In exchange for Letters of Nobility, he was commissioned to build a fort on the Missouri River and negotiate with the tribes to allow peaceful French commerce.

==Expedition to the Great Plains==
Bourgmont established [[Fort Orleans]] in early 1723 as the military headquarters for the Missouri River.  From Fort Orleans, near the mouth of the Grand River, he planned to visit the ''Padouca'' on the [[Great Plains]] and open a trade route to reach the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] colony in [[New Mexico]] (larger than the current state). Bourgmont sought aid from the [[Kaw (tribe)|Kaw]] to facilitate his expedition.  He sent 22 Frenchmen and Canadians by boat from Fort Orleans to the Kaw village on the Missouri near [[Doniphan, Kansas]] with supplies and gifts.  Accompanied by 10 French colonists, 100 Missouri and 64 Osage, he traveled by land.&lt;ref&gt;Norall, pp 51-67.  Details about the expedition to the Plains are from Norall unless otherwise noted&lt;/ref&gt; Bourgmont's visit to the Kaw was the first official French visit, although many French traders, including he, had visited them during the previous 20 years.  Some of the Kaw had also likely journeyed to trade in [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], a French colonial village then on the east side of the Mississippi in present-day Illinois.         
	
Bourgmont's party reached the Kaw village on July 8, 1724.  It was large, with at least 1,500 persons.&lt;ref&gt;Unrau, William E. ''The Kansa Indians: A History of the Wind People, 1673-1873''.  Norman: U of OK Press, 1971, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kaw greeted him as an old colleague, honoring him with innumerable speeches and feasts.  When the talk turned to trade, the Kaw were hard bargainers. Bourgmont wanted to buy horses from them. With only five horses to trade, they extracted a high price.  This indicates that horses were still rare on the eastern border of the Plains. The Kaw also traded six [[slaves]] (likely American Indians of other tribes captured in battle), food, furs, and skins. On July 24, Bourgmont, his party of French, Missouri, and Osage, and most of the Kaw left on their expedition to visit the Padouca.

Due to the heat, Bourgmont became ill, and the entire party of over 1,000 people returned to the Kaw village.  Bourgmont sent an emissary ahead to contact the Padouca and tell them he would soon be coming, and that he would bring two Padouca slaves to be returned to the tribe as an expression of good will.  Bourgmont's emissary found the Padouca in western Kansas, most likely in the region of the [[El Quartelejo Ruins|Quartelejo]] in [[Scott County, Kansas|Scott County]].  It had become a refuge for Indians fleeing the Spanish in New Mexico. Eight villages with about 600 men in total lived in the area.  They agreed to relocate closer to the Kaw village in order to meet Bourgmont when he was able to resume his journey.  Five Padouca returned to the Kaw village as guides.

Recovered from his illness, on October 8 Bourgmont resumed his journey to the Padouca.  His party was much smaller and more nimble: 15 French and [[Métis]], including Bourgmont's half-Missouria son; the five Padoucas, seven Missouria, five Kaw, four [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]], and three [[Iowa tribe|Iowa]].  The Osage were not recorded as part of this smaller expedition.  Ten horses carried the baggage.  The party proceeded southwest and on October 11 at the crossing of the [[Kansas River]], near present-day [[Rossville, Kansas|Rossville]], Bourgmont recorded seeing [[bison|buffalo]]. The expedition passed through innumerable buffalo, a hunter's paradise. They recorded 30 herds in one day, each herd consisting of 400-500 buffalo. Bourgmont wrote, "Our hunters kill as many as they please."&lt;ref&gt;Norall, 148&lt;/ref&gt;  Deer were also abundant. In one day they saw more than 200, plus numerous turkeys near the streams.

===The Padouca===
On October 18, Bourgmont encountered the Padouca.  Eighty of the Padouca rode out on horses to meet the French and took them back to the camp.  The number of horses indicates that the Padouca at this time held more horses than did the Kaw and the other Indians living further east.  The identity of the people whom Bourgmont met with has been much debated by historians.  The French later referred to the ''[[Comanche]]'' as Padouca.  Most historians and anthropologists have come to agree that Bourgmont’s Padouca were likely the ''[[Apache]]'' Indians.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Bird Grinnell|Grinnell, George Bird]] “Who Were the Padouca?”, ''American Anthropologist'', Vol. 23, No. 3, June-Sept 1920, pp. 247-260&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourgmont was given an honored welcome. With his son and two other French explorers, he was seated on a buffalo robe; they were carried to the tent (tipi?) of the Padouca chief for a great feast.  The next day Bourgmont assembled his trade goods and divided them into lots.  The following is the list: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"one pile of fusils [guns], one of sabers, one of pickaxes, one of axes, one of gunpowder, one of balls, one of red [[Limbourg]] cloth, another of blue Limbourg cloth, one of mirrors, one of Flemish knives, two other piles of another kind of knives, one of shirts, one of scissors, one of combs, one of gunflints, one of wadding extractors, six portions of [[vermilion|vermillion]], one lot of awls, one of large hawk beads, one of beads of mixed sizes, one of small beans, one of fine brass wire, another of heavier brass wire for making necklaces, another of rings, and another of vermillion cases."&lt;ref name="Norall, 151"&gt;Norall, 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  The Padouca (or Apache) had never seen such a variety of European goods.  They were frightened of the guns.&lt;ref&gt;Norall, 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourgmont assembled 200 of the Apache chiefs and discussed the need for peace among all tribes.  He implored them to allow the French traders to pass through their lands ''en route'' to the Spanish settlements in New Mexico. Next, he invited the chiefs to take what they wanted of the merchandise.

He estimated that the village contained 140 dwellings, about 800 men, more than 1,500 women, and about 2,000 children.  The imbalance between men and women indicates that the life of an Apache man was hazardous.&lt;ref name="Norall, 151"/&gt; The dwellings were large enough to house 30 people to live in each.  The Apache chief said that he had twelve villages under his control and together four times the number of people as in this village, or about 16,000. The Apache lived in a large territory extending more than 200 leagues (520 miles).

Bourgmont wrote that the Apache maintained permanent villages.  They sent out regular hunting parties, in groups of 50-100 households. As one hunting party returned, another would leave, so that the village was occupied at all times.  They apparently journeyed up to five or six days from their village to hunt. The Apache sowed a little corn and pumpkins.  They obtained tobacco and horses from trade with the Spanish in New Mexico, in exchange for tanned buffalo skins.  It is unclear whether the Spanish ventured out on the plains to visit the Apache villages, or whether the Apaches traveled to the Spanish settlements.  The latter seems more likely, although Spaniards may have gone out occasionally to meet the Apache who lived relatively near to their settlements. The explorer noticed that the Apache living furthest from the Spanish settlements still used flint knives for skinning buffalo and felling trees, an indicator that not much European trade had reached them.

The Apache were hospitable; they feasted and fêted Bourgmont and his group for three days before the French party turned toward home on October 22.  By October 31, Bourgmont had reached the Kaw village again.  Traveling down the Missouri in circular "bullboats", made of buffalo hides stretched over a framework of saplings, the party reached Fort Orleans on November 5.&lt;ref&gt;Norall, 160-161&lt;/ref&gt;  Bourgmont thought his expedition had been successful, but little came of it.  Within about a decade, the Apache whom he had met in Kansas were gone, pushed south by an aggressive tribe migrating from the Rocky Mountains and sweeping all before them: the [[Comanche]].

==The location of the Padouca==

Scholars examining documents and geography have determined that the Apache village was probably located on the [[Little Arkansas River]] near [[Lyons, Kansas]]—the same location where [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado]] had found ''[[Quivira]]'' 173 years earlier while hunting for tribes with gold.&lt;ref&gt;Reichart, Milton “Bourgmont’s Route to Central Kansas: A Reexamination.” ''Kansas History'', Vol 2, Summer 1979, pp. 96-120&lt;/ref&gt; But, the [[Wichita (tribe)|Wichita Indians]], whom Coronado met in ''Quivira,'' were no longer there.  It appears that they had been pushed south and east by the Apache, who, in their turn, would be pushed south by the Comanche.

==Return to France==
[[File:AmCyc Park - Fontainebleau — View from the Château.jpg|thumb|right|200px|King Louis XV entertained Bourgmont and the Indian chiefs at Fontainebleau in 1725.]]
In 1725 Bourgmont was authorized to invite and accompany representatives of the tribes to Paris.  The chiefs were to be shown the wonders and power of France, including a visit to [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], [[Château de Marly]]  and [[Fontainebleau]], hunting in the royal forest with [[Louis XV]], and seeing an [[opera]].  His Missouria wife was listed officially as a servant.

In late 1725 the tribes' leaders and his Missouria wife returned to North America.  Bourgemont stayed in Normandy with his French wife, where he had been elevated to ''écuyer'' ([[squire]]).

The French did not continue to support Fort Orleans, and it was abandoned in 1726.  Bourgmont died in France in 1734.
