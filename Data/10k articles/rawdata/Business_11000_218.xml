'''Adolph Herman Joseph Coors Sr.''' (born '''Adolph Hermann Josef Kuhrs''' or some variant thereof){{clarify|date=September 2015}} (February 4, 1847 &amp;ndash; June 5, 1929) was a German American brewer who founded the [[Adolph Coors Company]] in [[Golden, Colorado]], in 1873.

==Early years==
Adolph Kohrs was born in [[Barmen]] in [[Rhine Province|Rhenish Prussia]] on February 4, 1847, the son of Joseph Kohrs (c.1820–1862) and Helena Heim (c.1820–1862). He was apprenticed at age thirteen to the book and stationery store of Andrea &amp; Company in nearby [[Ruhrort]] from November 1860 until June 1862. His mother died on April 2, 1862. The Kohrs family moved to [[Dortmund]], [[Westphalia]]. In July 1862, Adolph was apprenticed for a three-year period at a [[brewery]] owned by Henry Wenker in Dortmund. He was charged a fee for his apprenticeship, so he worked as a bookkeeper to pay for it. His father died on November 24, 1862. Orphaned, Adolph completed his apprenticeship and continued to work as a paid employee at the Wenker Brewery until May 1867. He then worked at breweries in [[Kassel]], [[Berlin]], and [[Uelzen]] in Germany.

Early in 1868, he came to the [[United States]] as an undocumented stowaway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Coors Brewery Tours in Golden CO MillerCoors|url = http://visitgolden.com/coors-brewery-beer-tours/coors-brewery-tours-history|accessdate = 2015-08-22|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150710111503/http://visitgolden.com/coors-brewery-beer-tours/coors-brewery-tours-history|archivedate = 2015-07-10|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He sailed from [[Hamburg]] to [[New York City]] and then moved to [[Chicago]] arriving on May 30, 1868. His name was changed from "Kohrs" to "Coors". He worked in the spring as a laborer, and during the summer he worked as a [[brewer]]. In the fall and winter he worked as a [[Fireman (steam engine)|fireman]], loading coal into the firebox of a steam engine. In the spring and summer of 1869, he worked as an apprentice [[bricklayer]] and a stone cutter. He became foreman of John Stenger's brewery on August 11, 1869, in [[Naperville, Illinois]], about 35 miles west of [[Chicago]].

He resigned from Stenger's brewery on January 22, 1872, and moved to [[Denver]], arriving in April. He worked in Denver as a gardener for a month, and on May 1, 1872, he purchased a partnership in the bottling firm of John Staderman. In the same year, he bought and assumed control of the entire business.&lt;ref&gt;An advertisement in Corbett, Hoye &amp; Company's ''Directory of the City of Denver'' (1873) on page 242 showed Adolph Coors as a dealer in "bottled beer, ale, porter and cider, imported and domestic wines, and seltzer water." His place of business was located in the Tappan Block on Holladay (now Market) Street between E and F streets (now 14th and 15th). The same directory shows that Coors lived on Curtis Street between IC and L (20th and 21st) streets.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Golden Brewery==
On November 14, 1873, Coors and the Denver confectioner Jacob Schueler purchased the abandoned Golden City Tannery and converted it to the Golden Brewery. By February 1874, they were producing beer for sale. In 1880, Coors purchased Schueler's interest, and the brewery was renamed Adolph Coors Golden Brewery.&lt;ref name="Oliver2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Garrett Oliver|title=The Oxford Companion to Beer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gYVLHMmplRcC&amp;pg=PA100|date=9 September 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536713-3|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Prohibition]] began in Colorado in 1916, he converted his brewery to make malted milk. The company also manufactured porcelain and ceramic products made from clay mined in Golden. The Coors Porcelain division has since split off, and is now known as [[CoorsTek]].

==Marriage and family==

===Immediate family===
On April 12, 1879, Adolph Coors married Louisa Webber, the daughter of the superintendent of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad maintenance shops.  They were married at the Coors home on the brewery grounds.  Adolph and Louisa raised three sons and three daughters to adulthood, with two children dying in infancy.  Louise was born on March 2, 1880, and was nicknamed Lulu among her many friends.  Their second child was Augusta, born in 1881, and known by her nickname of Gussie.  The fifth born and third surviving child was [[Adolph Coors II|Adolph Coors Jr.]], on January 12, 1884.  Bertha Coors was born on June 24, 1886, and Grover C. Coors was born in 1888.  The last addition to the family, Herman Frederick Coors, was born on July 24, 1890, while the family was on vacation in [[Berlin]].

All of the daughters attended the [[Wolcott School for Girls]] in Denver.  Louise married Henry F. Kugeler at the Coors Mansion, and Augusta married Herbert E. Collbran there on October 5, 1905.  At the time, ''Transcript'' editor George West wrote, "Miss Coors is a native Golden girl and proud of it.  She is pretty and talented, and by her universally pleasant and courteous demeanor has endeared herself to all the people of her native town."  She and her husband moved to [[Korea]], where his father was the nation's transportation adviser; Herbert Collbran held an important position with the governmental railways. It is possible that the advent of international shipping of Coors beer, which began in Korea in 1908, was directly related to the family's presence there.

Adolph Jr., Grover and Herman all graduated from [[Cornell University]], and returned to Denver to take positions in the family operations.  Adolph Jr. was married to Alice May Kistler at the Kistler home, and the family lived in Denver.  Grover married Gertrude at the Coors Mansion.  Bertha, who became an accomplished equestrienne and [[safari]] hunter, married Harold S. Munroe on January 8, 1911, at the Coors Mansion.  The couple moved to [[Mexico]] where Harold worked in gold mining operations.  Herman Coors married Doreathea Clara Morse on May 25, 1916, in [[Tompkins, New York]]. {Two Hermans?} Herman Coors married Janet Ferrin and stayed in Golden, and worked in the family's porcelain manufacturing operations.  In 1926, he moved to [[Inglewood, California]], where he set up his own porcelain plant, the [[CoorsTek#Rosebud china and Prohibition after WW1|H.F. Coors China Company]].

===Siblings===
Adolph Coors is known to have had at least two siblings, a sister and younger brother, William Kuhrs, who was born in [[Dortmund, Germany]] in 1849.  William followed his brother to America in 1870 and took the same respelling of the family name.  He made his way to Chicago where he made a good living as a cabinet maker, and arrived in Golden by the mid-1870s.  He took a good position of employment at his brother's brewery, in which employ he remained for the rest of his life.  Following further in his brother's footsteps, William married Louisa's sister Mary in 1881, and ten years later moved to [[Denver]] where he had charge of the Coors interests in that city.  The couple had three daughters, two of whom were Mattie and Helena.  William Coors died on December 30, 1923, and is buried at the Golden Cemetery.  Upon his death the ''[[Golden Transcript|Colorado Transcript]]'' described him as "a genial, accommodating man, and had many friends in Golden, Denver and elsewhere."  His oldest daughter married William J. Gilbert and the second married Charles Nitschke.

==Death==
On June 5, 1929, Adolph Coors committed suicide by leaping from a sixth-floor hotel window.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coastalvirginiamag.com/January-2015/Strange-Brew/ Rich Griset, "Strange Brew"], ''Coastal Virginia Magazine'', January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Brewing Beer and Problems|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/business/0007shelf.html|quote=In "Citizen Coors: An American Dynasty" (William Morrow, $27), Dan Baum wisely singles the family out. Mr. Baum builds a strong narrative from the tale of how this big [[dysfunctional family]] made a lot of cold beer and money that ultimately financed conservative causes via the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Heritage Foundation]]. There is no lack of drama, starting with the patriarch Adolph Coors, who committed suicide by jumping out of a hotel window.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 7, 2000|accessdate=2007-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13027">'''Agricultural biotechnology''', also known as '''agritech''', is an area of [[agricultural science]] involving the use of scientific tools and techniques, including [[genetic engineering]], [[molecular markers]], [[molecular diagnostics]], [[vaccines]], and [[tissue culture]], to modify living organisms: plants, animals, and [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://absp2.cornell.edu/resources/briefs/documents/warp_briefs_eng_scr.pdf | title=What is Agricultural Biotechnology? | publisher=Cornell University | accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Crop biotechnology is one aspect of agricultural biotechnology which has been greatly developed upon in recent times. Desired trait are exported from a particular species of Crop to an entirely different species. These [[transgene]] crops possess desirable characteristics in terms of flavor, color of flowers, growth rate, size of harvested products and resistance to diseases and pests.

== History ==
Farmers have manipulated plants and animals through selective breeding for tens of thousands of years in order to create desired traits. In the 20th century, a surge in technology resulted in an increase in agricultural biotechnology through the selection of traits like increased yield, pest resistance, [[drought resistance]], and herbicide resistance. The first food product produced through [[biotechnology]] was sold in 1990, and by 2003, 7 million farmers were utilizing biotech crops. More than 85% of these farmers were located in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://absp2.cornell.edu/resources/briefs/documents/warp_briefs_eng_scr.pdf|title=Agricultural Biotechnology|last=|first=|date=2004|website=cornell.edu|publisher=PBS, ABSP II, US Agency for International Development|access-date=1 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crop modification techniques ==

=== Traditional breeding ===
Traditional [[crossbreeding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.biofortified.org/portfolio/infographic-crop-modification-techniques/|title=Infographic: Crop Modification Techniques - Biology Fortified, Inc.|newspaper=Biology Fortified, Inc.|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been used for centuries to improve crop quality and quantity. Crossbreeding mates two sexually compatible species to create a new variety with the desired traits of the parents. For example, the [[honeycrisp apple]] exhibits a specific texture and flavor due to the crossbreeding of its parents.  In traditional practices, pollen from one plant is placed on the female part of another, which leads to a hybrid that contains genetic information from both parent plants. Plant breeders select the plants with the traits they're looking to pass on and continue to breed those plants. Note that crossbreeding can only be utilized within the same or closely related species.

=== Mutagenesis ===
[[Mutation]]s can occur randomly in the [[DNA]] of any organism. In order to create variety within crops, scientists can randomly induce mutations within plants. [[Mutation breeding|Mutagenesis]] uses radioactivity to induce random mutations in the hopes of stumbling upon the desired trait. Scientists can use [[mutagen|mutating chemical]]s such as [[ethyl methanesulfonate]], or radioactivity to create random mutations within the DNA. [[Atomic gardening|Atomic gardens]] are used to mutate crops. A radioactive core is located in the center of a circular garden and raised out of the ground to radiate the surrounding crops, generating mutations within a certain radius. Mutagenesis through radiation was the process used to produce [[ruby red grapefruit]]s.

=== Polyploidy ===
[[Polyploidy]] can be induced to modify the number of chromosomes in a crop in order to influence its fertility or size. Usually, organisms have two sets of [[chromosome]]s, otherwise known as a [[diploidy]]. However, either naturally or through the use of chemicals, that number of chromosomes can change, resulting in fertility changes or size modification within the crop. Seedless watermelons are created in this manner; a 4-set chromosome watermelon is crossed with a 2-set chromosome watermelon to create a [[Seedless fruit|sterile (seedless) watermelon]] with three sets of chromosomes.

=== Protoplast fusion ===
[[Protoplast fusion]] is the joining of cells or cell components to transfer traits between species.  For example, the trait of male sterility is transferred from radishes to red cabbages by protoplast fusion. This male sterility helps plant breeders make hybrid crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Beuckeleer|first=Mariani|last2=De Beuckeleer|first2=Celestina|last3=De Beuckeleer|first3=Marc|last4=Truettner|first4=Jessie|last5=Leemans|first5=Jan|last6=Goldberg|first6=Robert|year=1990|title=Induction of Male Sterility in Plants by a Chimaeric Ribonuclease Gene.|url=|journal=Nature|volume=437.6295|pages=737–41|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RNA interference ===
[[RNA interference]] (RNAIi) is the process in which a cell's [[RNA]] to protein mechanism is turned down or off in order to suppress genes. This method of genetic modification works by interfering with messenger RNA to stop the synthesis of proteins, effectively silencing a gene.

=== Transgenics ===
[[Transgenics]] involves the insertion of one piece of DNA into another organism's DNA in order to introduce a new gene(s) into the original organism. This addition of genes into an organism's genetic material creates a new variety with desired traits.  The DNA must be prepared and packaged in a test tube and then inserted into the new organism. New genetic information can be inserted with [[biolistics]]. An example of transgenics is the rainbow papaya, which is modified with a gene that gives it resistance to the [[papaya ringspot virus]].

=== Genome editing ===
[[Genome editing]] is the use of an enzyme system to modify the DNA directly within the cell. Genome editing was used to develop herbicide resistant canola to help farmers control weeds.

== Improved nutritional content ==
Agricultural biotechnology has been used to improve the nutritional content of a variety of crops in an effort to meet the needs of an increasing population.  Genetic engineering can produce crops with a higher concentration of vitamins. For example, [[golden rice]] contains three genes that allow plants to produce compounds that are converted to [[vitamin A]] in the human body. This nutritionally improved rice is designed to combat the world's leading cause of blindness—[[vitamin A deficiency]]. Similarly, the Banana 21 project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.banana21.org/about.html|title=About Banana21|website=www.banana21.org|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; has worked to improve the nutrition in bananas to combat [[micronutrient deficiencies]] in Uganda. By genetically modifying bananas to contain vitamin A and iron, Banana 21 has helped foster a solution to micronutrient deficiencies through the vessel of a staple food and major starch source in Africa. Additionally, crops can be engineered to reduce toxicity or to produce varieties with removed [[allergen]]s.

== Genes and traits of interest for crops ==

=== Agronomic traits ===

==== Insect resistance ====

One highly sought after trait is [[pest resistance|insect resistance]]. This trait increases a crop's resistance to bugs and allows for a higher yield. These genetically engineered crops can now produce their own Bt (''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]''), which contains toxin-producing proteins that are non-harmful to humans. [[Bt corn]] and cotton are now commonplace, and cowpeas, sunflower, soybeans, tomatoes, tobacco, walnut, sugar cane, and rice are all being studied in relation to Bt.

==== Herbicide tolerance ====

Weeds have proven to be an issue for farmers for thousands of years; they compete for soil nutrients, water, and sunlight and prove deadly to crops. Biotechnology has offered a solution in the form of herbicide tolerance. Chemical herbicides are sprayed directly on plants in order to kill weeds and therefore competition, and [[herbicide resistant]] crops have to the opportunity to flourish.

==== Disease resistance ====

Often, crops are afflicted by disease spread through insects (like [[aphid]]s). Spreading disease among crop plants is incredibly difficult to control and was previously only managed by completely removing the affected crop. The field of agricultural biotechnology offers a solution through genetically engineering virus resistance. Developing GE disease-resistant crops now include [[cassava]], [[maize]], and [[sweet potato]].

==== Temperature tolerance ====

Agricultural biotechnology can also provide a solution for plants in extreme temperature conditions. In order to maximize yield and prevent crop death, genes can be engineered that help to regulate cold and heat tolerance. For example, papaya trees have been genetically modified in order to be more tolerant of hot and cold conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Figueroa-Yañez|first=Luis|last2=Pereira-Santana|first2=Alejandro|last3=Arroyo-Herrera|first3=Ana|last4=Rodriguez-Corona|first4=Ulises|last5=Sanchez-Teyer|first5=Felipe|last6=Espadas-Alcocer|first6=Jorge|last7=Espadas-Gil|first7=Francisco|last8=Barredo-Pool|first8=Felipe|last9=Castaño|first9=Enrique|date=2016-10-20|title=RAP2.4a Is Transported through the Phloem to Regulate Cold and Heat Tolerance in Papaya Tree (Carica papaya cv. Maradol): Implications for Protection Against Abiotic Stress|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165030|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=10|pages=e0165030|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0165030|issn=1932-6203|pmc=5072549|pmid=27764197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other traits include water use efficiency, nitrogen use efficiency and salt tolerance.

=== Quality traits ===
Quality traits include increased nutritional or dietary value, improved food processing and storage, or the elimination of toxins and allergens in crop plants.

== Common GMO crops ==
Currently, only a small number of [[genetically modified crops]] are available for purchase and consumption in the United States. The USDA has approved soybeans, corn, canola, sugar beets, papaya, squash, alfalfa, cotton, apples, and potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mvgs.iaea.org/|title=MVD|website=mvgs.iaea.org|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; GMO apples ([[arctic apples]]) are non-browning apples and eliminate the need for anti-browning treatments, reduce food waste, and bring out flavor. The production of Bt cotton has skyrocketed in India, with 10 million hectares planted for the first time in 2011, resulting in a 50% insecticide application reduction. In 2014, Indian and Chinese farmers planted more than 15 million hectares of Bt cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org|title=International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications - ISAAA.org|website=www.isaaa.org|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety testing and government regulations ==
Agricultural biotechnology regulation in the US falls under three main government agencies: The [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). The USDA must approve the release of any new GMOs, EPA controls the regulation of insecticide, and the FDA evaluates the safety of a particular crop sent to market. On average, it takes nearly 13 years and $130 million of research and development for a [[genetically modified organism]] to come to market. The regulation process takes up to 8 years in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gmo.geneticliteracyproject.org/FAQ/what-does-it-take-to-bring-a-new-gm-product-to-market/|title=What does it take to bring a new GM product to market? #GMOFAQ|newspaper=GMO FAQ|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The safety of GMOs has become a topic of debate worldwide, but scientific articles are being conducted to test the safety of consuming GMOs in addition to the FDA's work. In one such article, it was concluded that Bt rice did not adversely affect digestion and did not induce horizontal gene transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Kai|last2=Ren|first2=Fangfang|last3=Han|first3=Fangting|last4=Liu|first4=Qiwen|last5=Wu|first5=Guogan|last6=Xu|first6=Yan|last7=Zhang|first7=Jian|last8=Wu|first8=Xiao|last9=Wang|first9=Jinbin|date=2016-10-05|title=Edible Safety Assessment of Genetically Modified Rice T1C-1 for Sprague Dawley Rats through Horizontal Gene Transfer, Allergenicity and Intestinal Microbiota|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0163352|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=10|pages=e0163352|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0163352|issn=1932-6203|pmc=5051820|pmid=27706188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Seropian''' (born 1969)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=6&amp;ti=1,6&amp;Search_Arg=Operation%20%3A%20Desert%20Storm&amp;Search_Code=TALL&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=HSGyqup0-h60mInWxilDd-XWaE&amp;SEQ=20110507164024&amp;SID=14|title=Copyright Catalog: Operation : Desert Storm|publisher=[[United States Copyright Office]]|date=1991-06-17|accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[video game developer]], one of the initial founders and later president of [[Bungie]], the developer of the ''[[Marathon (video game)|Marathon]]'', ''[[Myth (series)|Myth]]'', and ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' video game series. Seropian became interested in computer programming in college and teamed up with fellow student [[Jason Jones (programmer)|Jason Jones]] to publish Jones's game ''[[Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete]]''. The two became partners, and Bungie grew to become the best-known [[Apple Macintosh]] game developer before being bought by Microsoft in 2001.

In 2004, Seropian left Bungie and created [[Wideload Games]], with the goal of streamlining game development. Wideload's small core development team worked with outside contractors to produce ''[[Stubbs the Zombie]]'' and ''[[Hail to the Chimp]]''. Wideload was acquired by Disney in 2009. As part of the deal Seropian became vice president of game development for [[Disney Interactive Studios]]. In 2012 he left the position to start [[Industrial Toys]], a company focusing on mobile games.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Alex Seropian attended the [[University of Chicago]], and joined the [[Phi Delta Theta]] fraternity, where he met one of his future colleagues [[Jason Jones (programmer)|Jason Jones]]. Interested in [[computer programming]], Seropian was pursuing a mathematics degree with a concentration in computer science as the Department of Computer Science did not offer undergraduate degrees at the time. He graduated in 1991 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics. Before graduating, Seropian was living with his father, sleeping on his couch, and debating whether to get a job or create his own video game company. Seropian's father advised him to take a job to get experience, but the next day Seropian decided to found his own company. "My dad is a master of reverse psychology", Seropian said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Recchie, Benjamin|date=Fall–Winter 2008|url=http://thecore.uchicago.edu/fallwinter08/got_game.shtml|title=They've Got Game; Tom Kang, AB'88, and Alex Seropian, SB'91, take video gaming beyond swordplay and shoot-'em-up|work=The Core|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|accessdate=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bungie===
Seropian's first game was a self-published ''[[Pong]]''-clone called ''[[Gnop!]]'' for [[Apple Macintosh]]. The game was free, although a few customers paid $15 for the game's source code. In 1991 he founded Bungie and published his first commercial game, ''[[Operation Desert Storm (video game)|Operation Desert Storm]]''. Seropian sold 2,500 copies of the game, assembling the game boxes and mailing them out from his bedroom.&lt;ref name="gamesradar-history of halo"&gt;{{cite web|author=Xbox World 360 |date=2007-10-08 |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-history-of-halo/a-2007100812649684036 |title=The History of Halo; How two students went from Pong clones to the biggest game of all time |publisher=[[GamesRadar]] |pages=1–4 |accessdate=2009-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123041945/http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-history-of-halo/a-2007100812649684036 |archivedate=2008-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seropian partnered with his Artificial Intelligence classmate [[Jason Jones (programmer)|Jason Jones]] to publish Jones's nearly complete ''[[Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete]]''; the game sold around 2,500 copies—it required a then-rare modem for network play&lt;ref name="gamesradar-history of halo"/&gt;—it developed a devoted following. After publishing ''Minotaur'', the two formed a partnership.&lt;ref name="bungie-primordial soup gnop"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |date= |url=http://www.bungie.net/inside/history.aspx?link=HistoryOfBungie_p1 |title=Bungie History: Primordial Soup—Gnop! |publisher=[[Bungie]] |accessdate=2009-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929043305/http://www.bungie.net/inside/history.aspx?link=HistoryOfBungie_p1 |archivedate=2009-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next Bungie title, 1993's ''[[Pathways Into Darkness]]'', Seropian hired a third team member for graphics work. The game was the first three-dimensional [[texture mapping|texture-mapped]] game on the Mac and the first true [[first-person shooter]].&lt;ref name="gamesradar-history of halo"/&gt; By 1994 Bungie had grown to a staff of six and had moved into a rundown Chicago office&lt;ref name="gamesradar-history of halo"/&gt;—a converted former religious school located in front of a [[crack house]].&lt;ref name="bungie-pathways"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |date= |url=http://www.bungie.net/inside/history.aspx?link=pathways |title=Bungie History: Primordial Soup—Pathways |publisher=[[Bungie]] |accessdate=2009-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426200338/http://www.bungie.net/inside/history.aspx?link=pathways |archivedate=2008-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their next title, ''[[Marathon (video game)|Marathon]]'', began development as a sequel to ''Pathways'' but grew larger. On release it won several awards and established Bungie as the top Mac game developer.&lt;ref name="gamesradar-history of halo"/&gt;

For ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', Seropian noted that the company had to incorporate new features such as surround sound and cinematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/features/view.php?ID=93|title=Interview: Bungie's Alexander Seropian|publisher=[[Inside Mac Games]]|date=2001-12-10|accessdate=2008-04-26|first=Tuncer |last=Deniz| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080501062839/http://www.insidemacgames.com/features/view.php?ID=93| archivedate= 1 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Halo'' went on to sell more than 4&amp;nbsp;million units by 2004 and founded a media franchise encompassing sequels, books, and music. Seropian left Bungie in 2002 to spend time with his new family, but also due to frustrations with the game development process.&lt;ref name="cnn-return of innovation"&gt;{{cite news|author=Morris, Chris|date=2004-09-26|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/04/23/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/|title=The return of innovation? Wave of veteran game developers launch their own studio|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wideload Games===
Seropian founded his own studio in 2004 called [[Wideload Games]], intended to be more streamlined than most video game studios. Calling the method of game development "broken", Wideload began with a staff of 10, with the plan to outsource the lion's share of development, to stay within budget.&lt;ref name="gamesindustry.biz-wideload creation"&gt;{{cite web|author=Fahey, Rob|date=2004-04-26|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/bungie-founder-creates-new-studio-starts-work-on-pcxbox-title|title=Bungie founder creates new studio, starts work on PC/Xbox title|publisher=[[Gamesindustry.biz]]|accessdate=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seropian said that the idea came from figuring out that his decade-old assumptions about how to make games did not necessarily apply to the future.&lt;ref name="ign-wideload interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/509/509117p1.html|title=Wideload Interview|publisher=IGN|date=2004-04-26|accessdate=2008-04-26|first=Steve |last=Butts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seropian turned to the film industry for cues, saying that it helped to look at an older industry that had been solving the same types of problems for a longer period than video games.&lt;ref name="gamasutra-why seropian sold"/&gt; The external development model allowed Wideload to focus on the creative aspect of a project and added flexibility in what types of projects the team could take on.&lt;ref name="ign-wideload interview"/&gt; Wideload produced two games, 2005's ''[[Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse]]'' and 2008's ''[[Hail to the Chimp]]''.

On September 8, 2009 [[Disney]] acquired Wideload. Seropian joined Disney to head its in-house game development team,&lt;ref name="gamesindustry.biz-wideload acquisition"&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin, Matt|date=2009-09-08|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/disney-adds-bungie-co-founder-wideload-to-games-team|title=Disney adds Bungie co-founder, Wideload to games team|publisher=[[Gamesindustry.biz]]|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Disney Interactive Studios]]. The sale of Wideload was not originally planned: Wideload and Disney began working on a title together, and as conversations turned to a "broader scope and vision", the two companies "discovered [they] had a lot in common," Seropian said.&lt;ref name="gamasutra-why seropian sold"&gt;{{cite web|author=Graft, Kris|date=2009-09-09|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=25049|title=Interview: Why Alex Seropian Sold To Disney|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2009-10-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091112113653/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=25049| archivedate= 12 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seropian left Disney in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Pligge, Zachary.

Retrieved on 2013-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Seropian also serves as [[DePaul University]]'s second "game designer in residence"; DePaul is the first liberal arts university to offer a bachelor's degree for game design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Roberts, Scott |date=2009-04-25 |url=http://gamedev.depaul.edu/?p=69 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412032631/http://gamedev.depaul.edu/?p=69 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-04-12 |title=DePaul welcomes Alex Seropian, Ed Keenan and Bill Muehl to our faculty |publisher=[[DePaul University]] |accessdate=2009-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Toys===
In 2012, Seropian founded a studio named [[Industrial Toys]]. The company plans to develop mobile games for core gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/02/23/halo-co-creator-alex-seropian-founds-industrial-toys-focused-on/|title=Halo co-creator Alex Seropian founds Industrial Toys, focused on mobile|publisher=Joystiq|first=Mike|last=Schramm|date=2012-02-23|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first title by Industrial Toys, ''[[Midnight Star (video game)|Midnight Star]]'', was announced to be a sci-fi shooter designed with touch-based mobile platforms in mind&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngaudiosi/2012/12/11/halo-creator-alex-seropian-explains-how-hes-changing-mobile-games-with-shooter-morning-star/|title=Halo Creator Alex Seropian Explains How He's Changing Mobile Games With Shooter Morning Star|publisher=[[Forbes]]|first=John|last=Gaudiosi|date=2012-12-11|accessdate=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
His son, [[Gabriel Stati]] (born September 30, 1976), served as the vicepresident of [[Ascom Group]] (1999–2007). On April 9, the [[General Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Moldova|Moldovan Prosecutor General's Office]] asked [[Ukraine]] to extradite Gabriel Stati, a Moldovan businessman whom the Moldovan government accused of being involved in the organization and financing of the [[2009 Moldova civil unrest|civil unrest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/world/39280 "Moldova asks Ukraine to extradite businessman Stati"], ''Kyiv Post'', April 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Stati was in Ukrainian custody along with another suspect, [[Aurel Marinescu]], for their alleged "involvement in organizing an attempt to overthrow the Moldovan government." Aurel Marinescu (born 1970), was the chief bodyguard of Stati's company “Stati Holding”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azi.md/ro/print-story/3795 Chirtoaca quizzed by prosecutors for 3 hours]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 16, the [[General Prosecutor of Ukraine|General Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine]] approved the extradition of Stati and Marinescu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/index.php?id=148&amp;listid=89231 "PO extraditing Moldovans involved in Chişinău mass unrest"], Ukrainian Radio.

==Controversy==
{{Undue weight section|date=August 2018}} 
The credibility of the [[Interbrand]] and BrandZ league tables have been cast into doubt by an article written in [[Marketing Week]] by Mark Ritson.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/sectors/industry/brand-valuations-do-not-always-tell-the-full-story/3030524.article&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of clear definitions and valuation dates in the both companies methodology raise questions about the subjectivity involved in brand valuations. Being part of multinational advertising groups, Interbrand and Kantar Millward Brown also suffer from the risk of objectivity. [[Transparency (behavior)|Transparency]] and objectivity are two of the requirements of the [[ISO 10668]] standard of monetary brand valuations.

}}The '''Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy''' ('''CIPFA''') is a professional institute for [[accountant]]s working in the [[public services]], national audit agencies, in major accountancy firms, and in other bodies where [[public money]] needs to be managed. It has 14,000 members. It is the only UK professional accountancy body to specialise in public services. Its qualifications include a [[professional qualification]] for [[public sector]] accountants as well as a postgraduate diploma for people already working in management.

CIPFA is a member of the [[Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies]], the umbrella organisation for the British accountancy profession. It also belongs to the [[International Federation of Accountants]].

CIPFA’s regional branches cover the [[Channel Islands]], [[Europe]], [[English Midlands|Midlands]], [[North East England|North East]], [[North West England|North West]] &amp; [[North Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[South East England|South East]], [[South West England|South West]] &amp; [[South Wales]] and [[Yorkshire]] &amp; the [[Humber]].

==Designation==
Members of CIPFA are entitled to style themselves "Chartered Public Finance Accountant" and use the designatory letters "CPFA".&lt;ref name=charter&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cipfa.org/~/media/files/aboutus/governance/agm/cbls%20211116.pdf?la=en | title = supplemental charter and bye-laws   | date = 2016-11-21 | publisher = Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy | access-date = 2018-06-07 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170709133837/http://www.cipfa.org/~/media/files/aboutus/governance/agm/cbls%20211116.pdf?la=en | archive-date = 2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members who have been elected as Fellow Members can call themselves "Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy" and use the abbreviation "FCPFA".&lt;ref name=charter /&gt;

==History==
CIPFA began life as the Corporate Treasurers' and Accountants' Institute in 1885, which was later renamed the Institute of Municipal Treasurers and Accountants (IMTA) in 1901. This later became the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) in 1973 when it obtained its [[Royal charter|Royal Charter]].

==Qualifications==
CIPFA offers a range of qualifications; the "Professional Qualification" is intended for those working in and with public services in the UK. For people outside of the UK there are some International Public Financial Management qualifications; a "Certificate in Charity Finance &amp; Accountancy"; and a "CIPFA Certificate Investigative Practice Qualification" aimed primarily at investigators who have some experience but who lack any formal qualification.

==Membership==
CIPFA students who have successfully completed the CIPFA Professional Accountancy Qualification and their Practical Experience Portfolio (PEP) are invited to apply for CIPFA Membership. Once membership is approved members can use the designatory letters ‘CPFA’ (Chartered Public Finance Accountant) for as long as they continue membership.

Further routes to membership are available, for example for those with some accountancy qualifications but who must top-up with CIPFA qualifications.  There are also arrangements in place with various other professional accountancy organisations where membership, by examination, of these bodies and an appropriate number of years experience in public finance will be regarded as suitable to progress to membership of CIPFA.

==Mutual recognition==
CIPFA and the [[Society of Management Accountants of Canada]] signed a [[mutual recognition agreement]] in February 2004.

===CMA/CIPFA dual qualification and designations===

CIPFA and CMA Canada have a dual qualification which provides Canadian public sector employees with comprehensive financial management and [[leadership]] training.

On completing the programme, candidates can apply for dual public finance management and accounting designations as a Chartered Public Finance Accountant (CPFA) and [[Certified Management Accountant]] (CMA) from CIPFA and CMA Canada respectively.

CIPFA and [[CPA Australia]] signed a mutual recognition agreement in June 2007.

Although not strictly a form of mutual recognition, CIPFA members of 5 years standing may apply for direct entry to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in [[England]] and [[Wales]] subject to meeting certain criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icaew.com/en/join-us/members-of-other-bodies/pathways-to-membership This scheme is now closed for new applicants and is only available for re-submissions in 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==CIPFA Group==
The CIPFA Group includes, in addition to the main accounting body; Public Finance - a monthly magazine for the public sector; the in-house CIPFA Education and Training Centre with almost 3,000 students at locations across the UK, and works with other places of learning to provide courses locally; and a commercial services arm which provided advice and services for the public sector. They include information and guidance, courses and conferences, [[Property management|property]] and [[asset management]] solutions, consultancy and interim people for a range of public sector clients.

[[Chromatography|Chromatographic techniques]] have been used in blood processing and purification since the 1980s. It has emerged as an effective method of purifying blood components for therapeutic use.

== Human blood plasma ==
[[Blood plasma]] is the liquid component of blood, which contains dissolved proteins, nutrients, ions, and other soluble components. In whole blood, [[red blood cell]]s, [[white blood cell]]s, and [[platelet]]s are suspended within the plasma. The goal of [[Blood plasma fractionation|plasma purification and processing]] is to extract specific materials that are present in blood, and use them for restoration and repair.  There are several components that make up blood plasma, one of which is the protein [[human serum albumin|albumin]]. Albumin is a highly water-soluble protein with considerable structural stability. It serves as a transportation device for materials such as hormones, enzymes, fatty acids, metal ions, and medicinal products.  It is also used for therapeutic purposes, being essential in restoration and maintenance of circulating blood volume in imperative situations such as severe trauma or surgery.  With little room for error, extremely pure samples that are lacking impurities needs to be at hand in good amount. Human blood plasma is important for the body so the nutrients etc. can be stored.

== Development of chromatography ==
Traditionally, the [[Cohn process]] incorporating cold ethanol fratiocination has been used for albumin purification.  However, [[chromatography|chromatographic methods]] for separation started being adopted in the early 1980s.  Developments were ongoing in the time period between when Cohn fractionation started being used, in 1946, and when chromatography started being used, in 1983.  In 1962, the Kistler &amp; Nistchmann process was created which was a spinoff of the Cohn process. Chromatographic processes began to take shape in 1983. In the 1990s, the Zenalb and the CSL Albumex processes were created which incorporated chromatography with a few variations.

The general approach to using chromatography for plasma fractionation for albumin is: recovery of supernatant I, delipidation, [[anion exchange chromatography]], cation exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography.

The recovered purified material is formulated with combinations of sodium octanoate and sodium N-acetyl tryptophanate and then subjected to viral inactivation procedures, including pasteurisation at 60&amp;nbsp;°C.

This is a more efficient alternative than the Cohn process for four main reasons:  1) smooth automation and a relatively inexpensive plant was needed, 2) easier to sterilize equipment and maintain a good manufacturing environment, 3) chromatographic processes are less damaging to the albumin protein, and 4) a more successful albumin end result can be achieved.

Compared with the Cohn process, the albumin purity went up from about 95% to 98% using chromatography, and the yield increased from about 65% to 85%.  Small percentage increases make a difference in regard to  sensitive measurements like purity. There is one big drawback in using chromatography, which has to do with the economics of the process. Although the method was efficient from the processing aspect, acquiring the necessary equipment is a big task.  Large machinery is necessary, and for a long time the lack of equipment availability was not conducive to its widespread use.  The components are more readily available now but it is still a work in progress and will possibly be ready in the future to help the world.

== Bridging Methods ==
Integrating traditional and modern methods is a useful way to process albumin.

There are three main steps that combine Cohn fractionation with chromatography: 1) factors I, II, and III are removed via cold ethanol fractionation, 2) [[Sepharose]] fast flow ion exchange and sepharose fast flow chromatography procedures are run, and 3) gel filtration is run. The result is albumin with 9% lower aluminum levels with a processing time that is almost twice as fast. 
	
Although it was hard to make chromatographic processing methods widely adopted, global expansion is a work in progress.  Various blood components must be readily available at various medical treatment centers around the world.  The Institute of Transfusion Medicine in [[Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] is a plasma fractionation center in the Balkans. Their modernized albumin purification process consists of five steps:
# Starting material is plasma that has been pretreated by [[centrifugation]], 
# A round of gel filtration is run, 
# [[Ion exchange chromatography|ion exchange]] on [[DEAE]] Sepharose is run to bind the albumin to the column, 
# Albumin is eluted with a sodium acetate [[Buffer solution|buffer]], and
# Final polishing with gel filtration.

The end result is a highly pure and safe batch of albumin that is 100% non-[[Pyrogen (fever)|pyrogen]]ic, sterile, and free of active [[HIV virus]]. The product purity is greater than 98% and the protein content is about 50 g/L.

== Non-chromatographic processing methods ==
Other plasma processing methods exist, but generally do not provide the resolution or purity of chromatographic methods. 
[[Two-phase liquid extraction]] may be performed using [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG)-phosphate [[Aqueous two phase system|Aqueous two-phase systems]], with a PEG-rich top layer and a phosphate-rich bottom layer. Although this method is somewhat useful for protein recovery, it does not work as well for the recovery of other blood components. 
Membrane fractionation has the advantage of minimal protein loss yet high removal of pathological plasma components.  This method incorporates processes such as thermofiltration and applying pulsate flow. The latest two-stage membrane system utilizes a high flow recirculation circuit that is effective for removal of [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] cholesterol.  It may prove useful for patients that have clogged arteries and other cardiovascular problems involving cholesterol. 
Batch adsorption, e.g. onto ion exchange media, is only useful when dealing with smaller samples of plasma, typically 200 mL or less. Batch adsorption recovers the product in a larger volume of elution buffer than does column chromatography or frontal chromatography, and the resulting more dilute product requires concentration, typically on a membrane system, which can lead to loss of product by irreversible adsorption to the membrane.

{{more citations needed|date=September 2012}}'''Complexity theory and organizations''', also called '''complexity strategy''' or '''complex adaptive organizations''', is the use of the study of [[Complex systems|complexity systems]] in the field of [[strategic management]] and [[organizational studies]].

Complexity theory is an interdisciplinary theory that grew out of [[systems theory]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Grobman, Gary M 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grobman, Gary M.|title=Complexity Theory: a new way to look at organizational change|journal=Public Administration Quarterly|year=2005|url=http://www.complexityforum.com/members/Grobman%202005%20Complexity%20theory.pdf|volume=29|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|350}} It draws from research in the natural sciences that examines uncertainty and non-linearity.&lt;ref name="Grobman, Gary M 2005"/&gt; Complexity theory emphasizes interactions and the accompanying [[feedback]] loops that constantly change systems. While it proposes that systems are unpredictable, they are also constrained by order-generating rules.&lt;ref name="Burnes, Bernard 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Burnes, Bernard|title=Complexity theories and organizational change|journal=International Journal of Management Reviews|volume=7|issue=2|year=2005|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2370.2005.00107.x|pages=73–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74}}

Complexity theory has been used in the fields of [[strategic management]] and [[organizational studies]].  Application areas include understanding how [[organizations]] or firms [[:wikt:adapt|adapt]] to their environments and how they cope with conditions of uncertainty.  Organisations have complex structures in that they are [[dynamic network analysis|dynamic network]]s of interactions, and their relationships are not aggregations of the individual static entities. They are adaptive; in that the individual and [[collective behavior]] mutate and [[self-organizing|self-organize]] corresponding to a change-initiating micro-event or collection of events.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-02" /&gt;

== Key concepts ==

=== Complex adaptive systems ===
Organizations can be treated as [[complex adaptive systems]] (CAS) as they exhibit fundamental CAS principles like self-organization, [[complexity]], [[emergence]],&lt;ref name="CAS-T-13" /&gt; interdependence, space of possibilities, co-evolution, [[Chaos theory|chaos]], and [[self-similarity]].&lt;ref name="CAS-T-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="terra"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Terra|first1=Leonardo Augusto Amaral|last2=Passador|first2=João Luiz|title=Symbiotic Dynamic: The Strategic Problem from the Perspective of Complexity|journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science|date=2016|volume=33|issue=2|page=235|doi=10.1002/sres.2379|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sres.2379/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAS are contrasted with ordered and [[chaotic systems]] by the relationship that exists between the system and the agents which act within it.  In an ordered system the level of constraint means that all agent behaviour is limited to the rules of the system. In a chaotic system the agents are unconstrained and susceptible to statistical and other analysis.  In a CAS, the system and the agents co-evolve; the system lightly constrains agent behaviour, but the agents modify the system by their interaction with it. This [[self-organizing]] nature is an important characteristic of CAS; and its ability to learn to adapt, differentiate it from other self organizing systems.&lt;ref name=CAS-T-01/&gt;

== Implications for organizational management ==
CAS approaches to strategy seek to understand the nature of system constraints and agent interaction and generally takes an evolutionary or naturalistic approach to strategy.  Some research integrates [[computer simulation and organizational studies]].

===Complexity theory and knowledge management===
Complexity theory also relates to [[knowledge management]] (KM) and [[organizational learning]] (OL). "Complex systems are, by any other definition, learning organizations."&lt;ref name="CAS-T-28" /&gt; Complexity Theory, KM, and OL are all complimentary and co-dependent.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-28" /&gt; “KM and OL each lack a theory of how cognition happens in human social systems – complexity theory offers this missing piece”.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-28" /&gt;

=== Complexity theory and project management ===
Complexity theory is also being used to better understand new ways of doing [[project management]], as traditional models have been found lacking to current challenges.&lt;ref name="Saynisch 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Saynisch, Manfred|title=Beyond frontiers of traditional project management: An approach to evolutionary, self-organizational principles and the complexity theory—results of the research program|journal=Project Management Journal|volume=41|issue=2|year=2010|pages=21–37|doi=10.1002/pmj.20159}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} This approaches advocates forming a "culture of trust" that "welcomes outsiders, embraces new ideas, and promotes cooperation."&lt;ref name="Saynisch 2010"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

=== Recommendations for managers ===
Complexity Theory implies approaches that focus on flatter, more flexible organizations, rather than top-down, command-and-control styles of management.&lt;ref name="Burnes, Bernard 2005"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

==Additional examples ==
A typical example for an organization behaving as CAS, is Wikipedia&lt;ref name="CAS-T-11" /&gt; – collaborated and managed by a loosely organized management structure,&lt;ref name="CAS-T-11" /&gt; composed of a complex mix of [[human–computer interaction]]s.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAS-T-18" /&gt; By managing behavior, and not only mere content, Wikipedia uses simple rules to produce a complex, evolving knowledge base which has largely replaced older sources in popular use.

Other examples include the complex [[Macroeconomics|global macroeconomic network]] within a country or group of countries&lt;!--much more complex than mere macroeconomic, any help in redirecting to a better page would be welcomed---&gt;; [[stock market]] and complex web of [[Cross-border_cooperation|cross-border]] [[holding companies]]; [[manufacturing|manufacturing business]]es&lt;!--much more complex than mere manufacturing, any help in rewording would be welcomed---&gt;; and any human social group-based endeavour in a particular [[ideology]] and [[social system]] such as [[political party|political parties]], [[community|communities]], [[geopolitical]] [[organisations]], and [[terrorist network analysis|terrorist networks]] of both hierarchical and [[leaderless resistance|leaderless]] nature.&lt;ref name="GT-33" /&gt;  This new macro level state may create difficulty for an observer in explaining and describing the collective behaviour in terms of its constituent parts; as a result of the complex dynamic networks of interactions, outlined earlier.&lt;ref name="CAS-T-01" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26887">The '''Demoulas family''' is a [[Greek-Americans|Greek-American]] family that controls DeMoulas Super Markets, Inc., the company that operates the [[DeMoulas Market Basket|Market Basket]] chain of supermarkets. Beginning in 1990, two sides of the Demoulas family fought for control of DeMoulas Super Markets. The dispute ended in 2014, when the family of George Demoulas sold their shares to Arthur T. Demoulas after [[Market Basket protests|protests by employees and customers]].

==Athanasios and Efrosine Demoulas==
Athanasios "Arthur" Demoulas was born in 1883. He was orphaned during the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1897]].&lt;ref name=giant /&gt; On March 17, 1906, he arrived at [[Ellis Island]]. He settled in the Acre neighborhood of [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. In 1914 he married Efrosene Soulis (born 1892), a girl he knew from his native village of [[Kalabaka]]. In 1917 they left their factory jobs and opened DeMoulas Market. By 1921, they had enough money to purchase a home in [[Dracut, Massachusetts]] with a slaughterhouse out back. They hoped their store would become known for its fresh lamb.&lt;ref name="Demoulas v. Demoulas"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zernike|first=Kate|title=Demoulas v. Demoulas|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=11 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], Demoulas would give families who were struggling financially a free piece of bread with ham or allow them to purchase groceries on credit.&lt;ref name=giant /&gt;

The Demoulases had six children; John (1915–2000), George (1919–1971), an unnamed baby girl (1919–1919), Telemachus "Mike" (1920–2003), Ann (1922–), and Evangelos (1925–1930).&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt; In 1954, Athanasios and Efrosine Demoulas sold the market to Mike and George for $15,000.&lt;ref name="Demoulas v. Demoulas" /&gt;

Arthur Demoulas died in 1958. Efrosene died in 1964.&lt;ref name=family&gt;{{cite news|last=Pereira|first=Joseph|title=Family That Amassed Supermarket Fortune Splits in a Bitter Feud|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Demoulas===
John Demoulas was born on March 22, 1915. During his youth, he worked in his family's market. As an adult he ran a chain of liquor stores, a bar in Lowell (the Golden Nugget), and Marion's Cafe, also in Lowell.&lt;ref name=John1&gt;{{cite news|last=Macero|first=Cosmo|title=A DeMoulas steps forward, and maybe up|newspaper=Boston Herald|date=24 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=John2&gt;{{cite book|last=DeMoulas|first=George A.|title=Illegit: A Memoir of Family Intrigue, Wealth, and Cruel Indifference|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Demoulas died on March 8, 2000. Demoulas had four children (John, Arthur, Pamela, and Kathleen) with his wife Marion and five illegitimate children with his mistress Dorothy Bedard (Melveen, Mike, Dorothy, George, and Patricia). In 1999, one of his illegitimate sons had his name legally changed from George Bedard to George DeMoulas.&lt;ref name=John1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=John2 /&gt;

==George Demoulas==
George A. Demoulas was born in 1919 in [[Dracut, Massachusetts]]. He graduated from the [[Hellenic American Academy]] and [[Dracut High School]]. He served in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]] and was stationed at [[Guadalcanal]]. After the war, Demoulas joined the family business. In 1953, he married Evanthea Koukias. After he and his brother Mike purchased their parents' market, Demoulas served as executive vice president and treasurer of DeMoulas Super Markets, Inc. Demoulas, who was described as affable and gregarious, dealt with outside parties, including vendors.&lt;ref name="Demoulas v. Demoulas" /&gt;&lt;ref name=family /&gt; He brought in many friends from the Greek community, including many people from the Acre, to do accounting, banking, and buying for the company.&lt;ref name="Demoulas v. Demoulas" /&gt; Within 15 years, the two brothers had transformed their parents' "mom and pop"-style store into a modern supermarket chain consisting of 15 stores.&lt;ref name="Demoulas v. Demoulas" /&gt;&lt;ref name=GeorgeObituary&gt;{{cite news|title=George A. Demoulas, 51, supermarket exeuctive|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=28 June 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demoulas was a member of the [[Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church (Lowell, Massachusetts)|Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church]] served as its president. He received the title of [[Archon Depoutatos]] from [[Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople]], the highest honor that can be bestowed upon a layman by the Ecumenical Patriarchate.&lt;ref name=GeorgeObituary /&gt;

Outside of DeMoulas Super Markets, Demoulas was a trustee of the [[Lowell Technological Institute]], [[Hellenic College Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology]], and St. John's Hospital in Lowell.&lt;ref name=GeorgeObituary /&gt;

Demoulas died of a heart attack on June 27, 1971, while vacationing with his family in [[Athens, Greece]].&lt;ref name=GeorgeObituary /&gt;

===Children===
George and Evanthea Demoulas had five children; Fotene (1954–), Angelo "Evan" (1955–1993), Diana (1956–), and Arthur S.

Demoulas attended meat cutting school and was given a job in DeMoulas' meat department. He was also appointed to the company's Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="Demoulas v. Demoulas" /&gt; He eventually left the supermarket business to become a racecar driver.&lt;ref name="Demoulas v. Demoulas" /&gt; In 1988 he raced for [[Pacific Racing]] in [[British Formula 3 Championship|British Formula 3]].&lt;ref name=DriverDB /&gt;

On June 13, 1993, Demoulas was in Quebec to watch the [[1993 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]]. After the race, he and his friend and former Pacific teammate [[JJ Lehto]] were driving from the [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve|Circuit Île Notre-Dame]] to downtown [[Montreal]] when Demoulas' car was hit by a driver who had run a red light. Lehto survived, but Demoulas died at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why JJ Lehto is no stranger to tragedy|newspaper=Autosport.com|date=25 January 2011|url=http://plus.autosport.com/premium/feature/3286/why-jj-lehto-is-no-stranger-to-tragedy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was survived by his wife, Rafaele Evans Demoulas, who was pregnant with their daughter at the time.&lt;ref name=EvanObituary /&gt;

====Arthur S. Demoulas====
Arthur Stephen Demoulas was born in 1958. During his youth, he worked for the family business. He attended the [[University of Maine]], where he was a defenseman for the [[Maine Black Bears men's ice hockey|Maine Black Bears hockey]] team.&lt;ref name="Arthur S." /&gt; He later transferred to [[Babson College]], where he graduated in 1984. He continued to work for DeMoulas Super Markets while in college and eventually rose to the position of assistant produce director. He left the company in 1990, as litigation between him and company president Mike Demoulas led a judge to rule that it would be best for Arthur S. to be put on paid leave. Following his family's legal victory over Mike Demoulas, Arthur S. was given a seat on the Board of Directors, but never returned to the chain's daily operations.&lt;ref name="Arthur S."&gt;{{cite news|last=Leung|first=Shirley|title=Out of the public eye, generosity and resolve|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Market Basket, Demoulas is a member of the board of the Boston Police Foundation.&lt;ref name="Arthur S." /&gt;

==Telemachus "Mike" Demoulas==
Telemachus "Mike" Demoulas was born in 1920. During his youth he was the child most involved with his parent's business. In 1938, Demoulas either dropped out or was expelled from high school and went to work for DeMoulas Market full-time. In 1954, he and his brother George purchased the business from their parents.&lt;ref name="Demoulas v. Demoulas" /&gt; Demoulas ran the day-to-day operations of the business and found locations for new stores.&lt;ref name=family /&gt; Within 15 years, the two brothers had transformed their parents' "mom and pop"-style store into a modern supermarket chain consisting of 15 stores.&lt;ref name="Demoulas v. Demoulas" /&gt; After his brother George's death in 1971 he expanded the Demoulas chain. He also began opening stores under different names, including Market Basket. By 1998, there were 57 Demoulas and Market Basket stores.&lt;ref name="Demoulas v. Demoulas" /&gt; He remained President of DeMoulas Super Markets, Inc. until 1999, when he resigned as result of a court order.&lt;ref name=resignation&gt;{{cite news|title= Demoulas president resigns as court order takes effect|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=7 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Market Basket, Demoulas was known for his philanthropy. He gave millions of dollars to many causes, including programs for the blind and college scholarships. He was credited with helping revitalize the Acre by building a new supermarket in providing money for new infrastructure.&lt;ref name=giant&gt;{{cite news|last=Ranalli|first=Ralph|title=Telemachus Demoulas, Supermarket Giant|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=26 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
In 1948, Demoulas married Irene Psoinos. Mike and Irene Demoulas had four children; Frances (1950–), Glorianne (1952–), Arthur T. (1955–), and Caren (1959–).&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt; Glorianne is the mother of [[National Hockey League]] forward [[Bobby Farnham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Nate|title=The Ivy Leaguer who fought his way to the NHL|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/01/bobby-farnham-pittsburgh-penguins-longform|accessdate=January 9, 2016|work=USA Today|date=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arthur T. Demoulas====
Arthur Telemachus Demoulas was born in 1955.&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt; He spent his youth working in the family business. He lived in Lowell until his adolescence, when his family moved to [[Andover, Massachusetts]]. He attended [[Andover High School (Massachusetts)|Andover High School]] (where he played running back on the school's football team) and [[Bentley University|Bentley College]]. In 1974, one year after he graduated from high school, he joined DeMoulas Super Markets Board of Directors. He eventually worked his way up to the position of Vice President. In 1989, after the DeMoulas Super Markets Board of Directors rejected his proposal to start a pharmacy division, Demoulas founded Lee Drug. In 1990, he sold the chain of nine stores to [[Walgreens]].&lt;ref name=touch /&gt; In 1999 he resigned as Vice President as result of a court order, but remained on the Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="resignation"/&gt;

By 2002, Rafaele Evans, the widow of Evan Demoulas, was voting with Arthur T. Demoulas due to her displeasure with her brother-in-law, Arthur S. Demoulas, after he attempted to gain control of the trust that controlled her daughter's shares. This gave Demoulas a majority vote on the Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bailey|first=Steve|title=Demoulas Redux|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=23 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Demoulas was named President and CEO of DeMoulas Super Markets, Inc. During his tenure as CEO, sales grew from $3 billion a year to $4 billion, the number of employees grew from 14,000 to 25,000. During the same time, competitors [[Stop &amp; Shop]] and [[Shaw's]] closed many of their stores due to financial troubles. Market Basket also faced new competition from discount-grocer [[Wegmans]]&lt;ref name=woman&gt;{{cite news|last=Welker|first=Grant|title=How one woman set off the latest chapter in the Market Basket tale|newspaper=Lowell Sun|date=27 August 2014|url=http://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/news/ci_26225290/how-one-woman-set-off-latest-chapter-market#ixzz3BShqnYHn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur T. was known for his ability to remember his employees names, birthdays, and milestones, attending many of their weddings and funerals, checking in on ill workers, and asking about the spouses and children of his employees.&lt;ref name=touch /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28580359 |title= Market Basket: Workers risk it all for their boss |newspaper=BBC News |last=Gittleson | first=Kim |date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was seen as a father figure by a number of his employees and compared to ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' protagonist [[George Bailey (It's a Wonderful Life)|George Bailey]] for his willingness to put people over profit.&lt;ref name="most beloved"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/money/3024511/market-basket-ceo-demoulas-protest/ |title=Meet America’s Most Beloved CEO—Too Bad He Just Got Fired |newspaper=TIME |date=23 July 2014 |author=Tuttle, Brad |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Demoulas' opponents criticized him for being "openly defiant" of the board of directors and having a "dictatorial" management style.&lt;ref name=woman /&gt; He was fired by the Board of Directors in June 2014, but returned to the company in August after months of protests by Market Basket employees and customers led the family of George Demoulas to sell their shares to Arthur T.&lt;ref name=deal /&gt;

Demoulas resides in Lowell. He and his wife Maureen have three daughters; Madeline, Irene, Mary and;  one son  Telemachus Arthur  &lt;ref name=touch /&gt;

==Legal disputes==
In October 1989, Evan Demoulas was notified that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was seeking back taxes on $1 million worth of stock he had sold three years earlier. Demoulas was confused by the call, as he had never sold any stock. He investigated and found that his uncle, Mike Demoulas, had purchased much of his and his family's shares in Demoulas Super Markets without their knowledge.&lt;ref name=family /&gt;

In 1990, the widow and children of George Demoulas sued Mike Demoulas, alleging that they had been defrauded out of their shares in the company. They claimed they had trusted Mike to take care of the family after George's death and that he exploited this trust in order to have them sell all of George's real estate and 84% of his shares in DeMoulas Super Markets to members of his own family pennies on the dollar.&lt;ref name="Demoulas v. Demoulas" /&gt; Mike Demoulas contended that his brother's heirs had willingly sold their shares in the company because they wanted money and their stock in DeMoulas did not pay dividends. According to Mike Demoulas, Evanthea, asked him to sell her shares so she could have money to raise her children, Evan sold his shares so he could begin his auto racing career, and Diana and Fotene sold their shares after the saw how much money their brother received. However, once the company began paying dividends in 1988, the family saw how much money they could have made if they had kept their shares and sought to "rewrite history" in order to regain what they had sold. George's children acknowledged that they had signed many of the documents authorizing the sales and transfers, but stated they were not aware of what they were signing because they were too young to understand and trusted their uncle to take care of them. A jury found in favor of George's family.&lt;ref name="Demoulas v. Demoulas" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zealousness&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frisch|first=Michael S.|title=Zealousness Run Amok|journal=The Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics|date=Fall 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks after the decision, George's son Arthur S. Demoulas filed a second suit, this time alleging that Mike Demoulas had diverted assets from the jointly-owned family company, Demoulas Super Markets, to ones controlled by him and his children, including Market Basket. After an eighty-four-day bench trial, judge [[Maria Lopez]] found in favor of the plaintiffs. Lopez awarded George's family about $206 million for dividends on stock that had been improperly diverted and 50.5% of the company. She also ordered that all of the assets of Market Basket and the other companies controlled by Mike Demoulas and his family be transferred to Demoulas Super Markets and that Mike Demoulas be removed as president of the company.&lt;ref name=Zealousness /&gt;&lt;ref name=wiretap&gt;{{cite news|last=Nealon|first=Patricia|title=Wiretap claims are key to DeMoulas fight|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=16 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September 1990, six [[Covert listening device|bugs]] were found at the headquarters of DeMoulas Super Markets. It was alleged that Arthur S. Demoulas had planted the bugs in order to listen to the legal strategy of the other side of the Demoulas family. Michael Kettenbach, the son-in law of Mike Demoulas, sued Arthur S. Demoulas, claiming that Demoulas had "invaded his privacy rights by having listening devices planted at DSM headquarters." In 1994, a jury found in favor of Arthur S. Demoulas.&lt;ref name=Zealousness /&gt;&lt;ref name=wiretap /&gt; However, a new trial was granted after a woman came forward with new evidence – a recording of her boyfriend admitting to bugging the office for Arthur S. Demoulas. The case was damaged though when the woman admitted to being a crack cocaine addict who received about $500,000 in housing and other expenses from the family of Telemachus Demoulas and the man on the tape testified that he had been lying during the recorded conversation. On August 4, 1997, Arthur S. Demoulas was again cleared of wiretapping charges by a federal jury.&lt;ref name=Zealousness /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zealousness /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nealon|first=Patricia|title=Federal court jury clears Demoulas|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=5 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, George Demoulas' family sued Mike Demoulas, Arthur T. Demoulas, and DeMoulas Super Markets, Inc. chief financial officer D. Harold Sullivan, alleging that the three violated the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]] by using their positions as the trustees of the company's employee profit-sharing plan to make fiscally irresponsible real estate loans to friends and business associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=John H.|title=Demoulas family in another legal squabble|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=16 October 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Labor]] filed a similar complaint six months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zuckoff|first=Mitchell|title=Labor Dept. Joins Demoulas Family Fight|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=13 June 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 1994 the Department of Labor announced that they had reached a settlement in which the trustees agreed to sell $22 million of the loans by July 11 or purchase them themselves as well as pay the plan $750,000 to make up for the dropped interest rates on the loans (unless the loan recipients paid the money instead). The trustees also agreed not to make any similar investments. The trustees admitted no wrongdoing in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=John H.|title=Demoulas pension plan suit is settled|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=1 June 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the heavy investment in risky real estate loans, the plan never posted a loss. In the civil case, Judge [[Rya W. Zobel]] ruled that the trustees' actions were "wrong but not corrupt" and that the settlement with the Department of Labor was "an adequate remedy". Therefore, she denied the request to have them removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reidy|first=Chris|title=Pension trustees cleared|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=14 April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] upheld a lower court's ruling that Arthur T. Demoulas had presented the DeMoulas Super Markets Board of Directors with “misleading, inaccurate, and materially incomplete” information in order to receive a rejection and keep his cousins from receiving any of the profits from Lee Drug, a pharmacy chain he started after the board rejected his proposal to start a pharmacy division of Market Basket.&lt;ref name=touch&gt;{{cite news|last=Borchers|first=Callum|title=Arthur T.

[[File:Market Basket at the Cape Cod Factory Outlet Mall.JPG|thumb|Market Basket store in Bourne]]
In a 2010 memo to the Board of Directors, Arthur S. Demoulas accused Arthur T. Demoulas of "plundering" millions by paying millions in excessive real estate prices for new Market Basket store locations. One example cited in the memo alleged that Arthur T. had recommended that the company pay $20.9 million to purchase a property in [[Bourne, Massachusetts]] owned by an entity in which he was a major investor. After the sale, Arthur S. had the property appraised by a Boston real estate executive, who valued the property at $9 million. He also accused Arthur T. of paying "grossly excessive fees" to Retail Development and Management Inc., a real estate firmed owned by his brothers-in-law Michael Kettenbach and Joseph Pasquale that oversaw Market Basket's real estate and helped it develop new stores. He and his attorneys argued that the 7.5% of the total development costs "was far in excess" of the prevailing market rate of 2% to 3%.&lt;ref name=memos&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Casey|title= Legal memos trace acrimony between Demoulas factions|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=2 August 2014|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/08/01/legal-memos-trace-acrimony-between-demoulas-factions-over-real-estate-deals/FPXxU0sANyOcyzmpzjISmO/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur T. denied his cousin's claim. He argued that Arthur S. trumped up the charges in order to take control of the company and pay himself and the other shareholders more money. Attorneys for Arthur T. noted that [[Cushman &amp; Wakefield]] later appraised the Bourne property at $25.5 million. Arthur T. also defended his arrangement with Kettenbach and Pasquale, which he said allowed Market Basket to purchase properties without alerting its competitors, thus avoiding a bidding war and saving the company money.&lt;ref name=memos /&gt; The Board of Directors hired Mel L. Greenberg, a retired judge, to investigate Arthur S.' claims. Greenberg found that there was no wrongdoing by Arthur T. in the purchase of real estate (including the Bourne property) that the fees paid to Retail Development and Management were not excessive. However, he did find that Arthur T. and the Board of Directors had neglected their fiduciary duties by not looking into whether or not the company would have been better off if it had exercised its option to purchase its store in [[Somersworth, New Hampshire]] instead of renting it from a company in which Arthur T. and his family owned a 55% stake.&lt;ref name=memos /&gt;

==Firing of Arthur T. Demoulas, protests, and sale of shares==
{{main|Market Basket protests}}

'''Disagree and commit''' is a management principle which states that individuals are allowed to disagree while a decision is being made, but that once a decision has been made, everybody must commit to it. The principle can also be understood as a statement about ''when'' it is useful to have conflict and disagreement, with the principle saying disagreement is useful in early states of [[decision-making]] while harmful after a decision has been made.&lt;ref name="Origbo"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://seekingmastery.wordpress.com/2017/05/29/make-disagree-and-commit-work-for-you/ | title = Make "Disagree and Commit" Work for You | website = Seeking Mastery | publisher = WordPress.com | first = Efesa | last = Origbo | date = May 29, 2017 | accessdate = July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disagree and commit is a method of avoiding the consensus trap, in which the lack of consensus leads to inaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://encyclopedia.uia.org/en/problem/140262 | title = Consensus trap {{!}} World Problems &amp; Global Issues | publisher = ''[[Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential|The Encyclopedia of World Problems]]'' | accessdate = July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Cj9s1QihGPIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else in Business | first = Patrick | last = Lencioni | date = March 14, 2012 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | quote = Great teams avoid the consensus trap by embracing a concept that Intel, the legendary microchip manufacturer, calls "disagree and commit." Basically they believe that even when people can't come to an agreement around an issue, they must still leave the room umambiguously committed to a common course of action.| isbn = 9781118266106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Scott McNealy]] used the phrase as early as sometime between 1983 and 1991, as part of the line "Agree and commit, disagree and commit, or get out of the way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rQl4169IA4kC&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=disagree%20and%20commit%20scott%20mcnealy&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=disagree%20and%20commit%20scott%20mcnealy&amp;f=false | title = High Noon: The Inside Story of Scott McNealy and the Rise of Sun Microsystems | first = Karen | last = Southwick | year = 1999 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.| isbn = 9780471297130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name="Origbo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://ecorner.stanford.edu/1642.ect | title = Agree and Commit, Disagree and Commit | first = Greg | last = Ballard | date = November 15, 2006 | publisher = Stanford eCorner | quote = This is a phrase, agree and commit, disagree and commit, that actually comes from Scott McNealy. At least that's where I was told it was from.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has also been attributed to [[Andrew Grove]] at [[Intel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.inc.com/magazine/201412/patrick-lencioni/innovation-wont-get-you-very-far.html | title = Why Great Leadership Fuels Innovation | date = November 20, 2014 | publisher = Inc.com | first = Patrick | last = Lencioni | accessdate = July 2, 2017 | quote = At Intel, Grove demanded not only that his people argue well, but also that they leave those argument-rich meetings fully committed to the decisions that had been made. His famous axiom "disagree and commit" captures an essential truth: Failure to capitalize on a new idea often has far less to do with the quality of the idea than with the indecision and waffling that accompany it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AdqIP5GN4GQC&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;vq=disagree%20and%20commit&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Absolute Honesty: Building a Corporate Culture that values Straight Talk and Rewards Integrity |first1=Larry |last1=Johnson |first2=Bob |last2=Phillips | year = 2003 | publisher = AMACOM| isbn = 9780814407813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|112}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/monika-szamko/what-the-paranoid-got-rig_b_9612326.html | title = What the Paranoid Got Right – The Unlikely Legacy of Andy Grove's Intel | publisher = [[The Huffington Post]] | first = Monika | last = Szamko | date = April 5, 2016 | accessdate = July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amazon.com|Amazon]] added "Have a Backbone; Disagree and Commit" as one of its leadership principles sometime in 2010–2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/Values-Careers-Homepage/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=239365011 | title = Amazon.com: Amazon Values | deadurl = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110522092317/http://www.amazon.com/Values-Careers-Homepage/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=239365011 | archivedate = 2011-05-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon CEO [[Jeff Bezos]] mentioned the term in his "2016 Letter to Shareholders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/p/feature/z6o9g6sysxur57t | title = About Amazon - 2016 Letter to Shareholders | accessdate = July 2, 2017 | date = April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Employment''' is a relationship between two [[party (law)|parties]], usually based on a [[employment contract|contract]] where work is paid for, where one party, which may be a [[corporation]], [[for profit]], [[not-for-profit organization]], [[co-operative]] or other entity is the [[employer]] and the other is the [[employee]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Employees work in return for [[payment]], which may be in the form of an hourly wage, by [[piecework]] or an annual [[salary]], depending on the type of work an employee does or which sector she or he is working in. Employees in some fields or sectors may receive [[gratuity|gratuities]], [[bonus payment]] or [[stock option]]s. In some types of employment, employees may receive benefits in addition to payment. Benefits can include [[health insurance]], [[housing]], [[disability insurance]] or use of a gym. Employment is typically governed by [[Labour law|employment laws]], regulations or legal contracts.

An '''employee''' contributes labor and expertise to an endeavor of an '''employer''' or of a person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Archer| first1 = Richard| last2 = Borthwick| first2 = Kerry| last3 = Travers| first3 = Michelle| last4 = Ruschena| first4 = Leo| title = WHS: A Management Guide| url = https://books.google.com/?id=cQapBQAAQBAJ| edition = 4| publisher = Cengage Learning Australia| date = 2017| pages = 30–31| isbn = 9780170270793| access-date = 2016-03-30| quote = The most significant definitions are 'person conducting a business or undertaking' (PCBU). 'worker' and 'workplace'. [...] 'PCBU' is a wider ranging term than 'employer', though this will be what most people understand by it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is usually hired to perform specific duties which are packaged into a [[job (role)|job]]. In a corporate context, an employee is a person who is hired to provide services to a [[company]] on a regular basis in exchange for [[Financial compensation|compensation]] and who does not provide these services as part of an [[independent business]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Employer–worker relationship ==
Employer and managerial control within an organization rests at many levels and has important implications for staff and productivity alike, with control forming the fundamental link between desired outcomes and actual processes. Employers must balance interests such as decreasing wage constraints with a maximization of labor productivity in order to achieve a profitable and productive employment relationship.

===Labor Acquisition===
{{further|Application for employment}}
The main ways for [[employer]]s to find workers and for people to find employers are via jobs listings in newspapers (via [[classified advertising]]) and online, also called [[job board]]s. Employers and job seekers also often find each other via professional [[recruitment consultant]]s which receive a [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] from the employer to find, screen and select suitable candidates. However, a study has shown that such consultants may not be reliable when they fail to use established principles in selecting employees.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/paperpdf/Predicting%20job%20performance.pdf|title=Predicting job performance: A comparison of expert opinion and research findings|last1=Dakin|first1=Stephen|last2=Armstrong|first2=J. Scott|journal=International Journal of Forecasting|volume=5|issue=2|pages=187–94|year=1989|doi=10.1016/0169-2070(89)90086-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more traditional approach is with a "Help Wanted" [[sign]] in the establishment (usually hung on a window or door&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJgyAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=help+wanted+sign#v=snippet&amp;q=%22help%20wanted%22%20sign&amp;f=false|title=Report to the Legislature of the State of New York by the Commission appointed under Chapter 518 of the laws of 1909 to inquire into the question of employers' liability and other matters|author=[[J. Mayhew Wainwright]]|pages=11,50,144|year=1910|publisher=J. B. Lyon Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; or placed on a store counter).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=91V6_EEO9XoC&amp;pg=PA74|title=Intro to Business |author=Robert A. Ristau|page=74|year=2010|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=978-0538740661}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evaluating different employees can be quite laborious but setting up different techniques to analyze their skill to measure their talents within the field can be best through assessments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Industrial &amp; Organizational Assessment]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Employer and potential employee commonly take the additional step of getting to know each other through the process of [[job interview]].

===Training and development===
[[Training and development]] refers to the employer's effort to equip a newly hired employee with necessary skills to perform at the job, and to help the employee grow within the organization.  An appropriate level of training and development helps to improve employee's [[job satisfaction]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Remuneration===
There are many ways that employees are paid, including by hourly wages, by [[piecework]], by yearly [[salary]], or by [[gratuity|gratuities]] (with the latter often being combined with another form of payment). In sales jobs and real estate positions, the employee may be paid a [[commission (remuneration)|commission]], a percentage of the value of the goods or services that they have sold. In some fields and professions (e.g., executive jobs), employees may be eligible for a bonus if they meet certain targets. Some executives and employees may be paid in [[stock]]s or [[stock option]]s, a compensation approach that has the added benefit, from the company's point of view, of helping to align the interests of the compensated individual with the performance of the company.

===Employee benefits===
[[Employee benefits]] are various non-wage compensation provided to employee in addition to their wages or salaries.  The benefits can include:  housing (employer-provided or employer-paid), group insurance (health, dental, life etc.), disability income protection, retirement benefits, daycare, tuition reimbursement, sick leave, vacation (paid and non-paid), social security, profit sharing, funding of education, and other specialized benefits. In some cases, such as with workers employed in remote or isolated regions, the benefits may include meals.  Employee benefits can improve the relationship between employee and employer and lowers staff turnover.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Organizational justice ===
[[Organizational justice]] is an employee's perception and judgement of employer's treatment in the context of fairness or justice.  The resulting actions to influence the employee-employer relationship is also a part of organizational justice.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Workforce organizing ===
Employees can organize into trade or [[labor union]]s, which represent the work force to collectively bargain with the management of organizations about working, and contractual conditions and services.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Ending employment ===
Usually, either an employee or employer may end the relationship at any time, often subject to a certain notice period. This is referred to as [[at-will employment]]. The contract between the two parties specifies the responsibilities of each when ending the relationship and may include requirements such as notice periods, [[severance pay]], and security measures.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In some professions, notably teaching, civil servants, university professors, and some orchestra jobs, some employees may have [[tenure]], which means that they cannot be dismissed at will. Another type of termination is a [[layoff]].

==Wage labor==
{{main|Wage labor}}
[[File:Rebar worker.jpg|thumb|Worker assembling [[rebar]] for a water treatment plant in [[Mazatlan]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Mexico]].]]

Wage labor is the [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] relationship between a [[Workforce|worker]] and an employer, where the worker sells their [[Labour economics|labor]] under a formal or informal employment [[contract]]. These transactions usually occur in a [[labor market]] where [[wage]]s are market determined.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|title =The Law of the Labour Market|last1 = Deakin|first1 = Simon|last2= Wilkinson|first2= Frank|publisher =Oxford University Press|date = 2005|url = http://moglen.law.columbia.edu/twiki/pub/EngLegalHist/StatuteLaborers/Davies_et_al.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1847|loc=[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/ch02.htm Chapter&amp;nbsp;2.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for the wages paid, the work product generally becomes the [[work for hire|undifferentiated property]] of the employer, except for special cases such as the vesting of [[intellectual property]] patents in the United States where [[patent#Ownership|patent rights]] are [[freelancer|usually]] vested in the original personal inventor. A wage laborer is a person whose primary means of income is from the selling of his or her labor in this way.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In modern mixed economies such as that of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development#Current members|countries]], it is currently the dominant form of work arrangement. Although most work occurs following this structure, the wage work arrangements of  [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]], professional employees, and professional contract workers are sometimes conflated with [[working class|class assignments]], so that "wage labor" is considered to apply only to unskilled, semi-skilled or [[manual labour|manual labor]].&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133" /&gt;

Wage labor, as institutionalized under today's market economic systems, has been criticized,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellerman|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; especially by both mainstream [[Socialism|socialists]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]],&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ostergaard|1997|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English Working Class p. 599"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=599}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English Working Class p. 912"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=912}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shop Floor p. 37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lazonick|1990|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[pejorative]] term [[wage slavery]].&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |publisher= [[Merriam Webster|merriam-webster.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= wage slave |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave |publisher= [[dictionary.com]] |accessdate= 4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialists draw parallels between the trade of labor as a commodity and [[slavery]]. [[Cicero]] is also known to have suggested such parallels.&lt;ref&gt;"...vulgar are the means of livelihood of all hired workmen whom we pay for mere manual labour, not for artistic skill; for in their case the very wage they receive is a pledge of their slavery." – [[De Officiis]] [http://www.constitution.org/rom/de_officiis.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The American philosopher [[John Dewey]] posited that until "[[economic exploitation|industrial feudalism]]" is replaced by "industrial [[democracy]]", politics will be "the shadow cast on society by big business".&lt;ref&gt;"As long as politics is the shadow cast on society by big business, the attenuation of the shadow will not change the substance", in "The Need for a New Party" (1931), Later Works 6, p163&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Ferguson (academic)|Thomas Ferguson]] has postulated in his [[investment theory of party competition]] that the undemocratic nature of economic institutions under capitalism causes elections to become occasions when blocs of investors coalesce and compete to control the state.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ferguson|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment contract==
{{main|Employment contract}}

===Australia===
Australian employment has been governed by the [[Fair Work Act]] since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/19/2193974.htm |title=House of Reps seals 'death' of WorkChoices  |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2008-03-19 |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies ([[BAIRA]]) is an association of national level with its international reputation of co-operation and welfare of the migrant workforce as well as its approximately 1200 members agencies in collaboration with and support from the Government of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133" /&gt;

===Canada===
In the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]], formal complaints can be brought to the [[Ministry of Labour (Ontario)|Ministry of Labour]]. In the province of [[Quebec]], grievances can be filed with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061011030434/http://www.cnt.gouv.qc.ca/en/index.asp Commission des normes du travail].&lt;ref name="Shop Floor p. 37" /&gt;

===Pakistan===
[[Pakistan]] has no contract Labor, Minimum Wage and Provident Funds Acts. Contract labor in Pakistan must be paid minimum wage and certain facilities are to be provided to labor. However, the Acts are not yet fully implemented.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133" /&gt;

===India===
[[India]] has Contract Labor, Minimum Wage, Provident Funds Act and various other acts to comply with. Contract labor in India must be paid minimum wage and certain facilities are to be provided to labor. However, there is still a large amount of work that remains to be done to fully implement the Act.&lt;ref name="Shop Floor p. 37" /&gt;

===Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]], employment is regulated by the [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Department of Labor and Employment]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, employment contracts are categorised by the government into the following types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contract types and employer responsibilities|url=https://www.gov.uk/contract-types-and-employer-responsibilities|publisher=gov.uk|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fixed-term contract]]: last for a certain length of time, are set in advance, end when a specific task is completed, ends when a specific event takes place.
* [[Full-time]] or [[part-time contract]]: has no defined length of time, can be terminated by either party, is to accomplish a specific task, specified number of hours.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
* Agency staff
* [[Freelancer]]s, [[Consultant]]s and [[Independent contractor|Contractors]]
* [[Zero-hour contract]]s

===United States===
{{see also|United States labor law|List of largest employers in the United States|Labor unions in the United States}}
[[File:EmploymentUSbranchFredgr.png|thumb|All employees, private industries, by branches]]
For purposes of U.S. federal income tax withholding, 26 U.S.C. § 3401(c) provides a definition for the term "employee" specific to chapter 24 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]]:

"For purposes of this chapter, the term “employee” includes an officer, employee, or elected official of the United States, a State, or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing. The term “employee” also includes an officer of a corporation."&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 3401(c)&lt;/ref&gt; This definition does not exclude all those who are commonly known as 'employees'. “Similarly, Latham’s instruction which indicated that under 26 U.S.C. § 3401(c) the category of ‘employee’ does not include privately employed wage earners is a preposterous reading of the statute. It is obvious that within the context of both statutes the word ‘includes’ is a term of enlargement not of limitation, and the reference to certain entities or categories is not intended to exclude all others.”&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Latham'', 754 F.2d 747, 750 (7th Cir. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

Employees are often contrasted with [[independent contractors]], especially when there is dispute as to the worker's entitlement to have matching taxes paid, [[workers compensation]], and [[unemployment insurance]] benefits. However, in September 2009, the court case of ''Brown v. J. Kaz, Inc.'' ruled that independent contractors are regarded as employees for the purpose of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|discrimination laws]] if they work for the employer on a regular basis, and said employer directs the time, place, and manner of employment.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web | title = Brown v. J. Kaz, Inc., No. 08-2713 (3d Cir. Sept. 11, 2009) | url = http://www.employmentlawblog.info/2009/09/brown-v-j-kaz-inc-no-08-2713-3d-cir-sept-11-2009.shtml| accessdate = 2010-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-union work environments, in the United States, unjust termination complaints can be brought to the [[United States Department of Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Termination |url=http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/termination/index.htm|publisher=[[United States Department of Labor]]|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labor unions are legally recognized as representatives of workers in many industries in the United States.  Their activity today centers on [[collective bargaining]] over wages, benefits, and working conditions for their membership, and on representing their members in disputes with management over violations of contract provisions. Larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and electioneering at the state and federal level.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Most unions in America are aligned with one of two larger umbrella organizations: the [[AFL-CIO]] created in 1955, and the [[Change to Win Federation]] which split from the AFL-CIO in 2005. Both advocate policies and legislation on behalf of workers in the United States and Canada, and take an active role in politics. The AFL-CIO is especially concerned with global trade issues.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Sweden===
According to Swedish law,&lt;ref&gt;Lag om anställningsskydd (1982:80)&lt;/ref&gt; there are three types of employment.
* Test employment (''swe: Provanställning''), where the employer hires a person for a test period of 6 months maximum. The employment can be ended at any time without giving any reason. This type of employment can be offered only once per employer and employee combination. Usually a time limited or normal employment is offered after a test employment.&lt;ref name="ODI2" /&gt;
* Time limited employment (''swe: Tidsbegränsad anställning''). The employer hires a person for a specified time. Usually they are extended for a new period. Total maximum two years per employer and employee combination, then it automatically counts as a normal employment.
* Normal employment (''swe: Tillsvidareanställning / Fast anställning''), which has no time limit (except for retirement etc.). It can still be ended for two reasons: '''personal reason''', immediate end of employment only for strong reasons such as crime, or '''lack of work tasks''' (''swe: Arbetsbrist''), cancellation of employment, usually because of bad income for the company. There is a cancellation period of 1–6 months, and rules for how to select employees, basically those with shortest employment time shall be cancelled first.&lt;ref name="ODI2" /&gt;
There are no laws about [[minimum wage|minimum salary]] in Sweden. Instead there are agreements between employer organizations and trade unions about minimum salaries, and other employment conditions.

There is a type of employment contract which is common but not regulated in law, and that is Hour employment (''swe: Timanställning''), which can be Normal employment (unlimited), but the work time is unregulated and decided per immediate need basis. The employee is expected to be answering the phone and come to work when needed, e.g. when someone is ill and absent from work. They will receive salary only for actual work time and can in reality be fired for no reason by not being called anymore. This type of contract is common in the public sector.&lt;ref name="ODI2" /&gt;

==Age-related issues==

=== Younger age workers ===
[[File:US youth employment rate, both genders.png|thumb|Youth employment rate in the [[United States|US]], i.e. the ratio of employed persons (15–24Y) in an economy to total [[Labor force in the United States|labor force]] (15–24Y).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117072912/http://www.bluenomics.com/data#!data/labour_market/employment/employment_rate_15_24y_/employment_rate_15_24y_annual_both_genders_in_%7Cchart/line$countries=usa&amp;sorting=list//title | title=Bluenomics}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{Main|Young worker safety and health}}

Young workers are at higher risk for [[occupational injury]] and face certain [[occupational hazard]]s at a higher rate; this is generally due to their employment in high-risk industries. For example, in the United States, young people are injured at work at twice the rate of their older counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title =  Young Worker Safety and Health  |publisher= CDC NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/youth/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These workers are also at higher risk for [[motor vehicle accidents]] at work, due to less work experience, a lower use of seatbelts, and higher rates of distracted driving.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-152/pdfs/2013-152.pdf|title = Work-Related Motor Vehicle Crashes: Preventing Injury to Young Drivers|date = September 2013|accessdate = |website = NIOSH Publication 2013-152|publisher = NIOSH|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To mitigate this risk, those under the age of 17 are restricted from certain types of driving, including transporting people and goods under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

High-risk industries for young workers include agriculture, restaurants, waste management, and mining.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-153/pdfs/2013-153.pdf|title = Work-Related Motor Vehicle Crashes|last = |first = |date = September 2013|work = NIOSH Publication 2013-153|access-date = |via = |publisher = NIOSH}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, those under the age of 18 are restricted from certain jobs that are deemed dangerous under the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Youth employment programs are most effective when they include both theoretical classroom training and hands-on training with work placements.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Holden, Youth employment programmes – What can be learnt from international experience with youth employment programmes? Economic and private sector professional evidence and applied knowledge services https://partnerplatform.org/?fza26891&lt;/ref&gt;

In the conversation of employment among younger aged workers, youth unemployment has also been monitored. [[Youth unemployment]] rates tend to be higher than the adult rates in every country in the world.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Older age workers ===
Those older than the statutory defined retirement age may continue to work, either out of enjoyment or necessity. However, depending on the nature of the job, older workers may need to transition into less-physical forms of work to avoid injury. Working past retirement age also has positive effects, because it gives a sense of purpose and allows people to maintain social networks and activity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/741559|title = When It Comes to Work, How Old Is Too Old?|date = May 3, 2011|accessdate = |website = NIOSH: Workplace Safety and Health|publisher = Medscape and NIOSH|last = Chosewood|first = L.

==Working poor==
[[File:Worker, Dhaka, Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|Worker, [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]].]]
Employment is no guarantee of escaping [[poverty]], the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) estimates that as many as 40% of workers are poor, not earning enough to keep their families above the $2 a day [[poverty line]].&lt;ref name="ODI2"&gt;Claire Melamed, Renate Hartwig and Ursula Grant 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5752&amp;title=jobs-growth-poverty-employment Jobs, growth and poverty: what do we know, what don't we know, what should we know?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520045610/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5752&amp;title=jobs-growth-poverty-employment |date=May 20, 2011 }} London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[India]] most of the chronically poor are wage earners in formal employment, because their jobs are insecure and low paid and offer no chance to accumulate wealth to avoid risks.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; According to the [[UNRISD]], increasing labor productivity appears to have a negative impact on job creation: in the 1960s, a 1% increase in output per worker was associated with a reduction in employment growth of 0.07%, by the first decade of this century the same productivity increase implies reduced employment growth by 0.54%.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; Both increased employment opportunities and increased labor productivity (as long as it also translates into higher wages) are needed to tackle poverty. Increases in employment without increases in productivity leads to a rise in the number of "working poor", which is why some experts are now promoting the creation of "quality" and not "quantity" in labor market policies.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; This approach does highlight how higher productivity has helped reduce poverty in [[East Asia]], but the negative impact is beginning to show.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; In [[Vietnam]], for example, employment growth has slowed while productivity growth has continued.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; Furthermore, productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as can be seen in the [[United States]], where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] argue that there are differences across [[economic sector]]s in creating employment that reduces poverty.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; 24 instances of growth were examined, in which 18 reduced poverty. This study showed that other sectors were just as important in reducing [[unemployment]], such as [[manufacturing]].&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; The [[services sector]] is most effective at translating productivity growth into employment growth. [[Agriculture]] provides a safety net for jobs and economic buffer when other sectors are struggling.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

==Models of the employment relationship==
Scholars conceptualize the employment relationship in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Bruce E. (2004) ''Theoretical Perspectives on Work and the Employment Relationship'', Industrial Relations Research Association.&lt;/ref&gt; A key assumption is the extent to which the employment relationship necessarily includes conflicts of interests between employers and employees, and the form of such conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Alan (1974) ''Beyond Contract: Work, Power and Trust Relations'', Farber and Farber.&lt;/ref&gt; In economic theorizing, the labor market mediates all such conflicts such that employers and employees who enter into an employment relationship are assumed to find this arrangement in their own self-interest. In human resource management theorizing, employers and employees are assumed to have shared interests (or a unity of interests, hence the label “unitarism”). Any conflicts that exist are seen as a manifestation of poor human resource management policies or interpersonal clashes such as personality conflicts, both of which can and should be managed away. From the perspective of pluralist industrial relations, the employment relationship is characterized by a plurality of stakeholders with legitimate interests (hence the label “pluralism), and some conflicts of interests are seen as inherent in the employment relationship (e.g., wages v. profits). Lastly, the critical paradigm emphasizes antagonistic conflicts of interests between various groups (e.g., the competing capitalist and [[working classes]] in a Marxist framework) that are part of a deeper social conflict of unequal power relations. As a result, there are four common models of employment:&lt;ref&gt;Budd, John W. and Bhave, Devasheesh (2008) "Values, Ideologies, and Frames of Reference in Industrial Relations," in ''Sage Handbook of Industrial Relations'', Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Mainstream economics: employment is seen as a mutually advantageous transaction in a free market between self-interested legal and economic equals
# [[Human resource management]] (unitarism): employment is a long-term partnership of employees and employers with common interests
# [[Industrial relations|Pluralist industrial relations]]: employment is a bargained exchange between stakeholders with some common and some competing economic interests and unequal bargaining power due to imperfect labor markets&lt;ref name="ODI2" /&gt;
# Critical [[industrial relations]]: employment is an unequal power relation between competing groups that is embedded in and inseparable from systemic inequalities throughout the socio-politico-economic system.

These models are important because they help reveal why individuals hold differing perspectives on human resource management policies, labor unions, and employment regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Befort, Stephen F. and Budd, John W. (2009) ''Invisible Hands, Invisible Objectives: Bringing Workplace Law and Public Policy Into Focus'', Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, human resource management policies are seen as dictated by the market in the first view, as essential mechanisms for aligning the interests of employees and employers and thereby creating profitable companies in the second view, as insufficient for looking out for workers’ interests in the third view, and as manipulative managerial tools for shaping the ideology and structure of the workplace in the fourth view.&lt;ref&gt;Budd, John W. and Bhave, Devasheesh (2010) "The Employment Relationship," in ''Sage Handbook of Handbook of Human Resource Management'', Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic literature==
Literature on the employment impact of economic growth and on how growth is associated with employment at a macro, sector and industry level was aggregated in 2013.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform.org"&gt;Yurendra Basnett and Ritwika Sen, What do empirical studies say about economic growth and job creation in developing countries? Economic and private sector professional evidence and applied knowledge services https://partnerplatform.org/?7ljwndv4&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers found evidence to suggest growth in manufacturing and services have good impact on employment. They found GDP growth on employment in agriculture to be limited, but that value-added growth had a relatively larger impact.&lt;ref name="ODI2" /&gt; The impact on job creation by industries/economic activities as well as the extent of the body of evidence and the key studies. For extractives, they again found extensive evidence suggesting growth in the sector has limited impact [[John Cena|on]] employment. In textiles however, although evidence was low, studies suggest growth there positively contributed to job creation. In [[agri-business]] and [[food processing]], they found impact growth to be positive.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform.org"/&gt;

They found that most available literature focuses on [[OECD]] and [[middle-income countries]] somewhat, where economic growth impact has been shown to be positive on employment. The researchers didn't find sufficient evidence to conclude any impact of growth on employment in [[Least developed country|LDCs]] despite some pointing to the positive impact, others point to limitations. They recommended that complementary policies are necessary to ensure economic growth's positive impact on LDC employment. With trade, industry and investment, they only found limited evidence of positive impact on employment from industrial and investment policies and for others, while large bodies of evidence does exist, the exact impact remains contested.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform.org"/&gt;

Researchers have also explored the relationship between employment and illicit activities. Using evidence from Africa, a research team found that a program for Liberian ex-fighters reduced work hours on illicit activities. The employment program also reduced interest in mercenary work in nearby wars. The study concludes that while the use of capital inputs or cash payments for peaceful work created a reduction in illicit activities, the impact of training alone is rather low.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blattman|first=Christopher|last2=Annan|first2=Jeannie|date=2016-02-01|title=Can Employment Reduce Lawlessness and Rebellion?

== Globalization and employment relations ==
The balance of economic efficiency and social equity is the ultimate debate in the field of [[industrial relations|employment relations]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Budd, John W. (2004) ''Employment with a Human Face: Balancing Efficiency, Equity, and Voice'', Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By meeting the needs of the employer; generating profits to establish and maintain economic efficiency; whilst maintaining a balance with the employee and creating social equity that benefits the worker so that he/she can fund and enjoy healthy living; proves to be a continuous revolving issue in westernized societies.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

[[Globalization]] has effected these issues by creating certain economic factors that disallow or allow various employment issues. Economist Edward Lee (1996) studies the effects of globalization and summarizes the four major points of concern that affect employment relations:
# International competition, from the [[newly industrialized countries]], will cause unemployment growth and increased wage disparity for unskilled workers in industrialized countries. Imports from low-wage countries exert pressure on the manufacturing sector in industrialized countries and foreign direct investment (FDI) is attracted away from the industrialized nations, towards low-waged countries.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
# Economic liberalization will result in unemployment and wage inequality in developing countries. This happens as job losses in uncompetitive industries outstrip job opportunities in new industries.
# Workers will be forced to accept worsening wages and conditions, as a global labor market results in a “race to the bottom”. Increased international competition creates a pressure to reduce the wages and conditions of workers.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
# Globalization reduces the autonomy of the nation state. Capital is increasingly mobile and the ability of the state to regulate economic activity is reduced.

What also results from Lee’s (1996) findings is that in industrialized countries an average of almost 70 per cent of workers are employed in the service sector, most of which consists of non-tradable activities. As a result, workers are forced to become more skilled and develop sought after trades, or find other means of survival. Ultimately this is a result of changes and trends of employment, an evolving workforce, and globalization that is represented by a more skilled and increasing highly diverse labor force, that are growing in non standard forms of employment (Markey, R. et al. 2006).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Alternatives==

===Subcultures===
Various youth subcultures have been associated with not working, such as the [[hippie]] subculture in the 1960s and 1970s (which endorsed the idea of "dropping out" of society) and the [[punk subculture]], in which some members live in [[anarchy|anarchist]] [[squatting|squats]] (illegal housing).

===Postsecondary education===
One of the alternatives to work is engaging in postsecondary education at a [[college]], [[university]] or [[professional school]]. One of the major costs of obtaining a postsecondary education is the [[opportunity cost]] of forgone wages due to not working. At times when jobs are hard to find, such as during recessions, unemployed individuals may decide to get postsecondary education, because there is less of an opportunity cost.

===Workplace democracy===
{{main|Workplace democracy}}
Workplace democracy is the application of [[democracy]] in all its forms (including [[voting system]]s, [[debate]]s, [[democratic structuring]], [[due process]], [[adversarial process]], systems of appeal) to the [[wikt:Workplace|workplace]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rayasam|first=Renuka|title=Why Workplace Democracy Can Be Good Business|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2008/04/24/why-workplace-democracy-can-be-good-business.html|accessdate=16 August 2010|newspaper=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]|date=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wolff|first=Richard D. |date=2012 |title=Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism|location= |publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=978-1608462476|author-link=Richard D. Wolff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-employment===
When an individual entirely owns the business for which they labor, this is known as [[self-employment]]. Self-employment often leads to [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]]. Incorporation offers certain protections of one's personal assets.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Individuals who are self-employed may own a [[small business]]. They may also be considered to be an [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]].

===Social assistance===
In some countries, individuals who are not working can receive [[social assistance]] support (e.g., [[welfare]] or [[Food Stamp Program|food stamps]]) to enable them to rent housing, buy food, repair or replace household goods, maintenance of children and observe social customs that require financial expenditure.

===Volunteerism===
Workers who are not paid wages, such as [[Volunteering|volunteers]] who perform tasks for charities, hospitals or not-for-profit organizations, are generally not considered employed. One exception to this is an [[internship]], an employment situation in which the worker receives training or experience (and possibly college credit) as the chief form of compensation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Indentured servitude and slavery===
Those who work under obligation for the purpose of fulfilling a debt, such as [[indentured servant]]s, or as property of the person or entity they work for, such as [[slavery|slaves]], do not receive pay for their services and are not considered employed. Some historians{{which?|date=September 2018}} suggest that slavery is older than employment, but both arrangements have existed for all recorded history.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Indentured servitude and slavery are not considered{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} compatible with [[human rights]] or with [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

'''Enrique Omar Suárez''' is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] union leader, businessman, and politician. He is the previous Secretary General of SOMU (Sindicato de Obreros Marítimos Unidos), the Argentinian union for longshoremen and other maritime workers. He is also the president of Mercante SA and director of Maruba SCA, the largest shipping company in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=¿Quiénes Somos? |work=Maritima Maruba |url=http://www.maruba.com.ar/home.php?pagina=quienesSomos&amp;seccion=quienesSomos&amp;lang=es&amp;editar=false |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629223913/http://www.maruba.com.ar/home.php?pagina=quienesSomos&amp;seccion=quienesSomos&amp;lang=es&amp;editar=false |archivedate=2014-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A longtime friend and ally of the nation’s ruling [[Nestor Kirchner|Kirchner]] family, Suárez has been described as an “ultra-[[Carlos Menem|Menemista]]” who became a “hyper-Kirchnerista.”&lt;ref name="nuestromar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuestromar.org/noticias/transporte_maritimo_y_fluvial_082009_25600_mal_momento_para_maruba|title=Mal momento para Maruba &amp;#124; NUESTROMAR|publisher=nuestromar.org|accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been called a “Cristina-ista.”&lt;ref name=lapolit&gt;{{cite web| title =CGT: "Caballo" Suárez rompió con Moyano y ahora es ultra cristinista| work =La Politica Online| date =Apr 10, 2012| url = http://www.lapoliticaonline.com/nota/60269/}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source identifies him as “President [[Cristina Kirchner]]’s closest and most powerful ally.”&lt;ref name="sela"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sela.org/view/index.asp?ms=258&amp;pagems=26402&amp;item_id=81209|title=SELA - Prensa - Despliegue de Noticias|publisher=sela.org|accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is accused by some sources as having been implicated in killings, shootings, narcotics trafficking, and various underworld activities.

He is widely known by the nickname “Caballo” (horse).&lt;ref name=ieco&gt;{{cite web| last =Rossi| first =Antonio| title =Una marítima holandesa se va del país por presión del gremio| work =Clarin| date =Jun 25, 2011| url = http://www.ieco.clarin.com/empresas/maritima-holandesa-pais-presion-gremio_0_505749666.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
Suárez was born and raised in [[Monte Caseros]], a town in the province of [[Corrientes]], where he grew up in “a humble family.” His father was a carpenter, and his mother a hairdresser. He had two brothers and a sister. His brother Antonio, who was in turn president of the Social Work SOMU and head of the AFJP (Administradoras de Fondos de Jubilaciones y Pensiones) San José, died under “strange” circumstances but was ruled a suicide.&lt;ref name=mtm/&gt;

==Career==
According to an official biographical account, Suárez began to work in SOMU in 1973 and after that worked in “various firms in the sector,” until 1987, when he was elected delegate and secretary of the Closed Section of SOMU. In 1989, he was elected Deputy Secretary General of SOMU, and in 1992 he was elected SOMU’s Secretary General, a position he holds to this day.&lt;ref name=somu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somu.org.ar/detalle.asp?id=39 |title=Enrique Omar Suárez :: S.O.M.U. |publisher=somu.org.ar |accessdate=2014-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714202219/http://www.somu.org.ar/detalle.asp?id=39 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several accounts state that Suárez was the chauffeur for his predecessor as Secretary General of SOMU, [[Juan Arce]], and that he became Secretary General as a result of a 1989 building takeover by “armed thugs” who were members of the union.&lt;ref name=urg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urgente24.com/203601-omar-suarez-el-caballo-antimoyanista?pagination=show|title=Omar Suárez, el &amp;#039;caballo&amp;#039;  antimoyanista &amp;#124; Urgente24|publisher=urgente24.com|accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ambito"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=520963|title=Mar del Plata: mataron al tesorero del gremio pesquero - Ambito.com|publisher=ambito.com|accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; “His arrival in the union was, as is the mark of his entire career, through the gang,” comments one source, which adds that some of the “thugs” that put Suárez in his job continued to work under him, “negotiating with companies and squeezing opponents.”&lt;ref name=pts&gt;{{cite web| last =Aguilar| first =Lucho| title =¿Quién es el ‘Caballo’ Suárez?| work =La Verdad Obrera| date =Nov 15, 2007| url = http://www.pts.org.ar/Quien-es-el-Caballo-Suarez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suárez was a candidate for Provincial Deputy for the New Party.&lt;ref name=mtm/&gt; Businessman [[Adolfo Navajas Artaza]], who was governor of Corrientes in 1969-73 and was denounced for involvement in the disappearance of rural peasants who worked for his company, has been called Suárez’s “political godfather.”&lt;ref name=urg/&gt;

During the Menem years (1989–99), Suárez was “harshly questioned” when he and others signed an agreement on behalf of the Argentine Marines that accepted “poor working conditions” on ships flying under a [[Uruguay]]an [[flag of convenience]].&lt;ref name=period/&gt;

In 2006, Suárez was elected president of the Mutual Association of SOMU. He is also a member of the Commission of Port, Maritime, and River Interests, and is heavily involved in the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Confederation of Labor of the Republic of Argentina (CGT)]]. During his tenure at SOMU, he has also held various positions in the Argentina Confederation of Transport Workers (CATT), the Argentine Maritime Federation (FAMAR), the Caja de Asignaciones Familiares Portuarias y Maritímas (CAFPYMAR) and the Maritime Staff Social Work (OSPM). He is also the founder of la Escuela de Capacitación y Formación Marítima Omar Alberto Rupp, created in 1999 to upgrade the training of maritime workers.&lt;ref name=somu/&gt;

Suárez became director of Maruba in October 2010, after Mercante SA announced that it would acquire a 30% stake in the firm, pending government approval.&lt;ref name=period/&gt;

Suárez has been criticized for signing agreements that resulted in lower wages and poorer working conditions and for spending $1.5 million on a recreational camp for union leaders, El Progreso, to which maritime workers are forbidden access.&lt;ref name=pts/&gt;

A 2011 investigative report accused Suárez of having “invented” much of his past, and maintained that it was “a challenge” to determine his actual work history.&lt;ref name=period/&gt;

===Smith International, 2010===
After Suárez became director of Maruba in October 2010, he used his position at SOMU to launch “a strong attack” on other companies in the sector, pressuring union shippers in the port of [[Buenos Aires]] to hire Maruba’s tugboats instead of those belonging to the Dutch firm [[Smith International]]. Smith complained to [[Ricardo Lujan]] of the Secretariat for Ports and Waterways, but he refused to act against Suárez. Smith backed off from operations in Buenos Aires and sought instead to increase its presence in the port of [[Bahía Blanca]], but Suárez then put on the pressure there, engineering strikes that made it impossible for Smith to meet its contracts; ultimately, Smith withdrew entirely from the Argentinian market. Its disappearance from Bahía Blanca improved the fortunes of local competitors but the port lost half of its tugboats, which increased the likelihood of delays.&lt;ref name=ieco/&gt;

===Blockade, 2010===
In late 2010, SOMU blockaded [[Paraguay]]an trade in the port of Buenos Aires, and consequently about 7000 containers in transit to Paraguay had to wait nearly a month to be shipped to their destinations. Suárez said that SOMU had “the full support of the Cristina Kirchner administration” in implementing the blockade. He said that it was “a Kirchner government strategy to have Argentine pre-eminence in the Paraná-Paraguay river system”&lt;ref name="mercopress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2010/12/13/president-lugo-confirms-he-will-not-attend-the-mercosur-summit|title=President Lugo confirms he will not attend the Mercosur summit &amp;mdash; MercoPress|publisher=en.mercopress.com|accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner had in fact “explicitly called for a boycott for five days in a gesture of solidarity” with Paraguayan maritime workers.

Suárez later denied having stated that the president supported the boycott. “I never said that. Clarín misrepresented my words," he maintained, and claimed that, on the contrary, he had told Clarín “that the president asked us to lift the blockade.” He said that the blockade had been undertaken in solidarity with Paraguayan maritime workers, because Paraguayan vessels “do not respect minimum and decent working conditions set out in international standards.” The Paraguayan counterpart to SOMU, however, announced that it was opposed to the blockade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloggingsbyboz.com/2011/08/argentine-unions-blockade-paraguayan.html|title=Bloggings by boz: Argentine unions blockade Paraguayan cargo ships|publisher=Bloggingsbyboz.com|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blockade threat, 2011===
In the summer of 2011, Suárez threatened to blockade Paraguayan shipping to overcome “wage asymmetry” in Mercosur and “asymmetry in navigation” on the Paraná. The real goal of Suárez and the Argentinian government, it was claimed, was to compel shippers to switch several billion dollars’ worth of freight from Paraguayan firms to Maruba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eldiario.tristangrimaux.com/id/344318 |title=Omar Suárez y Cristina Kirchner Z - La Nación.com.py |publisher=Eldiario.tristangrimaux.com |accessdate=25 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715003639/http://eldiario.tristangrimaux.com/id/344318 |archivedate=15 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bianchi criticisms, 2011===
In September 2011, [[Ivana Maria Bianchi]], a member of the Argentinian Chamber of Deputies, filed a document with the Chamber of Deputies requesting an investigation of Suárez, listing several charges against him. According to Bianchi, Suárez had “launched a powerful attack against shipping, oil and grain” to promote SOMU and Maruba; had unsettled “the waters and the rules of the local maritime sector” with the support of the government of Christina Fernández de Kirchner; had frequently boasted that “everything that moves over the water is mine”; had “carried out a prolonged assault on the fishing industry in Mar del Plata” in 2008 in an effort to force it to yield to union demands; had pressured Maruba’s competitors to cede business to it; had benefited from government favoritism in matters ranging from permits to contracts; and had “loot[ed] the coffers of the National Bank” to increase Argentinian shipbuilding and heighten the Argentinian maritime presence around the globe. Bianchi noted that Maruba, formerly “a company in deep economic problems,” had quickly turned successful as a result of government support, despite owning “virtually no Argentinian vessels” and having debts in ports around the world. Bianchi called Suárez “the most visible and militant face of the merchant marine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.hcdn.gov.ar/proyxml/expediente.asp?fundamentos=si&amp;numexp=4694-D-2011 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140717145015/http://www1.hcdn.gov.ar/proyxml/expediente.asp?fundamentos=si&amp;numexp=4694-D-2011 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 July 2014 |title=H.Cámara de Diputados de la Nación : PROYECTO DE RESOLUCIÓN |publisher=Hcdn.gov.ar |accessdate=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strike, 2012===
SOMU called a strike on March 6, 2012, demanding higher staffing levels. “We don’t have anything to negotiate,” said Suárez. “They either assign the number of crew members that are necessary or the coast guard can do the work.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2012/03/wkrs-m13.html|title=Workers Struggles: The Americas - World Socialist Web Site|date=13 March 2012|publisher=Wsws.org|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the strike paralyzed maritime operations in Argentina, Suárez said: “Not one ship more will enter or leave.” As a result of the strike, [[soy]] futures soared on the [[Chicago Board of Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL2E8E617020120306|title=UPDATE 2-Argentine dock strike halts scores of grains ships|publisher=Af.reuters.com|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.K. boycott, 2012===
In February 2012, Suárez announced that SOMU would “cease to provide services to [[U.K.]] vessels as well as those of other nations hired by U.K.-based shipping companies,” owing to escalating tensions between Argentina and the U.K. over the [[Falkland Islands]]. “As workers we are totally offended by...the militarization of the South Atlantic,” Suárez said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/argentina-unions-threaten-boycott-of-uk-vessels-2012-02-14|title=Argentina unions threaten boycott of U.K. vessels|author=Ken Parks|work=MarketWatch|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
Suárez has been described as being responsible for “a lush handbook of deaths, drugs, and corruption.” When [[Eduardo Galantini]] was mayor of Monte Caseros, he was reportedly “threatened with death” because the municipality held land that was “coveted by Suárez.”&lt;ref name=mtm/&gt;

Suárez reportedly played a key role in Kirchnerist businessman [[Cristóbal López (businessman)|Cristóbal López]]’s development of a nationwide gambling empire.&lt;ref name=period/&gt;

Politician, businessman, and union leader Luis Barrionuevo reportedly financed Suárez’s “Proyecto Corrientes,” a [[Juan Peron|Peronist]] political organization in Suárez’s home province.&lt;ref name=mtm/&gt;

===Papal visit, 2013===
Suárez was one of ten or so members of the delegation that accompanied Cristina Fernández de Kirchner to [[Rome]] to meet with [[Pope Francis]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/126681/cristina-kirchner-to-meet-pope-francis|title=Cristina Kirchner to meet Pope Francis|publisher=Buenosairesherald.com|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with the Kirchners==
Suárez and leaders of three other unions agreed in 2006 “to unify their efforts to support and deepen the national recovery policy promoted by the government of President [[Néstor Kirchner]].” Suárez himself stated that the four unions were “in full accordance with the national direction of economic and social policy of President Néstor Kirchner and in full service to the reconstruction of the Argentine maritime sector.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuestromar.org/noticias/politica_y_economia092006_omar_suarez_lo_que_acordamos_fue_la_unidad_total_del_sector_mari|title=Omar Suárez: "Lo que acordamos fue la unidad total del sector marítimos"|publisher=Nuestromar.org|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suárez said that “the unity of the major world trade unions” was “terrible news for the nostalgia of [[neoliberalism]]” and represented a success for the economic and social strategy of President Kirchner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laautenticadefensa.net/41059|title=OMAR SUAREZ: APOYAMOS FIRMEMENTE LA CONDUCCION DE HUGO MOYANO AL FRENTE DE LA CGT|author=MatrixWay|work=La Auténtica Defensa|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayor Javier Iud of San Antonio said in 2007 that it was important to work closely with Suárez on local issues because Suárez is “a ‘soldier’ of Cristina” and an “unconditional ally of CGT as he was under Néstor Kirchner.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://informativohoy.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18:vxk47&amp;catid=60:archivo|title=Iud y Gustavo Rubio se reunieron con Omar Suarez por la problemática pesquera|author=Administrator|publisher=Informativohoy.com.ar|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One source wrote in 2008 that Suárez was “now identified with Kirchner to the point that in the early months of the presidential campaign, he decorated the port area…with slogans reading ‘With him or with her, Kirchner president, SOMU driving. Omar Suárez.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavaca.org/notas/el-conflicto-del-casino-el-gremialismo-antisindical/|title=El conflicto del casino: el gremialismo antisindical|work=lavaca|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suárez took part in a labor-union tribute to Néstor Kirchner on the first anniversary of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sutpa.org/2011/10/28/homenaje-a-nestor-kirchner-en-la-cgt/|title=Homenaje a Néstor Kirchner en la CGT|publisher=Sutpa.org|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suárez said in May 2011 that Argentina’s “historic” maritime presence around the world was a sign of "the remarkable recovery of Argentina at the hands of our President, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner,” and was proof that “the Argentine people need four more years of Cristina.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corrienteshoy.com/vernota.asp?id_noticia=79310#.U7R3k_mSyfM|title=Omar Suárez: Los argentinos quieren cuatro años más de Cristina Kirchner|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Corrienteshoy.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025164625/http://corrienteshoy.com/vernota.asp?id_noticia=79310|archivedate=25 October 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=25 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suárez stated in April 2012 that in the elections for head of the CGT, scheduled for 2013, he would vote for the Kirchner candidate, not for current CGT leader Hugo Moyano, from whom, it was reported, he had recently been maintaining a “certain distance.”&lt;ref name=lapolit/&gt;

Suárez stated in March 2014 that his goal as head of SOMU is “to recover a Néstor Kirchner Argentina that is a matrix of energy and development.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agepeba.org/lectura.asp?id=10671|title=Tras una reunión de trabajo, el titular de SOMU afirmó que Mariotto 'tiene toda la aptitud para ser Gobernador'|last=|first=|date=21 March 2014|website=|publisher=Agepeba.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193628/http://agepeba.org/lectura.asp?id=10671|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=yes|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suárez has been described as using his contacts with the [[Casa Rosada]] to obtain credit at the National Bank to purchase ships from [[China]].&lt;ref name=period/&gt;

Nowadays he is in jail in Marcos Paz facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tn.com.ar/politica/el-sindicalista-omar-caballo-suarez-seguira-detenido_723172 |title=El sindicalista Omar Caballo Suarez seguira detenido|publisher=tn.com.ar|accessdate=14 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary economics deals with the study of processes that transform economy for firms, institutions, industries, employment, production, trade and growth within, through the actions of diverse agents from experience and interactions, using evolutionary methodology&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, E.S., 2013. Evolutionary economics: post-Schumpeterian contributions. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2012. Options for moving beyond the canonical model of regional path dependence. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 36(1), pp.172-178. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01090.x/full 
&lt;/ref&gt;. Evolutionary economics analyses the unleashing of a process of technological and institutional innovation by generating and testing a diversity of ideas which discover and accumulate more survival value for the costs incurred than competing alternatives. The evidence suggests that it could be [[Adaptive market hypothesis|adaptive efficiency]] that defines economic efficiency. [[Mainstream economics|Mainstream]] economic reasoning begins with the postulates of [[scarcity]] and [[rational agent]]s (that is, agents modeled as maximizing their individual welfare), with the "[[rational choice]]" for any agent being a straightforward  [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] in [[mathematical optimization]]. There has been renewed interest in treating economic systems as evolutionary systems in the developing field of [[Complexity economics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Evolutionary economics does not take the characteristics of either the objects of choice or of the decision-maker as fixed. Rather its focus is on the non-equilibrium ''processes'' that transform the economy ''from within'' and their implications&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R. and Winter, S.G., 2002. Evolutionary theorizing in economics. The journal of economic perspectives, 16(2), pp.23-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2012. Options for moving beyond the canonical model of regional path dependence. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 36(1), pp.172-178. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01090.x/full 
&lt;/ref&gt;.  The processes in turn emerge from actions of diverse agents with [[bounded rationality]] who may learn from experience and interactions and whose differences contribute to the change.  The subject draws more recently on [[evolutionary game theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Friedman (1998).  "On Economic Applications of Evolutionary Game Theory," ''Journal of Evolutionary Economics'', 8(1), pp. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p62cu1yy9tkljh5l/ 15]-43.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the [[evolution]]ary methodology of [[Charles Darwin]] and the [[non-equilibrium economics]] principle of circular and cumulative causation. It is [[Natural science|naturalistic]] in purging earlier notions of economic change as [[teleology|teleological]] or necessarily improving the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Witt (2008). "evolutionary economics." ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, v. 3,  pp. 67-68 [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000295&amp;q=evolutinary%20economics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A different approach is to apply [[evolutionary psychology]] principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in [[rational choice theory]]. Basic economic concepts such as [[utility]] may be better viewed as due to preferences that maximized evolutionary [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Paul H.

==Predecessors==
In the mid-19th century, [[Karl Marx]] presented a schema of stages of historical development, by introducing the notion that [[human nature]] was not constant and was not determinative of the nature of the social system; on the contrary, he made it a principle that human behavior was a function of the social and economic system in which it occurred.

Marx based his theory of economic development on the premise of developing [[economic system]]s; specifically, over the course of history superior economic systems would replace inferior ones. Inferior systems were beset by internal contradictions and [[Inefficiency|inefficiencies]] that make them incapable of surviving over the long term. In Marx's scheme, [[feudalism]] was replaced by [[capitalism]], which would eventually be superseded by [[socialism]].&lt;ref name="ComparingEconomicSystems"&gt;''Gregory and Stuart''. (2005) ''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', Seventh Edition, South-Western College Publishing, {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At approximately the same time, [[Charles Darwin]] developed a general framework for comprehending any process whereby small, [[random variation]]s could accumulate and predominate over time into large-scale changes that resulted in the emergence of wholly novel forms ("[[speciation]]").

This was followed shortly after by the work of the American pragmatic philosophers ([[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]], [[William James|James]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]]) and the founding of two new disciplines, [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]], both of which were oriented toward cataloging and developing explanatory frameworks for the variety of [[behavior]] patterns (both individual and collective) that were becoming increasingly obvious to all systematic observers. The state of the world converged with the state of the evidence to make almost inevitable the development of a more "modern" framework for the analysis of substantive economic issues.

=== Veblen (1898) ===

[[Thorstein Veblen]] (1898) coined the term "evolutionary economics" in English. He began his career in the midst of this period of intellectual ferment, and as a young scholar came into direct contact with some of the leading figures of the various movements that were to shape the style and substance of [[social science]]s into the next century and beyond. Veblen saw the need for taking account of cultural variation in his approach; no universal "human nature" could possibly be invoked to explain the variety of norms and behaviors that the new science of anthropology showed to be the rule, rather than the exception. He emphasised the conflict between "industrial" and "pecuniary" or ceremonial values and this [[Veblenian dichotomy]] was interpreted in the hands of later writers as the "ceremonial / instrumental dichotomy" (Hodgson 2004);

Veblen saw that every culture is materially based and dependent on tools and skills to support the "life process", while at the same time, every culture appeared to have a stratified structure of status ("invidious distinctions") that ran entirely contrary to the imperatives of the "instrumental" (read: "technological") aspects of group life. The "ceremonial" was related to the past, and conformed to and supported the tribal legends; "instrumental" was oriented toward the technological imperative to judge value by the ability to control future consequences. The "Veblenian dichotomy" was a specialized variant of the "[[Instrumentalism|instrumental]] theory of value" due to John Dewey, with whom Veblen was to make contact briefly at the [[University of Chicago]].

Arguably the most important works by Veblen include, but are not restricted to, his most famous works (''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]''; ''[[The Theory of Business Enterprise]]''), but his monograph ''Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution'' and the 1898 essay entitled ''Why is Economics not an Evolutionary Science'' have both been influential in shaping the research agenda for subsequent generations of [[social scientist]]s. TOLC and TOBE together constitute an alternative construction to the neoclassical marginalist theories of consumption and production, respectively.

Both are founded on his dichotomy, which is at its core a valuational principle. The ceremonial patterns of activity are not bound to any past, but to one that generated a specific set of advantages and prejudices that underlie the current institutions. "Instrumental" judgments create benefits according to a new criterion, and therefore are inherently subversive. This line of analysis was more fully and explicitly developed by [[Clarence E. Ayres]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]] from the 1920s.

A seminal article by [[Armen Alchian]] (1950) argued for adaptive success of firms faced with uncertainty and incomplete information replacing [[profit maximization]] as an appropriate modeling assumption.&lt;ref&gt;Armen A. Alchian 1950, "Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory," ''Journal of Political Economy'', 58(3), pp. [http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/syllabi/Econ811JournalArticles/AlchianJPE.pdf 211-21].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Boulding]] was one of the advocates of the evolutionary methods in social science, as is evident from [[Kenneth Boulding's Evolutionary Perspective]]. [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Ronald Coase]] and [[Douglass North]] are some of the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] winners who are known for their sympathy to the field.

More narrowly the works [[Jack Downie]]&lt;ref&gt;Jack Downie (1958) The Competitive Process&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edith Penrose]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Penrose (1959) The Theory of the Growth of the Firm&lt;/ref&gt; offer many insights for those thinking about evolution at the level of the firm in an industry.

[[Joseph Schumpeter]], who lived in the first half of 20th century, was the author of the book ''The Theory of Economic Development'' (1911, transl. 1934). It is important to note that for the word ''development'' he used in his native language, the German word "Entwicklung", which can be translated as development or evolution. The translators of the day used the word "development" from the French "développement", as opposed to "evolution" as this was used by Darwin. (Schumpeter, in his later writings in English as a professor at Harvard, used the word "evolution".)  The current term in common use is [[economic development]].

In Schumpeter's book he proposed an idea radical for its time: the evolutionary perspective. He based his theory on the assumption of usual [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], which is something like "the normal mode of economic affairs". This equilibrium is being perpetually destroyed by [[entrepreneur]]s who try to introduce [[innovation]]s. A successful introduction of an innovation (i.e. a [[disruptive technology]]) disturbs the normal flow of economic life, because it forces some of the already existing technologies and means of production to lose their positions within the economy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

== Present state of discussion ==
One of the major contributions to the emerging field of evolutionary economics has been the publication of ''An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change'' by [[Richard R. Nelson (economist)|Richard Nelson]] and [[Sidney G. Winter]]. These authors have focused mostly on the issue of changes in [[technology]] and [[Business process|routines]], suggesting a framework for their analysis. If the change occurs constantly in the economy, then some kind of evolutionary process must be in action, and there has been a proposal that this process is [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] in nature.

Then, mechanisms that provide [[Selection (biology)|selection]], generate [[Genetic variation|variation]] and establish [[self-replication]], must be identified. The authors introduced the term '[[steady change]]' to highlight the evolutionary aspect of economic processes and contrast it with the concept of '[[steady state]]' popular in [[classical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steady change]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their approach can be compared and contrasted with the [[population ecology]] or [[organizational ecology]] approach in sociology: see Douma &amp; Schreuder (2013, chapter 11).

[[Milton Friedman]] proposed that [[Market (economics)|market]]s act as major selection vehicles. As [[corporation|firm]]s compete, unsuccessful rivals fail to capture an appropriate [[market share]], go [[bankrupt]] and have to exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Mariana Mazzucato |last=Mazzucato |first=Mariana |url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/22206/ |year=2000 |title=Firm Size, Innovation and Market Structure: The Evolution of Market Concentration and Instability |journal=Advances in Complex Systems |volume=3 |pages=417–431 |publisher=Edward Elgar |location=Northampton, MA |isbn=978-1-84064-346-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of competing firms is both in their products and practices, that are matched against markets. Both products and practices are determined by routines that firms use: standardized patterns of actions implemented constantly. By imitating these routines, firms propagate them and thus establish inheritance of successful practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton Friedman|Friedman, Milton]] (1953). ''[[Essays in Positive Economics]]'', University of Chicago Press. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rSGekjfpf4cC&amp;printsec=toc&amp;dq=friedman+essays&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 Chapter preview links.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 251: [[Jon Elster]], ''Explaining Technical Change : a Case Study in the Philosophy of Science'', Second ed.&lt;/ref&gt;
A general theory of this process has been proposed by Kurt Dopfer, John Foster and Jason Potts as the micro meso macro framework.&lt;ref&gt;Dopfer, K., Foster, J., Potts, J. (2004). Micro-meso-macro. Journal of Evolutionary Economics. 14(3), 263-279&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic processes, as part of life processes, are intrinsically evolutionary&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R. and Winter, S.G., 2002. Evolutionary theorizing in economics. The journal of economic perspectives, 16(2), pp.23-46.&lt;/ref&gt;. From the evolutionary equation that describe life processes, an analytical formula on the main factors of economic processes, such as fixed cost and variable cost, can be derived. The economic return, or competitiveness, of economic entities of different characteristics under different kinds of environment can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last=Chen|first=Jing|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=|location=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change of environment causes the change of competitiveness of different economic entities and systems. This is the process of evolution of economic systems.

In recent years, evolutionary models have been used to assist decision making in applied settings and find solutions to problems such as optimal product design and service portfolio diversification.&lt;ref&gt;Baltas, G., Tsafarakis, S., Saridakis, C. &amp; Matsatsinis, N. (2013). Biologically Inspired Approaches to Strategic Service Design: Optimal Service Diversification Through Evolutionary and Swarm Intelligence Models. ''Journal of Service Research'' 16 (2), 186-201&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary psychology ==
{{See also|Behavioral economics|Neuroeconomics}}
A different approach is to apply [[evolutionary psychology]] principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in [[rational choice theory]]. A basic economic concept such as [[utility]] may be better viewed as due to preferences that maximized evolutionary [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one. [[Loss aversion]] may be explained as being rational when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may have meant death and it thus may have been rational to place a greater value on losses than on gains.&lt;ref name="AEP"/&gt;

People are sometimes more cooperative and altruistic than predicted by economic theory which may be explained by mechanisms such as [[reciprocal altruism]] and [[group selection]] for cooperative behavior. An evolutionary approach may also explain differences between groups such as males being less risk-averse than females since males have more variable [[reproductive success]] than females. While unsuccessful risk-seeking may limit reproductive success for both sexes, males may potentially increase their reproductive success much more than females from successful risk-seeking. [[Frequency-dependent selection]] may explain why people differ in characteristics such as cooperative behavior with cheating becoming an increasingly less successful strategy as the numbers of cheaters increase.&lt;ref name="AEP"/&gt;

Another argument is that humans have a poor intuitive grasp of the economics of the current environment which is very different from the ancestral environment. The ancestral environment likely had relatively little [[trade]], [[division of labor]], and [[capital good]]s. Technological change was very slow, wealth differences were much smaller, and possession of many available resources were likely [[zero-sum]] games where large inequalities were caused by various forms of exploitation. Humans therefore may have poor intuitive understanding the benefits of [[free trade]] (causing calls for [[protectionism]]), the value of capital goods (making the [[labor theory of value]] appealing), and may intuitively undervalue the benefits of technological development.&lt;ref name="AEP"/&gt;

There may be a tendency to see the number of available jobs as a zero-sum game with the total number of jobs being fixed which causes people to not realize that [[minimum wage]] laws reduce the number of jobs or to believe that an increased number of jobs in other nations necessarily decreases the number of jobs in their own nation. Large [[income inequality]] may easily be viewed as due to exploitation rather than as due to individual differences in [[productivity]]. This may easily cause poor economic policies, especially since individual voters have few incentives to make the effort of studying societal economics instead of relying on their intuitions since an individual's vote counts for so little and since politicians may be reluctant to take a stand against intuitive views that are incorrect but widely held.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Family Computer Network System'''|ファミリーコンピュータ ネットワークシステム|Famirī Konpyūta Nettowāku Shisutemu|lead=yes}}, also known as the '''Famicom Net System''' or '''Famicom Modem''', is a video game peripheral for Nintendo's [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]], released in September 1988 only in Japan. It uses a card based format, reminiscent to the [[HuCard]] for [[Hudson Soft]]'s and [[NEC]]'s [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] or the [[Sega Card]] for the [[Master System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/oroti/famicom/ish11.html |title=ファミコンの周辺機器が大集合! ザ☆周辺機器ズ 11 |publisher=Ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2006/03/25/103,1143298259,50588,0,0.html Wi-Fiコネクションについて講演　『ウイイレ』など40タイトルが開発中]''. [[Famitsu]]. 25 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It allowed the user access to a server that provided live stock trades, [[cheating in video games|game cheats]], jokes, weather forecasts, horse betting, and a small amount of downloadable content.&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"&gt;{{ cite magazine | first=Masaharu | last=Takano | title=How the Famicom Modem was Born | others=[http://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/how-the-famicom-was-born/developing-the-famicom-modem/ English translation by GlitterBerri] | date=September 11, 1995 | magazine=Nikkei Electronics | language=Japanese }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience Nintendo gained with this endeavor led directly to the deployment of the satellite based [[Satellaview]] network for the [[Super Famicom]] in the early 1990s.  Nintendo would eventually engage in Internet based networking, via the [[64DD]] and its accompanying Randnet service, the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], the [[Nintendo GameCube–Game Boy Advance cable|Game Boy Advance Cable]], the Nintendo DS's DS Download Play, the Wii's [[WiiConnect24]] and its shop, the [[Nintendo DSi]]'s DSi Shop, and the [[Nintendo Network]] for the [[Nintendo 3DS]], [[Wii U]], and [[Nintendo Switch | Switch]].

==History==
===Development===
Beginning in mid-1987, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi requested the exploration of a partnership with the [[Nomura Securities]] financial company, to create an information network service in Japan based on the Famicom.  Led by Masayuki Uemura, [[Nintendo Research &amp; Development 2]] developed the modem hardware; and Nomura Securities developed the client and server software and the information database. Uemura cautioned that they "weren't confident that they would be able to make network games entertaining".  Five unreleased prototypes of network-enabled games were developed for the system, including Yamauchi's favorite classic, [[Go (game)|Go]].&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"/&gt;

===Production===
[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Modem-Network-System-04.jpg|thumb|right|The telephone line connectors on the bottom of the modem.]]
[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Modem-Controller.jpg|thumb|right|The controller included with the modem.]]
The Famicom Modem began mass production in September 1988. The accompanying proprietary online service was soon launched the same year alongside [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]]'s new DDX-TP telephone gateway for its existing packet switched network.  NTT's launch initially suffered reliability problems that were painstakingly assessed by Nintendo at individual users' homes and traced back to the network.&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"/&gt;

Nintendo's sole final application of the Famicom Modem was the 1991 system called Super Mario Club.  It was formed for toy shops, where the Famicom was deployed as a networked arcade kiosk, serving consumers with a member-store-created searchable online database of Famicom game reviews. Nintendo performed market research by analyzing users' search behaviors, and directly received user feedback messages.&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"/&gt;

In June 1989, Nintendo of America's vice president of marketing Peter Main, said that the Famicom was present in 37% of Japan's households and that its interactive game and stock network based upon the Famicom Modem had been running for some time.&lt;ref name="How Nintendo Can Help A.T.&amp;T"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=International New York Times | issn=0362-4331 | title=Talking Deals; How Nintendo Can Help A.T.&amp;T. | first=Michael | last=Freitag | date=June 8, 1989 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/08/business/talking-deals-how-nintendo-can-help-at-t.html | accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Modem-Network-System-Horse-Betting.jpg|thumb|right|The software card for the horse betting program.]]
Nintendo shipped a lifetime total of 130,000 Famicom Modems. Even after the resolution of stability problems with the NTT's network launch, the Famicom Modem market presence was considered "weak" for its whole lifetime for various reasons: product usability; competition from personal computers and other appliances; and the difficult nature of early adoption by the technologically unsavvy financial customer. Uemura stated that the system's most popular application was ultimately home-based horse race betting, with a peak of 100,000 units used and capturing 35% of the online horse betting market even amongst diverse competition from PCs and from dedicated horse betting network terminal appliances.&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"/&gt;

===Legacy===
Wanting to replicate and expand upon the progress seen with the Famicom Modem in Japan, Nintendo of America began a series of open announcements in mid-1989 to describe its private talks with AT&amp;T over the prospect of launching an information network service in America in 1990.&lt;ref name="How Nintendo Can Help A.T.&amp;T"/&gt;  The plans never materialized.

A modem for NES was tested in the United States by the [[Minnesota State Lottery]]. It would have allowed players to buy [[scratchcard]]s and play the lottery with their NES at home. It was not released in the United States because some parents and legislators voiced concern that minors might learn to play the lottery illegally and anonymously, regardless of assurances from Nintendo to the contrary.&lt;ref name="lottery"&gt;{{cite news |title= Nintendo and Minnesota Set A Living-Room Lottery Test|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/27/business/nintendo-and-minnesota-set-a-living-room-lottery-test.html|accessdate=2008-02-16|date =1991-09-27|work=New York Times | first=Eben | last=Shapiro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet-based gambling was banned in Minnesota.&lt;ref name="Minnesota Gambling and Criminal Defense"&gt;{{cite web | title=Minnesota Gambling and Criminal Defense | url=http://www.nvo.com/beaulier/minnesotagamblingcrimes/ | accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online content would later be delivered to Nintendo's customers via the [[Super Famicom]]'s [[Satellaview]] peripheral. Masayuki Uemura, lead designer of the Famicom Modem at [[Nintendo Research &amp; Development 2]], said: "Our experiences with the Famicom Modem triggered Nintendo’s entrance into the satellite data broadcasting market in April, 1995".&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"/&gt;

A '''general assignment or assignment''' is a concept in [[bankruptcy law]] that has a similar meaning, due to common law ancestry, in different jurisdictions, but wide dispersion in practical application. The "assignment for the benefit of creditors", also known as an ABC or AFBC is an alternative to bankruptcy, which is a "general assignment"/"assignment" concept.

==The United States==
In the [[United states]], a general assignment or an assignment for the benefit of creditors is simply a contract whereby the insolvent entity ("Assignor") transfers legal and equitable title, as well as custody and control of its property, to a third party ("Assignee") in trust, to apply the proceeds of sale to the assignor's creditors in accord with priorities established by law.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

An assignment for the benefit of creditors is a relatively well-established common law tool and is one alternative to a bankruptcy. An assignment for the benefit of creditors is designed to save time and expense by concluding the affairs of a bankrupt company. The assignment for the benefit of creditors is a state form of bankruptcy action versus a federal form of bankruptcy action. The assignment for the benefit of creditor’s process is similar in character to a [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] bankruptcy and parallels some of the same procedures, but is not an actual "bankruptcy" in the form the word is used in the United States.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

===Mechanism===
The assignment for the benefit of creditors is a common law contract between the board of directors and the assignee in which the board "assigns" the assets and liabilities of the company to the assignee, a third party. The assignment for the benefit of creditors contract is usually recorded the public record at a town, a city, a county or a state level. Each state will differ on recording requirements for the assignment for the benefit of creditors contract.{{fact|date=January 2016}} 

The physical filing of the assignment usually occurs after: the board of directors has spoken with local insolvency counsel; a board of directors authorization of some nature has been enacted; an appropriate assignee chosen; and the contract has been written. The assignee's primary goal is to try to make the creditors whole. The assignee performs duties similar to a trustee under federal bankruptcy. The assignee has a similar, if not equivalent, fiduciary role as the bankruptcy trustee. The assignee has the primary responsibility to: liquidate the assets of the company; vette creditor claims; and issue a dividend to the creditors. The creditors are the assignee's top priority, not shareholders. Shareholders by definition have a residual claim on assets once all creditors are satisfied.{{fact|date=January 2016}} 

The assignee, once the assignment process is completed, issues a dividend. The dividend is derived from the sale of assets, collection of receivables, recovery of the bankrupt company’s assets and cash. Certain creditors may or may not receive a dividend. The assignee's hope is to provide a one-to-one redemption of the creditor’s claims; however, this depends on the amount of cash an assignee can marshal in the liquidation process.{{fact|date=January 2016}} 

The claims process is similar to a standard bankruptcy action in which creditors submit claims to the assignee for review and acceptance. The acceptance and vetting of claims is an important process to ensure that no one creditor has overstated their claim. There are rare occasions in which an assignee may issue a non-cash dividend as part of the overall dividend to creditors on their claims, but a dividend of this type is not common. If all the creditors are made whole, shareholders would then have a claim on the remainder of the dividend. This holds true only if there are no other classes of equity that have priority senior to the shareholders.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

The order of creditor’s claims usually follows the normal bankruptcy order prescribed in [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|a Chapter 7 bankruptcy]], generally secured, and unsecured in descending order. The assignee, depending on the specific state law may use [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code]] as needed. Neither the federal bankruptcy court nor a state court usually oversee this process, however the assignee is subject in most cases to a look back provision within the state the assignment took place.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

A Federal Bankruptcy Court judge in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy must approve the sale of the bankrupt company's assets, thus adding time and expense on to the entire liquidation process. The assets sold in an assignment for the benefit of creditor process do not usually require a judge's intervention. It is this removal of the court from the liquidation process which increases the speed of the assets sold in an assignment process. This is one substantial difference from a regular bankruptcy.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

===Creditors===
Secured and unsecured creditors constitute the creditor body. Both secured and unsecured creditors are ahead of shareholders as noted earlier. A secured creditor is a creditor, who has a priority claim on an asset or assets of a company. A lien on the specific asset or assets places the secured creditor's claim ahead of the unsecured creditor. Once a secured creditor is satisfied, the unsecured creditor is then the next priority. This is again the normal order of priority in a bankruptcy.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

===Secured creditor influence===
If there has been a determination by company management and interested parties such as a secured creditor that even after restructuring, a "going concern" may still not viable. A secured creditor or group of secured creditors frequently may encourage the company's senior management to pursue this liquidation mechanism. Secured creditor(s) may encourage this type of action to relieve themselves of the legal costs and risks associated with the [[foreclosure]] and sale of its [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. One specific risk a secured creditor wants to avoid is preference or the perception of preference in the liquidation process (see [[fraudulent transfer]]).{{fact|date=January 2016}} 

In situations where the liquidation value of the assets exceeds a secured creditor's [[lien]], the assignee is not normally required to obtain the consent of a [[secured creditor]] or any other creditor prior to the assignment process. Cooperation of the secured creditor may however affect the assignee's ability to liquidate an asset. An assignee in practice may obtain the consent of the secured creditors in advance of the assignment to ensure that the assignee can liquidate the asset or assets in a timely manner without a secured party stopping or holding up the assignment process. Secured party consent in this case is optional, not necessary.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

In situations where the liquidation value of the assets is less than a secured creditor's lien, the assignment process can be done, however a vast number of legal questions need to be reconciled before the assignment process can possibly be initiated. There unfortunately is no concise answer in this particular situation.{{fact|date=January 2016}}   

Secured creditors may in certain instances assume the senior management roles within the bankrupt company, however noted earlier this situation occurs when the secured creditor(s) have [[foreclosed]] on their [[lien]]. Large secured creditors again may influence the decision making process, but that [[secured creditor]] can not enter into that contract on behalf of the bankrupt company. Only the bankrupt company's senior management and/or board of directors have the power to do an assignment.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

===Dividend===
The dividend is hopefully the payout that the assignee issues, once all creditors' claims have been vetted and all the assets have been sold. The assignee hopes to generate enough cash to provide a one for one redemption of a creditor's claims. This is the hope the reality varies vastly, depending on the price the assets fetched when sold. Most dividends are in the form of cash back to the creditor, but not necessarily all. There may not even be a dividend in certain instance, thus no creditor receives any payment. There is no way to determine the cash value of an asset in the assignment process, regardless of past estimates. Tangible assets cash value can usually, but not always, be reasonably estimated. Intangible assets such as intellectual property or processes are much more difficult to evaluate.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

===Key attributes of the process===
Noted earlier this is a state form of bankruptcy, not federal form. The assignment process or any bankruptcy process for that matter is a legal matter. The state attributes of an assignment process may be understood by any attorney however a local/regional bankruptcy attorney in the specific state usually is best equipped to handle the legal end of the process for the company making the assignment. This is not asserted to diminish an attorney’s capabilities, but to stress the legal niche that this legal instrument falls within, bankruptcy. Non legal staff familiar with bankruptcy and the assignment process can also affect the speed validity of the process.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

===General assignment attributes===
The general rule is that any [[debtor]] may make an assignment.  This would include any individual, [[partnership]], [[corporation]] or limited liability company that owes anything to anyone.  Any debtor owning property has the common law right to make an assignment.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

==Other common law countries==
In other common law countries, general assignments usually refer to any general assignment of existing or future book debts by a natural person (including, in some cases, partnerships).  A general assignment made by a natural person who is subsequently adjudged bankrupt is [[void (law)|void]] against the trustee in bankruptcy as regards any book debts which have not been paid prior to the presentation of the bankruptcy petition. {{fact|date=January 2016}}

The definition of book debts includes "debts which in the ordinary course of business would be entered in a well-kept trade book",&lt;ref&gt;''Re Shipley v Marshall'' [1863] 4 C.B. 566&lt;/ref&gt; future debts and future rents under a [[hire purchase]] agreement.  [[Bill of exchange|Bills of exchange]] also fall within the definition of book debts,&lt;ref&gt;''Re Siebe Gorman v Barclays Bank Plc'' [1979] 2 Lloyds Rep 142&lt;/ref&gt; but a bank balance does not.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Brightlife Ltd'' [1987] 1 Ch 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Under (for example) [[English law]], any general assignment, either absolute or by way of security, of book debts is void unless registered under the Bills of Sale Act 1878.   A trustee would not be able to attack an assignment under this section which relates to debts due from specified debtors or debts becoming due under specified contracts or where the debts were assigned as part of a ''[[bona fide]]'' transfer of a business or the assignment is for the benefit of creditors generally.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

'''Georges Marquet''' (18 September 1886, [[Jemeppe-sur-Meuse]] - 27 March 1947, [[Nice]]) was a Belgian hotel manager and owner of many luxurious hotels in [[Europe]]. He created the ''Compagnie Internationale des Grands Hôtels Européens'', which later would be part of the [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits|Compagnie Internationale des wagons-lits]] group, created by his compatriote and inventor (among other things) of the [[Orient-Express]], the [[Belgian]] [[Georges Nagelmackers]].

After he had bought the most luxurious hotels of [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], namely, the [[Hôtel Ritz (Madrid)|Ritz Madrid]] and the [[The Westin Palace Madrid|Palace Hotel (''today called Westin Palace'')]], his son lived in [[Madrid]] and was in charge of the [[Hôtel Ritz (Madrid)|Ritz Madrid]] direction.

'''Gold Spike''' (formerly '''Gold Spike Hotel &amp; Casino''') is a bar, lounge, residential building, and former [[boutique hotel|boutique]] 112-room,&lt;ref name="lasvegassun1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hansel |first=Mark |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/feb/13/transformation-downtowns-gold-spike/ |title=The transformation of downtown’s Gold Spike - Las Vegas Sun News |publisher=Lasvegassun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; seven floor hotel. It is connected with the '''Oasis at the Gold Spike''', a 50-room three floor hotel located in [[downtown Las Vegas]]. It was owned by entrepreneur [[Tony Hsieh]] and his Downtown Project, having bought it from [[The Siegel Group]]; and the casino was operated by [[Golden Gaming]].

Hsieh closed the casino on April 14, 2013.&lt;ref name=spillman /&gt; After a three-week remodel, Gold Spike re-opened the casino as a restaurant and bar on May 6, 2013. The hotel portion of the building was recently converted into permanent and temporary workforce housing for Downtown Project, entrepreneurs, and Zappos; Oasis hotel is a separate building on the same property.&lt;ref&gt;http://recode.net/2014/09/30/the-gold-spike-welcome-to-your-entrepreneur-dorm/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jerry Fink |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/may/03/joe-downtown-casino-less-gold-spike-opens-monday-o/ |title=Joe Downtown: Casino-less Gold Spike opens Monday; old pizza place to get new life - Las Vegas Sun News |publisher=Lasvegassun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Rendezvous (1976-85)===
It originally opened in 1976 as the 112-room ''Rendezvous''. In 1983 [[Jackie Gaughan]] purchased the property after it had been closed for several months.

===Gold Spike Hotel &amp; Casino (1985-2013)===
The Gold Spike for years has been known as an inexpensive hotel with few amenities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/la-082601nevada,0,389393.story | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Four for the money | first=John | last=Deiner | date=August 26, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 2002, Gaughan agreed to sell the Gold Spike and three other casinos to [[Barrick Gaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| date        = December 6, 2002
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sale, along with several other downtown Las Vegas hotel/casinos, was completed in 2004, for a combined total of about $82 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E3DF1F3CF932A25752C1A9629C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Company News; Barrick Gaming Paying $31 Million For Nevada Casino | date=November 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Barrick Gaming Corp was in partnership with [[Tamares Group]]. After the purchase, management discontinued the table games and only offered slot machines. In a few years the property was offered for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gold Spike bar demolishing.jpg|thumb|Remodeling of the bar after its purchase by Hsieh]]
On July 23, 2007, Greg Covin bought the property for $15.6 million with the intention of turning it into a boutique hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| date        = July 12, 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He sold it on February 4, 2008 for $21 million to [[The Siegel Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| date        = February 4, 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Siegel Group set out to completely renovate the property&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lvrj.com/business/new-owners-bring-money--optimism-to-downtown-89864307.html |title=New owners bring money, optimism to downtown &amp;#124; Las Vegas Review-Journal |publisher=Lvrj.com |date=2010-04-04 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and combine it with an old and forgotten 52-room motel located next to the property.  As one author wrote, the Gold Spike now has "Quartz walls, tile floors, wood accents, and new everything", making it "a very modern boutique hotel in the heart of downtown".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/brandpublishing/travelplus/lasvegasguide/la-ss-vegas-quirky-70sinspired-hotel-brings-choice-vibes-to-downtown-20150227dto-story.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first floor, containing the gaming floor, the bar, and the restaurant, was completely renovated by February 2009.&lt;ref name="lasvegassun1"/&gt;

By April 2010, all guest floors and the exterior of the hotel has been completely remodeled and renovated.  In May 2010, the Oasis Pool opened, giving Gold Spike a swimming pool.

In April 2013, it was reported that the property's debt had been acquired by [[Tony Hsieh]]'s Downtown Project, a campaign to revitalize downtown Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joe Downtown: Want a room at the Gold Spike?

===Casino closure ===
Siegel then announced that it had sold the Gold Spike to the Downtown Project, and that the casino would close on April 14.&lt;ref name=spillman&gt;{{cite news|title=Downtown Project buys Gold Spike, casino to close on Sunday|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=April 11, 2013|author=Benjamin Spillman|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/downtown-project-buys-gold-spike-casino-close-sunday|accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siegel retained rights to the Gold Spike name,&lt;ref name=schoenmann&gt;{{cite news|title=Joe Downtown: Downtown Project adds Gold Spike to its property holdings; casino to close Sunday|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|author=Joe Schoenmann|date=April 11, 2013|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/apr/11/downtown-project-adds-gold-spike-its-property-port/|accessdate=2013-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said that the company needed to dispose of smaller properties on its way to owning larger casinos on the Strip.&lt;ref name=spillman /&gt; Hsieh was reported to be considering several ideas for the property, including a boutique hotel, specialty retail space, or a club, but ruled out a casino, saying that he was "trying to help build a community".&lt;ref name=schoenmann /&gt; In 2014, Gold Spike reopened the former casino area as a bar and lounge with social games. Gold Spike renovated its top floor into a penthouse suite for the thirty-first season of the [[MTV]] television series ''[[Real World (TV series)|Real World]]'', ''[[Real World: Go Big or Go Home]]''. This suite can now be rented by the public and it is in the Gold Spike property and not The Oasis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/tv/the-real-world-officially-returned-las-vegas-today&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oasis at The Gold Spike==
The adjacent 3-story motel was originally built in 1962 as a 57-room [[Travel Inn]] Motel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotelbusiness.com/hb/links/news/news.asp?ID=38126 |title=Siegel Group Establishes Las Vegas ‘Boutique Chic Retreats’ Portfolio |publisher=hotelbusiness.com |date=2010-04-14 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The property was abandoned, becoming a [[blight]] between the [[Fremont Street Experience]] and [[Las Vegas City Hall]].  The Siegel Group purchased this property in August 2007 for $5 million&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and started making plans to renovate it and reopen the property.  Plans were put on hold when they purchased the neighboring Gold Spike.  Finally, by April 2010, the rooms had been completely renovated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qremodeling.com/contractors/Nevada/remodeling-in-Las_Vegas.html|title=The Las Vegas Remodeling Project|publisher=Q Remodeling Construction Group|date=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and renamed "The Oasis at The Gold Spike"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2010/apr/13/rumor-has-it/ |title=Rumor has it |publisher=Las Vegas Weekly |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and connected to the Gold Spike via an outdoor lounge and walkway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siegelcompanies.com/newsroom/siegel-group-brings-boutique-chic-retreats-las-vegas/  http://siegelcompanies.com/newsroom/siegel-group-brings-boutique-chic-retreats-las-vegas/]&lt;/ref&gt;  After a reconfiguration of the property, it was left with 50-rooms, which have been modernized and turned into bungalow suites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotelinteractive.com/article.aspx?articleid=16720 |title=The Siegel Group To Open Rumor Hotel In June |publisher=Hotelinteractive.com |date=2010-04-14 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oasis at the Gold Spike had the distinction of being the only [[Downtown Las Vegas|downtown]] hotel with a [[Las Vegas Boulevard|Las Vegas Blvd.]] address.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lasvegas.informermg.com/2013/04/13/growing-pains-gold-spike-hotel-and-casino-to-close-on-sunday-making-room-for-redevelopment/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2010, the City of Las Vegas changed the entire Gold Spike property to this address.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4850">{{Contract law}}
In [[contract law]], an '''illusory promise''' is one that courts will not enforce.  This is in contrast with a [[contract]], which is a promise that courts will enforce.  A promise may be illusory for a number of reasons.  In [[common law]] countries this usually results from failure or lack of [[consideration]] (see also [[consideration under English law]]).

Illusory promises are so named because they merely hold the illusion of contract.  For example, a promise of the form, "I will give you ten dollars if I feel like it," is purely illusory and will not be enforced as a contract.

It is a general principle of contract law that courts should err on the side of enforcing contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby J in ''Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace'' (1988) 15 NSWLR 130&lt;/ref&gt;  Parties entering into the arrangement presumably had the intention of forming an enforceable contract, and so courts generally attempt to follow this intention.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Portland Gasoline Co. v. Superior Marketing Co., 150 Tex. 533, 243 S.W.2d 823, 824, (1951''), overruled on other grounds by ''Northern Natural Gas Co. v. Conoco, Inc., 986 S.W.2d. 603 (Tex. 1998)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A promise conditioned upon an event within the promisor's control is not illusory if the promisor also "impliedly promises to make reasonable effort to bring the event about or to use good faith and honest judgment in determining whether or not it has in fact occurred."&lt;ref&gt;1 Corbin on Contracts, s 149, at 659.&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods of finding potentially illusory contracts enforceable include:
* Implied-in-law "good faith" terms
* Implied-in-fact terms
* Bargaining for a chance

==Implied-in-law "good faith" terms==
Many contracts include "satisfaction clauses", in which a promisor can refuse to pay if he isn't subjectively satisfied with the promisee's performance.  Strictly speaking, this is an illusory promise, since the promisor has no actual legal burden to pay if he chooses not to.  However, courts will generally imply in law that the promisor must act in good faith and reject the deal only if he is genuinely dissatisfied.  As another example, if a contract promises a promisee a certain percentage of the proceeds of a promisor's business activities, this is illusory, since the promisor doesn't have to do anything: any percentage of zero is zero.  However, courts may find that the promisor made an implied promise to use reasonable efforts to try to make money, and cite him for breach of contract if he does absolutely nothing.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon]]'', 222 N.Y. 88, 118 N.E. 214 (1917).&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.C.C. in contracts exclusive to both sides requires "best efforts" in such contracts.  This may be read to be the same as a good faith effort, but is seen by some courts as a higher duty.

==Implied-in-fact terms==
Judges will often infer terms into the contract that the parties did not explicitly cite.  For instance, in the "satisfaction clause" case, judges might infer that the parties intended a "reasonableness test" - that the clause could be satisfied if a reasonable person would be satisfied by the promisee's performance, regardless of whether the promisor himself asserts he is satisfied.  (This interpretation is often used in cases in which a performance can be objectively evaluated, such as with the construction of a warehouse; the implied-in-law interpretation above is preferred where satisfaction is more subjective, as with the painting of a portrait.)

==Bargaining for a chance==
Many judges{{who|date=February 2011}} would consider the "bargaining for a percentage of the proceeds" example above an enforceable contract, even without an implied-in-fact or implied-in-law good faith term.  They would view the opportunity to enter into a business relationship to itself be acceptable consideration.  Put differently, the mere possibility that the promisor would do business is a valuable product of the bargain even if he does not do anything.  Of course, if the promisor entered into the relationship purely with the intent of fraudulently harming the promisee, he could be cited for fraud or bad faith principles that apply to all contracts.

==Changes to a "contract" without notification==
Some websites' "terms and conditions" may be deemed an illusory contract and unenforceable if the language can be changed at any time by the company without notifying users and giving them a chance to accept the new changes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harris v. Blockbuster Inc.]], No. 09-cv-217 (N.D. Tex. April 15, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Eric.

'''José Antonio Ferré Aguayo''' (September 12, 1902 &amp;ndash; September 15, 1990) was a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] businessman, industrialist and government official. He was a brother of [[Luis A. Ferré|Luis Ferré]], who served as [[Governor of Puerto Rico]], and [[Isolina Ferré]], the "[[Mother Teresa]] of Puerto Rico". Ferré was also the father of [[Maurice Ferré]], a former six-term mayor of [[Miami, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Hispanics in American Politics: The Search for Political Power | first=Maurilio E. | last=Vigil | year=1987 | page=102 | chapter=Hispanics in Local Office- State and Local Levels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Ferré was born in Ponce and the son of Cuban born Antonio Ferré Bacallao.&lt;ref name="Sarasota"/&gt; After attending [[Morristown-Beard School#History|Morristown-School]] (now Morristown-Beard School) in [[Morristown, New Jersey]], he earned his bachelor's degree in business administration at [[Boston University]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1924.&lt;ref name="congressional record"&gt;{{USCongRec|1990|E3220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferré later served on the Board of Trustees of the school alongside [[Edward Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | title=Boston U Names a Kennedy | date=21 October 1961}} "Edward M. Kennedy, youngest brother of President Kennedy, was one of three persons elected today to the Board of Trustees of Boston University. Other elected were Stephen P. Mugar of Belmont, President of the Star Market Company, and Jose A. Ferre, industrialist."&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his master's degree in business administration from the [[University of Miami]].&lt;ref name="congressional record"/&gt;

==Industrial development==

During the years following [[World War II]], Ferré grew his wealth by purchasing bankrupt glass, cement, and carton factories. At one point, his family empire owned 80 corporations in Puerto Rico, the United States, Venezuela, and Panama.&lt;ref name="Sarasota"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune | title=Jose Antonio Ferre Aguayo | date=19 September 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Ferré's real estate company, the Ferré Florida Corporation, financed the construction of the 30-story [[New World Tower]] in the [[Downtown Miami#Central business district ("Downtown")|Central Business District]] in Miami. At the time, the building, which cost $6 million to construct, stood as the tallest in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | title=30-Story Miami Building Will Be Tallest in Florida | date=27 November 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its construction represented part of a broader effort to revitalize Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | title=MIAMI REVERSES TREND OF DOWNTOWN DECAY; Enormous Project | date=November 3, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

In 1990, U.S. Representative [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] from [[Florida's 27th congressional district]]  honored the legacy and impact of Ferré during remarks on the floor of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. The tribute recognized Ferré's vision and industrial pursuits.&lt;ref name="congressional record"/&gt;

A '''limited liability company''' ('''LLC''') is the [[United States of America|US]]-specific form of a [[private limited company]]. It is a [[business]] structure that can combine the [[Flow-through entity|pass-through taxation]] of a [[partnership]] or [[sole proprietorship]] with the [[limited liability]] of a [[corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwindt|first1=Kari|title=Limited Liability Companies: Issues in Member Liability|journal=UCLE Law Review|date=1996|volume=44|page=1541|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/uclalr44&amp;div=43|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Limited liability company (LLC)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/limited_liability_company_llc|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An LLC is not a corporation in and of itself; it is a legal form of a [[company]] that provides limited liability to its owners in many jurisdictions. LLCs are well-known for the flexibility that they provide to business owners; depending on the situation, an LLC may elect to use corporate tax rules instead of being treated as a partnership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc | title=Limited Liability Company (LLC) | publisher=Internal Revenue Service| access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, under certain circumstances, LLCs may be organized as not-for-profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Richard A. |last1=McCray |first2=Ward L. |last2=Thomas |title=Limited Liability Companies as Exempt Organizations |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopich00.pdf | publisher=Internal Revenue Service | access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain U.S. states (for example, Texas), businesses that provide professional services requiring a state professional license, such as legal or [[medical services]], may not be allowed to form an LLC but may be required to form a similar entity called a '''professional limited liability company''' ('''PLLC''').&lt;ref name="accountingtoday"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akalp|first1=Neil|title=Should You Structure Your Accounting Firm as an LLC, PLLC or PC?|url=https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/should-you-structure-your-accounting-firm-as-an-llc-pllc-or-pc|website=Accounting Today | publisher=SourceMedia | date=10 August 2016 | access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A limited liability company (LLC) is a hybrid [[legal person|legal entity]] having certain characteristics of both a [[corporation]] and a [[partnership]] or [[sole proprietorship]] (depending on how many owners there are). An LLC is a type of [[voluntary association|unincorporated association]] distinct from a corporation. The primary characteristic an LLC shares with a corporation is [[limited liability]], and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of [[flow-through entity|pass-through]] [[taxation in the United States|income taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is a Limited Liability Company (LLC)|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/limited_liability_company.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often more flexible than a corporation, and it is well-suited for companies with a single owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bischoff|first1=Bill|title=The advantages of owning real estate in a single-member LLC|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-advantages-of-owning-real-estate-in-a-single-member-llc-2017-05-01|website=MarketWatch, Inc.|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although LLCs and corporations both possess some analogous features, the basic terminology commonly associated with each type of legal entity, at least within the United States, is sometimes different. When an LLC is formed, it is said to be "organized,” not "incorporated" or "chartered,” and its founding document is likewise known as its "[[articles of organization]]," instead of its "[[articles of incorporation]]" or its "corporate charter.” Internal operations of an LLC are further governed by its "[[operating agreement]]," rather than its "[[by-law|bylaws]]." The owner of beneficial rights in an LLC is known as a "member," rather than a "[[shareholder]].” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=Kevin|title=What Is the Difference Between a Shareholder Vs. a LLC Member?|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/difference-between-shareholder-vs-llc-member-61708.html|accessdate=7 September 2017|agency=Houston Chronicle|publisher=[[Hearst Newspapers, LLC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[ownership]] in an LLC is represented by a "membership interest" or an "LLC interest" (sometimes measured in "membership units" or just "units" and at other times simply stated only as [[percentage]]s), rather than represented by "[[share (finance)|shares of stock]]" or just "shares" (with ownership measured by the number of shares held by each shareholder). Similarly, when issued in physical rather than electronic form, a document evidencing ownership rights in an LLC is called a "membership certificate" rather than a "[[stock certificate]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Scott E.|title=Forming Your Own Limilted Liability Company|date=1996|publisher=Dearborn Trade Publishing|isbn=9780936894935|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAP5gXGGFFEC|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of express statutory guidance, most American courts have held that LLC members are subject to the same common law alter ego [[Piercing the corporate veil|piercing theories]] as corporate shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macey|first1=Jonathan R.|title=The Three Justifications for Piercing the Corporate Veil|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/03/27/the-three-justifications-for-piercing-the-corporate-veil/|website=The Three Justifications for Piercing the Corporate Veil|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is more difficult to pierce the LLC veil because LLCs do not have many formalities to maintain. As long as the LLC and the members do not [[commingling|commingle]] funds, it is difficult to pierce the LLC veil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Shaun M.|title=Piercing the Veil of the Limited Liability Company, from Sure Bet to Long Shot: Gallinger v. North Star Hospital Mutual Assurance, Ltd.|journal=Journal of Corporate Law|date=1996|volume=22|page=131|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/jcorl22&amp;div=14|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vandervoort|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Piercing the Veil of Limited Liability Companies: The Need for a Better Standard|journal=DePaul Business and Commercial Law Journal|date=2004|volume=3|page=51|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/depbcl3&amp;div=10|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership interests in LLCs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the [[charging order]] mechanism. The charging order limits the creditor of a debtor-partner or a debtor-member to the debtor's share of distributions, without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adkisson|first1=Jay|title=The Misunderstood Charging Order|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayadkisson/2013/04/30/the-misunderstood-charging-order/|website=Forbes|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limited liability company members may, in certain circumstances, also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the LLC insolvent.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Delaware Code, Title 6, Chapter 18, Limited Liability Company Act|url=http://delcode.delaware.gov/title6/c018/sc06/index.shtml|website=State of Delaware|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first state to enact a law authorizing limited liability companies was [[Wyoming]] in 1977. The form did not become immediately popular, in part because of uncertainties in tax treatment by the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. After an IRS ruling in 1988 that Wyoming LLCs could be taxed as partnerships, other states began enacting LLC statutes. By 1996, all 50 states had LLC statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/law_trends_news_practice_area_e_newsletter_home/llc.html|title=LLCs: Is the Future Here? A History and Prognosis|last=|first=|date=October 2004|website=www.americanbar.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flexibility and default rules==
LLCs are subject to fewer regulations than traditional corporations, and thus may allow members to create a more flexible management structure than is possible with other corporate forms. As long as it remains within the confines of state law, the operating agreement is responsible for the flexibility the members of the LLC have in deciding how their LLC will be governed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pros and Cons of a Limited Liability Company (LLC)|url=https://www.allbusiness.com/pros-and-cons-of-a-limited-liability-company-llc-2517-1.html|website=AllBusiness.com|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; State statutes typically provide automatic or "default" rules for how an LLC will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise.

The limited liability company ("LLC") has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the United States. Even the use of a single member LLC affords greater protection for the assets of the member, as compared to operating as an unincorporated entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Shari P.|title=Single Member LLC Vs. Sole Proprietorship Liability|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/single-member-llc-vs-sole-proprietorship-liability-81147.html|website=Houston Chronicle|publisher=[[Hearst Newspapers, LLC]]|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective August 1, 2013, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members. Under the amendment (prompted by the Delaware Supreme Court's decision in ''Gatz Properties, LLC v. Auriga Capital Corp''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gatz Properties, LLC v. Auriga Capital Corp., 59 A. 3d 1206 (2012)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13162396720159555258|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; parties to an LLC remain free to expand, restrict, or eliminate fiduciary duties in their LLC agreements (subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Falby|first1=Bruce E.|title=Delaware amends its LLC Act: managers and controllers owe fiduciary duties unless LLC agreement provides otherwise|url=https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2013/08/delaware-amends-its-llc-act--managers-and-contro__/|website=DLA Piper|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under 6 Del. C. Section 18-101(7), a Delaware LLC operating agreement can be written, oral or implied. It sets forth member capital contributions, ownership percentages, and management structure. Like a prenuptial agreement, an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buy-out rights, valuation formulas, and transfer restrictions. The written LLC operating agreement should be signed by all of its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bainbridge|first1=Stephen|title=Didn't sign your LLC operating agreement? Think that'll get you off? Think again.|url=http://www.professorbainbridge.com/professorbainbridgecom/2014/09/didnt-sign-your-llc-operating-agreement-think-thatll-get-you-off-think-again.html|website=ProfessorBainbridge.com|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Income tax==
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an LLC is treated by default as a pass-through entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iss4.pdf |title=Instruction SS-4 (Rev. January 2011) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is only one member in the company, the LLC is treated as a "disregarded entity" for tax purposes (unless another tax status is elected), and an individual owner would report the LLC's income or loss on [[Form 1040#1040|Schedule C]] of his or her individual tax return. Thus, income from the LLC is taxed at the individual tax rates. The default tax status for LLCs with multiple members is as a partnership, which is required to report income and loss on [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] Form 1065. Under partnership tax treatment, each member of the LLC, as is the case for all partners of a partnership, annually receives a Form K-1 reporting the member's distributive share of the LLC's income or loss that is then reported on the member's individual income tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LLC Filing as a Corporation or Partnership|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/llc-filing-as-a-corporation-or-partnership|website=IRS|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, income from corporations is taxed twice: once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders.  Thus, more tax savings often result if a business formed as an LLC rather than a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akalp|first1=Nellie|title=How to Structure Your Startup to Avoid Double Taxation|url=http://mashable.com/2012/02/09/business-incorporation-taxes/|website=Mashable|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An LLC with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of IRS Form 8832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8832.pdf |title=IRS Form 8832 (Rev. January 2011) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After electing corporate tax status, an LLC may further elect to be treated as a regular [[C corporation]] (taxation of the entity's income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the [[dividend]]s or distributions once received as income by the members) or as an [[S corporation]] (entity level income and loss passes through to the members). Some commentators have recommended an LLC taxed as a S-corporation as the best possible [[small business]] structure. It combines the simplicity and flexibility of an LLC with the tax benefits of an S-corporation (self-employment tax savings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/Small-Business-Taxes/Limited-Liability-Company-Taxes/INF12029.html |title=Tax Advantages of Corporations - Updated for Tax Year 2016 |publisher=TurboTax |accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
* Choice of [[entity classification election|tax regime]]. An LLC can elect to be taxed as a [[sole proprietor]], partnership, S corporation or C corporation (as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment), providing for a great deal of flexibility.
* A limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members' distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title26-vol8/pdf/CFR-2010-title26-vol8-sec1-704-1.pdf Treasury Regulation (26 CFR) 1.704-1] are met. S corporations may not specially allocate profits, losses and other tax items under US tax law.
* The owners of the LLC, called members, are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the LLC, depending on state shield laws.
* In the United States, an S corporation has a limited number of stockholders, and all of them must be U.S. tax residents; an LLC may have an unlimited number of members, and there is no citizenship restriction.
* Much less administrative paperwork and record-keeping than a corporation.
* [[Flow-through entity|Pass-through taxation]] (i.e., no [[double taxation]]), unless the LLC elects to be taxed as a C corporation.
* Using default tax classification, [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] are taxed personally at the member level, not at the LLC level.
* LLCs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members. However, in some jurisdictions such as Connecticut, case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and LLC members can be personally liable for operation of the LLC) (see, for example, the case of ''Sturm v. Harb Development''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sturm v. Harb Development, 298 Conn. 124, 2 A.3d 859 (2010)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4103942001146152039|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* LLCs in some states can be set up with just one [[natural person]] involved.
* Less risk of being "stolen" by fire-sale acquisitions (more protection against "hungry" [[investor]]s).
* For real estate companies, each separate property can be owned by its own individual LLC, thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from cross-liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Six Benefits of Limited Liability Companies|url=https://cornerstonelaw.us/6-benefits-limited-liability-companies/|website=Cornerstone Law Firm|publisher=Cornerstone Law Firm, LLC|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Although there is no statutory requirement for an [[operating agreement]] in most jurisdictions, members of a multiple member LLC who operate without one may encounter problems. Unlike state laws regarding stock corporations, which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders, most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company. Thus, in the absence of such statutory provisions, the members of an LLC must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document.
* It may be more difficult to raise [[financial capital]] for an LLC as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the better-understood corporate form with a view toward an eventual [[initial public offering|IPO]]. One possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it, dissolving the LLC and converting into a corporation.
* Many jurisdictions—including [[Alabama]], [[California]], [[Kentucky]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Texas]]—levy a [[franchise tax]] or capital values tax on LLCs. In essence, this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the LLC pays the state for the benefit of limited liability. The franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue, an amount based on profits, or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state, or some combination of those factors, or simply a flat fee, as in Delaware.
** Effective in Texas for 2007 the franchise tax is replaced with the Texas Business Margin Tax. This is paid as: tax payable = revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor. In most states, however, the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations.
** In California, both foreign and domestic LLCs, corporations, and trusts, whether for-profit or non-profit—unless the entity is tax exempt—must at least pay a minimum income tax of $800 per year to the Franchise Tax Board; and no foreign LLC, corporation or trust may conduct business in California unless it is duly registered with the California Secretary of State.
* Renewal fees may also be higher. Maryland, for example, charges a stock or nonstock corporation $120 for the initial charter, and $100 for an LLC. The fee for filing the annual report the following year is $300 for stock-corporations and LLCs. The fee is zero for non-stock corporations. In addition, certain states, such as New York, impose a publication requirement upon formation of the LLC which requires that the members of the LLC publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the LLC will be located that it is being formed. For LLCs located in major metropolitan areas (e.g., New York City), the cost of publication can be significant.
* The management structure of an LLC may not be clearly stated. Unlike corporations, they are not required to have a board of directors or officers. (This could also be seen as an advantage to some.)
* Taxing jurisdictions outside the US are likely to treat a US LLC as a corporation, regardless of its treatment for US tax purposes—for example a US LLC doing business outside the US or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[HMRC]] in the [[United Kingdom]], see [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/dtmanual/DT19853A.htm HMRC Tax Manuals, DT19853A]&lt;/ref&gt; This is very likely where the country (such as Canada) does not recognize LLCs as an authorized form of business entity in that country.
* The principals of LLCs use many different titles—e.g., member, manager, managing member, managing director, chief executive officer, president, and partner. As such, it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the LLC's behalf.

==Variations==
* A Professional Limited Liability Company (PLLC, P.L.L.C., or P.L.) is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of providing professional services. Usually, professions where the state requires a license to provide services, such as a [[Physician|doctor]], [[chiropractor]], [[lawyer]], [[accountant]], [[architect]], [[landscape architect]], or [[engineer]], require the formation of a PLLC.&lt;ref name="accountingtoday"/&gt; However, some states, such as California, do not permit LLCs to engage in the practice of a licensed profession. Exact requirements of PLLCs vary from state to state. Typically, a PLLC's members must all be professionals practicing the same profession. In addition, the limitation of personal liability of members does not extend to professional malpractice claims.
* A [[Series LLC]] is a special form of a Limited liability company that allows a single LLC to segregate its assets into separate series. For example, a series LLC that purchases separate pieces of real estate may put each in a separate series so if the lender forecloses on one piece of property, the others are not affected.
* An [[L3C]] is a for-profit, social enterprise venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose, not maximizing income. It is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional LLC, the social benefits of a nonprofit organization, and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise.
* An Anonymous Limited Liability Company is a LLC for which ownership information is not made publicly available by the state. This is typically accomplished by using a third-party to act as the organizer and [[registered agent]] of the LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donahue|first1=Larry|title=Just How "Anonymous" are Anonymous LLC's?|url=https://www.l4sb.com/blog/just-anonymous-anonymous-llcs/|website=Law 4 Small Business, P.C.|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]], various [[Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2016#Economists|economists]] and [[List_of_Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign_primary_endorsements,_2016#Businesspeople|businesspeople]] have served both in a formal and an informal capacity, to advise Trump on [[macroeconomics]] and associated [[government policy]] decisions.  During the [[presidential transition of Donald Trump#Transition_team|transition]] to the [[Presidency of Donald Trump#Personnel|presidency]], Trump gained additional advisors, and after the [[inauguration of Donald Trump#Committee_members|inauguration]] some of his advisors will officially become part of the [[Political appointments of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] (including the [[United States National Economic Council|NEC]], [[National Trade Council|NTC]], [[Senior_Advisor_to_the_President_of_the_United_States#Donald_Trump|advisors]], [[List_of_U.S._executive_branch_czars#List_of_executive_branch_czars|czars]], [[Counselor to the President|counselors]], [[Cabinet of Donald Trump#Director of the Office of Management and Budget|OMB]], [[Cabinet of Donald Trump#Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers|CEA]], [[Cabinet of Donald Trump#Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury]], [[Cabinet of Donald Trump#Secretary of Commerce|Commerce]], [[Cabinet of Donald Trump#United States Trade Representative|USTR]], [[Cabinet of Donald Trump#Administrator of the Small Business Administration|SBA]], [[Political appointments of Donald Trump#Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]], and the [[Political appointments of Donald Trump#Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve|Fed]]) while others will remain in the [[private sector]] as informal advisors with varying degrees of influence.

==During his presidential campaign==
{{main|Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016}}
Trump released initial details of his economic policies when his campaign officially began in June 2015, and more details during the first [[Republican Party presidential debates and forums, 2016|Republican debates]] which began in August 2015.  Although critical of certain aspects of Trump's early economic plans, especially increasing [[tariff]]s as opposed to [[free trade]] policies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/08/26/donald_trump_a_21st_century_protectionist_herbert_hoover_127893.html|title=Donald Trump: A 21st Century Protectionist Herbert Hoover - RealClearPolitics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Kudlow]] and [[Stephen Moore (writer)|Steve Moore]] would eventually{{when|date=December 2016}} agree to join the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump campaign]] as advisors.  Although most presidential candidates had announced a team of formal economic advisors by October 2015, at the time Trump still primarily relied upon [[Donald Trump#Business career|his business background]] to inform his economic plan ([[Carly Fiorina]] was the other candidate who relied primarily upon her own background in business in the early phases of the campaign).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/257277-the-economic-advisers-behind-the-candidates|title=The economic advisers behind the candidates|first=Mark Bloomfield,|last=contributor|date=19 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to his own business expertise, Trump had a network of contacts that sometimes served as informal economic advisors during his campaign, including [[Carl Icahn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/11/21/donald-trump-carl-ichan-role/|title=Billionaire Carl Icahn Is Considering an Official Economics Role under Donald Trump|first=Lucinda|last=Shen|website=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even as late as July 2016, however, [[Larry Kudlow|Kudlow]] and [[Stephen Moore (writer)|Moore]] were still not official advisors, despite having already helped craft some of Trump's policy-positions related to taxation for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/21/what-trumps-and-clintons-economic-advisors-can-tell-you-about-the-candidates.html|title=What Trump's and Clinton's economic advisors can tell you about the candidates|first=Ivan|last=Levingston|date=22 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As the [[President-elect]]==
{{main|Cabinet of Donald Trump|Political appointments of Donald Trump}}

As of December 2016, many of the advisors during the campaign listed above are under consideration for [[Cabinet of Donald Trump|cabinet-level roles]] or other [[Political appointments of Donald Trump|high-level roles]] in the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]].  (For instance, Navarro is a contender for the [[Council_of_Economic_Advisers#List_of_Chairs|CEA]] chair, and Shelton is a contender for [[Political_appointments_of_Donald_Trump#Vice_Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve|Fed Vice-Chair]].)  

===Informal presidential advisors===

Of the above, Stephen Bannon resigned on 18 August 2017; Reince Prebus was fired on 11 March 2017.

In addition to the tech-industry group, there is also a more general business advisory group being formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/12/05/donald-trump-business-advisors-barra-rometty/|title=Mary Barra and Ginni Rometty Are On Trump's New Panel of CEO Advisors|first=Claire|last=Zillman|website=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Billionaire [[Stephen Schwarzman]] of [[Blackstone Group|Blackstone]] organized the business advisory group, which also includes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/tech/news/2016/12/14/ceos-tesla-uber-join-trumps-business-adviser-team/95416356/|title=Elon Musk, Uber's Kalanick join Trump's business adviser team|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear whether Trump or his transition team have personally met with this advisory group, but media reports indicate that some of the members were considered for [[Cabinet of Donald Trump|cabinet-level]] positions in his administration (including Dimon as a potential treasury secretary, Cosgrove as potential secretary of veterans affairs, Warsh for a potential Federal Reserve role).

'''Lithium Technologies''' is a San Francisco-based provider of software that allows businesses to connect with their customers on [[social media]] and digital channels. Lithium was founded in 2001 as a spin-out from GX Media, which created technologies for professional rankings and tournaments and now hosts a number of popular gaming sites. The company's founders include [[Dennis Fong]], Lyle Fong, Michel Thouati, Kirk Yokomizo, John Joh, Nader Alizadeh, Michael Yang, and Matt Ayres.

The Lithium platform comprises a set of products for [[digital marketing]] and social customer support, including Lithium Communities, which act as the hub for a brand's digital conversations; Lithium Response, a social customer care tool; and Lithium Reach a social media management tool. [[Klout]] data powers the Lithium platform with its proprietary algorithms and volume of data with over 750M scored profiles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Lithium's [[Software as a service|SaaS]] platform combines [[Online community|online customer community]] applications such as [[Internet forum|forums]], [[blogs]], [[innovation]] management, product [[Customer review|reviews]], and [[tribal knowledge]] bases with the broader social web and traditional [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] business processes, resulting in a wide range of online customer interaction methods.&lt;ref name=Greenberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=McKay/&gt; Stemming from its [[Gamification|gaming]] roots, the platform incorporates elaborate rating systems for contributors, with ranks, badges, and "kudos counts".&lt;ref name="O'Malley"/&gt;

Lithium hosts an annual user conference, LiNC (Lithium Networking Conference&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/linc-2015-lithium-sticks-the-landing/|title=LiNC 2015: Lithium sticks the landing {{!}} ZDNet|last=Greenberg|first=Paul|website=ZDNet|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) designed to give [[Digital strategy|digital strategists]] a deeper understanding of trends in social customer engagement. Since its inception in 2008, the event has grown 1,100% to 900+ attendees in 2016. In 2017, the company held a series of localized LiNC events in cities like London, San Francisco, and Sydney.

==History==

In late 2008, Lithium completed a detailed, time-series analysis of up to a decade's worth of proprietary data that represents billions of interactions, millions of users, and scores of communities. This research, coupled with the company's expertise in planning, deploying, and managing customer communities, enabled Lithium to identify and calculate key factors that contributed to a new standard for measuring community health – the [[Community Health Index]].&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12338">The '''Lloyd–La Follette Act''' of 1912 began the process of protecting [[civil servants]] in the [[United States]] from unwarranted or abusive removal by codifying "just cause" standards previously embodied in presidential orders.  It defines "just causes" as those that would promote the "efficiency of the service."  August 24, 1912, § 6, {{USStat|37|555}}, {{USC|5|7511}}

The Act further states that "the right of employees... to furnish information to either House of Congress, or to a committee or Member thereof, may not be interfered with or denied." {{USC|5|7211}}

== Legislative history ==

Under the leadership of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.napfe.com/mg0701wc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050129201112/http://www.napfe.com/mg0701wc.htm |archivedate=2005-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Congress]] enacted the Act with the intention of conferring job protection rights on federal employees which they had not previously had.  Prior to the enactment of this language, there was no such statutory inhibition on the authority of the government to discharge a federal employee, and an employee could be discharged with or without cause for conduct which was not protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

The act was passed after the [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (in 1902) and [[William Howard Taft|Taft]] (in 1909) administrations prohibited federal employees from communicating with Congress without authorization from their superiors. This language was later placed in the [[Civil Service Reform Act of 1978]] and codified in {{USC|5|7211}}. The purpose of this Act was to allow Congress to obtain uncensored, essential information from federal employees. Congress intended to allow the federal workers direct access to Congress in order to register complaints about conduct by their supervisors and to report corruption or incompetence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/T?&amp;report=sr167&amp;dbname=106&amp; DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURT EMPLOYEES ACT OF 1999, Report of the COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS UNITED STATES SENATE, to accompany H.R. 858, TO AMEND CHAPTER 17 OF TITLE 11, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CODE, TO PROVIDE FOR PERSONNEL PROTECTION FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURT EMPLOYEES]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Arnett v. Kennedy]]'', 416 U.S. 134 (1974),&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=416&amp;invol=134 FindLaw for Legal Professionals - Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the United States Supreme Court addressed questions about the Act.  It held that the Act's standard of employment protection, which describes as explicitly as is feasible in view of the wide variety of factual situations where employees' statements might justify dismissal for "cause" the conduct that is ground for removal, is not impermissibly vague or overbroad in regulating federal employees' speech.

One of the primary purposes of the Act was to protect those who criticize of superiors from official retribution. Senator La Follette gave the following example of an abuse sought to be cured by the bill

&lt;blockquote&gt;The cause for [the employee's] dismissal was that he gave publicity to the insanitary conditions existing in some part of the post-office building in Chicago where the clerks were required to perform their services.... [H]e furnished some facts to the press of Chicago, and the publication was made of the conditions. They were simply horrible.... The public health officers of Chicago, as soon as their attention was called to the conditions, condemned the situation as they found it; and yet this young man, one of the brightest fellows I have met, was removed from the service because, he had given publicity to these outrageous conditions. {{USCongRec|48|10731}} (1912).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Act was thus the first federal law enacted specifically to protect [[whistleblower]]s.

The history and scope of the Act was further described by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Bush v. Lucas]]'', 462 U.S. 367, 103 S.Ct. 2404 (1983).&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=462&amp;invol=367 findlaw.com], quoting directly from the decision&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Congressional attention to the problem of {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated removals was again prompted by the issuance of Executive Orders by Presidents Roosevelt and Taft that forbade federal employees to communicate directly with Congress without the permission of their supervisors....  These "gag orders," enforced by dismissal, were cited by several legislators as the reason for enacting the Lloyd–La Follette Act in 1912, {{USStat|37|555}}, § 6.FN20 That statute... explicitly guaranteed that the right of civil servants "to furnish information to either House of Congress, or to any committee or member thereof, shall not be denied or interfered with." FN22 As the House Report explained, this legislation was intended "to protect employees against oppression and in the right of free speech and the right to consult their representatives." FN23 In enacting the Lloyd–La Follette Act, Congress weighed the competing policy considerations and concluded that efficient management of government operations did not preclude the extension of free speech rights to government employees.FN24&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Footnote 20. See 48 Cong.Rec. 4513 (1912) (remarks of Rep. Gregg) ("[I]t is for the purpose of wiping out the existence of this despicable 'gag rule' that this provision is inserted. The rule is unjust, unfair, and against the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, which provides for the right of appeal and the right of free speech to all its citizens.") A number of the bill's proponents asserted that the gag rule violated the First Amendment rights of civil servants. See, e.g., id., at 4653 (remarks of Rep. Calder) (1912); id., at 4738 (remarks of Rep. Blackmon); id., at 5201 (remarks of Rep. Prouty); id., at 5223 (remarks of Rep. O'Shaunessy); id., at 5634 (remarks of Rep. Lloyd); id., at 5637-5638 (remarks of Rep. Wilson); id., at 10671 (remarks of Sen. Ashurst); id., at 10673 (remarks of Sen. Reed); id., at 10793 (remarks of Sen. Smith); id., at 10799 (remarks of Sen. La Follette).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{quote|Footnote 22. This provision was accompanied by a more specific guarantee that membership in any independent association of postal employees seeking improvements in wages, hours, and working conditions, or the presentation to Congress of any grievance, "shall not constitute or be cause for reduction in rank or compensation or removal of such person or groups of persons from said service."

Footnote 23. H.R.Rep. No. 388, 62d Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1912).

Footnote 24. Members of the House, which originated § 6, suggested that it would improve the efficiency and morale of the civil service. "It will do away with the discontent and suspicion which now exists among the employees and will restore that confidence which is necessary to get the best results from the employees." 48 Cong.Rec. 4654 (1912) (remarks of Rep. Calder); see id., at 5635 (remarks of Rep. Lloyd).

The Senate Committee initially took a different position, urging in its report that the relevant language, see id., at 10732 (House version) be omitted entirely:

As to the last clause in section 6, it is the view of the committee that all citizens have a constitutional right as such to present their grievances to Congress or Members thereof. But governmental employees occupy a position relative to the Government different from that of ordinary citizens. Upon questions of interest to them as citizens, governmental employees have a [[right to petition]] Congress direct. A different rule should prevail with regard to their presentation of grievances connected with their relation to the Government as employees. In that respect good discipline and the efficiency of the service requires that they present their grievances through the proper administrative channels." S.Rep. No. 955, 62d Cong.2d Sess. 21 (1912).

As Sen. Bourne explained, "it was believed by the committee that to recognize the right of the individual employee to go over the head of his superior and go to Members of Congress on matters appertaining to his own particular grievances, or for his own selfish interest, would be detrimental to the service itself; that it would absolutely destroy the discipline necessary for good service." 48 Cong.Rec. 10676 (1912).

This view did not prevail. After extended discussion in floor debate concerning the right to organize and the right to present grievances to Congress, id., at 10671-10677, 10728-10733, 10792-10804, the committee offered and the Senate approved a compromise amendment to the House version, guaranteeing both rights at least in part, which was subsequently enacted into law. Id., at 10804; 37 Stat. 555.}}

==Subsequent legislation==

In 1997, the Justice Department argued that Congress does not have a constitutional right to obtain information from civil servants through unauthorized disclosures. Based on its analysis of disclosure laws and its stance on separation of powers, Justice argued that Congress cannot vest "in executive branch employees a right to provide classified information to members of Congress without official authorization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?articleid=13371&amp;printerfriendlyVers=1&amp; govexec.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Congress adopted an anti-gag rule.  The government-wide prohibition on the use of appropriated funds to pay the salary of any federal official who prohibits or prevents or threatens to prohibit or prevent a federal employee from contacting Congress first appeared in the [[Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act]], 1998, {{USPL|105|61}}, {{USStat|111|1318}}, (1997). In 1997, the Senate passed a prohibition that applied only to the Postal Service, while the House of Representatives passed a governmentwide prohibition. The conference report adopted the House version, and a government-wide prohibition has been included in every Treasury-Postal appropriations act since fiscal year 1998.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 105-284, at 50, 80 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

This provision has its antecedents in several older pieces of legislation, including the [[Treasury Department Appropriation Act of 1972]], the Lloyd–La Follette Act of 1912, and the [[Civil Service Reform Act of 1978]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/decisions/appro/302911.htm gao.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Rep. [[John Conyers]] included the Lloyd–La Follette Act in a list of 26 laws that he contends President [[George W. Bush]] violated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzflash.com/articles/alerts/95+ buzzflash.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/judiciary_democrats/iraqrept2.html house.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He was the eldest son of [[Ōkōchi Masatada]], son of [[Manabe Akikatsu]] and adopted son of [[Matsudaira Masatomo]].  He married a daughter of his uncle [[Ōkōchi Nobuhisa]], another son of Akikatsu but adopted by [[Matsudaira Nobuaki]], with whom he had issue, including [[Nobuhiro Ōkōchi]].

As the General Manager of TRANSCO CLSG,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sieh |first1=Rodney |title=Liberia: Low Cost Electricity, High Expectations - CLSG Chief Speaks |url=https://allafrica.com/stories/201509281927.html |website=allAfrica |accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammed Sherif has earned himself a place among young African leaders who are making strives to transform their countries into fast growing economies. He remained a great asset to the government of Liberia until his ascendance to the top position at the TRANSCO CLSG (Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea) which is interconnecting these countries to allow mutually beneficial power exchanges and a reliable electricity supply necessary for economic growth and consolidating the fragile peace that has been achieved so far in these countries.

== Meeting the challenges ==

Mohammed M. Sherif arrived at TRANSCO CLSG with the desire to ensure affordable electricity is restored to millions of people&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voanews.com/content/west-africa-teams-up-to-boost-power-production/2996575.html&lt;/ref&gt; in the Mano River Union. His vision for the future of TRANSCO CLSG is in line with the growing aspirations of the African continent. He plans to build on the successes of West African Power Pool (WAPP) and commit it to inclusive growth that boosts prosperity in the region, a support that will engender developing industries and increase employment as the route to poverty reduction. "My vision for what TRANSCO CLSG can do for Africa, is creating a cheaper, more reliable, more expansive energy network. Additionally I envisage a starting point for efforts in future cooperation, pooling risks, sharing costs, and gaining for economies of scale," said Sherif.

Mohammed Sherif&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/news/6355-light-at-end-of-tunnel-electricity-integration-for-west-africa Low cost electricity, high expectations]&lt;/ref&gt; believes that beyond 2017, the region will see a commercially viable company that is effective and efficient in ensuring the uninterrupted supply of affordable electricity within the CLSG and in ECOWAS.&lt;ref&gt;Liberia's long wait to turn on the lights http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/06/201261912122040806.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==TRANSCO CLSG==

In January, 2006, Members of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) established articles of agreement establishing a new [[West African Power Pool]] (WAPP) organization. The objective of the WAPP is to establish a regional [[electricity]] market in West Africa through the development of key priority infrastructures that will permit accessibility to economic energy resources, to all member states of the ECOWAS. The Côte d'Ivoire – Liberia – Sierra Leone – Guinea Interconnection Project is one of the major sub-programs of the West Africa Power Pool (WAPP), with the aim to integrate the four post conflict countries into the same regional electricity market; by a high capacity transmission interconnection from Côte d'Ivoire to Guinea through Sierra Leone and Liberia. Supply of adequate and reliable electric power supply will improve security, good governance, the development of industry as well as improve the quality life of local communities.

Cote 'd'Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are part of what many consider a flagship electricity project that could pay off handsomely for Sub-Saharan Africa - and spark an economic transformation for countries struggling to stay afloat. Andrew M Herscowitz, the Coordinator for US President Barack Obama's Power Africa and Trade Africa initiatives has said that investment in energy infrastructure in Africa will help unlock potential in what is already the world's fastest-growing continent, with positive results for global growth.

[[File:Powerintegration.jpg|thumb|Mohammed Mohammed Sherif eyeing electricity integration through TRANSCO CLSG]]The CLSG's line is a 1,303 kilometer stretch, coming from Man to Danane; from Danane to Yekepa; from Yekepa to Buchanan; from Buchanan to Mount Coffee; from Mount Coffee to Bo Waterside, which provides huge opportunities for Liberia. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), through its West Africa Power Pool (WAPP) has made regional power grid access a priority for the next decade. Thus, the establishment of TRANSCO CLSG has created burgeoning opportunities across the region.

The WAPP intends to integrate the various national power systems into a unified regional electricity market - with the expectation that such mechanism would, over the medium to long-term, assure the citizens of ECOWAS member states a stable and reliable electricity supply at affordable costs, facilitating the balanced development of diverse energy resources for their collective economic benefit, through long-term energy sector cooperation, unimpeded energy transit and increasing cross-border electricity trade.

A '''mommy track''' is a path in a woman's life that puts priority to being a [[mother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mommy+track|title=Mommy track|accessdate=2015-09-05|publisher=Farlex dictionary}}&lt;br&gt;In turn citing: Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged, HarperCollins Publishers 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It can also specifically refer to work arrangements for [[women in the workforce]] that facilitate motherhood, such as flexible hours, but at the same time usually provides fewer opportunities for career advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mommy+track|title=Mommy track|accessdate=2015-09-05|publisher=Farlex dictionary}}&lt;br&gt;In turn citing: American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition. 2011 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewin"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/08/us/mommy-career-track-sets-off-a-furor.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=Mommy Career Track Sets Off a Furor |author=Tamar Lewin |date=8 Mar 1989 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=9 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; References to the mommy track often go along with being a [[housewife]], "opting out" of the workforce, temporarily or even permanently. Women following the mommy track may be contrasted to [[career women]] who prioritize their careers more than having children.

==Origins of 'mommy track'==
Writer [[Jennifer A. Kingson]] introduced the term "mommy track" in an August 8, 1988, article in [[The New York Times]], in which she described the career hurdles faced by law firm associates who sacrificed advancement potential once they had children.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/08/us/women-in-the-law-say-path-is-limited-by-mommy-track.html?pagewanted=&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Felice Schwartz]]’s 1989 article in the ''Harvard Business Journal'' is sometimes called the first discussion of the mommy track phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2010/03/the_mommy_track_turns_21.html |title=The 'Mommy Track' turns 21 |author=Angie Kim |date=31 March 2010 |work=[[Slate Magazine]] |accessdate=9 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz claims in the article that while “the cost of employing women in management is greater than the cost of employing men,”&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; this greater cost is due primarily to gendered expectations of the workplace and women’s duties in raising children.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;  Schwartz wrote:
{{quote|The misleading metaphor of the [[glass ceiling]] suggests an invisible barrier constructed by corporate leaders to impede the upward mobility of women beyond the middle levels. A more appropriate metaphor, I believe, is the kind of cross-sectional diagram used in geology. The barriers to women’s leadership occur when potentially counterproductive layers of influence on women—maternity, tradition, socialization—meet management strata pervaded by the largely unconscious preconceptions, [[stereotypes]], and expectations of men. Such interfaces do not exist for men and tend to be impermeable for women.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schwartz's assertions generated widespread publicity and a new conversation about women in the workplace. ''[[The New York Times]],'' having coined the term in 1988, described ''mommy track'' in greater detail in a March 8, 1989 article, "Mommy Career Track Sets Off Furor" which discussed Schwartz's article and the response to it in the public sphere. The article described the mommy track as a phenomenon "in which women with family responsibilities are shunted into dead-end, lower-paying jobs."&lt;ref name="Lewin"/&gt;

==Wage gap for mothers==
{{Main|Motherhood penalty}}
Across different pay levels and [[socioeconomic]] groups, women’s earnings tend to plateau after giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde et al, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Even when controlling for variables, on average mothers in all groups earn lower wages than non-mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde et al, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this general drop in earnings, though, there are significant differences in mothers’ [[Gender pay gap|wage gaps]] between high-earning women and low-earning women.

===High-earning women===
High-earning women appear to bear much higher costs of [[childbirth]] than low-earning women. In the US, choosing to have children will force a woman to give up 21 to 33 percent of her lifetime earnings, a loss that could cost up to hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde et al, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years after having children, a highly skilled woman with children remains at a pay level 24% lower than non-mothers even when time out of the workforce is taken into account.&lt;ref name="Wilde et al, p. 18"&gt;Wilde et al, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; This group of women also seems to face greater discrimination within the workplace; only 16% of all law firm partners are women, a discrepancy absent from lower-skilled professions.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-skilled women tend to have flatter wage-earning trajectories than their low-skilled counterparts after giving birth, primarily seen in a lack of wage growth.&lt;ref name="Kornberg, p. 200"&gt;Kornberg, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low-earning women===
Low-earning women who have children are sacrificing about 10 to 14 percent of their total lifetime earnings.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde et al, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Even ten years after having children, a mother in the US in this income bracket earns wages that are about 12% lower than non-mother, low-skilled women.&lt;ref name="Wilde et al, p. 18"/&gt; This group of mothers tends to experience a one-time fall in pay immediately after childbirth of about 6%, but after that initial fall the wage gap between women with children and those without does not continue to grow over time.&lt;ref name="Kornberg, p. 200"/&gt;

==Part-time work and flexibility==
A theory frequently cited for why mothers earning lower wages than other women that is the fact that mothers tend to spend fewer hours in the workplace than non-mothers.&lt;ref name="Hymowitz"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/miarticle.htm?id=7342 |title=Women Prefer the Mommy Track |author=Kay S. Hymowitz |date=4 August 2011 |work=[[Manhattan Institute]] |accessdate=9 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A report in 2014 by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] stated that employed men worked 52 minutes more than employed women on the days they worked, and that this difference partly reflects women's greater likelihood of working [[part-time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm|title=American Time Use Survey|date=June 24, 2015|publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part-time work and [[flextime]] or more flexible arrangements are seen as hallmarks of the mommy track, since they point to women not being in the workplace full-time. However, this is changing as more people—men and women alike—choose more flexible work arrangements that allow for more free time.&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt;

==Cultural pressures and influences==
In the years since the women’s liberation movement and [[second-wave feminism]], [[gender roles]] have become more complicated and less dogmatic.&lt;ref&gt;Blair-Loy, Mary. "Cultural Constructions of Family Schemas: The Case of Women Finance Executives." Gender and Society. Sage Publications, Inc. 15.5 (Oct. 2001), p. 690&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the modern ideal of “intensive parenting,” first described by Sharon Hays, ensures that mothers continue to take primary responsibility for raising children due to the engrained [[social norm]] that women are better nurturers.&lt;ref&gt;Hays, Sharon. The Cultural Conditions of Motherhood. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1996, p. 129. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the reasons that while both men and women report having increased trouble with their [[work-life balance]] after having a baby, women are the only ones whose hours working decrease as a response to this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, Mary E. and Mary C. Noonan. "The Mommy Track and Partnership: Temporary Delay or Dead End?" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. The American Academy of Political and Social Science 596 (Nov. 2004), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, women who cannot afford to pay someone else to take care of [[domestic work]] are faced with the [[double burden]] of working outside of the home while continuing to complete the majority of domestic work in the home.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Arlie, with Anne Machung. The Second Shift: Working Parents and the Revolution at Home. New York, NY: Viking, 1989. Print. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cultural influence on mothers' decreased presence in the workforce is [[gender discrimination]] within the U.S. tax code. Since domestic labor in one’s own home is unpaid and untaxed, and women continue to do a majority of domestic labor as a result of societal norms, in many households it may seem less expensive for a woman to take care of this labor than to go to work and pay someone else to cook, clean, and care for children.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; The tax code also sees men as the primary earners and women as secondary earners, so men benefit from joint filing while women’s earnings are frequently subject to higher taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many [[feminist]]s saw the idea of the mommy track as divisive to women and therefore one that could have a detrimental effect to the feminist cause. Since Schwartz’s initial article proposed sorting women into two categories based on their devotion to careers,&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p.66&lt;/ref&gt; some saw this as a division between women that both forced them into narrow categories and ignored any existing differences between men.&lt;ref name="Lewin"/&gt;

There is also an ongoing discussion of whether the wage gap that results from a mommy track is any sort of societal discrimination against women, or basically an effect of mothers choosing to spend more time away from work.&lt;ref name="Hymowitz"/&gt;

==Mommy track in different countries==

===United States===
In a 2005 study, in the US, it has been estimated that 31% of working mothers left the workplace (for an average of 2.2 years), most often precipitated by the birth of the second child.&lt;ref&gt;Hewlett, S. A., Luce, C. B., Shiller, P. &amp; Southwell,S (2005, March). The hidden brain drain: Off-ramps and on-ramps in women’s careers. Center for WorkLife. Policy/Harvard Business Review Research. Report, Product no. 9491. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Publishing Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the US was one of only three countries in the world (the other two being [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Suriname]]) that does not have laws that require employers to provide paid [[maternity leave]].&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-industrialized-nation-paid-maternity-leave/story?id=30852419&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
Japan’s social norms, like those of the U.S., help to cause many women to move into part-time work upon having children. However, unlike the U.S., Japanese mothers rarely return to full-time work after having children.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; Even more so than other developed countries, Japan has an especially high proportion of women who work part-time, and a majority of those women are mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; Common business practices in Japan further penalize mothers who may have taken leave from the workplace at some point, due to companies choosing to only recruit directly from universities and setting upper limits on age for full-time positions.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]] women have entered the workforce relatively recently. Throughout much of the 20th century, women faced many legal and social obstacles preventing them from working. Although in the late 1950s, the Netherlands made important legal changes, such as removing the [[marriage bar]] and the [[marital power]] of the husband, it was only in 1984 that full legal equality between husband and wife was achieved - prior to 1984 the law stipulated that the husband's opinion prevailed over the wife's regarding issues such as decisions on children's education and the domicile of the family, reflecting the traditional structure of the society.&lt;ref&gt;https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168045ae0e&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/Gender/publication/Netherlands_2015_Review_BPFA_Report_of_the_Netherlands_Government.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, according to ''[[The Economist]]'',  "[Dutch] politics was dominated by Christian values until the 1980s", which meant that Dutch women were slower to enter into the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/05/economist-explains-12&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, the Commission of the [[European Communities]] report ''Women in the European Community'' found that "it is  in  the  Netherlands (17.6%)  and  in  Ireland  (13.6%)  that  we  see  the  smallest  numbers  of  married  women  working  and  the  least  acceptance  of  this  phenomenon  by  the  general  public". (pg 14).&lt;ref&gt;http://aei.pitt.edu/4560/1/4560.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1980s onwards, the numbers of women entering the workplace have increased, but most of the women [[part time job|work part time]]. In 2012, 76.9% of employed women worked part-time, well above the European Union average of 32.1%.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/epo_campaign/131205_country_profile_netherlands.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===The United Kingdom===
The UK has less working mothers than many other Western countries. Lack of sufficient childcare and social stigma against working mothers have been cited as reasons.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/24/you-want-career-and-a-baby&lt;/ref&gt; In general, women in the UK have one of the highest rate of part-time work in Europe. A report by [[OECD]] which looked at the OECD members, as well as at other countries from inside and outside Europe, found that only the Netherlands and Switzerland had a higher percentage of women working part-time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/LMF_1_6_Gender_differences_in_employment_outcomes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the UK face one of the worst [[motherhood penalty|motherhood penalties]] among Western countries: "[mothers] find significant motherhood wage  penalties  in  several  Continental  Northern  European  countries  (Austria,  the  Netherlands  and Germany)  and  Anglophone  countries  (Canada,  the  UK and  the  US)".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---inst/documents/publication/wcms_206235.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Council]], in a recommendation to the UK (which is non-binding), has criticized the UK because "The difference in the share of part-time work between women (42,6 % in 2013) and men (13,2 % in 2013) is one of the highest in the Union. The percentage of women who are inactive or work part-time due to personal and family responsibilities (12,5 %) was almost twice as high as the EU average (6,3 %) in 2013...[e]ven if supply in the childcare system has increased recently, the availability of affordable, high-quality, full-time childcare remains a key issue."&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.C_.2015.272.01.0021.01.ENG&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nordic countries===
In the [[Nordic countries]], marriage and having children have far greater effects on women than on men, partly due to the expectation that women will continue unpaid domestic labor.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Nordic countries have worked to make the dual-earner household the norm, with nationalized childcare, parental leave, and flexible working hours making it possible for women to continue to work.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2007 UNICEF report, in Sweden, although parents are given 12 months of parental leave time that can be divided between the two as each couple sees best, gender norms continue to have an effect: mandated maternity leave combined with Sweden allowing women to reduce work hours after giving birth means that nearly half of mothers in dual-income families work less than full-time.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;UNICEF. 2007. “A Call for Equality,” in The State of the World’s Children. New York: United Nations Children’s Fund. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Although women in Nordic countries have a high overall labour participation, there is a strong segregation by gender with women being often found in certain work sectors, which have a working culture adapted to family life, with flexible hours and offers of part-time jobs, and men working in other sectors. According to the Nordic Information on Gender "The gender-segregated labour market is a main reason why women are more likely to work part time in the Nordic countries than elsewhere in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nikk.no/en/news/gender-segregation-in-labour-market-leads-to-part-time-culture/&lt;/ref&gt; However, this part-time work culture does not extend to Finland, where for historical reasons  there was a shortage of labour in the country, which increased the need for women to work full time - as such, the part-time culture of the other Nordic countries was never established in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nikk.no/en/news/gender-segregation-in-labour-market-leads-to-part-time-culture/&lt;/ref&gt; Finland has a longer tradition of mothers working, compared to the other Nordic countries: in 1978, 73% of Finnish mothers of  0 - 6 year olds were employed, compared to 69% of Swedish and only  48% of Norwegian.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nikk.no/wp-content/uploads/NIKKpub_deltid1_temanord.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2014, Sweden's employment rate for women was the highest in the EU28, and was only slightly below that of men (73% female rate vs. 76.5% male rate). This compared with the EU28 rate of 58.8% female vs 69% male.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Employment_rates_for_selected_population_groups,_2004%E2%80%9314_%28%25%29_YB16.png&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicandro Durante''' (born 13 September 1956) is a Brazilian businessman, the chief executive (CEO) of [[British American Tobacco]] plc (informally BAT), the world's largest tobacco company by sales.

==Early life==
Durante was born in Goias, Brazil, and is of Italian ancestry. Durante has a bachelor's degree in Finance, Economics and Business Administration from the [[Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo]]. 

==Career==
Durante joined BAT's Brazilian subsidiary Souza Cruz in 1981. In January 2008, he was appointed BAT's chief operating officer, and in March 2011 became chief executive.  In late 2018 BAT announced that Durante would retire at the end of March 2019. &lt;ref name="FT_012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c7ae8b88-0960-11e2-a5e3-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2AmHd92bO|title=The running man of Big Tobacco|date=30 September 2012|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durante is BAT's first non-British CEO. During his tenure as CEO, BAT's share price has doubled. &lt;ref name="cigar2" /&gt; It collapsed in 2018 as it appeared he had misjudged the FDA's attitude towards menthol cigarettes and that BAT had hopelessly overpaid in the acquisition of the Reynolds minorities in July 2017 (at the time the largest ever foreign investment into a US firm).  His retirement came at a highly controversial time in the firms history. 

In 2015 he took home almost £8 million &lt;ref name="BAT chief pay jumps2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/03/22/bat-chiefs-pay-jumps-by-1m-despite-shareholder-backlash/|title=BAT chief pay jumps|date=22 March 2016|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 he asked for a raise to reach £10 million saying he deserves another £2 million &lt;ref name="BAT chief pay jumps2" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Durante enjoys cigar-smoking, the opera, running and playing football. He is married with two children. &lt;ref name="cigar2"&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c27c2de4-977a-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582|title=The cigar-smoking, football-playing Brazilian behind Reynolds bid|last=Shubber|first=Kadhim|date=October 21, 2016|newspaper=Financial Times|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24615">A '''patent box''' is a special tax regime used by several countries to incentivise research and development by taxing [[intellectual property|patent]] revenues differently from other commercial revenues. It is also known as '''intellectual property box regime''', innovation box or '''IP box'''.

==History==
In the early 1970s Ireland introduced the first scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardinal-ip.com/ip-news-strategy/the-patent-box/|title=The Patent Box|publisher=Cardinal-ip.com|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Seán Lemass and after|Corporation Tax]]. Section 34 of the 1973 Finance Act allowed total tax relief in respect of royalties and other income from licenses patented in Ireland. 

The concept was applied in 2001 by the French Tax Authorities as a reduced rate of tax on revenue from IP licensing or the transfer of qualified IP.&lt;ref&gt;ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/dp/dp13070.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Within Europe, Belgium, Hungary, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom have also introduced similar schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neocleous.com/assets/modules/neo/publications/1592/docs/Global_Tax_Weekly.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916035601/http://neocleous.com/assets/modules/neo/publications/1592/docs/Global_Tax_Weekly.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The Irish Patent Box system is one of the key benefits for companies paying Irish corporation tax. The system was criticised by [[Lionel Jospin]] in the early 2000s and more recently by both the EU (Ecofin assessment 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belastingrechtaandevu.nl/Portals/0/images/140702_Sheets_panel2.pdf|format=PDF|title=EU and OECD aspects of IP-regimes|publisher=Belastingrechtaandevu.nl|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the OECD under its [[Base erosion and profit shifting (OECD project)|Base Erosion and Profit-Shifting (BEPS) project.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/financial-services/review-of-patent-tax-regimes-in-eu-has-irish-support-1.1905477|title=Review of patent tax regimes in EU has Irish support|work=Irish Times|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system has been key to attracting international IT companies to Ireland. The economic benefits of beneficial tax regimes for revenues from patents led to similar schemes being introduced in France in 2000 and amended in 2005 &amp; 2010.

==Schemes by country==

===Cyprus===
IP box rules were changed in October 2016, valid since July 2016 - reduced the list of the qualified IP incomes, no patents nor trademarks anymore. 80% of income is exempted after deducting the real expenses, giving an effective tax rate of 2.5% or less.

===Ireland===
{{main article|Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland}}
The scheme which had existed since 1973 was withdrawn in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2012/02/16/00064.asp|title=Dáil Éireann - 16/Feb/2012 Written Answers - Tax Code|publisher=Debates.oireachtas.ie|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revenue.ie/en/press/budget/archive/2011/budget-2011-summary.pdf|format=PDF|title=BUDGET SUMMARY 2011 |publisher=Revenue.ie|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the National recovery Plan 2011-2015 of the Republic of Ireland. It exempted revenue from qualifying Patents from Irish corporation tax. The exemption is to be replaced by a “[[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Knowledge development box|Knowledge Development Box]]” in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/budget-2015-new-knowledge-box-tax-incentive-scheme-to-be-targeted-in-eu-probe-30671379.html|title=Budget 2015: New 'knowledge box' tax incentive scheme to be targeted in EU probe|work=Independent.ie|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-10-15/goodbye-double-irish-hello-knowledge-box|title=Goodbye Double Irish, Hello Knowledge Box|author=Leonid Bershidsky|work=BloombergView.com|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering a reduced tax rate of 6.25% on qualifying profits generated in periods commencing on or after 1 January 2016.

The key difference in the Irish KDB to those of other European countries is its compliance with the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New Knowledge Box will help increase investment into Ireland – Budget Statement|url = http://www.idaireland.com/newsroom/budget-statement/|website = www.idaireland.com|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; programme, Ireland’s is the first patent-box type system to offer compliance in this area. Companies availing of the current R&amp;D tax credit should be aware of the KDB and the potential for them to take advantage of both systems.

===France===
Introduced in 1979&lt;ref&gt;Code général des impôts Légifrance&lt;/ref&gt; the Patents and royalties regime allows companies paying French corporation tax to pay a reduced rate of 15% (instead of 33%) on patent and royalties income&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifiscal.fr/fiche-pratique/imposition-benefices/calcul-resultat-fiscal.html|title=Calcul résultat fiscal impot société is LégiFiscal|publisher=Legifiscal.fr|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they are treated as a long term capital gain. If the licensee is a French corporation and actually uses the qualified IP licensed, the licensee may deduct the royalty payments from its income taxable at the standard 33.33% rate even if the licensor is taxed at the reduced 15% rate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jetro.go.jp/world/europe/ip/pdf/european_patent_box_regimes_en.pdf|title=European patent box regimes|publisher=Japan External Trade Organisation|accessdate=19 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226033009/http://www.jetro.go.jp/world/europe/ip/pdf/european_patent_box_regimes_en.pdf|archivedate=26 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands introduced a patent box tax regime referred to as the ‘innovation box’ in January 2007. This initial regime applied only to patents and applied a 10% rate of corporate tax. On 1 January 2010 the regime was expanded to include a much wider range of IP and the headline rate was reduced to 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://innovativetax.com/news/dutch-ip-innovation-box-effective-tax-rate-of-5-on-r-d-activities.html|title=Dutch IP Innovation Box: effective tax rate of 5% on R &amp; D activities|publisher=Innovativetax.com|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduced rate of corporate tax applies to the net positive income derived from the qualifying IP ( gross income minus all related expenses and depreciation).

===Belgium ===
The patent box scheme in Belgium was introduced in January 2007, and is known as a patent income deduction (PID). The last revision applies from July 2016. This PID allows a company, liable to pay Corporation Tax in Belgium, to deduct from its taxable income 85% of gross patent income. The remaining 15% of gross patent income is taxed at the standard corporation tax rate of 34% (including a 3% surtax). This results in an effective tax rate of 5.1% on the qualifying income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/blog/checkpoint/belgium-enacts-patent-box-incentive-regime/|title=Belgium Enacts Patent Box Incentive Regime|date=2017-02-28|work=Thomson Reuters Tax &amp; Accounting|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luxembourg===
The Luxembourg IP regime has been abolished. IP regimes claimed before July 2016 can still continue to benefit from the preferential rate for the next 5 years. It is expected that Luxembourg creates a new IP regime following the OECD criteria.

In Luxembourg IP regime became effective in January 2008 and amended in 2008 to also exclude qualifying IP assets from Luxembourg’s net wealth tax. The scheme applies to the net income derived from the use of qualifying intellectual property acquired or developed after December 2007. 80% of income is exempted, giving an effective tax rate of 5.76%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/invest-luxembourg/intellectual-property/index.html|title=Intellectual Property|publisher=Luxembourg.public.lu|accessdate=19 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018225721/http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/invest-luxembourg/intellectual-property/index.html|archivedate=18 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
Hungary introduced a scheme in 2003 including a provision according to which 50% of the pre-tax amount of the royalties received may be deducted from the tax base, this reducing the effective corporate tax rate on such royalties from 9% to 4.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itpa.org/?p=6640|title=The International Tax Planning Association Library – Hungary's New Position in the Royalty Planning Industry by Dr Willem G.

===Spain===
As of January 1, 2008, 50% of the gross income of Spanish domiciled companies derived from qualified Intellectual Property is exempt from Spain’s Corporation tax resulting in an effective tax rate of 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/washington-national-tax/assets/Merrill0326.pdf|format=PDF|title=Is It Time for the United States to Consider the Patent Box?|publisher=Pwc.com|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom introduced a Patent Box scheme in 2013 taxing qualifying IP at 10%.
The Patent Box in the UK is a tax incentive introduced in 2013 designed to encourage companies to make profits from their patents by reducing the UK tax paid on those profits.

====History====
The UK Patent Box went live in April 2013. The [[UK]] government wants to encourage high-value growth in [[Economy of the United Kingdom|UK plc]] through a competitive tax regime that supports UK [[R&amp;D]] from conception to commercialisation. The Patent Box forms a key part of this strategy by encouraging companies to ''commercialise'' their [[patents]] and R&amp;D in the UK. Other countries (eg.Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands) already operate schemes to provide incentives for companies to retain and commercialise existing patents

The scheme was first proposed in the 2009 Pre-Budget Report and went through various iterations and public consultations until final legislation was passed in the [[Finance Act]] 2012. The legislation is now formally a new Part 8A of the [[Corporation Tax Act 2010]] entitled "Profits Arising from the Exploitation of Patents etc". The Finance (No.2 Bill) 2015/16 includes proposed amendments, which, if implemented, will amend the patent box rules.

The Patent Box initiative is complementary to the R&amp;D tax incentives which encourage companies to ''undertake'' their R&amp;D in the UKhb

The Patent Box allows a 10% tax rate on [[profit (accounting)|profits]] derived from any products that incorporate patents. The net benefit for claiming companies is likely to be several percentage points of their corporate earnings, given that the main rate of [[UK corporation tax]] is 20 per cent.

The steady state cost, after the initial phasing- in period, of the Patent Box is forecast to be approximately £1.1 billion in terms of corporation tax revenues foregone by HM Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Budget 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim process is as follows:
*calculate qualifying income by identifying revenue streams from qualifying patents, 
*calculate the profit generated from this qualifying income, 
*then calculate residual profit by deducting routine profit made from routine business activities,
*then calculate the Patent box profit by deducting any profits derived from branding or marketing attributes
* then use the [[HMRC]] formula to calculate the corporate tax deduction.

====How to claim====
Companies must calculate their qualifying Patent Box profit and then apply a specific formula in their tax computation to calculate the deduction in their tax liability. Then they can take the tax deduction as a benefit in their CT600 tax return.
The formula to calculate the amount of the tax deduction is

 &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P} \mathbf{B} *\left ( \frac {MR-PBR} {MR} \right )&lt;/math&gt;
where 
*PB is the Patent Box profit for the company,
*MR is the main rate of corporation tax, and 
*PBR is the special Patent Box tax rate (10 per cent)

====Qualifying patents====
Qualifying patents must have been granted by an approved patent-granting body, including the [[UK Intellectual Property Office]], the [[European Patent Office]], and designated European territories:&lt;ref&gt;HMRC,[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/cirdmanual/CIRD210160.htm "CIRD Patent Box manual"] Retrieved 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UK Statutory Instrument 2013 No. 420 The Profits from Patents (EEA Rights) Order 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Austria; Bulgaria; the Czech republic; Denmark; Estonia; Finland; Germany; Hungary; Poland; Portugal; Romania; Slovakia and Sweden.

Currently, the Patent Box excludes patents registered in territories such as the USA, France, and Spain because of differences in the search and approval process for patent applications.

The Patent Box excludes products that only have [[copyright]] or [[trademark]] protection.

====Qualifying income====
There are five categories (“heads”) of qualifying income: 
*'''head 1''': worldwide income from the sale of products incorporating at least one embedded patent (and including income from sale of integral spare parts)
*'''head 2''': licence fees or [[royalties]] from qualifying [[Intellectual Property|IP]]
*'''head 3''': sale or disposal of qualifying IP and rights over qualifying IP 
*'''heads 4 &amp; 5''': damages/compensation income from infringement/loss of sales of qualifying IP rights

Income generated from exclusive licenses will be qualifying income on both sides of the agreement – i.e. for the licensor ''and'' the licensee – subject to specific conditions concerning the meaning of exclusivity.

“IP-derived income”, where patented products or processes are used in the manufacture or delivery of non-patented products or services, will be qualifying income to the extent of a notional royalty which values the specific patented product or process as a proportion of the value of the non-patented product or service.

====Qualifying company====
*must hold qualifying IP rights
*must elect into the scheme
*must fulfill “development” and/or “active ownership” conditions

====Details in the legislation to look out for====
*notional [[royalties|royalty]] 
*notional [[marketing]] royalty and marketing intangibles (including [[transfer pricing]])
*streaming
*meaning of exclusivity
*R&amp;D shortfall

====Anti-avoidance====
The following situations will be against the law:
*where a functionally irrelevant patent is incorporated into a product with the sole purpose of achieving Patent Box eligibility 
*commercially irrelevant grant of exclusivity with the sole purpose of achieving Patent Box eligibility 
*any scheme designed to inflate artificially qualifying IP income or qualifying Patent Box profits.
Reasonable and commercially appropriate steps to restructure corporate arrangements to take advantage of the Patent Box will be considered legitimate.

====Other technology tax reliefs====
*[[Research and Development Tax Credit]]
*[[Research and Development Expenditure Credit]]
*Above the Line R&amp;D Tax Relief
*[[Research and Development Capital Allowances]] 
*[[Creative Sector Tax Relief]]s including Video Games Tax Relief, Animation Tax Relief, High-end TV Production Tax Relief, and Film Tax Relief

The [[Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (EIS) and [[Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme]] (SEIS) give generous income and capital gains tax relief to individuals who invest in small early stage businesses.

====Government working group====
The government established a working group to complement wider consultation on the Patent Box and to discuss options and proposals in more detail. Members of the Working Group include representatives from: [[HMRC]] and [[HM Treasury]]; industry ([[GlaxoSmithKline]]; [[Dyson (company)|Dyson]]; [[ARM Holdings|ARM]]'''[[Syngenta]]), the financial services community including large accounting firms ([[PWC]]; [[Deloitte]]; [[KPMG]]; [[Ernst and Young]]); independent consultants and representatives from the technology commercialisation sphere and professional bodies.

====OECD Forum for Harmful Tax Practices and the EU Code of Conduct Group====
The UK government is in the process of gathering evidence to submit to the [[Forum for Harmful Tax Practices]] (FHTP), part of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), in the forum's work on international base erosion and profit shifting, specifically Action Point 5 of the OECD Action Plan published in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Publishing, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264202719-en: "OECD (2013), Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting."] Retrieved 09 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The forum provides member countries with the opportunity to review each other’s tax arrangements and to challenge harmful tax initiatives.

Action 5 focuses on “substantial activity” that must occur in a jurisdiction for a company to benefit from a specific preferential tax regime.

The UK government publicly supports the current work around Action 5 to ensure a better understanding of what constitutes economic substance when businesses carry out R&amp;D activities, so as to effectively address those instances where preferential tax regimes might present an opportunity to shift profits.&lt;ref&gt;HM Treasury March 2014, [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-aggressive-tax-planning-in-the-global-economy-uk-priorities-for-the-g20-oecd-project-for-countering-base-erosion-and-profit-shifting  "Tackling aggressive tax planning in the global economy: UK priorities for the G20-OECD project for countering Base Erosion and Profit Shifting."] Retrieved 09 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Options being discussed include a new method of calculating benefits for IP-incentive tax schemes.  This is the so-called nexus approach (where underlying expenditure to create the IP is used to define the proportion of qualifying income generated from the IP), rather than the conventional transfer pricing approach (where transfer pricing principles define a substantial activity test and either the IP commercialisation activity passes the test or it does not, and all IP income thus either qualifies or it does not).

These discussions are also informed by work being carried out by the [[Economic and Financial Affairs Council]] (ECOFIN) and the EU Code of Conduct Group, which started in 2013 to look at the workings of the UK Patent Box scheme. The Code of Conduct Group operates on a similar basis to the FHTP. The Code of Conduct Group partnered with the FHTP in these discussions in early 2014.

====Anglo-German accord on the UK Patent Box====
Following a sustained period of international tax scrutiny led by Germany in the FHTP and the EU Code of Conduct Group, a compromise agreement for the UK patent box scheme based on a modified nexus approach was announced by the UK and Germany on 11 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;UK Government November 2014, [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/373135/GERMANY_UK_STATEMENT.pdf  "Proposals for New Rules for Preferential IP Regimes"] Retrieved 2 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptance of a nexus based approach will have significant implications for the UK patent box scheme; fundamentally, patent box relief will now be restricted to profits generated from IP initially developed in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmp-tax.co.uk/pdfs/A_fresh_start_for_UK_patent_box_28112014.pdf|title= A fresh start for the UK's patent box scheme.|journal=LexisNexis PSL tax|date=28 November 2014 |accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main points in the Anglo-German accord have been announced as follows:
*a 30% uplift will be allowed to increase the value of the eligible R&amp;D expenditure proxy for outsourcing or acquisition costs 
*the existing UK regime will be closed to new entrants (for both products and patents) in June 2016 (and the existing scheme will be abolished in full by June 2021)
*IP within the existing regime will be able to retain the benefits of the scheme until June 2021, to allow time for transition to the new nexus regime 
*a practical and proportionate tracking and tracing approach will be introduced that can be implemented by companies and tax authorities with practical methodologies that companies and tax authorities can adopt to map R&amp;D expenditure to IP creation. 
The UK and Germany submitted their proposal to the OECD Forum on Harmful Tax Practices during its meeting on 17–19 November, and they have also committed to seek formal approval from the OECD and [[G20]] at the January 2015 meeting of the OECD’s Committee on Fiscal Affairs.

===Switzerland===

====Mixed-company====
Switzerland allows companies who predominantly trade internationally to benefit from the advantageous “mixed-company” status that allows them to be taxed at a rate of just 8,5%. In 2007 the European Commission alleged the tax schemes for holding, mixed and domiciliary companies violated the 1972 [[Free Trade Agreement|FTA]]    between the EU and Switzerland as it was State Aid. Although the Swiss government refuted the allegation in May 2012 the Swiss cantons gave the federal government the go-ahead to commence a tax dialogue with the EU. In May 2014 the EU and Switzerland reached an agreement whereby the disputed tax regimes would be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sif.admin.ch/sif/en/home/themen/internationale-steuerpolitik/unternehmensbesteuerung/eu-unternehmenssteuerdialog.html|title=Dialogue with the EU|author=[[State Secretariat for International Financial Matters]]|publisher=Sif.admin.ch|accessdate=19 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024161128/https://www.sif.admin.ch/sif/en/home/themen/internationale-steuerpolitik/unternehmensbesteuerung/eu-unternehmenssteuerdialog.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nidwalden Licence-Box regime====
In 2011 the canton of Nidwalden introduced the Licence Box rule which allows companies located in Nidwalden to benefit from a cantonal tax rate on net license income reduced by 80% the effective corporate income tax rate is 8.8%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpmg.com/CH/en/Library/Articles-Publications/Documents/Tax/pub_20110420_IP-Location-Switzerland_EN.pdf |title=IP Location Switzerland |date=April 2011|publisher=www.kpmg.ch |accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Charlespfizer.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Charles Pfizer]]
Pfizer was founded in 1849 by German-American [[Charles Pfizer]] and his cousin [[Charles F. Erhart]] from [[Ludwigsburg]], Germany. They launched the chemicals business Charles Pfizer and Company from a building at the intersection of Harrison Avenue and Bartlett Street&lt;ref name="Citycyclopedia"&gt;Kenneth T. Jackson. ''The Encyclopedia of New York City''. The New York Historical Society; Yale University Press; September 1995. P. 895. {{ISBN|978-0-300-05536-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], where they produced an antiparasitic called [[santonin]]. This was an immediate success, although it was the production of citric acid that really kick-started Pfizer's growth in the 1880s. Pfizer continued to buy property to expand its lab and factory on the block bounded by Bartlett Street, Harrison Avenue, Gerry Street, and Flushing Avenue. Pfizer's original administrative headquarters was at 81 Maiden Lane in Manhattan.&lt;ref name="Citycyclopedia"/&gt;

By 1906, sales totaled $3.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Pfizer|url=http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/charles_pfizer|publisher=Pfizer|accessdate=9 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510151810/http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/charles_pfizer|archivedate=May 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World War I caused a shortage of [[calcium citrate]] which Pfizer imported from Italy for the manufacture of citric acid, and the company began a search for an alternative supply. Pfizer chemists learned of a fungus that ferments sugar to citric acid, and they were able to commercialize production of citric acid from this source in 1919, and the company developed expertise in fermentation technology as a result. These skills were applied to the mass production of the antibiotic [[penicillin]] during World War II in response to the need to treat injured Allied soldiers; most of the penicillin that went ashore with the troops on [[D-Day]] was made by Pfizer.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite newsgroup | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlamattina/2014/07/16/a-plan-for-big-pharma-involvement-in-superbug-rd/ | title=A Plan For Big Pharma Involvement In Superbug R&amp;D | date=2014-07-16 | accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penicillin became very inexpensive in the 1940s, and Pfizer searched for new antibiotics with greater profit potential. They discovered [[oxytetracycline|Terramycin (oxytetracycline)]] in 1950, and this changed the company from a manufacturer of fine chemicals to a research-based pharmaceutical company. Pfizer developed a drug discovery program focusing on in vitro synthesis in order to augment its research in fermentation technology. The company also established an animal health division in 1959 with an {{convert|700|acre|km2 |adj=on}} farm and research facility in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]].

By the 1950s, Pfizer had established offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom. In 1960, the company moved its medical research laboratory operations out of New York City to a new facility in Groton, Connecticut. In 1980, they launched [[piroxicam|Feldene (piroxicam)]], a prescription anti-inflammatory medication that became Pfizer's first product to reach one billion dollars in total sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pfizer Inc: Exploring Our History 1951–1999|url=http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/1951-1999|publisher=Pfizer}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s and 1990s, Pfizer Corporation growth was sustained by the discovery and marketing of Zoloft, Lipitor, Norvasc, Zithromax, Aricept, Diflucan, and Viagra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/07/19/companies/pfizer/|title=Pfizer to pay $20M federal fine; posts 2Q results - Jul. 19, 1999|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000–2010 ===
In this decade, Pfizer grew by mergers, including those with [[Warner–Lambert]] (2000), [[Pharmacia]] (2003), and [[Wyeth]] (2009).

In 2003, the company acquired [[Esperion Therapeutics]] for $1.3 billion (later selling the unit in 2008), protecting Lipitor from [[ETC-216]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmunos/2015/11/30/pfizer-does-not-need-a-merger-it-needs-a-rebellion/#63d5153e21d6|title=Pfizer Does Not Need A Merger, It Needs A Rebellion|first=Bernard|last=Munos|publisher=|accessdate=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Pfizer announced it would acquire Meridica for $125 million.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2005, the company made a number of acquisitions: Vicuron Pharmaceuticals for $1.9 billion, Idun for just less than $300 million and finally Angiosyn for $527 million.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

On June 26, 2006, Pfizer announced it would sell its Consumer Healthcare unit (manufacturer of [[Listerine]], [[Nicorette]], [[Visine]], [[Sudafed]] and Neosporin) to [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] for $16.6&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/money/archives/articles/2006/6/26/082230.cfm |date=June 26, 2006 |title=Johnson &amp; Johnson to Buy Pfizer Unit |accessdate=July 19, 2007 |publisher=MoneyNews.com }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="investor_dec_2006"&gt;{{cite press release| url = http://www.investor.jnj.com/releaseDetail.cfm?releaseid=223093| title = Johnson &amp; Johnson Completes Acquisition Of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare| publisher=[[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]| date = 20 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_dec_2006"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/27/business/27johnson.html| title = Johnson &amp; Johnson Buys Pfizer Unit for $16.6&amp;nbsp;billion| first=Stephanie | last=Saul| date = 27 June 2006| work=The New York Times |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of [[torcetrapib]], a drug that increases production of [[high density lipoprotein|HDL]], or "good cholesterol", which reduces [[low density lipoprotein|LDL]] thought to be correlated to heart disease, was cancelled in December 2006. During a Phase III clinical trial involving 15,000 patients, more deaths occurred in the group that took the medicine than expected, and a sixty percent increase in mortality was seen among patients taking the combination of torcetrapib and Lipitor versus Lipitor alone. Lipitor alone was not implicated in the results, but Pfizer lost nearly $1&amp;nbsp;billion developing the failed drug and the market value of the company plummeted afterwards.&lt;ref name="NYT_2006"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/health/05pfizer.html?oref=slogin |title=Pfizer Shares Plummet on Loss of a Promising Heart Drug |author1=Berenson, Alex |author2=Pollack, Andrew |date=5 December 2006 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berenson 20061203"&gt;{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Berenson |title=Pfizer Ends Studies on Drug for Heart Disease |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/health/03pfizer.html?_r=1&amp;th&amp;emc=th&amp;oref=slogin |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In September 2009, Pfizer pleaded guilty to the illegal marketing of the arthritis drug [[Valdecoxib#2009 settlement for off-label uses promotions|Bextra]] for uses unapproved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and agreed to a $2.3 billion settlement, the largest health care fraud settlement at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/03/business/03health.html "Pfizer pays $2.3 billion to settle marketing case"], ''The New York Times,'' September 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A July 2010 article in ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|BusinessWeek]]'' reported that Pfizer was seeing more success in its battle against makers of [[counterfeit]] prescription drugs by pursuing civil lawsuits rather than criminal prosecution. Pfizer has hired customs and narcotics experts from all over the globe to track down fakes and assemble evidence that can be used to pursue civil suits for [[trademark infringement]]. Since 2007, Pfizer has spent $3.3&amp;nbsp;million on investigations and legal fees and recovered about $5.1&amp;nbsp;million, with another $5&amp;nbsp;million tied up in ongoing cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennett |first=Simeon |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_29/b4187021988297.htm |title=Pfizer: Civil Suits for Drug Counterfeiters |work=BusinessWeek |date=July 8, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 2013, Pfizer told The [[Associated Press]] it would begin selling Viagra directly to patients via its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pfizer to sell Viagra online, in first for Big Pharma: AP|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-500395_162-57582958/pfizer-to-sell-viagra-online-in-first-for-big-pharma-ap/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warner–Lambert acquisition==
Pfizer acquired [[Warner–Lambert]] in 2000 for $111.8&amp;nbsp;billion,&lt;ref&gt;Pfizer, [http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/pfizer_warner_lambert.jsp 2000: Pfizer joins forces with Warner–Lambert], accessed April 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; at the time, created the second largest pharmaceutical company in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/here-are-the-7-biggest-mergers-of-all-time-2017-5/#6-warner-lambert-warms-up-to-pfizer-89-billion-2|title=Here are the 7 biggest mergers of all time|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner–Lambert was founded as a [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] drug store in 1856 by William R. Warner. Inventing a tablet-coating process gained Warner a place in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. Parke–Davis was founded in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] in 1866 by Hervey Parke and George Davis. Warner–Lambert took over Parke–Davis in 1976, and acquired [[Wilkinson Sword]] in 1993 and Agouron Pharmaceuticals in 1999. 

====Pharmacia acquisition====
In 2002, Pfizer merged with [[Pharmacia]]. The merger was again driven in part by the desire to acquire full rights to a product, this time Celebrex ([[celecoxib]]), the [[COX-2 selective inhibitor]] previously jointly marketed by [[G. D. Searle &amp; Company|Searle]] (acquired by Pharmacia) and Pfizer. In the ensuing years, Pfizer carried out a massive restructuring that resulted in numerous site closures and the loss of jobs including [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]], Indiana; [[Holland, Michigan|Holland]], Michigan; [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]], Connecticut; [[Brooklyn]], New York; [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], UK; and [[Puerto Rico]].

Pharmacia had been formed by a series of mergers and acquisitions from its predecessors, including Searle, [[Upjohn]] and [[SUGEN]].

Searle was founded in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], in April 1888. The founder was Gideon Daniel Searle. In 1908, the company was incorporated in [[Chicago]], Illinois. In 1941, the company established headquarters in Skokie, Illinois. It was acquired by the [[Monsanto Company]], headquartered in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, in 1985.

The Upjohn Company was a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm founded in 1886 in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], by Dr. [[William E. Upjohn]], an 1875 graduate of the [[University of Michigan]] medical school. The company was originally formed to make friable pills, which were specifically designed to be easily digested.  Greenstone was founded in 1993 by Upjohn as a generics division.&lt;ref name=PT2008/&gt; In 1995, Upjohn merged with Pharmacia, to form [[Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn]]. Pharmacia was created in April 2000 through the merger of Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn with the Monsanto Company and its G.D. Searle unit. The merged company was based in Peapack, New Jersey. The agricultural division was spun off from Pharmacia, as Monsanto, in preparation for the close of the acquisition by Pfizer.&lt;ref name="urlPharmacia to Spin Off Monsanto Stake, Less Than 2 Years After Firms Merger Wall Street Journal 28nov01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Industry/Monsanto-Pharmacia-SpinOff.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415082118/http://www.mindfully.org/Industry/Monsanto-Pharmacia-SpinOff.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 15, 2013|title=Pharmacia to spin-off Monsanto stake, less than 2 years after firms' merger|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=mindfully.org|date=November 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SUGEN, a company focused on [[protein kinase]] inhibitors, was founded in 1991 in [[Redwood City, California]], and acquired by [[Pharmacia]] in 1999. The company pioneered the use of ATP-mimetic small molecules to block [[signal transduction]]. After the Pfizer merger, the SUGEN site was shut down in 2003, with the loss of over 300 jobs, and several programs were transferred to Pfizer. These included [[sunitinib]] (Sutent), which was approved for human use by the FDA in January 2006, passed $1&amp;nbsp;billion in annual revenues for Pfizer in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/files/annualreport/2010/financial/financial2010.pdf |title=Pfizer 2010 annual financial review, p 25. |format=PDF |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related compound, SU11654 ([[Toceranib]]), was also approved for [[Cancer in dogs|canine tumors]], and the [[ALK inhibitor]] [[Crizotinib]] also grew out of a SUGEN program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-05/pfizer-drug-targets-gene-flaw-to-shrink-lung-tumors-update1-.html |title=Pfizer Drug Targets Gene Flaw to Shrink Lung Tumors (Update1) |work=Businessweek |accessdate=July 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711122156/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-05/pfizer-drug-targets-gene-flaw-to-shrink-lung-tumors-update1-.html |archivedate=July 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the new Pfizer made Greenstone (originally established as a division of Upjohn) its generic division, and its focus turned to selling [[authorized generics]] of Pfizer's products.&lt;ref name=PT2008&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff|title=Greenstone LLC - A Successful Business Model|url=http://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/supplement/2008/supp_2008-08/supp_2008-08_006|publisher=Pharmacy Times|date=August 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hensley|first1=Scott|title=Pfizer to Make Generic Version of Its Zoloft|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115154467879893805|work=Wall Street Journal|date=29 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Pfizer announced 275 job cuts at the Kalamazoo manufacturing facility. Kalamazoo was previously the world headquarters for the Upjohn Company.&lt;ref name="urlPfizer plant in Michigan to cut 275 - FiercePharma"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/pfizer-plant-michigan-cut-275/2008-07-15 | title = Pfizer plant in Michigan to cut 275 – FiercePharma | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wyeth acquisition====
On January 26, 2009, after more than a year of talks between the two companies, Pfizer agreed to buy pharmaceuticals rival [[Wyeth]] for a combined US$68&amp;nbsp;billion in cash, shares and loans, including some US$22.5&amp;nbsp;billion lent by five major [[Wall Street]] banks. The deal cemented Pfizer's position as the largest pharmaceutical company in the world, with the merged company generating over US$20&amp;nbsp;billion in cash each year, and was the largest corporate merger since [[AT&amp;T]] and [[BellSouth]]'s US$70&amp;nbsp;billion deal in March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/business/26drug.html Pfizer Agrees to Pay $68&amp;nbsp;billion for Rival Drug Maker Wyeth] By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and DUFF WILSON. January 26, 2009. ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The combined company was expected to save US$4&amp;nbsp;billion annually through streamlining; however, as part of the deal, both companies must repatriate billions of dollars in revenue from foreign sources to the United States, which will result in higher tax costs. The acquisition was completed on October 15, 2009, making Wyeth a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.&lt;ref name=PfizerWyeth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/investors/shareholder_services/wyeth_transaction.jsp |title=Wyeth Transaction |publisher=Pfizer |accessdate=October 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019062550/http://www.pfizer.com/investors/shareholder_services/wyeth_transaction.jsp |archivedate=October 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The merger was broadly criticized. [[Harvard Business School]]'s Gary Pisano told [[The Wall Street Journal]], "the record of big mergers and acquisitions in Big Pharma has just not been good. There's just been an enormous amount of shareholder wealth destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://industry.bnet.com/pharma/1000627/the-pfizer-wyeth-deal-worst-case-scenario/ The Pfizer–Wyeth Deal Worst-Case Scenario] By Jim Edwards | January 23, 2009 – BNET&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts said at the time, "The Warner–Lambert and Pharmacia mergers do not appear to have achieved gains for shareholders, so it is unclear who benefits from the Wyeth–Pfizer merger to many critics."&lt;ref name="Matthew"&gt;Matthew Karnitschnig, &amp; Jonathan D. Rockoff. (2009, January 23). Pfizer in Talks to Buy Wyeth. Wall Street Journal (Eastern Edition), p. A.1. Retrieved March 7, 2010, from Wall Street Journal. (Document ID: 1631280041).&lt;/ref&gt;

====King Pharmaceuticals acquisition====
In October 2010, Pfizer agreed to buy [[King Pharmaceuticals]] for $3.6&amp;nbsp;billion in cash or $14.25 per share: an approximately 40% premium over King's closing share price October 11, 2010.&lt;ref name="htanna"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pfizer to buy King Pharma for $3.6&amp;nbsp;billion in cash|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1216434820101012|agency=Reuters |accessdate=October 12, 2010 | date=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011–present===
In February 2011, it was announced that Pfizer was to close its UK research and development facility (formerly also a manufacturing plant) in [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], Kent, which at the time employed 2,400 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12335801 |work=BBC News | title=Pfizer to close UK research site | date=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2014, Pfizer has a reduced presence at the site;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/research/science_and_technology/rd_locations/uk_sandwich|title=Sandwich UK - Pfizer: One of the world's premier biopharmaceutical companies|work=pfizer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also has a UK research unit in [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/research/science_and_technology/rd_locations/uk_cambridge|title=Cambridge, UK|work=pfizer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 4, 2012, the FDA approved a Pfizer pill for a rare type of [[leukemia]]. The medicine, called Bosulif, treats [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] (CML), a blood and [[bone marrow]] disease that usually affects older adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA approves Pfizer leukemia drug |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/04/us-pfizer-leukemia-idUSBRE88314720120904 |publisher= Reuters|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the company announced it would acquire Innopharma for $225&amp;nbsp;million, plus up to $135&amp;nbsp;million in milestone payments, in a deal that expanded Pfizer's range of generic and injectable drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/pfizer-to-acquire-innopharma-for-up-to-360m/81250112/?kwrd=pfizer%20acquire|title=GEN - News Highlights:Pfizer to Acquire InnoPharma for Up to $360M|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempted AstraZeneca acquisition====
In April 2014, it was reported that Pfizer had reignited a $100&amp;nbsp;billion takeover bid for the UK-based [[AstraZeneca]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/28/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-idUSBREA3R0H520140428| title=Pfizer chases AstraZeneca for potential $100 billion deal | author=Ben Hirschler | publisher=Reuters | date=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brozak|first=Steve|title=No Longer King Of The North, Pfizer Looks To Recapture Crown|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenbrozak/2014/04/30/no-longer-king-of-the-north-pfizer-looks-to-recapture-crown/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; sparking political controversy in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27309849 ''Cameron and Miliband clash over Pfizer deal''], BBC News, May 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27344465 ''US politicians raise questions over Pfizer bid''], BBC News, May 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, 2014, a "final offer" of £55 a share was rejected by the AstraZeneca board, which said the bid was too low and imposed too many risks.

====Attempted Allergan acquisition====
{{main article|Allergan, Plc}}
On November 23, 2015, Pfizer and [[Allergan, Plc]] announced their intention to merge for an approximate sum of $160&amp;nbsp;billion, making it the largest pharmaceutical deal ever, and the third largest corporate merger in history. As part of the deal, the Pfizer CEO, Ian Read, was to remain as CEO and chairman of the new company, to be called "Pfizer plc", with Allergan's CEO, Brent Saunders, becoming president and chief operating officer. As part of the deal, Allergan shareholders would receive 11.3 shares of the company, with Pfizer shareholders receiving one. The terms proposed that the merged company would maintain Allergan's [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] domicile, resulting in the new company being subject to [[corporation tax]] at the Irish rate of 12.5%--considerably lower than the 35% rate that Pfizer paid at the time.&lt;ref name="BBC_23_nov_2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34900344|title=Pfizer seals $160bn Allergan deal to create drugs giant|work=BBC News |accessdate=24 November 2015 |date=23 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was to constitute a [[reverse merger]], whereby Allergan acquired Pfizer, with the new company then changing its name to "Pfizer, plc".&lt;ref name="Genegnews_2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/pfizer-to-acquire-allergan-for-160b/81252011/|title=Pfizer to Acquire Allergan for $160B|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg_22_Nov_2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-22/pfizer-allergan-said-to-be-close-to-150-billion-merger|title=Pfizer and Allergan to Combine With Joint Value of $160 Billion|author=Cynthia Koons|date=November 22, 2015|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="premier_2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premierbiopharmaleader.com/en/media/press-releases/pfizer-and-allergan-to-combine/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20151123173226/http://www.premierbiopharmaleader.com/en/media/press-releases/pfizer-and-allergan-to-combine/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-11-23|title=Disclaimer - PremierBiopharmaLeader|work=premierbiopharmaleader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was expected to be completed in the second half of 2016, subject to certain conditions: US and EU approval, approval from both sets of shareholders, and the completion of Allergan's divestiture of its generics division to [[Teva Pharmaceuticals]] (expected in the first quarter of 2016).&lt;ref name="Genegnews_2015"/&gt; On April 6, 2016, Pfizer and Allergan announced they would be calling off the merger after the Obama administration introduced new laws intended to limit [[corporate inversion|corporate tax inversions]] (the extent to which companies could move their headquarters overseas in order to reduce the amount of taxes they pay).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/business/dealbook/pfizer-allergan-merger.html?_r=0 | title=Pfizer and Allergan Call Off Merger After Tax-Rule Changes | work=New York Times | date=6 April 2016 | accessdate=6 April 2016 | author=Bray, Chad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pfizer Consumer Healthcare====
In October 2017, reports emerged that Pfizer were undertaking a strategic review of their Consumer Healthcare division, with possible results ranging from a partial or complete spin-off or a direct sale&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer_reviewing_strategic_alternatives_for_consumer_healthcare_business&lt;/ref&gt; with the divestment expected to raise in the region of $15 billion for one of the largest Over-the-Counter businesses in the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pfizer-divestiture-exclusive/exclusive-pfizer-to-launch-consumer-health-sale-in-november-sources-idUSKBN1CU2RW&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reckitt Benckiser]] expressed interest in bidding for the division earlier in October&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/reckitt-benckiser-s-still-keen-a-pfizer-otc-buy-but-can-it-afford-one&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Sanofi]], [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/glaxosmithkline-s-eyeing-pfizer-s-otc-unit-but-will-a-buy-imperil-its-dividend&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] also being linked with bids for the business.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/sanofi-j-j-could-join-gsk-reckitt-20b-bidding-war-for-pfizer-otc-report&lt;/ref&gt; On March 22, Reckitt Benckiser pulled out of the deal, a day later GlaxoSmithKline also pulled out.&lt;ref&gt;https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-pfizer-divestiture-glaxosmithkline/gsk-pulls-out-of-20-billion-race-for-pfizer-consumer-assets-idUKKBN1GZ0WG&lt;/ref&gt;

Key current and historical Pfizer products include:

* [[Atorvastatin]] ([[Drug nomenclature#Publication policies for nonproprietary and proprietary names|trade name]] Lipitor), a [[statin]] for the treatment of [[hypercholesterolemia]]. Lipitor was developed by Pfizer legacy company Warner-Lambert and first marketed in 1996.&lt;ref name="FDA_Lipitor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.DrugDetails |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although atorvastatin was the fifth drug in the class of [[statins]] to be developed, clinical trials showed that atorvastatin caused a more dramatic reduction in [[LDL-C]] than the other statin drugs. From 1996 to 2012 under the trade name Lipitor, atorvastatin became the world's best-selling drug of all time, with more than $125 billion in sales over approximately 14.5 years.&lt;ref name="url_Crain_2011" /&gt; Lipitor alone "provided up to a quarter of Pfizer Inc.'s annual revenue for years."&lt;ref name="url_Crain_2011"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20111228/HEALTH_CARE/111229902 | title = Lipitor becomes world's top-selling drug | date = 28 December 2011 | publisher = Crain's New York Business via Associated Press |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Prevnar]] (13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine) is a vaccine for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal infections. The introduction of the original, 7-valent version of the vaccine in 1999 led to a 75% reduction in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal infections among children under age 5 in the United States. An improved version of the vaccine, providing coverage of 13 bacterial variants, was introduced in early 2010. As of 2012 the rate of invasive infections among children under age 5 has been reduced by an additional 50%.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt;
* [[Norvasc]] (amlodipine), an [[antihypertensive]] drug of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker class. Amlodipine is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], a list of the most important medication needed in a basic [[health system]].&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court filings show that a research agreement was made with [[Monsanto]], whose pharmaceutical business was later acquired by Pfizer, to develop a better aspirin. The enzyme that Dr. Simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems, which Celebrex is used to reduce those issues. A battle ensued, lasting over six years, because BYU claimed that Pfizer did not give him credit or compensation while Pfizer claims it had met all obligations regarding the Monsanto agreement. This culminated in a $450 million amicable settlement without going to trial. Pfizer said it would take a $450 million charge against first quarter earnings to settle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/health/pfizer-settles-lawsuit-involving-1429314.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601055014/http://www.ajc.com/health/pfizer-settles-lawsuit-involving-1429314.html|date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation in which Pfizer was not a party===
Pfizer was discussed as part of the [[Kelo v. New London]] case that was decided by [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 2005.  In February 1998 Pfzer announced it would build a research facility in  [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], Connecticut, and local planners, hoping to promote [[economic development]] and build on the influx of jobs the planned facility would bring to the town, created a plan that included seizing property to redevelop it under [[eminent domain]], and local residents sued to stop the seizure.  The case went to the Supreme Court, and with regard to Pfizer, the court cited a prior decision that said: "The record clearly demonstrates that the development plan was not intended to serve the interests of Pfizer, Inc., or any other private entity, but rather, to revitalize the local economy by creating temporary and permanent jobs, generating a significant increase in tax revenue, encouraging spin-off economic activities and maximizing public access to the waterfront”.&lt;ref name=Kelo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-108.ZO.html|title=Kelo V.

==Environmental record==
Between 2002 and 2008, Pfizer reduced its greenhouse emissions by 20%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/press-releases/pfizer-commended-leadership-addressing-climate-change-third-consecutive-year |title=Pfizer Commended For Leadership In Addressing Climate Change For Third Consecutive Year - FierceBiotech |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and committed to reducing emissions by an additional 20% by 2012. In 2012 the company was named to the [[Carbon Disclosure Project]]'s Carbon Leadership Index in recognition of its efforts to reduced greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-archive-detail/pfizer_recognized_by_carbon_disclosure_project_for_carbon_performance |title=Pfizer Recognized by Carbon Disclosure Project for Carbon Performance &amp;#124; Pfizer: One of the world’s premiere biopharmaceutical companies |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pfizer has inherited Wyeth's liabilities in the [[American Cyanamid]] site in Bridgewater, New Jersey. This site is highly toxic and an EPA declared Superfund site. Pfizer has since attempted to remediate this land in order to clean and develop it for future profits and potential public uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.gov/dep/srp/community/sites/pi/american_cyanamid_fs.pdf|title=American Cyanamid Superfund Site|date=December 2011|work=The State of New Jersey|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sierra Club and the Edison Wetlands Association have come out in opposition to the cleanup plan, arguing that the area is subject to flooding, which could cause pollutants to leach. The EPA considers the plan the most reasonable from considerations of safety and cost-effectiveness, arguing that an alternative plan involving trucking contaminated soil off site could expose cleanup workers. The EPA's position is backed by the environmental watchdog group CRISIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/activisits_say_epa_fix_for_pol.html |title=Activists say EPA $204M fix for polluted American Cyanamid property will not permanently resolve problem &amp;#124; NJ.com |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2002, a chemical explosion at the Groton plant injured seven people and caused the evacuation of over 100 homes in the surrounding area.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/23/AR2006052301305_pf.html The tempest]. ''[[The Washington Post]]''. May 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political lobbying==
Pfizer is a leading member of the [[U.S. Global Leadership Coalition]], a Washington D.C.-based coalition of over 400 major companies and NGOs that advocates for a larger International Affairs Budget, which funds American diplomatic, humanitarian, and development efforts abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usglc.org/about/our-coalition |title=U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, Global Trust members |publisher=Usglc.org |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pfizer is one of the single largest lobbying interests in United States politics. For example, in the first 9 months of 2009 Pfizer spent over $16.3&amp;nbsp;million on lobbying US congressional lawmakers, making them the sixth largest lobbying interest in the US (following Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which ranked fourth but also represents many of their interests). A spokeswoman for Pfizer said the company “wanted to make sure our voice is heard in this conversation” in regards to the company's expenditure of $25&amp;nbsp;million in 2010 to lobby health care reform.&lt;ref&gt;Steinbrook, R., 2009. [http://healthcarereform.nejm.org/?p=2358 Lobbying, Campaign Contributions, and Health Care Reform] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610045933/http://healthcarereform.nejm.org/?p=2358 |date=June 10, 2010 }}  New England Journal of Medicine. 361(23), e52–e52.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] cables released by the [[whistleblower]] site [[WikiLeaks]], Pfizer "lobbied against New Zealand getting a [[free trade]] agreement with the United States because it objected to New Zealand’s restrictive drug buying rules and tried to get rid of New Zealand’s former health minister, [[Helen Clark]], in 1990.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10695239"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/pharmaceuticals/news/article.cfm?c_id=278&amp;objectid=10695239 |title= WikiLeaks: Drug firms tried to ditch Clark |author1=David Fisher  |author2=Jonathan Milne  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=December 19, 2010 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment and diversity==
Since 2004, Pfizer has received a 100% rating every year on the [[Corporate Equality Index]], released by the [[Human Rights Campaign|Human Rights Campaign Foundation]].

In 2012, Pfizer's Canadian division, which then employed 2,890 people, was named one of [[Canada's Top 100 Employers#Montreal Top 15 Winners|Montreal's Top 15 Employers]], the only research-based pharmaceutical company to receive this honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadastop100.com/montreal/montreal2012.pdf|title=Montreal's Top Employers 2012|date=2012|publisher=Canada's Top 100|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417084851/http://www.canadastop100.com/montreal/montreal2012.pdf|archivedate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in developing world health issues==
Pfizer makes the anti-fungal drug [[fluconazole]] available free of charge to governmental and [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) in [[developing country|developing countries]] with a greater than 1% prevalence of [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/07/world/aids-fungus-drug-offered-to-poor-nations.html | title=AIDS Fungus Drug Offered to Poor Nations | date=June 7, 2001 | accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww4.aegis.org/news/re/2001/RE010226.html|title=S.Africa okays Pfizer AIDS drug distribution|publisher=Reuters NewMedia|date=February 21, 2001|first=Emelia|last=Sithole|accessdate=May 15, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091937/http://ww4.aegis.org/news/re/2001/RE010226.html|archive-date=September 29, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pfizer.com/responsibility/global_health/diflucan_partnership_program |title=Pfizer - Diflucan Commitments |accessdate=2014-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has also pledged to provide up to 740&amp;nbsp;million doses of its anti-[[pneumococcal infection|pneumococcal]] vaccine at discounted rates to infants and young children in 41 developing countries in association with the [[GAVI Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pfizer.com/health/vaccines/developing_world |title=Pfizer - GAVI commitments |accessdate=2014-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Pfizer and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]] announced a joint effort to provide affordable access to Pfizer's long-lasting injectable contraceptive, [[Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate|medroxyprogesterone acetate]], to three million women in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/media-center/press-releases/2012/07/innovative-partnership-to-deliver-convenient-contraceptives-to-up-to-three-million-women |title=Pfizer Gates Foundation Press Release |accessdate=2014-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Planet of the Apps''''' is an American [[Reality television#Documentary-style|reality television show]] broadcast on [[Apple Music]]. It is the first original television show produced by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]. On July 23, 2018, it was announced that Apple had canceled the series after one season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clover |first1=Juli |title='Planet of the Apps' Star Gary Vaynerchuk Blames Show's Failure on Apple's Poor Marketing |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2018/07/23/planet-of-the-apps-gary-vaynerchuk/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |accessdate=July 24, 2018 |language=en |date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episode style==
On each of the episode, [[software]] makers have 60 seconds to pitch their idea in front of the judges ([[Jessica Alba]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[will.i.am]] and [[Gary Vaynerchuk]]) on a slow-moving [[escalator]]—for a visual idea of an "[[elevator pitch]]". New episodes were released on Tuesdays, with the first season being 10 episodes long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-television-apps-idUSKBN18X32P |title=Apple's first TV series shows what it takes to build an app |date=2017-06-09 |agency=Reuters|access-date=2017-06-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614132324/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-television-apps-idUSKBN18X32P |archivedate=2017-06-14 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is hosted by [[Zane Lowe]] and produced by [[Ben Silverman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/reviews/planet-of-the-apps-apple-gwyneth-paltrow-jessica-alba-1202456477/ |title=TV Review: Apple’s ‘Planet of the Apps’ |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |date=2017-06-07 |work=Variety|access-date=2017-06-15  |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619204025/http://variety.com/2017/tv/reviews/planet-of-the-apps-apple-gwyneth-paltrow-jessica-alba-1202456477/ |archivedate=2017-06-19 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series premiered on June 6, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/06/apple-music-planet-of-the-apps-premiere/ |title=Apple Music's 'Planet of the Apps' reality show debuts tonight |website=Engadget|access-date=2017-06-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613022419/https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/06/apple-music-planet-of-the-apps-premiere/ |archivedate=2017-06-13 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/07/apples-debut-tv-series-planet-of-the-apps-kicks-off/ |title=Apple’s debut TV series, Planet of the Apps, kicks off |last=Lomas |first=Natasha |publisher=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-06-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613105648/https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/07/apples-debut-tv-series-planet-of-the-apps-kicks-off/ |archivedate=2017-06-13 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7751">{{Economic systems sidebar|coordination}}
In [[economics]], a '''price system''' is a component of any [[economic]] system that uses [[prices]] expressed in any form of [[money]] for the [[Economic value|valuation]] and distribution of goods and services and the [[factors of production]]. Except for possible remote and primitive communities, all modern societies use price systems to allocate resources, although price systems are not used exclusively for all resource allocation decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/475822/price-system | title = Price system | author = [[George J. Stigler]], [[William J. Baumol]] | work = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | accessdate =2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A price system may be either a [[regulated market|fixed price system]] where [[Administered price|prices are administered]] by a government body, or it may be a [[free price system]] where prices are left to float "freely" as determined by supply and demand uninhibited by regulations. A mixed price system involves a combination of both administered and unregulated prices.

== History ==
Price systems have been around as long as there has been [[money]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} 

The price system has evolved into the system of global [[capitalism]] that is present in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110728152736/http://www.technocracy.org/archives/185-langan I Am The Price System R. B. Langan Great lakes Technocrat  April 1944, # 66.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union and other [[Communist state]]s with a centralized [[planned economy]] maintained controlled price systems. Whether the ruble or the dollar is used in the economic system, the criterion of a price system is the use of money as an arbiter and usual final arbiter of whether a thing is done or not. In other words, few things are done without consideration for the monetary costs and the potential making of a profit in a price system.

=== Debate on socialism ===
{{See also|Socialist calculation debate}}
The American economist [[Thorstein Veblen]] wrote a seminal tract on the development of the term as discussed in this article: ''The Engineers and the Price System''.&lt;ref&gt;Harbinger Edition, 1963. LCCCN 63-19639. First Published as a series of essays in [[The Dial]] (1919) then as a book in 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Veblen/Papers/Engineers.htm Full Text (HTML)]&lt;/ref&gt; Its chapter VI, ''A Memorandum on a Practicable Soviet of Technicians'' discusses the possibility of [[socialist]] revolution in the United States comparable to that then occurring in Russia (the Soviets had not yet at that time become a state (USSR formed in 1922)).

The original conception of socialism involved the substitution of money as a unit of calculation and monetary prices as a whole with [[calculation in kind]] (or valuation based on natural units), with business and financial decisions replaced by engineering and technical criteria for managing the economy. Fundamentally, this meant that socialism would operate under different economic dynamics than those of capitalism and the price system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bockman|first= Johanna |title= Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism|publisher= Stanford University Press|year= 2011|month= |isbn= 978-0-8047-7566-3|page = 20|quote= According to nineteenth-century socialist views, socialism would function without capitalist economic categories - such as money, prices, interest, profits and rent - and thus would function according to laws other than those described by current economic science. While some socialists recognized the need for money and prices at least during the transition from capitalism to socialism, socialists more commonly believed that the socialist economy would soon administratively mobilize the economy in physical units without the use of prices or money.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1930s, the economists [[Oskar Lange]] and [[Abba Lerner]] developed a comprehensive model of a socialist economy that utilized a price system and money for the allocation of [[capital good]]s. In contrast to a free-market price system, "socialist" prices would be set by a planning board to equal the [[marginal cost]] of production to achieve [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] Pareto efficiency. Because this model of socialism relied upon money and administered prices as opposed to non-monetary calculation in physical magnitudes, it was labelled "market socialism". In effect, Oskar Lange conceded that calculations in a socialist system would have to be performed in value terms with a functioning price system rather than using purely natural or engineering criteria as in the classic concept of socialism.&lt;ref name="Revisiting the Socialist Calculation Debate"&gt;''Revisiting the Socialist Calculation Debate: The role of markets and finance in Hayek's response to Lange's challenge'', by Auerbach, Paul and Sotiropoulos, Dimitris. 2012. Kingston University London, Economics Discussion Paper 2012-6, pp. 1-2: "He readily acceded to the need for efficiency calculations to be made in value terms rather than using purely natural or engineering criteria, but claimed that these values could emerge along lines consistent with neoclassical value theory, without the need for a market in capital goods and without private ownership over the means of production."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hayek===
{{details|Price signal}}
[[Austrian School]] economist [[Friedrich Hayek]] argued that a free price system allowed economic coordination via the [[price signal]]s that changing prices send, which is regarded as one of his most significant and influential contributions to economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Skarbek | first = David | title = F. A. Hayek's Influence on Nobel Prize Winners | journal = [[Review of Austrian Economics]] | volume = 22 | number = 1 | date = March 2009 | url = http://www.davidskarbek.com/papers/HayekNobel.pdf }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[The Use of Knowledge in Society]]" (1945), Hayek wrote, "The price system is just one of those formations which man has learned to use (though he is still very far from having learned to make the best use of it) after he had stumbled upon it without understanding it. Through it not only a [[division of labor]] but also a coördinated utilization of resources based on an equally divided knowledge has become possible. The people who like to deride any suggestion that this may be so usually distort the argument by insinuating that it asserts that by some miracle just that sort of system has spontaneously grown up which is best suited to modern civilization. It is the other way round: man has been able to develop that division of labor on which our civilization is based because he happened to stumble upon a method which made it possible. Had he not done so, he might still have developed some other, altogether different, type of civilization, something like the "state" of the termite ants, or some other altogether unimaginable type."&lt;ref name="Hayek45"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.kysq.org/docs/Hayek_45.pdf |author=[[Friedrich Hayek]] |title=The Use of Knowledge in Society |date=September 1945 |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=35 |number=4 |page=528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6518">'''Rapid Results''' is a structured process that mobilizes teams to achieve tangible results over a rapid time frame and accelerate organizational learning. [http://www.schafferresults.com Schaffer Consulting], a [[management consulting]] firm headquartered in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], developed the Rapid Results approach based on their experience working with clients across industries to achieve breakthrough levels of performance. The approach and its practitioners have since been recognized in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', and ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', among other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Tina|title=Making Change Happen, on a Deadline|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/making-change-happen-on-a-deadline/|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schaffer|first1=Robert|title=Demand Better Results - And Get Them|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=1 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foreign Policy"&gt;{{cite web|title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers 2012|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/26/the_fp_100_global_thinkers?page=0,24#thinker25|publisher=Foreign Policy Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Schaffer Consulting founded the [[Rapid Results Institute]] (RRI) to refine the methodology to support non-profit work and development projects across Sub-Saharan Africa, South America, the United States, and the Middle East.

== Methodology ==

The objective of Rapid Results initiatives is to achieve dramatic results, formed under the pressure of short time frames and ambitious targets.&lt;ref name="Global Health 101"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skolnik|first=Richard|title=Global Health 101|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|location=Burlington, MA|isbn=0763797510|pages=174–175|url=https://books.google.com.lb/books?id=sBQRpj4uWmYC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=(Rapid+Results+Institute+and+Micronutrient+Initiative+2008&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VVnQliS5--&amp;sig=BETcx2RH6JJeZYfP53x_EG6_1Ag&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4-QkUfiZMIm70QXqp4CgDw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=rapid%20results%20institute&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid Results initiatives begin with a call to action for significant performance improvement delivered by a single leader or group of leaders to cross-functional teams of 8-10 people. Team members then set and commit to "seemingly unreasonable" short-term goals — often in 100 days or less — tied to the strategic imperatives outlined by their leaders. Teams then experiment with new ways of working, capturing learnings along the way, and persisting until they achieve desired outcomes. Rapid Results aims to stimulate innovation, collaboration, and more effective execution in and across organizations and stakeholder groups. Leaders leverage initial results to create longer-term and wider-scale impact in subsequent waves of Rapid Results projects.&lt;ref name="Managing Human Resources"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson|author2=Ones|author3=Dilchert|title=Managing Human Resources for Environmental Sustainability|year=2012|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=319–340|url=https://books.google.com.lb/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UBBeYc1rCu0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA319&amp;dq=%22Rapid+Results+Institute%22&amp;ots=pQjY2tyTeS&amp;sig=W1Pq8GqOGTk3ntqQjeKeF8H7H2c&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rapid%20Results%20Institute%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business impact ==

Leaders in many industries leverage Rapid Results to achieve performance goals, including accelerating growth, increasing productivity, and realizing cost savings.

Lynn Chambers, group head of Talent at the London Stock Exchange Group, says, “This approach can be taken to accelerate progress on almost any goal.” Dean Scarborough, president and chief executive officer of Avery Dennison describes Rapid Results “driving an incredible amount of creativity” among team members. Martha Marsh, former president and CEO of Stanford Hospital and Clinics, observes that Rapid Results “provide an intense focus on getting results, while helping build the capacity of our organization to drive transformational change.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schaffer|first1=Robert|last2=Ashkenas|first2=Ron|title=Rapid Results! How 100-Day Projects Build the Capacity for Large-Scale Change|date=2005|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rapid Results Institute ==

Formed in 2007, the Rapid Results Institute works with a broad range of partners — including government agencies, not-for-profit organizations, and international development agencies — across a wide spectrum of development initiatives. Past and ongoing projects include H.I.V. prevention in [[Eritrea]] and [[Ethiopia]], public sector reform in [[Kenya]], waste management in [[Brazil]], and housing [[homeless veterans in the United States]].

The Rapid Results Institute is partnering with the 100,000 Homes Campaign and the [[US Department of Veterans Affairs]] to house homeless veterans across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Tina|title=Teaming Up to End Homelessness|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/whe-one-fix-leads-to-another/|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development impact ==

Following a project on [[HIV/AIDS]] awareness among youth, Eritrean Minister of Education Osman Saleh called the Rapid Results approach "a new movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valerio|first1=Alexandria|title=Education and HIV/AIDS: A Sourcebook of HIV/AIDS Prevention Programs|date=2008|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780821374405|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kenya]], an independent evaluation by the AIDS Research and Treatment journal reported that “significant improvement in PMTCT [prevention of mother-to-child-transmission] services can be achieved through introduction of an RRI [Rapid Results Initiative], which appears to lead to sustained benefits for pregnant HIV-infected women and their infants.”

Due to its success in a variety of contexts, the Rapid Results approach has been adopted by the [[World Bank]], as well as by many Kenyan government ministries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers 2012|journal=Foreign Policy Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Schaefer''' is a Swiss [[professional boxing]] promoter. He was the former CEO of [[Golden Boy Promotions]], which he left in 2014.
[[File:Richard Schaefer.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Schaefer at the press conference for the fight between [[Victor Ortiz vs. Floyd Mayweather|Victor Ortiz and Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]]]] In 2016 he founded his own boxing promotional company Ringstar Sports.

==Biography==
Schaefer grew up in [[Switzerland]]. He is a Swiss national who began his career in 1983 at Swiss Volksbank (now [[Credit Suisse]]). Upon graduation from the Swiss Banking School, a division of the [[Swiss Finance Institute]], he became manager of the Swiss Bank office in Los Angeles in 1994. Two years later, Swiss Bank took over UBS (the largest bank in Switzerland). The surviving entity was UBS.  Schaefer was placed in charge of operations for the western United States. In 1997, he was named deputy CEO of all UBS private banking operations in the United States. At the time, UBS oversaw two trillion dollars in assets with private banking at the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hauser|first=Thomas|title=Richard Schaefer and The Golden Boy Empire|url=http://www.secondsout.com/usa-boxing-news/usa-boxing-news/richard-schaefer-and-the-golden-boy-empire|publisher=USA Boxing News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He stunned his wife and three kids and gave up banking in 2000 to join [[Oscar De La Hoya]]'s fledgling business organization, to help the young boxer "build up a business empire." Schaefer first focused on the business of managing fighters, but soon switched tracks to the more lucrative event promotion business, lining up deals for the several major boxing matches for the past 15 years.

More recently, Schaefer has branched out into real estate. Schaefer has other links to [[Hispanic culture]] as well: His wife is from [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/banking-finance/banking-finance-overview/5844651-1.html|title=Swiss ringer: Richard Schaefer broke with his banking background to become Oscar De La Hoya's businesspartner.|last=Howard|first=Fine|date=|work=|publisher=All Business|accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Schaefer founded his own boxing promotional company called Ringstar Sports. Schaefer announced the [[World Boxing Super Series]] in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/sports/boxing/la-sp-sn-world-boxing-super-series-richard-schaefer-20170309-story.html New World Boxing Super Series aims to stage two weight-class tournaments] - Lance Pugmire, Los Angeles Times, 9 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/18868583/world-boxing-super-series-tournament-offer-50-million-prize-money World Boxing Super Series to offer $50 million in prize money] - Dan Rafael, ESPN, 10 March 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sergio Zyman''' (born July 30, 1945) is a [[marketing]] executive from Mexico best known as the marketer behind the failed launch of [[New Coke]], now regarded as one of the greatest marketing blunders of all time.

==New Coke==
A cover story in [[Fortune Magazine]] from May 1, 1995 referred to [[New Coke]] as the biggest marketing blunder since the launch of [[Ford]]'s [[Edsel]].  [[New Coke]] was a reformulation of the original [[Coca-Cola]] flavor. After significant consumer opposition, the original flavor was reintroduced after  77 days. 

''Fortune Magazine'' reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Zyman, then head of U.S. marketing, was coming off his enormously successful introduction of diet Coke when he was assigned day-to-day responsibility for top-secret Project Kansas in 1984. The zealous Mexican insisted that Coca-Cola (or Co-Coola, as he pronounces it) must act boldly to reverse its 20-year market-share decline vs. Pepsi. Zyman, a former Pepsi marketer, argued that the correct strategy was to replace 98-year-old Coke with a better-tasting cola, label it [[New Coke]]," and blare the news--which is exactly what the company did one decade ago this April. Zyman's greatest error, which some attribute to ego, was that he and his team failed to present the option of keeping old Coke on the market.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Career==
Zyman's work experience includes tenures with [[Coca-Cola]], [[PepsiCo]], and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], and his own firm Zyman Group. He is also known for helping introduce [[Diet Coke]] in 1982 and conceiving [[Fruitopia]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/05/01/202473/index.htm |title=SO YOU FAIL.

After leaving the Coca-Cola Company, Zyman launched a [[consulting]] firm called the Zyman Group, which he sold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111239734276795869?mod=googlewsj |title=MDC Takes Majority Stake In Sergio Zyman's Firm - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2005-04-01 |accessdate=2010-06-02 | first=Suzanne | last=Vranica}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[MDC Partners]] Inc., a Canadian advertising firm [[holding company]], for around $60 million in April 2005. He was replaced there as Chairman by Scott Miller, formerly with [[McCann Erickson]]. The Zyman Group is no longer in business. 

Sergio Zyman was most recently a director of Upstream Worldwide, the [[parent company]] of [[uSell.com]], but he has been replaced there and is no longer on the Executive Team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usell.com/about.htm#Team Team]&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with [[JC Penney]] as a Marketing Consultant, but was fired by Chief Operating Officer Mike Ullman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bloomberg News]].  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-09/ackman-calls-for-ouster-of-j-c-penney-chairman.html Ackman calls for ouster of JC Penney chairman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Sergio Zyman is of Mexican [[Jewish]] heritage and is originally a native of [[Mexico City]]. He attended executive programs at [[Harvard University]] and graduate schools in London, Paris and Jerusalem though his professional resume does not list a graduate degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigspeak.com/sergio-zyman.html |title=Sergio Zyman: Coca Cola CMO |publisher=Bigspeak.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==
Zyman has written four books  on   marketing and advertising, including:
*''The End of Advertising as We Know It'' with Armin Brott. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002
*''The End of Marketing as We Know It''

'''Sir John Traill Cargill, 1st Baronet''', [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]], [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] (10 January 1867 – 24 January 1954) was a Scottish oil magnate.

Cargill was born in [[Glasgow]], the second son of [[David Sime Cargill]], founder of the [[Burmah Oil Company]], and his first wife Margaret (née Traill), who died when he was five.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He was educated at [[Glasgow Academy]] from 1878 to 1883, and in 1890 went to [[Burma]] to work in the [[Rangoon]] office of his father's company, returning to Glasgow three years later. In 1904, he succeeded his father as chairman of the company, remaining in the post until 1943. He was also chairman of [[Scottish Oils Ltd]] from 1922 to 1943. He largely served as figurehead of these companies, leaving the real running of them to their [[managing director]]s.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;Biography, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a director of the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] and the [[Assam Oil Company]].&lt;ref name="ww"&gt;Biography, ''[[Who Was Who]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Cargill was created a [[baronet]], of [[Glasgow]], in the [[1920 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31712 |date=30 December 1919 |page=2 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31830 |date=10 March 1920 |page=3432}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of Glasgow and a member of the court of the [[University of Glasgow]], which awarded him an honorary [[Doctorate of Laws]] (LLD) in 1929.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

In 1895, he married Mary Hope Walker Grierson, sister of [[James Moncrieff Grierson|Lieutenant-General Sir James Moncrieff Grierson]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; They had a daughter, Allison Hope Cargill (born 13 August 1896), but no sons, and the baronetcy became extinct upon Cargill's death. His wife died in 1929 and in 1943 he retired to a nursing home in [[Edinburgh]], where he died. He was buried in [[Hillfoot Cemetery]] in Glasgow. He left large benefactions to the University of Glasgow and the [[University of Rangoon]].&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

'''SmartStax''' is a brand of [[Genetically modified plant|genetically modified]] seed made through a collaboration between [[Monsanto Company]] and [[Dow Chemical Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dowagro.com/newsroom/corporatenews/2007/20070914a.htm |accessdate=September 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525030040/http://www.dowagro.com/newsroom/corporatenews/2007/20070914a.htm |archivedate=May 25, 2009 |title=Monsanto, Dow Agreement Paves the Way for Industry's First-Ever, Eight-Gene Stacked Offering in Corn}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes advantage of multiple modes of insect protection and herbicide tolerance. SmartStax takes advantage of [[Yieldgard VT]] Triple (Monsanto), Herculex Xtra (Dow), RoundUp Ready 2 (Monsanto), and Liberty Link (Dow). The traits included protect against above-ground insects, below-ground insects, and provide broad herbicide tolerance.  It is currently available for [[maize|corn]], but [[cotton]], [[soybean]], and specialty crop variations are to be released. Previously, the most genes artificially added to a single plant was three, but Smartstax includes eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/smartstax-maize-germany-approval-428/|title=Monsanto’s SmartStax maize ‘to be approved for growth in October’ in EU|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smartstax also incorporates Monsanto's [[Acceleron Seed Treatment System]] which protects against insects at the earliest stages of development.  Smartstax is sold under the [[Genuity (Monsanto brand)|Genuity]] (Monsanto) and [[Mycogen Seeds|Mycogen]] (Dow) brands.

==Insect Spectrum==
SmartStax seeds control a broad spectrum of pests which includes larvae of above-ground insects such as European corn borer, black cutworm, southwestern corn borer, corn earworm, fall armyworm, western bean cutworm, and below-ground feeding larvae of western corn rootworm and northern corn rootworm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dowagro.com/en-us/usag/product-solution-finder/traits/smartstax|title=Dow AgroSciences SmartStax}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refuge acres==
To prevent or delay insect resistance, growers plant a refuge on their farm. This is an area of non-GM plants where insect can live. These insect will not evolve resistance to GM technology. These refuge acres ensure that rare resistant insects that feed on insect-protected varieties of corn will mate with susceptible insects and slow the development of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cropwatch.unl.edu/corn-growers-reminded-follow-refuge-requirements-spring-planting-nears|title= Corn Growers Reminded to Follow Refuge Requirements as Spring Planting Nears|date=6 March 2009|author=Rob Korff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion and branding==
Smartstax corn has been advertised and promoted on television, at farm trade shows, and online as Monsanto has geared up for widespread commercial release. Smartstax is sold under the Genuity Brand by Monsanto and the Mycogen brand by Dow, but both companies have the right to sell it under as many names with as many additional technologies as they wish.

==Weed and insect resistance==
Recently, rapid emergence of weeds thought to be resistant to [[roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]] have been observed. [[Conyza|Horseweed]], [[giant ragweed]] and [[amaranth|pigweed]], among others have been found growing with crops across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/invasion-of-the-superweeds/?ref=energy-environment | work =New York Times | title = Invasion of the Superweeds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12804 | publisher = The National Academies | title = GE Crops Benefit Farmers, But Management Needed to Maintain Effectiveness}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/business/energy-environment/04weed.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all | title = Farmers Cope With Roundup-Resistant Weeds | publisher = New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Insects including [[western corn rootworm|corn rootworm]] and [[bollworm]] have also begun showing signs of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21829470 | year = 2011 | last1 = Gassmann | first1 = AJ | last2 = Petzold-Maxwell | first2 = JL | last3 = Keweshan | first3 = RS | last4 = Dunbar | first4 = MW | title = Field-evolved resistance to Bt maize by western corn rootworm | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = e22629 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022629 | pmc = 3146474 | journal = PLOS ONE | editor1-last = Meyer | editor1-first = Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120605102846.htm | title = Bigger Refuges Needed to Delay Pest Resistance to Biotech Corn | publisher = Science Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080207140803.htm| publisher = Science Daily | title = First Documented Case Of Pest Resistance To Biotech Cotton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2011/12/05/143141300/insects-find-crack-in-biotech-corns-armor | title = Insects Find Crack In Biotech Corn's Armor | publisher = NPR Food Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Monsanto has continued to develop new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101118084429.htm | publisher = Science Daily | title = New Disease-Resistant Food Crops Under Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2011/08/monsanto-gm-super-insects | title = Attack of the Monsanto Superinsects | publisher = Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[USDA]] approves use of [[Bacillus thuringiensis#Use of Bt genes in genetic engineering of plants for pest control|Bt crops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data/biotechcrops/adoption.htm |title=Adoption of Genetically Engineered Crops in the U.S.: Extent of Adoption |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610043433/http://www.ers.usda.gov/data/biotechcrops/adoption.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto has denied there is a problem with their product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.motherjones.com/files/epa-hq-opp-2011-0922-0003.pdf| title = Memorandum | publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32753">'''Antoin "Tony" Rezko''' (born 1955) is an American businessman.  He was a fundraiser for Illinois [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians. After becoming a major contributor to [[Rod Blagojevich]]'s successful gubernatorial election, Rezko assisted Blagojevich in setting up the state's first Democratic administration in twenty years and as a result he was able to have business associates appointed onto several state boards. Rezko and several others were indicted on federal charges in October 2006 for using their connections on the state boards to demand [[Political corruption#Kickbacks|kickbacks]] from businesses that wished to engage in dealings with the state. While the others pleaded guilty, Rezko pleaded not guilty and was tried.  He was found guilty of 16 of the 24 charges filed against him and on November 23, 2011, he was sentenced to 10.5 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://posttrib.suntimes.com/news/politics/9001435-418/tony-rezko-sentenced-to-10-12-years-in-kickback-scheme.html|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=2012-01-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129212145/http://posttrib.suntimes.com/news/politics/9001435-418/tony-rezko-sentenced-to-10-12-years-in-kickback-scheme.html|archivedate=2011-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Tony Rezko was born in 1955 in [[Aleppo, Syria]], to a prominent [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholic]] family.&lt;ref name=chicagomag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagomag.com/core/pagetools.php?pageid=7030&amp;url=%2FChicago-Magazine%2FNovember-2007%2FMr-Inside-Out%2F&amp;mode=print|title=Mr. Inside Out|publisher=Chicago Magazine|author=Merriner, James L.|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from college there, Rezko moved to [[Chicago]] and earned an undergraduate and a master's degree in civil engineering from the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in the late 1970s. He joined an engineering company, designing [[nuclear power]] plants, then left to design roads for the state Transportation Department, making $21,590 in his first year there.&lt;ref name=Fund-raising&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jackson|first=David|last2=Chase|first2=John|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0610120112oct12,0,3093652.story|title=Rezko's life a story of pizza and politics|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=2006-10-12|accessdate=2007-02-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227041817/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0610120112oct12,0,3093652.story|archivedate=2007-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/355099,cst-nws-rez24a.article|title=Broken promises, broken homes|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Novak, Tim|date=2007-04-24|accessdate=2008-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324131917/http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/355099,cst-nws-rez24a.article|archivedate=2008-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
While he was an engineer, Rezko started buying vacant lots and developing single family residences. He also began investing in [[fast-food]] restaurants, including the first [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] in Chicago. Many properties were in lower-income [[African American]] neighborhoods&lt;ref name=chicagomag/&gt;&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; where he met Jabir Herbert (J.H.) Muhammad, former manager of heavyweight champion [[Muhammad Ali]] and son of the late [[Nation of Islam]] leader, [[Elijah Muhammad]]. Rezko was asked in 1983 to support the successful mayoral candidacy of African-American [[Harold Washington]]. J.H. Muhammad's company, Crucial Concessions, hired Rezko in 1984 and won a food contract on Lake Michigan beaches and in many South Side parks. Rezko put together endorsement deals for Ali, became the executive director of the Muhammad Ali Foundation, and traveled the world with Ali for five years.&lt;ref name=chicagomag/&gt;

In 1997, Crucial Concessions opened two [[Panda Express]] Restaurants at O'Hare, under the city's minority set-aside program. It lost those franchises in 2005, on the grounds that J.H. Muhammad was merely a front man for Rezko, who had been appointed trustee of Elijah Muhammad's affairs in the early 1990s. In March 2008 Muhammad sued Rezko, alleging that he had been swindled out of his home and business interests.&lt;ref name=Novak2/&gt;&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/02/01/rezko/print.html|title=How close were Barack Obama and Tony Rezko?|publisher=Salon|author=McClelland, Edward|date=2008-02-01|accessdate=2008-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418205340/http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/02/01/rezko/print.html|archivedate=2008-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/us/politics/14rezko.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=print|title=An Obama Patron and Friend Until an Indictment|work=The New York Times|date=2007-06-14|accessdate=2008-05-10|first1=Christopher|last1=Drew|first2=Mike|last2=McIntire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1989, Rezko and attorney Daniel Mahru, CEO of a firm that leased ice makers to bars and hotels, founded a real-estate development and restaurant holding corporation called Rezmar Corporation. Between 1989 and 1998, Rezmar rehabilitated 30 buildings, a total of 1,025 apartments, spending more than $100 million from the city, state and federal governments and bank loans. Rezko and Mahru weren't responsible for any government or bank loans or the $50 million in federal tax credits they got to rehab the buildings. Rezmar put just $100 into each project and got a 1% stake as the general partner in charge of hiring the architect, contractor, and the company that would manage the buildings. They selected Chicago Property Management, also owned by Rezko and Mahru, to manage the buildings, including selecting the tenants and making repairs. Rezmar also got upfront development fees of at least $6.9 million in all. Under its deals with the Chicago Equity Fund, Rezmar promised to cover all operating losses in any building for seven years, but had no obligation after that, although the Federal Government could recover the tax credits that Rezmar sold from the holders if the projects did not survive for fifteen years or more.&lt;ref name=Novak2/&gt; By 1998 the company had a net worth of [[United States dollar|US$]]34 million&lt;ref name=Novak&gt;{{cite news|author=Novak, Tim|title=Obama and his Rezko ties|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=2007-04-23|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/353829,CST-NWS-rez23.article|accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it then turned to purchasing old factories and parcels of land in [[gentrification|gentrifying]] areas of Chicago and turning them into upscale condominium complexes.&lt;ref name=Novak2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87830023|title=Q&amp;A: The Tony Rezko Case|author=David Schaper|date=2008-03-06|accessdate=2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rezko was named "Entrepreneur of the Decade" by the Arab-American Business and Professional Association.&lt;ref name=hanania&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themediaoasis.com/profiles/Rezko06-08-05.htm|title=Arabs in Chicago discover political clout and controversy|author=Ray Hanania|publisher=Arab American Media Services|date=2005-06-08|accessdate=2008-01-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915132137/http://www.themediaoasis.com/profiles/Rezko06-08-05.htm|archivedate=2008-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rezko's investment in restaurant food chains had started with a chain of [[Panda Express]] Chinese restaurants. In 1998, Rezko opened his first chain of [[Papa John's Pizza]] restaurants in Chicago and by 2002, he had twenty-six stores in Chicago, at least fifteen in [[Wisconsin]], and seven in Detroit, part of the financing for these stores was through [[GE Capital]].&lt;ref name=Fund-raising/&gt; By 2001, Rezko began to fall behind on his franchise payments and loans and he transferred the franchises to several business associates. In 2006, during a lawsuit with Papa John's over his franchise fees, Rezko renamed his Papa John's restaurants to Papa Tony's.&lt;ref name=hanania/&gt; Rezko also had a lien filed against his home after losing a civil lawsuit to GE Capital.&lt;ref name=Fund-raising/&gt;

As his business ventures began failing, Rezko entered into several partnership with Iraqi-born business executive [[Nadhmi Auchi]], including a massive 2005 real estate development project on Chicago's [[Chicago Loop|South Loop]] whose value was pegged by an observer familiar with the deal at $130.5 million.&lt;ref name="chibus"&gt;[http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=17946 Rezko sells Loop project for $131M]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, Rezko was imprisoned for his  failure to disclose a $3.5m loan from Auchi.

==Legal troubles==
Rezko was later convicted on 16 charges of corruption and fraud and was sentenced to serve 10 1/2 years in prison.

===Public corruption charges===
In October 2006, Rezko was indicted along with businessman Stuart Levine on charges of wire fraud, bribery, money laundering, and attempted extortion as a result of a federal investigation known as "Operation Board Games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/downloads/rezkoindict.pdf|title=Indictment - U.S. vs. Levine and Rezko|format=PDF |publisher=Chicago Business | accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,335592,00.html | title=Courtroom Wire: Notes From Tony Rezko's Corruption Trial | publisher=FOXNews | author=Marla Cichowski | date=2008-04-04 | accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levine was once a top Republican fund-raiser who had switched loyalty in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=22634&amp;seenIt=1|title=Chicago Business News--Stuart Levine Pleads Guilty}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rezko and Levine were charged with attempting to extort millions of dollars from businesses seeking to do business with the Illinois Teachers  System Board and the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board from 2002 to 2004. Levine pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against Rezko and others. While the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison, Levine expects to receive about a 5-1/2&amp;nbsp;year sentence in return for his testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-rezko-19mar19,0,5503877.story | title=Levine weaves tawdry tale | work=Chicago Tribune | author=Secter, Bob |author2=Coen, Jeff  | date=2008-03-19 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was prosecuted by [[Patrick Fitzgerald]].

Rezko pleaded not guilty, and the trial related to his charges from Operation Board Games began on March 6, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-0307edit1mar07,1,5412814.story | archive-url=https://archive.is/20081214193252/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-0307edit1mar07,1,5412814.story | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2008-12-14 | title=One Tony, three trials | work=Chicago Tribune | date=2008-03-07 | accessdate=2008-05-10 }} &lt;/ref&gt; He was jailed shortly before the trial began when he received a $3.5&amp;nbsp;million wire transfer from Lebanon. Rezko had told the court that he had no access to money from overseas. Ten weeks into the trial, on April 18, Judge Amy St. Eve released Rezko, after friends and relatives put up 30 properties valued at about $8.5&amp;nbsp;million to secure his bond. Prosecutors opposed the motion for release, saying that Rezko was a flight risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-rezko-fridayapr20,1,7431091.story | title=Rezko free on bail |work= Chicago Tribune |author= Coen, Jeff |date= 2008-04-20 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 6, both the prosecution and the defense rested their cases. Government prosecutors spent 8 weeks presenting their case. Rezko’s lawyer, Joseph J. Duffy, chose not to present any witnesses, saying that he did not believe that the prosecution had proven the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/us/06brfs-002.html?ref=us | title=Illinois: No Defense Witnesses for Rezko | work=The New York Times | author=Einhorn Catrin | date=2008-05-06 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors contended that they had shown Rezko's "corrupt use of his power and influence" to gain benefits for himself and his friends. Duffy argued that the prosecution had exaggerated Rezko's influence in state government, and attacked Levine's credibility as a witness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-rezko_for_tuesdaymay13,0,553455.story Corrupt mastermind or victim of frame-up?] Chicago Tribune, May 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The case went to the jury on May 13 and after three weeks of deliberation, the jury found Rezko guilty of six counts of wire fraud, six counts of mail fraud, two counts of corrupt solicitation, and two counts of money laundering, but found him not guilty on three counts of wire and mail fraud, one count of attempted extortion, and four counts of corrupt solicitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/politics&amp;id=6185320 | title=Rezko found guilty on 16 counts | publisher=ABCNews | date=2008-06-04 | accessdate=2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to CBS News the "high-profile federal trial provided an unusually detailed glimpse of the pay-to-play politics that has made Illinois infamous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cbs2chicago.com/local/rezko.trial.verdict.2.740375.html |title=Jury Finds Tony Rezko Guilty On 16 Of 24 Charges |publisher=CBS 2 |author=Parker, Mike |date=2008-06-04 |accessdate=2008-06-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605063726/http://cbs2chicago.com/local/rezko.trial.verdict.2.740375.html |archivedate=2008-06-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the jury was deliberating on the Board Games trial, an arrest warrant was issued in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] for passing bad checks in two casinos and failing to pay $450,000 in gambling debts that were accrued between March and July 2006.&lt;ref name=Casino_debt&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/rezko/977195,rezkogamble052908.article | title=Las Vegas judge issues arrest warrant for Tony Rezko over alleged gambling debts | work=Chicago Sun-Times | author=Korecki, Natasha |authorlink=Natasha Korecki| date=2008-05-29 | accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another casino had also filed a civil complaint for a total of $331,000 in 2006 and was given a judgment of default in 2007.&lt;ref name=Casino_debt/&gt;

===Charges related to private business dealings===
Rezko was indicted, along with a business associate, for wire fraud related to the alleged sale of his pizza business to a straw buyer at an inflated price in order to obtain millions of dollars in loans from [[GE Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Robinson, Mike | title=Blagojevich Adviser Indicted on Charges | work=The Washington Post | date=2006-10-11 | accessdate=2007-03-17 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/11/AR2006101100918.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rezko initially pleaded not guilty to these charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-rezkojun08,0,3297509.story | title=Rezko faces next trial: Date set in pizza case | work=Chicago Tribune | date=2008-06-08 | accessdate=2008-06-11 | first1=Stacy | last1=St Clair | first2=Jodi S | last2=Cohen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, Rezko would change his plea to guilty.&lt;ref name=uqovz&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/22/tony-rezko-sentenced-blag_n_1165774.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Tony Rezko Sentenced: Former Blagojevich Fundraiser Won't Serve More Time For New Conviction | date=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of a plea deal and his agreement to drop his appeal of his previous conviction, Rezko pleaded guilty to wire fraud and was given a 7 1/2 year sentence to run concurrently with the 10 1/2-year sentence he is presently serving for his previous conviction.&lt;ref name=uqovz /&gt;

===Release from federal prison===

In July 2015 Tony Rezko was released from federal prison to a halfway house in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/7/71/752319/tony-rezko-released-halfway-house | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Onetime Obama donor Tony Rezko released to halfway house | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709063619/http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/7/71/752319/tony-rezko-released-halfway-house | archivedate=2015-07-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ties to politicians==

===Ties to Rod Blagojevich===
Rezko's relationship with Illinois Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] and his family were at the root of the federal corruption case which led to Rezko's conviction.&lt;ref name=Fund-raising/&gt; Rezko donated $117,652 to Blagojevich's campaigns,&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; and is credited by the prosecutor in his trial with having delivered [[Bundling (fundraising)|bundled]] contributions totalling almost $1.44 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/hot/us_v_rezko_exhibits/2008_03_07/fob_chart_2.pdf |title=FOB Chart 2 |publisher=United States Department of Justice |date=2008-03-07 |accessdate=2008-05-10 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625021242/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/hot/us_v_rezko_exhibits/2008_03_07/fob_chart_2.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, Blagojevich's wife, Patricia, has made at least $38,000 acting as Rezko's real-estate agent on several of his company's property acquisitions. When Blagojevich won the Illinois gubernatorial election in 2002, Rezko assisted Blagojevich in setting up the state's first Democratic administration in twenty years.&lt;ref name=Fund-raising/&gt; Rezko recommended many of his business associates and their relatives for positions within state government, three of whom were appointed to the state board that oversees hospital projects. the state's development board was run by another former Rezko business associate. Rezko and Republican fundraiser Stuart Levine were charged in a 24-count federal indictment for allegedly using Rezko's influence with public officials to demand millions of dollars in kickbacks from companies that wanted to do business with the state.&lt;ref name=Fund-raising/&gt;&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;  Levine pleaded guilty and served as the chief witness against Rezko at trial.  Levine and several other witnesses implicated Blagojevich in the schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-rezko-20mar20,0,1964917.story | title=Name on Levine's lips at trial: Blagojevich | work= Chicago Tribune | author=Coen, Jeff |author2=Secter, Bob  | date=2008-03-20 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-rezko-02-both-may02,0,4933871.story | title= Ali Ata testifies he paid Rezko, donated to Blagojevich | work= Chicago Tribune | author=Secter, Bob  |author2=Coen, Jeff  |date=2008-05-01 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last indictment in [[Operation Board Games]] before Blagojevich himself was indicted was that of [[William F. Cellini]] who was indicted for conspiring with Rezko to [[Extortion|shake down]] Chicago-based Capri Capital to get a substantial contribution to Blagojevich in exchange for allowing Capri to manage $220 million in the Teachers Retirement System.  After Thomas Rosenberg of Capri threatened to tell authorities, the plan was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel08/oct30_08a.pdf William F.

===Ties to Barack Obama===

====History====
In 1990, after [[Barack Obama]] was elected president of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', Rezmar Corp. offered him a job, which Obama turned down.  Obama instead took a job with the firm of Davis, Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland,&lt;ref&gt;now Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland. {{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-obamalegal6apr06,0,26672.story |title=Obama's lawyer days: brief and not all civil rights |work=Los Angeles Times |author=Morain, Dan |date=2008-04-06 |accessdate=2008-05-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410052901/http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-obamalegal6apr06,0,26672.story |archivedate=2008-04-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which primarily worked on civil rights cases. The firm also represented Rezmar and helped the company get more than $43&amp;nbsp;million in government funding. The firm's former senior partner, Allison S. Davis, later went into business with Rezko and, in 2003, was appointed to the Illinois State Board of Investment by Governor Blagojevich at Rezko's request.&lt;ref name=Novak/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/644511,CST-NWS-davis11.article |title=How reform-minded City Hall critic became a cozy insider | work=Chicago Sun-Times | author=Novak, Tim | date=2007-11-11 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31, 1995, the first ever political contributions to Obama were $300 from a lawyer, a $5,000 loan from a car dealer, and $2,000 from two food companies owned by Rezko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/353829,CST-NWS-rez23.article |title=Obama and his Rezko ties | work=Chicago Sun\Times | author=Novak, Tim | date=2007-04-23 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2003, Rezko was one of the people on Obama's U.S. Senate campaign finance committee, which raised more than $14&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Novak/&gt; Rezko organized an early fundraiser for Obama that [[Chicago Tribune]] reporter David Mendell claims was instrumental in providing Obama with seed money for his U.S. Senate race.&lt;ref name=chicagomag/&gt; Obama in 2007-2008 identified over $250,000 in campaign contributions to various Obama campaigns as coming from Rezko or close associates, and said that he donated almost two-thirds of that amount to nonprofit groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/844634,obamasun031508.article | title=Obama explains Rezko relationship to Sun-Times | work=Chicago Sun-Times | author=Chris Fusco |author2=David McKinney |author3=Tim Novak |author4=Abdon M.

====Real estate dealings====
In 2005 Obama purchased a new home in the Kenwood District of Chicago for $1.65&amp;nbsp;million (which was $300,000 below the asking price but represented the highest offer on the property) on the same day that Rezko's wife, Rita Rezko, purchased the adjoining empty lot from the same sellers for the full asking price.&lt;ref name="Land deal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0611010273nov01,0,1188525.story?page=1|title=Rezko owns vacant lot next to Obama's home|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Ray Gibson|author2=David Jackson |date=2006-11-01|accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama acknowledged bringing his interest in the property to Rezko's attention,&lt;ref&gt;"Asked who approached her about the house, Schwan [the seller's broker] told Salon, 'I honestly don't remember. Tony Rezko lived across the street, so he'd been interested in the lot.'"{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/02/01/rezko/print.html|title=How close were Barack Obama and Tony Rezko?|publisher=Salon.com|author=McClelland, Edward|date=2008-02-01|accessdate=2008-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418205340/http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/02/01/rezko/print.html|archivedate=2008-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but denied any coordination of offers. According to Obama, while the properties had originally been a single property, the previous owners decided to sell the land as two separate lots, but made it a condition of the sales that they be closed on the same date. Obama also stated that the properties had been on the market for months, that his offer was the better of two bids, and that Ms. Rezko's bid was matched by another offer, also of $625,000, so that she could not have purchased the property for less.&lt;ref name=mistake&gt;{{cite news|author=McKinney, Dave|author2=Fusco, Chris |title=Obama on Rezko deal: It was a mistake|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=2006-11-05|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/124171,CST-NWS-obama05.article|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After it had been reported in 2006 that Rezko was under federal investigation for influence-peddling, Obama purchased a 10-foot-wide strip of Ms. Rezko's property for $104,500, $60,000 above the assessed value.&lt;ref name=Novak/&gt;&lt;ref name="Land deal"/&gt; According to ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' columnist, Mark Brown, "Rezko definitely did Obama a favor by selling him the 10-foot strip of land, making his own parcel less attractive for development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Brown, Mark|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/121104,CST-NWS-brown02.article|title=Obama's dealings with Rezko buy a parcel of questions|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=2006-11-02|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama acknowledges that the exchange may have created the appearance of impropriety and stated "I consider this a mistake on my part and I regret it."&lt;ref name=mistake/&gt;

On December 28, 2006, Mrs. Rezko sold the property to a company owned by her husband's former business attorney. That sale of $575,000, combined with the earlier $104,500 sale to the Obamas, amounted to a [[net profit]] of $54,500 over her original purchase, less $14,000 for a fence along the property line and other expenses.&lt;ref&gt;The $54,500 figure is before any property tax and other expenses Ms. Rezko incurred during her ownership&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/obama/chi-0702240237feb24,0,5895873.story|title=Rezko sells lot next to Obama|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Jackson, David|author2=Ray Gibson |date=2007-02-24|accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, the new owners put the still vacant land up for sale again, this time for $1.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/595915,CST-NWS-obama10.article|title=Lot next to Obama can be yours for $1.5M|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Novak, Tim|date=2007-10-10|accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Obama's letters====
In June 2007, the ''Sun-Times'' published a story about letters Obama had written in 1997 to city and state officials in support of a low-income senior citizen development project headed by Rezko and Davis. The project received more than $14&amp;nbsp;million in taxpayer funds, including $885,000 in development fees for Rezko and Davis. Of Obama's letters in support of the Cottage View Terrace apartments development, Obama spokesman Bill Burton said, "This wasn't done as a favor for anyone; it was done in the interests of the people in the community who have benefited from the project. I don't know that anyone specifically asked him to write this letter nine years ago. There was a consensus in the community about the positive impact the project would make and Obama supported it because it was going to help people in his district." Rezko's attorney responded that "Mr. Rezko never spoke with, nor sought a letter from, Senator Obama in connection with that project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Novak, Tim|title=Obama's letters for Rezko|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=2007-06-13|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/425305,CST-NWS-obama13.article|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[South Carolina Democratic Party]] presidential debate on January 21, 2008, Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] said that Obama had been associated with Rezko, whom she referred to as a [[slumlord|slum landlord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Healy, Patrick|author2=Zeleny, Jeff |title=Obama and Clinton Tangle at Debate|work=The New York Times|date=2008-01-22|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/22/us/politics/22dems.html?em&amp;ex=1201150800&amp;en=6ae2b7e80f2fc272&amp;ei=5087%0A|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' indicated that its own review showed Rezko played a deeper role in Obama's political and financial biography than Obama has acknowledged.&lt;ref name=rezoba&gt;{{cite news|author=Morain, Dan|author2=Hamburger, Tom |title=Obama dogged by ties to donor|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2008-01-23|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/23/nation/na-rezko23|accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days of the debate, a photo of Rezko posing with [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] surfaced. When asked about the photo, Hillary Clinton commented: "I probably have taken hundreds of thousands of pictures. I wouldn't know him if he walked in the door."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://youdecide08.foxnews.com/2008/01/25/photo-surfaces-showing-sen-clinton-posing-with-chicago-landlord-rezko|title=Photo Surfaces Showing Sen.

===Ties to other politicians===
Rezko's first significant political act was hosting a fundraiser for [[Harold Washington]] during Washington's successful campaign to become Chicago's mayor.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; He has since raised funds for many other politicians.&lt;ref name=Sneed&gt;{{cite news|author=Sneed, Michael|title=The Rezko scandal&amp;nbsp;...|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=2006-10-12|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/sneed/93087,CST-NWS-sneed12.article|accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Blagojevich and Obama, prominent Democrats that Rezko or his company, Rezmar, have contributed money to, or fund-raised for, are Congressman [[Luis Gutierrez]], a friend for over two decades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Novak|title=Luis' deal with Rezko|date=2006-11-14|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/135305,CST-NWS-luis14.article|work =Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comptroller [[Daniel Hynes|Dan Hynes]], Attorney General [[Lisa Madigan]], Lieutenant Governor [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]], former Chicago Mayors Daley and Washington, and former Cook County Board President [[John Stroger]].&lt;ref name=Fund-raising/&gt; Rezko has also raised money for Republicans, including former Illinois Governors [[Jim Edgar]] and [[George Ryan]].&lt;ref name=chicagomag/&gt; The late [[Rosemont, Illinois]], Mayor [[Donald Stephens]] and Rezko co-chaired a multimillion-dollar fund-raiser for President [[George W. Bush]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=Novak2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sneed/&gt;

Rezko headed the 2002 campaign finance committee for Stroger. Stroger appointed Rezko's wife, Rita, to the Cook County Employee Appeals Board, which hears cases brought by fired or disciplined workers. The part-time post pays $37,000 a year.&lt;ref name=chicagomag/&gt; A Rezko company had a contract to maintain pay telephones at the [[Cook County Jail]] under Stroger. The ''Chicago Sun-Times'' puts Rezko's contributions to Stroger at $148,300.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
