{{for|the 1691 anonymous reprint of the ''Gazophylacium Anglicanum'' under the title ''A New English Dictionary''|Gazophylacium Anglicanum}}
'''''A New English Dictionary: or, a complete collection of the most proper and significant words, commonly used in the language''''' was an English dictionary compiled by [[philologist]] [[John Kersey the younger|John Kersey]] and first published in London in 1702.

Unlike previous dictionaries, which had focused on documenting difficult words, ''A New English Dictionary'' was one of the first to focus on words in common usage. It was also the first to be written by a professional [[lexicographer]].

Kersey later continued his lexicographic career by enlarging [[Edward Phillips]]' ''[[The New World of English Words]]'' in 1706 and editing the ''[[Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum]]'' in 1708.

The original title of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' was ''A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles'', and it was sometimes given the abbreviation ''NED'', for ''New English Dictionary''.

'''Anti-Thai sentiment''' involves hostility or hatred that is directed towards [[Thai people]], or the state of [[Thailand]].

== Incidents by country ==
=== Cambodia ===
{{see also|2003 Phnom Penh riots|Cambodian–Thai border dispute}}
The hatred toward Thais in Cambodia had existed since the late [[Khmer Empire]]. Siamese force under the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] had overrun Khmer Empire many times, leaving a big scar over Cambodia. Siam also occupied Cambodia on the history as well, turning Cambodians against Thais.

Anti-Thai sentiment began to flare in Cambodia because of Cambodians' fear of Thai designs on western Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald E. Weatherbee|title=International Relations in Southeast Asia: The Struggle for Autonomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Obi-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134|date=17 October 2008|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0-7425-5739-0|pages=134–}}&lt;/ref&gt; That led to a violent protest in January 2003 in which the Thai embassy was burned and Thai businesses were vandalised after a Cambodian newspaper article falsely alleged that a Thai actress had claimed that [[Angkor Wat]] belonged to Thailand and that it should take over the ancient temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/1560889|title=Whose Angkor Wat?|publisher=The Economist|date=30 January 2003|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/19/world/cambodian-pique-at-thais-lingers.html|title=Cambodian Pique at Thais Lingers|author=David Barboza|publisher=The New York Times|date=19 April 2003|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hatred towards Thai people from the Cambodians would escalate in 2008, when both countries were involved in the conflict on the ownership of [[Preah Vihear Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2008/0722/p06s02-wosc.html|title=Why Thai-Cambodian temple dispute lingers|author=Simon Montlake|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=22 July 2008|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
Animosity towards the Thai in China 1934 followed discrimination of Chinese in Thailand by Thai authorities. Some of the Chinese who had been deported from Thailand began to spread anti-Thai sentiment in China and called for an immediate boycott from the Chinese authorities to all products that been imported from Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seung-Joon Lee|title=Gourmets in the Land of Famine: The Culture and Politics of Rice in Modern Canton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nm85UcbeOZcC&amp;pg=PA172|date=5 January 2011|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-7226-6|pages=172–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laos ===
Since ancient times, Laos has been against Siamese territorial expansions although both shared the similar religion and there was even a request from Laotians to the French colonial authorities for a recovery of lost territory on the [[Khorat Plateau]] and of the [[Emerald Buddha]] from Siam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Søren Ivarsson|title=Creating Laos: The Making of a Lao Space Between Indochina and Siam, 1860-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FsXjlJF_fokC&amp;pg=PA166|date=January 2008|publisher=NIAS Press|isbn=978-87-7694-023-2|pages=166–}}&lt;/ref&gt; After achieving independence under communism, the present Laos government are much more sympathetic to Vietnam, and there is a rejection from Laotians towards Thailand, which is a democratic country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Keat Gin Ooi|title=Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;pg=PA772|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-770-2|pages=772–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Myanmar ===
Both nations shared the same religion and were involved in several wars in the past. In the present, there is more anti-Myanmar sentiment in Thailand than anti-Thai sentiment in Myanmar, as is shown by the publications of Thai school textbooks, films and media reports. The Myanmar government does not regard Thailand as its main enemy but does not consider Thailand as a "trusted friend" either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N Ganesan|title=Bilateral Legacies in East and Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cv-gCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122|date=27 July 2015|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=978-981-4620-41-3|pages=122–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western expatriates ===
Western expatriates have some anti-Thai sentiment, mainly because of their difficulties in integrating to Thai society as well as both sides' social superiority complex.

'''Biebel''' is the title character of a Flemish satirical comic strip series written by [[Marc Legendre]], under the pseudonym of Ikke. It was created in 1983 for the magazine ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Robbedoes]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marc Legendre|url=http://lambiek.net/artists/l/legendre_m.htm|publisher=Lambiek|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was published until 2002.

Biebel successfully appeared in 28 [[comic album]]s published by [[Standaard Uitgeverij]], the first of which was released in 1985, and the series were also published in the magazine ''[[Suske en Wiske Weekblad]]''.

==Concept==

Biebel is a bald headed boy with a sarcastic attitude towards life. His best friend Reggie is more happy and carefree and thus an irritation to Biebel. Many Biebel comics are [[gag-a-day]] pages, but some are longer stories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40562">The '''Budapest Museum Quarter''' is a proposed new cultural and [[Tourist attraction|tourist site]] to be located on [[Andrassy ut|Andrássy út]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], and has at its core the merger of the [[Hungarian National Gallery]] with the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Budapest Museum of Fine Arts]] into one institution. The concept has been around since at least 2008 when the Director of the Museum of Fine Arts proposed combining the two collections. In 2010, the Fidesz political party included the idea in its election campaign. Several other Budapest museums would be affected by the plan, which faces not only economic and legal hurdles, but also criticism from both members of the public and art professionals alike.

==Background==

===Hungarian national museum system===
National museums in Hungary are those institutions that are state–owned and centrally financed. Many of them were created in the late 19th century under the [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] as specialized complementary institutions to the original [[Hungarian National Museum]]. Although they received state sponsorship, the museums within this system — including the [[Hungarian Natural History Museum|Museum of Natural History]], [[Ethnographic Museum (Budapest)|Museum of Ethnography]], [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]], [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], the [[Hungarian National Gallery|National Gallery]] and pre–World War II, the [[National Library of Hungary|National Library and Archives]] — operated autonomously with their own board and endowment.  However, with the introduction of [[Communism in Hungary|Communism into Hungary]] in 1949, they lost their autonomy and were governed by the state under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Apor|first=Péter|title=The National Museum in Hungary: Approaches to Its Analysis|journal=Conference on Building National Museums: 1750–2010|date=March 30 – April 1, 2011|url=http://www.eunamus.eu/bologna-reports/hungary.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Magyar Nemzeti Múzeum.jpg|thumb | Façade of the Hungarian National Museum]]

The [[Hungarian National Museum]] is an important symbol of [[national identity]] because it played a major role in the anti-Habsburg [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]] when the revolutionaries read their list of twelve demands, as well as a nationalistic poem on its front steps. The site is still used annually by the government to commemorate those events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Gov't, civil organizations reach deal on sharing Budapest streets on March 15|url=http://www.politics.hu/20120217/govt-civil-organizations-reach-deal-on-sharing-the-streets-on-march-15/|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Politics.hu|date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fidesz government (2010)===

====Cultural policy====
After winning a two–thirds parliamentary majority in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|2010 elections]], [[Fidesz]] or the Hungarian Civic Union party began what was called a "hands–on cultural policy" that included appointing a media watchdog "that has the power to fine media outlets deemed to violate public interest, order and morals". It was suggested by members of the Hungarian art community that the center–right government was also influencing the appointment of a new director for the [[Kunsthalle Budapest|Budapest Art Hall]] (Műcsarnok) when the prior, Socialist–appointed incumbent's term ran out at the end of 2010. [[Francesca von Habsburg|Francesca Von Habsburg]] was considered a favorite of the new, conservative government and a front–runner in the selection process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=After censorship row, what next in Hungary?|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles//23070|accessdate=1 February 2012|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, instead of choosing a candidate from this transparent process launched in November 2010, the Secretary of State for Culture [[Géza Szőcs]] (a recent Fidesz appointee) personally approved the decision to hire Gábor Gulyás, former director of the Centre for Modern and Contemporary Arts (MODEM) in Debrecen, Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Surprise appointment at Budapest's Mucsarnok|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/comings-and-goings/2011/3|accessdate=1 February 2012|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, László Harsanyi, the director of the [http://old.hdke.hu/index.php?changelang=eng Holocaust Memorial Center] and his chief historical adviser, Judit Molnár, were both relieved of their posts after the State Secretary for the Ministry of Public Administration and Justice, András Levente Gál, objected to the museum's display of an image of Hungary’s interwar leader [[Miklós Horthy]]. Saying that "this kind of historical inaccuracy [unjustifiably linking Hungary to the deportation of Jews to Nazi concentration camps] creates unnecessary tension," Gál drew the wrath of dozens of local historians and social scientists. But according to Molnár, "we could not change the permanent exhibition to align with the new political expectations since we regard that as a falsification of history." A Fidesz party MP and former chairman of the parliamentary cultural and press committee László Simon was also appointed to lead the National Cultural Fund of Hungary, which until then had been independent of the government. Other early 2012 replacements included that of Győrgy Szabó, director of [http://www.trafo.hu/en-US Trafó] — a leading contemporary art center — by choreographer Yvette Bozsik, and the director of Budapest’s Új Szinház theater, István Márta by György Dörner, an actor with extreme right–wing political affiliations. According to art historian Éva Forgács, “the government wants to disrupt the fabric of Hungarian culture, by having leading cultural figures disappear and replacing them with their own.” However, Simon dismissed any controversies over his and similar appointments as being politically motivated by the opposition.&lt;ref name=Michalska&gt;{{cite news|last=Michalska|first=Julia|title=Hungary's government tightens grip on arts|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Hungary%E2%80%99s-government-tightens-grip-on-arts/25561|accessdate=21 February 2012|newspaper=The Arts Newspaper|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the government decreed that the network of over two hundred county museums that had been in operation for more than a century would fall under the auspices of local city governments. However, the deputy leader of the parliamentary cultural committee Gergely Karácsony criticized the decision, arguing that it went against professional standards and that a much better choice would have been unifying the galleries and museums under the [[Hungarian National Museum]] system. This would have allowed them to be state-funded, instead of relying on already underfunded local budgets that may lead to the closing of these institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=LMP: múzeumok fognak bezárni|url=http://hvg.hu/kultura/20120411_lmp_muzeumok_bezaras|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=hvg.hu|date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitutional changes====
On January 1, 2012, [[Constitution of Hungary#2011 Constitution|amendments created in the spring of 2011]] by Fidesz to the [[Constitution of Hungary|Hungarian Constitution]] took effect and were not only criticized by many citizens within the country, but also by forces within the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]]. Some of these changes included "a [[preamble]] committed to defending the intellectual and spiritual unity of the nation", references to previously excluded social issues like the definition of marriage and modifications to the [[electoral process]]. Within days, tens of thousands of people marched in protest in Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hungarians protest against new Fidesz constitution|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16387117|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the government defended replacing the old Constitution stating that it was "high time" for the changes to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hungarian government defends controversial Constitution|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16395791|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support his May 2010 remarks that “Hungarian culture must be refreshed with works of art, prizes, celebrations”, as well as publicize the legislative changes, [[Prime Minister]] [[Viktor Orbán]] opened a special government–organized exhibit at the National Gallery highlighting the sovereign statehood and Christianity within the 1,000 years of Hungarian history. Included in the show, which runs through August 2012, are 15 large, state–commissioned works depicting important events from the country's past 150 years, including a canvas of Orbán himself.&lt;ref name="Michalska"/&gt;

Facing increasing pressure from the EU, by mid–January 2012 the Fidesz government had agreed to change parts of the new legislation regarding constitutional changes to the independence of the central bank, the judiciary and data protection. However, they did not agree to change language regarding the cultural components of the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Casert|first=Raf|title=Hungary plans changes to controversial legislation|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2012/01/18/international/i065206S24.DTL|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=SFGate|date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The project==

===Initial proposals===
The concept of a separate museum district within [[Budapest]] was a Fidesz campaign platform during the 2010 elections. It included plans for the area from the [[Western Railway Station (Budapest)|Western Railway Station]] to the current [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], located on [[Hősök tere|Heroes' Square]], to house a newly built Museum of Hungarian Modern Art, as well as a House of Europe for all the countries represented on the continent. The [[Ethnographic Museum (Budapest)|Museum of Ethnography]] would also be moved to this newly planned district. The project was intended by the party to "serve as a cultural–touristic–gastronomic centre with an exhibition and music hall and information centre" and be realized over a period of 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fidesz announces plans for budapest museum quarter|url=http://www.realdeal.hu/20100303/fidesz-announces-plans-for-budapest-museum-quarter/|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=MTI|date=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposal was unveiled by [[István Tarlós]], who at the time was chairman of the Fidesz party and who became [[mayor of Budapest]] later that same year. Consequently, a consensus developed during a series of professional debates that a museum master plan was essential because there was a real need for: a modern 21st century institution; an emphasis to collect and exhibit 20th century Hungarian art in an international context; and the expansion of media to include architecture, design, photography and media arts. Speculation by the press as to why none of these proposals seemed to get beyond the discussion and debate stage included the observation that "the prevailing cultural policy since the political transformation has been to continue with the old model — that is, the use of direct control instead of a structural transformation based on dialogue".&lt;ref name=Melyi&gt;{{cite news|last=Mélyi|first=József|title=Notes for a Budapest Museum Master Plan|url=http://www.artmargins.com/index.php/2-articles/606-notes-for-a-budapest-museum-master-plan-|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=Art Margins Online|date=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the director of the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], László Baán, proposed the merging of his museum with that of the [[Hungarian National Gallery|National Gallery]], due to the similar exhibition and collection profile of the two. Both (along with the Ludwig Museum of Contemporary Art) specialize in 20th century and [[Contemporary art|contemporary fine art]], much of which was created by Hungarian artists living overseas.&lt;ref name="Melyi"/&gt; After his request to add an €18million underground extension to the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] — which would have united collections spread across the city — was denied in February 2011, Baán presented an alternative plan to the government to build two new buildings at the cost of €150m. He envisioned the new buildings — one housing contemporary European art and the other Hungarian photography — as a "special museum island" that would complement the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Kunsthalle Budapest|Budapest Art Hall]] (Műcsarnok) by permanently joining the two collections by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=Budapest director's double vision for national museum|journal=The Art Newspaper|date=3 August 2011|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Budapest-directors-double-vision-for-national-museum/24249|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current plans===
In September 2011, Secretary of State for Culture [[Géza Szőcs]] officially announced plans to build a new structure along [[Andrassy ut|Andrássy út]] close to [[Városliget|City Park]] and near the existing [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Budapest Museum of Fine Arts]] and [[Kunsthalle Budapest|Budapest Art Hall]] (Műcsarnok).  This building would house the collections of the current [[Hungarian National Gallery]].&lt;ref name=MTI&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Government commissioner appointed for planned "museum quarter" in Budapest|url=http://www.realdeal.hu/20111003/museum-of-fine-arts-director-appointed-as-museums-quarter-government-commissioner/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Realdeal.hu|date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expanded plan, which would utilize the entire boulevard, is also referred to as the Andrássy Quarter.&lt;ref name=Foldes&gt;{{cite news|last=Földes|first=András|title=Houdini-cirkusz es fiákerek az Andrássyn|url=http://index.hu/belfold/budapest/2011/09/15/houdini_cirkusz_es_egyeb_megaberuhazasok_a_fovarosban/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=index.hu|date=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project would also involve the addition of a tunnel to redirect existing vehicular traffic, thereby creating a pedestrian–only zone that hasn't existed on [[Andrassy ut|Andrássy út]] since the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=DAmato&gt;{{cite news|last=D'Amato|first=Erik|title=The mad plan to kill off Budapest's best walking street|url=http://www.realdeal.hu/20110926/the-mad-plan-to-kill-off-budapests-best-walking-street/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Realdeal.hu|date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to other new venues for eating and entertainment on [[Andrassy ut|Andrássy út]], there would also be changes made to [[Városliget|City Park]]. One of these would be to rename the Hungarian State Circus after [[Harry Houdini]], whose background as a Hungarian was relatively unknown even though he was world famous. This version of the project would take eight years and cost 20 billion [[Hungarian forint|HUF]].&lt;ref name="Foldes"/&gt; After submission of a detailed proposal to the cabinet (expected in summer 2012), construction could begin by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hungary around the clock|title=Planned Budapest "museum quarter" could be completed by 2017, official says|url=http://www.realdeal.hu/20111028/planned-budapest-museum-quarter-could-be-completed-by-2017-official-says/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Realdeal.hu|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architectural design for this "New Gallery" will be chosen based on an international competition.&lt;ref name=Unwin&gt;{{cite news|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=Budapest 'mega–project' to defy the downturn|url=http://www.aica.hu/doc/baan_interview_tan_november.pdf|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appointments and resignations===
According to the Hungarian News Agency ([[Magyar Távirati Iroda|MTI]]), on October 1, 2011 László Baán was appointed to a two–year term as the government commissioner in charge of developing the new museum quarter, in addition to his existing position as director of the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]].  In his new post, Baán will report directly to the Prime Minister, but will not get additional pay.  He will be responsible for “preparing the concept, execution and architectural design–tender for a building complex to house the national public collection in Budapest’s 56–ers Square, with a special focus on merging the collections of the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Hungarian National Gallery]]".&lt;ref name="MTI"/&gt;

Baán has faced criticism before from both other institutions and interest groups, having radically transformed his museum from 2004 onward from one of relative obscurity to being an extensive contributor of loans to major international exhibits. While his process of fast modernization and innovation was supported by the government, it went against the typical standard of slow (or even non-existent) change in non–contemporary, eastern European museums.&lt;ref name="Unwin"/&gt;

In early December 2011, Ferenc Csák — director of the [[Hungarian National Gallery]] since 2010 and critical of the proposed merger of the gallery with the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]]— called the merge process “[v]ery unprofessional, anti–democratic and short–sighted” and announced that he would resign at the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=Hungarian national gallery director resigns in protest|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Hungarian+national+gallery+director+resigns+in+protest/25182|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 5, 2012, a new director had not been named and the [[Hungarian National Gallery]] was being led by Deputy General Director György Szűcs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact|url=http://www.mng.hu/en/contact|work=Hungarian National Gallery|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests and opposition==

===Political===
This is not the first time that a recent Hungarian government has proposed the integration of multiple public institutions into one location.  The plan is similar to that of the Government District which was to be built in generally the same area of Budapest behind the Western Railway Station in 2009 under the direction of then Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]]. However, that proposal — which was touted by the government as a green initiative to save on resources — was scrapped in early 2008 due to the enormous projected costs of rebuilding the infrastructure around the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jámbor|first=Gyula|title=Kormány negyed nélkül|url=http://mno.hu/migr_1834/kormany_negyed_nelkul-365046|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=Index.hu|date=19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peace March for Hungary 2012.01.21 (10).JPG|thumb | left | 2012 Pro Government demonstration]]
There was speculation by historian András Gerő that [[Fidesz]]'s recent policy changes stem from its staunch anti–communist stance, which "is not blindly ideological but driven by cold political calculation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunai|first=Márton|title=Hungary's Orban seeks to wipe out Communist past|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/01/uk-hungary-communism-idUSLNE81001C20120201|work=Reuters|accessdate=1 February 2012|date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resignation of former National Gallery director Ferenc Csák was partly motivated by the Fidesz government's exhibition [http://www.mng.hu/en/exhibitions/hosok_nyito_en ''Heroes, Kings, Saints. Images and Documents from the History of Hungary''] which he criticized by saying, “The government shouldn’t have the power to order exhibitions with such a high political agenda. Museums shouldn’t be getting involved in politics.”&lt;ref name=Michalska/&gt;

Moving the collections of the National Gallery to a new location would leave the [[Buda Castle]] empty and available for other use. Although the government has made it clear that they will move out of the Parliament building by 2014, officials have not stated whether it is their intention to move government offices — including that of the Prime Minister — into the Castle once it is vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Földes|first=András|title=Mozgólépcső vinne a Várba a Duna–partról|url=http://index.hu/belfold/budapest/2011/09/14/mozgolepcso_vinne_a_varba_a_duna_partrol/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=index.hu|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buda Castle Day.JPG|thumb|Buda Castle — current home of the National Gallery]]

===Economic===

In November 2011, Hungary was downgraded to [[junk status]] by one of the big international rating agencies. In spite of this, several major projects are planned for Budapest within the next few years, including that of the Museum Quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fischer|first=Patricia|title=The five projects we are watching|url=http://www.bbj.hu/business/the-five-projects-we-are-watching_61671|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Budapest Business Journal|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing criticism regarding the timing of such an expensive project with a weak economic situation, László Baán defended the Hungarian government's plans by saying that they are "making use of various instruments for dealing with the critical economic situation, many of which are surprising, unusual and, for that very reason, ferociously debated." However, he also added that "it fits perfectly with the logic of this government to launch a cultural mega–project of such emblematic significance right in the middle of general budget cuts: one which, besides its intrinsic value, also expresses an extremely important symbolic message".&lt;ref name="Unwin"/&gt;

===Legal===
There is also a legal hurdle to the various construction plans because of the existing zoning restrictions in the proposed location for the new buildings. The developed area within the [[Városliget|City Park]] is already five percent over the allowable two percent limit, and this includes the site chosen by the government for the new museum. The [[zoning laws]] are reviewed every five or ten years; thereby any current plans would be considered illegal.&lt;ref name=Foldes/&gt;

===Social===
In addition to opposition to the merging of the museums, the establishment of the museum quarter by forcing cars off [[Andrassy ut|Andrássy út]] also received criticism. Arguments included the fact that the scale of the massive boulevard is much too large to be restricted to only pedestrians and the wide, tree–lined sidewalks that exist are already adequate. Many of the shops along the route are also empty — a sign of the current status of the Hungarian economy — and would not make for a welcome sight to targeted tourists.&lt;ref name="DAmato"/&gt;

[[File:Andrassy-ut-budapest.jpg|thumb | left|Andrássy út in Budapest]]

Art professionals have criticized László Baán's capacity to lead an endeavor to unite two such massive museums because he is not an art historian nor a museologist, but rather an economist by training. They fear that a merge would potentially damage Hungarian cultural heritage, both literally and figuratively. Additionally, leading Hungarian art historians worry that the physical move of such a large and valuable collection as that of the National Gallery is unprofessional and irresponsible. Between December 17, 2011 and the deadline for the merge on February 29, 2012 an online petition entitled "Protest Against the Merger of the Hungarian National Gallery and the Museum of Fine Arts" that was created by these individuals had received 2,945 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sármány-Parsons|first=Ilona|title=Information on the Proposed Dissolution of the Hungarian National Gallery as an Independent Institution|url=http://www.thearttribune.com/Information-on-the-Proposed.html|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=The Art Tribune|date=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 25, 2011 the Hungarian Section of the [[International Association of Art Critics]] (AICA) published their similar standpoint regarding the issue and also supported the on–line petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Hungarian Section of the International Association of Art Critics (AICA)|title=Standpoint|url=http://aica.hu/mng_allasfoglalas.html|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baán dismissed these criticisms by reminding the Hungarian members of AICA that he was hired to conduct the necessary impact studies and hold discussions with key stakeholders in the next two years in order to address their concerns. He also stressed that the National Gallery would not cease to exist, but only that its collections would be relocated to return it to its pre–1957 state and give it more prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Múzeumi negyed: a kormánybiztos visszautasítja a félremagyarázást|url=http://www.stop.hu/kultura/muzeumi-negyed-a-kormanybiztos-visszautasitja-a-felremagyarazast/953219/|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=Stop.hu|date=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar places worldwide==

Despite all of the challenges and the opposition to the planned Budapest Museum Quarter, creating unified spaces is not unheard of, as there are other major cities worldwide which have successfully created cultural and tourist centers by clustering museums and other similar attractions in one location.

===Europe===
The [[Museumplein]] of Amsterdam — a spacious square with a pond and park frequently used for outdoor festivals and events — lies in the heart of the museum quarter in [[Amsterdam]] surrounded by the [[Rijksmuseum]], the [[Van Gogh Museum]], the [[Stedelijk]] and the [[Concertgebouw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museumplein|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/locations/museumplein/1ef2bca0-e72c-5602-e1f75b6471e3f3b0|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five institutions that are all part of the [[Berlin State Museums]] are located on the northern half of an island in the [[Spree River]] in [[Berlin]], Germany and make up what is referred to as [[Museum Island]].

More than a dozen museums in [[Frankfurt]], Germany are clustered along the banks of the Main River in an area known as the [[Museumsufer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museumsufer Frankfurt|url=http://www.kultur-frankfurt.de/portal/en/Museums/MuseumEmbankmentFrankfurt/1503/0/0/0/1441.aspx|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opened in 2001, the [[Museumsquartier|Museum Quarter in Vienna]] is one of the world's largest complexes for modern art and culture, encompassing nine permanent museums, exhibition halls, and creativity space for the dozens of culture initiatives based in the area.

The [[Dallas arts district|Dallas Arts District]] was proposed in 1978 and the first major museum to be located in the northeast corner of downtown was the [[Dallas Museum of Art]], opened in 1984. Since then, the Morton H. [[Meyerson Symphony Center]], the [[Crow Collection of Asian Art]], the [[Nasher Sculpture Center]], the [[Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts]], and the [[AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center]] have all been moved or newly built in the area.

==Related issues==
In addition to criticism surrounding the proposed Museum Quarter and the recent changes in leadership for key Hungarian cultural institutions, there are several other significant issues that affect the country's [[cultural heritage management]].

===Kossuth Square===
A new controversy has erupted over the plans to restore the [[Kossuth Square]] in front of the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Parliament building]]. The changes would include the removal of all monuments added since 1945 and replacing them with pre–1944 sculptures. In this plan, a 1980 sculpture of one of the greatest Hungarian poets, [[Attila József]] would be replaced by a monument of one–time prime minister [[Gyula Andrássy]]. Not everyone is overly worried about the government's actions, though. For example, artist Miklós Szűts believes that "the government might make symbolic gestures, like the paintings they commissioned, but they don’t have a major effect in reality.”&lt;ref name="Michalska"/&gt; However, the Socialist opposition planted a tree on Earth Day 2012 at the end of the square in protest of the government's undemocratic actions of modifying the space "without asking the people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Socialists plant tree to protest reconstruction of area around parliament|url=http://www.politics.hu/20120423/socialists-plant-tree-to-protest-reconstruction-of-area-around-parliament/|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=Politics.hu|date=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the statues of [[Kossuth Square]] being in danger, the fate of the [[Ethnographic Museum (Budapest)|Ethnographic Museum]] that is across from the Parliament building is also uncertain because the newly reinstated Hungarian Supreme Court (Kúria) has recently expressed interest in getting its former building back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grabow|first=Elisabeth K.|title=Taking a stand on Kossuth square|url=http://www.budapesttimes.hu/2012/03/02/taking-a-stand-on-kossuth-square/|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Budapest Times|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the local newspaper Népszava, just moving the museum, as well as the [[Institute of Political History]] that also occupies the same building, would cost at least 5 billion [[Hungarian forint|HUF]], but constructing new premises for both would take at least 15 billion HUF, if not double the amount".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MTI|title=Tízmilliárdokat emésztene fel a Kúria áthelyezése (in Hungarian)

===Natural History Museum===
In mid–2011, the [[Hungarian Natural History Museum]] was threatened with eviction from its building (known as the Ludovika Campus), which it received after the fall of communism in 1989. The government wanted to turn the premises into a university for the military or police, similar to its function prior to 1945, and thereby relocate the 70 staff and 10 million artifacts into a yet undecided space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turner|first=Marian|title=Hungarian natural history under threat|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110607/full/474139a.html|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=Nature|date=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after this news, the government's Office of Public Affairs issued a joint press release with the museum that addressed the issue. They explained that in spite of two decades of effort, the museum still operates in three separate locations. Additionally, the move of the proposed National Civil Servant University into unutilized space in the Ludovika Campus would make it possible for the museum to receive additional space elsewhere, thereby improving its current situation by reducing the number of sites where it operates. The museum would keep the current space in the Ludovika's former stables and the underground rooms that it uses. The museum's leadership would also take part in the preparatory work regarding the renovations of the Ludovika Campus. Long–term plans involve moving the [[Hungarian Natural History Museum]] to the completed Museum Quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sajtoiroda|title=A Közigazgatási és Igazságügyi Minisztérium és a Magyar Természettudományi Múzeum sajtóközleménye a Magyar Természettudományi Múzeum elhelyezéséröl|url=http://www.mttm.hu/modules/Kozmuvelodes/sajtokozlemeny.jpg|work=Press Release|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hopp Southeast Asia Museum===
A private collection exhibiting almost 1,000 artifacts opened on [[Andrássy út]] in September 2011 as part of the new [[Zelnik István Southeast Asian Gold Museum|Southeast Asian Gold Museum]].  One source of contention among its critics is that the Ministry of Culture approved the title of "museum" without the usual requirements for records of the origin of the exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rózsa|first=Mihály|title=L'ouverture du Musée Zelnik|url=http://www.lepetitjournal.com/culture-budapest/85596-culture-louverture-du-musee-zelnik.html|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Le Petit Journal (in French)|date=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection is both complimentary to and competition of the existing Ferenc Hopp Southeast Asian Museum in Budapest, which the owner and curator of the new Gold Museum István Zelnik had been interested in acquiring since 2008. However, the leadership of the latter (which belongs under the umbrella of the Budapest [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]]) blocked his advances. Currently, the future of both the Hopp Museum and its sister institution the György Ráth Museum is uncertain. Due to financial constraints, they are both only open for half–days on Friday through Sunday. There are also rumors within the Hungarian press that both museums are due to close on March 31, 2012 and that their collections are to be permanently transferred to the Museum of Applied Arts as a response to the Hopp Museum's previous bids for independent status under the auspices of the National Trust for Monuments [http://www.nemzetimuemlek.hu/ (MNG)].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamvay|first=Péter|title=A Hoppnak annyi?|url=http://www.nepszava.hu/articles/article.php?id=520094&amp;referer_id=friss#null|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=Népszava Online|date=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Krásna Hôrka Castle===
While [[Krásna Hôrka Castle]] is a National Cultural Monument of the [[Slovak Republic]], it was built and inhabited by ethnic Hungarian families and was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] until 1918. However, a massive blaze on March 10, 2012 destroyed much of the building and up to 10% of its historical collections.&lt;ref "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinky.cz/zahranicni/evropa/261533-slovensky-hrad-krasna-horka-shorel-kvuli-dvema-detem-s-cigaretou.html?ref=zpravy-dne|title=Slovenský hrad Krásná Hôrka shořel kvůli dvěma dětem s cigaretou|last=Šubrt|first=Pavel |date=11 March 2012|publisher=Novinky.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fidesz's commitment to the preservation of Hungary's cultural heritage may be tested based on their response to the request for aid from the Hungarian Coalition Party of Slovakia to rebuild the thirteenth-century fortress, but the initial statement of the Hungarian Prime Minister was that the nation is prepared to assist with saving this priceless cultural asset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tizenévesek okozhatták a krasznahorkai tüzet|url=http://index.hu/kulfold/2012/03/11/tizenevesek_okozhattak_a_krasznahorkai_tuzet/|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=Index.hu|date=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burbery Mortgage Finance &amp; Savings Ltd v Hindsbank Holdings Ltd''' [1989] 1 NZLR 356 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding [[promissory estoppel]], and the ground that their needs to be a pre existing legal relationship before this doctrine applies. This case also is notable that it extends legal relationships to include creditors to the same entity.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=69-70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hindsbank owned a farm in [[South Canterbury]], with [[Equiticorp]] holding a first ranking debenture over the company assets. Burbery had a first ranking charge over the farm machinery of Hindsbank.

Hindsbank got into financial difficulty, resulting Burbery trying to repossess the farm equipment, as well as Equiticorp appointing a receiver.

The receiver discussed over the phone with Burbery, that as he was instructed to sell the farm, he asked Burbery to not repossess the farm machinery. Burbery alleged that the receiver also said that this was to maximise the sale proceeds for the farm, although the receiver denied ever saying this.

As a result of this conversation, Burbery instructed their repossession agent to cease seizing the machinery.

However, unknown to Burbery at the time, the receiver had discovered that they could legally seize the machinery under a [[Distraint|Warrant to Distrain]] for unpaid rent. The receiver subsequently sold the machinery and refused to pay any of the sale proceeds to Burbery.

A less than impressed Burbery sued Hindsbank to recover the sale proceeds.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal extended the necessary pre existing legal relationship to include parties that were creditors to the same company. The court ruled that the only reasonable conclusion of the conversation that it would not affect Burbery's security and that if Hindsbank wanted to distrain the farm machinery, equity would require that Hindsbank give Burbery reasonable notice of this. As a result, promissory estoppel applied, and the receiver was ordered to pay to Burbery the proceeds from the machinery sale.

The '''COPINE Scale''' is a rating system created in Ireland and used in the United Kingdom to categorise the severity of images of child sex abuse.&lt;ref&gt;The legal definition of a child in this context is any person who is under the age of 18. http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1969/46/section/1&lt;/ref&gt; The scale was developed by staff at the COPINE ("Combating Paedophile Information Networks in Europe") project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071129132438/http://copine.ie/ COPINE Project News and Upcoming Events (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt; The COPINE Project was founded in 1997, and is based in the Department of Applied Psychology, [[University College Cork]], Ireland.

== Use of the COPINE scale ==

===Therapeutic===
The COPINE scale was originally developed for therapeutic psychological purposes. 

More specifically, it is used to distinguish between [[Child modeling (erotic)|child erotica]] and [[child pornography]].

Professor [[Max Taylor (psychologist)|Max Taylor]], one of the academics working for the COPINE project, stated: "The significance of this distinction is to emphasise the potential sexual qualities of a whole range of kinds of photographs (and other material as well) not all of which may meet [[obscenity]] criteria."&lt;ref name='Taylor Typology 2001'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Typology of Paedophile Picture Collections | journal = The Police Journal | year = 2001 | first = Max | last = Taylor |author2=Holland, G |author3=Quayle, E. | volume = 74 | pages = 97–107 | url = http://www.popcenter.org/problems/child_pornography/PDFs/Taylor_etal_2001.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial===
In the late 1990s, the COPINE project at the University College Cork, in cooperation with the [[Paedophile Unit]] of the London Metropolitan Police, developed a typology to categorize child abuse images for use in both research and law enforcement.&lt;ref name=copine/&gt; The ten-level typology was based on analysis of images available on websites and internet newsgroups. Other researchers have adopted similar ten-level scales.&lt;ref name=taylor2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor |first=M. |author2=Quayle, E. |author3=Holland, G.  |year=2001 |title=Child Pornography, the Internet and Offending |publisher=ISUMA |journal=The Canadian Journal of Policy Research |volume= 2 |pages=94–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The SAP scale===
The 2002 case of ''Regina v. Oliver'' in the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inquisition21.com/pca_1978/reference/oliver2002.html R v Oliver] case summary&lt;/ref&gt; established a scale by which indecent images of children could be "graded". The five point scale, established by the [[Sentencing Advisory Panel]] for England and Wales and adopted in 2002, is known as the '''SAP scale'''. It is based on COPINE terminology and is often mistakenly referred to as such.&lt;ref name=evidence&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.1gis.co.uk/img/evidence.pdf|title=Understanding Computer Evidence|last=Vella|first=Paul|work=Evidence Matters|access-date=2011-02-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902210908/http://www.1gis.co.uk/img/evidence.pdf#|archive-date=2011-09-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class="wikitable" style="font-weight:normal;text-align:left;"
|+ '''The SAP Scale'''
|-! Level Number !! Level Title !! Description
|-
! 1
| Nudity or erotic posing with no sexual activity
|-
! 2
| Sexual activity between children, or solo masturbation by a child
|-
! 3
| Non-penetrative sexual activity between adult(s) and child(ren)
|-
! 4
| Penetrative sexual activity between child(ren) and adult(s)
|-
! 5
| Sadism or bestiality
|-
|}

The SAP document gives a detailed explanation of how the COPINE scale was adapted. It also states that the COPINE scale was intended for therapeutic use and not designed for use in court. Examination of the categories will show that categories 2–5 of the SAP scale obviously correspond to categories 7–10 of the COPINE scale. Category 1 of the SAP scale seems to correspond vaguely to categories 4–6 of the COPINE scale. COPINE category 1 (indicative) was left off the SAP scale because "images of this nature would not be classed as indecent." The board found COPINE categories 2 &amp; 3 to be disputable as to whether or not they can be classified as indecent.&lt;ref name=evidence /&gt;

=== Sexual Offences Definitive Guideline ===
On 1 April 2014, a new scale, replacing the SAP scale, was adopted for sentencing in England and Wales for crimes relating to indecent images of children, put into place by page 75 of the Sentencing Council's Sexual Offences Definitive Guideline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.iwf.org.uk/assets/media/hotline/Sentencing%20Councils%20Sexual%20Offences%20Definitive%20Guideline%20April%202014.pdf |title=Sentencing Council - Sexual Offences Definitive Guideline |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-08-18 |website = iwf.org.uk |publisher = Sentencing Council |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.iwf.org.uk/hotline/assessment-levels|title = Assessment Levels|accessdate = 2014-08-18 |website = IWF |publisher =[[Internet Watch Foundation]] (IWF) |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Christherre-Chronik''''' (named after its opening words, "Christ the Lord") is a 13th-century world chronicle from Thüringen, written in [[Middle High German]] rhyming couplets.  It was written by a churchman in the service of [[Henry III, Margrave of Meissen]], and may be seen as attempting a spiritual answer to the courtly world chronicle of [[Rudolf von Ems]].  The work begins with the creation of the world and was apparently intended to follow world history until the poet's own day, but it was never finished.  It breaks off during the account of the book of judges, and in the manuscripts it is continued with text from other chronicles, including (ironically) that of Rudolf, and also sometimes the ''Weltchronik'' of [[Jans der Enikel]].

There is still no edition of this text.  Excerpts with English translations can be found in: Graeme Dunphy (ed.), ''History as Literature: German World Chronicles of the Thirteenth Century in Verse''. Kalamazoo 2003.

'''Ciao''' was a European-based online-shopping portal with websites in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]] and [[Sweden]]. In February 2008, the company launched an American version of the site, Ciao.com.&lt;ref name="Ciao.com"&gt;[http://www.csestrategies.com/cse/2008/02/ciao-us-launche.html Ciao.com Launch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913222058/http://www.csestrategies.com/cse/2008/02/ciao-us-launche.html |date=2008-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site provided a forum where registered users could write reviews and give their opinions on a wide variety of products to help others make decisions.  These reviews were available to the general public to help consumers, but also rated by other Ciao users on their usefulness on a scale ranging from exceptional to off-topic. Up to December 2017, when a review was read by a member, the author had money added to their account. Members could also receive money through online surveys and referring friends. On 27 November 2017, Ciao announced that from 1 December all payments would be stopped. In February 2018, Ciao was closed down. Ciao was free to sign up for.

As well as offering reviews, the site also provided price comparison (working with merchants and agencies who provide data feeds) and allowed the user to click through and purchase products.

Ciao claims that it reached an audience of 28.4 million monthly unique visitors (ComScore, January 2013) in Europe.

==Microsoft Purchases Ciao==
[[Microsoft]] made an offer of $486 million in late August 2008 to purchase Greenfield Online, the owner of Ciao GmbH and Ciao, Inc.&lt;ref name="Microsoft"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSBNG33694720080831 Purchase By Microsoft], Microsoft buys Greenfield Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives from Microsoft said the purchase was primarily made to boost the company's Internet search and e-commerce business in Europe.&lt;ref name="E-commerce"&gt;[https://www.gadgetsnow.com/tech-news/Microsoft-buys-ciao-com/articleshow/3425391.cms Microst Purchase Ciao] Microsoft bought Ciao to improve its e-commerce.&lt;/ref&gt;

==LeGuide Group Acquires Ciao==

Since the acquisition in March 2012, Ciao strengthens the portfolio of [[:fr:LeGuide.com Group|LeGuide Group]] (listed on Alternext board of NYSE Euronext Paris – ISIN code: FR0010146092), founded in 1998 and operating in 14 European countries through a multi-site strategy of online shopping guides, comparison websites, shopping search engines and platforms for consumer ratings.

There are many popular computer data '''[[archive format]]s''' for creating and maintaining [[archive files]].  The tables below '''compare many popular archive formats'''.

==Features==
The table compares various features column-by-column below:

===Purpose===
Archive formats are used for backups, mobility, and [[archiving]]. Many archive formats  [[data compression|compress]] the data to consume less storage space and result in quicker transfer times as the same data is represented by fewer bytes. Another benefit is that files are combined into one archive file which has less overhead for managing or transferring.

There are numerous [[compression algorithms]] available to losslessly compress archived data and some algorithms work better (smaller archive or faster compression) with particular data types.

Archive formats are also used by [[Unix-like operating system|most operating systems]] to [[package (package management system)|package]] software for easier distribution and installation than [[EXE (file format)|binary executables]].

===Filename extension===
The [[DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating systems required filenames to include an extension (of at least one, and typically 3 characters) to identify the file type and use. Filename extensions must be unique for each type of file. Many [[operating systems]] identify a file's type from its contents without the need for an extension in its name. However, the use of three-character extensions has been embraced as a useful and efficient shorthand for identifying file types.

===Integrity check===
Archive files are often stored on [[magnetic media]], which is subject to [[computer data storage|data storage]] errors. Early [[Magnetic tape data storage|tape media]] had a higher rate of errors than they do today. Many archive formats contain extra error-correction information to detect storage or transmission errors, and the software used to read the archive files contains [[logic]] to detect and possibly correct errors.

===Recovery record===
Many archive formats contain redundant data embedded in the files in order to detect data storage or transmission errors, and the software used to read the archive files contains logic to detect and correct errors.

===Encryption===
In order to protect the data being stored or transferred from being read if intercepted, many archive formats include the capability to encrypt the data.  There are multiple mathematical algorithms available to encrypt data.

==Comparison==

===Containers and compression ===

==== Notes ====
{{note|1|1}} While the original [[tar (file format)|tar]] format uses the [[ASCII]] character encoding, current implementations use the [[UTF-8]] (Unicode) encoding, which is backwards compatible with ASCII.&lt;br/&gt;
{{note|2|2}} Supports the external Parchive program (par2).&lt;br /&gt;
{{note|3|3}} From 3.20 release RAR can store modification, creation and last access time with the precision up to 0.0000001 second (= 0.1 µs). [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718054505/http://www.win-rar.com/index.php?id=24&amp;kb_article_id=85] [https://archive.is/20130209062109/http://www.winrar-tr.com/WinRAR/Help/ENG/html/HELPSwTS.htm]&lt;br /&gt;
{{note|a4|4}} The PAQ family (with its lighter weight derivative LPAQ) went through many revisions, each revision suggested its own extension. For example: ".paq9a".&lt;br /&gt;
{{note|5|5}} WIM can store the [[ciphertext]] of encrypted files on an [[NTFS]] volume, but such files can only by decrypted if an administrator extracts the file to an NTFS volume, and the decryption key is available (typically from the file's original owner on the same Windows installation). Microsoft has also distributed some download versions of the Windows operating system as encrypted WIM files, but via an external encryption process and not a feature of WIM.

=== Notes ===

{{note|c1|1}} Compression is not a built-in feature of the formats, however, the resulting archive can be compressed with any algorithm of choice. Several implementations include functionality to do this automatically&lt;br/&gt;
{{note|c2|2}} Most implementations can optionally produce a self-extracting executable&lt;br/&gt;
{{note|c3|3}} Per-file compression with [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], [[lzo]], [[xz]], [[lzma]] (as opposed to compressing the whole archive). An individual can choose not to compress already compressed filenames based on their suffix as well.

The '''''Deutsches Geschlechterbuch''''', until 1943 known as the '''''Genealogisches Handbuch bürgerlicher Familien''''', is a major German genealogical handbook of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] or [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] families. It is the bourgeois and patrician equivalent of the ''[[Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels]]'' and the former ''[[Almanach de Gotha]]''. It includes genealogies and coats of arms of the included families. The ''Genealogisches Handbuch bürgerlicher Familien'' was started in 1889 and prior to 1943, 119 volumes covering around 1,200 families were published under the original title. From 1956, the series were continued under the title ''Deutsches Geschlechterbuch''. In 2007, the 219th and latest volume was published. In total, around 4,000 families have been covered.

The ''Hamburgisches Geschlechterbuch'', comprising 17 volumes on the [[Hanseaten (class)|Hanseatic]] families of Hamburg, is an integral part of the work, and is regarded as the most comprehensive reference work of its kind on a single city.&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard von Marchthaler: ''Die Bedeutung des Hamburger Geschlechterbuchs für Hamburgs Bevölkerungskunde und Geschichte'', in: ''Hamburgisches Geschlechterbuch'', Bd. 9, Limburg an der Lahn 1961, S. XXIII&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication has been highly influential and inspired several similar publications, such as ''[[Nederland's Patriciaat]]''. To some extent it corresponds to ''[[Burke's Landed Gentry]]'' in the United Kingdom, although it could also be said to be the equivalent of ''[[Burke's Peerage]]'' in its coverage of [[Hanseaten (class)|Hanseatic]] and patrician families who comprised the highest class in the former city-republics.

The '''Douen''' is a mythological entity from [[Trinidad and Tobago]] folklore. It is believed that they are the lost souls of children who have not yet been baptized or christened. Their most recognized characteristic is their feet are said to be backwards, with the heel facing the front and the knees are backwards, too. If they hear a child's name, then they will call to the child in a parent's voice and try to lure the child into the forest. They wear a big, floppy straw hat to hide the fact that they have no face except for a small mouth to speak with. Largely mischievous, they play pranks on people, raid gardens, and seem to enjoy leading children astray until they are thoroughly lost in the woods.

== The Folklore ==
Douen (pronounced Dwen) are considered to be the ‘lost souls’ of children that were not [[baptized]] or [[infant baptism|christened]] before death. It is said that they are destined to wander the earth eternally while practicing their collection of pranks. Neither male nor female, douens live in the forest, swamps and near rivers in [[Trinidad]] and [[Tobago]]. Their manifestation is that of a naked child never growing more than two or three feet in height. They wear a large floppy straw hat and have an entirely undistinguished face with the exception of a small mouth. The one characteristic that allows them to be recognized as douens are their feet, which are turned backwards with the heel facing forward. Douens roam the land in the pursuit of children that are not yet baptized, or christened in anticipation of luring them away deep into the woods until they are lost. They charm the children when the moon is full and have a mesmerizing whooping sound.  A child who plays with a douen may consider it to be a regular child while the douen slowly but surely leads the child further and further away from the protection of home. Some children may be found the next morning in a precarious arrangement if they are found at all. Douens also have been known to come to people’s houses crying and whimpering for the love of a mother. They feed off cultivated gardens and seem to have a bizarre fondness for water crabs. Often thought to be evil spirits and malevolent creatures, douens do have a good natured side. They have been known to be of assistance to [[Papa Bois]] in the forest when an animal is trapped and injured by imitating animal calls to throw hunters off track. To avert the douens from calling your children into the forest it is said that you should never call a child’s name in open places for the douens will then in turn call the child’s name to attract them away into the forest never to return. There have been actual reports of douen encounters from children in rural areas of Trinidad such as Piparo, Penal and Barrackpore. These spirits have been reported to manifest themselves in the homes of people who have been talking about either the Douen or similar creatures. Reports suggest that open talk summons the creatures or creates a positive pull towards those who look for them. Manifestation in one's home could either be by seeing images of a child or by childish-seeming "pranks" being played on individuals. These creatures once called upon, can be very tricky to get rid of as they tend to be very clingy like real children would be. Natives report that religious intervention is typically called upon to remove the creatures from one's home.

== Origins of Folklore in Trinidad and Tobago ==
Trinidad and Tobago folklore is primarily of African foundation, with French, Spanish and English influences. Religious or semi-religious cults of African origin have undeniably contributed much to the Island's folklore.  Many of the supernatural folklore characters are identical with those of African deities. It is exceedingly complicated to draw a line between the stern religious elements and what may be described as traditions. Nevertheless, in the African tradition, stories were meant to instill values in the children.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Eric (1993). ''History of the People of Trinidad &amp; Tobago,A&amp;b Publishers Group&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* Douen feature heavily in ''[[Lost and Found (Haven)|Lost and Found]]'', a [[Haven (season 4)|season 4]] episode of the [[Syfy]] television show ''[[Haven (TV series)|Haven]]''.
* Douen are mentioned 12 times in [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] &amp; Anna Waterhouse's [[novel]] ''Mycroft Holmes''.
* Douen are mentioned several times in [[Wayne Gerard Trotman]]'s [[novel]] ''Kaya Abaniah and the Father of the Forest''.
* "Douen" is used to describe a sentient species on another planet in [[Nalo Hopkinson]]'s novel ''[[Midnight Robber]]'' (Warner Aspect, 2000). The human characters explain that, on foreign planets, douen is used as a threat to frighten children: that these creatures are dead children arisen from the grave.

'''Edward F. Gossett'''&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt; (January 15, 1930 – January 21, 1985),&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt; better known as '''Eddie Graham''', was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He was also the promoter and booker for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] and President of the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]] in the 1970s.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Texas===
Gossett started wrestling in 1947 in [[Texas]] at the age of 17 after being trained by Clarence "Cowboy" Luttrall.&lt;ref name=top100&gt;John Molinaro, ''The Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time'', (Winding Stair Press: 2002), page 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt; He was sometimes billed as the brother of [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|"Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers]] under the name of '''Rip Rogers'''.&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt; He lost a loser-leaves-town match to Pepper Gomez in May 1958 in Texas.&lt;ref name=wwebio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/eddiegraham|title=Eddie Graham bio|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tag team wrestling===
In June 1958, he changed his ring name to '''Eddie Graham''' and was billed as the brother of [[Dr. Jerry Graham]] and [[Grady Johnson|"Crazy" Luke Graham]].  Jerry and Eddie were a very successful [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] [[tag team]] on the east coast of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=top100/&gt; They had popular feuds with teams such as [[the Fabulous Kangaroos]], the Bastien Brothers, [[Mark Lewin]] and [[Don Curtis]], and [[Antonino Rocca]] and [[Miguel Pérez (wrestler)|Miguel Pérez]].&lt;ref name=top100/&gt; They held the [[WWWF United States Tag Team Championship|NWA United States Tag Team Championship ''(Northeast version)]] together in [[WWE|Capitol Wrestling]] (the forerunner of [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]) four times, winning the belts three times in victories over Lewin and Curtis, and once against [[Red Bastien|Red]] and Lou Bastien.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wwf/wwf-us-t.html NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Capitol version) at Wrestling-Titles.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida===
In the spring of 1960, Eddie left the team and went to the [[National Wrestling Alliance]]'s territory in [[Florida]] to wrestle. While there, in 1966, he had a feud with [[Boris Malenko|Professor Boris Malenko]].&lt;ref name=top100/&gt;

Eddie took over booking and promoting for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] in 1971. He wrestled with his son, [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]], until 1977, when he retired from the ring due to health problems. He made a one-shot return to the ring for one final match in 1979 when he defeated [[Killer Khan]] by pinfall after the referee was knocked out and subsequent interference by [[Mr. Hito]] and [[Kazuo Sakurada]] on Khan's behalf was fought off by Mike Graham and [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|Ray Stevens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|rZDG7s9C2Ms|Eddie Graham vs. Killer Khan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NWA President===
He was the President of the NWA from 1976 to 1978, thanks in part to [[Gordon Solie]] and [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]. Graham was absent as NWA President in 1977 and 1978 due to serious health problems he suffered from, and was forced to step down as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harleyrace.com/programs/kc81778.htm |title=Kansas City Wrestling program, August 17, 1978 |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210028/http://www.harleyrace.com/programs/kc81778.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
He was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on March 29, 2008. He was inducted posthumously by Dusty Rhodes, while his son, [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]], accepted the honor on behalf of his father.

==Personal life==
Graham was born in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="OWOW"/&gt;

In 1968, Graham was lacing his boots in the locker room and a 75-lb steel window fell on his head, detaching both of his [[retina]]s and causing him an injury that required three hundred stitches.&lt;ref name=top100/&gt; The [[Florida Legislature]] awarded him $23,000 for the incident. According to [[Jim Wilson (wrestler)|Jim Wilson]] in his book ''Chokehold'', Graham's eyesight was poor because of [[Blading (professional wrestling)|blade jobs]], and because he needed surgery to correct the problem and could not afford the money, he had some wrestlers tamper with the window in order to pass it off as though it was the responsibility of the building. This allegation is disputed by eyewitnesses. Also, "blading" does not cause eye damage according to noted optometrist Dr. Robert W. McCullough and other eye doctors. Due to the injury, Graham was unable to wrestle for fifteen months.&lt;ref name=top100/&gt;

He remained as the promoter in Florida until January 21, 1985, when he committed suicide by gunshot after a lifelong battle with [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name=top100/&gt;

The '''European Business Register (EBR)''' is a network of trade registers kept by the registration authorities in most of the [[Europe]]an countries. The EBR is part of the fully integrated approach of the [[European Commission]] in the legislation designed to achieve regulations to promote transparent financial markets and to facilitate free movement of [[company|companies]]. The EBR has served as a starting point of the [[Business Register Interoperability Throughout Europe]] (BRITE) project which developed an interoperability solution [[BRIS]] for Business Registers to interact across the [[European Union]]. BRIS makes it possible to obtain comparable, official [[company]] information from the countries connected to the network.

The EBR is at the moment composed of 26 partners and delivers company information from 25 [[Europe]]an countries.

Amongst others the European Business registers contains remarks about:
*legal name of a [[company (law)|company]]
*[[Registered office]]
*people representing the [[company (law)|company]] ([[Managing Director]], [[Board of Directors]], holders of [[Proxy voting|Proxy]]) 
*subscribed [[Financial capital|capital]] if any.
Many scams circulate offering inclusion in the European Business register against payment of a hidden fee&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uia.org/directory-scams|title=Directory Scams Fraud Alert {{!}} Union of International Associations|website=www.uia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, these do not refer to the official register though; inclusion in the European Business Register is free of charge and mostly automatically done by registering a company within one of the partnering countries.

'''Folk etymology''' or '''reanalysis''' – sometimes called '''pseudo-etymology''', '''popular etymology''', or '''analogical reformation''' – is a change in a word or phrase resulting from the replacement of an unfamiliar form by a more familiar one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1 |folk-etymology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sihler2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sihler|first=Andrew|title=Language History: An introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXlAYlCSoZQC|year=2000|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=90-272-8546-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trask2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trask|first=Robert Lawrence|authorlink=Larry Trask|title=The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHeGzQ8wuLQC|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-57958-218-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form or the meaning of an archaic, foreign, or otherwise unfamiliar word is reanalyzed as resembling more familiar words or [[morpheme]]s. [[Rebracketing]] is a form of folk etymology in which a word is broken down or "bracketed" into a new set of supposed elements. [[Back-formation]], creating a new word by removing or changing parts of an existing word, is often based on folk etymology.

The term ''folk etymology'' is a [[loan translation]] from [[German language|German]] '''''Volksetymologie''''', coined by  [[Ernst Förstemann]] in 1852.&lt;ref name="Forstemann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Förstemann|first=Ernst|editor=Adalbert Kuhn|title=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiete des Deutschen, Griechischen und Lateinischen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6kMNAAAAYAAJ|year=1852|publisher=F. Dümmler.|chapter=Ueber Deutsche volksetymologie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk etymology is a [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] process in [[historical linguistics]], [[language change]], and [[social relation|social interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.[http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/ENGINEERING.pdf ''''Etymythological''' Othering' and the Power of 'Lexical Engineering' in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. A Socio-Philo(sopho)logical Perspective], by [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] in ''Explorations in the Sociology of Language and Religion'' (2006), ed. by Tope Omoniyi &amp; [[Joshua A. Fishman]], Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp.&amp;nbsp;237–258.&lt;/ref&gt; Reanalysis of a word's history or original form can affect its spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. This is frequently seen in relation to [[loanword]]s or words that have become archaic or obsolete.

Examples of words created or changed through folk etymology include the English dialectal form [[wikt:sparrowgrass|''sparrowgrass'']], originally from Greek {{lang|el|ἀσπάραγος}} ("[[asparagus]]") remade by analogy to the more familiar words ''sparrow'' and ''grass'',&lt;ref name="Anttila1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anttila|first=Raimo|title=Historical and Comparative Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2C25_9m7U-AC|year=1989|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=90-272-3556-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the word ''[[hamburger|burger]]'', originally from ''[[Hamburg]]'' + ''-er'' ("thing connected with"), but understood as ''ham'' + ''burger''.&lt;ref name="Shukla"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shukla|first1=Shaligram|last2=Connor-Linton|first2=Jeff|editor=R. Fasold and J. Connor-Linton|title=An Introduction to Language and Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlzthEZGkmsC|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84768-1|chapter=Language change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Productive force ==
The technical term "folk etymology" refers to a change in the form of a word caused by erroneous popular beliefs about its etymology. The English word is a translation of the [[German language|German]] term ''Volksetymologie'', coined by [[Ernst Förstemann]]. Förstemann noted that in addition to scientific etymology based on careful study in [[philology]], there exist scholarly but often unsystematic accounts, as well as popular accounts for the history of linguistic forms.&lt;ref name="Forstemann"/&gt; Until academic linguists developed comparative philology and described the laws underlying [[sound changes]], the derivation of words was a matter mostly of guess-work. Speculation about the original form of words in turn feeds back into the development of the word and thus becomes a part of a new etymology.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Etymology|volume=9|pages=864-865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Believing a word to have a certain origin, people begin to pronounce, spell, or otherwise use the word in a manner appropriate to that perceived origin.  This popular etymologizing has had a powerful influence on the forms which words take. Examples in English include ''[[crayfish]]'' or ''crawfish'', which are not historically related to ''fish'' but come from [[Middle English]] ''crevis'', [[cognate]] with French ''écrevisse''. Likewise ''chaise lounge'', from the original French ''chaise longue'' ("long chair"), has come to be associated with the word ''lounge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pyles |first1=Thomas |last2=Algeo |first2=John |title=The Origins and Development of the English Language |edition=4th |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=0030970547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Varieties ==
{{further|Rebracketing|Back-formation}}
[[Rebracketing]] is a process of [[language change]] in which parts of a word that appear to be meaningful (such as *''ham'' in ''hamburger'') are mistaken as elements of the word's etymology (in this case, the word ''[[ham]]''). Rebracketing functions by reanalyzing the constituent parts of a word. For example, the [[Old French]] word ''orenge'' ("orange tree") comes from [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|rtl=yes|النرنج }} ''an nāranj'' ("the orange tree"), with the initial ''n'' of ''nāranj'' understood as part of the [[Article (grammar)|article]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 2013 | title = orange ''n''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''adj''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary online | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | url =http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/132163 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[back-formation]] a new word is created, often by removing elements thought to be [[affix]]es. For example, [[Italian language|Italian]] ''pronuncia'' ("pronunciation; accent") is derived from the verb ''pronunciare'' ("to pronounce; to utter") and English ''edit'' derives from ''editor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5675-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases of back-formation are based on folk etymology.&lt;ref name="Shukla" /&gt;

== Examples in English ==
In linguistic change caused by folk etymology, the form of a word changes so that it better matches its popular rationalisation.  Typically this happens either to unanalyzable foreign words or to compounds where the word underlying one part of the compound becomes obsolete.

=== Loanwords ===
There are many examples of words borrowed from foreign languages, and subsequently changed by folk etymology.

The spelling of many borrowed words reflects folk etymology. For example, ''[[Wikt:andiron|andiron]]'' borrowed from Old French was variously spelled ''aundyre'' or ''aundiren'' in Middle English, but was altered by association with ''iron''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|andiron, n.|year=1884}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Old French loans altered in a similar manner include ''[[belfry (architecture)|belfry]]'' (from ''berfrei'') by association with ''bell'', ''female'' (from ''femelle'') by ''male'', and ''penthouse'' (from ''apentis'') by ''house''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The variant spelling of ''licorice'' as ''[[wikt:liquorice|liquorice]]'' comes from the supposition that it has something to do with liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology |last=Barnhart |first=Robert K. |editor-link=[[Robert Barnhart]] |year=1988 |publisher=H.W. Wilson |isbn=978-0-8242-0745-8|page=593|quote=The development of Late Latin ''liquiritia'' was in part influenced by Latin ''liquēre'' 'to flow', in reference to the process of treating the root to obtain its extract.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo-Norman ''licoris'' (influenced by ''licor'' "liquor") and [[Late Latin]] ''liquirītia'' were respelled for similar reasons, though the ultimate origin of all three is Greek ''{{lang|he|γλυκύρριζα}}'' (glycyrrhiza) "sweet root".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1|liquorice licorice, n.|year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reanalysis of loan words can affect their spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. The word ''cockroach'', for example, was borrowed from Spanish ''cucaracha'' but was assimilated to the existing English words ''cock'' and ''[[Common Roach|roach]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|cockroach, n.|year=1891}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jerusalem artichoke]]'', from Italian ''girasole'', is a kind of sunflower; it is not related to [[artichoke]]s and does not come from Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Artichoke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''forlorn hope'' originally meant "storming party, body of skirmishers"&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, Lesley (ed.). 2002. ''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', vol. 1, A–M. 5th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 1600.&lt;/ref&gt; from Dutch ''verloren hoop'' "lost troop". But confusion with English ''hope'' has given the term an additional meaning of "hopeless venture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|forlorn hope, n.|year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes imaginative stories are created to account for the link between a borrowed word and its popularly assumed sources. The names of the ''[[serviceberry]]'', ''service tree'', and related plants, for instance, come from the Latin name ''[[sorbus]]''. The plants were called ''syrfe'' in Old English, which eventually became ''service''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|serve, n1|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fanciful stories suggest that the name comes from the fact that the trees bloom in spring, a time when circuit-riding preachers resume church services or when funeral services are carried out for people who died during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Small|first=Ernest|title=North American Cornucopia: Top 100 Indigenous Food Plants|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-8594-2|page=597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seemingly plausible but no less speculative etymology accounts for the form of ''[[Welsh rarebit]]'', a dish made of cheese and toasted bread. The earliest known reference to the dish in 1725 called it ''Welsh rabbit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrom|first=John|title=The Private Journal and Literary Remains of John Byrom|year=1854|publisher=Chetham society|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of that name is unknown, but presumably humorous, since the dish contains no rabbit. In 1785 [[Francis Grose]] suggested in ''A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' that the dish is "a Welch rare bit",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grose|first=Francis|title=A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue|year=1785|publisher=S. Hooper|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyVKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the word ''rarebit'' was not common prior to Grose's dictionary. Both versions of the name are in current use; individuals sometimes express strong opinions concerning which version is correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Welsh rabbit, Welsh rarebit|encyclopedia=Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|page=952|year=1994|isbn=978-0-87779-132-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obsolete forms ===
When a word or other form becomes obsolete, words or phrases containing the obsolete portion may be reanalyzed and changed.

Some [[compound word]]s from [[Old English]] were reanalyzed in Middle or Modern English when one of the constituent words fell out of use. Examples include ''[[wikt:bridegroom|bridegroom]]'' from Old English ''[[wikt:brydguma|brydguma]]'' "bride-man". The word ''[[wikt:gome|gome]]'' "man" from Old English ''[[wikt:guma|guma]]'' fell out of use during the sixteenth century and the compound was eventually reanalyzed with the Modern English word ''[[wikt:groom|groom]]'' "male servant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Groom}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar reanalysis caused ''[[wikt:sandblind|sandblind]]'', from Old English ''sāmblind'' "half-blind" with a once-common prefix ''sām-'' "semi-", to be respelled as though it is related to ''sand''. The word ''island'' derives from Old English ''igland''. The modern spelling with the letter ''s'' is the result of comparison with the synonym ''[[wikt:isle|isle]]'' from Old French and ultimately Latin ''insula'', though the Old French and Old English words are not historically related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|title=A Dictionary of English Etymology: E - P|year=1862|publisher=Trübner|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, the spelling of ''[[wikt:wormwood|wormwood]]'' was likely affected by comparison with ''wood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|wormwood|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smythe Palmer|first=Abram|title=Folk-etymology: A Dictionary of Verbal Corruptions Or Words Perverted in Form Or Meaning, by False Derivation Or Mistaken Analogy|year=1882|publisher=Johnson Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|449}}

The phrase ''[[wikt:curry favor|curry favour]]'', meaning to flatter, comes from Middle English ''curry favel'', "[[horse grooming|groom]] a [[chestnut horse]]". This was an [[allusion]] to a fourteenth century French morality poem, ''Roman de Fauvel'', about a chestnut-colored horse who corrupts men through duplicity. The phrase was reanalyzed in early Modern English by comparison to ''favour'' as early as 1510.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Gary|year=2017|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: 'Curry favour'|work=Phrase Finder|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/curry-favour.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Words need not completely disappear before their compounds are reanalyzed. The word ''[[wikt:shamefaced|shamefaced]]'' was originally ''[[wikt:shamefast|shamefast]]''. The original meaning of ''fast'' "fixed in place" still exists but mainly in frozen expressions such as ''stuck fast'', ''hold fast'', and ''[[wikt:play fast and loose|play fast and loose]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The songbird ''[[wheatear]]'' or ''white-ear'' is a back-formation from Middle English ''whit-ers'' "white arse", referring to the prominent white rump found in most species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=White-ear|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/white%E2%80%93ear |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both ''white'' and ''arse'' are common in Modern English, the folk etymology may be [[euphemism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Wheatear |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wheatear |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reanalysis of archaic or obsolete forms can lead to changes in meaning as well. The original meaning of ''[[hangnail]]'' referred to a [[Corn (medicine)|corn]] on the foot.&lt;ref name="MW-hangnail"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=hangnail|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hangnail |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from Old English ''[[wikt:ang-|ang-]]'' + ''[[wikt:nægel|nægel]]'' ("anguished nail" or "compressed spike"), but the spelling and pronunciation were affected by folk etymology in the seventeenth century or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|hangnail|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the word came to be used for a tag of skin or torn [[cuticle]] near a [[fingernail]] or toenail.&lt;ref name="MW-hangnail" /&gt;

== Other languages ==

Several words in [[Medieval Latin]] were subject to folk etymology. For example, the word ''widerdonum'' meaning "reward" was borrowed from [[Old High German]] ''widarlōn'' "repayment of a loan". The ''l{{nbsp}}→{{nbsp}}d'' alteration is due to confusion with Latin ''donum'' "gift".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1 |guerdon|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|157}} Similarly, the word ''baceler'' or ''bacheler'' (related to modern English [[Bachelor#Etymology and historical meanings|''bachelor'']]) referred to a junior knight. It is attested from the eleventh century, though its ultimate origin is uncertain. By the late Middle Ages its meaning was extended to the holder of a university degree inferior to master or doctor.  This was later re-spelled ''baccalaureus'', probably reflecting a false derivation from ''bacca laurea'' "laurel berry", alluding to the possible laurel crown of a poet or conqueror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brachet|first=Auguste|title=An Etymological Dictionary of the French Language: Crowned by the French Academy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvENAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA354|year=1882|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

In the fourteenth or fifteenth century French scholars began to spell the verb ''savoir'' ("to know") as ''sçavoir'' on the false belief it was derived from Latin ''scire'' "to know".  In fact it comes from ''sapere'' "to be wise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singleton|first=David|title=Language and the Lexicon: An Introduction|year=2016|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-83594-3|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian word ''liocorno'' "unicorn" derives from 13th century ''lunicorno'' (''lo'' "the" + ''unicorno'' "unicorn"). Folk etymology based on ''lione'' "lion" altered the spelling and pronunciation. Dialectal ''liofante'' "elephant" was likewise altered from ''elefante'' by association with ''lione''.&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|486}}

The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for "[[hammock]]" is ''hangmat''. It was borrowed from Spanish ''hamaca'' (ultimately from [[Arawak language|Arawak]] ''amàca'') and altered by comparison with ''hangen'' and ''mat'', "hanging mat". German ''Hängematte'' shares this folk etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hängematte|work=Wörterbuch Deutsch|url=http://en.worterbuchdeutsch.com/de/hangematte |date=October 2016|accessdate=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] compound word for "jealous" ''mustasukkainen'' literally means "black-socked" (''musta'' "black" and ''sukka'' "sock"). However, the word is a case of a misunderstood loan translation from Swedish ''svartsjuk'' "black-sick". The Finnish word ''sukka'' fit with a close phonological equivalent to the Swedish ''sjuk''

''[[Names of Istanbul#Islambol|Islambol]]'', a folk etymology meaning "full of Islam", is one of the names of [[Istanbul]] used after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of 1453.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Necdet Sakaoğlu|title=Dünden bugüne İstanbul ansiklopedisi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t51PAQAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Kültür Bakanlığı|language=tr|isbn=978-975-7306-04-7|pages=253–255|chapter=İstanbul'un adları}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|type=Turkish-language|date=February 2017}}

An example from [[Persian language|Persian]] is the word [[shatranj]] (chess), which is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] [[chaturanga]] (2nd century BCE), and after losing the "u" to [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]], becomes ''chatrang'' in [[Middle Persian]] (6th century CE). Today it is sometimes factorized as ''shat'' (hundred) + ''ranj'' (worry / mood), or "a hundred worries".{{citation needed|reason=is this analysis the reason for the segmental change, or is that just passage through Arabic?|date=October 2015}}

[[File:Guangyun Dong Rhyme 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2|The beginning of the first rhyme group of the ''Guangyun'', with first character 東 ("east")]]

The '''''Guangyun''''' ('''''Kuang-yun'''''; {{zh|t={{linktext|廣韻}}|s={{linktext|广韵}} |p=Guǎngyùn|w=Kuang&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-yün&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;|l=''Broad Rimes''}}) is a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[rime dictionary]] that was compiled from 1007 to 1008 under the patronage of [[Emperor Zhenzong of Song]]. Its full name was ''Dà Sòng chóngxiū guǎngyùn'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|大宋重修廣韻}}, literally "Great Song revised and expanded rhymes"). Chen Pengnian ({{lang|zh-Hant|陳彭年}}, 961–1017) and Qiu Yong ({{lang|zh-Hant|邱雍}}) were the chief editors.

The dictionary is a revision and expansion of the influential ''[[Qieyun]]'' rime dictionary of 601, and was itself later revised as the ''[[Jiyun]]''. Until the discovery of an almost complete early 8th century edition of the ''Qieyun'' in 1947, the ''Guangyun'' was the most accurate available account of the ''Qieyun'' phonology, and was heavily used in early work on the reconstruction of [[Middle Chinese]]. It is still used as a major source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | given = William H. | surname = Baxter | author-link = William H. Baxter | title = A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology | location = Berlin | publisher = Mouton de Gruyter | year = 1992 | isbn = 978-3-11-012324-1 | pages = 38–39 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | given = Jerry | surname = Norman | author-link = Jerry Norman (sinologist) | title = Chinese | location = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 978-0-521-29653-3 | page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Guangyun'' has a similar hierarchical organization to the ''Qieyun'':
* The dictionary is split into [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]] in five volumes, two for the Middle Chinese level tone ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|平聲}}}}) and one each for the three oblique tones, rising ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|上聲}}}}), departing ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|去聲}}}}) and [[entering tone|entering]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|入聲}}}}).
* Each tone is split into rimes, with a total of 206 final rimes, increased from 193 in the ''Qieyun''.
* Each rime is divided into groups of homophonous characters, with the pronunciation of each group given by a [[fanqie]] formula.
The dictionary has a total of 26,194 character entries, each containing a brief explanation of the character's meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | surname1 = Teng | given1 = Ssu-yü | given2 = Knight | surname2 = Biggerstaff | title = An Annotated Bibliography of Selected Chinese Reference Works | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Harvard University Press | edition = 3rd | year = 1971 | isbn = 978-0-674-03851-6 | page = 146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Unihan]] database incorporates the "SBGY" (''Songben Guangyun''; "Song edition ''Guangyun''") dataset with 25,334 head-entries for 19,583 characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | given1 = John H. | surname1 = Jenkins | given2 = Richard | surname2 = Cook | title = Unicode Standard Annex #38: Unicode Han Database | publisher = Unicode Consortium | year = 2010 | url = https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr38/tr38-9.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Hanyu Da Zidian}}
The '''''Hanyu Da Cidian''''' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:漢語|漢語]][[wikt:大|大]][[wikt:詞典|詞典]]/[[wikt:汉语|汉语]][[wikt:大|大]][[wikt:词典|词典]]|p=Hànyǔ Dà Cídiǎn|l=Comprehensive Chinese Word Dictionary}}) is the most inclusive available [[Chinese dictionary]]. Lexicographically comparable to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', it has [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] coverage of the [[Chinese language]], and traces usage over three millennia from [[Chinese classic texts]] to modern slang. The chief editor Luo Zhufeng 羅竹風 (1911-1996), along with a team of over 300 scholars and lexicographers, started the enormous task of compilation in 1979. Publication of the thirteen volumes began with first volume in 1986 and ended with the appendix and index volume in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zwbk.org/MyLemmaShow.aspx?zh=zh-tw&amp;lid=209088 《漢語大詞典》]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Hanyu Da Cidian'' includes over 23,000 head [[Chinese character]] entries, defines some 370,000 words, and gives 1,500,000 citations. The head entries, which are [[collation|collated]] by a novel 200 [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]] system, are given in [[traditional Chinese character]]s while [[simplified Chinese character]]s are noted. Definitions and explanations are in simplified, excepting classical quotations. 

Volume 13 has both [[pinyin]] and [[stroke order|stroke]] count indexes, plus appendices. A separate index volume (1997) lists 728,000 entries for characters by their position within words and phrases, something like a reverse dictionary. For instance, the ''Hanyu da cidian'' enters ''[[Daode jing]]'' 道德經 under the head character ''dao''; this reverse-index lists it under both ''de'' and ''jing''. "Despite the fact that it weighs over 20 kilos and contains a total of 50 million characters spread over 20,000 large double-column pages," says Wilkinson (2000:71), "the ''Hanyu da cidian'' is an easy dictionary to use to the full because it is unusually well indexed." It became even easier to use when [[Victor H. Mair]] edited a single-sort alphabetically arranged pinyin index (2003).

''Hanyu Da Cidian'' was consulted in the writing of ''[[The First Series of Standardized Forms of Words with Non-standardized Variant Forms]]''.&lt;ref name="yixingci"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ling.whu.edu.cn/law/002/2016-04-20/1300.html |title=第一批异形词整理表（试行）|language=Simplified Chinese|author=国家语言文字工作委员会|quote=|date=20 April 2016|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

===Optical disc editions===
The abridged CD-ROM version (2.0) contains 18,013 head characters, 336,385 words and phrases (without pinyin), and 861,956 citations. It includes male and female sound files for single-syllable pronunciation, and enables more than 20 search methods. It requires [[Microsoft Windows]], with a Chinese [[locale (computer software)|locale]] setting due to its use of [[GB 18030]].

The 3.0 CD-ROM version was released in 2007. This version includes [[SecuROM]] DRM copy protection software in its installation, possibly in response to the earlier version's [[ISO image]] being [[Copyright infringement of software|illegally distributed]] on [[VeryCD]].  Due to design errors, the 2007 version of 3.0 is incompatible with Windows 7 OS; rather than release a free software patch to fix the problem, the publisher began selling an otherwise unchanged, full-price Windows 7-compatible version of 3.0 in 2010.

[[File:Eloise_Hawser,_Somerset_House.jpg|thumb|A 2018 temporary exhibition in what were previously known as the Hermitage Rooms]]
The '''Hermitage Rooms''' was the name by which a series of rooms at [[Somerset House]], [[London]], were known from 2000 to 2007. During this period they were used as a venue for temporary exhibitions from the collection of the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/britain/england/london/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654610311 Hermitage Rooms at Somerset House — Reviews and Ratings of Sights in London]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[New York Times]] Travel''.&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership with the Hermitage has since ended and the rooms are no longer known by this name, although they continue to house temporary exhibitions.

==History and construction==
The project was established in the 1990s under the direction of [[Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]], and is funded by individual and corporate donors and admission fees. Several rooms in the south wing of Somerset House were redecorated in a style reminiscent of the interiors of the [[Winter Palace]] and opened to the public in November 2000. 

In 2003, a new Somerset House Learning Centre opened, which is used in conjunction with the Hermitage Rooms and the other visitor attractions in the building. It was funded from the proceeds of the July 2002 Somerset House gala, ''An Evening with [[Elton John]]''. Also in 2003 the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], housed nearby in the [[Strand, London|Strand]] block of Somerset House, assumed responsibility for the Hermitage Rooms.&lt;ref&gt;http://swapherm.adaptivetechnologies.com/about_us/press_release_may2003.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first exhibition at the Hermitage Rooms was called ''Treasures of Catherine the Great''. Subsequent exhibitions have featured not only Western painting, but also themes such as photography, ceramics, and [[Islamic art]]. In some cases the Hermitage's works have been supplemented by items from other collections, including (as in the case of ''[[Peter Paul Rubens]]: A Touch of Brilliance'') from the Courtauld Institute Gallery.

In 2005 the future of the Hermitage Rooms became uncertain after the Hermitage announced its plans to withdraw its loans of artworks overseas. This was the result of an international loan crisis prompted by the seizure in November of paintings belonging to the [[Pushkin Museum]] in [[Moscow]] as hostages in a trade dispute between a [[Geneva]]-based company and the Russian state (owners of both the Hermitage and the Pushkin).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article01.asp?id=104 The Art Newspaper article].&lt;/ref&gt;

The rooms were closed until June 2007 when a new exhibition was put into place. This ran until November 2007 and was titled "France in Russia: Empress Josephine's Malmaison Collection".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitagerooms.com/exhibitions/ Hermitage Rooms exhibitions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127092053/http://www.hermitagerooms.com/exhibitions/ |date=27 November 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christos Theofilou''' ({{lang-el|Χρήστος Θεοφίλου}}; January 2, 1897 – August 19, 1975), better known as "'''The Golden Greek'''" '''Jim Londos''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Τζίμ Λόντος), was a [[Greek American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]].

Londos  was one of the most popular stars on the professional wrestling circuit in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name=HornbakerLondos&gt;{{cite book | title=Legends of Pro Wrestling - 150 years of headlocks, body slams, and piledrivers | first=Tim | last=Hornbaker | publisher=Sports Publishing | isbn=978-1-61321-808-2 | location=New York, New York | chapter= Londos, Jim | pages=23–24 | year= 2016 | edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
{{quote_box|width=20%|align=left|quote=What a man!

What an artist!|source= —''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;ref name="yo2"/&gt;}}
  
Jim Londos was born Christos Theofilou in 1897 in Koutsopodi, Argos, Greece as the youngest of thirteen children of Theophilos and Maria. Before arriving in the United States, in his native Greece young Londos was a shepherd. His father,  Theophilos was an amateur wrestler of considerable reputation, and is credited with having instructed his young son in some of the fundamentals.&lt;ref name="yo"&gt;Hackett, T: ''[[Slaphappy: Pride, Prejudice, and Professional Wrestling]]'', page 36. [[HarperCollins]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; At age thirteen he ran away from home and eventually emigrated to the [[United States]]. Working whenever he could, Theofilou took several odd jobs including cabin boy, construction jobs, and [[Model (art)|posing nude]] for [[figure drawing]] classes.&lt;ref name="yo2"&gt;Hackett, page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Theofilou landed a job as a catcher in a carnival acrobatic act. It was during this period that he was exposed to professional wrestling and began training.

Londos' first matches, from 1912,&lt;ref&gt;http://wrestlingclassics.com/.ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=10;t=003280#000000&lt;/ref&gt; were as "The Wrestling Plasterer" Christopher Theophelus, a [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that saw him coming to the ring in overalls.&lt;ref name="yo2"/&gt; After a number of years, he dropped this in favour of wrestling under the name Jim Londos and being a no-nonsense professional wrestler.

To compensate for his lack of wrestling ability, Londos traded on his good looks and well-muscled physique.&lt;ref name="yo2"/&gt; He capitalized on this by having himself matched up against the ugliest opponents he could find.&lt;ref name="spotlight"/&gt; This worked very well and Londos became one of the most popular wrestlers in the 1930s &amp; early 1940s while continuing to attract large crowds until 1959.

Just before his retirement he married [[Americans|American]] woman Avra C. Rochwite (1912-1998), who was born in Clayton, Montana. At the time of their marriage, Rochwite was described in press reports as a "St. Louis Aviatrix." The couple had three daughters: Diana, Demetra, and Christina. The Londos family moved to Escondido, California, where they settled on a 10-acre site nestled in an avocado grove. There, Londos quietly managed his orchard and other investments; he devoted the rest of his public life to charity.

Londos was considered a national hero in [[Greece]]. When he traveled there, one of his matches drew a crowd estimated as nearly 100,000 fans.&lt;ref name="spotlight"/&gt;

== Retirement ==
Londos retired in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&amp;wrestler=2878&amp;bild=1&amp;details=4|title=Profile: Jim Londos|publisher=WrestlingData.com|accessdate=January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the rest of his life working for charitable organizations. His favorite charity was Greek war orphans of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="spotlight"/&gt; He was honored by both United States President [[Richard Nixon]] and King [[Paul of Greece]] for his philanthropic efforts.&lt;ref name="spotlight"/&gt;

Londos died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] August 19, 1975 and is buried at Oak Hill Memorial Park in [[Escondido, California]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1775">'''Kaikuzi''' or '''Kayikuuzi''' is a character in the Gandan [[creation myth]], [[The_legend_of_Kintu|The Legend of Kintu]]. He is the son of [[Ggulu]]. His name is translated as "the digger." He is responsible for attempting to rid the Earth of [[Walumbe]], meaning "death" or "disease."

==The Legend==

After [[The_legend_of_Kintu|Kintu]] succeeds in [[Ggulu]]'s tests and returns to Earth with Nambi and [[Walumbe]], he soon finds that in keeping with the Ganda tradition, Walumbe, as a brother of the bride, desires one of Kintu's children as his own. Kintu refuses [[Walumbe]] and continues to do so throughout the years. Frustrated, [[Walumbe]], then begins to kill a single child every day. After conversing with [[Ggulu]], Kaikuzi is sent to aid Kintu in returning [[Walumbe]] to heaven. Kaikuzi grapples with [[Walumbe]], who then retreats by burrowing into the Earth. Kaikuzi pursues [[Walumbe]], yet soon tires of the task. Kaikuzi then orders that there be two days of silence so as to lure [[Walumbe]] out. Kaikuzi then returns to his pursuit of [[Walumbe]] who finally emerges at a place called Tanda (located on the southside of the road to Mityana). At this place, children cry out at the sight of him and he again retreats into the earth. Kaikuzi then appears at Tanda and becomes frustrated upon hearing that the children broke the silence. Upon Kintu's dismissal, Kaikuzi returns to heaven and explains the situation to [[Ggulu]]. Upon hearing of this, Ggulu allows [[Walumbe]], and thus death, to remain on Earth.

The '''Kamusi Project''' is a cooperative online dictionary which aims to produce dictionaries and other language resources for every language, and to make those resources available free to everyone. Users can register and add content. "Kamusi" is the [[swahili language|Swahili]] word for dictionary. It belongs to Kamusi Project International based in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;http://kamusi.ch/&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was started in 1994 at the Council on African Studies at [[Yale University]] (United States) as an online dictionary of the Swahili language under the name of the "Internet Living Swahili Dictionary" by its founder and present director Martin Benjamin.&lt;ref&gt;http://kamusi.org/content/what-history-kamusi-project&lt;/ref&gt; Since  restructuring in 2014 the Swahili vocabulary is no more accessible.

In 2007 the project spun off from Yale. Since 2009 it has been run jointly by Kamusi Project International, a non profit association registered in Geneva, [[Switzerland]], and Kamusi Project USA, a [[501(c)(3) organization]]. From 2013 through 2017, it also had an academic base at the Distributed Information Systems Laboratory at [[École_Polytechnique_Fédérale_de_Lausanne|EPFL]] in [[Lausanne]].

Since 2010 programming and the Swahili-English database have been expanded to incorporate other languages. Kamusi project is open to build interconnected dictionaries for all existing languages. The project was knocked offline for a year beginning in mid-2015 when its server was unable to handle the data load for expanding to multiple languages. After reprogramming within a [[graph database]] paradigm, service was restored and opened to many new languages in 2016, though conversion of the original Swahili data to the new system continues to languish due to lack of funds.

Kamusi was recognized by the [[Obama]] administration as a launch partner in the White House Big Data Initiative in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2013/11/14/the-white-house-honors-sap-stanford-and-nct/#5d143882305f&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the project began an experimental technical development wing called Kamusi Labs that grows the project through volunteer internship projects with students from universities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://kamusi.org/info/kamusilabs&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the project distributed more than 60,000 entries between Swahili and English via a mobile app called "English Swahili Dictionary Fr",  and had concept-linked data containing 1,769,137 terms across 43 languages. In addition to the kamusi.org website, this data, comprising 1806 bilingual dictionaries, is available for free to the public via the Kamusi Here! app on Android and iPhone, KamusiBot on Facebook, and EmojiWorldBot on Telegram.

'''LINPACK''' is a software [[Library (computer science)|library]] for performing numerical [[linear algebra]] on [[digital computers]].  It was written in [[Fortran]] by [[Jack Dongarra]], Jim Bunch, [[Cleve Moler]], and Gilbert Stewart, and was intended for use on [[supercomputer]]s in the 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been largely superseded by [[LAPACK]], which runs more efficiently on modern architectures.

LINPACK makes use of the [[Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms|BLAS]] (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) libraries for performing basic vector and matrix operations.

The [[LINPACK benchmarks]] appeared initially as part of the LINPACK user's manual. The parallel LINPACK benchmark implementation called HPL (High Performance Linpack) is used to benchmark and rank supercomputers for the [[TOP500]] list.

'''''Luther Burbank: His Methods and Discoveries, Their Practical Application''''' is one of the first sets of books published using color photography and is the most-extensive publication of the work of [[Luther Burbank]] (1849–1926).

[[File:Luther Burbank - His Methods and Discoveries - 4 bindings.JPG|thumb|Four bindings of the 12-volume set.]]

==Luther Burbank history==
''Luther Burbank: His Methods and Discoveries'' is a twelve-volume set published by the Luther Burbank Press in 1914 and 1915. The set was sold by subscription.

Each volume has 105 color photographs tipped in, for a total of 1260 photographs. The photos provide an extensive record of Burbank’s work in Santa Rosa and Sebastopol from 1875 to 1914.

The books apparently had at least six writers including Oscan Binner, [[Edward J. Wickson]] and Henry Smith Williams, M.D., LL.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Garden of Invention:  Luther Burbank and the Business of Breeding Plants | first1=Jane S. | last1=Smith | publisher=The Penguin Press |  year=2009 | pages=214–216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Harrison Shull|George Shull]] reported that “considerable sections are most word for word the same as my manuscript.”  Further, Shull found the text wanting:  "It appears to me a criminal waste of good paper...  The colored plates will prove both interesting and valuable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Gardner Touched with Genius – The Life of Luther Burbank |  first=Peter | last=Dreyer |  publisher=University of California Press | year = 1985 |  pages=194–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Sold by subscription, three quality levels of binding were offered:  simple cloth, embossed cloth and leather.

The simple-cloth-bound edition was offered in multiple colors:  red, blue, green and gold. Each volume has a black &amp; white photo of Burbank inserted in the front of each cover. The books sold for $180 per set, “when $180 represented the earnings of two months’ work or longer.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Luther Burbank – The Wizard and the Man | first1=Ken | first2=Pat | last1=Kraft | last2=Kraft | publisher=Meredith Press |  year=1967 | page=187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same format as the simple-cloth-bound edition, a suede leather version was offered.  The leather was light in weight and not nearly as sturdy as the full leather editions, below.

The embossed-cloth edition has a cherry design.

The leather-bound edition has a two-tree design with tall trees in panels separated by a blank panel on the front covers. The first volume is endorsed to its buyer and has an original signature of Luther Burbank.

An unusual leather-bound edition with a path scene with stone posts, a gate and trees on along the paths the covers was used for presentation purposes.  These sets do not have the Luther Burbank signature.

Another unusual leather-bound edition has a grape vine with grapes on a T-trellis on the covers.  These have very heavy (wood?) boards.

Special paper was prepared for the volumes which was watermarked “The Luther Burbank Press.”

==Color photography==
[[File:Color Photography Explained 8 - Luther Burbank - His Methods and Discoveries - Their Practical Application Vol. XIII - 1915.JPG|thumb|Number 8 of 9 photographs explaining how color photography works.]]
The volumes are one of the first uses of color photography and color printing.  Since a nationwide search failed to find suitable color printing technology, The Luther Burbank Press set up a photo-chemical laboratory using the process of [[Autochrome Lumière|Lumiere of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Luther Burbank:  His Methods and Discoveries, Their Practical Application | publisher=Luther Burbank Press | year=1915 | last=Burbank | first=Luther | volume=XII | page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last volume has a section which describes how color photography and color printing is accomplished.

==''How Plants are Trained to Work for Man''==
''How Plants are Trained to Work for Man'' by Luther Burbank, Sc.D published in 1921 is clearly a rework of the 1914–1915 work.

The 1921 publication is in eight volumes in a single binding.  Each volume contains 49 photographs printed on separate pages, not the tipped-in photos of the original.

Despite Burbank's claim that, "these eight volumes are not a compilation from the works or words of others,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=How Plants are Trained to Work for Man | first=Luther | last=Burbank | publisher=P. F. Collier &amp; Son Company | year=1921 | volume=I | page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the books cite the copyrights from 1914 and 1915 from the Luther Burbank Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=How Plants are Trained to Work for Man | first=Luther | last=Burbank | publisher=P. F. Collier &amp; Son Company | year=1921 | volume=I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All but two of the photographs in the 1921 volumes came from the 1914–1915 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;One new photograph is of Luther Burbank and the other is of Mrs. Luther Burbank who was not married to Luther Burbank at the time of the 1914–1915 volumes.&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, photographs in the first volumes of the early set are found in the first volumes of the later set, with this trend continuing to the last volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=An Evaluation of Luther Burbank's 1914–1915 and 1921 Books | url=http://www.winepi.com/LutherBurbank.htm | accessdate=January 10, 2013 | last=Von der Porten | first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Sc.D" is from the honorary doctor of science degree awarded Burbank by Tufts University in 1905.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2272">'''MOOMA''' is a [[web site]] dedicated to [[Israeli music]]. It contains information about Israeli artists from all genres, as well as general articles and news about Israeli music. The site editor is Ayelet Yagil.

The site was created by the [[Keshet (TV)|Keshet TV]] group, as part of the group portfolio prepared toward a tender for an Israeli music TV channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/news/home.aspx?fid=2&amp;did=549825&amp;nagish=1 Keshet reduces its activities and fires 30% of employees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061525/http://www.globes.co.il/news/home.aspx?fid=2&amp;did=549825&amp;nagish=1 |date=2016-03-04 }}, Globs, 7 January 2003 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

The major part of the site is an [[encyclopedia]] of Israeli music and artists, which historically documents significant parts of the [[Israeli culture]]. It also has articles in Hebrew about a selection of foreign artists. This information bank was created and is maintained by the Israeli radio presenter and music critic [[Yoav Kutner]]; it includes biographies and discographies of many [[Israelis|Israeli]] artists, and links to similar and related artists.

Initially the site included a music magazine, [[Internet forum|forums]] and several [[Internet radio|web radio channels]]. These were dropped in 2001 after Keshet TV decided to cut the websites' budget, during the 2001 [[Dot-com bubble]] burst.

MOOMA's founders then went on to win the music TV channel tender, and launched [[Music 24]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3083503.stm Israeli station plans homegrown sounds, BBC news, 21 July, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; There were trials to reopen the site with government funding, but they failed. Eventually the site reopened with the help of the Lemelbaum family, who requested that the site will be dedicated to the memory of their daughter Ella Loren (1972–2000), a singer and model who died from [[skin cancer]].

In 2008, the website was merged into the newly created [[Keshet (TV)#mako|mako]].

'''Mission San Carlos Borromeo del río Carmelo''' or '''Misión de San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo''', first built in 1797, is one of the most authentically restored [[Roman Catholic]] [[Spanish missions in California|mission church]]es in California. Located in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]], it is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and is a [[U.S. National Historic Landmark|National Historic Landmark]]. The mission was the headquarters of all [[Alta California]] missions from 1797 until 1833. It was headed by Saint [[Junípero Serra]] from 1770 until his death in 1784. It was also the seat of the second ''presidente'', Father [[Fermin Francisco de Lasuen]], who was in charge of completing nine more mission churches.

The mission buildings and lands were [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularized]] by the Mexican government in 1833. They fell into disrepair by the mid-19th century.

Mission Carmel ({{aka}} as the '''Carmel Mission'''), was the second mission built by Franciscan missionaries in Upper California. It was first established as Mission San Carlos Borromeo in [[Monterey, California]] near the native village of ''Tamo'' on June 3, 1770. It was named for [[Charles Borromeo|Carlo Borromeo]], [[Archbishop]] of [[Milan]], [[Italy]], and was the site of the first Christian [[confirmation]] in [[Alta California]].&lt;ref name="ruscin196"/&gt;  When the mission moved, the original building continued to operate as the [[Presidio of Monterey|Royal Presidio]] chapel and later became the current [[Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo]].

=== Relocation to Carmel ===

[[Pedro Fages]], who served as military governor of Alta California from 1770 to 1774, kept his headquarters in the [[polity]]'s capitol, at the [[Presidio of Monterey, California|Presidio of Monterey]]. Fages worked his men very harshly and was seen as a tyrant. Serra intervened on behalf of Rages' soldiers, and the two men did not get along.&lt;ref name=walton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walton|first1=John|title=Storied Land: Community and Memory in Monterey|date=2003|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=9780520935679|page=15ff|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pr7YKHJFXtcC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17|accessdate=5 September 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paddison, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Fages regarded the Spanish installations in California as military institutions first, and religious outposts second. The soldiers raped the Indian woman and kept them as concubines.&lt;ref name=walton/&gt; Serra wanted to put some distance between the missions [[wikt:neophyte|neophytes]] and Fages' soldiers.

Serra found that the land near the mouth of the [[Carmel River]] (named ''Río del Carmelo'' by Vizcaíno in 1603&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Donald Thomas. 1991. ''Monterey County Place Names: a Geographical Dictionary''. Carmel Valley, Calif: Kestrel Press.&lt;/ref&gt;) was better suited for farming.&lt;ref name=Breschini&gt;{{cite web|last=Breschini, Ph.D.|first=Gary S.|title=Mission San Carlos Borromeo (Carmel)|url=http://www.mchsmuseum.com/carmelmission.html|publisher=Monterey County Historical Museum|accessdate=22 June 2013|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1771, Spain's [[viceroy]] approved Serra's petition to relocate the mission. The mission was established in the new location on August 1, 1771; the first mass was celebrated on August 24, and Serra officially took up residence in the newly constructed buildings on December 24.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the relocated mission was extended to ''Mission San Carlos Borromeo del Río Carmelo''. It was within a short distance of the Rumsen [[Ohlone]] villages of Tucutnut and Achasta. The latter village may have been founded after Mission San Carlos was relocated to Carmel. The mission was about {{convert|10|mi}} from the nearest Esselen territory, Excelen.&lt;ref name=mhcs/&gt;

=== Indian baptisms ===

After the Carmel mission was moved to Carmel Valley, the Franciscans began to baptize some natives.&lt;ref name=carmelresource/&gt; By the end of 1771, the population of mission was 15 with an additional 22 baptized Indians, out of a total population of northern California of 60.&lt;ref name=Breschini /&gt;

Farming was not very productive and for several years the mission was dependent upon the arrival of supply ships.&lt;ref name=Breschini /&gt; Historian Jame Culleton wrote in 1950, "The summer of '73 came without bringing the supply ship. Neither Carmel nor Monterey was anything like self-supporting."&lt;ref name=Breschini/&gt;

To improve baptismal rates, they sought to convert key members of the [[Esselen people|Esselen]] and [[Rumsen people|Rumsen]] tribes, including chiefs. On May 9, 1775, Junípero Serra baptized what appears to be the first Esselen, ''Pach-hepas'', who was the 40-year-old chief of the Excelen. His baptism took place at Xasáuan, 10 [[league (unit)|league]]s (about  {{convert|26|mi}}) southeast of the mission, in an area now named Cachagua, a close approximation of the Esselen name.&lt;ref name=mhcs&gt;Breschini, Gary S.; Trudy Haversat. "A Brief Overview of the Esselen Indians of Monterey County". Monterey County Historical Society. Retrieved November 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This persuaded some Indians to follow them to the mission.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Forced labor ===

The Esselen and [[Ohlone]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] who lived near the mission were baptized and then forcibly relocated and conscripted as forced laborers. Neophytes were taught to be farmers, shepherds, cowboys, blacksmiths, carpenters, bricklayers, furniture makers, tanners, weavers and candle makers. Disease, starvation, overwork, and torture decimated these tribes.&lt;ref name=started/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pritzker |first1=Barry M. |title= Encyclopedia: History, Culture, and Peoples |date=2000 |publisher= Oxford Univ.

=== Crops and livestock ===

In the beginning, the mission relied on bear meat from [[Mission San Antonio de Padua]] and supplies brought by ship from [[Mission San Diego de Alcalá]].&lt;ref name=Breschini/&gt;

In 1779, the natives Americans at Carmel Mission harvested 1660 bushels of wheat, 700 bushels of barley, 165 bushels of beans, and 85 bushels of maize. Four years later, the native laborers produced enough crops to support 700 people. The mission had more than 500 cattle and sheep.&lt;ref name=started/&gt;

Carmel mission continued to grow during most of the 18th century. The largest population was neophytes was 876 in 1795. By 1800, agriculture production at Carmel Mission was near its peak. The Mission reported to Mexico that it had 2180 horses and cattle, and 4160 smaller livestock including sheep. The total grain harvested was about 3700 bushels per year with a high of 7400 in 1797.&lt;ref name=started/&gt;

In December 1832, the mission reported to Mexico that it had 2,100 cattle, 3,300 sheep, 410 horses, and 8 mules.&lt;ref name=fdnhistory/&gt;

=== Serra's headquarters ===

"Mission Carmel", as it came to be known, was Serra's favorite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gondosch|first1=Linda|title=Carmel Mission in California|url=https://americanhistorytales.com/2016/10/21/carmel-mission-in-california/|website=American History Tales (blog)|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, because it was close to Monterey, the capital of Alta California, he chose it as his headquarters. When he died on August 28, 1784, he was interred beneath the chapel floor. After Serra's death, Father [[Fermin Francisco de Lasuen|Fermin Lasuén]] replaced the adobe structure with one made of stone quarried from the nearby [[Santa Lucia Mountains]].&lt;ref name=missionhistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission History – Carmel Mission|url=https://carmelmission.org/visit/4th-grade-corner/mission-history/|website=carmelmission.org|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secularized and abandoned ===

Eight months later, in August 1833, the newly independent Mexican government secularized the mission and all its lands. It stipulated that half the mission lands should be awarded to the native people, but this purpose was never accomplished. Most mission property was bought by government officials or their wealthy friends.&lt;ref name="started"&gt;{{cite web|title=How it all Started|url=http://mission-carmel-isheeta.weebly.com/history.html|website=Carmel Mission|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The priests could not maintain the missions without the Indians' forced labor and the mission and lands were soon abandoned. The Indians were forced from the mission. Some attempted to return to their native ways, and others found work as ranch hands or servants on farms and ranches.&lt;ref name=missionhistory/&gt;

By 1850, the mission was nearly a ruin. The stone chapel building was deteriorating while most of the adobe buildings were eroding away. The roof collapsed in 1852. The U.S. federal government returned the mission and its lands to the Catholic Church in 1859.&lt;ref name=fdnhistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Carmel Mission Foundation|url=http://www.carmelmissionfoundation.org/history.htm|website=www.carmelmissionfoundation.org|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restoration ===
[[File:Carmel Mission basilica1880.png|thumb|left|Interior view of the façade of the capilla (chapel) in 1880 prior to restoration.]]

When Mexico [[Mexican Cession|ceded]] California to the United States following the [[Mexican–American War]], the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] provided that the land grants would be honored, but required that the owners provide legal proof of their title. As required by the [[California Land Act of 1851|Land Act of 1851]], [[Archbishop]] [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]] filed a claim on February 19, 1853 on behalf of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. He sought return of all former [[Spanish missions in California|mission]] lands in the State. The state agreed to return the original mission buildings, cemeteries, and gardens to the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=William Wilcox|title=Land in California, the Story of Mission Land, Ranches, Squatters, Mining Claims, Railroad Grants, Land Scrip, Homesteads|date=January 10, 2012|publisher=HardPress Publishing|isbn=1-4076-9580-0|pages=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31–32}}

When the Roman Catholic Church gained full control of the buildings on October 19, 1859, the mission was in ruins.&lt;ref name=missionhistory /&gt; In 1884 Father Angel Casanova was able to gather enough private funds to replace the roof on the chapel sufficient to preserve it until the 1930s. In 1931 Monsignor Philip Scher hired master cabinet maker Henry John ("Harry") Downie who had an excellent reputation for restoring Spanish antiques. Scher initially asked Downie to restore some statues at the Carmel Mission but his job quickly expanded and he was put in charge of restoring the entire mission.&lt;ref name=scrapbook&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Downie Scrapbook |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8tm7bv5/ |website=www.oac.cdlib.org|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fdnhistory /&gt; Two years later, the church transferred the mission from the Franciscans to the local diocese and it became a regular [[parish church]]. Downie lived nearby in Carmel and worked almost daily for almost 50 years to restore the mission, ancillary buildings, walls, and grounds. He painstakingly researched the church's architecture and site, often relying on original Spanish sources, and gathered genuine artifacts from across California.&lt;ref name=missionhistory /&gt;

He first restored the padres' quarters, then the roof of the chapel in 1936, and over the next five years the interior of the basilica.&lt;ref name=missionhistory /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Today|url=http://mission-carmel-isheeta.weebly.com/mission-today.html|website=Carmel Mission|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, he oversaw restoration of the former soldiers' quarters on the east side of the quadrangle. In 1943 he began restoration of a building that had been on the south side of the quadrangle, although nothing was left but the eroded adobe foundation and a few ruined walls. The building was originally a segregated, locked dormitory for girls called the monjero (nunnery). They were separated from their families at age 8. The boys and unmarried men also had their own dormitory, though it was less confining.&lt;ref name=fogel&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fogel|first1=Daniel|title=Junípero Serra, the Vatican and Enslavement Theology|date=1988|publisher=Ism Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-910383-25-7}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|117–119}}

The building was reconstructed and made into classrooms for Junipero Serra Elementary School. In 1946, the ruin on the east side of the quadrangle that had been the original padre's kitchen and a blacksmith shop was rebuilt. It is used today as a chapel. Downie also consulted on the restoration of the missions that are considered the most authentic, including [[Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa|San Luis Obispo]], [[Mission San Juan Bautista|San Juan Bautista]], and [[Mission San Buenaventura|San Buenaventura]]. He also helped the Native Daughters of the Golden West to reconstruct [[Mission Nuestra Señora de la Soledad|Mission Soledad]].&lt;ref name=scrapbook /&gt; He was knighted by [[Pope Pius XII|Pope Pius]] and by [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos]] of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carmel Projects|url=http://www.studiob6.com/the-real-thing-home.html|website=www.studiob6.com|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=missionhistory /&gt;

In 1960, the mission was designated as a minor [[basilica]] by [[Pope John XXIII]].   In 1987, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the mission as part of his U.S. tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131062637/http://carmelmission.org/museum/students/history.php|title=San Carlos Borroméo de Carmelo Mission: Mission History|date=31 January 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carmel Mission, Junipero Serra's favorite place|url=http://www.seecalifornia.com/visit/carmel-mission-junipero-serras-favorite-place.html|website=See California|publisher=See California|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original bell nicknamed Ave Maria was made in Mexico City in 1807. It was placed at the Mission in 1820. When the mission was secularized in 1834, the bell was removed and held onto by local Native Americans for safekeeping. It was finally lost and relocated once again during restoration. It was re-installed in the mission bell tower in 1925.&lt;ref name=bells /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carmel Mission – A Peek into California's Past {{!}} Uncharted101.com|url=https://www.uncharted101.com/carmel-mission-a-peek-into-californias-past/|website=www.uncharted101.com|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==

[[File:Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo  (Carmel, CA) - basilica interior, nave.jpg|thumb|left|The basilica nave.]]
As a result of Downie's dedicated efforts to restore the buildings, the Carmel mission church is one of the most authentically restored of all the mission churches in California. Mission Carmel has been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[National Park Service]]. It is an active parish church of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionscalifornia.com/keyfacts/san-carlos-borremeo-de-carmelo.html|title=San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo|work=missionscalifornia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt;

In addition to its activity as a place of worship, Mission Carmel also hosts concerts, art exhibits, lectures and numerous other community events. In 1986, then-[[pastor]] Monsignor Eamon MacMahon acquired a [[Casavant Frères]] organ with [[horizontal trumpet]]s. Its hand-painted casework is decorated with elaborate carvings and statuary reflecting the Spanish decorative style seen on the main altar.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The mission also serves as a museum, preserving its own history and the history of the area. There are four specific museum galleries: the Harry Downie Museum, describing restoration efforts; the Munras Family Heritage Museum, describing the history of one of the most important area families; the Jo Mora Chapel Gallery, hosting rotating art exhibits as well as the monumental bronze and travertine cenotaph (1924) sculpted by [[Jo Mora]];&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Jennie V.

The mission grounds are also the location of the Junipero Serra School, a private Catholic school for kindergartners through 8th grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juniperoserra.org/|title=Junipero Serra School|work=juniperoserra.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern restoration ===
 
In 2012, the Carmel Mission Foundation began a project to restore the roof of the basilica installed during a restoration in 1937. The project was the third major reconstruction of the basilica since it was built in 1797. The contractor installed additional wood and steel beams to reinforce and tie the roof structure together. To strengthen the walls, they drilled over 300 center-cored vertical and horizontal holes in the {{convert|5|ft}} thick walls, into which they inserted steel rods that were grouted in place. The project also updated the electrical system and added a fire suppression system. The interior lighting was replaced and custom-made chandeliers were added. The project upgraded the radiant heating system and included construction of an [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]]-compliant restroom. The project was funded by the Carmel Mission Foundation, which raised about $6.2 million.&lt;ref name=foundation&gt;{{cite web|title=Carmel Mission Foundation|url=http://www.carmelmissionfoundation.org/restoration.htm|website=www.carmelmissionfoundation.org|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the foundation funded reconstruction of the Quadrangle Courtyard at a cost of $2.0 million. The uneven, cracked concrete surface was a hazard. It was removed and new water and fire lines, drains, sewer, electrical, and communications lines were installed before a new concrete, durable concrete surface was poured.&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt;

The foundation is planning a larger $20 million project in time for the 250th anniversary of the basilica in 2020. It includes seismic retrofits, infrastructure improvements, and restoration of the several historic structures, including the Downie Museum and Orientation Center, Mora Chapel Museum, Convento Museum (including the museum store), and Blessed Sacrament Chapel.&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt;

===Vandalism===
On September 27, 2015, in response to Serra's canonization, the San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo Mission was vandalized. The statue of Serra was toppled and splattered with paint, and the cemetery, the mission doors, a fountain, and a crucifix were as well. The message "Saint of Genocide" was put on Serra's tomb, and similar messages were painted elsewhere in the mission courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Stack, "Vandals Desecrate Carmel Mission Where Junípero Serra Is Buried", ''[[New York Times]]'', September 28, 2015, http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/us/carmel-california-junipero-serra-pope-francis-vandalism.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2015/statue-of-st-junipero-serra-defaced-at-californias-carmel-mission.cfm|title=statue of st junipero serra defaced at californias carmel mission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Museum Campus''' is a {{convert|57|acre|adj=on}} park in [[Chicago]] that sits alongside [[Lake Michigan]] in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] and encompasses five of the city's most notable attractions: the [[Adler Planetarium]], [[United States|America's]] first planetarium; the [[Shedd Aquarium]]; the [[Field Museum of Natural History]]; [[Soldier Field]], home of the [[NFL]] [[Chicago Bears]] football team; and the Lakeside Center of [[McCormick Place]]. Museum Campus sits adjacent to [[Northerly Island]] along the waterfront.

==History==
[[File:Museum Campus, Chicago.jpg|thumb|250px|Pedestrian tunnel in the Museum Campus running underneath Lake Shore Drive]]The Museum Campus was created to transform the vicinity of three of the city's most notable museums – the [[Adler Planetarium]], the [[Shedd Aquarium]], and the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] – along with Soldier Field stadium, into a scenic [[pedestrian-friendly]] area. The area is landscaped with greenery and flora as well as jogging paths and walkways. A picturesque promenade along Solidarity Drive, an [[isthmus]], links [[Northerly Island]] to the mainland. The drive itself is lined with a number of grand [[Bronze sculpture|bronze monuments]] commemorating [[Thaddeus Kościuszko|Kościuszko]], [[Karel Havlíček Borovský|Havliček]], and [[Nicholas Copernicus]], the last of which is a replica of a famous 19th-century work in [[Warsaw]] by Danish sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Museum Campus opened on June 4, 1998, when the northbound lanes of [[Lake Shore Drive]] were moved west of [[Soldier Field]] following the route of the expressway's southbound lanes. By removing the roadway which bisected the area, Museum Campus was created into a green space for the enjoyment of both residents and tourists.  In 2014, a consortium of museums in or near the [[University of Chicago]], formed Museum Campus South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitmuseumcampussouth.com/|title=Museum Campus South|author=|date=|website=Museum Campus South|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2014/07/24/south-side-museums-form-museum-campus-south/|title=South Side Museums Form "Museum Campus South"|author=|date=24 July 2014|website=cbslocal.com|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2014, filmmaker [[George Lucas]] selected Museum Campus as the location of the [[Lucas Museum of Narrative Art]], which would have cost an estimated $700 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sneed|first=Michael|title=Sneed Exclusive: Chicago to Get George Lucas Museum|url=http://politics.suntimes.com/article/chicago/sneed-exclusive-chicago-get-george-lucas-museum/tue-06242014-346pm-1|date=June 24, 2014|publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''|accessdate=June 24, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107035736/http://politics.suntimes.com/article/chicago/sneed-exclusive-chicago-get-george-lucas-museum/tue-06242014-346pm-1|archivedate=November 7, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded Museum Campus south along the city's waterfront. However, these plans were cancelled in June 2016 due to opposition from the Friends of the Parks advocacy group.

In August 2016, in a partnership with the City of Chicago, the Chicago Parks District and [http://ewfiber.com/ Everywhere Wireless], Museum Campus joined many [http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2015/august/mayor-emanuel--chicago-park-district-announce-expansion-of-free-.html Chicago Beaches] and [[Buckingham Fountain]] in providing free Wi-Fi to visitors.

In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, the Museum Campus was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waldinger|first=Mike|title=The proud history of architecture in Illinois|url=https://springfieldbusinessjournal.com/2018/01/the-proud-history-of-architecture-in-illinois/|accessdate=30 January 2018|newspaper=Springfield Business Journal|date=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[American Institute of Architects]] Illinois component (AIA Illinois).

==''Rasul v. Bush''==
Initially, the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] [[United States President|Presidency]]
asserted that none of the captives apprehended during the "[[War on Terrorism|global war on terror]]" were protected by the [[Geneva Conventions]].  The Bush Presidency asserted that the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] was not United States territory, and that it was not subject to United States law.  Consequently, they challenged that the captives were entitled to submit writs of [[habeas corpus]].

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled, in ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'', that the Guantanamo base was covered by US law.

The [http://cadindia.clpr.org.in/historical_constitutions/declaration_of_purna_swaraj__indian_national_congress__1930__26th%20January%201930 '''Purna Swaraj''' declaration], or '''Declaration of the Independence of India''', was promulgated by the [[Indian National Congress - Freedom Era|Indian National Congress]] on 19 December 1929, resolving the Congress and Indian nationalists to fight for '''Purna [[Swaraj]]''', or ''complete self-rule'' independent of the [[British Empire]] (literally in [[Sanskrit]], ''purna'' ({{lang-hi|[[wikt:पूर्ण|पूर्ण]]}}), "complete", ''swa'' ({{lang-hi|[[wikt:स्व|स्व]]}}), "self," ''raj'' ({{lang-hi|[[wikt:राज|राज]]}}), "rule," thus "complete self-rule").

The [[flag of India]] was hoisted by Jawaharlal Nehru on 31 December 1929 on the banks of [[Ravi river]], in [[Lahore]], modern-day [[Pakistan]]. The Congress asked the people of India to observe 26th of January as '''Independence Day'''. The flag of India was hoisted publicly across India by Congress volunteers, nationalists and the public.

==Background==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}} 
Before 1930, Indian political parties had openly embraced the goal of political independence from the United Kingdom. The [[All India Home Rule League]] had been advocating ''[[Home Rule]]'' for India: [[dominion]] status within the British Empire, as granted to Australia, Canada, the [[Irish Free State]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], New Zealand, and South Africa. The [[All India Muslim League]] favoured dominion status as well, and opposed calls for outright Indian independence. The [[Indian Liberal Party]], by far the most pro-British party, explicitly opposed India's independence and even dominion status if it weakened India's links with the British Empire. The [[Indian National Congress]], the largest Indian political party of the time, was at the head of the national debate. Congress leader and famous poet [[Hasrat Mohani]] was the first activist to demand complete independence (Poorna Swaraj) from the British in 1921 from an All-India Congress Forum. Veteran Congress leaders such as [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], [[Sri Aurobindo|Aurobindo]] and [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] had also advocated explicit Indian independence from the Empire.

Following the 1919 [[Amritsar Massacre]], there was considerable public outrage against British rule. Europeans, (civilians and officials) were targets and victims of violence across India. In 1920, Gandhi and the Congress committed themselves to ''[[Swaraj]]'', described as political and spiritual independence. At the time, Gandhi described this as the basic demand of all Indians; he specifically said that the question of whether India would remain within the Empire or leave it completely would be answered by the behaviour and response of the British. Between 1920 and 1922, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] led the [[Non-Cooperation movement]]: nationwide [[civil disobedience]] to oppose the [[Rowlatt Acts]] and the exclusion of Indians from the government, and the denial of political and civil freedoms.

==Simon commission and the Nehru report==
In 1928, the British government further outraged people across India by appointing a seven-man committee led by Sir John Simon, it was an all - European commission [[Simon Commission]] to deliberate on constitutional and political reforms for India. Indian political parties were neither consulted nor asked to involve themselves in the process. Upon arrival in India, Chairman [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] and other commission members were met with angry public demonstrations, which followed them everywhere. The death of a prominent Indian leader, [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], from severe beatings by British police officials further outraged the Indian public.

The Congress appointed an all-Indian commission to propose constitutional reforms for India. Members of other Indian political parties joined the commission led by Congress President [[Motilal Nehru]]. The [[Nehru Report]] demanded that India be granted self-government under the dominion status within the Empire. While most other Indian political parties supported the Nehru commission's work, it was opposed by the Indian Liberal Party and the All India Muslim League. The British ignored the commission, its report and refused to introduce political reform.

==Dominion or republic?==
But the Nehru Report was also controversial within the Congress. Younger nationalist leaders like [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] and Jawaharlal Nehru  demanded that the Congress resolve to make a complete and explicit break from all ties with the British. Jawaharlal Nehru had been influenced by the idea of Bhagat Singh ("total independence"), which Singh had introduced a resolution demanding in 1927, which was rejected because of Gandhi's opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rajmohan Gandhi]], ''Patel: A Life'', p. 171, ASIN: B0006EYQ0A&lt;/ref&gt; Now Bose and Nehru opposed dominion status, which would retain the [[Monarch of the United Kingdom]] as the constitutional [[head of state]] of India (although in the separate capacity as [[King of India]]), and preserve political powers for the British Parliament in Indian constitutional affairs. They were supported in their stand by a large number of rank-and-file Congressmen.

In December 1928, Congress session was held in [[Kolkata]] and Mohandas Gandhi proposed a resolution that called for the British to grant dominion status to India within two years. After Some time Gandhi brokered a further compromise by reducing the time given from two years to one. Jawaharlal Nehru voted for the new resolution, while Subhash Bose told his supporters that he would not oppose the resolution, and abstained from voting himself. The [[All India Congress Committee]] voted 118 to 45 in its favour (the 45 votes came from supporters of a complete break from the British). However, when Bose introduced an amendment during the open session of Congress that sought a complete break with the British, Gandhi admonished the move:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You may take the name of independence on your lips but all your muttering will be an empty formula if there is no honour behind it. If you are not prepared to stand by your words, where will independence be?&lt;ref&gt;D. G. Tendulkar, ''Mahatma'', [[Bombay]], 1951, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The amendment was rejected, by 1350 to 973, and the resolution was fully adopted.

On 31 October 1929, the [[Viceroy of India]], Lord [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Irwin]] announced that the government would meet with Indian representatives in London for a [[Round Table Conference]]. To facilitate Indian participation, Irwin met with Mohandas Gandhi, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and out-going Congress President Motilal Nehru to discuss the meeting. Gandhi asked Irwin if the conference would proceed on the basis of dominion status and Irwin said he could not assure that, resulting in the end of the meeting.&lt;ref name="patel185"&gt;R. Gandhi, ''Patel: A Life'', p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

==The declaration==
As a result of the denial of reforms and political rights, and the persistent ignorance of Indian political parties, the Indian National Congress grew increasingly cohesive – unified in the desire to oust the British from India completely.&lt;ref name="patel185" /&gt; A very large number of Congress volunteers and delegates, members of other political parties and an especially large public gathering attended the session convened in Lahore. Despite the bitterly cold weather, [[Pattabhi Sitaramayya]] records that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The heat of passion and excitement, the resentment at the failure of negotiation, the flushing of faces on hearing the war drums – oh, it was all in marked contrast to the weather.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pattabhi Sitaramayya]], ''The History of the Congress'', [[Allahabad]], 1935, p. 600&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jawaharlal Nehru was elected President and veteran leaders like [[Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari]] and [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] returned to the [[Congress Working Committee]]. They approved a declaration of independence, which stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually.... Therefore...India must sever the British connection and attain '''Purna Swaraj''' or complete independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Purna Swaraj: The Demand for Full Independence 26 January 1930|url = http://www.indiaofthepast.org/contribute-memories/read-contributions/major-events-pre-1950/283-purna-swaraj-the-demand-for-full-independence-26-january-1930-|accessdate = 2015-07-06|publisher = India of the Past}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At midnight on New Year's Eve, President Jawaharlal Nehru hoisted the tricolour flag of India upon the banks of the [[Ravi River|Ravi]] in Lahore, which later became part of Pakistan. A pledge of independence was read out, which included a readiness to withhold taxes. The massive gathering of public attending the ceremony were asked if they agreed with it, and the vast majority of people were witnessed to raise their hands in approval. One hundred seventy two Indian members of central and provincial legislatures resigned in support of the resolution and in accordance with Indian public sentiment.

The Declaration of Independence was officially promulgated on 26 January 1930. Gandhi and other Indian leaders would immediately begin the planning of a massive national non-violence would encourage the common people not to attack Britishers even if they attacked them.&lt;ref name="patel185" /&gt; Subsequently, the ''[[Salt Satyagraha]]'' was initiated by Mahatma Gandhi on 12 March 1930 and what followed gave impetus to the [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] movement and sparked off the nationwide [[Non Cooperation Movement|Non Cooperation]] Movement.

The resolution was a short 750-word document; it does not have a legal/constitutional structure – instead, it reads more like a manifesto. The document called for severing ties with the British and claimed ‘Purna Swaraj’ or completes independence. It indicted British rule and succinctly articulated the resulting economic, political and cultural injustice inflicted on Indians. The document spoke on behalf of Indians and made its intention of launching the civil disobedience movement clear&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cadindia.clpr.org.in/historical_constitutions/declaration_of_purna_swaraj__indian_national_congress__1930__26th%20January%201930|title=CADIndia|website=cadindia.clpr.org.in|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Authorship==
There is some dispute as to who drafted the text of the declaration. Gandhi directly claimed authorship in 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gandhi's Philosophy and the Quest for Harmony|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MQhz0fW0HZUC|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2006-08-10|isbn = 9780521867153|first = Anthony|last = Parel|page = 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other sources either cite Nehru as a major editor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gandhi's Passion: The Life and Legacy of Mahatma Gandhi|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KpBy6BCupe4C|publisher = Oxford University Press, USA|date = 2002-11-28|isbn = 9780195156348|first = Stanley|last = Wolpert|page = 141}}&lt;/ref&gt; or attribute it to Nehru outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Political Leadership, Nascent Statehood and Democracy: A Comparative Study|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uKbAAwAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2014-06-05|isbn = 9781317673101|first = Ulrika|last = Möller|first2 = Isabell|last2 = Schierenbeck|page = 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Congress regularly observed 26 January as the Independence Day of India – commemorating those who campaigned for Indian independence. In 1947, the British agreed to transfer power and political finesse to India, and 15 August became the official Independence Day. However, the new [[Constitution of India]], as drafted and approved by the [[Constituent Assembly]], was mandated to take effect on 26 January 1950, to commemorate the 1930 declaration. On that day in 1950, India became a republic. 26 January is now celebrated as [[Republic Day of India]] every year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1903">'''Qualimetry''' is a scientific discipline which concerns itself with the methods and problems of quantification of the quality of any object: things or processes, whether natural or man-made, products of labour or nature, whether living or inanimate,  etc.&lt;ref&gt;Azgaldov, G. G. (1982), Theory and Practice of Product  Quality Assessment: Fundamentals of Qualimetry, Ekonomika,  Moscow (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a scientific theory of the quantitative determination of quality developed in the former USSR by G.G.Azgaldov&lt;ref&gt;Azgaldov, G.G. (1981), "Development of the theoretical basis of qualimetry", doctoral dissertation, Kuibyshev Military Engineering Academy, Moscow (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt; and currently used in development of Russian standards&lt;ref&gt;Product Quality (1979), Product Quality: Terms and Definitions. -  GOST 15467 – 79.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[GOST]]),  etc.

==Discussion==
"The term qualimetry (from the Latin [[quale]], “of what kind”), which designates a scientific discipline studying the methodology and problems of quantitative assessment of the quality of any kind of object (primarily, products), was first used in 1968.  That this initiative was timely and justifiable was borne out by a series of international scholarly conferences fully or partly devoted to issues of qualimetry, e.g., in [[Moscow]], [[Oslo]], [[Varna]], [[Yerevan]], [[Madrid]] or [[Tallinn]]. 
The term qualimetry is being gradually admitted into the scientific and engineering vocabularies of many countries. According to Google, tens of thousands of references to publications in 32 languages contain this term. " &lt;ref&gt;Azgaldov, G.G. and Kostin, A.V. (2011), "Applied Qualimetry: its Origins, Errors and Misconceptions", Benchmarking: An International Journal, Vol. 18 Iss: 3, pp.428 – 444.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the four sacred [[canon (disambiguation) | canonical]] texts (''[[śruti]]'') of [[Hinduism]] known as the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name=witzelthreefour&gt;[[Michael Witzel]] (1997), [http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/canon.pdf The Development of the Vedic Canon and its Schools : The Social and Political Milieu], Harvard University, in {{Harvnb|Witzel|1997|pp= 259–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antonio de Nicholas (2003), Meditations Through the Rig Veda: Four-Dimensional Man, {{ISBN|978-0595269259}}, page 273&lt;/ref&gt; 

The core text, known as the ''Rigveda Samhita'', is a collection of 1,028 hymns (''{{IAST|sūkta}}''s) in about 10,600 verses (called ''{{IAST|ṛc}}'', eponymous of the name ''Rigveda''), organized into ten books (''{{IAST|maṇḍala}}''s).

==Text==

===Organization===

====Mandalas====
The text is organized in ten "books", or ''[[mandala|maṇḍala]]''s ("circles"), of varying age and length.{{Sfn|George Erdosy|1995|pp=68-69}}
The text clearly originates as [[oral literature]], and "books" may be a misleading term, the individual mandalas are, much rather, standalone collections of hymns that were intended to be memorized by the members of various [[Vedic priests|groups of priests]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Rigveda is not a book, but a library and a literature." 
Arnold, Edward Vernon (2009), [https://archive.org/stream/vedicmetreinitsh00arnouoft#page/viii/mode/2up Vedic Metre in its historical development], Cambridge University Press (Original Pub: 1905), {{ISBN|978-1113224446}}, page ix&lt;/ref&gt;

This is particularly true of the "family books",  mandalas 2–7, which form the oldest part of the Rigveda and account for 38% of the entire text. They are called "family books" because each of them is  attributed to an individual [[rishi]],
and was transmitted within the lineage of this rishi's family, or of his students.&lt;ref name="Holdrege2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara A. Holdrege|title=Veda and Torah: Transcending the Textuality of Scripture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlvikndgEmIC |year=2012|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-0695-4|pages=229–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The hymns within each of the family books are arranged in collections each dealing with a particular deity: ''Agni'' comes first, ''Indra'' comes second, and so on. They are generally arranged by decreasing number of hymns within each section.&lt;ref name=pincott598&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pincott | first=Frederic | title=The First Maṇḍala of the Ṛig-Veda | journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | volume=19 | issue=4 | year=1887 | pages=598–624 | doi=10.1017/s0035869x00019717 }}

Within each such collection, the hymns are arranged in descending order of the number of stanzas per hymn. If two hymns in the same collection have equal numbers of stanzas then they are arranged so that the number of syllables in the metre are in descending order.{{Sfn|George Erdosy|1995|pp=68-69, 180-189}}{{Sfn|Gregory Possehl|Michael Witzel|2002|pp=391-393}} The second to seventh mandalas have a uniform format.&lt;ref name=pincott598/&gt;

The [[Mandala 8|eighth]] and [[Mandala 9|ninth]] mandalas, comprising hymns of mixed age, account for 15% and 9%, respectively. The ninth manadala is entirely dedicated to [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] and the [[Soma ritual]].
The hymns in the  ninth mandala are arranged by both their prosody  structure ([[chanda]]) and by their length.&lt;ref name=pincott598/&gt;

The [[Mandala 1|first]] and the [[Mandala 10|tenth]] mandalas are the youngest; they are also the longest books, of 191 suktas each, accounting for 37% of the text. Nevertheless, some of the hymns in mandalas 8, 1 and 10 may still belong to an earlier period and may be as old as the material in the family books.{{Sfn|Bryant|2001|pp=66-67}} 
The first mandala has a unique arrangement not found in the other nine mandalas. The first 84 hymns of the tenth mandala have a structure different than the remaining hymns in it.&lt;ref name=pincott598/&gt;

====Prosody====
Each mandala consists of hymns or ''{{IAST|sūkta}}''s (''{{IAST|[[su-]] + [[Vāc|ukta]]}}'', literally, "well recited, [[:wikt:eulogy|eulogy]]") intended for various [[Yajna|ritual]]s. 
The {{IAST|sūkta}}s in turn consist of individual stanzas called ''{{IAST|ṛc}}'' ("praise", ''pl.'' ''{{IAST|ṛcas}}''), which are further analysed into units of verse called ''{{IAST|[[pada (foot)|pada]]}}'' ("[[Foot (poetry)|foot]]" or step).

The [[Sanskrit prosody|meters]] most used in the {{IAST|ṛcas}} are the [[gayatri]] (3 verses of 8 syllables), [[anushtubh]] (4x8), [[trishtubh]] (4x11) and [[Vedic meter|jagati]] (4x12). The trishtubh meter (40%) and gayatri meter (25%) dominate in the Rigveda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kireet Joshi| title=The Veda and Indian Culture: An Introductory Essay| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CJlM2nhlt0C| year=1991| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass| isbn=978-81-208-0889-8|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/historyofsanskri00macdrich#page/56/mode/2up A history of Sanskrit Literature], Arthur MacDonell, Oxford University Press/Appleton &amp; Co, page 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephanie W. Jamison|author2=Joel P. Brereton|title=The Rigveda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-PRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-937018-4|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For pedagogical convenience, each mandala is divided into roughly equal sections of several sūktas, called ''{{IAST|anuvāka}}'' ("recitation"), which modern publishers often omit. 
Another scheme divides the entire text over the 10 mandalas into ''{{IAST|aṣṭaka}}'' ("eighth"), ''{{IAST|adhyāya}}'' ("chapter") and ''{{IAST|varga}}'' ("class"). Some publishers give both classifications in a single edition.

The most common numbering scheme is by book, hymn and stanza (and pada ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' ..., if required). E.g., the first verse is in three times eight syllables (gayatri):
: 1.1.1a ''{{IAST|agn&amp;iacute;m  ī&amp;#x301;ḷe pur&amp;oacute;hitaṃ}}''  1b ''{{IAST|yajñ&amp;aacute;sya dev&amp;aacute;ṃ ṛtv&amp;iacute;jam}}'' 1c ''{{IAST|h&amp;oacute;tāraṃ ratna-dhā&amp;#x301;tamam}}''
:"[[Agni]] I invoke, the [[purohita|house-priest]] / the [[Deva (Hinduism)|god]], minister of [[Yajna|sacrifice]] / the [[hotar|presiding priest]], bestower of wealth."

===Composers===
{{See also|Anukramani}}

Tradition associates a [[rishi]] (the composer) with each {{IAST|ṛc}} of the Rigveda.&lt;ref&gt;In a few cases, more than one rishi is given, signifying lack of certainty.&lt;/ref&gt; Most sūktas are attributed to single composers. The "family books" (2–7) are so-called because they have hymns by members of the same clan in each book; but other clans are also represented in the Rigveda. In all, 10 families of rishis account for more than 95% of the {{IAST|ṛcs}}; for each of them the Rigveda includes a lineage-specific ''{{IAST|āprī}}'' hymn (a special sūkta of rigidly formulaic structure, used for rituals.

===Transmission===
The original text (as authored by the [[Rishi]]s) is close to but not identical to the extant ''Samhitapatha'', but metrical and other observations allow reconstruction (in part at least) of the original text from the extant one, as printed in the [[Harvard Oriental Series]], vol. 50 (1994).&lt;ref&gt;B. van Nooten and G. Holland, Rig Veda. A metrically restored text. Cambridge: Harvard Oriental Series 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving form of the Rigveda is based on an early [[Iron Age India|Iron Age]] collection that established the core 'family books' (mandalas [[Mandala 2|2]]–[[Mandala 7|7]], ordered by author, deity and meter &lt;ref&gt;H. Oldenberg, Prolegomena,1888, Engl. transl. New Delhi: Motilal 2004&lt;/ref&gt;) and a later redaction, co-eval with the redaction of the other [[Veda]]s, dating several centuries after the hymns were composed. This redaction also included some additions (contradicting the strict ordering scheme) and [[orthoepic]] changes to the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] such as the [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] of [[sandhi]] (termed ''orthoepische Diaskeuase'' by Oldenberg, 1888).

As with the other Vedas, the redacted text has been handed down in several versions, most importantly the ''[[Padapatha]]'', in which each word is isolated in [[pausa]] form and is used for just one way of memorization; and the ''[[Samhitapatha]]'', which combines words according to the rules of sandhi (the process being described in the ''[[Pratisakhya]]'') and is the memorized text used for recitation.

The ''Padapatha'' and the ''Pratisakhya'' anchor the text's true meaning,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Indian Linguistic Studies: Festschrift in Honor of George Cardona |editors = George Cardona, Madhav Deshpande, Peter Edwin Hook| author = K.

This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is, in fact, something like a tape-recording of ca. 1500–500 BC. Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present. On the other hand, the Vedas have been written down only during the early second millennium ce,...}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve this the oral tradition prescribed very structured enunciation, involving breaking down the Sanskrit [[compound word|compound]]s into [[word stem|stem]]s and inflections, as well as certain permutations. This interplay with sounds gave rise to a [[Vyākaraṇa|scholarly tradition]] of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[phonetics]]. The Rigveda was probably not written down until the [[Gupta period]] (4th to 6th centuries AD), by which time the [[Brahmi script]] had become widespread (the oldest surviving manuscripts are from AD ~1040, discovered in [[Nepal]]).&lt;ref name=witzelthreefour/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The oldest manuscript in the Pune collection dates to the 15th century. The [[Benares Sanskrit University]] has a Rigveda manuscript of the 14th century. Earlier manuscripts are extremely rare; the oldest known manuscript preserving a Vedic text was written in the 11th century in Nepal (catalogued by the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project, Hamburg.&lt;/ref&gt; The oral tradition still continued into recent times.
 
There is a widely accepted timeframe for the initial codification of the ''Rigveda'' by compiling the hymns very late in the Rigvedic or rather in the early post-Rigvedic period, including the arrangement of the individual hymns in ten books, coeval with the composition of the younger Veda Samhitas. This time coincides with the early [[Kuru (India)|Kuru]] kingdom, shifting the center of Vedic culture east from the Punjab into what is now [[Uttar Pradesh]]. 
The fixing of the samhitapatha (by enforcing regular application of [[sandhi]])  and of the padapatha (by dissolving Sandhi out of the earlier metrical text), occurred during the later Brahmana period, in roughly the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/rigvedabrahanasa00keit#page/44/mode/2up|title=Rigveda Brahmanas: the Aitareya and Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇas of the Rigveda|last=Keith|first=Arthur Berriedale|date=1920|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1920|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=44|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recensions===
Several [[shakha]]s ("branches", i. e. recensions) of Rig Veda are known to have existed in the past. Of these, Śākalya is the only one to have survived in its entirety. Another shakha that may have survived is the Bāṣkala, although this is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Witzel says that "The RV has been transmitted in one recension (the ''śākhā'' of Śākalya) while others (such as the Bāṣkala text) have been lost or are only rumored about so far."  Michael Witzel, p. 69, "Vedas and Upaniṣads", in: ''The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism'', Gavin Flood (ed.), Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Winternitz (''History of Sanskrit Literature'', Revised English Translation Edition, 1926, vol. 1, p. 57)  says that "Of the different recensions of this Saṃhitā, which once existed, only a single one has come down to us." He adds in a note (p. 57, note 1) that this refers to the "recension of the Śākalaka-School."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sures Chandra Banerji (''A Companion To Sanskrit Literature'', Second Edition, 1989, Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, pp. 300–301) says that "Of the 21 recensions of this Veda, that were known at one time, we have got only two, viz. ''Śākala'' and ''Vāṣkala''."&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving padapatha version of the Rigveda text is ascribed to Śākalya.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Winternitz (''History of Sanskrit Literature'', Revised English Translation Edition, 1926, vol. 1, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; The {{IAST|Śākala}} recension has 1,017 regular hymns, and an appendix of 11 ''{{IAST|[[valakhilya|vālakhilya]]}}'' hymns&lt;ref&gt;Mantras of "khila" hymns were called ''khailika'' and not {{IAST|ṛcas}} (''Khila'' meant distinct "part" of Rgveda separate from regular hymns; all regular hymns make up the ''akhila'' or "the whole" recognised in a śākhā, although khila hymns have sanctified roles in rituals from ancient times).&lt;/ref&gt; which are now customarily included in the 8th mandala (as 8.49–8.59), for a total of 1028 hymns.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermann Grassmann]] had numbered the hymns 1 through to 1028, putting the {{IAST|vālakhilya}} at the end. Griffith's translation has these 11 at the end of the 8th mandala, after 8.92 in the regular series.&lt;/ref&gt; The {{IAST|Bāṣkala}} recension includes 8 of these {{IAST|vālakhilya}} hymns among its regular hymns, making a total of 1025 regular hymns for this śākhā.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Preface to Khila section by C.G.Kāshikar in Volume-5 of Pune Edition of RV (in references).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the {{IAST|Bāṣkala}} recension has its own appendix of 98 hymns, the [[Khilani]].&lt;ref&gt;These Khilani hymns have also been found in a manuscript of the {{IAST|Śākala}} recension of the Kashmir Rigveda (and are included in the Poone edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1877 edition of Aufrecht, the 1028 hymns of the Rigveda contain a total of 10,552 {{IAST|ṛc}}s, or 39,831 padas. The [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] gives the number of syllables to be 432,000,&lt;ref&gt;equalling 40 times 10,800, the number of bricks used for the ''[[uttaravedi]]'': the number is motivated numerologically rather than based on an actual syllable count.&lt;/ref&gt; while the metrical text of van Nooten and Holland (1994) has a total of 395,563 syllables (or an average of 9.93 syllables per pada); counting the number of syllables is not straightforward because of issues with sandhi and the post-Rigvedic pronunciation of syllables like súvar as svàr.

Three other shakhas are mentioned in ''Caraṇavyuha'', a [[pariśiṣṭa]] (supplement) of Yajurveda: Māṇḍukāyana, Aśvalāyana and Śaṅkhāyana. The Atharvaveda lists two more shakhas. The differences between all these shakhas are very minor, limited to varying order of content and inclusion (or non-inclusion) of a few verses. The following information is known about the shakhas other than Śākalya and Bāṣkala:{{Sfn|Stephanie W. Jamison| Joel P. Brereton|2014|p=16}}

* Māṇḍukāyana: Perhaps the oldest of the Rigvedic shakhas.
* Aśvalāyana: Includes 212 verses, all of which are newer than the other Rigvedic hymns.
* Śaṅkhāyana: Very similar to Aśvalāyana
* Saisiriya: Mentioned in the Rigveda [[Pratisakhya]]. Very similar to Śākala, with a few additional verses; might have derived from or merged with it.

Some Rigveda commentaries may date from the second half of the first millennium AD. The hymns were thus composed and preserved by [[oral tradition]] for several&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton (2014), The Rigveda : the earliest religious poetry of India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199370184}}, pages 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; millennia from the time of their composition until the redaction of the Rigveda, and the entire Rigveda was preserved in [[shakha]]s for another 2,500 years from the time of its redaction until the ''editio princeps'' by Rosen, Aufrecht and Max Müller.

====Versions====
There are, for example, 30 manuscripts of Rigveda at the [[Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute]], collected in the 19th century by [[Georg Bühler]], Franz Kielhorn and others, originating from different parts of India, including [[Kashmir]], [[Gujarat]], the then [[Rajaputana]], [[Central Provinces]] etc. They were transferred to [[Deccan College (Pune)|Deccan College]], [[Pune]], in the late 19th century. They are in the [[Sharada script|Sharada]] and [[Devanagari]] scripts, written on birch bark and paper. The oldest of them is dated to 1464. The 30 manuscripts of Rigveda preserved at the [[Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute]], [[Pune]] were added to [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=rigveda&gt;{{cite web | title= Rigveda | url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22389&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20140117181848/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication%2Dand%2Dinformation/flagship%2Dproject%2Dactivities/memory%2Dof%2Dthe%2Dworld/homepage/ | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 2014-01-17 | publisher= [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Programme]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hinduism.about.com/od/scripturesepics/a/rigveda.htm |title=Rig Veda in UNESCO's 'Memory of the World' Register |website=Hinduism.about.com |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of these 30 manuscripts, 9 contain the samhita text, 5 have the [[padapatha]] in addition. 13 contain Sayana's commentary. At least 5 manuscripts (MS. no. 1/A1879-80, 1/A1881-82, 331/1883-84 and 5/Viś I) have preserved the complete text of the Rigveda. MS no. 5/1875-76, written on birch bark in bold Sharada, was only in part used by [[Max Müller]] for his edition of the Rigveda with Sayana's commentary.

Müller used 24 manuscripts then available to him in Europe, while the Pune Edition used over five dozen manuscripts, but the editors of Pune Edition could not procure many manuscripts used by Müller and by the Bombay Edition, as well as from some other sources; hence the total number of extant manuscripts known then must surpass perhaps eighty at least.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Editorial notes in various volumes of Pune Edition, see references.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Comparison====
The various Rigveda manuscripts discovered so far show some differences. Broadly, the most studied Śākala recension has 1017 hymns, includes an appendix of eleven ''valakhīlya'' hymns which are often counted with the 8th mandala, for a total of 1,028 metrical hymns. The Bāṣakala version of Rigveda includes eight of these ''vālakhilya'' hymns among its regular hymns, making a total of 1025 hymns in the main text for this śākhā. The Bāṣakala text also has an appendix of 98 hymns, called the ''Khilani'', bringing the total to 1,123 hymns. The manuscripts of Śākala recension of the Rigveda have about 10,600 verses, organized into ten Books (''Mandalas'').{{sfn|Avari|2007|p=77}}&lt;ref name=hastings/&gt; Books 2 through 7 are internally homogeneous in style, while Books 1, 8 and 10 are compilation of verses of internally different styles suggesting that these books are likely a collection of compositions by many authors.&lt;ref name=hastings/&gt;

The first mandala is the largest, with 191 hymns and 2,006 verses, and it was added to the text after Books 2 through 9. The last, or the 10th Book, also has 191 hymns but 1,754 verses, making it the second largest. The language analytics suggest the 10th Book, chronologically, was composed and added last.&lt;ref name=hastings/&gt; The content of the 10th Book also suggest that the authors knew and relied on the contents of the first nine books.&lt;ref name=hastings/&gt;

The Rigveda is the largest of the four Vedas, and many of its verses appear in the other Vedas.&lt;ref name=nicholas273/&gt; Almost all of the 1,875 verses found in [[Samaveda]] are taken from different parts of the Rigveda, either once or as repetition, and rewritten in a chant song form. The Books 8 and 9 of the Rigveda are by far the largest source of verses for Sama Veda. The Book 10 contributes the largest number of the 1,350 verses of Rigveda found in [[Atharvaveda]], or about one fifth of the 5,987 verses in the Atharvaveda text.&lt;ref name=hastings&gt;James Hastings, {{Google book|5D4TAAAAYAAJ|Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics}}, Vol. 7, Harvard Divinity School, TT Clark, pages 51-56&lt;/ref&gt; A bulk of 1,875 ritual-focussed verses of [[Yajurveda]], in its numerous versions, also borrow and build upon the foundation of verses in Rigveda.&lt;ref name=nicholas273&gt;Antonio de Nicholas (2003), Meditations Through the Rig Veda: Four-Dimensional Man, {{ISBN|978-0595269259}}, pages 273-274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Gosse, {{Google books|xco9AQAAIAAJ|Short histories of the literatures of the world|page=181}}, New York: Appleton, page 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Altogether the Rigveda consists of:
*the ''[[Samhita]]'' (hymns to the deities, the oldest part of the Rigveda)
*the ''[[Brahmana]]''s, commentaries on the hymns
*the  ''[[Aranyaka]]''s or "forest books"
*the  ''[[Upanishads|Upanishad]]''s
In western usage, "Rigveda" usually refers to the Rigveda Samhita, while the Brahmanas are referred to as the "Rigveda Brahmanas" (etc.). Technically speaking, however, "the Rigveda" refers to the entire body of texts transmitted along with the Samhita portion. Different bodies of commentary were transmitted in the different [[shakha]]s or "schools".
Only a small portion of these texts has been preserved: The texts of only two out of five shakhas  mentioned by the [[Pratishakhyas|Rigveda  Pratishakhya]] have survived.
The late (15th or 16th century) ''[[Shri Guru Charitra]]'' even claims the existence of twelve Rigvedic shakhas.
The two surviving Rigvedic corpora are those of the '' Śākala'' and the '' Bāṣkala'' shakhas.

===Hymns===
{{See also|Rigvedic deities}}
The Rigvedic hymns are dedicated to various deities, chief of whom are [[Indra]], a heroic god praised for having slain his enemy [[Vrtra]]; [[Agni]], the sacrificial fire; and [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], the sacred potion or the plant it is made from. Equally prominent gods are the [[Adityas]] or Asura gods [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]]–[[Varuna]] and [[Ushas]] (the dawn). Also invoked are [[Savitr]], [[Vishnu]], [[Rudra]], [[Pushan]], [[Brihaspati]] or [[Brahmanaspati]], as well as deified natural phenomena such as [[Dyaus Pita]] (the shining sky, Father Heaven), [[Prithivi]] (the earth, Mother Earth), [[Surya]] (the sun god), [[Vayu]] or Vata (the wind), [[Ap (water)|Apas]] (the waters), [[Parjanya]] (the thunder and rain), [[Vāc|Vac]] (the word), many [[Rigvedic rivers|rivers]] (notably the [[Sapta Sindhu]], and the [[Sarasvati River]]). The [[Adityas]], Vasus, Rudras, Sadhyas, [[Ashvins]], [[Maruts]], [[Rbhus]], and the [[Vishvadevas]] ("all-gods") as well as the "thirty-three gods" are the groups of deities mentioned.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

* [[Mandala 1]] comprises 191 hymns. Hymn 1.1 is addressed to [[Agni]], and his name is the first word of the ''Rigveda''. The remaining hymns are mainly addressed to Agni and [[Indra]], as well as Varuna, Mitra, the Ashvins, the Maruts, Usas, Surya, Rbhus, Rudra, Vayu, Brhaspati, Visnu, Heaven and Earth, and all the Gods. This Mandala is dated to have been added to Rigveda after Mandala 2 through 9, and includes the philosophical Riddle Hymn 1.164, which inspires chapters in later Upanishads such as the [[Mundaka Upanishad|Mundaka]].&lt;ref name=jamisonbrereton&gt;Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton (2014), The Rigveda : the earliest religious poetry of India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199370184}}, pages 4, 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hume, [https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n395/mode/2up Mundaka Upanishad], Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 374-375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/38/mode/2up Mundaka Upanishad], Oxford University Press, page 38-40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rigveda Brahmanas===
{{See also|Brahmana}}
Of the Brahmanas that were handed down in the schools of the ''{{IAST|Bahvṛcas}}'' (i.e. "possessed of many verses"), as the followers of the Rigveda are called, two have come down to us, namely those of the Aitareyins and the Kaushitakins. The ''[[Aitareya-brahmana]]''&lt;ref&gt;Edited, with an English translation, by M. Haug (2 vols., Bombay, 1863). An edition in Roman transliteration, with extracts from the commentary, has been published by Th. Aufrecht (Bonn, 1879).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kaushitaki-brahmana|''Kaushitaki-'' (or ''Sankhayana-'') ''brahmana'']] evidently have for their groundwork the same stock of traditional exegetic matter. They differ, however, considerably as regards both the arrangement of this matter and their stylistic handling of it, with the exception of the numerous legends common to both, in which the discrepancy is comparatively slight. There is also a certain amount of material peculiar to each of them.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[File:1500-1200 BCE, Devi sukta, Rigveda 10.125.1-2, Sanskrit, Devanagari, manuscript page 1735 CE (1792 VS).jpg|thumb|left|Devi sukta, which highlights the goddess tradition of Hinduism is found in Rigveda hymns 10.125. It is cited in ''[[Devi Mahatmya]]'' and is recited every year during the [[Durga Puja]] festival.]]
The Kaushitaka is, upon the whole, far more concise in its style and more systematic in its arrangement features which would lead one to infer that it is probably the more modern work of the two. It consists of thirty chapters (''adhyaya''); while the Aitareya has forty, divided into eight books (or pentads, ''pancaka''), of five chapters each. The last ten adhyayas of the latter work are, however, clearly a later addition though they must have already formed part of it at the time of [[Pāṇini]] (c. 5th century BC), if, as seems probable, one of his grammatical sutras, regulating the formation of the names of Brahmanas, consisting of thirty and forty adhyayas, refers to these two works. In this last portion occurs the well-known legend (also found in the Shankhayana-sutra, but not in the Kaushitaki-brahmana) of [[Shunahshepa]], whom his father Ajigarta sells and offers to slay, the recital of which formed part of the inauguration of kings.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

While the Aitareya deals almost exclusively with the Soma sacrifice, the Kaushitaka, in its first six chapters, treats of the several kinds of ''haviryajna'', or offerings of rice, milk, ghee, etc., whereupon follows the Soma sacrifice in this way, that chapters 7–10 contain the practical ceremonial and 11–30 the recitations (''shastra'') of the hotar. Sayana, in the introduction to his commentary on the work, ascribes the Aitareya to the sage Mahidasa Aitareya (i.e. son of Itara), also mentioned elsewhere as a philosopher; and it seems likely enough that this person arranged the Brahmana and founded the school of the Aitareyins. Regarding the authorship of the sister work we have no information, except that the opinion of the sage Kaushitaki is frequently referred to in it as authoritative, and generally in opposition to the Paingya—the Brahmana, it would seem, of a rival school, the Paingins. Probably, therefore, it is just what one of the manuscripts calls it—the Brahmana of Sankhayana (composed) in accordance with the views of Kaushitaki.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

===Rigveda Aranyakas and Upanishads===
{{See also|Aranyaka|Upanishads}}
Each of these two Brahmanas is supplemented by a "forest book", or [[Aranyaka]]. The ''Aitareyaranyaka'' is not a uniform production. It consists of five books (''aranyaka''), three of which, the first and the last two, are of a liturgical nature, treating of the ceremony called ''mahavrata'', or great vow. The last of these books, composed in sutra form, is, however, doubtless of later origin, and is, indeed, ascribed by Hindu authorities either to Shaunaka or to Ashvalayana. The second and third books, on the other hand, are purely speculative, and are also styled the ''Bahvrca-brahmana-upanishad''. Again, the last four chapters of the second book are usually singled out as the [[Aitareya Upanishad]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 7-14&lt;/ref&gt; ascribed, like its Brahmana (and the first book), to Mahidasa Aitareya; and the third book is also referred to as the ''Samhita-upanishad''. As regards the ''Kaushitaki-aranyaka'', this work consists of 15 adhyayas, the first two (treating of the mahavrata ceremony) and the 7th and 8th of which correspond to the 1st, 5th, and 3rd books of the Aitareyaranyaka, respectively, whilst the four adhyayas usually inserted between them constitute the highly interesting [[Kaushitaki Upanishad|Kaushitaki (Brahmana-) Upanishad]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 21–23&lt;/ref&gt; of which we possess two different recensions. The remaining portions (9–15) of the Aranyaka treat of the vital airs, the internal Agnihotra, etc., ending with the ''vamsha'', or succession of teachers.

==Dating and historical context==
{{see|Historical Vedic religion|Vedic period|Proto-Indo-Aryan}}
[[Image:Map of Vedic India.png|thumb|320px|Geographical distribution of the Vedic era texts. Each of major regions had their own recension of Rig Veda (''Sakhas''), and the versions varied. The Kuru versions were more orthodox, but evidence suggests Vedic era people of other parts of Northern India had challenged the Kuru orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=witzelthreefour/&gt;]]

The [[Vedic Sanskrit]] text of the redacted version of the Rig Veda was transmitted remarkably unchanged, preserving, apart from certain prosodic changes (the systematic application of [[sandhi]] rules) the linguistic stage of the Late Bronze Age.
Because of the faithful preservation of the text, the language was no longer immediately understandable to scholars of [[Classical Sanskrit]] by about 500 BC, necessitating commentaries interpreting the meaning of the text of the hymns.&lt;ref name="KT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigveda.co.uk/speak-for-itself.pdf |format=PDF |title=Speak for itself |website=Rigveda.co.uk |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Brahmanas contain numerous misinterpretations, due to this linguistic change,&lt;ref name="KT" /&gt; some of which were characterised by [[Sri Aurobindo]] as "grotesque nonsense."&lt;ref name="KT" /&gt;

The earliest text were composed in greater Punjab (northwest India and Pakistan), and the more philosophical later texts were most likely composed in or around the region that is the modern era state of [[Haryana]].&lt;ref name="Joel Brereton 2014 page 5"&gt;Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton (2014), The Rigveda : the earliest religious poetry of India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199370184}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Philological estimates tend to date the bulk of the text to the second half of the second millennium.{{refn|group=note|Compare [[Max Müller]]'s statement  "the hymns of the Rig-Veda are said to date from 1500 BC"&lt;ref&gt;('Veda and Vedanta', 7th lecture   in ''India: What Can It Teach Us: A Course of Lectures Delivered Before the University of Cambridge'', World Treasures of the Library of Congress Beginnings by Irene U. Chambers, Michael S. Roth.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Being composed in an early [[Old Indo-Aryan|Indo-Aryan]] language, the hymns must post-date the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian|Indo-Iranian]] separation, dated to roughly 2000 BC.{{Sfn|Mallory|1989}} A reasonable date close to that of the composition of the core of the Rigveda is that of the Mitanni documents of c. 1400 BC, which contain [[Indo-Aryan superstrate in Mitanni|Indo-Aryan nomenclature]].&lt;ref&gt;"As a possible date ad quem for the RV one usually adduces the Hittite-Mitanni agreement of the middle of the 14th cent.

The Rigveda's core is accepted to date to the late [[Bronze Age]], making it one of the few examples with an unbroken tradition. Its composition is usually dated to roughly between c. 1500–1200 BC.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=37}}{{sfn|Witzel|1995|p=4}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=454}}{{refn|group=note|Oberlies (1998:155) gives an estimate of 1100 BC for the youngest hymns in book 10.

The [[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]] (s.v. [[Indo-Iranian languages]], p.&amp;nbsp;306) gives 1500–1000 BC.}}

The ''Rigveda'' is far more archaic than any other Indo-Aryan text. For this reason, it was in the center of attention of western scholarship from the times of [[Max Müller]] and [[Rudolf Roth]] onwards. The ''Rigveda'' records an early stage of [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]]. There are strong linguistic and cultural similarities with the [[Early Iranian languages|early Iranian]] [[Avesta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Oldenberg|1894}} (tr. Shrotri), p. 14 "The Vedic diction has a great number of favourite expressions which are common with the Avestic, though not with later Indian diction. In addition, there is a close resemblance between them in metrical form, in fact, in their overall poetic character. If it is noticed that whole Avesta verses can be easily translated into the Vedic alone by virtue of comparative phonetics, then this may often give, not only correct Vedic words and phrases, but also the verses, out of which the soul of Vedic poetry appears to speak."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Bryant|2001|pp=130–131}} "The oldest part of the Avesta... is linguistically and culturally very close to the material preserved in the Rigveda... There seems to be economic and religious interaction and perhaps rivalry operating here, which justifies scholars in placing the Vedic and Avestan worlds in close chronological, geographical and cultural proximity to each other not far removed from a joint Indo-Iranian period."&lt;/ref&gt; deriving from the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] times,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Mallory|1989}} p. 36 "Probably the least-contested observation concerning the various Indo-European dialects is that those languages grouped together as Indic and Iranian show such remarkable similarities with one another that we can confidently posit a period of Indo-Iranian unity..."&lt;/ref&gt; often associated with the early [[Andronovo culture]] (or rather, the [[Sintashta culture]] within the early Andronovo horizon) of c. 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Mallory|1989}} "The identification of the Andronovo culture as Indo-Iranian is commonly accepted by scholars."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rigveda offers no direct evidence of social or political system in Vedic era, whether ordinary or elite.&lt;ref name=jamison57&gt;Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton (2014), The Rigveda : the earliest religious poetry of India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199370184}}, pages 57-59&lt;/ref&gt; Only hints such as cattle raising and horse racing are discernible, and the text offers very general ideas about the ancient Indian society.

The women of Rigveda are quite outspoken and appear more sexually confident than men, in the text.&lt;ref name=jamison57/&gt; Elaborate and esthetic hymns on wedding suggest rites of passage had developed during the Rigvedic period.&lt;ref name=jamison57/&gt; There is little evidence of [[dowry]] and no evidence of [[Sati (practice)|sati]] in it or related Vedic texts.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Witzel (1996), Little Dowry, No Sati: The Lot of Women in the Vedic Period, Journal of South Asia Women Studies, Vol 2, No. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rigvedic hymns mention [[rice]] and porridge, in hymns such as 8.83, 8.70, 8.77 and 1.61 in some versions of the text,&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton (2014), The Rigveda : the earliest religious poetry of India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199370184}}, pages 40, 180, 1150, 1162&lt;/ref&gt; however there is no discussion of rice cultivation.&lt;ref name=jamison7/&gt; The term "ayas" (metal) occurs in the Rigveda, but it is unclear which metal it was.&lt;ref&gt;Chakrabarti, D.K. The Early Use of Iron in India (1992) [[Oxford University Press]] argues that it may refer to any metal. If ayas refers to iron, the Rigveda must date to the late 2nd millennium at the earliest.&lt;/ref&gt; Iron is not mentioned in Rigveda, something scholars have used to help date Rigveda to have been composed before 1000 BC.&lt;ref name="Joel Brereton 2014 page 5"/&gt; Hymn 5.63 mentions "metal cloaked in gold", suggesting metal working had progressed in the Vedic culture.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton (2014), The Rigveda : the earliest religious poetry of India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199370184}}, page 744&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the names of [[Rigvedic deities|gods and goddesses]] found in the ''Rigveda'' are found amongst other belief systems based on [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], while words used share common [[Proto-Indo-European root|roots]] with words from other [[Indo-European languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton (2014), The Rigveda : the earliest religious poetry of India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199370184}}, pages 50-57&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[horse]] ([[ashva]]), [[cattle]], sheep and goat play an important role in the Rigveda. There are also references to the [[elephant]] ([[Hastin]], Varana), [[camel]] (Ustra, especially in [[Mandala 8]]), ass (khara, rasabha), [[Domestic buffalo|buffalo]] (Mahisa), [[wolf]], [[hyena]], [[lion]] (Simha), mountain goat (sarabha) and to the [[gaur]] in the Rigveda.&lt;ref&gt;among others, Macdonell and Keith, and Talageri 2000, Lal 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The [[peafowl]] (mayura), the goose ([[hamsa (bird)|hamsa]]) and the [[chakravaka]] (''[[Tadorna ferruginea]]'') are some birds mentioned in the Rigveda.

==Reception in Hinduism==
{{Hindu scriptures}}

===Shruti===
The Vedas as a whole are classed as "[[shruti]]" in Hindu tradition.
This has been compared to the concept of [[divine revelation]] in Western religious tradition, 
but Staal argues that  "it is nowhere stated that the Veda was revealed", and that ''shruti'' simply means "that what is heard, in the sense that it is transmitted from father to son or from teacher to pupil".&lt;ref name=fritsstaal/&gt; 
The Rigveda, or other Vedas, do not anywhere assert that they are [[apauruṣeyā]], and this reverential term appears only centuries after the end of the Vedic period in the texts of the [[Mimamsa]] school of Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref name=fritsstaal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D Sharma (2011), Classical Indian Philosophy: A Reader, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231133999}}, pages 196-197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Westerhoff (2009), Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195384963}}, page 290&lt;/ref&gt; 
The text of Rigveda suggests it was "composed by poets, human individuals whose names were household words" in the Vedic age, states Staal.&lt;ref name=fritsstaal&gt;Frits Staal (2009), ''Discovering the Vedas: Origins, Mantras, Rituals, Insights'', Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0143099864}}, pages xv-xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Hindu scholarship===
By the period of [[Puranic Hinduism]], in the medieval period, the language of the hymns had become "almost entirely unintelligible", and their interpretation mostly hinged on [[mysticism|mystical]] ideas and [[sound symbolism]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick M  Smith, 'Purāņaveda,' in Laurie L. Patton (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z8CGJBo3z4C&amp;pg=PA99 ''Authority, Anxiety, and Canon: Essays in Vedic Interpretation,''] SUNY Press 1994 p.99.
Arthur Llewellyn Basham, Kenneth G. Zysk, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2aqgTYlhLikC&amp;pg=PA7 ''The Origins and Development of Classical Hinduism ,''] Oxford University Press, 1989 p.7, Ram Gopal, [https://books.google.com/books?id=evY93w240isC&amp;pg=PA7 ''The History and Principles of Vedic Interpretation,''] Concept Publishing Company, 1983 ch.2 pp.7-20&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hindu tradition, the Rigvedic hymns along with the other Vedas, the ''Mahabharata'' and the ''Puranas'' were compiled by sage [[Vyasa|{{IAST|Vyāsa}}]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mystic Approach to the Veda and the Upanishad'' by Madhav Pundalik Pandit (1974), p. 4, {{ISBN|9780940985483}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana|{{IAST|Śatapatha Brāhmana}}]]'', the number of syllables in the ''Rigveda'' is 432,000, but the surviving Rigveda does not confirm this number. The Rigveda does have embedded numerical patterns such as 10,800 stanzas, which corresponds to 30 times 360, and a fourth of 432 that appears in many Hindu contexts (108 Upanishads). The ''Shatapatha Brahmana'' claims that there are 10,800,000 stars in the sky. According to Thomas McEvilley, an Art Historian and academic who compared Greek and Indian literature, the numbers such as 432 and 108 may be of significance to the Hindus, but many numerology claims do not verify and the "believer is left with the consolation of thinking that the missing" are there "but unmanifest".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas McEvilley (2012), ''The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies'', {{ISBN|9781581159332}}, pp. 154-155&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the [[Brahmanas|{{IAST|Brāhmana}}]] literature discussed and interpreted the Vedic ritual. [[Yaska]] was an early commentator of the ''Rigveda'' by discussing the meanings of difficult words. In the 14th century, [[Sayana|{{IAST|Sāyana}}]] wrote an exhaustive commentary on it.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

A number of other commentaries (''{{IAST|bhāṣya}}s'') were written during the medieval period, including the commentaries by [[Skandasvamin]] (pre-Sayana, roughly of the [[Gupta period]]), [[Udgatr|Udgitha]] (pre-Sayana), [[Venkata-Madhava]] (pre-Sayana, c. 10th to 12th centuries) and [[Mudgala Purana]] (after Sayana, an abbreviated version of Sayana's commentary).&lt;ref&gt;
edited in 8 volumes by [[Vishva Bandhu]], 1963–1966.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Arya Samaj and Aurobindo movements===
In the 19th- and early 20th-centuries, some reformers like [[Swami Dayananda Saraswati]] – founder of the [[Arya Samaj]], [[Sri Aurobindo]] – founder of [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]], discussed the Vedas, including the Rig veda, for their philosophies. According to Robson, Dayanand believed "there were no errors in the Vedas (including the Rigveda), and if anyone showed him an error, he would maintain that it was a corruption added later".&lt;ref name=salmond&gt;{{Cite book|author=Salmond, Noel A. |title=Hindu iconoclasts: Rammohun Roy, Dayananda Sarasvati and Nineteenth-Century Polemics Against Idolatry |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |chapter= Dayananda Saraswati |year=2004 |pages=114–115 |isbn=978-0-88920-419-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rigveda, in contemporary Hinduism, has been a reminder of the ancient cultural heritage and point of pride for Hindus, with some hymns still in use in major [[sanskara (rite of passage)|rites of passage]] ceremonies, but the literal acceptance of most of the textual essence is long gone.&lt;ref name=pinkney&gt;Andrea Pinkney (2014), Routledge Handbook of Religions in Asia (Editors: Bryan Turner and Oscar Salemink), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415635035}}, pages 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Haines (2008), Routledge Handbook of Religion and Politics, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415600293}}, page 80&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Renou]] wrote that the text is a distant object, and "even in the most orthodox domains, the reverence to the Vedas has come to be a simple raising of the hat".&lt;ref name=pinkney/&gt; Musicians and dance groups celebrate the text as a mark of Hindu heritage, through incorporating Rigvedic hymns in their compositions, such as in ''Hamsadhvani'' and ''Subhapantuvarali'' of [[Carnatic music]], and these have remained popular among the [[Hindu]]s for decades.&lt;ref name=pinkney/&gt; However, the contemporary Hindu beliefs are distant from the precepts in the ancient layer of Rigveda [[samhita]]s:
{{Quote|The social history and context of the Vedic texts are extremely distant from contemporary Hindu religious beliefs and practice, a reverence for the Vedas as an exemplar of Hindu heritage continues to inform a contemporary understanding of Hinduism. Popular reverence for Vedic scripture is similarly focused on the abiding authority and prestige of the Vedas rather than on any particular [[exegesis]] or engagement with the subject matter of the text.

== Monism debate==
While the older hymns of the Rigveda reflect  [[sacrifice|sacrifical]] ritual typical of [[polytheism]],&lt;ref name=fowler38&gt;see e.g. Jeaneane D Fowler (2002), Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism, Sussex University Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723936}}, pages 38-45&lt;/ref&gt; 
its younger parts, specifically mandalas 1 and 10, have been noted as containing [[monism|monistic]] or [[henotheism|henotheistic]] speculations.&lt;ref name=fowler38/&gt;
{{Quote box |width=26em | bgcolor=#FFE0BB |align=right |salign = right 
|quote=[[Nasadiya Sukta]] ([[Mandala 10|10]].129):

There was neither non-existence nor existence then;&lt;br /&gt;
Neither the realm of space, nor the sky which is beyond;&lt;br /&gt;
What stirred? Where? In whose protection?

There was neither death nor immortality then;&lt;br /&gt;
No distinguishing sign of night nor of day;&lt;br /&gt;
That One breathed, windless, by its own impulse;&lt;br /&gt;
Other than that there was nothing beyond.

Darkness there was at first, by darkness hidden;&lt;br /&gt;
Without distinctive marks, this all was water;&lt;br /&gt;
That which, becoming, by the void was covered;&lt;br /&gt;
That One by force of heat came into being;

Who really knows? Who will here proclaim it?&lt;br /&gt;
Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation?&lt;br/&gt;
Gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe.&lt;br/&gt;
Who then knows whence it has arisen?

Whether God's will created it, or whether He was mute;&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps it formed itself, or perhaps it did not;&lt;br /&gt;
Only He who is its overseer in highest heaven knows,&lt;br /&gt;
Only He knows, or perhaps He does not know.

A widely-cited example of such speculations is hymn 1.164.46:
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni, and he is heavenly nobly-winged Garutman.
To what is One, sages give many a title they call it Agni, Yama, Matarisvan.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Rigveda 1.164.46|Translated by Ralph Griffith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rig_Veda/Mandala_1/Hymn_164 |title=The Rig Veda/Mandala 1/Hymn 164 - Wikisource, the free online library |website=En.wikisource.org |date=2012-04-14 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=phillipshenoth/&gt;}}

[[Max Muller]] notably introduced the term "[[henotheism]]" for the philosophy expressed here, avoiding the connotations of "monotheism"  in Judeo-Christian tradition.&lt;ref name=phillipshenoth&gt;Stephen Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231144858}}, page 401&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garry Trompf (2005), In Search of Origins, 2nd Edition, Sterling, {{ISBN|978-1932705515}}, pages 60-61&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other widely-cited examples of   [[monism|monistic]] tendencies  include hymns  1.164, 8.36 and 10.31,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Paul Urumpackal (1972), Organized Religion According to Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Georgian University Press, {{ISBN|978-8876521553}}, pages 229-232 with footnote 133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Edgerton (1996), The Bhagavad Gita, Cambridge University Press, Reprinted by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120811492}}, pages 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars state that Rigveda includes an emerging diversity of thought, including monotheism, polytheism, henotheism and pantheism, the choice left to the preference of the worshipper.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Reed (2001), Hindu Literature: Or the Ancient Books of India, Simon Publishers, {{ISBN|978-1931541039}}, pages 16-19&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nasadiya Sukta]] (10.129), one of the most widely cited Rigvedic hymns in popular western presentations. 

Ruse (2015) commented on the old discussion of "monotheism" vs. "henotheism" vs. "monism" by noting an "[[atheism|atheistic]] streak" in hymns such as [[:wikisource:The_Rig_Veda/Mandala_10/Hymn_130|10.130]].&lt;ref name=michaelruse&gt;a "strong traditional streak that (by Western standards) would undoubtedly be thought atheistic"; hymn 10.130  can be read to be in "an atheistic spirit". Michael Ruse (2015), Atheism, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199334582}}, page 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples from [[Mandala 1]] adduced to illustrate the "metaphysical" nature of the contents of the younger hymns include:
1.164.34:  "What is the ultimate limit of the earth?", "What is the center of the universe?", "What is the semen of the cosmic horse?", "What is the ultimate source of human speech?";
1.164.34: "Who gave blood, soul, spirit to the earth?", "How could the unstructured universe give origin to this structured world?";
1.164.5:  "Where does the sun hide in the night?", "Where do gods live?";
1.164.6:  "What, where is the unborn support for the born universe?";
[[s:The Rig Veda/Mandala 1/Hymn 164|1.164]].20 (a hymn that is widely cited in the Upanishads as the parable of the Body and the Soul): "Two birds with fair wings, inseparable companions; Have found refuge in the same sheltering tree. One incessantly eats from the fig tree; the other, not eating, just looks on.".&lt;ref name=metaphysics/&gt;

==Translations==

The first published translation of any portion of the Rigveda in any European language was into Latin, by [[Friedrich August Rosen]] (''Rigvedae specimen'', London 1830). Predating [[Max Müller|Müller's]] ''editio princeps'' of the text by 19 years, Rosen was working from manuscripts brought back from India by [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|Colebrooke]]. [[H. H. Wilson]] was the first to make a complete translation of the Rig Veda into English, published in six volumes during the period 1850–88.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, H. H. ''{{IAST|Ṛig-Veda-Sanhitā}}: A Collection of Ancient Hindu Hymns''. 6 vols. (London, 1850–88); reprint: Cosmo Publications (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's version was based on the commentary of {{IAST|Sāyaṇa}}. Müller's Rig Veda Sanhita in 6 volumes Muller, Max, ed. (W. H. Allen and Co., London, 1849) has an English preface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.wbpublibnet.gov.in:8080/xmlui/handle/10689/6323?show=full |title=Rig - Veda - Sanhita - Vol.1 |website=Dspace.wbpublibnet.gov.in:8080 |date=2006-03-21 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The birch bark from which Müller produced his translation is held at The Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bori.ac.in/manuscript_department.html |title=The Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute : The Manuscript Department |website=Bori.ac.in |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
The Rigveda is the earliest, the most venerable, obscure, distant and difficult for moderns to understand – hence is often misinterpreted or worse: used as a peg on which to hang an idea or a theory.

Like all archaic texts, the Rigveda is difficult to translate into modern language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John J.

and early translations contained straightforward errors.&lt;ref name=fritsstaal/&gt; 
Another issue is the choice of translation for technical terms such as ''[[mandala]]'', conventionally translated "book", but more literally rendered "cycle".&lt;ref name=fritsstaal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AA MacDonnel (2000 print edition), India's Past: A Survey of Her Literatures, Religions, Languages and Antiquities, Asian Educational Services, {{ISBN|978-8120605701}}, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robinson Ellis, Vanity Fair, 1894-05-24.jpg|thumb|"Latin Literature". Caricature by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] published in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1894.]]
'''Robinson Ellis''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (5 September 1834 – 9 October 1913) was an [[England|English]] [[classical scholar]].

Ellis was born at [[Barming]], near [[Maidstone]], and was educated at [[Elizabeth College, Guernsey]], [[Rugby School]], and [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. He took a First in Classical Moderations in 1854 and a First in Literae Humaniores ('Greats') in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford University Calendar, 1895'', pp. 152, 292&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858 he became fellow of [[Trinity College, Oxford]], and in 1870 professor of [[Latin]] at [[University College, London]]. In 1876 he returned to Oxford, where from 1883 to 1893 he held the university readership in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Ellis, Robinson|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|pages=553–554|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA553}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 he succeeded [[Henry Nettleship]] as [[Corpus Professor of Latin]].&lt;ref name=whowaswho&gt;''Who Was Who, 1897-1916'', London : A. &amp; C. Black, 1920, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

His chief work was on [[Catullus]], whom he began to study in 1859. In the course of his research he used an important early manuscript of Catullus, named the ''Codex Oxoniensis'' (many sources credit him with a discovery here, but that exact codex is already mentioned in an edition of Catullus made by Friedrich Wilhelm Doering in 1822). However, Ellis did not recognise the importance of that codex, and failed to consult it for his ''Commentary on Catullus'' (1876), thereby attracting criticism ([[Emil Baehrens]] first recognised the importance of the Oxoniensis and published his conclusions two years earlier, in 1874). In 1889 Ellis produced a second, enlarged edition, which resulted its author's recognition as an authority on Catullus. Professor Ellis quoted largely from the early Italian commentators, maintaining that the land where the [[Renaissance]] originated had done more for scholarship than is commonly recognized. He supplemented his critical work by a translation (1871, dedicated to [[Alfred Tennyson]]), ''The Poems and Fragments of Catullus in the Metres of the Original''.&lt;ref name=whowaswho/&gt;

Another author to whom Professor Ellis devoted many years' study was [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], the [[astrology|astrological]] poet. In 1891 he published ''Noctes Manilianae'', a series of dissertations on the ''[[Astronomica (Manilius)|Astronomica]]'', with emendations. He also treated [[Avianus]], [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus|Velleius Paterculus]] and the [[Christian]] poet [[Orientius]], whose poem ''[[Commonitorium (Orientius)|Commonitorium]]'' he edited for the ''Vienna Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum''. He edited the ''Ibis'' of [[Ovid]], the ''Aetna'' of the [[Lucilius Junior|younger Lucilius]], and contributed to the ''Anecdota Oxoniensia'' various unedited [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] and other manuscripts. In 1907 he published ''[[Appendix Vergiliana]]'' (an edition of the minor poems); in 1908 ''The Annalist [[Granius Licinianus|Licinianus]]''.

'''Somerset House''' is a large [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] building situated on the south side of the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in [[central London]], overlooking the [[River Thames]], just east of [[Waterloo Bridge]]. The [[Georgian architecture|Georgian building]], which was built on the site of a [[Tudor period|Tudor]] [[palace]] belonging to the [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], was designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|Sir William Chambers]] in 1776. It was further extended with [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] wings to the east and west in 1831 and 1856 respectively.&lt;ref name="rough"&gt;Humphreys (2003), pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/documents/sht_audited_accounts_200910.pdf|title=Annual Report|date=2010|author=Somerset House Trust|publisher=Somerset House Trust|accessdate=27 February 2013|page=3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629080329/http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/documents/sht_audited_accounts_200910.pdf|archivedate=29 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The East Wing is now part of the adjacent Strand campus of [[King's College London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/Refurbishment%20Resource%20Efficiency%20Case%20Study_Education%20and%20Science_Somerset%20House.pdf|title=Restoration of a Grade I listed Building|publisher=WRAP|accessdate=27 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Somerset House stood directly on the [[River Thames]] until the [[Victoria Embankment]] was built in the late 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thornbury|first1=Walter|title=The Victoria Embankment|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/old-new-london/vol3/pp322-329|website=British History Online|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
===Old Somerset House===
====16th century====
In the sixteenth century, the [[Strand, London|Strand]], the north bank of the [[River Thames|Thames]] between the [[City of London]] and the [[Palace of Westminster]] was a favoured site for the mansions of bishops and aristocrats, who could commute from their own landing stages upriver to the court or downriver to the City and beyond.&lt;ref name=thurley9&gt;Thurley et al. (2009), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1539, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]], 1st [[Earl of Hertford]] (died 1552), obtained a grant of land at "Chester Place, outside [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]], London"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB |last=Pollard|first=Albert Frederick |wstitle=Seymour, Edward (1506?–1552) |volume=51 |p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; from his brother-in-law King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].&lt;ref name=thurley9/&gt; When his nephew the young [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]] came to the throne in 1547, Seymour became [[Duke of Somerset]] and [[Lord Protector]].&lt;ref name=thurley9/&gt; In about 1549 he pulled down an old [[Inn of Chancery]] and other houses which stood on the site and began to build himself a palatial residence, making liberal use of other nearby buildings including some of the [[chantry|chantry chapels]] and [[cloister]]s at [[Old St. Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]], which were demolished partly at his behest as part of the ongoing [[dissolution of the monasteries]]. It was a two-storey&lt;!-- British spelling --&gt; house built around a quadrangle with a gateway rising to three storeys and was one of the earliest examples of [[Renaissance architecture]] in England. It is not known who designed the building.&lt;ref name=thurley11&gt;Thurley et al (2009), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Before it was finished, however, the Duke of Somerset was overthrown, [[Attainder|attainted]] by [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and in 1552 was executed on [[Tower Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/tudor/who-decided-edward-seymour-duke-of-somerset-should-be-executed/ |title=Who decided Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, should be executed? |accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thurley11/&gt; Somerset Place, as the building was referred to, then came into the possession of the Crown. The duke's royal nephew's half-sister, the future [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], lived there during the reign of her half-sister [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] (1553–1558).&lt;ref name=thurley11/&gt; The process of completion and improvement was slow and costly. As late as 1598 [[John Stow]] refers to it as "yet unfinished".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/42959/42959-h/42959-h.htm|title=Survey of London|first=John|last=Stow|publisher=J M Dent And Sons|year=1598|isbn=978-1548852658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====17th century====
[[File:Somerset House by Kip 1722.JPG|thumb|right|305px|Old Somerset House, in a drawing by [[Jan Kip]] published in 1722, was a sprawling and irregular complex with wings from different periods in a mixture of styles. The buildings behind all four square gardens belong to Somerset House.]]
[[File:CanalettoSomersetHouseTerrace.jpg|thumb|right|305px|''The Thames from the Terrace of Somerset House Looking Towards St. Paul's'', {{circa|1750}} by [[Canaletto]]]]
In the 17th century, the house was used as a residence by queens consort. During the reign of [[James I of England|King James I]], the building became the London residence of his wife, [[Anne of Denmark]], and was renamed Denmark House.&lt;ref name=thurley13&gt;Thurley et al (2009), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; She commissioned a number of expensive additions and improvements, some to designs by [[Inigo Jones]].&lt;ref name=thurley16&gt;Thurley et al (2009), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, during the period between 1630 and 1635, he built a chapel where [[Henrietta Maria of France]], wife of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], could exercise her Roman Catholic religion.&lt;ref name=thurley16/&gt; This was in the care of the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin Order]] and was on a site to the southwest of the Great Court.&lt;ref name=thurley16/&gt; A small cemetery was attached and some of the tombstones are still to be seen built into one of the walls of a passage under the present quadrangle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://londonist.com/2010/03/the_secret_gravestones_beneath_some|title=The Secret Gravestones Beneath Somerset House|publisher=Londonist|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Royal occupation of Somerset House was interrupted by the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], and in 1649 [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] tried to sell it. They failed to find a buyer, although a sale of the contents realised the very considerable sum (for that time) of [[Pound sterling|£]]118,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Loot and Stolen Art: from Antiquity until the Present Day|first= Ivan |last=Lindsay|publisher=Unicorn Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1906509217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use was still found for it however. Part of it served as an army headquarters, with [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|General Fairfax]] (the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]]' commander-in-chief) being given official quarters there;&lt;ref name=thurley31&gt;Thurley et al (2009), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; lodgings were also provided for certain other Parliamentarian notables. It was in Somerset House that [[Lord Protector]] [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s body lay in state after his death in 1658.&lt;ref name=thurley25&gt;Thurley et al (2009), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, with the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], Queen Henrietta Maria returned and in 1661 began a considerable programme of rebuilding, the main feature of which was a magnificent new river front, again to the design of the late [[Inigo Jones]], who had died at Somerset House in 1652.&lt;ref name=thurley48&gt;Thurley et al (2009), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; However she returned to France in 1665 before it was finished. It was then used as an occasional residence by [[Catherine of Braganza]], wife of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]].&lt;ref name=thurley63&gt;Thurley et al (2009), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; During her time it received a certain notoriety as being, in the popular mind, a hot-bed of [[Catholic]] conspiracy. [[Titus Oates]] made full use of this prejudice in the fabricated details of the [[Popish Plot]] and it was alleged that [[Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey]], whose murder was one of the great mysteries of the age, had been killed in Somerset House before his body had been smuggled out and thrown into a ditch below [[Primrose Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle= Bedloe, William|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somerset House was refurbished by [[Sir Christopher Wren]] in 1685.&lt;ref name=thurley63/&gt; After the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688, Somerset House entered on a long period of decline, being used (after Queen Catherine left England in 1692) for [[grace and favour]] residences. In the conditions of the time this meant almost inevitably that little money could be found for its upkeep, and a slow process of decay crept in.&lt;ref name=thurley63/&gt; During the 18th century, however, the building ceased its royal associations. Though the view from its terraced riverfront garden, open to the public, was painted twice on his London visit by [[Canaletto]] (looking up- and downriver), it was used for storage, as a residence for visiting overseas dignitaries and as a [[barracks]] for troops. Suffering from neglect, Old Somerset House began to be demolished in 1775.&lt;ref name=thurley63/&gt;

===Somerset House (Sir William Chambers, 1776)===
[[File:Somerset House, London, United Kingdom (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|left|The south wing of Chambers' Somerset House]]
Since the middle of the 18th century there had been growing criticism that London had no great public buildings. Government departments and the learned societies were huddled away in small old buildings all over the city. Developing national pride found comparison with the capitals of continental Europe disquieting. [[Edmund Burke]] was the leading proponent of the scheme for a "national building", and in 1775 Parliament passed an act for the purpose of, ''inter alia'', "erecting and establishing {{as written|Publick}} Offices in Somerset House, and for embanking Parts of the River Thames lying within the bounds of the Manor of [[Savoy Hotel|Savoy]]". The list of public offices mentioned  in the act comprised "The Salt Office, The Stamp Office, The Tax Office, The Navy Office, The Navy Victualling Office, The Publick Lottery Office, The Hawkers and Pedlar&lt;!--perhaps Pedlars in original?--&gt; Office, The Hackney Coach Office, The Surveyor General of the Crown Lands Office, The [[Auditor of imprests|Auditors of the Imprest]] Office, The Pipe Office, The Office of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], The Office of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], The [[Board of Ordnance|Office of Ordnance]], The King's Bargemaster's House, The King's Bargehouses".&lt;ref&gt;Crown Lands Act 1775&lt;/ref&gt;

Somerset House was still technically a royal palace and therefore [[Crown property]]. By an earlier Act of Parliament, it had been placed in trust for the use of [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]] in the event that her husband [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] predeceased her. Therefore the 1775 act annulled this arrangement and instead provided for another property, Buckingham House, to be vested in trust for the Queen on the same terms. (Provision was made for the King, who had privately purchased Buckingham House some years earlier, to be duly compensated). In due course, the King outlived the Queen and the property (later known as [[Buckingham Palace]]) reverted 'to the use of His Majesty, his heirs and successors'.&lt;ref&gt;15 Geo.III c.33: An Act for settling Buckingham House, with the Appurtenances, upon the Queen, in case she should survive His Majesty, in lieu of His Majesty's Palace of ''Somerset House''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Construction====
[[File:Somerset House (9053039394).jpg|thumb|upright|Night view from beneath the Strand entrance]]
[[William Chambers (architect)|Sir William Chambers]], Surveyor-General of Works, was appointed at a salary of £2,000 per year to design and build the new Somerset House. He spent the last two decades of his life, beginning in 1775, in several phases of building at the present Somerset House. [[Thomas Telford]], then a stonemason, but later an eminent [[civil engineer]], was among those who worked on its construction. One of Chambers's most famous pupils, [[Thomas Hardwick]] Jnr&lt;!-- British spelling --&gt;, helped build parts of the building during his period of training and later wrote a short biography of Chambers.  By 1780 the North Wing, fronting the [[Strand, London|Strand]], was complete; its design was based on [[Inigo Jones]]'s drawings for the riverfront of the former building. Construction of the riverside wing followed; it was completed in 1786 and the East and West Wings were occupied from 1788.&lt;ref name="SH-history" /&gt;

It is not certain at what pace the rest of the construction progressed, but it is clear that the outbreak of [[French Revolutionary Wars|war with France]] in 1793 caused delays through lack of money. Chambers died in 1796, whereupon [[James Wyatt]] took over as architect. By 1801 the building was deemed to be complete,&lt;ref name="SH-history" /&gt; but there are indications that as late as 1819 some decorative work still needed to be completed. The building (which did not yet include the "New Wing" and [[King's College London|King's College]], situated behind the West and East Wings of the quadrangle respectively) cost £462,323.&lt;ref name="SH-history" /&gt;

At the time of construction, the Thames was not embanked and the river lapped the South Wing, where a great arch allowed boats and barges to penetrate to landing places within the building.&lt;ref name=thurley68&gt;Thurley et al (2009), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; The design influenced other great buildings: [[Charles Bulfinch]]'s [[Massachusetts State House]], begun in 1795, has been described as a work "frankly derivative" of Somerset House.&lt;ref&gt;Shand-Tucci, Douglass.

====A home for arts and learning====
[[File:The Exhibition Room at Somerset House by Thomas Rowlandson and Augustus Pugin. 1800..jpg|thumb|left|''The Exhibition Room at Somerset House'' by [[Thomas Rowlandson]] and [[Augustus Charles Pugin]] (1800). This room is now part of the [[Courtauld Gallery]].]]
The North Wing of Somerset House was initially fitted out to house the [[Royal Academy]], the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]. The Royal Academy took up residence first, in 1779, followed by the other two institutions the following year. The Royal Academy occupied the western half of the wing and the Royal Society the eastern half; their main entrances faced each other across the central vestibule leading from the Strand to the courtyard, topped by busts (of [[Michelangelo]] and [[Isaac Newton]] respectively) which are still in place today. The Society of Antiquaries was also accommodated in the eastern half of the wing, though its premises were limited to a first-floor meeting room, a ground-floor library, an apartment in the attic and a kitchen in the basement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Strand Block of Somerset House, 1780-1836: Part II|url=https://www.historytoday.com/sonia-lipman/strand-block-somerset-house-1780-1836-part-ii|website=History Today|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Geological Society]] was also accommodated in the Somerset House from 1828,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/history|website=The Geological Society|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as was the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] from 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A brief history of the RAS|url=https://www.ras.org.uk/about-the-ras/a-brief-history|website=Royal Astronomical Society|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition|Royal Academy Exhibition]] was held in Somerset House from 1780 onwards,&lt;ref name=thurley75&gt;Thurley et al (2009), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; until the Academy moved out in 1837 (initially to rooms in the new [[National Gallery]], then to [[Burlington House]], [[Piccadilly]]). Its former accommodation was given over to a newly-established Government School of Design (which was much later to become the [[Royal College of Art]]); it remained in the complex from 1837 until, in 1853, the [[Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths]] needed to expand its office space and the School relocated to [[Marlborough House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib4_1267714397|title=Government School of Design (London)|publisher=Mapping Sculpture|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857, the Royal Society moved out of Somerset House, followed in 1874 by the Society of Antiquaries, the [[Geological Society]] and the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]; they were all provided with new purpose-built accommodation in Burlington House.&lt;ref name="SH-history" /&gt;

====Use as a Government office====
A key reason for rebuilding Somerset House was to provide accommodation for a diverse variety of government offices.&lt;ref name=thurley63/&gt;

=====Navy Office=====
In 1789 the [[Navy Board]] moved into grand riverside rooms in the western half of the newly-completed South Wing. It was soon followed by its subsidiary Boards, the [[Victualling Commissioners]] and the [[Sick and Hurt Commissioners]], which (along with the Navy Pay Office) occupied the West Wing; they had all hitherto been based in the [[City of London]]. Thus the various Navy offices occupied around a third of Chambers' completed building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somerset House looking East|url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/142132.html|website=Royal Museums Greenwich|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 the Navy Board and its subsidiaries were abolished and their departments placed under the direct oversight of the [[Admiralty]]. Their administrative staff remained in Somerset House, but communications with the Admiralty (based a mile away in [[Whitehall]]) were problematic as what became known as the 'civil departments' of the Admiralty guarded their independence. In 1868, the Admiralty took the decision to move all their staff from Somerset House to Whitehall; this necessitated reconfiguring what had been a set of residences there pertaining to the [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty]] into office accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coad|first1=Jonathan|title=Support for the Fleet|date=2013|publisher=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the move was completed by 1873, and the expanding Inland Revenue immediately took over the vacated space in Somerset House.&lt;ref name="SH-history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/history|website=Somerset House|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Inland Revenue=====
[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 074 - Stamp Office, Somerset House.jpg|thumb|The Stamp Office, Somerset House: the basement stamping room.]]
From the beginning of the new Somerset House there was a fiscal presence in the shape of the [[Stamp Office]] and the [[Inland Revenue#History|Tax Office]], the former occupying the eastern part of the South Wing from 1789 and the latter occupying part of the East Wing. The Stamp Office had the task of applying an [[impressed duty stamp]] to various specific items to show that the [[Stamp duty in the United Kingdom|required duty]] had been paid. For example, up until 1855 (when the relevant duty was abolished) every newspaper produced in the country had to be brought to Somerset House to be stamped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mebden.altervista.org/images/londonJul12/09%20Somerset%20House%20stairs.jpg Information panel]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tax Office administered and collected various taxes, including [[Income tax in the United Kingdom|income tax]] (first levied in 1799). Introduced as a means of raising revenue in wartime, it was collected during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; though repealed in 1816, it was reintroduced in peacetime (in 1842) and has been collected ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1842/mar/21/the-income-tax|title=The Income Tax|date=21 March 1842|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inland Revenue]] was created by a merger of the Stamp and Taxes Office and the [[Excise]] Office in 1849; in 1854 the Excise Office staff were moved from their old headquarters in the City of London into the newly-built New Wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Graham|title=Something to Declare: 1000 years of Customs &amp; Excise|date=1980|publisher=Harrap &amp; Co.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somerset House continued in use by the Inland Revenue throughout the 20th century. In 2005, the [[Inland Revenue]] was merged with [[HM Customs and Excise]]; its successor [[HM Revenue &amp; Customs]] continued to occupy much of the building, although its executive and senior management moved to [[Government Offices Great George Street|100 Parliament Street]] shortly after the merger. Various divisions and directorates of HMRC continued to occupy the East Wing until 2009, the West Wing until 2011 and the New Wing until March 2013, by which time all staff had been relocated (with most moving across the street to the southwest wing of [[Bush House, London|Bush House]]). This brought to an end a 224-year association of the revenue services with Somerset House.&lt;ref name="SHT2014-15" /&gt;

=====Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths=====
In 1837, following the establishment of [[civil registration]] in the United Kingdom, the [[Registrar General of Births, Marriages and Deaths]] set up his office in the North Wing of Somerset House, establishing a connection that lasted for over 130 years. This office held all [[Birth certificate|birth]], [[Marriage certificate|marriage]] and [[Death certificate|death]] certificates in [[England and Wales]] until 1970, when the Registry and its associated archives were moved to nearby [[St Catherine's House]] at [[Aldwych]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vitalcertificates.co.uk/st-catherines-house.html#.W0ppLdJKgdU|title=St. Catherine's House|publisher=Vital Certificates|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Somerset House Laboratory=====
In 1842, the Excise Office had established a laboratory within its [[Old Broad Street|Broad Street]] headquarters for the prevention of the adulteration of [[tobacco]] products. It had started as basically a one-man operation by an employee of the Excise, George Phillips. After the Excise Office had been merged with the Office of Stamps and Taxes to form the Inland Revenue, the latter took over the laboratory; by 1858 it was reestablished in Somerset House as the Inland Revenue Laboratory (with Phillips remaining in charge). It was also known as the Somerset House Laboratory. Under the [[Inland Revenue]], the Laboratory's work expanded to encompass the testing of many different substances, including food, beer and spirits, as well as tobacco.&lt;ref name="Grace'sGuide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Laboratory of the Government Chemist|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Laboratory_of_the_Government_Chemist|website=Grace's Guide to British Industrial History|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips retired as principal chemist in 1874. James Bell was then the principal chemist of Somerset House Laboratory until his retirement in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=obit. Dr. James Bell, C.B., F.R.S.|journal=Nature|date = 9 April 1908|pages=539–540 | doi = 10.1038/077539a0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6owCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA539|volume=77|issue=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced as principal chemist by Sir [[Thomas Edward Thorpe]]. At the same time, the laboratory was amalgamated with a similar facility that had been established within HM Customs and it was renamed the [[Laboratory of the Government Chemist|Government Laboratory]]. In 1897, Thorpe moved the Government Laboratory from Somerset House to a new building of his own design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Thomas_Edward_Thorpe|title=Thomas Edward Thorpe|publisher=Grace's Guide|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Other departments=====
In addition to the learned societies, the ground floor rooms of the North wing housed the Hawkers and Pedlars Office (on the west side) and the [[Hackney Coach]] Office, the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)#Background|Lottery]] Office, the [[Privy Seal Office|Privy Seal and Signet Offices]] (on the east side).&lt;ref name="GentsMag1807"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Urban|first1=Sylvanus|title=Somerset House|journal=The Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Chronicle|date=1807|volume=77|page=545}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hackney Coach commissioners had been established on a permanent footing in 1694,&lt;ref name="LMAhackneycarriages"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vehicle registration and licensing records|url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/visitor-information/Documents/46-vehicle-registration-and-licensing-records.pdf|website=London Metropolitan Archives|publisher=Corporation of London|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Board of Commissioners of [[Hawker (trade)|Hawkers]], [[Pedlars]] and Petty [[Chapmen]] dated from 1698;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pedlars.info/history/84-1697-act.pdf Pedlars Act 1697]&lt;/ref&gt; the latter was abolished in 1810 and its work taken over by the Hackney Coach Office until its abolition in 1831, whereupon responsibility for licensing both of hackney carriages and of travelling traders passed to the Stamp Office. The Lottery Office, established in 1779, was also abolished in 1831 and its residual business likewise passed to the Stamp Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lottery Office records|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1027|website=National Archives|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Signet Office was abolished in 1851 and the Privy Seal Office in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records of the Keeper of the Privy Seal|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C237|website=National Archives|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first occupants of the building had been the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] Office. It was accommodated in the East Wing along with the Tax Office and various [[Exchequer]] offices (including the [[Clerk of the Pipe|Pipe Office]], the [[Remembrancer|Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer]]'s Office and the Office of the Clerk of the [[Estreat]]s). As early as 1795 the Exchequer was requesting that more space be made available; [[Sir John Soane]] was engaged to redesign their offices, and as part of the scheme the Duchy was relocated to another part of the East Wing, prompting complaints from its officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London: Somerset House, Lords Commissioners of the Treasury: designs for alterations to offices, 1795|url=http://collections.soane.org/drawings?ci_search_type=ARCI&amp;mi_search_type=adv&amp;sort=7&amp;tn=Drawings&amp;t=SCHEME1292|website=Sir John Soane's Museum Collection online|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pipe rolls]] and other ancient records of the Treasury and Exchequer (which had been moved to Somerset House from the [[Palace of Westminster]] in 1793) remained stored in the basements until the establishment of the [[Public Record Office]] in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=C.P.

The office of Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer ceased to exist in 1833 and the Pipe Office was abolished in 1834; however space in Somerset House continued to be at a premium: in 1854 an Act of Parliament was passed (the [[Duchy of Cornwall Office Act 1854]]) noting that the Duchy's rooms in Somerset House were now needed 'for the use of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, whose present office is insufficient for the Business thereof, and adjoins the said Office of the Duchy of Cornwall'. The Act provided for the Duchy Office to move to new, purpose-built premises in [[Pimlico]]: now known as 10 [[Buckingham Gate]], the building still serves as head office for the Duchy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.architecture.com/image-library/ribapix/image-information/poster/office-of-the-duchy-of-cornwall-buckingham-gate-pimlico-london/posterid/RIBA16978.html Architectural drawing]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)#History and establishment|Commissioners for Auditing Public Accounts]] were also housed in the East Wing, as was the Duchy of Lancaster Office (having moved there from accommodation in [[Gray's Inn]]) until it moved in 1823 to new offices across the road in [[Lancaster Place]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records of the Duchy of Lancaster|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C83|website=National Archives|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Surveyor General of the Land Revenues of the Crown|Surveyor of Crown Lands]] also had his office here until the early 19th century. The Salt Office initially occupied rooms in the West Wing, alongside the naval offices, but it was abolished in 1798 (administration of the [[salt tax]] having been transferred to the Board of Excise).&lt;ref name="GentsMag1807" /&gt;

During the 19th century Somerset House contained the offices of the [[Poor Law Commissioners]] (1834–1847)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records of the Poor Law Commission, Poor Law Board and Poor Law Department of the Local Government Board|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/poverty-poor-laws/#8-records-of-the-poor-law-commission-poor-law-board-and-poor-law-department-of-the-local-government-board|website=National Archives|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tithe Commutation Act 1836|Tithe Commissioners]] (1836–1851)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somerset House.

====19th century expansion====
[[File:Somerset House New Wing entrance.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Part of the New Wing (main entrance facing [[Lancaster Place]]).]]
Magnificent as the new building was, it was something short of what Chambers had intended, for he had planned for additional wings to the east and west of the [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]]. Cost had been the inhibiting factor. Eventually [[King's College London]] was erected to the east (the government granting the land on condition that the design conformed to Chambers' original design) by subscription between 1829 and 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2015/April/Westminster-City-Council-resolves-to-grant-planning-permission-for-Strand-campus-redevelopment.aspx|title=Westminster City Council resolves to grant planning permission for Strand redevelopment|date=23 April 2015|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, increasing demand for space led to another and last step. The western edge of the site was occupied by a row of houses used as dwellings for [[Admiralty]] officials who worked in the South Wing. Between 1851 and 1856 these were demolished and a further wing erected. 150 years later this part of the building is still known as the "''New'' Wing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/resident-opportunities/new-wing|title=New Wing|publisher=Somerset House|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 a headquarters building  was constructed in the West Court (between the West Wing and the New Wing) for the [[Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles|Civil Service Rifles]], a [[Volunteer Force|Rifle Volunteer Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somerset House: West Court - Civil Service Volunteers Building|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C4272984|website=National Archives|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====20th century modifications====
[[File:Civil Service Rifles Memorial, front (3, cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Civil Service Rifles War Memorial]]: installed in the main courtyard in 1919, relocated to the Terrace in 2002.]]
By the start of the [[World War I|First World War]] the Civil Service Rifles, by then renamed the 15th (Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles) Battalion, The [[London Regiment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wartimememoriesproject.com/greatwar/allied/alliedarmy-view.php?pid=719|title=15th (Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles) Battalion, The London Regiment|publisher=Wartime memories|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steppingforwardlondon.org/city-of-westminster.html|title=City of Westminster|publisher=Stepping Forward|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; had its own Morris tube firing range (where the calibre of the rifle is reduced for indoor operation by a use of a tube) fitted with vanishing and running targets at Somerset House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drillhalls.org/Anatomy.htm|title=Anatomy of a drill hall|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somerset House had its share of trials and tribulations during the  [[London blitz]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Apart from comparatively minor blast effects at various times, sixteen rooms and the handsome rotunda staircase (the Nelson Stair) were completely destroyed in the South Wing, and a further 27 damaged in the West Wing by a direct hit in October 1940.&lt;ref name=onping&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stephenongpin.com/PrintObjectPdf/index?objectID=790453|title=Plan for the Reconstruction of the South Wing of Somerset House, London|publisher=Stephen Onping Fine Art|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still more windows were shattered and balustrades toppled, but the worst was over by the end of May 1941. It was not until the 1950s that this damage to the South Wing was repaired. The work required skilled masons, whose services were hard to come by in the early post-war years. Sir [[Albert Richardson]] was appointed architect for the reconstruction. He skillfully recreated the Nelson Room and rebuilt the Nelson Stair. The work was completed in 1952 at a cost of (then) £84,000.&lt;ref name=onping/&gt;

In 1984 the Somerset House Act was passed, legislating the way for Somerset House to be redeveloped as a centre for the arts. In 1997 the Somerset House Trust was established as a charity to maintain the building and develop it as a centre for arts and culture.&lt;ref name="SHT2014-15"&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report and Accounts 2014-15|url=https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/file/1789/download?token=bWbp0ICr|website=Somerset House Trust|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century the building began to be reinvigorated as a centre for the visual arts. The first institution to move in (in 1989) was the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], including the [[Courtauld Gallery]], which has an important collection of [[old master]] and [[impressionist]] paintings. The Courtauld occupies the North Wing.&lt;ref name=thurley85&gt;Thurley et al (2009), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent history====
[[File:II Somerset House, London, UK.jpg|thumb|300px|The dancing fountains were installed in the 1990s.]]
The main courtyard, which had been used as a civil service car park, and the main terrace overlooking the Thames were refurbished and opened to the public; these alterations being overseen by the conservation architects Donald Insall &amp; Associates. Grants from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] financed the conversion of the South Wing between 1999 and 2003: a visitor centre featuring audio-visual displays on the history of the building, the gilded state barge of the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]] and a shop and café were opened, overlooking the river. The [[Gilbert Collection]] of decorative arts, and the [[Hermitage Rooms]], which stage exhibitions of items loaned from the [[Hermitage Museum]] in St Petersburg, moved into the same area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalinnovations.com/project_hrsc.html|title=Hermitage Rooms at Somerset House|publisher=Cultural Innovations|date=2009|accessdate=27 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620172403/http://www.culturalinnovations.com/project_hrsc.html|archivedate=20 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Hermitage exhibition took place in 2007 and the Gilbert Collection galleries closed in 2008; the collection moved into new galleries at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in June 2009. Somerset House now puts on a programme of art exhibitions drawing on various sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/popular-venues/somerset-house|title=Somerset House|publisher=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]|accessdate=27 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In stages from 2009 to 2013, HM Revenue and Customs withdrew from the other parts of the building; since March 2013 the Somerset House Trust has had oversight of the entire complex. Its management policy has been to rent out the upper floors at a commercial rate to 'creative businesses' whilst devoting the ground floor to 'public realm' activities. The trust receives no public subsidy and relies on income from rent and private hire to fund the upkeep of the estate and relies on ticket sales, merchandising and sponsorship to fund its artistic and cultural programme.&lt;ref name="SHT2014-15" /&gt;

Somerset House is now residence to over a hundred tenants, comprising a large and diverse collection of creative organisations and artists including the [[British Fashion Council]], 7Wonder, Hofesh Shechter Company and the [[Royal Society of Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/residents|title=Residents|date=2016-08-29|work=Somerset House|access-date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest tenant is [[King's College London]] whose Cultural Institute, Executive Centre and [[Dickson Poon School of Law]] occupy a large part of the East Wing. For a time the [[Representative of Anguilla, London|Representative of Anguilla]] (the [[diplomatic mission]] of the [[British Overseas Territory]] of [[Anguilla]]) was accommodated in part of the West Wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/263519/LDL_December_2013.pdf | title= The London Diplomatic List | date=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Sonderkommando'' photographs''' are four blurred photographs taken secretly in August 1944 inside the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in Nazi-occupied Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Didi-Huberman, ''Images in Spite of All: Four Photographs from Auschwitz'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008. First published as ''Images malgré tout'', Paris: Les Éditions de Minuit, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a few photographs in the [[Auschwitz Album]], they are the only ones known to exist of events around the [[gas chamber]]s.{{efn|Franziska Reiniger, [[Yad Vashem]]: "Among the millions of photographs that are related to Nazi death camps, only four depict the actual process of mass killing perpetrated at the gas chambers in Auschwitz-Birkenau."&lt;ref&gt;Franziska Reiniger, [http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/newsletter/29/photographs_sonderkommando.asp "Inside the Epicenter of the Horror—Photographs of the Sonderkommando"], [[Yad Vashem]], undated.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The images were taken within 15–30 minutes of each other by an inmate inside Auschwitz-Birkenau, the extermination camp within the Auschwitz complex. Usually named only as Alex, a Jewish prisoner from Greece, the photographer was a member of the ''[[Sonderkommando]]'', inmates forced to work in and around the gas chambers.{{efn|[[Georges Didi-Huberman]] (2008): "Hidden at the bottom of a bucket, the camera got into the hands of a Greek Jew called Alex, still unidentified today, for we do not know his family name. He was positioned on the lower level, in front of the incineration pits, where he was supposed to work with the other members of the squad."&lt;ref&gt;Didi-Huberman 2008, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Several sources identified him as [[Alberto Errera]], a Greek naval officer.&lt;ref name=ErreraID&gt;Gideon Greif, ''We Wept Without Tears: Testimonies of the Jewish Sonderkommando from Auschwitz'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005, 375, n.&amp;nbsp;2.{{pb}}

The [[Polish resistance in World War II|Polish resistance]] smuggled the film out of the camp in a toothpaste tube.&lt;ref name=DH2008p16/&gt;

The photographs were numbered 280–283 by the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]].&lt;ref name=Stone2001p143n3&gt;Dan Stone, "The Sonderkommando Photographs," ''Jewish Social Studies'', 7(3), Spring/Summer 2001, (132–148), 143, n.&amp;nbsp;3. {{jstor|4467613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nos. 280 and 281 show the cremation of corpses in a fire pit, shot through the black frame of the gas chamber's doorway or window. No. 282 shows a group of naked women just before they enter the gas chamber. No. 283 is an image of trees, the result of the photographer aiming too high.&lt;ref&gt;Didi-Huberman 2008, 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sonderkommando'' ("special commandos") in Auschwitz were mostly Jewish inmates, and at one point a few Russian prisoners-of-war, who were forced to work in the [[Cremation|crematoria]]. The crematoria contained the ''Entkleidungskammer'' (undressing rooms), gas chambers and furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;Franciszek Piper, "Gas Chambers and Crematoria," in Gutman and Berenbaum 1998 (157–178), 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1944 the camp had up to 1,000 ''Sonderkommando''&lt;ref&gt;Danuta Czech, "The Auschwitz Prisoner Administration," in Yisrael Gutman, Michael Berenbaum (eds.), ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', Indiana University Press, 1998, 372.&lt;/ref&gt; working in four crematoria (nos. II-V), and a bunker with extra gas chambers, housed in a thatched brick building known as the "little white house".&lt;ref&gt;Piper 1998, 161–168, 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

After inmates had been "selected" as unfit for work by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], the ''Sonderkommando'' usually took them to the undressing room, then walked them to the gas chamber, telling them they were being taken to the bathing and disinfection room.&lt;ref&gt;Greif 2005, 12–13, 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid panic, inmates were given a numbered hook for their belongings in the undressing room to make them believe they would be returning.&lt;ref&gt;Piper 1998, 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards the ''Sonderkommando'' moved the bodies out of the gas chamber, removed gold fillings, false teeth, hair, jewellery and spectacles, and disposed of the corpses, at first in mass graves, and later in furnaces and fire pits. Then they cleaned the gas chamber for the next arrivals.&lt;ref&gt;Graif 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IpGzGE6UK7wC&amp;pg=PA5 5–8], 15–16, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IpGzGE6UK7wC&amp;pg=PA321 321].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taking the photographs==
The photographer is usually named only as Alex, a Jewish inmate from Greece. Several sources have identified him as [[Alberto Errera]], a Greek naval officer who was shot and killed after striking an SS officer.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Stone, ''History, Memory and Mass Atrocity'', [[Vallentine Mitchell]], 2006, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Errera's details, Greif 2005, 375, n.&amp;nbsp;2.{{pb}}
Steven B. Bowman, ''The Agony of Greek Jews, 1940–1945'', [[Stanford University Press]], 2009, 95.{{pb}}
Shlomo Venezia, ''Inside the Gas Chambers: Eight Months in the Sonderkommando of Auschwitz'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013, 90ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Errera's code name was Alekos Alexandridis.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman 2009, 271.&lt;/ref&gt; Other members of the ''Sonderkommando'' in the camp's crematorium V—Alter Fajnzylberg (also known as Stanislaw Jankowski), brothers Shlomo and Josel Dragon, and David Szmulewski—helped obtain and hide the camera, and acted as look-outs.&lt;ref name=Stone2001p132&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4467613 Stone 2001], 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Fajnzylberg, who had worked at crematorium V since July 1943,&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Claude Pressac, ''Auschwitz: Technique and Operation of the Gas Chambers'', Beate Klarsfeld Foundation, 1989, 124.&lt;/ref&gt; described how the photographs came to be taken:

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;On the day on which the pictures were taken&amp;nbsp;... we allocated tasks. Some of us were to guard the person taking the pictures. In other words, we were to keep a careful watch for the approach of anyone who did not know the secret, and above all for any SS men moving about in the area. At last the moment came. We all gathered at the western entrance leading from the outside to the gas-chamber of Crematorium V: we could not see any SS men in the watchtower overlooking the door from the barbed wire, nor near the place where the pictures were to be taken. Alex, the Greek Jew, quickly took out his camera, pointed it towards a heap of burning bodies, and pressed the shutter. This is why the photograph shows prisoners from the ''Sonderkommando'' working at the heap. One of the SS was standing beside them, but his back was turned towards the crematorium building. Another picture was taken from the other side of the building, where women and men were undressing among the trees. They were from a transport that was to be murdered in the gas-chamber of Crematorium V.&lt;ref&gt;Janina Struk, ''Photographing the Holocaust: Interpretations of the Evidence'', I. B. Tauris, 2004, 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fajnzylberg recalled that the camera looked like a German [[Leica Camera|Leica]].&lt;ref name=Struk2004p115&gt;Struk 2004, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Szmulewski had hidden it in a bucket, and stayed on the roof of the crematorium as a look-out while Alex shot the film.&lt;ref name=DH2008p16&gt;Didi-Huberman 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CXuNvssxILIC&amp;pg=PA16 16].&lt;/ref&gt; Fajnzylberg stressed that, although Alex had pressed the shutter, all five men had been present and had acted together.&lt;ref name=Struk2004p115/&gt; According to Szmulewski, speaking in 1987 to [[Jean-Claude Pressac]], the four photographs were taken within 15–30 minutes of each other. The black frame of the gas chamber's doorway or window, probably doorway, is visible in photographs 280 and 281.&lt;ref name=Pressac1989p424&gt;Pressac 1989, 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was smuggled out of the camp by the Polish underground, hidden inside a tube of toothpaste by Helena Dantón, who worked in the SS canteen. A note dated 4 September 1944 and signed Stakło, written by political prisoners [[Józef Cyrankiewicz]] and [[Stanisław Kłodziński]], was attached to the film.&lt;ref name=DH2008p16/&gt; It asked that the photographs be sent to "Tell", Teresa Łasocka-Estreicher of the underground in Kraków:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4467613 Stone 2001], 148, n.&amp;nbsp;48.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;Urgent. Send two metal rolls of film for 6x9 as fast as possible. Have possibility of taking photos. Sending you photos of Birkenau showing prisoners sent to gas chambers. One photos shows one of the stakes at which bodies were burned when the crematoria could not manage to burn all the bodies. The bodies in the foreground are waiting to be thrown into the fire. Another picture shows one of the places in the forest where people undress before 'showering'—as they were told—and then go to the gas-chambers. Send film roll as fast as you can. Send the enclosed photos to Tell—we think enlargements of the photos can be sent further.&lt;ref&gt;Didi-Huberman 2008, 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Originals==
[[File:Alberto Errera - Sonderkommando photograph 283.jpg|thumb|No. 283: Trees near the gas chamber, taken shortly after No. 282. The photographer, shooting from the hip, aimed the camera too high.]]

When the photographs were first distributed by the [[Polish resistance in World War II|Polish resistance]], they were cropped to focus on the figures, with the black frames in the two fire-pit images removed. Photography historian Janina Struk writes that Teresa Łasocka-Estreicher ("Tell" in the note from the camp) asked Polish photographer {{Interlanguage link multi|Stanisław Mucha|pl|3=Stanisław Mucha (fotograf)}} to make prints, and it is assumed that it was Mucha who decided to crop them.&lt;ref name=Struk2004p118&gt;Struk 2004, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the cropped images were published in 1945, attributed to the ''Sonderkommando'' member David Szmulewski, in a report on Auschwitz-Birkenau by [[Jan Sehn]], a Polish judge.&lt;ref&gt;Pressac 1989, 422.&lt;/ref&gt; One was exhibited at Auschwitz in 1947, and others were published in 1958 in Warsaw in a book by Stanisław Wrzos-Glinka, Tadeusz Mazur and Jerzy Tomaszewski, ''1939–1945: Cierpienie i walka narodu polskiego'' (published in English as ''1939–1945: We Have Not Forgotten''). Some of the figures had been retouched to make them clearer.&lt;ref name=Struk2004p117/&gt;

Struk writes that, in 1960, Władyslaw Pytlik of the resistance movement in Brzeszcze offered testimony about his wartime experiences to the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]], and brought along three prints of the cropped photographs.&lt;ref name=Struk2004p117&gt;Struk 2004, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in 1985, after Pytlik died and his wife donated his photographs to the museum, including the uncropped versions, that the museum realized the prints they had seen before had been cropped.&lt;ref name=Struk2004p118/&gt;

Commentators have argued that the cropping offers a distorted view of events, giving the impression that the photographer was able to use his camera openly. In fact he and the rest of the group placed themselves in great danger by taking the shots; in two of them, 282 and 283, it is clear that he was not even able to look through the lens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/newsletter/29/photographs_sonderkommando.asp Reiniger (Yad Vashem)].&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian [[Georges Didi-Huberman]] argues that the cropping makes the photographs appear safe and erases the act of resistance and the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of the images, the process that "made them an event":

&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;"&gt;The ''mass of black'' that surrounds the sight of the cadavers and the pits, this mass where ''nothing is visible'' gives in reality a ''visual mark'' that is just as valuable as all the rest of the exposed surface. That mass where nothing is visible is the space of the gas chamber: the ''dark room'' into which one had to retreat, to step back, in order to give light to the work of the ''Sonderkommando'' outside, above the pyres. That mass of black gives us the situation itself, the space of possibility, the condition of existence of the photographs themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Didi-Huberman 2008, 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In popular culture==
The photographs were referenced in the 2015 [[Hungary|Hungarian]] movie ''[[Son of Saul]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/patrick-hicks/son-of-saul-auschwitz-and_b_9780314.html|title=Son of Saul, Auschwitz, and Yom HaShoah|first=Patrick|last=Hicks|date=4 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5268">'''''The Guardian'''s 100 best novels''' is a list of the best English-language novels as selected by [[Robert McCrum]] for ''[[The Guardian]]''.

==Reception==

Robert McCrum has received both praise and criticism for his 2015 list. Owing to this, he created a brief epilogue to the series, in which he explained many of his choices, such as his choice of [[Emma (novel)|Emma]] of the [[Jane Austen]] novels. He also explained regrettable exclusions, such as All That Is, [[Gravity's Rainbow]], [[Crash (J. G. Ballard novel)|Crash]], [[A Confederacy of Dunces]], [[Slaughterhouse Five]], [[All the Pretty Horses (novel)|All the Pretty Horses]], [[Wise Blood]], [[The Pursuit of Love]], [[Rebecca]] and [[Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy]]. He also commented on purposeful exclusions owing to his personal preference, such as books by [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Kingsley Amis]], [[John Fowles]], [[Walter Scott]] and [[Iris Murdoch]], the latter of which had caused a surge of controversy in the disclusion of [[The Black Prince]]. He aroused controversy again, however, in, at the end of this article, including a list of his opinion of the ten greatest novels of all:  [[Emma (novel)|Emma]], [[Wuthering Heights]], [[Moby-Dick]], [[Middlemarch]], [[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]], [[Heart of Darkness]], [[The Rainbow]], [[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]], [[Mrs Dalloway]], [[The Great Gatsby]].

One of the most frequent complaints was that, of the 100, only 21 were by women. One reviewer desired [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s [[Mary Barton]], [[Harriett Beecher Stowe]]'s [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]], [[Erica Jong]]'s [[Fear of Flying]], [[Margaret Atwood]]'s [[A Handmaid's Tale]], books by [[Eudora Welty]], [[Carson McCullers]], [[Willa Cather]] and [[Margaret Kennedy]]. She was also frustrated by the disclusion of [[Angela Carter]], saying, 'Carter’s influence cannot be overstated: her allegorical, taboo-breaking narratives have been genuinely influential.' She favoured taking out [[The Thirty-Nine Steps]], and replacing it with [[The Talented Mr. Ripley]], and taking out [[Joy in the Morning (Wodehouse novel)|Joy in the Morning]], preferring either [[Nancy Mitford]]'s [[The Pursuit of Love]], or [[E. M. Delafield]]'s Diary of a Provincial Lady. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/16/100-best-novels-women-in-literature-rachel-cooke 4.]

Another criticism was a lack of Irish authors. Many complained of there being only nine books-  [[Gulliver’s Travels]] by [[Jonathan Swift]] (1726), [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]] by [[Laurence Sterne]] (1759), [[The Picture of Dorian Gray]] by [[Oscar Wilde]] (1891); [[Dracula]] by [[Bram Stoker]] (1897), [[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]] by [[James Joyce]] (1922), [[Murphy]] by [[Samuel Beckett]] (1938), [[At Swim-Two-Birds]] by [[Flann O’Brien]] (1939), [[The Heat of the Day]] by [[Elizabeth Bowen]] (1948) and [[Amongst Women]] by [[John McGahern]] (1990). Claire Armistead compiled complaints of no works by these authors: [[Edna O'Brien]], [[William Trevor]], [[John Banville]], [[Colm Tóibín]], [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]], [[Maria Edgeworth]], [[J. G. Farrell]] and [[Sheridan le Fanu]]. The first mentioned exclusion caused perhaps the most controversy.

[[The Guardian]] asked readers a fortnight after the conclusion of McCrum's list to name the novels that they wish had been on the list. The book with the highest amount of votes was [[Chinua Achebe]]'s [[Things Fall Apart]], the second [[Arundhati Roy]]'s [[The God of Small Things]], and the third [[Toni Morrison]]'s [[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]. The fourth was [[Margaret Atwood]]'s [[The Handmaid's Tale]], fifth, [[Cormac McCarthy]]'s [[Blood Meridian]], then [[Rohinton Mistry]]'s [[A Fine Balance]], followed by [[David Foster Wallace]]'s [[Infinite Jest]], then [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s [[Slaughterhouse Five]], nine with [[J.R.R Tolkien]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings]], concluding the top ten with [[Glen Duncan]]'s [[I, Lucifer (Duncan novel)|I, Lucifer]], eleventh being [[J.K Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]], twelfth, [[Alasdair Gray]]'s [[Lanark: A Life in Four Books]], thirteenth, [[Stranger in a Strange Land]] by [[Robert A Heinlein]], penultimately [[Alice Walker]]'s [[The Colour Purple]], and finally, [[Woman on the Edge of Time]] by [[Marge Piercy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8289">The '''Malaysia Book of Records'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Malaysia Book of Records|url = http://www.malaysiarecords.com.my/|website = www.malaysiarecords.com.my|access-date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or '''MBR''') is a [[Malaysia]]n project to publish records set or broken by Malaysians. The project complements Prime Minister Tun Dr [[Mahathir Bin Mohamad]]'s '[[Malaysia Boleh!]]' (''Malaysia Can!'' in English) campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = Sunway College Students | title = Dato' Seri Dr. Mahathir: Father of Modernization | work = Malaysia Book of Records: A Brief Background | publisher = Sunway College | url = http://pmproject.doubleukay.com/mbr_about.html | accessdate = 2006-12-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070228014023/http://pmproject.doubleukay.com/mbr_about.html | archivedate = 2007-02-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the [[Guinness World Records]], there is an annually published book listing the records.

== Aims ==
The MBR is a project formed in line with the peoples [[Wawasan 2020|Vision 2020]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = Sunway College Students | title = Dato' Seri Dr. Mahathir: Father of Modernization | work = Malaysia Book of Records: A Brief Background | publisher = Sunway College | url = http://pmproject.doubleukay.com/mbr_about.html | accessdate = 2006-12-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070228014023/http://pmproject.doubleukay.com/mbr_about.html | archivedate = 2007-02-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realising that feats and record attempts were not recorded, Datuk [[Danny Ooi]], (founder of The Malaysia Book of Records) felt that recognition should be given to record achievements by Malaysians. As the National Record-Keeper, MBR is an official body that recognises record-holders, record-breakers, and record creators in the country. Upon confirmation of a record, the MBR will issue certificates to the record holder as a recognition for their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = Sunway College Students | title = Dato' Seri Dr. Mahathir: Father of Modernization | work = Malaysia Book of Records: A Brief Background | publisher = Sunway College | url = http://pmproject.doubleukay.com/mbr_about.html | accessdate = 2006-12-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070228014023/http://pmproject.doubleukay.com/mbr_about.html | archivedate = 2007-02-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and history ==
=== Beginnings ===
The idea was conceived in 1990 when Danny Ooi stumbled upon questions regarding extraordinary feats by Malaysians. He recalled seeing a man cycling for days at the [[Merdeka Stadium]], trying to set a world record, and another individual, who travelled from state to state by walking. The latter was hoping his attempt could be entered in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The MBR members |title=Malaysia Book of Records - About MBR |work=About Us: How It Started? |publisher=The Malaysia Book of Records |year=2001 |url=http://www.malaysiarecords.com.my/abtus.htm |accessdate=2006-12-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130173503/http://www.malaysiarecords.com.my/abtus.htm |archivedate=2006-11-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realising that none of these feats would be recorded, Mr. Ooi felt that recognition should be given to such determination exhibited by [[Malaysia]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The MBR members |title=Malaysia Book of Records - About MBR |work=About Us: How It Started? |publisher=The Malaysia Book of Records |year=2001 |url=http://www.malaysiarecords.com.my/abtus.htm |accessdate=2006-12-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130173503/http://www.malaysiarecords.com.my/abtus.htm |archivedate=2006-11-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Striving for excellence ===
Achievements were compiled for publication into the MBR and were also included in its production shown in a [[TV series]] called The Malaysia Book of Records' weekly TV series, which debuted on October 6, 1996 on [[TV2 (Malaysia)|RTM TV2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The MBR members |title=Malaysia Book of Records - About MBR |work=About Us: A Project that Instils the Spirit to "Strive for Excellence" |publisher=The Malaysia Book of Records |year=2001 |url=http://www.malaysiarecords.com.my/abtus.htm |accessdate=2006-12-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130173503/http://www.malaysiarecords.com.my/abtus.htm |archivedate=2006-11-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MBR will serve as a medium with which to acknowledge Malaysians who have promoted their country by creating records.

The first record book entitled "The Malaysia Book of Records' First Edition" was launched on December 9, 1998, unveiling the Malaysian records in one book for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The MBR members |title=Malaysia Book of Records - About MBR |work=About Us: A Project that Instils the Spirit to "Strive for Excellence" |publisher=The Malaysia Book of Records |year=2001 |url=http://www.malaysiarecords.com.my/abtus.htm |accessdate=2006-12-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130173503/http://www.malaysiarecords.com.my/abtus.htm |archivedate=2006-11-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Award ceremony ==
MBR Awards Night at National and State Level started in December 1998, when the Malaysia Book of Records organised a national level and two states' level, [[Sabah]] and [[Melaka]] respectively at MBR Awards Night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The MBR members |title=Malaysia Book of Records - About MBR |work=About Us: MBR Awards Night (at National and State Level) |publisher=The Malaysia Book of Records |year=2001 |url=http://www.malaysiarecords.com.my/abtus.htm |accessdate=2006-12-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130173503/http://www.malaysiarecords.com.my/abtus.htm |archivedate=2006-11-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11175">'''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial''' was a series of events and initiatives celebrating the 100th anniversary of the charter of the Museum occurring between 1969 and 1971.

==Background==
[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] celebrated its centennial with exhibitions, symposia, concerts, lectures, the reopening of refurbished galleries, special tours, social events, and other programming for eighteen months from October 1969 through the spring of 1971. The highlight was an open house and Centennial Ball on April 13, 1970. The anniversary was organized by The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 100th Anniversary Committee, chaired by Trustee [[Roswell Gilpatric]] and including Museum President Arthur A. Houghton, Trustees [[Brooke Astor]], [[C. Douglas Dillon]], and [[Arthur K. Watson]], advertising
executive [[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]], CBS President [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]], socialite and representative to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] [[Marietta Peabody Tree|Marietta Tree]], and collector and future Museum Trustee [[Jayne Wrightsman]]. Events were held both at the Museum and beyond, reaching cities throughout the United States and overseas.&lt;ref name=sipress&gt;Linda Sipress, The History of the Centennial of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Great Age of Fresco: [[Giotto]] to [[Pontormo]]," which was on view for only two months in the fall of 1968, was the first exhibition at the Museum to have [[corporate sponsorship]]. [[Olivetti]]’s underwriting of the exhibition was seen as a model for the pursuit of corporate sponsors for the Centennial exhibitions being planned at that time.&lt;ref name=gtfa&gt;[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Trescher_Centennial_records_b18234550.pdf Finding aid for the George Trescher records related to The Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial, 1949, 1960-1971 (bulk 1967-1970)]. [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 1 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Centennial special events at the Museum centered around five exhibitions celebrating the breadth of the Museum’s collecting over the previous one hundred years: “New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940-1970” (sponsored by [[Xerox]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16028coll12/id/2067/rec/36 Metropolitan Museum opens first major centennial exhibition "New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940-1970"]. Digital Collections, The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries. Retrieved 1 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;), "The Year 1200," "19th-Century America" (opened by [[First Lady]] [[Pat Nixon]]), “Before Cortés: Sculpture of Middle America,” and “Masterpieces of Seven Centuries.” "New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940-1970" was the Museum’s first exhibition of contemporary American art, curated by [[Henry Geldzahler]] to mark the inauguration of the newly established department of Contemporary Arts. It elicited reactions ranging from shock to relief at the new direction of collecting that it signaled.&lt;ref name=sipress /&gt; For each exhibition, a contemporary American composer was commissioned to create an orchestral fanfare. These included ''Shivaree'' by [[Leonard Bernstein]] (for "Before Cortes: Sculpture Of Middle America"), ''Ceremonial Fanfare For Brass Ensemble'' by [[Aaron Copland]] (for "Masterpieces Of Fifty Centuries"), ''Ceremonial Fanfare'' by [[Walter Piston]] (for "The Year 1200"),  ''Anniversary Fanfare'' by [[William Schuman]] (for "19th Century America"), and ''Metropolitan Museum Fanfare: Portrait Of An American Artist'' by [[Virgil Thomson]] (for "New York Painting And Sculpture: 1940-1970").&lt;ref name=gtfa /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/Various-Centennial-Fanfares-The-Metropolitan-Museum-Of-Art-1870-1970/release/3141343 Various – Centennial Fanfares: The Metropolitan Museum Of Art 1870-1970]. Discogs.&lt;/ref&gt;  

As part of the Museum’s expanded outreach programs, the Centennial was marked with loan exhibitions to museums in the United States and overseas, including Expo ’70 in [[Osaka, Japan]]. "Treasures from the Cloisters and the Metropolitan Museum of Art" traveled to the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. "Prints by Nine New York Painters" was seen in [[Jerusalem]] and seven other cities, while "Masterpieces of Painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art" traveled to The [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], which celebrated its own centennial in 1970. Many objects shown in "Before Cortés: Sculpture of Middle America" originated from [[Mexico]]'s [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|Instituto Nacional de Antropologia y Historia]] as part of a 25-year reciprocal loan and cultural program with the Metropolitan Museum.&lt;ref name=gtfa /&gt;

==Events==
April 13, 1970 marked the 100th anniversary of the granting of the Metropolitan Museum’s charter by the [[State of New York]]. On April 10 the Museum hosted a reception for staff members, before which Director [[Thomas Hoving]] presented the Museum’s “Comprehensive Plan for the Second Century,” which would guide building and program efforts in the coming decades. On April 13, the Museum held an open house for New York residents from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., including a receiving line of political dignitaries, special programs, refreshments, and entertainment in the Museum and on its Fifth Avenue plaza. The Centennial Ball that evening was hosted by Museum trustee [[Brooke Astor]] and featured reduced ticket prices for staff members and their families. Four ballrooms were set up in the Museum, each decorated by a noted New York interior decorator around the theme of a specific historical event or artistic period.&lt;ref name=sipress /&gt;

==Publications and centennial initiatives==
In celebration of the Centennial the Museum published eighteen new books, twelve directly related to the anniversary and six to other aspects of its collections. Among them were ''Merchants and Masterpieces: The Story of the Metropolitan Museum of Art'', written by [[The New Yorker|''New Yorker'']] staff writer [[Calvin Tomkins]] and published in 1970, which serves as an official history of the institution, and a centennial issue of the Metropolitan Museum Journal published to coincide with the celebrations’ conclusion in 1971. Other initiatives included educational programs, book publishing, television programs, film projects, and receptions to coincide with meetings of professional organizations including the [[American Association of Museums]].

“Cinémathèque at the Metropolitan Museum,” which was jointly sponsored by the Museum and [[City Center of Music and Drama]], showed seventy films dating from the medium’s first seventy-five years on thirty-five consecutive evenings from July 29 to September 3, 1970. The films were selected by [[Cinémathèque Française]] founder and director [[Henri Langlois]], from its archive of more than 50,000 films. Chosen for their significance and contributions to the history of [[filmmaking]], they included work from official film industries as well as current and early avant garde directors. The program was the most diverse film exhibition held in the United States to date, and was the Museum’s first major undertaking in film. Television projects associated with the centennial included "Masterpieces of Fifty Centuries” narrated by noted art historian Sir [[Kenneth Clark]], a one-hour [[NBC]] program prepared by [[Aline Saarinen]], and a network television report each evening during the week of October 6, 1969 on one of the five centerpiece centennial exhibitions.&lt;ref name=gtfa /&gt;

Specially tailored Museum visits were organized for members of other museums and cultural organizations across the [[United States]] to see the Centennial exhibits and participate in related programming. An intensive advertising, promotion, and [[public relations]] campaign publicized the events to a wide range of visitors and distant supporters through newspapers, magazines, and other print publications, as well as television and local store window displays. A free year-long course in art history, composed of thirty lectures, was developed and offered to the public by the Education Department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16028coll12/id/2059/rec/35 Metropolitan Museum gives free year-long art history course in celebration of Centennial]. Digital Collections, The Metropolitan Museum of Art Archives. Retrieved 1 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Artist [[Frank Stella]] was commissioned to create a Centennial logo, and medals incorporating the design were struck to mark the occasion. Remodeled and refurbished galleries in the Museum opened during this period, including the Ancient Near Eastern Art and Egyptian Art departments and the [[Anna Wintour Costume Center|Costume Institute]] in the fall of 1970, and a reinstallation of the Musical Instruments collections. The extent of air-conditioned gallery space was doubled, to include almost two-thirds of the Museum’s exhibition spaces. Considerable emphasis was also put on [[fundraising]] for the expenses associated with the Centennial celebrations.&lt;ref name=gtfa /&gt;

The '''Toy Shop''' is an exhibit building at [[Shelburne Museum]], which is located in [[Shelburne, Vermont]]. Toy Shop houses 19th- and early 20th-century playthings, including miniature transportation toys, penny banks, and music boxes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=30&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Shelburne Museum]] built the '''Toy Shop''' in the early 1950s as an extension to [[Variety Unit]]. Built in 1835, [[Variety Unit]], the only structure original to the Museum grounds, is an example of “continuous” architecture common to [[New England]] farmhouses. As more space was needed, farmers added new wings to their house. Farmers would merge farm and household buildings in one continuous structure that not only kept everything centralized but, also made it unnecessary to go outside in inclement weather. Built onto the rear of [[Variety Unit]], the '''Toy Shop''' extends this tradition.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections.

==Collection==
The impulse to play is universal, and throughout human history people not immediately preoccupied with survival have created playthings. [[Toys]] of earlier eras offer important clues to the lives of their makers and owners.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

[[Shelburne Museum]]’s collection of toys, which includes both [[Europe]]an and [[United States|American]] examples from the early nineteenth century through the first decades of the twentieth century, encompasses a broad range of both handmade and manufactured examples.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

Simple toys, both homemade and commercially produced, such as clay or glass [[marbles]] and cloth, wood, leather, or rubber balls, were widely available for purchase and would often reappear in new materials as manufacturing technology improved. Educational games, that began to appear in the late eighteenth century, document the skills and subjects that children were expected to master. The abundance of commercially produced American and European toys that appeared throughout the nineteenth century attests to technological advances and to changing perceptions of childhood and leisure.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

[[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial]] American toys included those of European manufacture as well as homemade examples. Cottage industries on both continents produced wooden blocks, [[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby]] and [[rocking horse]]s, [[puppet]]s, [[doll]]s, and other simple toys of paper, cloth, wood, and metal. After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Americans developed increasingly efficient ways to manufacture playthings and quickly emerged as leaders in the manufacture of cast-iron banks; miniature boats and wagons of tin, cast iron, or wood; and [[lithograph]]ed optical toys and board games.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

Although the United States dominated commercial toy manufacturing by 1900, individuals continued to make playthings by hand for a variety of reasons. Some toys, like [[whistle]]s made from spring willow twigs or dandelion stems, simply could not be commercially produced. While those who could not afford store-bought toys often created homemade toys, even the affluent sometimes chose to carve a miniature cradle or a [[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby horse]], or to stitch a doll dress or a puppet as a special gift. Children also enjoy making toys and the nineteenth century saw an emergence of pattern books and instructional magazines for their use.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

'''''Theatrum Orbis Terrarum''''' ({{IPA-la|tʰɛˈaːtrʊm ˈɔrbɪs tɛˈrːaːrʊm|lang}}, "Theatre of the World") is considered to be the first true modern [[atlas (cartography)|atlas]]. Written by [[Abraham Ortelius]], strongly encouraged by [[Gillis Hooftman]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mill.arts.kuleuven.be/decastro/en/n_29.htm Gillis Hooftman: Businessman and Patron (engl.)]&lt;/ref&gt; and originally printed on May 20, 1570, in [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]],&lt;ref name="WDL1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Map of the Gold-Producing Region of Peru. Florida. The Guastecan Region.|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/469/|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it consisted of a collection of uniform [[map]] sheets and sustaining text bound to form a book for which copper printing plates were specifically engraved. The Ortelius atlas is sometimes referred to as the summary of sixteenth-century [[cartography]]. The publication of the ''Theatrum Orbis Terrarum'' (1570) is often considered as the official beginning of the [[Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography]] (approximately 1570s–1670s).{{#tag:ref|Sometimes known as the [[Golden Age of Dutch cartography]].|group=note}}

==Content==
The atlas contained virtually no maps from the hand of Ortelius, but 53 bundled maps of other masters, with the source as indicated. Previously, only the pooling of disparate maps were released as custom on order. The Ortelius atlas, however, dropped the maps for this all in the same style and on the same size on copper plates, logically arranged by continent, region and State. He provided the maps in addition to a descriptive comment and referrals on the reverse. As such, this was the first time that the entirety of Western European knowledge of the world was brought together in one book.

In the bibliography, the section Catalogue Auctorum, not only were the 33 cartographers mentioned, whose work in the Theatrum was recorded (at that time not yet the habit), but also the total of 87 cartographers of the 16th century that Ortelius knew. This list grew in every Latin Edition, and included no less than 183 names in 1601. Among the sources are mentioned among other things the following: for the world map the ''World Map'' (1561) by [[Giacomo Gastaldi]], the ''porto Avenue of the Atlantic coast'' (1562) by [[Diego Gutiérrez (cartographer)|Diego Gutierrez]], the ''world map'' (1569) of [[Gerardus Mercator]], which have 8 maps derived from the Theatrum.

For the map of Europe, ''wall map'' (1554). of the Mercator ''map of Scandinavia'' (1539) by Olaus Magnus, map of Asia was derived from his own ''Asia-map'' from 1567, which in turn was inspired by that of Gastaldi (1559). Also for the Africa map he referred to Gastaldi.

This work by Ortelius, consisted of a collection of the best maps, refined by himself, combined into one map or split across multiple, and on the same size (folios of approximately 35 x 50&amp;nbsp;cm). The naming and location coordinates were not normalized.

==Editions==
After the initial publication of ''Theatrum Orbis Terrarum'', Ortelius regularly revised and expanded the atlas,&lt;ref name=WDL1/&gt; reissuing it in various formats until his death in 1598. From its original seventy maps and eighty-seven bibliographic references in the first edition (1570), the atlas grew through its thirty-one editions to encompass 183 references and 167 maps in 1612.

The legends of most maps name the author whose map Ortelius adapted. In the preface Ortelius credits [[Frans Hogenberg|Franciscus Hogenberg]] with engraving nearly all the maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Theatrum orbis terrarum | author = Ortelius, Abraham | publisher = Antuerpiae: Auctoris aere &amp; cura impressum, absolutumq́ue apud Aegid.

The 1573 ''Additamentum'' to the atlas is notable for containing [[Humphrey Llwyd]]'s ''[[Cambriae Typus]]'', the first map to show Wales on its own.&lt;ref name="Map of Wales"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/small/item/20019/ | title=Map of Wales, 'Cambriae Typus' by Humphrey Lhuyd, 1573 | work=Gathering the Jewels | author= | date= | accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the 1630s, the [[Willem Blaeu|Blaeu]] family issued their work under a similar title, ''[[Atlas Maior|Theatrum orbis terrarum, sive, Atlas Novus]]''.

== Structure ==
[[File:Bodleian Libraries, Ortelius, Theatrum Orbis Terrarum Titlepage with four figures which embody the four known continents.jpg|thumb|Title page from a 1606 edition with female figures representing the continents]]
All those editions had the same structure. They started with an allegorical title page, on which the five known continents, were presented by allegorical women, with Europe as the Queen. Then a command to [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], King of Spain and the low countries, and a poem by Adolphus Mekerchus (Adolf of Meetkercke). From 1579, the editions contain a portrait of Ortelius by Philip Galle, an introduction by Ortelius, in the Latin editions followed by a recommendation by [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]]. This is followed by the bibliography (''Auctorum Catalog''), an index (''Index Tabularum''), the cards with text on the back, starting from 1579 in the Latin editions followed by a register of place names in ancient times (''Nomenclator''), the treatise, the ''Mona Druidum insula'' of the Welsh scientist Humphrey Lhuyd (Humphrey Llwyd) over the Anglesey coat of arms, and finally the privilege and a colophon.

== Cost ==
The moneyed middle class, which had much interest in knowledge and science, turned out to be very much interested in the convenient size and the pooling of knowledge. For buyers who were not strong in Latin, published at the end of 1572, in addition to three Latin, there were a Dutch, German and French 2nd Edition. 
This rapid success prompted the '''Ortelius Theatrum''' constantly continued to expand and improve. In 1573, he released 17 more additional maps under the title ''Additamentum Theatri Orbis Terrarum'', which in these master works were published, bringing the total at 70 maps. By Ortelius' death in 1598, there were twenty-five editions that appeared in seven different languages.

'''Toy museums''' are [[museums]] for [[toy]]s. They typically showcase toys from a particular culture or period. These are distinct from [[children's museum]]s, which are museums for children, and are often interactive – toy museums may be aimed at children or adults, and may have interactive exhibits or be exclusively for display.

'''Tsentsak''' are invisible [[pathogen]]ic [[projectile]]s or magical [[Dart (missile)|darts]] utilized in [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] and [[mestizo]] [[shamanism|shamanic]] practices for the purposes of [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]] and [[healing]] throughout much the [[Amazon Basin]]. Anthropologists identify them as objects referenced in [[emic and etic|emic]] accounts that represent indigenous beliefs. ''Tsentak'' are not recognized in [[Medicine|scientific medicine]].
[[Image:Chaman amazonie 5 06.jpg|thumb|Shaman from an equatorial [[Amazonian forest]], June 2006]]

__TOC__

==Etymology==
The term ''tsentsak'' is derived from the [[Shuar language|Shuar]] language, which belongs to the [[Jivaroan language|Jivaroan language family]]. The [[Shuar people|Shuar]] are members of the [[Jivaroan peoples]] who reside in the [[Amazon rainforest]] of [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]]. This term is also used interchangeably with ''virote'' (primarily by mestizo shamans), a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term for [[crossbow]] bolt which was applied to the [[blowgun|blow darts]] made by the [[Jivaroan peoples|Jivaroans]] from the spines of the ''[[Bactris]]'' and ''[[Astrocaryum]]'' palms.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer 2009, pg. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use ==
''Tsentsak'' are stored by the shaman in his or her ''[[yachay]]'', or phlegm, located in the chest and stomach. The ''tsentsak'' are embedded within this phlegm and either the ''tsentsak'' or the ''[[yachay]]'' may be projected out of the shaman into a victim to cause illness and death. This phlegm is the materialization of the shaman's power; it is used to remove ''tsentsak'' from the bodies of victims as well as to protect the shaman from being harmed by the ''tsentsak'' of others.

''Tsentsak'' are only visible under the influence of a [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive substance]] called ''natemä'', which is the ''[[Jívaro]]'' word for ''[[ayahuasca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Harner 1973, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; When the shaman imbibes ''natemä'', the world of [[spirit]]s becomes visible. It is at this time that sorcerers and bewitching shamans can send ''tsentsak'' to their victims, while conversely, healers and curing shamans can remove ''tsentsak'' from their afflicted patients. 

''Tsentsak'' are believed to possess their own [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] and [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] as living [[spirit]]s that constantly desire to kill and consume human flesh.&lt;ref name="Beyer"&gt;Beyer 2009, pg. 85&lt;/ref&gt; A shaman must learn to control their darts lest they escape and cause unintended harm. To facilitate control of ''tsentsak'' they must be nourished by the consumption of ''mapacho'' ([[Nicotiana rustica]]), which can be smoked or imbibed as an [[infusion]].

A shaman who does not possess the necessary restraint to swallow their ''tsentsak'' when they rise to the back of their throat will become a sorcerer or bewitching shaman, while a shaman who can learn to control these urges will become a healer or curing shaman.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer 2009, pg. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] shaman who receives their first ''tsentsak'' from a predominantly bewitching shaman is likely to become a sorcerer, while the apprentice that receives their first ''tsentsak'' from a curing shaman will most likely become a healer.&lt;ref&gt;Harner 1973, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sorcery===
Throughout much of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]], ''tsentsak'' are believed to be the primary cause of [[illness]] and nonviolent death. These magical darts are utilized by ''[[Brujería|brujos]]'', (shamans specializing in attack sorcery) to bring suffering and death to their victims. The darts can be regurgitated at will by the sorcerer and projected from the mouth into the body of the victim. If the dart passes entirely though the victim they will die in three to seven days, however, if the dart becomes lodged in the victim's body, it may be removed by a curing shaman.

The shaman can collect [[plants]], [[insects]] and many other objects small enough to be swallowed, which he may then convert into ''tsentsak''. Each variety of ''tsentsak'' possesses its own specific attributes and degree of ability to cause [[illness]]. The amount and variety of ''tsentsak'' collected by a shaman is directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to his power and ability to kill and heal.

===Healing===
While sorcerers may use ''tsentsak'' for malevolent purposes, healing shamans use these magic darts to create a barrier of protection around their body. They also possess the ability to suck ''tsentsak'' from the body of a victim, which can then be sent back to the sorcerer from whom it originated. The healing shaman must imbibe ''[[ayahuasca]]'' to make the darts visible in the victim's body in order to remove them.

To remove the malevolent ''tsentsak'' the curing shaman must suck it out of the victim's body. In preparation for this act the shaman must first regurgitate two of his own ''tsentsak'' into the back of his throat. The first is used to block the shaman from accidentally ingesting the malevolent ''tsentsak'', which would most likely lead to his death. The second is used to absorb or dissolve the malevolent ''tsentsak'' which the shaman then spits out or sends back to the sorcerer.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer 2009, pg. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commodification==
A shaman will typically receive his first ''tsentsak'' from a practicing shaman to whom he has apprenticed. The practicing shaman will regurgitate some of his ''[[yachay]]'' containing the ''tsentsak'', which the apprentice must then swallow. The apprentice can then keep the darts in his stomach indefinitely. Many shamans will travel great distances to trade ''tsentsak'' with other powerful shamans from distant regions. They may also buy and sell ''tsentsak'' to increase the potency of their power.

To transfer ''tsentsak'' to another individual, both the buyer and seller must consume ''[[ayahuasca]]'' to make the ''tsentsak'' visible. The seller must then drink an infusion of ''[[Nicotiana rustica]]'' to regurgitate the ''tsentsak'', which is then displayed to the buyer. The buyer then swallows the ''tsentsak'', thereby adding it to his collection.&lt;ref name="Beyer" /&gt; ''Tsentsak'' may also be sold in the more tangible forms of tree thorns, insects, small stones, and even pieces of razor blade.&lt;ref name="Beyer" /&gt;

==Dietary and sexual restrictions==
In the context of [[Jivaroan peoples|Jivaroan]] [[shamanism]], an apprentice shaman must abstain from sexual intercourse and follow a special [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] for a period of at least three months after receiving their first ''tsentsak''. If these restrictions are broken, the darts will leave the body of the shaman and the process must be started from the beginning. To gain the power to kill and cure, a shaman must observe these restrictions for a period of five months.&lt;ref&gt;Harner 1973, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Mestizo shamans adhere to a similar restrictive diet in preparation for the consumption of [[ayahuasca]] before shamanic [[ritual]]s. These restrictions help to instill self-control and emotional mastery in preparation for a career as a healer. A shaman who breaks the restrictions cannot control the urges of their ''tsentsak'' and will become a sorcerer.

[[File:Vergennes schoolhouse.jpg|thumb|Vergennes Schoolhouse at the Shelburne Museum]]
'''The Schoolhouse''' is an exhibit building at [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]]. It was originally located in [[Vergennes, Vermont]].

==History==
The town of [[Vergennes, Vermont]] built the schoolhouse about 1840 on land leased from General Samuel Strong, an [[American Revolutionary War]] officer and descendant of one of [[Addison County]]’s first families. In the terms of the lease Strong stipulated that the town pay him an annual rent of one kernel of [[Indian corn]] and use the property for educational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The schoolhouse, although built at the height of [[Greek Revival]]’s popularity, reflects an amalgamation of architectural styling. Moderate [[Classical architecture|classical]] elements include the arched door, sash windows, and projecting bell tower, while the split-[[gable]] and octagonal shape of the bell tower’s [[cupola]] reflect 19th-century [[Eclecticism]] that developed as local builders and craftsmen freely combined elements from different architectural styles. On the exterior, the bricklayer ornamented the one-room structure with a simple patterning of six rows of stretchers (horizontally-laid bricks) and one row of headers (end-laid bricks) that formed subtle bands circling the building.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relocation==
When the [[Shelburne Museum]] relocated the Schoolhouse to its present site in 1947, the structure had been in disuse for many years. In preparation for the building’s restoration, the Museum created architectural drawings of the building’s exterior before removing the belfry and dismantling the brickwork piece-by-piece. The Museum replaced the original tinwork of the [[Bell tower|belfry]]’s dome with stronger [[copper]], repaired its acorn finial, replaced missing windows, resurfaced the plastered interior walls, and re-hung the bell. The inclusion of desks, benches, and maps reflect the modest furnishings of a 19th-century rural school.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==One-Room Schoolhouse==
One-room schools were commonplace throughout rural portions of the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In most rural (country) and small town schools, all of the students met in a single room. There, a single teacher taught academic basics to five to eight grade levels of elementary-age boys and girls. ''For more information see'' [[One-room school]]

==School in the 19th century==
The early school room was about 20 feet square with a huge fireplace in the front. Later heat was supplied by an iron wood stove. Two privies were out back, one for the boys and one for the girls. Drinking water was ladled out of a wooden pail. The buildings were dark and often dirty, with no insulation to keep out the winter cold. There were no playgrounds and often no shade. There were few text books. Children used slates and a Bible as school supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. "The Addison Country Spelling Bee" School Program. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seats were often arranged with the smallest in the front and the tallest in the back so the teacher could see each head.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. "The Addison Country Spelling Bee" School Program. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools were only open a few months a year and consisted of winter and summer sessions (usually December–March and then mid-May to August).  The older boys were usually working in the fields during the summer, so they only attended in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. "The Addison Country Spelling Bee" School Program. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Men predominated as teachers until the early 19th century, but by the mid-19th century most teachers were women. Women could be teachers only if they were unmarried; as soon as they married, another teacher was hired.  Women were paid half the salaries as men.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. "The Addison Country Spelling Bee" School Program. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Students ranged in age from 4 or 5 to 21 and sometimes toddlers went to school with older siblings who were caregivers. In 1870 in Vermont the average cost to educate one student was $13.60 per year.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. "The Addison Country Spelling Bee" School Program. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grading did not exist. Curriculum consisted of the fundamentals of reading, spelling, writing, and calculating. Students recited the alphabet, the definitions of spelling words, the rules of grammar, arithmetic facts, and long prose passages. Few students went beyond the fundamentals taught in the one-room schoolhouse. Teachers were themselves often 14 or 15 years old with no advanced training.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. "The Addison Country Spelling Bee" School Program. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Correct conduct was considered the most important part of a student’s education. Boys entered the school room, took off their hats, and bowed to the teacher and others. On leaving school they would bow again. Girls would enter, bow or curtsey, and repeat on leaving.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. "The Addison Country Spelling Bee" School Program. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wine-Searcher''' is a [[web search engine]] enabling users to locate the price and availability of a given wine, spirit or beer globally, and be directed to a retail outlet selling the alcoholic beverage. As of April 2018, Wine-Searcher had 8.6 million wine listings from 90,952 outlets globally. The site also includes an encyclopedia of wine regions, grape varieties and wine producers. 

== History ==
The company was founded in 1998 by Martin Brown, a former [[e-commerce]] manager for London wine merchant [[Berry Brothers &amp; Rudd|Berry Bros &amp; Rudd]]. In 2006, the operation was shifted from London to Auckland, in Brown's native [[New Zealand]]. The company now has a staff of roughly 65 employees including [[Developer (software)|software developers]], database administrators, account managers, wine experts and writers.

== Products and services ==
Wine-Searcher collects online wine lists from a range of wine retailers, producers and auction houses. A team of wine experts vets the listings, which are uploaded to a database. Merchants can choose to boost their own listings by paying a yearly fee to "sponsor" Wine-Searcher. These listings are available to all users, but for a small fee, an upgrade to Pro Version will return all results.

Apart from its core function as a database, Wine-Searcher also an encyclopedia which covers the most important grape varieties and wine regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/regions.lml |title=Wine Regions &amp; Appellations |accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides daily wine news . Wine-Searcher has mobile apps for iOS and Android.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/app.lml |title=Wine-Searcher Mobile App |accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wine-Searcher's income derives from charging subscribers for "pro version" access, charging retailers to share their listings, data and advertisements on the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wine-pages.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=041462l |title=Wine Searcher |accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reviews ==
Over the years, Wine-Searcher's contribution to [[online]] wine business has been recognized by numerous sources.
