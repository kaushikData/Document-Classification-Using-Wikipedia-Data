[[File:2013 12 11 Mensenrechtentulp Aahung Sheena Hadi 0687 (12220330944).jpg|thumb|right|Sheena Hadi, director of Aahung, at presentation of [[Human Rights Tulip]], 2013]]

'''Aahung''' is a [[Pakistan]]i organisation which aims to improve [[Reproductive health|sexual and reproductive health]]. It is based in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. It was established in 1994, and in 2013 was awarded the annual [[Human Rights Tulip]] prize by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government.

==Aims==
Aahung is a Karachi-based [[non-governmental organisation]] which aims to improve the sexual and reproductive health of men, women, and adolescents across Pakistan. On its website it states its role as “enhancing the scope and improving the quality of services that uphold sexual health and rights, while advocating for an enabling environment where every individual’s sexual health and rights are respected, protected, and fulfilled as an inalienable human right.”&lt;ref name=own&gt;[http://aahung.org/index.php/about-us ''About Us''], Aahung website, retrieved 11 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Aahung was founded in 1994, bringing together two community-based projects, Karachi Reproductive Health Project (KRHP-1994) and AIDS Awareness Program (AAP-1997), which were aiming to improve the sexual health status of women and adolescents in four low-income urban communities.&lt;ref name=ilmk /&gt;

The experience and research of project members pointed to a widespread lack of accurate knowledge and understanding about sexual health matters, not only among the general population but among providers of medical services as well. Aahung developed culturally appropriate techniques for providing information and empowering members of the public to make better sexual and reproductive health choices and practise safer behaviours. It improved the skills of medical practitioners in handling consultations about sexual health problems, and drew up more appropriate protocols for managing [[sexually transmitted disease]].&lt;ref name=ilmk&gt;[http://www.ilmkidunya.com/educational_organizations/educational_ngos_pakistan_aahung.aspx ''Aahung''], ilmkidunya.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheena Hadi, a graduate of [[Amherst College]], Massachusetts, became director of Aahung in 2008.&lt;ref name=innovj&gt;[http://www.innovatingjustice.com/network/?memberID=32770 ''Sheena Hadi, Director Aahung''], Innovating Justice Forum&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The group's own summing up of its activities is: “Functioning in an environment devoid of expertise or resources, Aahung has been successful in developing culturally relevant strategies to respond to the sexual and reproductive health needs of the Pakistani population. Moreover, Aahung has had success in integrating quality sexual and reproductive health education in medical academic and educational institutions across Pakistan.”&lt;ref name=own /&gt; 

Aahung adopts innovative strategies to promote public awareness on critical topics of reproductive health such as gender equality, violence, maternal health, and infection prevention, and to advance reproductive health and rights. It also develops long-term partnerships with organisations and institutions providing education and medical services.&lt;ref name=thenews&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-27235-Pakistan-wins-prestigious-international-HR-award  ''Pakistan wins prestigious international HR award''], [[The News International]] (Pakistan), 12 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public awareness===
In a country such as Pakistan, where religious and cultural norms may hinder communication on sexual and reproductive health issues, Aahung has developed culturally appropriate strategies to respond to the sexual health needs of the Pakistani population.&lt;ref name=hiil&gt;[http://www.hiil.org/insight/protecting-sexual-health-and-reproductive-rights-in-pakistan ''Protecting sexual health and reproductive rights in Pakistan''], HiiL, 31 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It offers specialised training courses and develops information, education and communication materials in provincial languages that can be disseminated through clinics and community workers throughout Pakistan.&lt;ref name=own /&gt; It widens community [[outreach]] by working with the field staff of community-based organisations (CBOs) and building the capacity of these CBOs.&lt;ref name=hiil /&gt;

===Children and young people===
Aahung has begun to introduce sexual health education and services into schools,&lt;ref name=ilmk /&gt; a provision that has otherwise been generally lacking in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=washpost&gt;Michele Langevine Leiby, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-a-first-pakistani-medical-school-will-offer-sex-ed/2012/10/08/03340508-0fe6-11e2-bb5e-492c0d30bff6_story.html ''In a first, Pakistani medical school will offer sex-ed''], [[Washington Post]], 8 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=policy&gt;Karen Hardee, Pamela Pine, Lauren Taggart Wasson, [http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACX530.pdf ''Adolescent and Youth Reproductive Health in the Asia and Near East Region Status, Issues, Policies, and Programs''], Occasional papers: 9, p. 30, [[USAID]] POLICY project, January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It has drawn up [[life skills-based education]] (LSBE) programmes incorporating sexual and reproductive health, and trained teachers to implement them at both primary&lt;ref name=thenews /&gt; and secondary&lt;ref name=policy /&gt; levels. Topics covered include [[Sexism|gender discrimination]], [[HIV/AIDS]], [[child marriage]] and protection from violence. In the process Aahung has worked with religious leaders and institutions. Aahung has succeeded in integrating the LSBE curriculum into public and private schools in [[Sindh]] province.&lt;ref name=dfid&gt;Khadijah Fancy &amp; Erika McAslan, [http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Education-guidance-note-partB.pdf ''Addressing Violence against Women and Girls in Education Programming''], Guidance Note: Part B: Practical Guidance, p. 26, [[DFID]], May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical education===
Aahung has integrated sexual health education and services into a range of reproductive health organisations, medical universities and nursing colleges.&lt;ref name=ilmk /&gt;&lt;ref name=thenews /&gt; For example, Aahung has collaborated with [[Dow University]] of Karachi on developing a medical education curriculum for trainee medical doctors, incorporating reproductive health education, and inculcating clinical skills in dealing with patients' sexual and reproductive issues in a sensitive and non-judgemental way.&lt;ref name=washpost /&gt;

===Advocacy===
Aahung has adopted a rights-based approach to address the sexual and reproductive health needs of the people of Pakistan, advocating for increased access to quality sexual and reproductive health information and services. It advocates for improving laws and policies and holding the government accountable to national and international commitments in this arena.&lt;ref name=hiil /&gt;

===Publications===
Publications of Aahung include: “Preventing Child Sexual Abuse”, “Aware for Life - Facilitator Guide”, “A Care givers' Guide: 'How to Talk to Children and Young People'”, and “Teaching Puberty and Responsible Behaviour”.&lt;ref name=pildat&gt;[http://www.pildat.org/CSODirectory/csodetails.asp?detid=2 ''Aahung''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052656/http://www.pildat.org/CSODirectory/csodetails.asp?detid=2 |date=March 4, 2016 }}, PILDAT (Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency) Online Directory of Parliamentary Committees, Civil Society and Research Organisations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human Rights Tulip, 2013==

In December 2013, Aahung, in the person of its director Sheena Hadi, was presented with the [[Human Rights Tulip]] Award by the Netherlands Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Frans Timmermans]]. The Tulip award is presented each year to a global human rights defender or organisation for the promotion and protection of human rights through the use of innovation. In selecting the 2013 winner, special attention was given to human rights defenders working in innovative ways.&lt;ref name=nlgovt&gt;[http://www.government.nl/news/2013/12/12/human-rights-tulip-awarded-to-pakistani-organisation-aahung.html ''Human Rights Tulip awarded to Pakistani organisation Aahung''], Government of the Netherlands, News item, 12 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thenews /&gt;

Presenting the award on 11 December 2013, Mr Timmermans said: “Aahung owes its success to the ability to give human rights a human face … Its efforts to promote human rights are not abstract. They involve the people we share our daily lives with and who are part of the local community. They teach men and women of all ages life skills to help them deal with issues like puberty, gender discrimination, HIV/AIDS, peer pressure and family planning. The Aahung method is to engage a wide range of stakeholders, like school teachers, medical staff, religious scholars and parents, to talk about difficult subjects”.&lt;ref name=nlgovt /&gt;

Timmermans added that the award of the Human Rights Tulip to Aahung was more than simply the end of a selection process: it was the start of a long relationship between Aahung and the Netherlands. Aahung would be able to use the €100,000 prize to further develop, innovate and scale up its human rights work, so that more people in as many places as possible would be able to benefit. The Hague Institute for the Internationalisation of Law (HiiL) would work with Aahung to extend the reach of the latter’s successful approach.&lt;ref name=nlgovt /&gt;

== Treatment and management==
If the tumor is well-defined, the treatment is often includes a [[hysterectomy]] and radiation treatment. Treatment may vary according to how far the tumor has spread.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis is dependent upon the presence and abundance of glandular cells.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Outcomes improve if the tumor is well-defined.

==Epidemiology==
It is associated with [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] (estrogen). The risk is higher in white women than other ethnicities, incidence, prevalence, age distribution, and sex ratio

'''Agriculture''' is the cultivation of land and breeding of [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s to provide [[food]], [[fiber]], [[medicinal plants]] and other products to sustain and enhance life.&lt;ref name="Office1999"&gt;{{cite book |title=Safety and health in agriculture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtBa6XIW_aQC&amp;pg=PA77 |year=1999 |publisher=International Labour Organization |isbn=978-92-2-111517-5 |page=77 |accessdate=13 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722061757/http://books.google.com/books?id=GtBa6XIW_aQC&amp;pg=PA77 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all |quote=defined agriculture as 'all forms of activities connected with growing, harvesting and primary processing of all types of crops, with the breeding, raising and caring for animals, and with tending gardens and nurseries'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture was the key development in the rise of [[sedentism|sedentary]] [[human civilization]], whereby farming of [[domestication|domesticated]] species created food [[economic surplus|surpluses]] that enabled people to live in cities. The study of agriculture is known as [[agricultural science]]. The [[history of agriculture]] dates back thousands of years; people gathered wild grains at least 105,000 years ago and began to plant them around 11,500 years ago before they became domesticated. Pigs, sheep, and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Crops originate from at least 11 regions of the world. [[Industrial agriculture]] based on large-scale [[monoculture]] has in the past century come to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion people worldwide still depend on [[subsistence agriculture]].

Modern [[agronomy]], [[plant breeding]], [[agrochemical]]s such as [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s, and technological developments have sharply increased yields from cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological and environmental  damage. [[Selective breeding]] and modern practices in [[animal husbandry]] have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about [[animal welfare]] and environmental damage through contributions to [[global warming]], depletion of [[aquifer]]s, [[deforestation]], [[antibiotic resistance]], and [[growth hormone]]s in [[industrial meat production|industrially produced meat]]. [[Genetically modified organism]]s are widely used, although they are banned in several countries.

The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, [[fuel]]s, and [[raw material]]s (such as [[natural rubber|rubber]]). Classes of foods include [[cereal]]s (grains), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[cooking oil|oils]], [[meat]], [[milk]], [[edible mushroom|fungi]] and [[eggs as food|eggs]]. Over one-third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the service sector, although the number of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the past several centuries.

==Etymology and scope==

The word ''agriculture'' is a late [[Middle English]] adaptation of Latin ''agricultūra'', from ''ager'', "field", which in its turn came from [[Greek language|Greek]] αγρός, and ''cultūra'', "[[Tillage|cultivation]]" or "growing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=14 |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Word Histories |editor=Chantrell, Glynnis |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-19-863121-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture usually refers to human activities, although it is also observed in certain species of [[ant]], [[termite]] and [[ambrosia beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Agriculture in Insects |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=36 |pages=563–595 |date=December 2005 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626 |author1=Mueller, Ulrich G. |author2=Gerardo, Nicole M. |author3=Aanen, Duur K. |author4=Six, Diana L. |author5=Schultz, Ted R. |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture is defined with varying scopes, in its broadest sense using natural resources to "produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services".&lt;ref name=Maine /&gt; Thus defined, it includes [[arable farming]], [[horticulture]], [[animal husbandry]], and [[forestry]], but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded.&lt;ref name=Maine&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maine.gov/education/aged/definition.html |title=Definition of Agriculture |publisher=State of Maine |accessdate=6 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323075557/http://www.maine.gov/education/aged/definition.html |archivedate=23 March 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]].&lt;ref name=Bocquet-Appel&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bocquet-Appel, Jean-Pierre |title=When the World's Population Took Off: The Springboard of the Neolithic Demographic Transition |journal=Science |date=29 July 2011 |volume=333 |issue=6042 |pages=560–561 |doi=10.1126/science.1208880 |pmid=21798934 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6042/560.full|bibcode=2011Sci...333..560B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent [[centers of origin]].&lt;ref name="Larson2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1323964111 |title=Current perspectives and the future of domestication studies |journal=PNAS |volume=111 |issue=17 |pages=6139–6146 |year=2014 |last1=Larson |first1=G. |last2=Piperno |first2=D.

Scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from [[hunter-gatherer]] to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing [[sedentism]]; examples are the [[Natufian culture]] in the [[Levant]], and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China.

[[File:Reindeer herding.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reindeer]] herds form the basis of pastoral agriculture for several Arctic and Subarctic peoples.]]

[[Pastoralism]] involves managing domesticated animals. In [[nomadic pastoralism]], herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture, fodder, and water. This type of farming is practised in arid and semi-arid regions of Sahara, Central Asia and some parts of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Blench | first=Roger | title=Pastoralists in the new millennium | publisher=FAO | date=2001 | pages=11–12 | url=http://www.odi.org.uk/work/projects/pdn/eps.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201000745/http://www.odi.org.uk/work/projects/pdn/eps.pdf | archivedate=1 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[shifting cultivation]], a small area of a forest is cleared by cutting down all the trees and the area is burned. The land is then used for growing crops for several years. When the soil becomes less fertile, the area is then abandoned. Another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated. This type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly. This practice is used in Northeast India, Southeast Asia, and the Amazon Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shifting cultivation |url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/swidden |publisher=[[Survival International]] |accessdate=28 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829015112/http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/swidden |archivedate=29 August 2016| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manuring a vegetable garden.jpg|thumb|Spreading manure by hand in Zambia]]

[[Subsistence farming]] is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone, with little left over for transport elsewhere. It is intensively practiced in Monsoon Asia and South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Waters, Tony |title=The Persistence of Subsistence Agriculture: life beneath the level of the marketplace |publisher=Lexington Books |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the typical subsistence [[farmer]] is equivalent to a smallholder, then there are an estimated 2.5 billion such farmers in 2018, cultivating about 60% of the earth's [[arable land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=&lt;!--no byline--&gt; |date=7 March 2018 |title=Chinese project offers a brighter farming future |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02742-3 |department=Editorial |journal=Nature |volume=555 |issue=7695 |page=141 |doi=10.1038/d41586-018-02742-3 |pmid=29517037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[intensive farming]], the crops are cultivated to maximise profit, with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs. This type of farming is practiced mainly in highly developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9042533 Encyclopædia Britannica's definition of Intensive Agriculture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705221311/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9042533 |date=5 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcFactSheet"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/biology/livingthingsenvironment/4foodandsustainabilityrev5.shtml BBC School fact sheet on intensive farming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503035007/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/biology/livingthingsenvironment/4foodandsustainabilityrev5.shtml |date=3 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture, specifically [[farm]]ing, remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, [[noise-induced hearing loss]], skin diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure.

===Crop cultivation systems===
[[File:An example of slash and burn agriculture practice Thailand.jpg|thumb|left|[[Slash and burn]] shifting cultivation, Thailand]]

Cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.&lt;ref name="FAO FS"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization |url=http://www.fao.org/farmingsystems/description_en.htm |title=Analysis of farming systems |accessdate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806063804/http://www.fao.org/farmingsystems/description_en.htm |archivedate=6 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCP APS"&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. Agricultural Production Systems. pp. 283–317 in "Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology". Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shifting cultivation (or [[slash and burn]]) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then [[perennial plant|perennial]] crops for a period of several years.&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;Chrispeels, M.J.; Sadava, D.E. 1994. "Farming Systems: Development, Productivity, and Sustainability". pp. 25–57 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or [[manure]]) and some manual [[pest control]]. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt;

[[File:Intercropping coconut n Tagetes erecta.jpg|thumb|[[Intercropping]] of [[coconut]] and [[Tagetes erecta|Mexican marigold]]]]

Further industrialization led to the use of [[monoculture]]s, when one [[cultivar]] is planted on a large acreage. Because of the low [[biodiversity]], nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of [[pesticide]]s and fertilizers.&lt;ref name="PCP APS" /&gt; [[Multiple cropping]], in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and [[intercropping]], when several crops are grown at the same time, are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as [[polyculture]]s.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

In [[subtropics|subtropical]] and [[arid]] environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring irrigation. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as agroforestry. In [[Temperateness|temperate]] environments, where ecosystems were predominantly [[grassland]] or [[prairie]], highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

Important categories of food crops include [[cereal]]s, legumes, forage, fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; [[Natural fiber]]s include [[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], [[silk]] and [[flax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profiles of 15 of the world's major plant and animal fibres|url=http://www.fao.org/natural-fibres-2009/about/15-natural-fibres/en/|publisher=FAO|accessdate=26 March 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific crops are cultivated in distinct [[growing region]]s throughout the world. Production is listed in millions of metric tons, based on [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] estimates.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

Animal husbandry is the breeding and raising of animals for meat, milk, [[egg (food)|eggs]], or [[wool]]), and for work and transport.&lt;ref name=Clutton-Brock&gt;{{cite book |author=Clutton-Brock, Juliet |title=A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgL-EbbB8a0C&amp;pg=PR1 |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-63495-3 |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Working animal]]s, including horses, [[mule]]s, [[ox]]en, [[water buffalo]], [[camel]]s, llamas, alpacas, [[donkey]]s, and [[dog]]s, have for centuries been used to help cultivate fields, [[harvest]] crops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Falvey | first=John Lindsay | authorlink=Lindsay Falvey | year=1985 | title=Introduction to Working Animals | isbn=978-1-86252-992-2 | location=Melbourne, Australia | publisher=MPW Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as grassland-based, mixed, and landless.&lt;ref name="FAO lps"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sere, C. |author2=Steinfeld, H. |author3=Groeneweld, J. |year=1995 |url=http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/LEAD/X6101E/x6101e00.htm#Contents|title=Description of Systems in World Livestock Systems – Current status issues and trends |publisher=U.N.

Between the 1960s and the 2000s, there was a significant increase in livestock production, both by numbers and by carcass weight, especially among beef, pigs and chickens, the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. Global cattle, sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050.&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2853.full |title=Livestock production: recent trends, future prospects |author=Thornton, Philip K. |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0134 |pmid=20713389 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |date=27 September 2010 |volume=365 |issue=1554 |pages=2853–2867 |doi-access=free |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002017/http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2853.full |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all|pmc=2935116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aquaculture]] or fish farming, the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average of 9% a year between 1975 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1663604,00.html |title=Fish Farming's Growing Dangers |journal=Time |author=Stier, Ken |date=19 September 2007|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907071708/http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1663604,00.html |archivedate=7 September 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 20th century, producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock [[breed]]s and [[crossbreed]]s that increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve [[genetic diversity]]. This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A global view of livestock biodiversity and conservation – Globaldiv |author=Ajmone-Marsan, P. |journal=Animal Genetics |date=May 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02036.x |pmid=20500752 |volume=41 |issue=supplement S1 |pages=1–5 |url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/148417 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803140941/https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/148417 |archivedate=3 August 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Broiler house.jpg|thumb|Raising [[chicken]]s intensively for meat in a broiler house]]

Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as [[shrubland]], [[rangeland]], and [[managed intensive rotational grazing|pastures]] for feeding [[ruminant]] animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30–40 million pastoralists.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; Mixed production systems use grassland, [[fodder]] crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.&lt;ref name="FAO lps" /&gt;

Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] member countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution.&lt;ref name="FAO lps" /&gt; Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in [[confined animal feeding operations]], sometimes called [[factory farming]]. Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa.&lt;ref name=LP /&gt; Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of [[growth hormone]]s, are controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-604_en.pdf |title=Growth Promoting Hormones Pose Health Risk to Consumers, Confirms EU Scientific Committee |date=23 April 2002 |accessdate=6 April 2013 |publisher=European Union |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502123053/http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-604_en.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production practices===
[[File:Fendt Tractor Ripping up Kulin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tillage|Tilling]] an arable field]]
{{see|Tillage|Crop rotation|Irrigation}}

Tillage is the practice of breaking up the soil with tools such as the plow or [[harrow (tool)|harrow]] to prepare for planting, for nutrient incorporation, or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to [[no-till farming|no-till]]. It may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.&lt;ref name="Soil"&gt;Brady, N. C.; Weil, R. R. 2002. Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCP Tillage"&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. "Land Preparation and Farm Energy" pp. 318–338 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pest control includes the management of weeds, [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, and diseases. Chemical (pesticides), biological ([[biocontrol]]), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include crop rotation, [[culling]], [[cover crop]]s, intercropping, [[compost]]ing, avoidance, and [[Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|resistance]]. Integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.&lt;ref name="PCP Pest"&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. "Pesticide Use in U.S. Crop Production" pp. 240–282 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nutrient management]] includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of utilization of manure produced by livestock.

==Crop alteration and biotechnology==
{{Main|Plant breeding}}
[[File:Wheat selection k10183-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wheat]] cultivar tolerant of high [[salinity]] (left) compared with non-tolerant variety]]

Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist [[Gregor Mendel]]. His work on [[dominant allele|dominant]] and [[recessive allele]]s, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, [[self-pollination]] and [[cross-pollination]], and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html |title=History of Plant Breeding|date=29 January 2004 |publisher=Colorado State University |accessdate=11 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121061931/http://cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html |archivedate=21 January 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved disease resistance and [[drought tolerance]], eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in [[New Zealand]]. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stadler |first=L.

The [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] to sharply increase yield by creating "high-yielding varieties". For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the US have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, growth control to avoid lodging).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ruttan |first=Vernon W. |title=Biotechnology and Agriculture: A Skeptical Perspective |journal=AgBioForum |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=54–60 |date=December 1999 |url=http://www.agbioforum.org/v2n1/v2n1a10-ruttan.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521021149/http://www.agbioforum.org/v2n1/v2n1a10-ruttan.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cassman |first=K. |title=Ecological intensification of cereal production systems: The Challenge of increasing crop yield potential and precision agriculture |journal=Proceedings of a National Academy of Sciences Colloquium, Irvine, California |date=5 December 1998 |url=http://www.lsc.psu.edu/nas/Speakers/Cassman%20manuscript.html |accessdate=11 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024001804/http://www.lsc.psu.edu/nas/Speakers/Cassman%20manuscript.html |archivedate=24 October 2007 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conversion note: 1 bushel of wheat=60&amp;nbsp;pounds (lb) ≈ 27.215&amp;nbsp;kg. 1 bushel of maize=56&amp;nbsp;pounds ≈ 25.401&amp;nbsp;kg&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including [[glyphosate]]. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5031e/y5031e0i.htm |title=Benefits and risks of the use of herbicide-resistant crops |author1=Kathrine Hauge Madsen |author2=Jens Carl Streibig |publisher=FAO |accessdate=4 May 2013 |website=Weed Management for Developing Countries |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604013840/http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5031e/y5031e0i.htm |archivedate=4 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays.

===Effects and costs===
Agriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as pesticide damage to nature (especially herbicides and insecticides), nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, and loss of natural environment. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare.&lt;ref name=Pretty2000&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pretty |year=2000 |title=An assessment of the total external costs of UK agriculture |journal=Agricultural Systems |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=113–136 |doi=10.1016/S0308-521X(00)00031-7 |first1=J. |display-authors=1 |last2=Brett |first2=C. |last3=Gee |first3=D. |last4=Hine |first4=R.

Neither included subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society.&lt;ref name=Pretty2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tegtmeier2005 /&gt;

Agriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs. Yield increases with inputs such as fertilisers and removal of pathogens, predators, and competitors (such as weeds). Costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units, such as making fields larger; this means removing [[hedge]]s, ditches and other areas of habitat. Pesticides kill insects, plants and fungi. These and other measures have cut biodiversity to very low levels on intensively farmed land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richards |first1=A.

In 2010, the [[International Resource Panel]] of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] assessed the environmental impacts of consumption and production. It found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions. Agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment, including insecticides, especially those used on cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/PriorityProducts/tabid/56053/Default.aspx |title=Priority products and materials: assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production |author=International Resource Panel |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |year=2010 |accessdate=7 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224061455/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/PriorityProducts/tabid/56053/Default.aspx |archivedate=24 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report states that "[a]gricultural operations, excluding land use changes, produce approximately 13 per cent of anthropogenic global GHG emissions.

''Our planet, our health: Report of the WHO commission on health and environment''.

Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. There is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and [[ecosystem]] resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered.

This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level of [[value added|value addition]] (e.g. more highly processed products) provided by the supply chain. [[Market concentration]] has increased in the sector as well, and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute [[economic surplus]] from producers (farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.&lt;ref name=Sexton2000&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sexton, R.

National government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products, in the form of taxation, [[Subsidy|subsidies]], tariffs and other measures.&lt;ref name=LloydCroserAnderson2013&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4101/WPS4864.pdf?sequence=1 |title=How Do Agricultural Policy Restrictions to Global Trade and Welfare Differ across Commodities? |author1=Lloyd, Peter J. |author2=Croser, Johanna L. |author3=Anderson, Kym |website=Policy Research Working Paper #4864 |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=16 April 2013 |date=March 2009 |pages=2–3 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605125346/https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4101/WPS4864.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=5 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since at least the 1960s, a combination of trade restrictions, [[exchange rate policy|exchange rate policies]] and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and the developed world. In the 1980s, non-subsidized farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products. Between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, several international agreements limited agricultural tariffs, subsidies and other trade restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/8699/wps3901.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Do Global Trade Distortions Still Harm Developing Country Farmers? |author1=Anderson, Kym |author2=Valenzuela, Ernesto  |website=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3901 |date=April 2006 |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=16 April 2013 |pages=1–2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605145451/https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/8699/wps3901.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=5 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, {{as of|2009|lc=y}}, there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the [[oilseed]]s, sesame had the greatest amount of taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy.&lt;ref name=LloydCroserAnderson2013/&gt; Despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/24/american-cotton-subsidies-illegal-obama-must-act |title=America's $24bn subsidy damages developing world cotton farmers |author=Kinnock, Glenys |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=16 April 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906122834/http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/24/american-cotton-subsidies-illegal-obama-must-act |archivedate=6 September 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unprocessed commodities such as corn, soybeans, and cattle are generally graded to indicate quality, affecting the price the producer receives.

[[Agricultural science]] is a broad multidisciplinary field of [[biology]] that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and [[social science]]s used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. It covers topics such as agronomy, plant breeding and genetics, [[plant pathology]], crop modelling, soil science, [[entomology]], production techniques and improvement, study of pests and their management, and study of adverse environmental effects such as soil degradation, [[waste management]], and [[bioremediation]].&lt;ref name="Bosso 2015"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bosso | first=Thelma | title=Agricultural Science | publisher=Callisto Reference | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-63239-058-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boucher 2018"&gt;{{cite book | last=Boucher | first=Jude | title=Agricultural Science and Management | publisher=Callisto Reference  | year=2018 | isbn=978-1-63239-965-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific study of agriculture began in the 18th century, when [[Johann Friedrich Mayer (agriculturist)|Johann Friedrich Mayer]] conducted experiments on the use of [[gypsum]] (hydrated [[calcium sulphate]]) as a fertilizer.&lt;ref name="JB 1840"&gt;John Armstrong, Jesse Buel.

[[Agricultural policy]] is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters), [[economic stability]] (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and [[environmental sustainability]] (especially [[water resource management|water policy]]), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |page=13 |title=Agricultural and food policy choices in Australia |journal=Sustainable Agriculture and Food Policy in the 21st Century: Challenges and Solutions |date=October 2010 |accessdate=22 April 2013 |author1=Hogan, Lindsay |author2=Morris, Paul |url=http://coserve.com.au/PDF/VirtualMeeting/ABARE-Agric_food_policy_CONFERENCE_PAPER-2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural policy can also touch on [[food quality]], ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and [[Conservation biology|conservation]]. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://europa.eu/european-union/topics/agriculture_en |title=Agriculture: Not Just Farming |publisher=European Union |accessdate=8 May 2018 |date=2016-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy, including consumers, agribusiness, trade lobbies and other groups. [[Agribusiness]] interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form of [[lobbying]] and [[campaign contribution]]s. Political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and [[labor union]]s, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://faculty.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-Corporatization%20of%20Fm%20Pol%20(9-10).htm |title=Corporatization of Agricultural Policy |author=Ikerd, John |journal=Small Farm Today Magazine |year=2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807024012/http://faculty.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-Corporatization%20of%20Fm%20Pol%20(9-10).htm |archivedate=7 August 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Dr. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/22/food-firms-lobbying-samuel-jutzi |title=Corporate Lobbying Is Blocking Food Reforms, Senior UN Official Warns: Farming Summit Told of Delaying Tactics by Large Agribusiness and Food Producers on Decisions that Would Improve Human Health and the Environment |author=Jowit, Juliette |date=22 September 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sneeze.JPG|thumb|Airborne diseases can be spread via respiratory droplets expelled from the mouth and nose.]]

An '''airborne disease''' is any disease that is caused by [[pathogen]]s that can be transmitted through the air. Such diseases include many of considerable importance both in [[Human medicine|human]] and [[veterinary medicine]]. The relevant pathogens may be viruses, bacteria, or fungi, and they may be spread through breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing, raising of dust, spraying of liquids, toilet flushing or any activities which generates [[aerosol]] particles or droplets. Human airborne diseases do not include conditions caused by air pollution such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), gasses and any airborne particles, though their study and prevention may help inform the science of airborne disease transmission.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==Overview==
Airborne diseases include any that are caused via transmission through the air. Many airborne diseases are of great medical importance. The pathogens transmitted may be any kind of microbe, and they may be spread in aerosols, dust or liquids. The aerosols might be generated from sources of [[infection]] such as the bodily secretions of an infected animal or person, or biological wastes such as accumulate in lofts, caves, garbage and the like. Such infected aerosols may stay suspended in air currents long enough to travel for considerable distances, though the rate of infection decreases sharply with the distance between the source and the organism infected.

Airborne pathogens or [[allergens]] often cause [[inflammation]] in the nose, throat, sinuses and the lungs. This is caused by the inhalation of these pathogens that affect a person's respiratory system or even the rest of the body. Sinus congestion, coughing and sore throats are examples of inflammation of the upper respiratory air way due to these airborne agents. Air pollution plays a significant role in airborne diseases which is linked to [[asthma]]. [[Pollutants]] are said to influence lung function by increasing air way inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutramed.com/Air/airborne_diseases.htm |title=Airborne diseases |deadurl=yes |accessdate=21 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628073116/http://www.nutramed.com/Air/airborne_diseases.htm |archivedate=28 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many common infections can spread by airborne transmission at least in some cases, including: [[Anthrax]] (inhalational), [[Chickenpox]], [[Influenza]], [[Measles]], [[Smallpox]], [[Cryptococcosis]], and [[Tuberculosis]].

Airborne diseases can also affect non-humans.  For example, [[Newcastle disease]] is an avian disease that affects many types of domestic poultry worldwide which is transmitted via airborne contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Bailey W.|author2=King, Daniel J.|title=Effect of Negative Air Ionization on Airborne Transmission of Newcastle Disease Virus|journal=Avian Diseases|date=October–December 1994|volume=38|issue=4|jstor=1592107 |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1592107?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102029596263 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Often, airborne pathogens or allergens cause inflammation in the nose, throat, sinuses, and the upper airway lungs. Upper airway inflammation causes coughing congestion, and sore throat. This is caused by the inhalation of these pathogens that affect a person's respiratory system or even the rest of the body. Sinus congestion, coughing and sore throats are examples of inflammation of the upper respiratory air way due to these airborne agents.

==Causes==
An airborne disease can be caused by exposure to a source: an infected patient or animal, by being transferred from the infected person or animal’s mouth, nose, cut, or needle puncture. People receive the disease through a portal of entry: mouth, nose, cut, or needle puncture.

==Transmission==
Airborne transmission of disease depends on several physical variables endemic to the infectious particle. Environmental factors influence the efficacy of airborne disease transmission; the most evident environmental conditions are temperature and relative humidity. The sum of all the factors that influence temperature and humidity, either meteorological (outdoor) or human (indoor), as well as other circumstances influencing the spread of the droplets containing the infectious particles, as winds, or human behavior, sum up the factors influencing the transmission of airborne diseases.

Furthermore, some infrequent or exceptional extreme events also influence the dissemination of airborne diseases, as tropical storms, hurricanes, typhoons, or monsoons.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Association of climatic factors with infectious diseases in the Arctic and subarctic region – a systematic review|pmc=4079933 | pmid=24990685 |volume=7 |year=2014 |journal=Glob Health Action |pages=24161 |vauthors=Hedlund C, Blomstedt Y, Schumann B |doi=10.3402/gha.v7.24161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate conditions determine temperature, winds and relative humidity in any territory, either all year around or at isolated moments (days or weeks).  Those are the main factors affecting the spread, duration and infectiousness of droplets containing infectious particles. For instance, influenza virus, is spread easily in northern countries (north hemisphere), because of climate conditions which favour the infectiousness of the virus but on the other hand, in those countries, lots of bacterial infections cannot spread outdoor most of the year, keeping in a latent stage.

:UV is harmful to both viruses and bacteria. UV incidence can determine the survival of the infectious particles, so that in those territories with a higher average of sunshine daily hours, and closer to the equator, some particles lose their infectious ability. Infectious particles show an increased survival in the presence of UV light at higher relative humidity levels. It is thought to be due to the protective effect of larger particle sizes, as evaporation would be less at these higher RH levels, showing a protective effect of a thicker water coat.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The effect of environmental parameters on the survival of airborne infectious agents|pmc=2843949 | pmid=19773291 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2009.0227.focus |volume=6 Suppl 6 |year=2009 |journal=J R Soc Interface |pages=S737–46 |author=Tang JW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:After isolated events, as tropical storms, has been determined that firstly the quantity of fungal spores is decreased, but a few days later, an exponentially increased number of spores is found, compared to normal conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An environmental assessment of mold concentrations and potential mycotoxin exposures in the greater Southeast Texas area.|pmid=14672314 | volume=38 |vauthors=Khan NN, Wilson BL |journal=J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng |pages=2759-72 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Socioeconomics and living conditions. They have a minor role in airborne diseases transmission, but they also have to be taken in consideration. Dwelling is an important aspect. In cities the spread of diseases is faster than in rural areas and outskirts. Normally, cities enclose quarters of buildings, in which the transmission of the viral and bacterial diseases among the neighborhoods is uncomplicated. However, suburban areas are generally more favourable for higher airborne fungal spores&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

:Nearness to large sources of water as rivers and lakes can be a cause of some outbreaks of airborne diseases, after changes in local watershed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Poor sewage systems are usually found in poor countries, especially in the rural areas, and can determine the proliferation of infectious bacteria, that once infecting animal or humans can be transmitted throughout the air.

:Working conditions, can also settle infectious airborne diseases. At indoor environments, temperature and relative humidity are mainly affected by HVAC systems (heating, ventilation and air conditioning).&lt;ref name="pmid23365758"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fernstrom A, Goldblatt M | title = Aerobiology and its role in the transmission of infectious diseases | journal = J Pathog | volume = 2013 | issue = | pages = 493960 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23365758 | pmc = 3556854 | doi = 10.1155/2013/493960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inadequate ventilation is implicated in the airborne transmission of respiratory viruses.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; Poor maintenance or defects on those systems can foster the conditions for airborne infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genesisair.com/AirborneHealthcareAquiredInfectionsHAI.htm|title=Aerosolization 's Roll in Transmission of Healthcare Acquired Conditions|accessdate=12 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609170117/http://www.genesisair.com/AirborneHealthcareAquiredInfectionsHAI.htm|archive-date=9 June 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a poor maintenance of air conditioning systems, can lead to an outbreak of Legionella (mainly Legionella pneumophila), that will spread among the population of the building (workers), before the finding of the focal point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000616.htm|title=Legionnaire disease|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hospitals, isolation of patients sick of infectious diseases has to be added as a factor, which is noticeable in poor regions, where lack of resources facilitates the spread of infectious diseases.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Prevention==
Some ways to prevent airborne diseases include [[hand washing|washing hands]], using appropriate hand disinfection, getting regular immunizations against diseases believed to be locally present, wearing a respirator and limiting time spent in the presence of any patient likely to be a source of infection.&lt;ref name="Bloodborne and Airborne Pathogens"&gt;{{cite book |last=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) |year=2011 |publisher=Jones &amp; Barlett Publishers |pages=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8hbEOpBtBJIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=books+airborne+disease&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2l0ed9ULOZ&amp;sig=eGVdwnutqF-3ojWfiMVAzvkUOck&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2iSFUMqKGImN0QHL5ICoBQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ |title=Bloodborne and Airborne Pathogens |accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Exposure to a patient or animal with an airborne disease does not guarantee receiving the disease. Because of the changes in host immunity and how much the host was exposed to the particles in the air makes a difference to how the disease affects the body.&lt;ref name="Bloodborne and Airborne Pathogens"/&gt;

Antibiotics are not prescribed for patients to control viral infections. They may however be prescribed to a flu patient for instance, to control or prevent bacterial [[secondary infection]]s. They also may be used in dealing with air-borne bacterial primary infections, such as [[pneumonic plague]].&lt;ref name="Prevent and Control Infection"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Laura Ester Ziady |author2=Nico Small |title=Prevent and Control Infection: Application Made Easy |year=2006 |publisher=Juta and Company Ltd. |pages=119–120 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSKwP3v99dYC&amp;pg=PA119 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has told consumers about vaccination and following careful hygiene and sanitation protocols for airborne disease prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/|title=Redirect - Vaccines: VPD-VAC/VPD menu page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers also have access to preventive measures like UV Air purification devices that FDA and EPA-certified laboratory test data has verified as effective in inactivating a broad array of airborne infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rxair.com/wp-content/themes/rx-wp-amz/lab-results/Eco-RX_Inc_6-13-2007_Rpt_Reprint.pdf |title=Chamber Test Analysis on Eco-RX Inc.

'''Alajuela''' '''Lake''' ({{lang-es|Lago Alajuela}}) is an artificial lake on the [[Chagres River]] created by the [[Madden Dam]] and linked to the [[Panama Canal]].  Lake Alajuela serves as a [[reservoir]] for the canal, which lies to the lake’s southwest.&lt;ref name="Earth Observatory" &gt;{{cite web
|title=Lago Alajuela, Panama
|publisher=NASA
|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=48025
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chagres, Pequení, Boquerón, Salamanca, La Puente, Indio, Piedras, San Cristóbal and Escandaloso rivers flow into the lake. The rivers of Lake Alajuela contribute 45 percent of the total water for the canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacionchagres.org/chagres-hidrologia.html |title=Parque Nacional Chagres: Hidrología |author=Fundación Parque Nacional Chagres |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=28 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509024221/http://www.fundacionchagres.org/chagres-hidrologia.html |archivedate=9 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reservoir was formerly known as Madden Lake when the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] was under U.S. administration and was renamed after control of the canal reverted to [[Panama]].&lt;ref name="Earth Observatory" /&gt;

In early December 2010, Lake Alajuela reached its highest recorded water level, prompting authorities to close the Panama Canal for 17 hours.&lt;ref name="Earth Observatory" /&gt; The canal reopened on December 9.

The '''Andalusian Health Service''' ({{lang-es|Servicio Andaluz de Salud}}, SAS), the government-run health system for the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Andalusia]], [[Spain]], was created under Ley 8/1986 de 6 de mayo (Spanish law 8/1986, 6 May 1986), as an autonomous agency attached to the Council of Health (''Consejería de Salud'') of the [[Andalusian Autonomous Government]], and belonging to the [[Andalusian Public Health System]] (''Sistema Sanitario Público Andaluz'', SSPA). Part of the [[Spanish National Health System]] (''Sistema Nacional de Salud'', SNS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/salud/contenidos/general/consejeriadesalud/l81986a.pdf Ley 8/1986 de 6 de mayo, de Creación del Servicio Andaluz de Salud], SAS, Junta de Andalucía.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1 January 2007, the SAS employs 83,132 professionals, 20,810 of them in primary care and 62,322 in specialized care.

Decree 241/2004 establishes the basic organic structure of the Council of Health and the SAS. It is compose of the following directive centers:

* Direction-Management
* General Secretariat
* Directorate General of Health Services
* Directorate General of Personnel and of Professional Development
* Directorate General of Economic Management

== Functions of the SAS ==
Article 13.3 of Decree 241/2004 of 18 May establishes the functions of the SAS:

* Management of health services in the field of promotion and protection of health, prevention of disease, health care and rehabilitation as applicable to the territory of the Autonomous Community of Andalusia
* Administration and management of the institutions, centers and of those health services that are under their dependency, organically and functionally.
* Management of the financial, material and human resources needed to fulfill these functions.

Its functions are further delineated by:
* Ley 2/1998 de Salud de Andalucía (Law 2/1998 on the Health of Andalusia)&lt;ref name="Ley 2/1998"&gt;[http://www.sas.junta-andalucia.es/library/plantillas/externa.asp?pag=/contenidos/../contenidos/profesionales/normativas/L2_1988/L19980615.pdf Ley 2/1998 de Salud de Andalucía]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Junta de Andalucía.&lt;/ref&gt;
* III Plan Andaluz de Salud 2003-2008 (Andalusian Health Plan III).
* The quality plan of the Andalusian Public Health System (SSPA).
* The SAS's own strategic plan.

== Competencies an organization of the SAS ==
[[File:Mapa sanitario de Andalucía.svg|thumb|400px|Health districts of Andalusia.]]

=== Primary care ===
Ley 2/1998 establishes a [[primary health care]] system for Andalusia. This is the first level of access for the people of Andalusia to the SSPA. Among its characteristic elements is the availability of integrated health services including preventive, curative and rehabilitative care. It is also responsible for the promotion of health, for health-related education, and for monitoring the environment with respect to health.

As of 1 January 2007 there are 1,452 primary care centers in Andalusia, located so that all citizens can readily reach such a center by public transport.

The smallest geographical unit used in organizing primary care services are the districts known as ''zonas básicas de salud'' ("basic health zones"). Each zone includes one or more primary care centers, offering health care to the population. A level up from these are districts with the organizational structures to plan, direct, manage and administer these.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/servicioandaluzdesalud/library/plantillas/externa.asp?pag=/servicioandaluzdesalud/contenidos/general/conocerSAS/O7Junio2002.pdf Consejera de Salud], ''[[Boletín Oficial de la Junta de Andalucía|BOJA]]'' nm. 70, 2002-06-15, p. 10.368 ''et. seq.'' for a detailed listing of the ''zonas básicas'' and how they are grouped.&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently (as of 2010) these have been enumerated by 197/2007.

Above and beyond these are Health Management Areas (''Áreas de Gestión Sanitaria), established by separate legislation:

* Área de Gestión Sanitaria de [[Osuna]] ([[Province of Sevilla]]), regulated by Decree 69/1996
* Área de Gestión Sanitaria Norte de [[Córdoba (Spain)|Córdoba]], ''Decree 68/1996
* Área de Gestión Sanitaria [[Campo de Gibraltar]], regulated by Order of 2 December 2002
* Área de Gestión Sanitaria Norte de [[Almería]], Order of 5 October 2006
* Área de Gestión Sanitaria Serranía de [[Province of Málaga|Málaga]], Order of 5 October 2006
* Área de Gestión Sanitaria Norte de Málaga, Order of 5 October 2006
* Área de Gestión Sanitaria Sur de [[Granada]], Order of 5 October 2006

=== Specialized medicine ===
[[Specialty (medicine)|Specialty]] care is defined under Ley 2/1998 as the second level of care.&lt;ref name="Ley 2/1998" /&gt; Specialty care provides the technical and human capabilities appropriate to diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation for conditions that cannot be handled at the primary level.

In coordination with the primary level, hospitals and their specialty centers form the necessary structure to provide this care.&lt;ref&gt;Decreto 462/1996 de 8 de octubre, sobre Ordenación de asistencia sanitaria especializada y órganos de dirección de los hospitales de la Asistencia Especializada.&lt;/ref&gt; Ésta suele ser programada y urgente, desarrollando además funciones de promoción de la salud, prevención de enfermedades, asistencia curativa y rehabilitación, así como docencia e investigación.
This includes both scheduled and urgent care, and, like the primary care, encompasses health promotion, disease prevention, curative care and rehabilitation as well as teaching and research.

===Hospitals and other centers===
SAS manages and operates 29 hospitals throughout Andalusia. In addition they manage and operate numerous more specialized facilities:

* '''[[Blood transfusion]] centers''', responsible for the supply of blood and derived [[blood products]] to public and private hospitals in Andalusia. The Regional Transfusion Centers also constitute Sectorial Tissue Banks, charged with the study, preparation and conservation of bodily tissues.
* '''Mental Health Program''', a network of [[mental health]] centers organized into:
** District Mental Health Teams
** Child/Youth Mental Health Units
** Mental Health Rehabilitation Units
** Outpatient Mental Health Hospitals
** Inpatient Mental Health Hospitals
** Therapeutic Mental Health Communities
* Autonomic Coordination of Transplants
* Urgent and Emergency Care
* User Care Services (''Servicios de Atención al Usuario'', SAU), in every health center or hospital

'''Asia Catalyst''' is an independent organization that builds strong civil society and advances the right to health for [[marginalized]] groups in Asia. It trains community-based organizations (CBOs) to meet high standards of effective and democratic governance, to establish a stable foundation for future growth, and to conduct rigorous human rights research and advocacy. It is an independent organization that places the needs of marginalized communities at the center of national, regional, and international policy making.

Since its founding in 2006 by [[Sara L.M. Davis]], the organization has opened offices in [[New York City|New York]] (United States), [[Beijing]] (China), and [[Bangkok]] (Thailand).

== Focus on marginalized groups ==
Asia Catalyst works with community-based organizations (CBOs) from marginalized groups that work on the [[right to health]]. Its partners come from communities that often experience severe and systemic rights violations, and are unable to or unaware of how to conduct effective advocacy around these issues. Partner groups include people living with HIV ([[HIV-positive people|PLHIV]]) and [[Hepatitis]], lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ([[LGBT]]) people and men who have sex with men (MSM), [[sex worker]]s, and people who use [[Recreational drug use|drugs]].

=== Definition of a CBO ===
Asia Catalyst defines a community-based organization (CBO) as a civil society group that operates within a specific community or groups of communities. Asia Catalyst works only with CBOs that represent marginalized communities. It requires that partner organizations have at least one member of the marginalized community in a decision-making position within the organization. This is meant to "ensure that the voices of marginalized communities are heard, and that Asia Catalyst's work focuses on the real, and most pressing, rights violations experienced."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asia Catalyst  » WHO WE WORK WITH|url = http://asiacatalyst.org/who-we-are-2/who-we-work-with/|website = asiacatalyst.org|access-date = 3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partner geography ===
Over the course of Asia Catalyst's history, it has partnered with hundreds of CBOs in 11 Asian countries, including [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam|Viet Nam]], [[Nepal]], [[Philippines|The Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Papua New Guinea|PNG]].

== Programs ==
Asia Catalyst supports civil society development and empowerment through tailored capacity building, research, and advocacy on issues of most concern to marginalized communities in Asia.

Asia Catalyst uses an innovative, responsive model to "ensure community voice and need is at the heart of all programming."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asia Catalyst  » WHAT WE DO|url = http://asiacatalyst.org/what-we-do/|website = AsiaCatalyst.org|access-date = 3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It incorporates a training-of-trainers methodology into all long-term programs to ensure sustainability, and continuously evaluates and adjusts its program approach to maximize impact and quality.

Asia Catalyst has four main program areas: CBO Catalyst, Regional Rights Training, tailored coaching, and advocacy.

=== CBO Catalyst ===
Asia Catalyst believes that [[Community-based organizations|community based organizations]] (CBOs) are best positioned to conduct their own advocacy as they have a unique understanding of the circumstances in which they work and the communities they represent.

Asia Catalyst’s seminal program, the CBO Catalyst,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asia Catalyst  » CBO CATALYST|url = http://asiacatalyst.org/what-we-do/cbo-catalyst/|website = asiacatalyst.org|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a capacity building program for CBO leaders from marginalized groups in Asia. Over the course of one year, Asia Catalyst convenes a group of CBO leaders for capacity building workshops that merge organizational management skills with rights-based advocacy. Participants form lasting coalitions and conduct effective advocacy on their communities’ priority issues.

=== Regional Rights Training ===
Asia Catalyst's Regional Rights Training Program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asia Catalyst  » REGIONAL RIGHTS TRAINING|url = http://asiacatalyst.org/what-we-do/regional-rights-training/|website = asiacatalyst.org|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; builds strong coalitions of like-minded CBOs '''through capacity building and implementation of human rights analysis, documentation and advocacy on a single thematic issues uniting CBOs across Asia.'''

In 2015 Asia Catalyst was supporting 16 representatives from eight CBOs from [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Vietnam|Viet Nam]] to work on ending [[Discrimination|discrimination in health care settings]] against [[people living with HIV]] (PLHIV) across the region.

=== Tailored coaching ===
Asia Catalyst provides specialized, issue-specific training to individual organizations and small '''groups''' '''with a specific skill-set need''', such as strategic planning, fundraising, or volunteer management. Tailored Coaching&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asia Catalyst  » TAILORED COACHING|url = http://asiacatalyst.org/what-we-do/tailored-coaching/|website = asiacatalyst.org|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; for CBOs typically consist of two three-day workshops with Asia Catalyst over a period of 3–6 months. Between workshops, participant organizations complete assignments aimed at implementing the knowledge they have gained at workshops, with Asia Catalyst providing additional mentor support throughout the process.

Tailored coaching focuses especially on groups from marginalized communities, such as [[sex workers]], drug users, [[LGBT]] people, and people living with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]. Much of the work has focused on grassroots groups in the [[People’s Republic of China]], as well as groups in [[Korea]], [[Thailand]], and [[Myanmar]] (Burma). Asia Catalyst’s approach uses tools that have been developed in the field with input from their marginalized groups, and helps each group to develop strategic plans, project timelines, budgets, and volunteer management systems. Once this foundation is established, groups may be assisted in developing rights documentation and advocacy projects, working on such issues as discrimination, criminalization and access to health services. Asia Catalyst trains groups to advocate with local and national officials, the [[United Nations]], and to participate in international meetings.

=== Advocacy and research ===
Asia Catalyst partners with local groups in China to conduct qualitative research to document [[human rights abuses]] that affect the [[right to health]]. These reports draw on international human rights standards and local laws to make policy recommendations. Asia Catalyst’s advocacy work has focused on compensation for victims of the HIV blood disaster, as well as discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, and rights issues facing people who use drugs and sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Sara L.M|title=Police crackdowns in China: The Health and Human Rights of Sex Workers|url=http://www.hhropenforum.org/tag/asia-catalyst/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocacy projects have been successful in achieving media attention. Asia Catalyst's December 2013 report on Custody and Education, an arbitrary detention system for female sex workers in China, was featured on the front page of the ''New York Times'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = For Prostitutes Jailed in China, Forced Labor With No Recourse|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/world/asia/for-prostitutes-in-china-jail-with-no-recourse.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2014-01-01|access-date = 2015-09-03|issn = 0362-4331|first = Andrew|last = Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in prominent Asian and international newspapers including ''The Guardian'', ''The Wall Street Journal'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=10 December 2013|title = Advocacy Group Calls China to Shut Labor Camps for Sex Workers|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/12/10/advocacy-group-calls-china-to-shut-labor-camps-for-sex-workers/|website = WSJ Blogs - China Real Time Report|access-date = 3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South China Morning Post,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Prostitutes face harsh detention, says rights group|url = http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1377814/prostitutes-face-harsh-detention-says-rights-group|access-date = 3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Taipei Times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A new year, an old occupational hazard for Chinese prostitutes - Taipei Times|url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2014/01/06/2003580626|website = www.taipeitimes.com|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its December 2014 research on the living conditions of transgender female sex workers in Beijing and Shanghai was also published in the LGBTQ Policy Journal at the Harvard Kennedy School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Announcing the Release of the 2015 LGBTQ Policy Journal {{!}} LGBTQ Policy Journal|url = http://www.hkslgbtq.com/announcing-the-release-of-the-2015-lgbtq-policy-journal/|website = www.hkslgbtq.com|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{BLP sources|date=December 2014}}
'''Baby M''' (born March 27, 1986) was the [[pseudonym]] used in the case ''In re Baby M'', 537 A.2d 1227, 109 N.J. 396 (N.J. 1988) for the infant whose legal parentage was in question.

''In re Baby M'' was a [[child custody|custody]] case that became the first American court ruling on the validity of [[surrogacy]]. William Stern entered into a surrogacy agreement with Mary Beth Whitehead, whom he and his wife Elizabeth Stern found through a newspaper ad. According to the agreement, Mary Beth Whitehead would be inseminated with William Stern's sperm (making her a traditional, as opposed to gestational, surrogate), bring the pregnancy to term, and relinquish her parental rights in favor of William's wife, Elizabeth. After the birth, however, Mary Beth decided to keep the child. She and her husband kidnapped the infant. William and Elizabeth Stern then sued to be recognized as the child's legal parents.

The New Jersey court ruled that the surrogacy contract was invalid according to public policy, recognized Mary Beth Whitehead as the child's legal mother, and ordered the Family Court to determine whether Whitehead, as mother, or Stern, as father, should have legal custody of the infant, using the conventional 'best interests of the child' analysis. Stern was awarded custody, with Whitehead having visitation rights.

At birth, Mary Beth Whitehead named Baby M. '''Sara Elizabeth Whitehead'''. She was later renamed '''Melissa Elizabeth Stern''', after William Stern was awarded legal custody.

==Background details==
In March 1984, Mary Beth Whitehead responded to an ad placed by the Infertility Center of New York in the [[Asbury Park Press]] seeking women willing to help infertile couples have children. She was a high school drop-out who had married Richard Whitehead, a truck driver who at roughly the time of her pregnancy with Baby M, did not notice losing a trailer carrying a full-sized bulldozer which uncoupled from the trailer hitch on large dump truck he was driving as he passed through South Jersey’s largest traffic circle (removed in the mid-1990s), his excessive drinking said to have contributed,&lt;ref&gt; multiple interviews with counsel for both sides, and Ms. Whitehead, her co-authored book “A Mother’s Story” (with Lotetta Schwartz-Noel) testimony in Family Court, &lt;/ref&gt; with whom she had two children, Ryan and Tuesday.&lt;ref name="New Jersey Monthly"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salkin, Allen (March 21, 1999). [https://nypost.com/1999/03/21/shes-come-a-long-way-baby-m-gifted-child-born-amid-a-two-family-uproar-thrives/ "She's Come A Long Way, Baby!: Gifted Child Born Amid a Two-Family Uproar Thrives"]. ''[[New York Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Elizabeth Stern was not infertile, but had [[multiple sclerosis]] and she and her husband Dr. William Stern, were worried about the potential health implications of [[pregnancy]], including temporary paralysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Steinbock | first =Bonnie  | authorlink =Bonnie Steinbock | coauthors = | date = | year =1988 | month = | title =Surrogate Motherhood as Prenatal Adoption | journal =Law, Medicine, and Health Care | volume =16 | issue =1 | pages =44–50 | publisher = | location = | issn = | pmid = | doi = | bibcode = | oclc = | id = | url = | language = | format = | accessdate = | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and transmitting genes that might make a child with 50% of her genes at risk of contracting the same illness.

The Sterns and Mary Beth Whitehead entered into a "surrogacy contract," according to which Whitehead would be artificially inseminated with Stern’s sperm, and relinquish her all rights in favor of The Sterns, in return for $10,000, possibly expenses. While tabloids, daily, and weekly, TV “tabloid” style shows and “slicks”, of which Time Inc.’s “People” topped a list which slid downhill to magazines published by The National Enquirer’s parent firm claimed the Sterns made their choice simply by looking at her picture, this was not a part of the initial Family Court proceedings. &lt;ref&gt; courtroom presence by this reporter who chooses to remain anonymous and regular reading of daily court files, Bergen Co. (NJ) Courthouse&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

According to the initial decision, overruled, Ms. Whitehead would be considered a traditional surrogate, as opposed to a gestational surrogate, because she was the genetic mother of the child. The Sterns, both M.D.s, feared Elizabeth’s eggs might carry genes making any child she parented subject to the possibility of developing MS. While in vitro fertilization of harvested eggs, followed by implantatation of a blastula/embryo was an available technology, Elizabeth Stern feared the then-totally-unknown genetic risk factors, the choice repeatedly subject of the Court’s questions to Stern and his counsel.&lt;ref&gt;Physical presence in the courtroom during proceedings, interviews, court filings, initial decision&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 1986, Ms. Whitehead  gave birth to a daughter,  she attempted to name, and managed, initially, to get a birth certificate the infant Sara Elizabeth Whitehead and at first a birth certificate was issued in that name &lt;ref&gt; photo, first page of plates following p92 of Whitehead‘s book,1st ed HC St Martin’s Press 1st ed, 1st printing released Mar. 14, 1989,&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after birth, days later, The infant was handed to The Sterns, who renamed her Melissa Elizabeth Stern. However, within three days of transferring physical custody to the Sterns, Whitehead, went to them and demanded that the baby be given back to her, allegedly threatening [[suicide]]. The Whiteheads, though claiming Ms. Whitehead was suffering a debilitating post-partum bladder infection at the time kidnapped Melissa, and left New Jersey, taking the infant with her. The Sterns’ counsel applied for, and the country prosecutor issued warrants the for their arrest.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

On March 31, 1987, [[New Jersey Superior Court]] Judge Harvey R. Sorkow formally validated the surrogacy contract and awarded custody of Melissa to the Sterns under a "[[best interests|best interest of the child analysis]]". During about a year of visits ordered previously by the Family Court, and visits allowed under the final decision, Ms. Whitehead took several actions either to claim the child, or incite the Sterns, including returning her wearing a hand-lettered shirt saying “I have a brother and sister”.&lt;ref&gt;testimony, photos in court records, photos released to press by counsel &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Iver|last= Peterson|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Baby M's Future |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/05/weekinreview/baby-m-s-future.html |quote=Last week, in a decision that created law in the legislative vacuum surrounding surrogate motherhood, Judge Harvey R. Sorkow of New Jersey Superior Court awarded custody of one-year-old Baby M the Dr.s Stern.

On February 3, 1988, however, the [[Supreme Court of New Jersey]], led by [[Chief Justice]] [[Robert Wilentz]], invalidated surrogacy contracts as against public policy but ''[[dictum|in dicta]]'' affirmed the trial court's use of a "best interest of the child" analysis and remanded the case to [[family court]]. On remand, the lower court awarded custody to the Sterns and Whitehead was given visitation rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Justice for All in the Baby M Case |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/04/opinion/justice-for-all-in-the-baby-m-case.html |quote=At a stroke, New Jersey's Supreme Court brought clarity and justice to the Baby M case, which so tormented the nation last spring: Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould retains her rights as a parent.

==Legal significance==
The case attracted much attention as it demonstrated that the possibilities of [[third party reproduction]] raise novel legal and social questions about the meaning of parenthood and the possibility of contracting around issues of pregnancy and childbirth.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Among other points of contention, feminists argued about whether a woman's basic human right to make decisions about her own body implied the ability to contract away parental rights to a child born to her, or whether recognizing such a right would entail too great risks of exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Mehren, Elizabeth. "[http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-31/news/vw-147_1_gloria-steinem Feminists Fight Court Ruling in Baby M Decision: Steinem, Friedan, Chesler, French Among Supporters]," ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', retrieved from latimes.com, 15 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Jersey court's finding that no contract can alter the legal position of a woman who bears a child as that child's mother seemed to settle the question of the status of surrogacy contracts in America, at least until technological advances permitting gestational surrogacy—in which a woman can bear and birth a child to whom she has no genetic relation—reopened the question in many jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Surrogacy#Legal issues|surrogacy:legal issues]] and [[Surrogacy laws by country#United States|surrogacy laws by country:United States]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At least in New Jersey, however, the Baby M. ruling continues as precedent. In 2009, New Jersey Superior Court ruled that ''In re Baby M'' applies to gestational surrogacy as well as traditional surrogacy cases, in ''[[A.G.R. v. D.R.H &amp; S.H.]]''. The intended parents were a homosexual male couple. They created an [[embryo]] using an anonymous donor ovum and the sperm of one of the husbands. The sister of the other husband carried the embryo to term and originally delivered the child to her brother and his husband, but a year later asserted her own parental rights even though she was not genetically related to the child. Judge Francis Schultz relied on ''In re Baby M'' to recognize the gestational mother as the child's legal mother. However, a later ruling in 2011 awarded full custody to the biological father.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Ted. "[http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/12/nj_gay_couple_fight_for_custod.html N.J. gay couple fight for custody of twin 5-year-old girls]," ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', retrieved from NJ.com, 25 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After reaching the age of maturity  in March 2004, Melissa Stern legally terminated Mary Beth's parental rights and formalized Elizabeth's maternity through adoption proceedings. When the controversy died down, Whitehead divorced her husband, remarried to Dean Gould, and had two more children, Austin and Morgan.&lt;ref name="New Jersey Monthly"&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 |title=Now It's Melissa's Time |work=[[New Jersey Monthly]] |quote=Twenty years ago, Melissa was known as Baby M. She was the subject of an infamous custody battle between the Sterns and Mary Beth Gould (then Mary Beth Whitehead, of Bricktown). Whitehead had responded to an ad in the Asbury Park Press seeking women willing to help infertile couples have children. The Infertility Center of New York, which had placed the ad, matched her with William and Elizabeth Stern of Tenafly. Whitehead signed a surrogacy contract, agreeing to be inseminated with William Stern’s sperm, carry the baby, and then give it up.|url=http://www.njmonthly.com/issues/2007/03-Mar/babym.htm  |accessdate=March 6, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070526004403/http://www.njmonthly.com/issues/2007/03-Mar/babym.htm |archivedate = May 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I love my family very much and am very happy to be with them," Melissa told a reporter for the ''[[New Jersey Monthly]]'', referring to the Sterns in 2004. "I'm very happy I ended up with them. I love them, they're my best friends in the whole world, and that's all I have to say about it."&lt;ref name="New Jersey Monthly"/&gt;

The biological mother, Ms. Whitehead, wrote a book about her experience in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead MB, and L. Schwartz. ''A Mother's Story: The Truth About the Baby M Case''. Publisher: St Martins Press; 1st ed. edition (February 1989) {{ISBN|0-312-02614-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
An [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Network miniseries, simply titled ''Baby M'', was broadcast in May 1988. The miniseries starred [[JoBeth Williams]] as Mary Beth Whitehead, [[John Shea]] as William, [[Bruce Weitz]] as Mary Beth's husband Rick, [[Robin Strasser]] as Elizabeth and [[Dabney Coleman]] as Gary Skoloff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094696/|title=''Baby M'' (1988) (TV)|date=22 May 1988|work=IMDb|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The miniseries received seven Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Miniseries, which it did not win. Williams, Shea, Weitz, and Coleman all received nominations for their performances, but only Shea won.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094696/awards Awards page for ''Baby M''] at the Internet Movie Database&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] for her performance.

In 1989, Mary Beth Whitehead published her own book about her experiences, ''A Mother's Story: The Truth About the Baby M Case''.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead MB, and L. Schwartz.

[[File:Real Expedición Filantrópica de la Vacuna 02.svg|thumb|Detail of expedition's routes in The Philippines]]

The '''Balmis Expedition''' (1803–1806) was a three-year mission to [[Spanish America]] and [[Asia]] led by Dr. [[Francisco Javier de Balmis]] with the aim of vaccinating millions against [[smallpox]]. [[Vaccination]], a much safer way to prevent smallpox than older methods such as [[inoculation]], had been introduced by the English physician [[Edward Jenner]] in 1798.

The Balmis expedition, officially called Real Expedición Filantrópica de la Vacuna (Royal Philanthropic Vaccine Expedition), set off from [[A Coruña]] on 30 November 1803. It may be considered the first international healthcare expedition in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author1=Carlos Franco-Paredes |author2=Lorena Lammoglia |author3=José Ignacio Santos-Preciado |title=The Spanish Royal Philanthropic Expedition to bring Smallpox vaccination to the New World and Asia in the 19th Century |publisher=Oxford Journals |volume=41 |issue=9 |pages=1285–1289 |year=2005 |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/9/1285.full |doi= 10.1086/496930 |pmid=16206103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aytolacoruna.es/en/3ciudad/31presen/3125libe.html  La Coruña: A progressive city] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041209142829/http://www.aytolacoruna.es/en/3ciudad/31presen/3125libe.html |date=2004-12-09 }}, historical information as part the official web site for the city of La Coruña.

King [[Charles IV of Spain]] supported his royal doctor Balmis since his [[Infanta]] Maria Teresa, his daughter, had died from the illness. The expedition sailed on ''Maria Pita'' and carried 22 orphan boys (aged 8 to 10) as successive carriers of the virus; Balmis, a deputy surgeon, two assistants, two first-aid practitioners, three nurses, and [[Isabel Zendal|Isabel Zendal Gómez]], the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rectoress]] of ''Casa de Expósitos'', an [[A Coruña]] orphanage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McIntyre JWR, Stuart HC | year = 1999 | title = Medicine in Canada: Smallpox and its control in Canada | url = http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/161/12/1543 | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 161 | issue = 12| pages = 1543–1547 | pmid = 10624414 | pmc=1230874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission took the [[vaccine]] to the [[Canary Islands]], [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|Colombia]], [[Royal Audiencia of Quito|Ecuador]], [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]], [[New Spain|Mexico]], the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines|Philippines]] and [[Qing Dynasty|China]].&lt;ref&gt;de Romo, Ana Cecilia Rodríguez (1997).

''Antilia:Spanish Journal of History of Natural Sciences and Technology''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ship carried also scientific instruments and translations of the ''Historical and Practical Treatise on the Vaccine'' by Moreau de Sarthe to be distributed to the local vaccine commissions to be founded.

In [[Puerto Rico]], the local population had already been inoculated from the Danish colony of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]]. In [[Captaincy General of Venezuela|Venezuela]], the expedition divided at [[La Guayra]]. José Salvany, the deputy surgeon, went toward today's Colombia and the Viceroyalty of Peru (Venezuela, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Bolivia). They took seven years and the toils of the voyage brought death to Salvany ([[Cochabamba]], 1810). Balmis went to Caracas and later to [[Havana]]. The local poet [[Andrés Bello]] wrote an ode to Balmis. In New Spain, Balmis took 25 orphans to maintain the infection during the crossing of the Pacific. In the Philippines, they received help from the Catholic church, which was initially reluctant until [[Governor-General of the Philippines | Governor-General]] [[Rafael María de Aguilar y Ponce de León | Rafael Aguilar]] made an example by vaccinating his five children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/109261/vaccine-expedition-early-1800s|title=Vaccine expedition in early 1800s|last=Ocampo|first=Ambeth R.|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balmis sent most of the expedition back to New Spain while he went on to China, where he visited [[Macau]] and [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. On his way back to Spain, Balmis convinced the British authorities of [[Saint Helena]] (1806) to be vaccinated.

[[Julia Alvarez]] wrote a fictional account of the expedition from the perspective of its only female member in ''Saving the World'' (2006).

'''Benzene''' is an important [[organic compound|organic]] [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] [[Carbon|C]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;[[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The benzene molecule is composed of six carbon atoms joined in a ring with one hydrogen atom attached to each. As it contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms, benzene is classed as a [[hydrocarbon]].

Benzene is a natural constituent of [[petroleum|crude oil]] and is one of the elementary [[petrochemical]]s. Due to the cyclic continuous [[pi bond]] between the carbon atoms, benzene is classed as an [[aromatic hydrocarbon]], the second [''n'']-[[annulene]] ([6]-annulene). It is sometimes abbreviated [[Phenyl|Ph]]H. Benzene is a [[color]]less and highly [[flammable]] liquid with a sweet smell, and is responsible for the aroma around petrol (gas) stations. It is used primarily as a precursor to the manufacture of chemicals with more complex structure, such as [[ethylbenzene]] and [[cumene]], of which billions of kilograms are produced annually. As benzene has a high [[octane number]], aromatic derivatives like [[toluene]] and [[xylene]] typically comprise up to 25% of gasoline (petrol). Benzene itself has been limited to less than 1% in gasoline because it is a known human [[carcinogen]]. Most non-industrial applications have been limited as well for the same reason.

==History==

===Discovery===
The word "benzene" derives from "gum benzoin" ([[benzoin resin]]), an aromatic resin known to European pharmacists and perfumers since the 15th century as a product of southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;The word "benzoin" is derived from the Arabic expression "''luban jawi''", or "[[frankincense]] of [[Java]]". {{cite book|last=Morris|first=Edwin T.|title=Fragrance: The Story of Perfume from Cleopatra to Chanel|year=1984|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=978-0684181950|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; An acidic material was derived from benzoin by [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], and named "flowers of benzoin", or benzoic acid. The hydrocarbon derived from benzoic acid thus acquired the name benzin, benzol, or benzene.&lt;ref name=rocke&gt;{{cite journal|author= Rocke, A. J. |title=Hypothesis and Experiment in the Early Development of Kekule's Benzene Theory|journal=[[Annals of Science]]|volume=42|year=1985|pages=355–81|doi =10.1080/00033798500200411|issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Faraday]] first isolated and identified benzene in 1825 from the oily residue derived from the production of illuminating gas, giving it the name ''bicarburet of hydrogen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Faraday, M. |title= On new compounds of carbon and hydrogen, and on certain other products obtained during the decomposition of oil by heat|journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]|volume=115|year=1825|pages=440–466|url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k559209/f473.image|doi=10.1098/rstl.1825.0022|jstor=107752|authorlink= Michael Faraday}}  On pages 443–450, Faraday discusses "bicarburet of hydrogen" (benzene).  On pages 449–450, he shows that benzene's empirical formula is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, although he doesn't realize it because he (like most chemists at that time) used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Kaiser, R. |title=Bicarburet of Hydrogen. Reappraisal of the Discovery of Benzene in 1825 with the Analytical Methods of 1968|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English|volume=7|issue=5|year=1968|pages=345–350|doi=10.1002/anie.196803451}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1833, [[Eilhard Mitscherlich]] produced it by [[distillation|distilling]] [[benzoic acid]] (from [[gum benzoin]]) and [[calcium oxide|lime]]. He gave the compound the name ''benzin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Mitscherlich, E. |title=Über das Benzol und die Säuren der Oel- und Talgarten |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEs9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |trans-title=On benzol and oily and fatty types of acids |journal=[[Liebigs Annalen|Annalen der Pharmacie]]|volume=9|issue=1|year=1834|pages=39–48| doi=10.1002/jlac.18340090103 }}  In a footnote on page 43, Liebig, the journal's editor, suggested changing Mitscherlich's original name for benzene (namely, "benzin") to "benzol", because the suffix "-in" suggested that it was an alkaloid (e.g., Chinin (quinine)), which benzene isn't, whereas the suffix "-ol" suggested that it was oily, which benzene is.  Thus on page 44, Mitscherlich states:  ''"Da diese Flüssigkeit aus der Benzoësäure gewonnen wird, und wahrscheinlich mit den Benzoylverbindungen im Zusammenhang steht, so gibt man ihr am besten den Namen Benzol, da der Name Benzoïn schon für die mit dem Bittermandelöl isomerische Verbindung von Liebig und Wöhler gewählt worden ist."''  (Since this liquid [benzene] is obtained from benzoic acid and probably is related to benzoyl compounds, the best name for it is "benzol", since the name "benzoïn" has already been chosen, by Liebig and Wöhler, for the compound that's isomeric with the oil of bitter almonds [benzaldehyde].)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836, the French chemist [[Auguste Laurent]] named the substance "phène";&lt;ref&gt;Laurent, Auguste (1836) "Sur la chlorophénise et les acides chlorophénisique et chlorophénèsique," ''Annales de Chemie et de Physique'', vol. 63, pp. 27–45, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 44]:  ''"Je donne le nom de phène au radical fondamental des acides précédens (φαινω, j'éclaire), puisque la benzine se trouve dans le gaz de l'éclairage."''  (I give the name of "phène" (φαινω, I illuminate) to the fundamental radical of the preceding acids, because benzene is found in illuminating gas.)&lt;/ref&gt; this word has become the root of the English word "[[phenol]]", which is [[hydroxylated]] benzene, and "[[phenyl]]", the radical formed by abstraction of a hydrogen atom ([[free radical]] H•) from benzene.
[[File:Historic Benzene Formulae Kekulé (original).png|thumb|left|300px|Kekulé's 1872 modification of his 1865 theory, illustrating rapid alternation of double bonds&lt;ref&gt;Critics pointed out a  problem with Kekulé's original (1865) structure for benzene:  Whenever benzene underwent substitution at the ortho position, two distinguishable isomers should have resulted, depending on whether a double bond or a single bond existed between the carbon atoms to which the substituents were attached; however, no such isomers were observed.  In 1872, Kekulé suggested that benzene had two complementary structures and that these forms rapidly interconverted, so that if there were a double bond between any pair of carbon atoms at one instant, that double bond would become a single bond at the next instant (and vice versa).  To provide a mechanism for the conversion process, Kekulé proposed that the valency of an atom is determined by the frequency with which it collided with its neighbors in a molecule.  As the carbon atoms in the benzene ring collided with each other, each carbon atom would collide twice with one neighbor during a given interval and then twice with its other neighbor during the next interval.  Thus, a double bond would exist with one neighbor during the first interval and the other neighbor during the next interval.  See [http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Kekule_-_Ueber_einige_Condensationsproducte_des_Aldehyds.pdf&amp;page=10 pages 86–89] of Auguste Kekulé (1872) "Ueber einige Condensationsprodukte des Aldehyds" (On some condensation products of aldehydes), ''Liebig's Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''162'''(1): 77–124, 309–320.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Dewar benzene]] and [[prismane]] are different chemicals that have Dewar's and Ladenburg's structures. Thiele and Kekulé's structures are used today.]]
The empirical formula for benzene was long known, but its highly [[Saturation (chemistry)|polyunsaturated]] structure, with just one [[hydrogen]] atom for each [[carbon]] atom, was challenging to determine. [[Archibald Scott Couper]] in 1858 and [[Joseph Loschmidt]] in 1861&lt;ref&gt;J. Loschmidt, ''Chemische Studien'' (Vienna, Austria-Hungary: Carl Gerold's Sohn, 1861), 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=ksw5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA30 pp. 30, 65].&lt;/ref&gt; suggested possible structures that contained multiple double bonds or multiple rings, but too little evidence was then available to help chemists decide on any particular structure.

In 1865, the German chemist [[August Kekulé|Friedrich August Kekulé]] published a paper in French (for he was then teaching in Francophone Belgium) suggesting that the structure contained a ring of six carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds. The next year he published a much longer paper in German on the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kekulé, F. A. |title= Sur la constitution des substances aromatiques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFsSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA98|journal=Bulletin de la Societe Chimique de Paris|volume=3|year=1865|pages= 98–110|authorlink= Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz}}  On p. 100, Kekulé suggests that the carbon atoms of benzene could form a "chaîne fermée" (a closed chain, a loop).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Kekulé, F. A.|title=Untersuchungen über aromatische Verbindungen  (Investigations of aromatic compounds)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNryAAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA129|doi = 10.1002/jlac.18661370202|journal=Liebigs Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume=137 |year=1866|pages=129–36|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kekulé used evidence that had accumulated in the intervening years—namely, that there always appeared to be only one [[isomer]] of any [[Derivative (chemistry)|monoderivative]] of benzene, and that there always appeared to be exactly three isomers of every disubstituted derivative—now understood to correspond to the ortho, meta, and para patterns of [[Arene substitution patterns|arene substitution]]—to argue in support of his proposed structure.&lt;ref&gt;Rocke, A. J. (2010) ''Image and Reality: Kekule, Kopp, and the Scientific Imagination'', University of Chicago Press, pp. 186–227, {{ISBN|0226723356}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kekulé's symmetrical ring could explain these curious facts, as well as benzene's 1:1 carbon-hydrogen ratio.

The new understanding of benzene, and hence of all aromatic compounds, proved to be so important for both pure and applied chemistry that in 1890 the German Chemical Society organized an elaborate appreciation in Kekulé's honor, celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of his first benzene paper. Here Kekulé spoke of the creation of the theory. He said that he had discovered the ring shape of the benzene molecule after having a reverie or day-dream of a snake seizing its own tail (this is a common symbol in many ancient cultures known as the [[Ouroboros]] or [[Endless knot]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Read | first = John | title = From alchemy to chemistry | year = 1995 | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | isbn = 9780486286907 | pages = 179–180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This vision, he said, came to him after years of studying the nature of carbon-carbon bonds. This was 7 years after he had solved the problem of how carbon atoms could bond to up to four other atoms at the same time. Curiously, a similar, humorous depiction of benzene had appeared in 1886 in a pamphlet entitled ''Berichte der Durstigen Chemischen Gesellschaft'' (Journal of the Thirsty Chemical Society), a parody of the ''Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft'', only the parody had monkeys seizing each other in a circle, rather than snakes as in Kekulé's anecdote.&lt;ref&gt;English translation {{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed042p266|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=42|year=1965|pages=266–67|title=Kekule's benzene ring theory: A subject for lighthearted banter|last1=Wilcox|first1=David H.|last2=Greenbaum|first2=Frederick R.|issue=5|bibcode = 1965JChEd..42..266W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have suggested that the parody was a lampoon of the snake anecdote, possibly already well known through oral transmission even if it had not yet appeared in print.&lt;ref name=rocke/&gt;  Kekulé's 1890 speech&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Kekulé, F.

===Nomenclature===
The German chemist [[Wilhelm Körner]] suggested the prefixes ortho-, meta-, para- to distinguish di-substituted benzene derivatives in 1867; however, he did not use the prefixes to distinguish the relative positions of the substituents on a benzene ring.&lt;ref&gt;See:

From p. 169:  ''"On distingue facilement ces trois séries, dans lesquelles les dérivés bihydroxyliques ont leurs terms correspondants, par les préfixes ortho-, para- et mêta-."''  (One easily distinguishes these three series – in which the dihydroxy derivatives have their corresponding terms – by the prefixes ortho-, para- and meta-.)

===Early applications===
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, benzene was used as an after-shave lotion because of its pleasant smell. Prior to the 1920s, benzene was frequently used as an industrial solvent, especially for [[degreasing]] metal. As its toxicity became obvious, benzene was supplanted by other solvents, especially [[toluene]] (methylbenzene), which has similar physical properties but is not as carcinogenic.

In 1903, [[Ludwig Roselius]] popularized the use of benzene to [[decaffeination|decaffeinate]] [[coffee]]. This discovery led to the production of [[Sanka]]. This process was later discontinued. Benzene was historically used as a significant component in many consumer products such as [[Liquid Wrench]], several [[paint stripper]]s, [[rubber cement]]s, spot removers, and other products. Manufacture of some of these benzene-containing formulations ceased in about 1950, although Liquid Wrench continued to contain significant amounts of benzene until the late 1970s.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Occurrence===
Trace amounts of benzene are found in petroleum and coal.  It is a byproduct of the incomplete combustion of many materials.  For commercial use, until [[World War II]], most benzene was obtained as a by-product of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] production (or "coke-oven light oil") for the [[steel]] industry. However, in the 1950s, increased demand for benzene, especially from the growing [[polymer]]s industry, necessitated the production of benzene from petroleum. Today, most benzene comes from the [[petrochemical]] industry, with only a small fraction being produced from coal.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

[[X-ray diffraction]] shows that all six carbon-carbon bonds in benzene are of the same length, at 140 [[picometre]]s (pm) {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. The C–C [[bond length]]s are greater than a double bond (135 pm) but shorter than a single bond (147 pm).&lt;!--147pm is the sp2–sp2 single bond length without conjugation --&gt; This intermediate distance is consistent with electron [[Delocalized electron|delocalization]]: the electrons for C–C bonding are distributed equally between each of the six carbon atoms. Benzene has 6 hydrogen atoms – fewer than the corresponding parent [[alkane]], [[hexane]].

To accurately reflect the nature of the bonding, benzene is often depicted with a circle inside a hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms.

Derivatives of benzene occur sufficiently often as a component of organic molecules that the [[Unicode]] Consortium has allocated a symbol in the [[Miscellaneous Technical (Unicode)|Miscellaneous Technical]] block with the code U+232C (⌬) to represent it with three double bonds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/232c/index.htm |title=Unicode Character 'BENZENE RING' (U+232C) |accessdate=2009-01-16|website=fileformat.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; and U+23E3 (⏣) for a delocalized version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/23e3/index.htm |title=Unicode Character 'BENZENE RING WITH CIRCLE' (U+23E3) |accessdate=2009-01-16|website=fileformat.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benzene derivatives==
{{Main|Aromatic hydrocarbons|Alkylbenzenes}}
Many important chemical compounds are derived from benzene by replacing one or more of its hydrogen atoms with another [[functional group]]. Examples of simple benzene derivatives are [[phenol]], [[toluene]], and [[aniline]], abbreviated PhOH, PhMe, and PhNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Linking benzene rings gives [[biphenyl]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;–C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Further loss of hydrogen gives "fused" aromatic hydrocarbons, such as [[naphthalene]] and [[anthracene]]. The limit of the fusion process is the hydrogen-free allotrope of carbon, [[graphite]].

In [[heterocyclic chemistry|heterocycles]], carbon atoms in the benzene ring are replaced with other elements. The most important variations contain [[nitrogen]]. Replacing one CH with N gives the compound [[pyridine]], C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N. Although benzene and pyridine are ''structurally'' related, benzene cannot be converted into pyridine. Replacement of a second CH bond with N gives, depending on the location of the second N, [[pyridazine]], [[pyrimidine]], and [[pyrazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/heterocy.htm | title = Heterocyclic Chemistry: Heterocyclic Compounds | publisher = [[Michigan State University]], Department of Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Four chemical processes contribute to industrial benzene production: [[catalytic reforming]], [[toluene]] hydrodealkylation, toluene disproportionation, and [[steam cracking]]. According to the [[ATSDR]] Toxicological Profile for benzene, between 1978 and 1981, catalytic reformats accounted for approximately 44–50% of the total U.S benzene production.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Hillis O. Folkins|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|encyclopedia=Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|year=2005|doi=10.1002/14356007.a03_475|isbn=978-3527306732|chapter=Benzene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catalytic reforming===
In catalytic reforming, a mixture of [[hydrocarbon]]s with boiling points between 60–200&amp;nbsp;°C is blended with [[hydrogen]] gas and then exposed to a [[bifunctional]] [[platinum(II) chloride|platinum chloride]] or [[rhenium]] chloride [[catalyst]] at 500–525&amp;nbsp;°C and pressures ranging from 8–50 atm. Under these conditions, [[aliphatic]] hydrocarbons form rings and lose hydrogen to become aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic products of the reaction are then separated from the reaction mixture (or reformate) by [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extraction]] with any one of a number of [[solvent]]s, including [[diethylene glycol]] or [[sulfolane]], and benzene is then separated from the other aromatics by distillation. The extraction step of aromatics from the reformate is designed to produce aromatics with lowest non-aromatic components. Recovery of the aromatics, commonly referred to as [[BTX (chemistry)|BTX]] (benzene, toluene and xylene isomers), involves such extraction and distillation steps. There are a good many licensed processes available for extraction of the aromatics.

In similar fashion to this catalytic reforming, [[UOP LLC|UOP]] and [[BP]] commercialized a method from LPG (mainly propane and butane) to aromatics.

===Toluene hydrodealkylation===
Toluene [[hydrodealkylation]] converts [[toluene]] to benzene. In this hydrogen-intensive process, toluene is mixed with hydrogen, then passed over a [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], or [[platinum]] [[oxide]] catalyst at 500–600&amp;nbsp;°C and 40–60 atm pressure. Sometimes, higher temperatures are used instead of a catalyst (at the similar reaction condition). Under these conditions, toluene undergoes dealkylation to benzene and [[methane]]:

:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

This irreversible reaction is accompanied by an equilibrium side reaction that produces
[[biphenyl]] (aka diphenyl) at higher temperature:

If the raw material stream contains much non-aromatic components (paraffins or naphthenes), those are likely decomposed to lower hydrocarbons such as methane, which increases the consumption of hydrogen.

A typical reaction yield exceeds 95%. Sometimes, [[xylene]]s and heavier aromatics are used in place of toluene, with similar efficiency.

This is often called "on-purpose" methodology to produce benzene, compared to conventional BTX (benzene-toluene-xylene) extraction processes.

===Toluene disproportionation===
Where a chemical complex has similar demands for both benzene and [[xylene]], then toluene [[disproportionation]] ('''TDP''') may be an attractive alternative to the toluene hydrodealkylation. In the broad sense, two toluene molecules are reacted and the methyl groups rearranged from one toluene molecule to the other, yielding one benzene molecule and one xylene molecule.

Given that demand for ''para''-xylene ([[P-Xylene|''p''-xylene]]) substantially exceeds demand for other xylene isomers, a refinement of the TDP process called '''Selective TDP''' (STDP) may be used. In this process, the xylene stream exiting the TDP unit is approximately 90% paraxylene. In some current catalytic systems, even the benzene-to-xylenes ratio is decreased (more xylenes) when the demand of xylenes is higher.

===Steam cracking===
[[Steam cracking]] is the process for producing [[ethylene]] and other [[alkene]]s from [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic hydrocarbons]]. Depending on the feedstock used to produce the olefins, steam cracking can produce a benzene-rich liquid by-product called ''[[pyrolysis gasoline]]''. Pyrolysis gasoline can be blended with other hydrocarbons as a gasoline additive, or routed through an extraction process to recover [[BTX (chemistry)|BTX]] aromatics (benzene, toluene and xylenes).

=== Other methods ===
Although of no commercial significance, many other routes to benzene exist. [[Phenol]] and [[halobenzene]]s can be reduced with metals. [[Benzoic acid]] and its salts undergo [[decarboxylation]] to benzene.  Via the reaction the [[diazonium compound]] with [[hypophosphorus acid]] [[aniline]] gives benzene. [[Trimerization]] of [[acetylene]] gives benzene.

==Uses==
Benzene is used mainly as an intermediate to make other chemicals, above all [[ethylbenzene]], [[cumene]], [[cyclohexane]], nitrobenzene, and alkylbenzene. More than half of the entire benzene production is processed into ethylbenzene, a precursor to [[styrene]], which is used to make polymers and plastics like polystyrene and EPS. Some 20% of the benzene production is used to manufacture cumene, which is needed to produce [[phenol]] and acetone for resins and adhesives. [[Cyclohexane]] consumes c. 10% of the world's benzene production; it is primarily used in the manufacture of nylon fibers, which are processed into textiles and engineering plastics. Smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of [[rubber]]s, [[lubricant]]s, [[dye]]s, [[detergent]]s, [[drug]]s, [[explosive]]s, and [[pesticide]]s. In 2013, the biggest consumer country of benzene was China, followed by the USA. Benzene production is currently expanding in the Middle East and in Africa, whereas production capacities in Western Europe and North America are stagnating.&lt;ref name="Ceresana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/benzene/|title=Market Study: Benzene (2nd edition), Ceresana, August 2014|publisher=ceresana.com|accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toluene]] is now often used as a substitute for benzene, for instance as a fuel additive. The solvent-properties of the two are similar, but toluene is less toxic and has a wider liquid range. Toluene is also processed into benzene.&lt;ref name="CeresanaB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/toluene/|title=Market Study: Toluene, Ceresana, January 2015|publisher=ceresana.com|accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Component of gasoline===
As a [[gasoline]] (petrol) additive, benzene increases the [[octane rating]] and reduces [[Engine knocking|knocking]]. As a consequence, gasoline often contained several percent benzene before the 1950s, when [[tetraethyl lead]] replaced it as the most widely used antiknock additive. With the global phaseout of leaded gasoline, benzene has made a comeback as a gasoline additive in some nations. In the [[United States]], concern over its negative health effects and the possibility of benzene's entering the [[groundwater]] have led to stringent regulation of gasoline's benzene content, with limits typically around 1%.&lt;ref&gt;Kolmetz, Gentry, Guidelines for BTX Revamps, AIChE 2007 Spring Conference&lt;/ref&gt; European petrol specifications now contain the same 1% limit on benzene content. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] introduced new regulations in 2011 that lowered the benzene content in gasoline to 0.62%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/EPA-AIR/2006/March/Day-29/a2315b.htm |title=Control of Hazardous Air Pollutants From Mobile Sources |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |page=15853 |accessdate=2008-06-27 |date=2006-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205233108/http://www.epa.gov/EPA-AIR/2006/March/Day-29/a2315b.htm |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In many European languages, the word for petroleum or gasoline is an exact cognate of "benzene".

==Reactions==
The most common reactions of benzene involve substitution of a proton by other groups.&lt;ref name="StranksEtAl1970"&gt;

:[[File:OChem-Mech-ElectrophilicAromaticSubstitution-General.png|thumb|center|450px|Electrophilic aromatic substitution of benzene]]

The most widely practiced example of this reaction is the [[ethylation]] of benzene.
::[[File:EtC6H5route.png|320 px]]
Approximately 24,700,000 tons were produced in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Vincent A.; Fallon, Kevin J. and Gelbke, Heinz-Peter (2005) "Ethylbenzene" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a10_035.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Highly instructive but of far less industrial significance is the [[Friedel-Crafts alkylation]] of benzene (and many other aromatic rings) using an [[alkyl halide]] in the presence of a strong Lewis acid catalyst. Similarly, the [[Friedel-Crafts acylation]] is a related example of [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]]. The reaction involves the [[acylation]] of benzene (or many other aromatic rings) with an [[acyl chloride]] using a strong [[Lewis acid]] [[catalyst]] such as [[aluminium chloride]] or [[Iron(III) chloride]].

[[File:Benzen acylowany.svg|thumb|center|300px|Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene by acetyl chloride]]

===Sulfonation, chlorination, nitration===
Using electrophilic aromatic substitution, many functional groups are introduced onto the benzene framework.  [[Aromatic sulfonation|Sulfonation]] of benzene involves the use of [[oleum]], a mixture of sulfuric acid with [[sulfur trioxide]]. Sulfonated benzene derivatives are useful [[detergent]]s.  In [[nitration]], benzene reacts with nitronium ions (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), which is a strong electrophile produced by combining sulfuric and nitric acids.  [[Nitrobenzene]] is the precursor to [[aniline]].  Chlorination is achieved with chlorine to give [[chlorobenzene]] in the presence of a catalyst such as aluminium tri-chloride.

===Hydrogenation===
Via [[hydrogenation]], benzene and its derivatives convert to [[cyclohexane]] and derivatives.  This reaction is achieved by the use of high pressures of [[hydrogen]] in the presence of [[heterogeneous catalyst]]s, such as finely divided [[nickel]].  Whereas alkenes can be hydrogenated near room temperatures, benzene and related compounds are more reluctant substrates, requiring temperatures &gt;100&amp;nbsp;°C.  This reaction is practiced on a large scale industrially. In the absence of the catalyst, benzene is impervious to hydrogen.  Hydrogenation cannot be stopped to give cyclohexene or cyclohexadienes as these are superior substrates.  [[Birch reduction]], a non catalytic process, however selectively hydrogenates benzene to the diene.

===Metal complexes===
Benzene is an excellent [[ligand]] in the [[complex (chemistry)|organometallic]] chemistry of low-valent metals. Important examples include the sandwich and half-sandwich complexes, respectively, [[Bis(benzene)chromium|Cr(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[(Benzene)ruthenium dichloride dimer|[RuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].

==Health effects==

Benzene is classified as a [[carcinogen]], which increases the risk of cancer and other illnesses, and is also a notorious cause of bone marrow failure. Substantial quantities of epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data link benzene to aplastic anemia, acute leukemia, bone marrow abnormalities and cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;Kasper, Dennis L.''et al.''

The [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API) stated in 1948 that "it is generally considered that the only absolutely safe concentration for benzene is zero".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030310145140/http://hobsonlaw.com/benzene_pages/pdffile.pdf American Petroleum Institute, API Toxicological Review, Benzene, September 1948], Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/ref&gt; There is no safe exposure level; even tiny amounts can cause harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Martyn T.|date=2010-01-01|title=Advances in Understanding Benzene Health Effects and Susceptibility|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=31|issue=1|pages=133–148|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103646|pmc=4360999|pmid=20070208}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[US Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS) classifies benzene as a human [[carcinogen]]. Long-term exposure to excessive levels of benzene in the air causes [[leukemia]], a potentially fatal [[cancer]] of the blood-forming organs. In particular, [[acute myeloid leukemia]] or [[acute nonlymphocytic leukemia]] (AML &amp; ANLL) is not disputed to be caused by benzene.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], [http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/suppl7/suppl7.pdf IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Overall Evaluations of Carcinogenicity: An Updating of IARC Monographs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306134819/http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/suppl7/suppl7.pdf |date=2008-03-06 }}, Volumes 1 to 42, Supplement 7&lt;/ref&gt; IARC rated benzene as "known to be carcinogenic to humans" (Group 1).

As benzene is ubiquitous in gasoline and hydrocarbon fuels are in use everywhere, human exposure to benzene is a global health problem.  Benzene targets liver, kidney, lung, heart and the brain and can cause [[DNA]] strand breaks, [[chromosomal]] damage, etc. Benzene causes [[cancer]] in animals including humans.

==Exposure to benzene==
According to the [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR) (2007), benzene is both an anthropogenically produced and naturally occurring chemical from processes that include: volcanic eruptions, wild fires, synthesis of chemicals such as [[phenol]], production of [[synthetic fiber]]s, and fabrication of [[rubber]]s, [[lubricant]]s, [[pesticide]]s, medications, and [[dye]]s. The major sources of benzene exposure are [[tobacco]] smoke, automobile service stations, exhaust from motor vehicles, and industrial emissions; however, ingestion and dermal absorption of benzene can also occur through contact with contaminated water. Benzene is hepatically metabolized and excreted in the [[urine]]. Measurement of air and water levels of benzene is accomplished through collection via [[activated charcoal]] tubes, which are then analyzed with a [[gas chromatograph]]. The measurement of benzene in humans can be accomplished via [[Urine test|urine]], [[Blood test|blood]], and [[breath test]]s; however, all of these have their limitations because benzene is rapidly metabolized in the human body.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. (2007). [http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp3.pdf Benzene: Patient information sheet.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benzene exposure limits===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has set a [[maximum contaminant level]] (MCL) for benzene in [[drinking water]] at 0.005&amp;nbsp;mg/L (5 ppb), as promulgated via the U.S. National Primary Drinking Water Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/index.cfm#Organic Drinking Water Contaminants|Organic Chemicals|Benzene]. Water.epa.gov. Retrieved on 2014-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt; This regulation is based on preventing benzene leukemogenesis. The maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG), a nonenforceable health goal that would allow an adequate margin of safety for the prevention of adverse effects, is zero benzene concentration in drinking water. The EPA requires that spills or accidental releases into the environment of 10 pounds (4.5&amp;nbsp;kg) or more of benzene be reported.

The U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set a permissible exposure limit of 1 part of benzene per million parts of air (1 ppm) in the workplace during an 8-hour workday, 40-hour workweek. The short term exposure limit for airborne benzene is 5 ppm for 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osha.gov/dts/chemicalsampling/data/CH_220100.html Chemical Sampling Information Benzene]. Osha.gov. Retrieved on 2011-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; These legal limits were based on studies demonstrating compelling evidence of health risk to workers exposed to benzene. The risk from exposure to 1 ppm for a working lifetime has been estimated as 5 excess leukemia deaths per 1,000 employees exposed. (This estimate assumes no threshold for benzene's carcinogenic effects.) OSHA has also established an action level of 0.5 ppm to encourage even lower exposures in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100610004540/http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/benzene/standards_regulations.html Benzene Toxicity: Standards and Regulations|ATSDR – Environmental Medicine &amp; Environmental Health Education – CSEM].

The U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) revised the [[Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health]] (IDLH) concentration for benzene to 500 ppm. The current NIOSH definition for an IDLH condition, as given in the NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic, is one that poses a threat of exposure to airborne contaminants when that exposure is likely to cause death or immediate or delayed permanent adverse health effects or prevent escape from such an environment [NIOSH 2004]. The purpose of establishing an IDLH value is (1) to ensure that the worker can escape from a given contaminated environment in the event of failure of the respiratory protection equipment and (2) is considered a maximum level above which only a highly reliable [[Self-contained breathing apparatus|breathing apparatus]] providing maximum worker protection is permitted [NIOSH 2004&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2005-100/pdfs/05-100.pdf NIOSH respirator selection logic] (October 2004).

This program must be administered by a suitably trained program administrator. Employers must use the assigned protection factors (APF) listed in Table 1 of 29 CFR 1910.134 to select a respirator that meets or exceeds the required level of employee protection. For benzene:
* If there is a potential for exposure to 0.1 ppm, a NIOSH-approved half face respirator must be worn with an organic vapor cartridge (APF 10).
* If there is a potential for exposure to 0.5 ppm, a NIOSH-approved full face respirator must be worn with an organic vapor cartridge (APF 50).
* Where the potential exists for exposure to over 5 ppm, a NIOSH-approved air-supplied respirator with a full facepiece operated under pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode must be used (APF 1,000).--&gt;

===Toxicology===

====Biomarkers of exposure====
Several tests can determine exposure to benzene. Benzene itself can be measured in breath, blood or urine, but such testing is usually limited to the first 24 hours post-exposure due to the relatively rapid removal of the chemical by exhalation or biotransformation. Most people in developed countries have measureable baseline levels of benzene and other aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons in their blood. In the body, benzene is enzymatically converted to a series of oxidation products including [[muconic acid]], [[phenylmercapturic acid]], [[phenol]], [[catechol]], [[hydroquinone]] and [[Hydroxyquinol|1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene]]. Most of these metabolites have some value as biomarkers of human exposure, since they accumulate in the urine in proportion to the extent and duration of exposure, and they may still be present for some days after exposure has ceased. The current ACGIH biological exposure limits for occupational exposure are 500 μg/g creatinine for muconic acid and 25 μg/g creatinine for phenylmercapturic acid in an end-of-shift urine specimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashley|pmid=8013127|first1=DL|year=1994|pages=1401–4|issue=7 Pt 2|last2=Bonin|volume=40|journal=Clinical Chemistry|first2=MA|last3=Cardinali|first3=FL|last4=McCraw|first4=JM|last5=Wooten|first5=JV|title=Blood concentrations of volatile organic compounds in a nonoccupationally exposed US population and in groups with suspected exposure|url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/reprint/40/7/1401.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fustinoni S, Buratti M, Campo L, Colombi A, Consonni D, Pesatori AC, Bonzini M, Farmer P, Garte S, Valerio F, Merlo DF, Bertazzi PA |title=Urinary t,t-muconic acid, S-phenylmercapturic acid and benzene as biomarkers of low benzene exposure|journal=Chemico-biological Interactions|volume=153–154|pages=253–6|year=2005|pmid=15935823|doi=10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ACGIH (2009).

====Biotransformations====
Even if it is not a common substrate for metabolism, benzene can be oxidized by both [[bacteria]] and [[eukaryote]]s. In bacteria, [[dioxygenase]] enzyme can add an [[oxygen]] to the ring, and the unstable product is immediately reduced (by [[NADH]]) to a cyclic [[diol]] with two double bonds, breaking the aromaticity. Next, the diol is newly reduced by NADH to [[catechol]]. The catechol is then metabolized to [[acetyl CoA]] and [[succinyl CoA]], used by organisms mainly in the [[Krebs Cycle]] for energy production.

The pathway for the metabolism of benzene is complex and begins in the liver.  Several enzymes are involved.  These include [[cytochrome P450]] 2E1 (CYP2E1), quinine oxidoreductase (NQ01), GSH, and myeloperoxidase (MPO).  CYP2E1 is involved at multiple steps: converting benzene to [[oxepin]] (benzene oxide), [[phenol]] to [[hydroquinone]], and hydroquinone to both benzenetriol and [[catechol]].  Hydroquinone, benzenetriol and catechol are converted to polyphenols.  In the bone marrow, MPO converts these polyphenols to benzoquinones.  These intermediates and metabolites induce genotoxicity by multiple mechanisms including inhibition of topoisomerase II (which maintains chromosome structure), disruption of microtubules (which maintains cellular structure and organization), generation of oxygen free radicals (unstable species) that may lead to point mutations, increasing oxidative stress, inducing DNA strand breaks, and altering DNA methylation (which can affect gene expression).  NQ01 and GSH shift metabolism away from toxicity.  NQ01 metabolizes benzoquinone toward polyphenols (counteracting the effect of MPO).  GSH is involved with the formation of phenylmercapturic acid.&lt;ref name="Smith 2010 133–48"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snyder|first=R|author2=Hedli, C.C.|title=An overview of benzene metabolism|journal=Environ Health Perspect|year=1996|volume=104|pages=1165–1171|pmid=9118888|pmc=1469747|issue=Suppl 6|doi=10.1289/ehp.96104s61165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes may induce loss of function or gain of function.  For example, mutations in CYP2E1 increase activity and result in increased generation of toxic metabolites.  NQ01 mutations result in loss of function and may result in decreased detoxification.  Myeloperoxidase mutations result in loss of function and may result in decreased generation of toxic metabolites.  GSH mutations or deletions result in loss of function and result in decreased detoxification.  These genes may be targets for genetic screening for susceptibility to benzene toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dougherty|first=D|author2=Garte, S |author3=Barchowsky, A |author4=Zmuda, J |author5= Taioli, E |title=NQO1, MPO, CYP2E1, GSTT1 and STM1 polymorphisms and biological effects of benzene exposure—a literature review|journal=Toxicology Letters|year=2008|volume=182|pages=7–17|doi=10.1016/j.toxlet.2008.09.008|pmid=18848868|issue=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Molecular toxicology====
The paradigm of toxicological assessment of benzene is shifting towards the domain of molecular toxicology as it allows understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms in a better way. [[Glutathione]] seems to play an important role by protecting against benzene-induced DNA breaks and it is being identified as a new biomarker for exposure and effect.&lt;ref name=r3&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Fracasso ME, Doria D, Bartolucci GB, Carrieri M, Lovreglio P, Ballini A, Soleo L, Tranfo G, Manno M |volume=192|title=Low air levels of benzene: Correlation between biomarkers of exposure and genotoxic effects|journal=[[Toxicol Lett]]|pmid=19427373|doi=10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.04.028|year=2010|pages=22–8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzene causes chromosomal aberrations in the peripheral blood leukocytes and bone marrow explaining the higher incidence of leukemia and multiple myeloma caused by chronic exposure. These aberrations can be monitored using [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]] (FISH) with DNA probes to assess the effects of benzene along with the hematological tests as markers of hematotoxicity.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eastmond|first=D.A.|year=2000|last2=Rupa|first2=DS|last3=Hasegawa|first3=LS|title=Detection of hyperdiploidy and chromosome breakage in interphase human lymphocytes following exposure to the benzene metabolite hydroquinone using multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization with DNA probes|journal=Mutat Res|issue=1|volume=322| pages=9–20|pmid=7517507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzene metabolism involves enzymes coded for by polymorphic genes. Studies have shown that genotype at these loci may influence susceptibility to the toxic effects of benzene exposure. Individuals carrying variant of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX) and deletion of the glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) showed a greater frequency of DNA single-stranded breaks.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/15287390802349974|last=Garte|first=S|last2=Taioli|year=2000|first2=E|last3=Popov|first3=T|last4=Bolognesi|first4=C|last5=Farmer|first5=P|last6=Merlo|first6=F|title=Genetic susceptibility to benzene toxicity in humans|journal=J Toxicol Environ Health A|issue=22|volume=71|pages=1482–1489|pmid=18836923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biological oxidation and carcinogenic activity====
One way of understanding the carcinogenic effects of benzene is by examining the products of biological oxidation. Pure benzene, for example, oxidizes in the body to produce an epoxide, [[benzene oxide]], which is not excreted readily and can interact with DNA to produce harmful mutations.

===Routes of exposure===

====Inhalation====
Outdoor air may contain low levels of benzene from automobile service stations, wood smoke, tobacco smoke, the transfer of gasoline, exhaust from motor vehicles, and industrial emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts3.html#bookmark04 ToxFAQs for Benzene], Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Department of Health and Human Services {{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 50% of the entire nationwide (United States) exposure to benzene results from smoking tobacco or from exposure to tobacco smoke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxguides/toxguide-3.pdf?id=39&amp;tid=14 ToxGuide for Benzene], Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/ref&gt;  After smoking 32 cigarettes per day, the smoker would take in about 1.8 milligrams (mg) of benzene. This amount is about 10 times the average daily intake of benzene by nonsmokers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp3-c1-b.pdf Public Health Statement. Benzene], Division of Toxicology and Environmental Medicine, August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Inhaled benzene is primarily expelled unchanged through exhalation. In a human study 16.4 to 41.6% of retained benzene was eliminated through the lungs within five to seven hours after a two- to three-hour exposure to 47 to 110 ppm and only 0.07 to 0.2% of the remaining benzene was excreted unchanged in the urine. After exposure to 63 to 405&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 of benzene for 1 to 5 hours, 51 to 87% was excreted in the urine as phenol over a period of 23 to 50 hours. In another human study, 30% of absorbed dermally applied benzene, which is primarily metabolized in the liver, was excreted as phenol in the urine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+71-43-2 Benzene, CASRN: 71-43-2]. Hazardous Substances Data Bank, U.S. National Library of Medicine. National Institutes of Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exposure from soft drinks====
{{Main|Benzene in soft drinks}}
Under specific conditions and in the presence of other chemicals [[benzoic acid]] (a preservative) and [[ascorbic acid]] (Vitamin C) may interact to produce benzene. In March 2006, the official [[Food Standards Agency]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] conducted a survey of 150 brands of soft drinks. It found that four contained benzene levels above [[World Health Organization]] limits. The affected batches were removed from sale. Similar problems were reported by the FDA in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/19/health/main1638170.shtml "FDA: Too Much Benzene In Some Drinks"], ''CBS News'', May 19, 2006. Retrieved July 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contamination of water supply====
In 2005, the water supply to the city of [[Harbin]] in China with a population of almost nine million people, was cut off because of a major benzene exposure. Benzene leaked into the [[Songhua River]], which supplies drinking water to the city, after [[Jilin chemical plant explosions 2005|an explosion at a China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) factory]] in the city of Jilin on 13 November 2005.

'''William Griffith Wilson''' (November 26, 1895 – January 24, 1971), also known as '''Bill Wilson''' or '''Bill W.''', was the co-founder of  [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA). 

AA is an international  [[Social work with groups#Mutual aid|mutual aid]] fellowship with about 2 million members worldwide belonging to approximately 10,000 groups, associations, organizations, cooperatives, and fellowships of [[Alcoholism|alcoholics]] helping other alcoholics achieve and maintain [[sobriety]].&lt;ref&gt;"Alcoholics Anonymous" p XIX&lt;/ref&gt;  Following  [[Twelve Traditions|AA's Twelfth Tradition]] of anonymity, Wilson is commonly known as "Bill W." or "Bill." In order to communicate among one another, members of "AA" will often ask those who appear to be suffering or having a relapse from alcoholism if they are "friends with Bill". Although this question can be confusing, because "Bill" is a common name, it does provide a means of establishing a rapport with those who are familiar with the saying and in need of help. After Wilson's death in 1971, and amidst much controversy within the fellowship, his full name was included in obituaries by journalists who were unaware of the significance for maintaining anonymity within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=John|first=Stevens|title=Bill W. of Alcoholics Anonymous Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/26/archives/bill-w-of-alcoholics-anonymous-dies-bill-w-oi-alcoholics-anonymous.html|work=New York Times|publisher=The New Youk Times Company|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's sobriety from alcohol, which he maintained until his passing, began December 11, 1934. In 1955 Wilson turned over control of AA to a board of [[trustee]]s. Wilson died of [[emphysema]] complicated by pneumonia in 1971. In 1999 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' listed him as "Bill W.: The Healer" in the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601990614,00.html Heroes &amp; Icons of the 20th Century]. Time Magazine 153:(23) June 14, 1999. Retrieved 2012-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Wilson was born on November 26, 1895, in [[Dorset, Vermont|East Dorset, Vermont]], the son of Emily (née Griffith) and Gilman Barrows Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/wilson.html |title=Ancestry of "Bill W." |publisher=Wargs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born at his parents' home and business, the Mount Aeolus Inn and Tavern. His paternal grandfather, William C. Wilson, was also an alcoholic. William C. Wilson decided to stop drinking alcohol immediately after having a "religious experience" when he was under the influence of [[psilocybin]] {{#tag:ref|Synonyms and alternate spellings include: 4-PO-DMT (PO: [[phosphate]]; DMT: [[dimethyltryptamine]]), psilocybine, psilocibin, psilocybinum, psilotsibin, psilocin phosphate ester, and indocybin.&lt;ref name=Pubchem&gt;{{cite web |title=Psilocybine – Compound Summary |url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=10624 |publisher=[[PubChem]]. [[National Library of Medicine]] |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|aɪ|l|ə|ˈ|s|aɪ|b|ɪ|n}} {{respell|sy|lə|SY|bin}}) during a "soul searching" hike on [[Mount Aeolus (Vermont)|Mount Aeolus]].&lt;ref&gt;Cheever, p 25.&lt;/ref&gt; His grandson, Bill, also felt a very strong desire to stop drinking shortly after sharing a similar experience.

Both of Bill's parents abandoned him soon after he and his sister were born—his father never returned from a purported business trip, and his mother left Vermont to study [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medicine]]. Bill and his sister were raised by their maternal grandparents, Fayette and Ella Griffith. As a teen, Bill showed little interest in his academic studies and was rebellious. During a summer break in high school, he spent months designing and carving a [[boomerang]] to throw at birds, raccoons, and other local wildlife. After many difficult years during his early-mid teens, Bill became the captain of his high school's football team, and the principal violinist in its orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;"Pass It ON" pp. 32-34&lt;/ref&gt; Bill also dealt with a serious bout of depression at the age of seventeen, following the death of his first love, Bertha Bamford, who died of complications from surgery.&lt;ref name="Mel"&gt;{{cite book |last=B. |first=Mel |title=My Search For Bill W. |year=2000 |isbn=1-56838-374-6 |pages=5–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage, work, and alcoholism==

Wilson met his wife [[Lois W.|Lois Burnham]] during the summer of 1913, while sailing on Vermont's Emerald Lake; two years later the couple became engaged. He entered [[Norwich University]], but depression and panic attacks forced him to leave during his second semester. The next year he returned, but was soon suspended with a group of students involved in a hazing incident.&lt;ref name="Thomsen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomsen |first=Robert |title=Bill W. |year=1975 |isbn=0-06-014267-7  |pages=75, 96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because no one would take responsibility, and no one would identify the perpetrators, the entire class was punished.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The June 1916 [[Pancho Villa Expedition|incursion into the U.S. by Pancho Villa]] resulted in Wilson's class being mobilized as part of the [[Vermont National Guard]] and he was reinstated to serve.  The following year he was commissioned as an artillery officer. During military training in [[Massachusetts]], the young officers were often invited to dinner by the locals, and Wilson had his first drink, a glass of [[beer]], to little effect.&lt;ref&gt;Cheever, p 73.&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later at another dinner party, Wilson drank some [[Bronx (cocktail)|Bronx cocktails]], and felt at ease with the guests and liberated from his awkward shyness; "I had found the elixir of life," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;"Bill W.: from the rubble of a wasted life, he overcame alcoholism and founded the 12-step program that has helped millions of others do the same." (Time's "The Most Important People of the 20th Century".) Susan Cheever. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' 153.23 (June 14, 1999): p201+.&lt;/ref&gt; "Even that first evening I got thoroughly drunk, and within the next time or two I passed out completely. But as everyone drank hard, not too much was made of that."&lt;ref name="AAWS"&gt;Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (1984), ''"Pass it on": the story of Bill Wilson and how the A.A. message reached the world'',{{ISBN|0-916856-12-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson married Lois on January 24, 1918, just before he left to serve in [[World War I]] as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Coast Artillery.&lt;ref&gt;''Pass It On'' p 54.&lt;/ref&gt; After his military service, Wilson returned to live with his wife in New York. He failed to graduate from law school because he was too drunk to pick up his diploma.&lt;ref&gt;Cheever, 2004, p 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson became a stock [[Speculation|speculator]] and had success traveling the country with his wife, evaluating companies for potential investors. (During these trips Lois had a hidden agenda: she hoped the travel would keep Wilson from drinking.&lt;ref&gt;''Pass it on'' p 59.&lt;/ref&gt;) However, Wilson's constant drinking made business impossible and ruined his reputation.

In 1933 Wilson was committed to the [[Charles B. Towns]] Hospital for Drug and Alcohol Addictions in [[New York City]] four times under the care of [[William Duncan Silkworth|Dr. William D. Silkworth]]. Silkworth's theory was that alcoholism was a matter of both physical and mental control:  a [[Craving (withdrawal)|craving]], the manifestation of a physical [[allergy]] (the physical inability to stop drinking once started) and an obsession of the mind (to take the first drink).&lt;ref&gt;"Alcoholics Anonymous" p XXIII-XXVI&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson gained hope from Silkworth's assertion that alcoholism was a medical condition, but even that knowledge could not help him. He was eventually told that he would either die from his alcoholism or have to be locked up permanently due to ''[[Wernicke encephalopathy]]'' (commonly referred to as "wet brain").

==A spiritual program for recovery==
In November 1934, Wilson was visited by old drinking companion [[Ebby Thacher]]. Wilson was astounded to find that Thacher had been sober for several weeks under the guidance of the [[Evangelism|evangelical]] Christian [[Oxford Group]].&lt;ref&gt;''Pass it on'' p 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson took some interest in the group, but shortly after Thacher's visit, he was again admitted to Towns Hospital to recover from a bout of drinking. This was his fourth and last stay at Towns hospital under Doctor Silkworth's care and he showed signs of [[delirium tremens]].&lt;ref&gt;Alcoholics Anonymous "The Big Book"  4th edition  p.13&lt;/ref&gt; It was while undergoing treatment with [[Charles B. Towns|The Belladonna Cure]] that Wilson experienced his "Hot Flash" spiritual conversion and quit drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Pittman, Bill "AA the Way it Began p. 163-165&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that evening, Thacher had visited and tried to persuade him to turn himself over to the care of a Christian deity who would liberate him from alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/20/health/20drunk.html An Alcoholic’s Savior: God, Belladonna or Both?] New York Times, April 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilson, while lying in bed depressed and despairing, he cried out, "I'll do anything! Anything at all! If there be a God, let Him show Himself!"&lt;ref&gt;''Pass it on'' p 121.&lt;/ref&gt; He then had the sensation of a bright light, a feeling of ecstasy, and a new serenity. He never drank again for the remainder of his life. Wilson described his experience to Dr. Silkworth, who told him, "Something has happened to you I don't understand.  But you had better hang on to it".&lt;ref&gt;''Alcoholics Anonymous'' pg 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson joined the Oxford Group and tried to help other alcoholics, but succeeded only in keeping sober himself. During a failed business trip to [[Akron, Ohio]], Wilson was tempted to drink again and decided that to remain sober he needed to help another alcoholic. He called phone numbers in a church directory and eventually secured an introduction to [[Bob Smith (doctor)|Dr. Bob Smith]], an alcoholic Oxford Group member. Wilson explained Doctor Silkworth's theory that alcoholics suffer from a physical allergy and a mental obsession. Wilson shared that the only way he was able to stay sober was through having had a spiritual experience. Smith was familiar with the tenets of the Oxford Group and upon hearing Wilson's experience, "began to pursue the spiritual remedy for his malady with a willingness that he had never before been able to muster.  After a brief relapse, he sobered, never to drink again up to the moment of his death in 1950".&lt;ref&gt;''Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous'' p xvi&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson and Smith began working with other alcoholics. After that summer in Akron, Wilson returned to New York where he began having success helping alcoholics in what they called "a nameless squad of drunks" in an Oxford Group there.

In 1938, after about 100 alcoholics in Akron and New York had become sober, the fellowship decided to promote its program of recovery through the publication of a book, for which Wilson was chosen as primary author. The book was given the title ''Alcoholics Anonymous'' and included the list of suggested activities for spiritual growth known as the [[Twelve Steps]]. The movement itself took on the name of the book. Later Wilson also wrote the [[Twelve Traditions]], a set of spiritual guidelines to ensure the survival of individual AA groups. The AA general service conference of 1955 was a landmark event for Wilson in which he turned over the leadership of the maturing organization to an elected board.

In 1939, Wilson and [[Marty Mann]] visited High Watch Farm in Kent, CT. They would go on to found what is now [[High Watch Recovery Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=David |title=A Biography of Mrs. Marty Mann: The First Lady of Alcoholics Anonymous |date=2001 |publisher=Hazelden Publishing |location=Center City, MN |isbn=1-56838-626-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the world's first alcohol and addiction recovery center founded on Twelve Step principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Libov |first1=Charlotte |title=A model of self-reliance asks for help |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/15/nyregion/a-model-of-self-reliance-asks-for-help.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=April 15, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political beliefs==
Wilson strongly advocated that AA groups have not the "slightest reform of political complexion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The A.A. Service Manual Combined with Twelve Concepts for World Services |last=Wilson |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill W. |url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/en_bm-31.pdf |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lyPpMKt9?url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/en_bm-31.pdf |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, he wrote "No AA group or members should ever, in such a way as to implicate AA, express any opinion on outside controversial issues -- particularly those of politics, alcohol reform or sectarian religion. The Alcoholics Anonymous groups oppose no one. Concerning such matters they can express no views whatever. " Reworded, this became "Tradition 10" for AA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barefootsworld.net/aatraditions-gv1946.html |title=AA History - The 12 Traditions, AA Grapevine April, 1946 |publisher=Barefootsworld.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aa.org/en_pdfs/smf-122_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{details|History of Alcoholics Anonymous}}

==The final years==
During the last years of his life, Wilson rarely attended AA meetings to avoid being asked to speak as the co-founder rather than as an alcoholic.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael 2000, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; A heavy smoker, Wilson eventually suffered from [[emphysema]] and later [[pneumonia]]. He continued to smoke while dependent on an [[oxygen]] tank in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="Cheever, 2004, pp 245 - 247"&gt;Cheever, 2004, pp 245 - 247.&lt;/ref&gt;  He drank no alcohol for the final 37 years of his life;  however,  in the last days of his life he made demands for whiskey and became belligerent when refused.&lt;ref name="Cheever, 2004, pp 245 - 247"/&gt; During  this period, Wilson was visited by colleagues and friends who wanted to say goodbye. Wilson died of emphysema and pneumonia on January 24, 1971, en route to treatment in [[Miami, Florida]]. He is buried in [[Dorset, Vermont|East Dorset, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|2535|William G. "Bill" Wilson|accessdate=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temptation and reports of infidelity==
[[File:Stepping Stones, Katonah, NY.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stepping Stones (home)|Stepping Stones]], the Wilsons' home in later life, now a museum|alt=A brown house with low sloping black roof and dormer windows. There is a light snow covering on the brick and stone fountain and front lawn.]]
Though Wilson alluded to unfulfilled temptation in an account in the ''Alcoholics Anonymous'' "Big Book" ("There had been no real infidelity," he wrote, "for loyalty to my wife, helped at times by extreme drunkenness, kept me out of those scrapes."&lt;ref&gt;Alcoholics Anonymous World Services 1936, ''Alcoholics Anonymous'' 3rd Edition, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;), biographers Francis Hartigan, Matthew Raphael, and Susan Cheever cite claims that Wilson had sexual contacts outside of his marriage.

Francis Hartigan, AA biographer and personal secretary to Lois Wilson, in his book states that in the mid 1950s Bill began an affair with Helen Wynn, a woman 22 years his junior. Bill at one point discussed [[divorce|divorcing]] Lois to marry Helen. Bill eventually overcame the AA trustees' objections, and renegotiated his royalty agreements with them in 1963, which allowed him to include Helen Wynn in his estate. He left 10 percent of his book royalties to her and the other 90 percent to his wife Lois. In 1968, with Bill's illness making it harder for them to spend time together, Helen bought a house in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Franics Haritigan ''Bill W.''

Personal letters between Wilson and his wife Lois spanning a period of more than 60 years can be found in the archives at [[Stepping Stones (home)|Stepping Stones]], their former home in [[Katonah, New York]], and in AA's General Service Office archives in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Hartigan, ''Bill W.'', Chapter 25, p. 190-197 and p. 170-171, St. Martins Press, 2000, 1st edition, {{ISBN|0-312-20056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative cures and spiritualism==
In the 1950s Wilson used [[LSD]] in medically supervised experiments with [[Betty Eisner]], [[Gerald Heard]], and [[Aldous Huxley]]. With Wilson's invitation, his wife Lois, his spiritual adviser Father Ed Dowling, and Nell Wing also participated in experimentation of this drug. Later Wilson wrote to [[Carl Jung]], praising the results and recommending it as validation of Jung's spiritual experience. (The letter was not in fact sent as Jung had died.)&lt;ref&gt;Francis Hartigan ''Bill Wilson'' p. 177-179.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilson, the session allowed him to re-experience a spontaneous spiritual experience he had had years before, which had enabled him to overcome his own alcoholism.

Bill was enthusiastic about his experience; he felt it helped him eliminate many barriers erected by the self, or ego, that stand in the way of one's direct experience of the cosmos and of God. He thought he might have found something that could make a big difference to the lives of many who still suffered. Bill is quoted as saying: "It is a generally acknowledged fact in spiritual development that ego reduction makes the influx of God's grace possible. If, therefore, under LSD   we can have a temporary reduction, so that we can better see what we are and where we are going — well, that might be of some help. The goal might become clearer. So I consider LSD to be of some value to some people, and practically no damage to anyone. It will never take the place of any of the existing means by which we can reduce the ego, and keep it reduced."&lt;ref&gt;Pass It On': The Story of Bill Wilson and How the A. A. Message Reached the World. p. 370-371.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson felt that regular usage of LSD in a carefully controlled, structured setting would be beneficial for many recovering [[alcoholics]]. However, he felt this method only should be attempted by individuals with well-developed [[super-ego]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Wilson "The Best of Bill: Reflections on Faith, Fear, Honesty, Humility, and Love" p. 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 Wilson wrote a letter to Heard saying: "I am certain that the LSD experiment has helped me very much. I find myself with a heightened colour perception and an appreciation of beauty almost destroyed by my years of depressions." Most AAs were strongly opposed to his experimenting with a mind-altering substance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/23/lsd-help-alcoholics-theory LSD could help alcoholics stop drinking, AA founder believed] The Guardian, 23 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson met [[Abram Hoffer]] and learned about the potential mood-stabilizing effects of [[niacin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctoryourself.com/Hoffer2009int.pdf|title=An Interview with Abram Hoffer], by [[Andrew W. Saul (nutrition specialist)-Andrew W. Saul]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was impressed with experiments indicating that alcoholics who were given niacin had a better sobriety rate, and he began to see niacin "as completing the third leg in the stool, the physical to complement the spiritual and emotional." Wilson also believed that niacin had given him relief from depression, and he promoted the vitamin within the AA community and with the National Institute of Mental Health as a treatment for schizophrenia. However, Wilson created a major furor in AA because he used the AA office and letterhead in his promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Hartigan ''Bill W'' P.205-208&lt;/ref&gt;

For Wilson, [[spiritualism]] was a lifelong interest. One of his letters to adviser Father Dowling suggests that while Wilson was working on his book ''[[Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions]]'', he felt that spirits were helping him, in particular a 15th-century monk named Boniface.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fitzgerald. ''The Soul of Sponsorship: The Friendship of Fr. Ed Dowling, S.J. and Bill Wilson in Letters.'' Hazelden Publishing &amp; Educational Services: 1995. {{ISBN|978-1-56838-084-1}}. p 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his conviction that he had evidence for the reality of the spirit world, Wilson chose not to share this with AA. However, his practices still created controversy within the AA membership. Wilson and his wife continued with their unusual practices in spite of the misgivings of many AA members. In their house they had a "spook room" where they would invite guests to participate in [[seances]] using a [[Ouija]] board.&lt;ref&gt;Harigan, Francis, Bill W.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Kurtz. ''Not-God: A History of Alcoholics Anonymous.'' Hazelden Educational Foundation, Center City, MN, 1979. p 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson has often been described as having loved being the center of attention, but after the AA principle of anonymity had become established, he refused an honorary degree from [[Yale University]] and refused to allow his picture, even from the back, on the cover of ''Time''. Wilson's persistence, his ability to take and use good ideas, and his entrepreneurial flair&lt;ref&gt;Griffith Edwards. ''Alcohol: The World's Favorite Drug''. 1st U.S. ed. New York : Thomas Dunne Books, 2002. {{ISBN|0-312-28387-3}}. p 109.&lt;/ref&gt; are revealed in his pioneering escape from an alcoholic "death sentence," his central role in the development of a program of spiritual growth, and his leadership in creating and building AA, "an independent, entrepreneurial, maddeningly democratic, non-profit organization."&lt;ref&gt;Are we making the most of Alcoholics Anonymous? Peter Armstrong. ''The Journal of Addiction and Mental Health'' 5.1, Jan-Feb 2002. p16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson is perhaps best known as a synthesizer of ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Cheever, 2004, p 122.&lt;/ref&gt; the man who pulled together various threads of psychology, theology, and democracy into a workable and life-saving system. Aldous Huxley called him "the greatest social architect of our century,"&lt;ref&gt;Cheever, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] named Wilson to their ''Time 100 List of The Most Important People of the 20th Century''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/time100/heroes/profile/wilson01_OLD.html Time 100 Most Important] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320022729/http://www.time.com/time/time100/heroes/profile/wilson01_OLD.html |date=March 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's self-description was a man who, "because of his bitter experience, discovered, slowly and through a conversion experience, a system of behavior and a series of actions that work for alcoholics who want to stop drinking."

Biographer Susan Cheever wrote in ''My Name Is Bill'', "Bill Wilson never held himself up as a model: he only hoped to help other people by sharing his own experience, strength and hope. He insisted again and again that he was just an ordinary man".

Wilson bought a house that he and Lois called [[Stepping Stones (home)|Stepping Stones]] on an {{convert|8|acre|0|adj=on}} estate in [[Bedford Hills, New York]], in 1941, and he lived there with Lois until he died in 1971. After Lois died in 1988, the house was opened for tours and is now on the [[National Register of Historic Places]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/06/nyregion/06aa.html Alcoholics Anonymous Founder’s House Is a Self-Help Landmark]. ''New York Times''. July 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; it was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Interior Designates 27 New National Landmarks |url=http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/Interior-Designates-27-New-National-Landmarks.cfm |publisher=[[U.S. Department of the Interior]] |date=October 17, 2012 |accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Over the years, Bill W., the formation of AA and also his wife Lois have been the subject of numerous projects, starting with ''[[My Name Is Bill W.]]'', a 1989 CBS [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]] TV movie starring [[James Woods]] as Bill W. and [[James Garner]] as Dr. Bob. Woods won an [[Emmy]] for his portrayal of Wilson. He was also depicted in a 2010 TV movie based on Lois' life, ''[[When Love Is Not Enough: The Lois Wilson Story]]'', adapted from a 2005 book of the same name written by [[William G. Borchert]]. The film starred [[Winona Ryder]] as Lois Wilson and [[Barry Pepper]] as Bill W.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=1547035|title=When Love Is Not Enough: The Lois Wilson Story }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 documentary, ''[[Bill W. (film)|Bill W.]]'', was directed by Dan Carracino and Kevin Hanlon.&lt;ref name="LAT-BillW"&gt;{{cite news |title='Bill W.' cuts through the anonymity|first=Sheri |last=Linden|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-bill-w-capsule-20120518,0,3940309.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles|date=18 May 2012 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=30 May 2013|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band [[Dream Theater]] dedicated each song of their ''[[Twelve-step Suite]]'' to Bill W.

In season five, episode one, of ''[[The Sopranos]]'', Chris Moltisanti is seen reading  ''My Search for Bill W.''

Season 3 of [[Mystery Science Theater 3000]] included Bill W. in the "Special Thanks" section of the end credits.

The band [[El Ten Eleven]]'s song "Thanks Bill" is dedicated to Bill W. since lead singer Kristian Dunn's wife got sober due to AA. He states "If she hadn't gotten sober we probably wouldn't be together, so that's my thank you to Bill Wilson who invented AA". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slAgMrjXcHs|title=El Ten Eleven "Thanks Bill" At: Guitar Center|first=|last=Guitar Center|date=4 February 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Michael Graubart's Sober Songs Vol. 1, the song "Hey, Hey, AA" references Bill's encounter with Ebby Thatcher which started him on the path to recovery and eventually the creation of Alcoholics Anonymous. The lyric reads, "Ebby T. comes strolling in.  Bill says, 'Fine, you're a friend of mine.  Don't mind if I drink my gin.'"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24964">'''Biological value''' ('''BV''') is a measure of the proportion of absorbed [[protein]] from a food which becomes incorporated into the proteins of the organism's body. It captures how readily the digested protein can be used in [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] in the [[cell (biology)|cells]] of the organism. Proteins are the major source of [[nitrogen]] in food. BV assumes protein is the only source of nitrogen and measures the proportion of this nitrogen absorbed by the body which is then excreted. The remainder must have been incorporated into the proteins of the organisms body. A [[ratio]] of nitrogen incorporated into the body over nitrogen absorbed gives a measure of protein "usability" – the BV.

Unlike some measures of protein usability, biological value does not take into account how readily the protein can be [[digestion|digested]] and absorbed (largely by the [[small intestine]]). This is reflected in the experimental methods used to determine BV.

BV uses two similar scales:
#The true percentage utilization (usually shown with a percent symbol).
#The percentage utilization relative to a readily utilizable protein source, often [[Egg (food)|egg]] (usually shown as unitless).
These two values will be similar but not identical.

The BV of a food varies greatly, and depends on a wide variety of factors. In particular the BV value of a food varies depending on its preparation and the recent diet of the organism. This makes reliable determination of BV difficult and of limited use — fasting prior to testing is universally required in order to ascertain reliable figures.

BV is commonly used in nutrition science in many [[Mammals|mammalian organisms]], and is a relevant measure in humans.&lt;ref name=Methodology&gt;Thomas, K. Über die biologische Wertigkeit der stickstoff-substanzen in 1909 verschiedenen Nahrungsmitteln. Arch. Physiol., 219.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a popular guideline in [[bodybuilding]] in protein choice.&lt;ref name=Researchers&gt;Optimum Sports Nutrition: Your Competitive Edge, A Complete Nutritional Guide For Optimizing Athletic Performance; Chapter 12. by Dr. Michael Colgan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afpafitness.com/articles/articles-and-newletters/research-articles-index/nutrition-wellness/animal-vs-vegetable-protein-debate-what-is-the-best-protein-for-muscle-growth/ The Great Animal Versus Vegetable Protein Debate What Is The Best Protein For Muscle Growth?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determination of BV==
For accurate determination of BV:&lt;ref name="Mitchell 1923"&gt;Mitchell, H.H. (1923). ''"[http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/58/3/873.pdf A Method of Determining the Biological Value of Protein]"''. Journal of Biol. Chem. 58 (3): 873.&lt;/ref&gt;
#the test organism must only consume the protein or mixture of proteins of interest (the test diet).
#the test diet must contain no non-protein sources of nitrogen.
#the test diet must be of suitable content and quantity to avoid use of the protein primarily as an energy source.
These conditions mean the tests are typically carried out over the course of over one week with strict diet control. Fasting prior to testing helps produce consistency between subjects (it removes recent diet as a variable).

There are two scales on which BV is measured; percentage utilization and relative utilization. By convention percentage BV has a percent sign (%) suffix and relative BV has no unit.

===Percentage utilization===
Biological value is determined based on this formula.&lt;ref name="Mitchell 1923" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chick H., Roscoe, M.H. (1930). ''"[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1254795&amp;blobtype=pdf The biological values of proteins: A method for measuring the nitrogenous exchange of rats for the purpose of determining the biological value of proteins]"''. Biochem J. 24 (6): 1780-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

:BV = ( ''N&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' / ''N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) * 100
Where:
:''N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = nitrogen absorbed in proteins on the test diet
:''N&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' = nitrogen incorporated into the body on the test diet

However direct measurement of ''N&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is essentially impossible. It will typically be measured indirectly from nitrogen excretion in [[urine]].&lt;ref&gt;Fixsen, M.A.B. ''"[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1254798&amp;blobtype=pdf The biological value of purified caseinogen and the influence of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upon biological values, determined by the balance sheet method]"''. Biochem J. 1930; 24(6): 1794–1804.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faeces|Faecal]] excretion of nitrogen must also be taken into account - this part of the ingested protein is not absorbed by the body and so not included in the calculation of BV.  An estimate is used of the amount of the urinary and faecal nitrogen excretion not coming from ingested nitrogen.  This may be done by substituting a protein-free diet and observing nitrogen excretion in urine or faeces, but the accuracy of this method of estimation of the amount of nitrogen excretion not coming from ingested nitrogen on a protein-containing diet has been questioned.
:BV = ( ( ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(f)&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(u)&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) / (''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(f)&lt;/sub&gt;'') ) * 100
Where:
:''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = nitrogen intake in proteins on the test diet
:''N&lt;sub&gt;e(f)&lt;/sub&gt;'' =  (nitrogen excreted in faeces whilst on the test diet) - (nitrogen excreted in faeces not from ingested nitrogen)
:''N&lt;sub&gt;e(u)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = (nitrogen excreted in urine whilst on the test diet) - (nitrogen excreted in urine not from ingested nitrogen)

Note:
:''N&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(f)&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(u)&lt;/sub&gt;''
:''N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''  = ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(f)&lt;/sub&gt;''

This can take any value from 0 to 100, though reported BV could be out of this range if the estimates of nitrogen excretion from non-ingested sources are inaccurate, such as could happen if the endogenous secretion changes with protein intake. A BV of 100% indicates complete utilization of a dietary protein, i.e. 100% of the protein ingested and absorbed is incorporated into proteins into the body.  The value of 100% is an absolute maximum, no more than 100% of the protein ingested can be utilized (in the equation above ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(u)&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(f)&lt;/sub&gt;'' cannot go negative, setting 100% as the maximum BV).

===Relative utilization===

Due to experimental limitations BV is often measured ''relative'' to an easily utilizable protein. Normally [[Egg (food)|egg]] protein is assumed to be the most readily utilizable protein and given a BV of 100. For example:

Two tests of BV are carried out on the same person; one with the test protein source and one with a reference protein (egg protein).
:relative BV = ( ''BV&lt;sub&gt;(test)&lt;/sub&gt;'' / ''BV&lt;sub&gt;(egg)&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) * 100
Where:
:''BV&lt;sub&gt;(test)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = percentage BV of the test diet for that individual
:''BV&lt;sub&gt;(egg)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = percentage BV of the reference (egg) diet for that individual

This is not restricted to values of less than 100. The percentage BV of egg protein is only 93.7% which allows other proteins with true percentage BV between 93.7% and 100% to take a relative BV of over 100. For example, [[whey protein]] takes a relative BV of 104, while its percentage BV is under 100%.

The principal advantage of measuring BV relative to another protein diet is accuracy; it helps account for some of the metabolic variability between individuals. In a simplistic sense the egg diet is testing the maximum efficiency the individual can take up protein, the BV is then provided as a percentage taking this as the maximum.

===Conversion===

Providing it is known which protein measurements were made relative to it is simple to convert from relative BV to percentage BV:
:''BV&lt;sub&gt;(relative)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ( ''BV&lt;sub&gt;(percentage)&lt;/sub&gt;'' / ''BV&lt;sub&gt;(reference)&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) * 100
:''BV&lt;sub&gt;(percentage)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ( ''BV&lt;sub&gt;(relative)&lt;/sub&gt;'' / 100 ) * ''BV&lt;sub&gt;(reference)&lt;/sub&gt;''
Where:
:''BV&lt;sub&gt;(relative)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = relative BV of the test protein
:''BV&lt;sub&gt;(reference)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = percentage BV of reference protein (typically egg: 93.7%).
:''BV&lt;sub&gt;(percentage)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = percentage BV of the test protein

While this conversion is simple it is not strictly valid due to the differences between the experimental methods. It is, however, suitable for use as a guideline.

==Factors that affect BV==
The determination of BV is carefully designed to accurately measure some aspects of protein usage whilst eliminating variation from other aspects. When using the test (or considering BV values) care must be taken to ensure the variable of interest is quantified by BV. Factors which affect BV can be grouped into properties of the protein source and properties of the species or individual consuming the protein.

===Properties of the protein source===
Three major properties of a protein source affect its BV:
*Amino acid composition, and the limiting amino acid, which is usually lysine
*Preparation (cooking)
*Vitamin and mineral content

Amino acid composition is the principal effect. All proteins are made up of combinations of the 21 biological amino acids. Some of these can be synthesised or converted in the body, whereas others cannot and must be ingested in the diet. These are known as essential amino acids (EAAs), of which there are 9 in humans. The number of EAAs varies according to species (see below).

EAAs missing from the diet prevent the synthesis of proteins that require them. If a protein source is missing critical EAAs, then its biological value will be low as the missing EAAs form a bottleneck in protein synthesis. For example, if a hypothetical muscle protein requires [[phenylalanine]] (an essential amino acid), then this must be provided in the diet for the muscle protein to be produced. If the current protein source in the diet has no phenylalanine in it the muscle protein cannot be produced, giving a low usability and BV of the protein source.

In a related way if amino acids are missing from the protein source which are particularly slow or energy consuming to synthesise this can result in a low BV.

Methods of food preparation also affect the availability of amino acids in a food source. Some of food preparation may damage or destroy some EAAs, reducing the BV of the protein source.

Many vitamins and minerals are vital for the correct function of cells in the test organism. If critical minerals or vitamins are missing from the protein source this can result in a massively lowered BV. Many BV tests artificially add vitamins and minerals (for example in [[yeast]] extract) to prevent this.

===Properties of the test species or individual===

====Under test conditions====
Variations in BV under test conditions are dominated by the [[metabolism]] of the individuals or species being tested. In particular differences in the essential amino acids (EAAs) species to species has a significant effect, although even minor variations in amino acid metabolism individual to individual have a large effect.

The fine dependence on the individual's metabolism makes measurement of BV a vital tool in diagnosing some [[metabolic diseases]].

====In everyday life====
The principal effect on BV in everyday life is the organism's current diet, although many other factors such as age, health, weight, sex, etc. all have an effect. In short any condition which can affect the organism's metabolism will vary the BV of a protein source.

In particular, whilst on a high protein diet the BV of all foods consumed is reduced — the limiting rate at which the amino acids may be incorporated into the body is not the availability of amino acids but the rate of protein synthesis possible in cells. This is a major point of criticism of BV as a test; the test diet is artificially protein rich and may have unusual effects.

===Factors with no effect===
BV is designed to ignore variation in digestibility of a food — which in turn largely depends on the food preparation. For example, compare raw soy beans and extracted soy bean protein. The raw soy beans, with tough [[cell wall]]s protecting the protein, have a far lower digestibility than the purified, unprotected, soy bean protein extract. As a foodstuff far more protein can be absorbed from the extract than the raw beans, however the BV will be the same.

The exclusion of digestibility is a point of misunderstanding and leads to misrepresentation of the meaning of a high or low BV

==Advantages and disadvantages==
BV provides a good measure of the usability of proteins in a diet and also plays a valuable role in detection of some metabolic diseases. BV is, however, a scientific variable determined under very strict and unnatural conditions. It is not a test designed to evaluate the usability of proteins whilst an organism is in everyday life — indeed the BV of a diet will vary greatly depending on age, weight, health, sex, recent diet, current metabolism, etc. of the organism. In addition BV of the same food varies significantly species to species. Given these limitations BV is still relevant to everyday diet to some extent. No matter the individual or their conditions a protein source with high BV, such as egg, will always be more easily used than a protein source with low BV.

===In comparison to other methods known===
There are many other major methods of determining how readily used a protein is, including:
*[[Net protein utilization|Net protein Utilization]] (NPU)
*[[Protein efficiency ratio|Protein Efficiency Ratio]] (PER)
*[[Nitrogen balance|Nitrogen Balance]] (NB)
*[[Protein digestibility]] (PD)
*[[Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score]] (PDCAAS)
These all hold specific advantages and disadvantages over BV,&lt;ref name=Proteins&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/M2835E/M2835E00.HTM |title=The Use Of Biological Value Of A Protein In Evaluating Its Quality For Human Requirements| author=S.G.

==In animals==
The Biological Value method is also used for analysis in animals such as cattle, poultry, and various laboratory animals such as rats. It was used by the poultry industry to determine which mixtures of feed were utilized most efficiently by developing chicken.
Although the process remains the same, the biological values of particular proteins in humans differs from their biological values in animals due to physiological variations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/U5900t/u5900t07.htm Recent developments in protein quality evaluation by Dr E.

==Criticism==
Since the method measures only the amount that is retained in the body critics have pointed out what they perceive as a weakness of the biological value [[methodology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/M2835E/M2835E00.HTM Joint FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation on Energy and Protein Requirements, ''The use of biological value of protein in evaluatiing its quality for human requirements'', S.G. Srikantia, University of Mysore].&lt;/ref&gt; 
Critics have pointed to research that indicates that because whey protein isolate is digested so quickly it may in fact enter the bloodstream and be converted into carbohydrates through a process called [[gluconeogenesis]] much more rapidly than was previously thought possible, so while amino acid concentrations increased with whey it was discovered that oxidation rates also increased and a steady-state metabolism, a process where there is no change in overall protein balance, is created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.t-nation.com/readTopic.do?id=462192 Testosterone Nation, The ''Protein Roundtable'', August 24, 2000].&lt;/ref&gt;  They claim that when the human body consumes whey protein it is absorbed so rapidly that most of it is sent to the [[liver]] for [[oxidation]].  Hence they believe the reason so much is retained is that it is used for energy production, not [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]]. This would bring into question whether the method defines which [[protein]]s are more biologically utilizable.

A further critique published in the ''Journal of Sports Science and Medicine'' states that the BV of a protein does not take into consideration several key factors that influence the digestion and interaction of protein with other foods before absorption, and that it only measures a protein's maximal potential quality and not its estimate at requirement levels.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Sports Science and Medicine (2004) 3, 118-130&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the study by Poullain et al., which is often cited to demonstrate the superiority of whey protein hydrolysate by marketers, measured nitrogen balance in rats after three days of starvation, which corresponds to a longer period in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Poullain, MG et al. Effect of whey proteins, their oligopeptide hydrosylates and free amino acid mixtures on growth and nitrogen retention in fed and starved rats. J Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (1989) 13: 382-386&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that whey protein hydrolysate led to better nitrogen retention and growth than the other proteins studied. However the study's flaw is in the BV method used, as starvation affects how well the body will store incoming protein (as does a very high caloric intake), leading to falsely elevated BV measures.&lt;ref name=Pellett&gt;Pellett, PL and Young, VR. Nutritional evaluation of protein foods. United Nations University, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

So, the BV of a protein is related to the amount of protein given. BV is measured at levels below the maintenance level. This means that as protein intake goes up, the BV of that protein goes down. For example, milk protein shows a BV near 100 at intakes of 0.2 g/kg. As protein intake increases to roughly maintenance levels, 0.5 g/kg, BV drops only around 70.&lt;ref name="Pellett"/&gt;  Pellet et al., concluded that "biological measures of protein quality conducted at suboptimal levels in either experimental animals or human subjects may overestimate protein value at maintenance levels." As a result, while BV may be important for rating proteins where intake is below requirements, it has little bearing on individuals with protein intakes far above requirements.

This flaw is supported by the FAO/WHO/UNU, who state that BV and NPU are measured when the protein content of the diet is clearly below that of requirement, deliberately done to maximize existing differences in quality as inadequate energy intake lowers the efficiency of protein utilization and in most N balance studies, calorie adequacy is ensured. And because no population derives all of its protein exclusively from a single food, the determination of BV of a single protein is of limited use for application to human protein requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/M2835E/M2835E00.HTM The Use Of Biological Value Of A Protein In Evaluating Its Quality For Human Requirements.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another limitation of the use of Biological Value as a measure of protein quality is that proteins which are completely devoid of one [[essential amino acids|essential amino acid]] (EAA) can still have a BV of up to 40.  This is because of the ability of organisms to conserve and recycle EAAs as an adaptation of inadequate intake of the amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;Said, A.K. and [[D. Mark Hegsted|Hegsted, D.M.]], J. Nutr., 99, 474, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, the use of rats for the determination of protein quality is not ideal. Rats differ from humans in requirements of essential amino acids. This has led to a general criticism that experiments on rats lead to an over-estimation of the BV of high-quality proteins to man because human requirements of essential amino acids are much lower than those for rats (as rats grow at a much faster rate than humans). Also, because of their fur, rats are assumed to have relatively high
requirements of sulphur-containing amino acids (methionine and cysteine).

As a result, the analytical method that is universally recognized by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), [[United Nations University]] (UNU) and the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] when judging the quality of protein in the human is not PER or BV but the Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score ([[PDCAAS]]), as it is viewed as accurately measuring the correct relative nutritional value of animal and vegetable sources of protein in the diet.&lt;ref&gt;FAO/WHO (1991) Protein Quality Evaluation Report of Joint FAO/WHO Expert
Consultation, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, FAO Food
and Nutrition Paper No. 51, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaafsma, G. (2000) 'The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score. ''Journal of Nutrition'' 130, 1865S-1867S&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bissorte Dam''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Barrage de Bissorte'') is a [[gravity dam]] in the [[Maurienne|Maurienne Valley]], in [[Savoie]], [[France]], about {{Convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Valmeinier]]. It was built from 1930 to 1935 to supply a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric plant]] capable of generating 75 [[megawatts]] (MW) of power.

The complex was reconfigured from 1980 to 1986 in order to add a 750 MW [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] [[power station|power plant]] known as ''Super-Bissorte'', the third most powerful in France after [[Grand'Maison Dam|Grand'Maison]] and [[Montézic Power Station|Montézic]].

==Location==

The Bissorte Dam is perched on an ancient [[glacial landform|glacial basin]], now [[alpine tundra]], in the [[Massif des Cerces]]. It is close to the Valfréjus ski resort in the [[Communes of France|commune]] of [[Modane]], near the [[Italy|Italian]] border.

==History==

During the 1920s, a period of intense stock market [[speculation]] on hydroelectricity in France, Bissorte's potential as a building site drew much attention. In 1930, work began on the construction of a {{convert|545|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=mid|-long}} gravity dam with a stone facing to protect its [[concrete]] structure. The power plant, known today as ''Bissorte 1'', was put into operation in 1935 and can output 75 MW in a matter of minutes thanks to its three [[Pelton wheel|Pelton turbines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energie.edf.com/fichiers/fckeditor/Commun/En_Direct_Centrales/Hydraulique/Centres/Les_Alpes/publications/documents/bissorte%20corrigee.pdf |title=Aménagement de Bissorte et Super Bissorte |publisher=[[Électricité de France|EDF]] |accessdate=27 January 2015 |language=French |trans-title=Bissorte and Super Bissorte Complex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the [[electric utility]] company [[Électricité de France]] (EDF, Electricity of France) built a second dam, the Pont des Chèvres, on the [[Arc (Savoie)|Arc River]] below Bissorte and reorganized the power plant into a pumped-storage facility. Through the use of a new underground [[penstock]], water that had been released through the [[turbines]] during times of [[peak demand|peak energy demand]] would be pumped from the lower [[reservoir]] back into the upper one during times of lower consumption, replenishing the plant's supply of water and enabling a balanced production of power. Super-Bissorte, the new addition to the complex, was commissioned in 1986. It comprises two underground facilities, called ''Bissorte 2'' and ''Bissorte 3'', which can generate 750 MW through the use of four 150 MW reversible [[Francis turbine|Francis pump-turbines]] and a 150 MW Pelton turbine.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bissorte [[Concession (contract)|concession agreement]], which grants EDF the rights to operate the facility, expired at the end of 2014 and will be put up for bid, according to the Law of 16 Octobre 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/La-mise-en-concurrence-des.html |title=La mise en concurrence des concessions hydroélectriques|publisher=[[Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy]] |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=27 January 2015 |language=French |trans-title=Open Bidding on Hydroelectric Concession Agreements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

The Bissorte Dam, which forms the upper reservoir ({{convert|2050|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} elevation), is a gravity dam on the Bissorte River ({{convert|8.8|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} long).&lt;ref&gt;{{Sandre|id=W1030620|Ruisseau de Bissorte|consulté le=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is {{convert|545|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} long and {{convert|49|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} wide at the base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hydrelect.info/articles.php?lng=fr&amp;pg=601 |title=Vallée de l'Arc - la Maurienne |website=Hydrelect |date=2 April 2014 |accessdate=27 January 2015 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stone facing protects its concrete structure. The reservoir, Lake Bissorte (''Lac de Bissorte''), holds a water volume of {{Convert|40,000,000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} that can now be brought to a maximum of {{Convert|100,000,000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} after additional work was completed in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;EDF, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second reservoir, situated on the Arc River downstream from the Bissorte Dam, is formed by the Pont des Chèvres Dam ({{convert|925|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} elevation), a gate-structure dam. It serves to stabilize the flow of [[tailwater]] from the Bissorte and Orelle plants, and functions as the lower reservoir in the pumped-storage system utilized by Super-Bissorte, one of France's major pumped-storage power stations, known as STEP (''Stations de transfert d'énergie par pompage''). The reservoir holds {{Convert|1,500,000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} of water.&lt;ref&gt;Hydrelect, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penstocks==

The original [[penstock]], installed to pipe water into Bissorte 1, was a novelty at the time of its construction thanks to its stiffener rings, metal bands that provide reinforcement against the high [[Tension (physics)|tensile]] pressure of the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savoie-archives.fr/archives73/dossiers_sabaudia/barrages/public4.php |title=Grands barrages des Alpes de Savoie |last=Messiez |first=Maurice |accessdate=27 January 2015 |language=French |trans-title=Great Dams of the Savoie Alps}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second penstock was installed underground with the addition of Super-Bissorte.

==Hydroelectric plants==

Bissorte 1 is equipped with three horizontal [[Pelton wheel|Pelton turbines]] that can output 25 MW each. It is {{convert|1144|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} below the water level of Lake Bissorte.

Super-Bissorte is composed of two underground facilities: Bissorte 2, outfitted with four 150 MW reversible [[Francis turbine|Francis pump-turbines]], and Bissorte 3, furnished with a 150 MW vertical Pelton turbine.&lt;ref&gt;Hydrelect, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pumped-storage system==

Super-Bissorte, like the other STEP facilities, is a strategic element of France's [[power grid]]. It provides a way to restore electricity in case of a [[power outage]], like the one that occurred during the [[2006 European blackout|Europe-wide blackout]] on November 6, 2006. Due to an error of judgement on the part of a German electric company, French and Spanish power networks found themselves in abrupt isolation and unable to meet demand. However, the [[Réseau de Transport d'Électricité]] (RTE, Electricity Transmission Network) was able to offset the shortage by mobilizing nine hydroelectric dams: “At 22:15 hours, the hydroelectric plants of Bort, Montézic, Grand Maison, Villarodin, and Sarran-Bromat augmented production by 2,800 MW, followed by an increase of 1,140 MW at 22:20 hours from the Tignes, Super-Bissorte, La Bathie and Monteynard plants.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://217.74.102.86/article/print?aid=521 |title=La panne électrique du 4 novembre 2006 : questions réponses |others=Author's trans. |date=20 November 2006 |accessdate=27 January 2015 |language=French| publisher=[[Réseau de Transport d'Électricité|RTE]] |trans-title=The November 4, 2006 Blackout: Questions and Answers| quote=A 22h15, la production des usines hydroélectriques de Bort, Montézic, Grand Maison, Villarodin, Sarran-Bromat augmentait de 2 800 MW, suivie à 22h20 par 1 140 MW venant de Tignes, Super-Bissorte, La Bathie et Monteynard.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breast hematoma'''  is a collection of blood within the [[breast]]. It arises from internal bleeding ([[hemorrhage]]) and may arise due to trauma (breast injury or [[Breast surgery|surgery]]) or due to a non-traumatic cause.

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms may include visible discoloring ([[ecchymosis]]), breast pain, and swelling.

The symptoms may be similar to those of [[fibrocystic breast changes]].

== Causes ==
A breast hematoma may appear due to direct trauma to the breast, for example from a sports injury or a road accident, for example a vehicle collision in which a seat belt injury occurs.

Hematoma can also be a consequence of breast surgery, usually due to post-operative bleeding. Bleeding may occur shortly after the intervention or a number of days later and can occur for cosmetic surgery (for example [[breast reduction]] or [[breast enhancement]]) and for non-cosmetic surgery (for example [[Lymphadenectomy|lymph node removal]], [[lumpectomy]], or [[mastectomy]]). More rarely, hematoma can result from [[breast biopsy]].

Rarely, a breast hematoma can also occur spontaneously due to a rupture of blood vessels in the breast, especially in persons with [[coagulopathy]]&lt;ref name="radiopaedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiopaedia.org/articles/breast-haematoma|title=Breast hematoma|publisher=radiopaedia.org|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salemis NS |title=Breast hematoma complicating anticoagulant therapy: management and literature review |journal=Breast Disease |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=25–8 |year=2012 |pmid=23507668 |doi=10.3233/BD-130344 |type=review}}&lt;/ref&gt; or after long-term use of blood-thinning drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen.&lt;ref name="Sabel2009-p177"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael S. Sabel|title=Essentials of Breast Surgery: A Volume in the Surgical Foundations Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lFxf2HYnS4C&amp;pg=PA177|date=23 April 2009|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-323-07464-2|pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
When there is post-operative swelling after [[breast surgery]] or core needle biopsy, a [[breast ultrasound]] examination may be indicated in order to differentiate between a hematoma and other possible post-surgical complications such as [[Breast abscess|abscess]] or [[seroma]],&lt;ref name="SohnBlohmer1999-p98"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christof Sohn|author2=Jens-U. Blohmer|author3=Ulrike Hamper|title=Breast Ultrasound: A Systematic Approach to Technique and Image Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEu_WNtAueUC&amp;pg=PA98|year=1999|publisher=Thieme|isbn=978-3-13-111531-7|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent hematoma is usually visible in a [[mammogram]].&lt;ref name="radiopaedia"/&gt; and it also shows typical signal intensities on [[magnetic resonance imaging|MR imaging]].&lt;ref name="Brinck2004-p99"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ulrich Brinck|title=Practical MR Mammography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-VJfeksHJ7QC&amp;pg=PA99|date=January 2004|publisher=Thieme|isbn=978-3-13-132031-5|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a differentiation from breast cancer is necessary, a hematoma biopsy may be indicated.

A careful consideration of the [[case history]] is important for the diagnosis of a breast hematoma.

== Pathophysiology ==
Small breast hematomas often resolve on their own within several days or weeks by means of reabsorption of the blood. Larger hematomas are more likely to lead to inflammation or fibrosis.

Breast hematomas can sometimes lead to skin discoloration, inflammation, or fever. When a hematoma resolves, it may become fibrotic, leaving behind scar tissue. A resolving hematoma may liquify to form a seroma.

Post-surgical breast hematomas can also impede [[wound healing]] and therefore impact the cosmetic outcome. Hematomas are furthermore one of the risk factors for breast [[surgical site infection]]s.&lt;ref name="XueQian2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xue|first1=D.Q.|last2=Qian|first2=C.|last3=Yang|first3=L.|last4=Wang|first4=X.F.|title=Risk factors for surgical site infections after breast surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=European Journal of Surgical Oncology|volume=38|issue=5|year=2012|pages=375–381|issn=0748-7983|doi=10.1016/j.ejso.2012.02.179|pmid=22421530|type=review}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is preliminary evidence that, after [[breast implant]] surgery, the presence of hematoma increases the risk of developing [[capsular contracture]].&lt;ref name="HandelCordray2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Handel|first1=Neal|last2=Cordray|first2=Tracy|last3=Gutierrez|first3=Jaime|last4=Jensen|first4=J Arthur|title=A Long-Term Study of Outcomes, Complications, and Patient Satisfaction with Breast Implants|journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery|volume=117|issue=3|year=2006|pages=757–767|issn=0032-1052|doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000201457.00772.1d|pmid=16525261}}, see sections "Results" and "Conclusions"&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mammography screening]], scar tissue resulting from a breast hematoma can easily be confused with tumor tissue,&lt;ref name="HashimotoBauermeister2011-p69"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Beverly Hashimoto|author2=Donald Bauermeister|title=Breast Imaging: A Correlative Atlas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4FDqKGhzJaMC&amp;pg=PA69|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Thieme|isbn=978-1-60406-445-2|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the first years following surgery. Ultimately, [[fat necrosis]] may occur in the concerned region of the breast.&lt;ref name="radiopaedia"/&gt;

== Treatment ==
Small breast hematomas that cause no discomfort often require merely clinical observation, with ultrasound being used to monitor the resolution of the hematoma.

Large breast hematomas, or those that are not becoming smaller or that are causing discomfort, usually require drainage. Also hematomas that occur after surgery for excision of a malignant tumor are drained, because a hematoma to which [[radiation therapy|irradiation]] is applied is unlikely to ever resolve.&lt;ref name="Cance2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=W. G. Cance|title=Breast Surgery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nw9h3wRpscoC&amp;pg=PA96|date=1 January 2001|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-1-58603-159-6|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent hematoma can be drained by means of [[Fine needle aspiration|needle aspiration]] or (rarely) [[incision and drainage|open surgical drainage]].

[[Malay titles|Tan Sri]] [[Malay titles#Datuk Sri|Datuk Seri]] [[Dr.]] '''Chua Soi Lek''' ({{zh|s=蔡细历|t=蔡細歷|p=Cài Xìlì|poj=Chuà Soè-li̍k}}); born 2 January 1947, also known as Chua Kin Seng, is a [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] Malaysian politician from the state of [[Johor]]. He is the 9th President of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA), a major component party in [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition. He held the post of Minister of Health from 2004 until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It’s A Ministerial Jinx For MCA |url=https://www.malaysia-today.net/its-a-ministerial-jinx-for-mca/ |last1= |first1= |date=3 January 2008 |work=The Sun|publisher=MALAYSIA TODAY |accessdate=4 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born in [[Batu Pahat]], Johor. Chua received his early education at Sekolah Kebangsaan Lim Poon, then Batu Pahat High School and Muar High School. He was educated in medicine (SSB) at the [[University of Malaya]] in 1968-1973.

He was trained in [[psychology]] and practised [[psychiatry]] before entering politics. Chua set up his medical practice in 1977 after serving as a [[medical officer]] at the Batu Pahat Hospital. He sold the clinic in 1990 to pursue a full-time career in politics with MCA.

==Family==
Chua is married to Puan Sri Wong Sek Hin and the couple have three children. One of their sons, [[Chua Tee Yong]] replace him as member of parliament for Labis.

==Political career==
He was first elected as a state assemblyman for [[Bandar Penggaram|Penggaram]], Johor on MCA's ticket in 1986. He continued to serve Penggaram for 18 years through four consecutive state elections. Later, he became a Johor state government executive councillor. In the [[Malaysian general election, 2004|2004 general election]], he contested for the [[Labis]] parliamentary seat under the Barisan Nasional coalition and claimed victory. The then Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi|Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] appointed Chua into the [[Cabinet of Malaysia|Malaysian cabinet]] as the Minister of Health following that victory.

He held several prominent posts throughout his later career. He was the Member of Parliament for Labis, a MCA vice-president, Johor MCA state liaison committee chairman as well as Batu Pahat MCA division chairman until he resigned from all public and political offices on 2 January 2008 due to the eruption of a sensational sex scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/1/2/nation/19897373&amp;sec=nation |title=Chua – highly experienced |date=1 January 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex scandal and controversy===
On 1 January 2008, Chua admitted that he was the person featured in a sensational sex DVD that was widely being circulated in [[Johor]]. The [[Celebrity sex tape|two DVDs]] were distributed anonymously in [[Muar (town)|Muar]] and other towns in Johor show Dr Chua having scandal with a young woman, described by him as a "personal friend." The DVDs are believed to be wireless [[Closed-circuit television|hidden camera]] recordings in a hotel suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/litee/malaysia/article/Videos-killed-the-political-stars/|publisher= Malaysian Insider|title=Videos killed the political stars|date=17 February 2008 |accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed no involvement in the filming or production of the DVD in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/1/1/nation/20080101161931&amp;sec=nation |title=I am the one in the sex DVD, says Chua |date=1 January 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 January 2008, he formally announced his resignation from all posts including Member of Parliament for [[Labis]], vice presidency of [[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]], and Minister of Health at a press conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/1/2/nation/20080102155121&amp;sec=nation&amp;focus=1 |title=Chua resigns after sex scandal |date=2 January 2008 |accessdate=2 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chua later remarked his downfall was due to his dedication to his work as Health Minister and MCA Vice-President, which caused his political rivals to grow suspicious of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/1/4/nation/19913859&amp;sec=nation&amp;focus=1 |title=Chua blames downfall on hard work |date=4 January 2008 |accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MCA deputy presidency===
In the [[Malaysian general election 2008|2008 general elections]], MCA won only 15 parliamentary seats out of 40 they contested. Some grassroots leaders and former top leaders including Dr Chua, demanded the President, [[Ong Ka Ting]], step down to take responsibility.

He returned to active politics in the second half of 2008 and won the [[Batu Pahat]] Division chairman post uncontested. Then he contested the MCA deputy presidency, defeating [[Ong Ka Chuan]], [[Donald Lim]] and [[Lee Hak Teik]] in a four-cornered fight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://warkah.com/chua-soi-lek-elected-as-the-deputy-president-of-the-mca/ Chua Soi Lek Elected As The Deputy President Of The MCA] Warkah. 19 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite that, Dr Chua was only appointed chairman of the Government Policy Monitoring bureau and left out of the MCA leadership in Johor by party president, [[Ong Tee Keat]]. This was seen as a move to isolate Dr Chua politically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenutgraph.com/pr-courts-chua-soi-lek Pakatan Rakyat courts Chua Soi Lek] The Nut Graph. 30 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Chua was expelled from the party in August 2009 by the MCA Disciplinary Committee for his sex scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/111492 Soi Lek expelled] Malaysiakini. 26 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 Extraordinary General Meeting ===
In 2009, Chua Soi Lek's supporters sparked an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) to challenge Ong Tee Keat's Presidency and reinstitate Dr Chua as a member and deputy president.

The EGM was held on 10 October, where a number of resolutions were made challenging Chua Soi Lek's removal from MCA and his sacking as deputy president of MCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/10/10/nation/20091010083515&amp;sec=nation|publisher=TheStar Online|title=MCA EGM: Delegates make dramatic decisions (Update 8)|date=10 October 2008 |accessdate= 10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vote of no confidence against Datuk Seri Ong Tee Keat passed by 14 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/articles/20091010100336/Article/index_html |publisher=News Straits Times |title=Losers all |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011042633/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/articles/20091010100336/Article/index_html |archivedate=11 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other resolution, Dr Chua's expulsion was overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20091010-172908.html| publisher= AsiaOne| title=Suspended Chua Soi Lek back as member of MCA|date=10 October 2008 |accessdate= 10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ong and Chua both refused to resign, and united under a "greater unity plan," putting their differences aside temporarily. However, some central committee members, led by [[Liow Tiong Lai]], previously aligned with Ong, demanded fresh elections.

===MCA presidency===
In early March 2010, Chua and his supporters in the central committee (CC), joined other CCs led by [[Liow Tiong Lai]], in resigning. With the resignation of two-thirds of the central committee, fresh elections were to be held as per the party constitution. Chua contested the presidency against incumbent Ong Tee Keat and former president Ong Ka Ting. In the three-cornered fight, Chua emerged victorious while incumbent Tee Keat finished in third place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20100329-207343.html|title=Chua's the No.1|date=29 March 2010|work=[[New Straits Times]]/asiaone|accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v8/newsindex.php?id=486037|title=Dr Chua Soi Lek Pulls Off double Impossible|publisher=[[Bernama]] |date =March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming president, Chua focused on rebuilding the appearance of unity within MCA after a year of public infighting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysinchew.com/node/37434 Soi Lek names appointees, urges members to unite] mysinchew.com 7 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political debates===
In February 2012, Chua Soi Lek broke from Malaysian political norms by having a public debate with [[Lim Guan Eng]], Chief Minister of Penang. The first debate continued with another public debate, labelled as Debate 2.0, that was held on 8 July 2012. Both debates generated tremendous public and media interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/7/9/nation/11628290&amp;sec=nation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/203036]&lt;/ref&gt;

===MCA poor performance in 13th general election===
In the [[Malaysian general election, 2013]] MCA only won 7 of the 37 federal seats and 11 of the 90 state seats it contested. In the general election in 2008, it won 15 parliamentary and 32 state seats. Chua said MCA remained adamant in not accepting any government post at both state and federal level, following its dismal performance in the just-concluded 13th General Election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mca.org.my/en/mca-adamant-in-declining-government-posts-soi-lek-read-more-mca-adamant-in-declining-government-posts-soi-lek-general-new-straits-times-httpwww-nst-com-mynationgeneralmca-adamant-in-de/ MCA adamant in declining government posts – Soi Lek] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629054509/http://www.mca.org.my/en/mca-adamant-in-declining-government-posts-soi-lek-read-more-mca-adamant-in-declining-government-posts-soi-lek-general-new-straits-times-httpwww-nst-com-mynationgeneralmca-adamant-in-de/ |date=29 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/5/11/nation/20130511112856&amp;sec=nation MCA presidential council meets over party's performance in GE13]&lt;/ref&gt; The poor performance in the election led to calls for Chua's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/mca-elders-call-for-soi-leks-head-to-roll |title=MCA elders call for Soi Lek’s head to roll|author= Boo Su-Lyn |date= 10 May 2013 |work=The Malaysian Insider }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chua did not enter the following party poll for President, and in December 2013, [[Liow Tiong Lai]] was elected the President of MCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/se-asia/story/malaysias-former-health-minister-liow-tiong-lai-new-mca-president-201312 |title=Malaysia's former health minister Liow Tiong Lai is new MCA president |author=Lester Kong |work=The Straits Times|date=21 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/12/13/how-will-chua-soi-lek-be-remembered/ |title=How will Chua Soi Lek be remembered? |author=Leven Woon |date=13 December 2013 |work=Free Malaysia Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crown lengthening''' is a surgical procedure performed by a [[dentist]], or more frequently a specialist periodontist. There are a number of reasons for considering crown lengthening in a treatment plan. Commonly, the procedure is used to expose a greater amount of [[tooth]] structure for the purpose of subsequently restoring the tooth [[Crown (dentistry)|prosthetically]].&lt;ref name="rest2"&gt;Takei, HH; Azzi, RR; Han, TJ: Preparation of the Periodontium for Restorative Dentistry.  In Newman, MG; Takei, HH; Carranza, FA; editors: ''Carranza’s Clinical Periodontology'', 9th Edition. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Company, 2002. page 945.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other indications include accessing subgingival [[Tooth decay|caries]], accessing perforations and to treat aesthetic disproportions such as a gummy smile. There are a number of procedures used to achieve an increase in crown length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Harbi, Ahmad|first=F., I.|date=February 23, 2018|title=A guide to minimally invasive crown lengthening and tooth preparation for rehabilitating pink and white aesthetics|url=|journal=British Dental Journal|volume=224| issue =  4|pages=|via=British Dental Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biomechanical considerations==

===Biologic width===
[[Image:Periodontium.svg|thumb|right|'''Biologic width''' is the natural distance between the base of the gingival sulcus ''(G)'' and the height of the alveolar bone ''(I)''. The gingival sulcus ''(G)'' is a little crevice that lies between the [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] of the tooth crown and the [[sulcular epithelium]].  At the base of this crevice lies the [[junctional epithelium]], which adheres via [[hemidesmosome]]s to the surface of the tooth, and from the base of the crevice to the height of the [[alveolar bone]] ''(C)'' is approximately 2 mm.]] Biologic width is the distance established by "the [[junctional epithelium]] and [[gingival fibers|connective tissue attachment]] to the root surface" of a [[tooth]].&lt;ref name="rest2"/&gt;  In other words, it is the height between the deepest point of the gingival sulcus and the alveolar bone crest. This distance is important to consider when fabricating [[dental restoration]]s, because they must respect the natural architecture of the gingival attachment if harmful consequences are to be avoided. The biologic width is patient specific and may vary anywhere from 0.75-4.3&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="note1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biologic Width Part I|url=https://www.speareducation.com/spear-review/2014/12/biologic-width-part|website=www.speareducation.com|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the 1961 paper by Gargiulo, the mean biologic width was determined to be 2.04&amp;nbsp;mm, of which 1.07&amp;nbsp;mm is occupied by the [[periodontal ligament|connective tissue attachment]] and another approximate 0.97&amp;nbsp;mm is occupied by the [[junctional epithelium]].&lt;ref name="rest2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gargiulo, AW, et al. &lt;u&gt;Dimensions and relations of the dentogingival junction in humans&lt;/u&gt;. ''J Perio'' 1961;32:261–267.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because it is impossible to perfectly restore a tooth to the precise coronal edge of the junctional epithelium, it is often recommended to remove enough bone to have 3mm between the restorative margin and the crest of alveolar bone.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, M; Skurow, HM. &lt;u&gt;The intracrevicular restorative margin, the biologic width, and the maintenance of the gingival margin&lt;/u&gt;. ''Int J Perio Rest D'' 1984;3:31–49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brägger, U.; et al. &lt;u&gt;Surgical crown lengthening of the clinical crown&lt;/u&gt;. ''J Clin Perio'' 1992;19:58–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Padbury Jr, A, et al. &lt;u&gt;Interactions between the gingiva and the margin of restorations&lt;/u&gt;. ''J Clin Perio'' 2003;30:379–385.&lt;/ref&gt;  When restorations do not take these considerations into account and violate biologic width, three things tend to occur:&lt;ref name="note1" /&gt;
*chronic [[pain]]
*chronic [[inflammation]] of the gingiva
*unpredictable loss of [[alveolar bone]]

===Ferrule effect===
In addition to crown lengthening to establish a proper biologic width, a 2&amp;nbsp;mm height of tooth structure should be available to allow for a ferrule effect.&lt;ref&gt;Galen WW, Mueller KI: Restoration of the Endodontically Treated Tooth.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 784.&lt;/ref&gt;  A ferrule, in respect to teeth, is a band that encircles the external dimension of residual tooth structure, not unlike the metal bands that exist around a barrel.  Sufficient vertical height of tooth structure that will be grasped by the future crown is necessary to allow for a ferrule effect of the future prosthetic crown; it has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of fracture in the endodontically treated tooth.&lt;ref&gt;Barkhodar RA, Radke R, Abbasi J: &lt;u&gt;Effect of metal collars on resistance of endodontically treated teeth to root fracture&lt;/u&gt;. ''J Prosthet Dent'' 61:676, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because beveled tooth structure is not parallel to the vertical axis of the tooth, it does not properly contribute to ferrule height; thus, a desire to bevel the crown margin by 1&amp;nbsp;mm would require an additional 1&amp;nbsp;mm of bone removal in the crown lengthening procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Fixed prosthodontic lecture series notes, Dr. Louis DiPede, New Jersey Dental School, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Frequently, however, restorations are performed without such a bevel.

Some recent studies suggest that, while ferrule is certainly desirable, it should not be provided at the expense of the remaining tooth/root structure.&lt;ref&gt;Stankiewicz NR, Wilson PR. &lt;u&gt;The ferrule effect: a literature review&lt;/u&gt;. ''Int Endod J'', 35:575–581, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, it has also been shown that the "difference between an effective, long-term restoration and a failure can be as small as 1 mm of additional tooth structure that, when encased by a ferrule, provides great protection.  When such a long-lasting, functional restoration cannot be predictably created, tooth extraction should be considered."&lt;ref&gt;Galen WW, Mueller KI: Restoration of the Endodontically Treated Tooth.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 771.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crown-to-root ratio===
The [[Dental alveolus|alveolar bone]] surrounding one tooth will naturally surround an adjacent tooth, and removing bone for a crown lengthening procedure will effectively damage  the bony support of adjacent teeth to some inevitable extent, as well as unfavorably increase the [[crown-to-root ratio]].  Additionally, once bone is removed, it is almost impossible to regain it to previous levels, and in case a patient would like to have an implant placed in the future, there might not be enough bone in the region once a crown lengthening procedure has been completed.  Thus, it would be prudent for patients to thoroughly discuss all of their treatment planning options with their dentist before undergoing an irreversible procedure such as crown lengthening.

===Treatment planning===
[[File:Feldspathic VM9 Porcelain Crowns.jpg|thumb|Replacement of unaesthetic crowns on the upper central teeth after undergoing crown lengthening and fabrication of new restorations.]]
Crown lengthening is often done in conjunction with a few other expensive and time-consuming procedures of which the combined goal is to improve the prosthetic forecast of a tooth.  If a tooth, because of its relative lack of solid tooth structure, also requires a [[post and core]], and thus, [[root canal therapy|endodontic treatment]], the total combined time, effort and cost of the various procedures, as well as the impaired prognosis due to the combined inherent failure rates of each procedure, might combine to make it reasonable to have the tooth extracted. If the patient and the extraction site make for eligible candidates, it might be possible to have an [[dental implant|implant]] placed and restored with more esthetic, timely, inexpensive and reliable results.  It is important to consider the many options available during the treatment planning stages of dental care.

An alternative to surgical crown lengthening is orthodontic forced eruption, it is non-invasive, does not remove or damage the bone and can be cost effective. The tooth is extruded a couple of millimeters with simple bracketing of adjacent teeth and using light forces this will only take a couple of months. A [[fiberotomy]] is performed after crown lengthening and is easily performed by the general dentist. In many cases such as this one shown, surgery and extraction may be avoided if patient is treated orthodontically rather than periodontally.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Crown Lengthening Techniques ==

=== Apically Repositioned Flap with Osseous Recontouring (Resection)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clinical Periodontology and Implant Dentistry|last=Lindhe, Lang|first=Jan, Niklaus|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated|year=2015|isbn=9780470672488|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
An apically repositioned flap is a widely used procedure that involves flap elevation with subsequent osseous contouring. The flap is designed such that it is replaced more apical to its original position and thus immediate exposure of sound tooth structure is gained. As discussed above, when planning a crown lengthening procedure consideration must be given to maintenance of the biologic width.

As a general rule, at least 4&amp;nbsp;mm of sound tooth structure must be exposed at the time of surgery. This therefore allows for proliferation of the supracrestal soft tissues, which are estimated to cover 2– 3&amp;nbsp;mm of the coronal root structure thereby leaving 1– 2&amp;nbsp;mm of supragingivally located sound tooth structure. Furthermore, thought has to be given to the inherent tendency of gingival tissues to bridge abrupt changes in the contour of the bone crest. As such it is advised that bone recontouring must be performed not only around the problem tooth but also at the adjacent teeth to gradually reduce the osseous profile.

Consequently, substantial amounts of attachment may have to be sacrificed when crown lengthening is accomplished with an apically positioned flap technique. It is also important to remember that, for esthetic reasons, symmetry of tooth length must be maintained between the right and left sides of the dental arch. This may, in some situations, call for the inclusion of even more teeth in the surgical procedure.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clinical Cases in Periodontics|last=Karimbux|first=Nadeem|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated|year=2011|isbn=9780813807942|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indications ====
Crown lengthening of multiple teeth in a quadrant or sextant of the dentition

==== Contraindications ====
Single teeth in the aesthetic zone becomes increasingly destructive

==== Technique&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ====
# A reverse bevel incision is made using a scalpel. This initial incision is guided by pre-operative planning and is based on the amount of tooth structure to be exposed. The beveling incision also should follow a scalloped outline, to ensure maximal interproximal coverage of the alveolar bone when the flap subsequently is repositioned. Vertical releasing incisions extending out into the alveolar mucosa, past the mucogingival junction, are made at each of the end points of the reverse incision, thereby making apical repositioning of the flap possible.
# A full‐thickness mucoperiosteal flap is then raised to expose the root surfaces. The flap, incorporating the buccal/ lingual gingiva and alveolar mucosa, then has to be elevated beyond the mucogingival line in order to be able later to reposition the soft tissue apically. The marginal collar of tissue is then removed with curettes.
# Osseous recontouring is then performed using a rotating round bur and copious water spray or bone chisels. The recontouring should aim to re-create the normal form of the alveolar crest, but at a more apical level.
# Following the osseous surgery, the flap is repositioned to the level of the newly recontoured alveolar bone crest and secured in position. Full soft tissue coverage is inherently more difficult and as such a periodontal dressing should be applied to protect the denuded interproximal alveolar bone to retain the soft tissue at the level of the bone crest.

==== Advantages ====
Immediate increase in sound tooth structure can be achieved

==== Disadvantages ====
Difficult procedure for patients to tolerate, increased post operative pain &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Forced Tooth Eruption&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ===
Orthodontic tooth movement can be used to erupt teeth in adults. If moderate eruptive forces are applied, the entire eruptive apparatus will move in unison with the tooth. As such, the units required must be extruded a distance equal to or slightly longer than the portion of sound tooth structure that will be exposed in the following surgical treatment. Once stabilised, a full thickness flap is then elevated and osseous recontouring is performed to expose the required tooth structure. It is noted that to restore aesthetic proportions correctly the hard and soft tissues of adjacent teeth should remain unchanged.

==== Indications ====
Forced tooth eruption is indicated where crown lengthening is required, but attachment and bone from adjacent teeth must be preserved.

==== Contraindications ====
Forced tooth eruption requires a fixed orthodontic appliance. This poses problems in patients with reduced dentitions, in such instances alternative crown lengthening procedures must be considered

==== Technique&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ====
Orthodontic brackets are bonded to the teeth requiring crown lengthening surgery and then to adjacent teeth, these are then combined within an archwire. A power elastic band is then tied from the bracket to the archwire (or the bar), which pulls the tooth coronally. The direction of the tooth movement must be carefully checked to ensure no tilting or movement of adjacent teeth occurs.

Forced Tooth Eruption can also be performed with fiberotomy. This technique is adopted when gingival margins and crystal bone height are to be maintained at their pretreatment locations. Fiberotomy is performed at 7-10 day intervals during treatment. A scalpel is used to sever supracrestal connective tissue fibres, thereby preventing crystal bone from following the root in a coronal direction.

==== Advantages ====
Preserves osseous structure around adjacent teeth

==== Disadvantages ====
Procedure requires fixed wire placement and treatment time can be prolonged

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6151">'''Energy gels''' are [[carbohydrate]] gels that provide energy for exercise and promote recovery,&lt;ref name="aboutgu"&gt;About [http://www.guenergy.net/ GU Energy Gel][http://walking.about.com/library/weekly/ucgu.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halfrunning"&gt;[http://www.half-marathon-running.com/energy-gel.html Energy gel for running - how to use, ingredients and selection]&lt;/ref&gt; commonly used in endurance events such as [[running]], [[cycling]], and [[triathlon]]s.  Energy gels are also referred to as endurance gels, sports gels, nutritional gels, and carbohydrate gels.&lt;ref name="halfrunning" /&gt;  They come in small, single-serve plastic packets.  Each packet has a strip with a small notch at the top that can be peeled off to reveal an opening through which the gel can be consumed.

==History==
Sports energy gels emerged in the United Kingdom in 1986 as a "convenient, prewrapped, portable" way to deliver [[Carbohydrate metabolism|carbohydrates]] during endurance events.&lt;ref name=Schwarb&gt;{{Cite news|last=Schwarb|first=John|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/01/03/Sports/Forget_carb_filled_ba.shtml|title=Forget carb-filled bars, runners gaga for goo|work=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]|date=January 3, 2003|accessdate=January 13, 2014|location=St. Petersburg, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gels have a gooey texture and are sometimes referred to as "goo" generically.&lt;ref name=Dialogues&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gallman|first=Judith M.|title=Brian Vaughan: GU Guru|journal=Oakland Magazine|url=http://www.oaklandmagazine.com/Oakland-Magazine/January-February-2009/Dialogues/|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-11-19/news/0411190030_1_energy-gels-power-gel-electrolytes|title=A new fuel for athletes: energy gels|date=November 19, 2004|accessdate=January 23, 2014|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|first=Judith|last=Blake|issn=1930-8965|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gel Leppin Squeezy was distributed at the Hawaii [[Ironman Triathlon]] in 1988. Once considered a "cult product in clear packaging", energy gel products are now marketed in fancy packaging and come in a variety of flavors.&lt;ref name=Schwarb/&gt; The energy gel market grew during the 1990s, as professional athletes began endorsing products. Manufacturers generally encourage the consumption of multiple packets, with water, when participating in endurance events. Individual packets typically cost between 99 cents and $1.29 (as reported by the ''[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]'' in 2003).&lt;ref name=Schwarb/&gt;

==Nutritional behavior==
Once consumed, the carbohydrates found in the gels are absorbed into the blood to supply the body with [[calorie]]s and [[nutrient]]s to fuel exercise activity by helping to delay muscular fatigue, raise [[blood sugar]] levels, and enhance performance.&lt;ref name="runningtimes"&gt;[http://runningtimes.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=6677&amp;PageNum=4 Running Times Magazine: Running Time's Guide to Sports Drinks and Gels]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most energy gels have no [[fat]], [[fiber]], or [[protein]], so they can be digested quickly.&lt;ref name="aboutgu" /&gt;  They contain mainly [[sugar]]s and [[maltodextrin]]s, which make them similar to [[sports drink]]s without the water.&lt;ref name="rwgel"&gt;[http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-242-301--5956-2-1X2X3-4,00.html Carbohydrates for Runners at Runner's World.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Since simple carbohydrates slow down gastric emptying and can cause [[gastrointestinal distress]] in athletes,&lt;ref&gt;de Oliveira EP1, Burini RC. J Int Soc Sports Nutr. 2011 Sep 28;8:12. doi: 10.1186/1550-2783-8-12. Food-dependent, exercise-induced gastrointestinal distress.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Case Study: Utilizing a Low FODMAP Diet to Combat Exercise-Induced Gastrointestinal Symptoms. Lis D, Ahuja KD, Stellingwerff T, Kitic CM, Fell J. Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab. 2016 Aug 24:1-17.&lt;/ref&gt; there are attempts to create new categories of energy gels made with complex, long chain carbohydrates and/or fat. [[Spring gel]] is an example of a gel with low sugar, low glycemic index carbohydrate content with the addition of fat &lt;ref&gt;Ultrarunning Magazine: Power in your pocket. August, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and Vespapower is an example of a gel made with fat.  Some gels, such as e-Gel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cranksports.com/products/eGel/ e-Gel Electrolyte Energy Gel]&lt;/ref&gt; also come with added [[electrolyte]]s.&lt;ref name="rwgel" /&gt; There are also gels with extras such as [[ginseng]] and other herbs, [[amino acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s, and [[Coenzyme Q10]].&lt;ref name="rwgel" /&gt;  [[Caffeine]] can be found in some gels as well.&lt;ref name="rwgel" /&gt; Examples of common energy gels are [[GU (food)|GU]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guenergy.com/products/gu-energy-gel GU Energy Products]&lt;/ref&gt; [[PowerBar]] Gel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerbar.com/products/36/powerbar-energy-gel.aspx Powerbar Energy Gel Products]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clif Bar|Clif Shot]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clifbar.com/food/products_shot_gel/ Clif Bar &amp; Company: Clif Shot]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
The recommended use of an energy gel is 15 minutes before starting and 30–45 minutes after starting the endurance exercise.&lt;ref name="halfrunning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="runningtimes" /&gt; The first gel prior to exercise may be skipped in favor of a high carbohydrate snack instead. Energy gels are then to be used every 30–45 minutes during exercise. The notch can be peeled off at the top and an intake of energy gel is recommended to be followed with a drink of water to avoid risk of dehydration.&lt;ref name="halfrunning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rwgel" /&gt; This is especially important for gels with high simple carbohydrate content. These gels create hyperosmolar gastric content which prevents carbohydrate absorption and gastrointestinal distress. For this reason, energy gels with low sugar content are frequently called "hydrogels". The exact intake of the gel varies for every athlete depending on their metabolism, body weight, and fitness level.

'''Eosinophilic fasciitis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|iː|ə|ˌ|s|ɪ|n|ə|ˈ|f|ɪ|l|ɪ|k|_|ˌ|f|æ|ʃ|i|ˈ|aɪ|t|ᵻ|s|,_|ˌ|iː|oʊ|-|,_|-|ˌ|f|æ|s|i|-}}{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-21|Eosinophilic}} {{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-21|fasciitis}}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|accessdate=2016-01-21|Eosinophilic}} {{MerriamWebsterDictionary|accessdate=2016-01-21|fasciitis}}}}), also known as "Shulman's syndrome",&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rapini, Ronald P. |author2=Bolognia, Jean L. |author3=Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[fasciitis]], the inflammatory diseases that affect the [[fascia]], the connective tissues surrounding muscles, blood vessels and nerves. Unlike other diseases in that category, it is limited to the arms and legs, and usually resolves itself, although some cases require corticosteroids, and some cases are associated with [[aplastic anemia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/musculoskeletal_and_connective_tissue_disorders/autoimmune_rheumatic_disorders/eosinophilic_fasciitis_ef.html Merck Manual, Professional Edition, Eosinophilic Fasciitis]&lt;/ref&gt;

The presentation of eosinophilic fasciitis is similar to [[scleroderma]] or [[systemic sclerosis]]. However, unlike scleroderma, it affects the [[fascia]], not the skin ([[dermis]]). The characteristic and severe effects of scleroderma and systemic sclerosis, such as Raynaud's syndrome, involvement of the extremities, prominent small blood vessels ([[telangiectasia]]), and visceral changes such as swallowing problems, are absent.

It was first characterized in 1974,&lt;ref name=pmid1224441/&gt; and it is not yet known whether it is actually a distinct condition or just a different presentation. However, it remains used for diagnostic purposes.

Several cases have been reported after strenuous [[exercise]].

==Symptoms==
As it is a rare disease, a clear set of symptoms is difficult to define. Usually, patients show severe pain and swelling is reported but clinical presentations vary. It can have an 'orange peel' like appearance.&lt;ref name=BischoffIJD&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bischoff|first=Lindsay|author2=Chris T. Derk|title=Eosinophilic fasciitis: demographics, disease pattern and response to treatment: report of 12 cases and review of the literature|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|date=January 2008|volume=47|issue=1|pages=29–35|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2007.03544.x|pmid=18173597}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less common features are joint pain and carpal tunnel syndrome.

==Cause==
Most cases are [[idiopathic]], but several triggers might related to the development of Eosinophilic fasciitis,&lt;ref name=pmid24424187&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.autrev.2014.01.019 |pmid=24424187 |title=Diagnosis and classification of eosinophilic fasciitis |journal=Autoimmunity Reviews |volume=13 |issue=4–5 |pages=379–82 |year=2014 |last1=Pinal-Fernandez |first1=I |last2=Selva-O'Callaghan |first2=A |last3=Grau |first3=J.M }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as Strenuous exercise,&lt;ref name=pmid1224441&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1224441 |year=1975 |author1=Shulman |first1=L.

==Diagnosis==

The key to diagnosis is skin changes combined with blood eosinophilia but the most accurate test is a skin, fascia and muscle biopsy.

==Treatment==
Common treatments include [[corticosteroid]]s&lt;ref name="pmid16902285"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Antic M, Lautenschlager S, Itin PH |title=Eosinophilic fasciitis 30 years after - what do we really know?

'''The Famine of 1866–1868''' was the last [[famine]] in [[Finland]], and (along with the subsequent [[Swedish famine of 1867-1869]]) the last major naturally caused famine in [[Europe]]. 

In Finland the famine is known as "the great hunger years", or {{lang|fi|suuret nälkävuodet}}. About 8.5% of the entire population died of hunger;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Buchert, Peter | title=Frosten fick finska folket på knä | newspaper=Hufvudstadsbladet | date=23 September 2017 | pages=12–14 | url=http://www.hbl.fi/artikel/150-ar-sedan-hungersnoden-frosten-och-finanspolitiken-fick-finska-folket-pa-kna/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the hardest-hit areas up to 20%. The total death toll was 270,000 in three years, about 150,000 in excess of normal mortality. The worst-hit areas were [[Satakunta (historical province)|Satakunta]], [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]], [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]], and [[North Karelia]].

==Causes==

Parts of the country had suffered poor harvests in previous years, most notably in 1862.   The summer of 1866 was extremely rainy, and staple crops failed widely: [[potato]]es and [[root vegetables]] rotted in the fields, and conditions for sowing [[grain]] in the autumn were unfavourable. When stored food ran out, thousands took to the roads to beg. The following winter was hard, and spring was late. In [[Helsinki]], the average temperature in May 1867 was +{{convert|1.8|°C|°F|abbr=on|lk=on}}, about {{convert|8|C-change|F-change|abbr=on}} below the long-time average and by far the coldest such month in the meteorological record. In many places, lakes and rivers remained frozen until June.   

After a promisingly warm midsummer, freezing temperatures in early September ravaged crops; as a result, the harvest was about half the average.   By the autumn of 1867, people were dying by the thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nutrition and immunology: principles and practice |first1=M. Eric|last1= Gershwin|first2=J. Bruce |last2=German|first3= Carl L.|last3= Keen |publisher =Humana Press|year=2000 |isbn=0-89603-719-3|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actions==

The government of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] was ill-equipped to handle a crisis of such magnitude.   There was no money readily available to import food from largely monopolized Central European markets, and the government was slow to recognize the severity of the situation. Finance minister [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman]], in particular, did not want to borrow, lest Finland's recently introduced currency, the [[Finnish markka]], be weakened because of high interest rates.   When money was finally borrowed from the Rothschild bank of [[Frankfurt]] in late 1867, the crisis was already full blown, and grain prices had risen in Europe.   In addition, it was difficult to transport what little aid could be mustered in a country with poor communications. A number of emergency [[public works]] projects were set up, foremost among them the construction of the [[Riihimäki-Saint Petersburg railroad|railway line from Riihimäki to Saint Petersburg]].

==Aftermath==

The weather returned to normal in 1868, and that year's harvest was somewhat better than average, yet, [[contagious diseases]] that had spread in the previous year took many additional lives.

Programs were launched to increase the diversity of Finnish agriculture, and rapidly improving communications made a recurrence of such a famine less likely.

In general, ordinary Finns at the time saw the famine as an [[act of God]]. Few would have expected [[Grand Duke of Finland|the crown]] to be able to do much more, and blame was directed mainly at local officials. No significant working class [[political movement]] had developed yet that could have capitalized politically on the crisis. The urban population was small, and for the people of the countryside, the first priority was to resume normal lives. In short, the famine did not threaten the [[social order]], but its memory cast a long shadow.

The '''Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics''' (FIND) is a global health non-profit based in [[Geneva|Geneva, Switzerland.]] FIND functions as a product development partnership, engaging in active collaboration with over 150 partners to facilitate the development, evaluation, and implementation of diagnostic tests for poverty-related diseases. The organisation's Geneva headquarters are in [[Campus Biotech]]. Country offices are located in [[New Delhi|New Delhi, India]]; [[Cape Town|Cape Town, South Africa]]; and [[Hanoi|Hanoi, Viet Nam.]]

==History==
FIND was launched at the 56th [[World Health Assembly]] in 2003. In 2011, FIND was recognized as an "Other International Organization" by the Swiss Government, alongside [[DNDi]] and [[Medicines for Malaria Venture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dndi.org/2010/media-centre/press-releases/international-status-granted/|title=International status granted to three not-for-profit organizations in Switzerland – DNDi|website=www.dndi.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Priorities==
The organization focuses on improving diagnosis in several disease areas, including [[hepatitis C]], [[HIV]], [[malaria]], [[neglected tropical diseases]] ([[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[Chagas disease]], [[leishmaniasis]], [[buruli ulcer]]), and [[tuberculosis]]. Alongside this, FIND works on diagnostic connectivity, [[antimicrobial resistance]], acute febrile illness, and outbreak preparedness.

To support this work, FIND engages in development of target product profiles, maintains clinical trial platforms, manages specimen banks, negotiates preferential product pricing for developing markets, and creates and implements trainings and lab strengthening tools.

==Operating model==
Work is guided by a Board of Directors which approves policies, organizational strategy and budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.finddx.org/board-of-directors/|title=Board of Directors - FIND|work=FIND|access-date=2017-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staff and the Board of Directors are advised by a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC), which provides advice on science and technology, assists in developing strategy, supports the scientific management process of projects, and offers support on issues ranging from diagnostics development to licensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.finddx.org/sac/|title=Scientific Advisory Committee - FIND|work=FIND|access-date=2017-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
FIND receives its funding from more than a dozen donors, including bilateral and multilateral organizations as well as private foundations.

'''''Girl, Interrupted''''' is a best-selling&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981084,00.html The Unconfessional Confessionalist], [[Time Magazine]], July 11, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[1993 in literature|1993]] [[memoir]] by [[Americans|American]] author [[Susanna Kaysen]], relating her experiences as a young woman in a [[psychiatric hospital]] in the 1960s after being diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]]. The memoir's title is a reference to the [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]] painting ''[[Girl Interrupted at Her Music]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117759846.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 Girl, Interrupted], [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], December 10, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

While writing the novel ''Far Afield'', Kaysen began to recall her almost two years at [[McLean Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5503309_ITM A teenager's interrupted life], [[Knight Ridder]] Newspapers, December 1, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; She obtained her file from the hospital with the help of a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-4491115_ITM |title=''Girl, Interrupted'' (Reel Life) |journal=Clinical Psychiatry News |date=August 1, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218150247/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-4491115_ITM |archivedate=February 18, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the memoir was adapted into a [[Girl, Interrupted (film)|film of the same name]] starring [[Winona Ryder]], [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Brittany Murphy]]. It was directed by [[James Mangold]].

==Plot==
In April 1967, 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen is admitted to McLean Hospital, in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]], after attempting [[suicide]] by overdosing on pills. She denies that it was a suicide attempt to a psychiatrist, who suggests she take time to regroup in McLean, a private mental hospital. Susanna is diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]], and her stay extends to 18 months&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5486864_ITM Susanna Kaysen finds stability in examining youthful 'insanity'], [[Knight Ridder|Knight-Ridder Newspapers]], August 4, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the proposed couple of weeks.

Fellow patients Polly, Cynthia, Lisa Rowe, Lisa Cody, Georgina and Daisy contribute to Susanna's experiences at McLean as she describes their personal issues and how they come to cope with the time they must spend in the hospital. Susanna also introduces the reader to particular staff members, including Valerie, Dr. Wick and Mrs. McWeeney. Susanna and the other girls are eventually informed that the recently released Daisy committed [[suicide]] on her birthday. Daisy's death deeply saddens the girls and they hold a prolonged moment of silence in her memory.

Susanna reflects on the nature of her illness, including difficulty making sense of visual patterns, and suggests that [[sanity]] is a falsehood constructed to help the "healthy" feel "normal" in comparison. She also questions how doctors treat [[mental illness]], and whether they are treating the [[brain]] or the [[mind]]. During her stay in the ward, Susanna also undergoes a period of [[depersonalization]], where she bites open the flesh on her hand after she becomes terrified that she has "lost her bones". She develops a frantic obsession with the verification of this proposed reality and even insists on seeing an X-ray of herself to make sure. This hectic moment is described with shorter, choppy sentences that show Kaysen's state of mind and thought processes as she went through them. Also, during a trip to the dentist with Valerie, Susanna becomes frantic after she wakes from the general [[anesthesia]], when no one will tell her how long she was unconscious, and she fears that she has lost time. Like the incident with her bones, Kaysen here also rapidly spirals into a panicky and obsessive state that is only ultimately calmed with medication.

After leaving McLean, Susanna mentions that she kept in touch with Georgina and eventually saw Lisa, now a single mother who was about to board the subway with her toddler son and seemed, although quirky, to be sane.

===Structure===
''Girl, Interrupted'' does not follow a linear [[Narrative structure|storyline]], but instead the author provides personal stories through a series of short descriptions of events and personal reflections on why she was placed in the hospital. She begins by talking about the concept of a parallel universe and how easy it is to slip into one, comparing insanity to an alternate world. She discusses how some people fall into insanity gradually and others just snap. Kaysen also details the doctor's visit before first going to the hospital and the taxi ride there at the beginning of the book before launching into the chronicles of her time at the hospital.

==Characters==
There are two main groups of characters, the patients and the staff. In addition to those there are her parents, her boyfriend and various other minor characters such as her former boss.

===Patients===
;Susanna Kaysen
:The autobiographical main character, Susanna Kaysen is admitted to a psychiatric ward to be treated for [[borderline personality disorder]] following a suicide attempt. She voluntarily admits herself after a short consultation with a psychiatrist who is also an acquaintance of the family. She is told that she will only be staying there for a few weeks, but it turns out to be one and a half years instead. Throughout the book, she frequently contrasts the time of the consultation, twenty minutes, to the time she ended up spending there.
;Lisa Rowe
:Lisa is diagnosed as a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]], but whether she actually is one is left open to interpretation. Lisa periodically escapes from the hospital, only to be found a day or two later and re-admitted. She is usually happy enough to be back though she does put up a fight when restrained. She is an ex-junkie who never sleeps and barely eats, and enjoys making trouble for the staff. She apparently takes some pride in her diagnosis. Although she has a therapist assigned to her, she never actually sees him. Lisa is not in contact with her family except her brother, but the extent of their contact is not described. She also has a lawyer, though it appears he is mostly used to threaten the staff if she doesn't get what she wants. Her behavior is wildly unpredictable, and while she can be kind, she is also capable of cruelty towards the other patients. For example, Lisa has an ongoing rivalry with Lisa Cody that ends in Lisa Cody reverting to drugs.
;Polly Clark
:Polly is a disfigured patient who was hospitalised for [[schizophrenia]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Polly has severe scarring on her body, the result of setting herself on fire. According to Kaysen, because of the sheer guts it took to actually do it, Polly is highly respected for her courage, to the extent that none of the patients will ask why she did it. During her first year at the hospital, she appears calm and even cheerful: "Life was hellish, she knew that. But, her smile hinted, she'd burned all that out of her."&lt;ref name=Virago&gt;Susana Kaysen, ''Girl, Interrupted'' (Virago Press, 2000 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; But one day she suddenly breaks down and begins to scream inconsolably, as if realizing for the first time her appearance and the permanency of it. Kaysen then realizes that while the other patients might be released from the hospital, Polly is trapped forever in her scarred body.
;Georgina Tuskin
:Hospitalized for [[schizophrenia]],&lt;ref name=Virago/&gt; Georgina is Susanna's roommate at the institution. The two of them are considered the healthiest patients on the ward and are good friends throughout the book. Georgina apparently experienced her first symptoms after an episode in a movie theatre where she suddenly felt as if the darkness had surrounded her completely. It is not clear what the immediate reason for her diagnosis is. She also has a boyfriend in the hospital named Wade. 
;Lisa Cody
:Lisa is admitted to the ward after Susanna, and from her first days there she looks up to Lisa Rowe. She, too, is diagnosed as a sociopath, though Rowe questions this and is clearly annoyed that she is no longer the only sociopath there. A former drug addict like Rowe, she tries hard to defend herself from Lisa Rowe's accusations that she isn't "real". She eventually escapes and is apparently found by Lisa Rowe during one of her escapes from the hospital. Lisa tells the other girls with pride that Lisa Cody has become a "real" drug addict. Her fate after her escape is not described any further.
;Daisy Randone
:Daisy is a thin girl who arrives before Thanksgiving each year, staying through Christmas. She has a single room, where she spends most of her time. The other girls think she is addicted to [[laxatives]]. She eats only chicken, and does so only in her room. However, after letting Lisa into her room, Lisa reports back to the rest of them that she only needs the laxatives because of all of the chicken. She peels off the meat and keeps the carcasses, saying that when she has 14 carcasses, it's time to leave the hospital, possibly due to [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]]. Daisy's father visits her quite often, and it is implied he has [[incest]]uous feelings for her. Daisy eventually commits suicide on her birthday. Susanna describes her as "sexy" and says Daisy had a spark that the rest of the girls lack. Daisy is reclusive and often refuses to be social. She hates it when anyone goes near her and is hostile when people approach her. However, she does allow Lisa to enter her room. Sometimes they even share cigarettes, indicating that Daisy does respect Lisa out of all the other patients on the ward.
;Torrey
:Torrey is a former drug addict. She was put into the ward after her parents discovered her promiscuity. She is the best friend of all the fellow patients. Her parents take her out against her will, and take her back to [[Mexico]], where she believes she will become an [[amphetamine]] addict again. She describes Mexico, saying "being in Mexico means being dead and shooting speed to feel like you're not quite dead" (Kaysen, 97). The girls do try to help her with an escape plan and pool their money for her to help her, but eventually that plan is ruined, partly by Torrey herself, as she is too afraid to do it, and partly by Valerie after she gives Torrey a cup of [[thorazine]] just prior to her departure to calm her down. Though she only appears for a short time she is an important character. Kaysen distinguishes between those put there indefinitely by parents willing to pay without questioning the progress of their treatment and those whose parents are not willing to do so. Torrey is used as an example of the latter group.
;Alice Calais
:At first Alice seems quiet and, in Kaysen's words, "not too crazy"; but after about a month she breaks down and is taken to maximum security. When the girls go to visit her they find that she has painted herself and the walls in her seclusion room with her own feces. Most of the other patients believe she was "raised in a closet" because she is ignorant about the trivial things in life. For example, she has never tasted honey and doesn't know how it tastes. She is also completely unaware that her last name is a [[Calais|well-known location in France]] and is overwhelmed in awe when she hears of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. It is not explained what happens to her after the girls visit her.
;Wade
:Wade, Georgina's boyfriend, is also a patient. Wade entertains the female patients with stories about his father, who he claims to be a CIA agent. He is prone to violent outbursts, which eventually results in his being moved to the maximum-security ward.
;Cynthia Crowley
:A severely depressive patient who undergoes weekly [[electroconvulsive therapy]].&lt;ref name=Virago/&gt; There are only a few references to her in the book and she isn't a major character in it.

;Valerie
:The head nurse on  the ward. She works there during the day and though she can be strict she is generally liked by the patients and Kaysen in particular. She is described as down to earth and rarely uses the psychiatric terms used by the therapists, which is something that Susanna herself despises. Kaysen recalls her as honest and direct. 
;Mrs. McWeeney
:The evening nurse on the ward. Described as the exact opposite of Valerie and very much disliked by the patients. Kaysen recalls her as "clearly nuts". Valerie does not like her and tends to ignore her, although she does describe her as a professional when the patients complain to her. Although the patients don't like her, they recognize that she needs to earn a living and that she has to work somewhere for that to happen.
;Dr. Wick
:The [[consultant psychiatrist]]. She is described as very old-fashioned and easy to embarrass. Susanna purposely tries to embarrass her, deliberately saying things that she knows Dr. Wick will react to, during their sessions together. She has previously worked in Africa and her direct contact with the patients is very limited, talking to them for only a matter of minutes in a session.
;Melvin
:Kaysen's late therapist and analyst. Susanna says that the two of them used to be good friends and that she once enjoyed sessions with him. According to her, he was old, balding, and slightly unattractive. Susanna would go into his office sometimes and just sit there in silence because there wasn't very much silence in the hospital and she needed a break. However, this relationship was short-lived; Melvin rolled into the hospital parking lot, and, when greeted enthusiastically by Susanna, refused to entertain her. Her opinion of him spiraled downward from that point.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1603">In the sociology of agriculture, the '''Goldschmidt Thesis''' is the thesis by [[Walter Goldschmidt]] that [[farm scale]] and other management characteristics (e.g., [[wage labor]]) are associated with certain community characteristics. Goldschmidt was a California anthropologist who conducted pioneering rural community research under USDA’s [[Bureau of Agricultural Economics]] on two California farming communities (Arvin and Dinuba). His 1944 research showed that largescale, especially industrial, farm structures in one community were associated with adverse community conditions. Smaller-scale, owner-operated farms in the other community, were associated with more vibrant, diverse economies and with higher standards of living.

A large body of research has accumulated testing the Goldschmidt Thesis. However, the validity of the thesis that farm structural characteristics dominating an area can produce certain rural community characteristics remains ambiguous. Research results supporting the thesis and other conclusions casting doubt on it have characterized the debate for over 50 years.

{{Jewish philosophy|Topics}}
'''Happiness in [[Judaism]]''' and [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish thought]] is considered an important value, especially in the context of [[avodat Hashem|the service of God]].&lt;ref name=happyyankel&gt;Yanklowitz, Shmuly. [http://www.jewishjournal.com/bloggish/item/judaisms_value_of_happiness_living_with_gratitude_and_idealism_20120309 "Judaism's value of happiness living with gratitude and idealism."] Bloggish. ''The Jewish Journal''. March 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Jewish teachings stress the importance of joy, and demonstrate methods of attaining happiness.

==Terminology==
There are a number of words in the [[Hebrew language]] that denote happiness:
* ''[[Simcha]]'' ({{lang-he|שמחה}}), a generic word for happiness,&lt;ref name=happyyankel/&gt; also used to describe a celebration (e.g. a wedding, bar/bat mitzvah), it is also a name for both males and females
* ''Osher'' ({{lang-he|אושר}}), a "deeper, lasting happiness"&lt;ref&gt;Saltzman, Sonia. [http://www.ohabei.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Pursuit-of-Holiness-RH-day-1.pdf "The Pursuit of Holiness."] ''Ohabei.org''. Rosh Hashanah, 2013. Accessed November 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Orah'' ({{lang-he|אורה}}), a word used to mean both "light" and "happiness"
* ''Gila'' ({{lang-he|גילה}}), a term that may specifically refer to an exuberant outburst of joy&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Avraham Isaac HaKohen Kook. ''Ein Eyah'' vol I, page 128.&lt;/ref&gt; or the "happiness of discovery"&lt;ref name=happyyankel/&gt;
* ''Rina'' ({{lang-he|רינה}}), a term used to describe a "refreshing happiness"&lt;ref name=happyyankel/&gt;
* ''Ditza'' ({{lang-he|דיצה}}), a "sublime joy"&lt;ref name=happyyankel/&gt;
* ''Sasson'' ({{lang-he|ששון}}), a "sudden unexpected happiness"&lt;ref name=happyyankel/&gt;
* ''Tzahala'' ({{lang-he|צהלה}}), a word used for both "happiness" and "dancing"&lt;ref name=happyyankel/&gt;
* ''Chedva'' ({{lang-he|חדבה}}), a word denoting the "happiness of togetherness"&lt;ref name=happyyankel/&gt;

==Tanach==
The bible links happiness and joy in the context of the [[Avodat Hashem|service of God]].&lt;ref name=epis44&gt;Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov.

Accessed November 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Avraham Isaac HaKohen Kook. ''Olat Re'iyah'', vol. I, pp. 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Worship The Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful song.|''Psalms'', 100:2.}}

[[Ecclesiastes]] points to the futility of seeking joy and pleasure in life, however, the Talmud comments that this is only true of joy which has not been derived from the fulfilment of a commandment.&lt;ref&gt;''Talmud, Tractate Shabbos'', 30b.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I said to myself, "Come now, I will mix with joy and experience pleasure", and behold, it too was vanity. Of laughter, I said, "It is mirth" and concerning joy, "What does it accomplish?"|''Ecclesiastes'', 2:1-2.}}

Elsewhere, the bible links happiness to finding the right answer to a question.&lt;ref&gt;Shuchat, Wilfred. [http://www.books.google.com.au/books?id=5ZtBbylBQZQC&amp;pg=PA114 ''The Creation According to the Midrash Rabbah''.] Devora Publishing. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|To make an apt answer is a joy to a man, and a word in season, how good it is!|''Proverbs'', 15:23.}}

==Halacha==
In the [[Talmud]], one of the primary sources for traditional [[Jewish Law]] (''Halacha''), happiness and sadness are associated with particular months of in the [[Jewish calendar]]. One is meant to increase in happiness during the [[Adar (month)|month of Adar]] and decrease in happiness during the [[Av (month)|month of Av]].&lt;ref&gt;''Talmud, Tractate Ta'anis'' 29a.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Talmud, Tractate Ta'anis'' 26b.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in both [[Maimonides]]'s main legal work and the [[Code of Jewish Law]] by Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]], the decrease in joy during Av is mentioned while the increase during Adar is omitted. Some commentaries ascribe this omission to the fact that happiness has no concrete guidelines and depends on the nature of each individual. Whereas acts of sadness and mourning where required by law requires specification and delineation.&lt;ref&gt;''Nimukei Orach Chaim, Piskei Tshuvos'', Chapter 686, fn 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revach.net/tefila/article.php?id=4390 "Rambam &amp; Shulchan Aruch, What Happened To Halachic Happiness In Adar?"] ''revach.net''. Revach L'tefila. Accessed November 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; And though happiness during Adar isn't mentioned in the main Codes, it is mentioned by the ''[[Magen Avraham]]'', one of the main commentaries published alongside Karo's work written by Rabbi [[Avraham Gombiner]], and in ''[[Shlomo Ganzfried#Kitzur Shulchan Aruch|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]]'' (the "Abbreviated Code of Jewish Law") by Rabbi [[Shlomo Ganzfried]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torahlab.org/doitright/mishenichnas_adar_marbim_bsimcha/ "Mishenichnas Adar Marbim B’Simcha."] ''torahlab.org''. Tuesday, February 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Minhag|Jewish custom]] to hang a sign in one's home on which is written "When Adar comes in, increase in happiness" (''Mishenichnas Adar marbin b'simcha'', {{lang-he|משנכנס אדר מרבין בשמחה}}). Some have the custom to place this sign to cover the customary portion of a wall left unfinished serving the memory of the destruction of the [[Beis Hamikdash|Temple in Jerusalem]] (this wall area is commonly referred to as the ''zecher l'churban'').&lt;ref&gt;''Yalkut Avraham'' 686&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Piskei Tshuvos'' 686:5.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maimonides, happiness is an essential element in the performance of Jewish rituals. Maimonides rules in his Code, ''[[Yad Hachazakah]]'', that the performance of all commandments must accompany an abundance of joy.&lt;ref name=epis44/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Yad Hachazakah'', Hilchot Lulav 8:15.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The joy that a person takes in performing a mitzvah and in loving God Who commanded it is itself a great [divine] service.|Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', Laws of the Lulav 8:15.}}

In Jewish Law, rejoicing during the [[Jewish holidays]] is considered a biblical commandment. Maimonides ruled that this obligation is fulfilled by drinking wine and eating meat.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Alfred S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BnFaZE-Q1JMC&amp;pg=PA295 "Vegetarianism from a Jewish Perspective." ''Halacha and Contemporary Society'']. KTAV Publishing House. 1984. Page 295-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Talmud]] states "One should not stand up to pray while immersed in sorrow, or idleness, or laughter, or chatter, or frivolity, or idle talk, but only while rejoicing in the performance of a commandment (''b'simcha shel mitzvah'')."&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, Ronald L. [http://www.books.google.com.au/books?id=_qGHi_9K154C&amp;pg=PA524 ''Jewish Traditions: A JPS Guide'']. Jewish Publication Society, 2010. Page 524.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Talmud, Tractate Berachos'', 31a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some rabbinic commentaries have taught that joy may resolve doubts one may have in reaching a legal decision in Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;''Metzudas Dovid al Mishlei'', Ch. 15, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pri Megadim al Orach Chaim'', 670, 682.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spitz, Yehuda. [http://www.ohr.edu/this_week/insights_into_halacha/5744 "A Tale of Two Adars: Computations and Complications."] ''ohr.edu''. Ohr Sameach. March 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aggadah==

===Happiness and prophecy===
The Talmud, in an [[Aggadah|Aggadic]] (homiletic) teaching, states that the [[Shechina|Divine presence]] does not rest on a prophet unless he is in a state of happiness as the result of fulfilling one of the commandments.

{{quote|This teaches you that the Divine Presence rests upon man neither through gloom, nor through sloth, nor through frivolity, nor through levity, nor through talk, nor through idle chatter, save through a matter of joy in connection with a mitzvah.|''Talmud, Tractate Shabbos'', 30b.}}

===Happiness and marriage===
[[File:Gottlieb-Jewish Wedding sketch.jpg|200px|thumb|''Jewish Wedding'' (sketch), by [[Maurycy Gottlieb]] (1856–1879)]]
The Talmud and [[Midrash]] also associate joy with marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Shuchat, Wilfred. [http://www.books.google.com.au/books?id=FOApKeoeBgkC&amp;pg=PA273 ''The Garden of Eden &amp; the Struggle to be Human: According to the Midrash Rabbah'']. Devora Publishing. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Any man who has no wife lives without joy, without blessing, and without goodness.|''Talmud, Tractate Yevamoth'', 62a.}}

===Happiness and politics===
Elsewhere the Midrash emphasises joy as an effect of the state and nature of local governments.&lt;ref&gt;Neusner, Jacob. [http://www.books.google.com.au/books?id=he6RmcfmztQC&amp;pg=PA110 ''A Theological Commentary to the Midrash: Ruth Rabbah and Esther'']. University of America Press. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|When the righteous achieve great power, there is joy in the world, and when the wicked achieve great power, there is groaning in the world.|''Midrash Rabbah, Esther'', IV:i.}}

==Kabbalah==
The [[Zohar]], a central text in [[Kabbalah]], states that in order for Man's service of God to be complete, it must be completed in a joyful manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47204&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=12 ''Hasimcha B'aspeklarya Hayahadus''.] Dvar Yerushalayim. Beit Shemesh: Jerusalem. 1989. Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zohar also notes that the Hebrew word for "in happiness" (''b'simcha'', {{lang-he|בשמחה}}) contains the same letters as the Hebrew word for "thought" (''machshava'', {{lang-he|מחשבה}}).&lt;ref&gt;Glazerson, Matityahu. ''Torah, Light, and Healing''. Page 157.&lt;/ref&gt; This is understood to mean that the key to happiness is found through our minds, by training oneself to weed out any negative thought that prevent one from experiencing happiness.&lt;ref name=5greenways&gt;Green, Michael. [http://www.rabbimichaelgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/5-Ways-Chapter1.pdf "The Spirituality of a Smile."] ''5 Ways to Increase Your Spirituality''. Lulu.com. Accessed November 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kabbalist Rabbi [[Elazar ben Moshe Azikri]] stated “Though a person may be depressed on account of his sins, he must be joyful at the time of Divine service. This applies to every service of God, and how much more so then to the service of prayer which is called ‘the service of the heart.'"&lt;ref name=epis44/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Chareidim'', "Mitzvat Hateshuvah", ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Yitzchak Luria]], the Arizal, is believed to have only received his wisdom due to his rejoicing in the mitzvoth.&lt;ref name=beshthappy/&gt;{{RP|1:159}}

==Hasidism==
Joy is considered an essential element of the [[Hasidic]] way of life. In the early stages of the Hasidic movement, before the name "Hasidim" was coined, one of the names used to refer to the followers of the new movement was ''di freilicha'' ({{lang-yi|די פרייליכע}}), “the happy ones.”&lt;ref name=majesky1&gt;Majesky, Shloma. [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/88576/jewish/Chapter-1-Understanding-The-Core-of-Joy.htm "Understanding, The Core of Joy."] ''The Chassidic Approach to Joy''. Sichos in English. Brooklyn: New York. Accessed November 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Klezmer musicians in Jerusalem 2013-11-20 01-12.jpg|thumb|250px|Klezmer musicians in Jerusalem]]

The founder of Hasidism, Rabbi [[Yisroel Baal Shem Tov]] (1698–1760) is quoted as saying "In the eyes of the Hasidim, joy is considered a biblical commandment, a mitzvah."&lt;ref name=5greenways/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Yisroel Baal Shem Tov, ''Keter Shem Tov'', Hosafot, Chapter 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hasidic Rebbe, Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]] (1772–1810) would often say "It is a great mitzvah (commandment) to live in the state of happiness" (''mitzvah gedolah lihiyot b'simcha tamid'', {{lang-he|מצוה גדולה להיות בשמחה תמיד}}).&lt;ref name=5greenways/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, ''Likkutei Maharan'', Part 2:24.&lt;/ref&gt; And Rabbi [[Aharon of Karlin (I)]], one of the early Hasidic masters, reportedly said, "There is no mitzvah to be joyous, but joy can bring on the greatest mitzvot." It is also true, he said, that "it is not a sin to be sad, but sadness can bring on the greatest sins."&lt;ref name=happyyankel/&gt;

The Baal Shem Tov interprets the verse "Serve God with happiness", that "The happiness itself is your service of God".&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Tzvi. [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1303177/jewish/Just-Happy.htm "Just Happy."] ''Bringing Heaven Down To Earth''. Class One Press. Accessed November 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the teachings of Rabbi [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], the founder of [[Chabad]] Hasidism, happiness is believed to be an essential element in the struggle between the Godly and Animal souls. When a person is sad or depressed, they are likely to feel lethargic and unable to control negative impulses. By contrast, one who is happy is likely to feel energized and motivated to control oneself.&lt;ref name=tanya26&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/475953/jewish/On-Sadness-and-Joy.htm "Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi on Sadness and Joy."] Joy: An Anthology. ''Chabad.org''. Accessed November 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Just as it is with a victory over a physical opponent--for instance, two people who wrestle with each other, each striving to fell the other, if one of them is lazy and sluggish he will easily be defeated and will fall, even if he be stronger than the other--so it is with the conquest of one's evil nature: it is impossible to conquer the evil nature with laziness and sluggishness, which stem from sadness and a stone-like dullness of the heart, but rather with alacrity, which derives from joy and an open heart that is unblemished by any trace of worry and sadness in the world.|Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, ''[[Tanya]]'', Chapter 26.&lt;ref name=tanya26/&gt;}}

The third Chabad Rebbe, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneersohn]] of Lubavitch taught that a person should be happy and remain in good spirits despite any lack in ''[[yirat shamayim]]'' ("fear of heaven"). Though one might consider his/herself wicked and feel he or she deserves some form of divine punishment, one should see no conflict in feeling "happiness... from one side, and bitterness [over his or her spiritual state] from the other side".&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Tzvi. [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1411422/jewish/Guilt-Happiness.htm "Guilt &amp; Happiness—Let the ecstasy override all else."] Joy: An Anthology. ''Chabad.org''. Accessed November 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn of Lubavitch, ''Kitzurim V'ha-arot L'tanya'', page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Hasidic rebbe, Rabbi [[Moshe Leib of Sassov]] (1745–1807), a prayer filled with joy is greater than a prayer filled with tears. Quoting the Talmudic saying "The gates of tears are never locked", Rabbi Moshe states that for tears, the supernal gates are simply unlocked, while joy has the ability to destroy the gates completely.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Moshe Leib of Sassov, ''Likutei Ramal'', "Parshat Vayetsei."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baal Shem Tov taught that prayer conducted with joy is greater than prayer conducted with tears.&lt;ref name=beshthappy&gt;Rabbi Yisroel Baal Shem Tov. ''Sefer Baal Shem Tov''. Colel Bais Yosef. Melbourne: Australia. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|1:185}} The Baal Shem also taught that when the Tzadikim of the generation are joyful they awaken joy in the entire world,&lt;ref name=beshthappy/&gt;{{RP|2:349}} and that anger is dispelled by an emphasis on love for God and joy in performing the commandments.&lt;ref name=beshthappy/&gt;{{RP|1:326}}

==Mussar==
According to Rabbi [[Yisroel Salanter]], founder of the [[Mussar movement]], a person may be able to conquer and rectify one's negative impulses by being joyful in his or her service to God.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Yisroel Salanter. [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_31377_29.pdf ''Sefer Imrei Binah, Kevutzas Maamarim.''] Warsaw. 1878. Page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rabbi Naftali Amsterdam "Mussar study in ecstasy (''b'hispaalus'') renews the heart and gives joy to the soul."&lt;ref&gt;Etkes, Immanuel. [http://www.books.google.com.au/books?id=Z82oW1OUXAsC&amp;pg=PA105 ''Rabbi Israel Salanter and the Mussar Movement: Seeking the Torah of Truth.''] Jewish Publication Society, 1993. Page 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rabbi [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]] "There is no happiness in the world of material things; there is only happiness in spiritual concerns. The one who enjoys a rich spiritual life is happy. There is no other kind of happiness in existence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jhfweb.org/pursuit.pdf "Pursuit of Happiness."] ''jhfweb.org''. Jewish Heritage Foundation. Accessed November 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other rabbinic sources==
Rabbi Chaim Volozhin taught "A person in a joyful mood can learn more in an hour than a depressed person can learn in many hours."&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Chaim Volozhin. ''Ruach Chaim (commentary to Pirkei Avot)''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myerson, Marlene. [http://www.reformjudaism.org/happiness-middah-simchah "Happiness - Middah Simchah."] ''ReformJudaism.org''. Accessed December 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
According to Rabbi [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], the first Chabad Rebbe, one may attain joy by thinking deeply and picturing in one's mind the subject of the [[God in Judaism#Monotheism|unity of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, ''Tanya'', ch. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneersohn]], the third Chabad Rebbe, by assuming the demeanor and mannerisms of one who is joyful, even if the one practicing these actions does not feel happy, such behaviors will lead to true feelings of happiness, because behaviors and actions impact the heart.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, ''Igrot Kodesh'', Kehot Publication Society, Brooklyn: New York, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]], forcing oneself to be happy leads to truly feeling happy. According to Rabbi Nachman, even a faked, ungenuine, happiness has the power to transform one's personal situation and lead him or her to experiencing genuine joy.&lt;ref&gt;Maimon, Nasan.

'''Heliciculture''', also known as '''heliculture''', commonly known as  '''snail farming''', is the process of raising [[land snail]]s specifically for human use, either to use their flesh as edible [[escargot]] or, more recently, to obtain [[snail slime]] for use in [[cosmetics]] and [[Snail caviar|snail eggs]] for human consumption as a type of caviar.

Perhaps the best known edible land snail species in the [[Western world]] is ''[[Helix pomatia]]'' (also known as [[Roman snail]] or [[Burgundy snail]]). This snail is located throughout much of [[Europe]]. ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' (also known as ''Helix aspersa''), the next most known, were found originally in the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean region]], but are now also common in many parts of [[North America]], [[Central America]], and [[Australasia]].

== History ==
Roasted snail shells have been found in [[archaeological]] excavations, an indication that snails have been eaten since prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~dlubell/Antibes.pdf Prehistoric edible land snails in the circum-Mediterranean: the archaeological evidence.], D. Lubell. In J-J. Brugal &amp; J. Desse (eds.), ''Petits Animaux et Sociétés Humaines. Du Complément Alimentaire Aux Ressources Utilitaires''. XXIVe rencontres internationales d'archéologie et d'histoire d'Antibes, pp. 77-98. Antibes: Éditions APDCA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~dlubell/Ljubljana.pdf Are land snails a signature for the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition?] In, M. Budja (ed.), ''Neolithic Studies 11. Documenta Praehistorica XXXI'': 1-24. D. Lubell.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lumaca romana'', (translation: Roman snail), was an ancient method of snail farming or heliciculture in the region about [[Tarquinia]]. This snail farming method was described by [[:la:Quintus Fulvius Lippinus|Fulvius Lippinus]] (49 BC) and mentioned by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in ''De Re rustica'' III, 12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/3*.html#12 De Re Rustica III, 12]&lt;/ref&gt; The snails were fattened for human consumption using [[spelt]] and aromatic herbs. People usually raised snails in pens near the house, and these pens were called "[[:la:Cochlea (animal)|cochlea]]".

The Romans, in particular, are known to have considered escargot as an elite food, as noted in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. The Romans selected the best snails for breeding. Shells of the edible land snail species ''[[Otala lactea]]'' have been recovered in [[archaeological]] excavations of [[Volubilis]] in present-day [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, ''Volubilis'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham (2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described the snail garden of [[Fulvius Hirpinus]] 2,000 years ago as having separate sections for different species of snails. [[Hirpinus]] allegedly fed his snails on meal and wine.

"Wall fish" were also often eaten in Britain, but were never as popular as on the continent. There, people often ate snails during [[Lent]], and in a few places, they consumed large quantities of snails at Mardi Gras or Carnival, as a foretaste of Lent.

According to some sources, the French exported [[Helix aspersa|brown garden snails]] to California in the 1850s, raising them as the delicacy [[escargot]]. Other sources claim that Italian immigrants were the first to bring the snail to the United States.

== Economic impact ==
U.S. imports of snails were worth more than $4.5 million in 1995 and came from 24 countries. This includes preserved or prepared snails and snails that are live, fresh, chilled, or frozen. Major exporters to the U.S. are [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Greece]] and [[China]]. The U.S. exported live, fresh, chilled, or frozen snails worth $55,000 to 13 countries; most were shipped to [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Individual statistics are not available for U.S. exports of prepared or processed snails from the U.S. [[Department of Commerce]].

== List of edible land snail species ==
[[File:Snails-Italy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Three different species of snails for sale in a market in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]]]
Edible land snails range in size from about one millimeter long to the giant African snails, which occasionally grow up to {{convert|312|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in length. "Escargot" most commonly refers to either ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' or to ''[[Helix pomatia]]'', although other varieties of snails are eaten. ''[[Achatina fulica]]'', a giant African snail, is sliced and [[Canning|canned]] and passed off on some consumers as escargot. Terms such as "garden snail" or "common brown garden snail" are rather meaningless since they refer to so many types of snails, but they sometimes mean ''H. aspersa''.
* ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' is also known as the French "petit gris," "small grey snail," the "escargot chagrine," or "la zigrinata." The shell of a mature adult has four to five whorls and measures 30 to 45&amp;nbsp;mm across. It is native to the shores of the Mediterranean and up the coast of Spain and France. It is found on many British Isles, where the Romans introduced it in the 1st century AD (Some references say it dates to the Early Bronze Age.) In the early 19th century the French brought it into California, where it has become a serious pest. These snails are now common throughout the U.S. It was introduced into several Eastern and Gulf states even before 1850 and, later introduced into other countries such as Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico, and Argentina. ''C. aspersum'' has a life span of 2 to 5 years. This species is more adaptable to different climates and conditions than many snails, and is found in woods, fields, sand dunes, and gardens. This adaptability not only increases ''C. aspersum's'' range, but it also makes farming ''C. aspersum'' easier and less risky.
* ''[[Helix pomatia]]'' measures about 45&amp;nbsp;mm across the shell. It also is called the "Roman snail," "apple snail," "lunar," "la vignaiola," the German "Weinbergschnecke," the French "escargot de Bourgogne" or "Burgundy snail," or "gros blanc." Native over a large part of Europe, it lives in wooded mountains and valleys up to {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} altitude and in vineyards and gardens. The Romans may have introduced it into Britain. Immigrants introduced it into the U.S. in Michigan and Wisconsin. Many prefer ''H. pomatia'' to ''H. aspersa'' for its flavor and its larger size, as the "escargot par excellence."
* ''[[Otala lactea]]'' is sometimes called the "vineyard snail," "milk snail," or "Spanish snail." The shell is white with reddish brown spiral bands and measures about 26 to 35&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.
* ''[[Iberus alonensis]]'', the Spanish "vaqueta" or "serrana", measures about 30&amp;nbsp;mm across the shell.
[[File:Cepaea nemoralis pair banded shells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'']]
* ''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'', the "grove snail," or the Spanish "vaqueta", measures about 25&amp;nbsp;mm across the shell. It inhabits Central Europe and was introduced into, and is now naturalized in many U.S. states, from Massachusetts to California, and from Tennessee to Canada. Its habitat ranges widely from woods to dunes. It mainly eats dead plant material, but it likes nettles and buttercups and will eat dead worms and dead snails.
* ''[[Cepaea hortensis]]'', the "white-lipped snail", measures about 20&amp;nbsp;mm across the shell which often has distinct dark stripes. It is native to central and northern Europe. This species was introduced into Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire in colonial times, but it never became established in these states. Its habitat varies but ''C. hortensis'' is found in colder and wetter places than ''C. nemoralis''. Their smaller size and some people's opinion that they do not taste as good make ''C. hortensis'' and ''C. nemoralis'' less popular than the larger European land snails.
* ''[[Otala punctata]]'', called "vaqueta" in some parts of Spain, measures about 35&amp;nbsp;mm across the shell.
* ''[[Eobania vermiculata]]'', the "vinyala," "mongeta," or "xona", measures about 25&amp;nbsp;mm. It is found in Mediterranean countries and was introduced into Louisiana and Texas.
* ''[[Helix lucorum]]'', sometimes called "escargo turc," measures about 45&amp;nbsp;mm across the shell. It is found in central Italy and from Yugoslavia through the Crimea to Turkey and around the Black Sea.
* ''[[Helix adanensis]]'' comes from around Turkey.
* ''[[Helix aperta]]'' measures about 25&amp;nbsp;mm. Its meat is highly prized. It is native to France, Italy, and other Mediterranean countries and has become established in California and Louisiana. Sometimes known as the "burrowing snail," it is found above ground only during rainy weather. In hot, dry weather, it burrows three to six inches into the ground and becomes dormant until rain softens the soil.
* ''[[Theba pisana]]'', also called the "banded snail"or the "cargol avellanenc", measures about 20&amp;nbsp;mm and lives on dry, exposed sites, usually near the sea. Native to Sicily, it has been spread to several European countries, including England. This snail is a serious garden pest and is the "white snail" that California once eradicated by using flamethrowers to burn off whole areas. In large numbers, up to 3,000 snails per tree, it can ravage a garden in 24 hours and a citrus or other crop in a couple of nights.
* ''[[Sphincterochila candidissima]]'' or ''[[Leucochroa candidisima]]'', the "cargol mongeta," or "cargol jueu" measures about 20&amp;nbsp;mm.
[[File:Achatina fulica Thailand.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[Achatina fulica]]'']]
* ''[[Achatina fulica]]'' and other ''Achatina'' species, giant African snails. They can grow up to 326&amp;nbsp;mm (1&amp;nbsp;ft ¾ in) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was purposely introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other Pacific locations and was inadvertently released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North Miami Florida in the 1970s. In many places, it is a serious agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odor that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die. The U.S. has made considerable effort to eradicate ''Achatina''. The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live Giant African snails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/29/illegal-giant-snails-threatening-america/|title=Illegal giant snails threatening America|date=2014-08-29|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are still sought after as pets due to the vibrant "tiger stripes" on their shells.

== Mating and egg laying ==

=== General ===
Snails are [[hermaphrodite]]s. Although they have both male and female [[reproductive organ]]s, they must mate with another snail of the same species before they lay eggs. Some snails may act as males one season and as females the next. Other snails play both roles at once and [[fertilize]] each other simultaneously. When the snail is large enough and mature enough, which may take several years, mating occurs in the late spring or early summer after several hours of [[courtship]]. Sometimes there is a second mating in summer. (In tropical climates, mating may occur several times a year. In some climates, snails mate around October and may mate a second time 2 weeks later.) After mating, the snail can store sperm received for up to a year, but it usually lays eggs within a few weeks. Snails are sometimes uninterested in mating with another snail of the same species that originated from a considerable distance away. For example, a ''H. aspersa'' from southern France may reject a ''H. aspersa'' from northern France.

=== ''Helix pomatia'' ===
Snails need soil at least 2&amp;nbsp;inches deep in which to lay their eggs. For ''H. pomatia'', the soil should be at least 3&amp;nbsp;inches deep to keep out pests such as [[ants]], [[earwig]]s, [[millipede]]s, etc. Dry soil is not suitable for the preparation of a nest, nor is soil that is too heavy. In clay soil that becomes hard, reproduction rates may decrease because the snails are unable to bury their eggs and the hatchlings have difficulty emerging from the nest. Hatchability of eggs depends on soil temperature, soil humidity, soil composition, etc. Soil consisting of 20% to 40% organic material is good. The soil should be kept at {{convert|41|to|50|F|C}}, and is best around {{convert|70|°F|°C}}. Soil moisture should be maintained at 80%. One researcher removes eggs immediately after they are deposited, counts them, then keeps them on moist cotton until the eggs hatch and the young start to eat. Snails lose substantial weight by laying eggs. Some do not recover. About one-third of the snails will die after the breeding season.

''H. pomatia'' eggs measure about 3&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and have a [[calcareous]] shell and a high [[yolk]] content. ''H. pomatia'' lays the eggs in July or August, 2 to 8 weeks after mating, in holes dug out in the ground. (Data varies widely on how long after mating snails lay eggs.) The snail puts its head into the hole or may crawl in until only the top of the shell is visible; then it deposits eggs from the genital opening just behind the head. It takes the snail 1 to 2 days to lay 30 to 50 eggs. Occasionally, the snail will lay about a dozen more a few weeks later. The snail covers the hole with a mixture of the slime it excretes and dirt. This slime, which the snail excretes to help it crawl and to help preserve the moisture in its soft body, is [[glycoprotein]] similar to eggwhite.

Fully developed baby ''H. pomatia'' snails hatch about 3 to 4 weeks after the eggs are laid, depending on temperature and humidity. Birds, insects, mice, toads and other predators take a heavy toll on the young snails. The snails eat and grow until the weather turns cold. They then dig a deep hole, sometimes as deep as {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on}}, and seal themselves inside their shell and hibernate for the winter. This is a response to both decreasing temperature and shorter hours of daylight. When the ground warms up in spring, the snail emerges and goes on a binge of replacing lost moisture and eating.

=== ''Helix aspersa'' ===
''H. aspersa'' eggs are white, spherical, about 3&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and are laid 5 days to 3 weeks after mating. (Data varies widely due to differences in climate and regional variations in the snails' habitats.) ''H. aspersa'' lays an average of 85 eggs in a nest that is 1 to 1½ inches deep. Data varies from 30 to over 120 eggs, but high figures may be from when more than one snail lays eggs in the same nest.

In warm, damp climates, ''H. aspersa'' may lay eggs as often as five times from February through October, depending on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when there are at least 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures are still too cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days to break out of the sealed nest and climb to the surface. In a climate similar to southern California's, ''H. aspersa'' matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, ''H. aspersa'' hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at the start of the season will reach adult size and form a lip at the edge of their shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early [[hatchlings]], the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some ''H. aspersa'' mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of ''H. aspersa's'' reproductive activity takes place in the second year of its life.

=== ''Achatina fulica'' ===
By contrast, one giant African snail, ''Achatina fulica'', lays 100 to 400 [[elliptical]] eggs that each measure about 5&amp;nbsp;mm long. Each snail may lay several batches of eggs each year, usually in the wet season. They may lay eggs in holes in the ground like ''H. pomatia'', or lay eggs on the surface of a rocky soil, in organic matter, or at the base of plants. In 10 to 30 days, the eggs hatch releasing snails about 4&amp;nbsp;mm long. These snails grow up to 10&amp;nbsp;mm per month. After 6 months, the Achatina fulica is about 35&amp;nbsp;mm long and may already be sexually mature. [[Sexual maturity]] takes 6 to 16 months, depending on weather and the availability of [[calcium]]. This snail lives 5 or 6 years, sometimes as many as 9 years.

== Growth ==
Within the same snail population and under the same conditions, some snails will grow faster than others. Some will take twice as long to mature. This may help the species survive bad weather, etc., in the wild. However, a snail farmer should obviously select and keep the largest and fastest maturing snails for breeding stock and sell the smaller snails. By selecting only the largest, the average size of the snail may increase significantly in only a couple of generations. Most of the differences in growth are probably due to environmental factors including stocking density. However, to whatever extent these differences are genetic, farmers generally breed large, fast-growing snails instead of small, slower-growing ones.

Several factors can greatly influence the growth of snails including: population density, stress (snails are sensitive to noise, light, vibration, unsanitary conditions, irregular feedings, being touched, etc.), feed, temperature and moisture, and the breeding technology used.

''H. aspersa'' requires at least 3% to 4% calcium in the soil (or another source of calcium) for good growth. Most snails need more calcium in the soil than ''H. aspersa''. Low calcium intake will slow the growth rate and cause the shell to be thinner. Calcium may be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. Food is only one calcium source. Snails may eat paint or attack walls of buildings seeking calcium, and they also will eat dirt.

A newborn's shell size depends on the egg size since the shell develops from the egg's surface membrane. As the snail grows, the shell is added onto in increments. Eventually the shell will develop a flare or reinforcing lip at its opening. This shows that the snail is now mature; there will be no further shell growth. Growth is measured by shell size, since a snail's body weight varies and fluctuates, even in 100% humidity. The growth rate varies considerably between individuals in each population group. Adult size, which is related to the growth rate, also varies, thus the fastest growers are usually the largest snails. Eggs from larger, healthier snails also tend to grow faster and thus larger.

Dryness inhibits growth and even stops activity. When it becomes too hot and dry in summer, the snail becomes inactive, seals its shell and [[estivation|estivates]] (becomes dormant) until cooler, moister weather returns. Some snails estivate in groups on tree trunks, posts, or walls. They seal themselves to the surface, thus sealing up the shell opening.

Peak snail activity (including feeding and thus growth) occurs a few hours after sunset, when the temperature is lower and the water content (in the form of [[dew]]) is higher. During daytime snails usually seek shelter.

== Farming snails ==
Successful snail culture requires the correct equipment and supplies, including: [[snail pens]] or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity ([[hygrometer]]), temperature ([[thermometer]]), soil moisture ([[soil moisture sensor]]), and light (in foot candles); a weight scale and an instrument to measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and a magnifying glass to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate ([[temperature]] and [[humidity]]), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails of the same kind and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.

Four systems of snail farms can be distinguished:
* Outdoor pens.
* In buildings with a controlled climate.
* In closed systems such as plastic tunnel houses or "[[greenhouse]]s".
* In addition, snails may breed and hatch inside in a controlled environment and then (after 6 to 8 weeks) may be placed in outside pens to mature.

=== Favorable conditions ===

'''Climate''': A mild climate {{convert|15|-|25|C|F}} with high humidity (75% to 95%) is best for snail farming, though most varieties can stand a wider range of temperatures. The optimal temperature is {{convert|21|°C|°F}} for many varieties. When the temperature falls below {{convert|7|°C|°F}}, snails hibernate. Under {{convert|12|°C|°F}} the snails are inactive, and under {{convert|10|°C|°F}}, all growth stops. When the temperature rises much above {{convert|27|°C|°F}} or conditions become too dry, snails estivate. Wind is bad for snails because it speeds up moisture loss, and snails must retain moisture.

'''Moisture''': Snails thrive in damp but not waterlogged environments and thus a well-draining soil is required. Research indicates that water content around 80% of the carrying capacity of the soil and air [[humidity]] over 80% (during darkness) are the most favorable conditions. Many farmers use [[Aerosol spray|mist-producing devices]] to maintain proper moisture in the air and/or soil.&lt;ref&gt;http://publications.cta.int/publications/publication/1497/&lt;/ref&gt; Also, if the system contains alive vegetation, the leaves are to be periodically wet.

'''[[Soil]]''': Snails dig in soil and ingest it. Good soil favors snail growth and provides some of their nutrition. Lack of access to good soil may cause fragile shells even when the snails have well-balanced feed; the snails growth may lag far behind the growth of other snails on good soil. Snails will often eat feed, then go eat dirt. Sometimes, they will eat only one or the other.

A well-functional soil would have the following characteristics:
* Containing neither a lot of [[sand]] nor too much [[clay]], as snails strive to dig into hard clay and sand dries out easily.
* 20–40% organic matter content. Organic matter enhances [[cation exchange capacity]] of calcium and [[magnesium]] which in turn stimulates growth.
* [[pH]] around 7.
* Adequate [[calcium]], the primary constituent of shells (up to 98%). A common way to introduce calcium is to add ground [[limestone]] at a suggested concentration of 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg per {{convert|100|sqft|m2}}. Calcium may also be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. More advanced techniques involve the addition of [[polyacrylamide]] with the following concentration: 12.5&amp;nbsp;cm³ of a 160&amp;nbsp;g M.A./one preparation in 250 cc of water per kilogram of dry soil. Such stabilization treatment helps the soil structure resist washing and allows regular cleaning without destroying the crumb structure of the soil that is beneficial for egg laying.

Soil care: A farmer must find a way to prevent the soil from becoming fouled with mucus and droppings and also tackle undesirable [[Soil chemistry|chemical changes]] that may occur in time.

Soil mix suggestions:
* [[peat]], clay, [[compost]] and [[calcium carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]
* [[Leaf mold]] (at pH 7)

== Pens and enclosures ==

The U.S. [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] ([[APHIS]]) Standards for [[Snail-Rearing Facilities]] were revised March 2001 and are available on the APHIS website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aphis.usda.gov:80/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Enclosures for snails are usually long and thin instead of square. This allows the workers to walk around (without harming the snails) and reach into the whole pen. The enclosure may be a trough with sides made of [[wood]], [[Concrete masonry unit|block]], [[fiber cement sheets]], or [[galvanized]] [[sheet steel]]. Cover it with [[Sieve|screen]] or [[netting]]. The covering confines the snails and keeps out birds and other predators. Fences or walls are usually {{convert|2|ft|m}} high plus at least 5&amp;nbsp;inches into the ground. Fencing made of galvanized metal or hard-plastic sheets helps keep out some predators. A cover will protect against heavy rain. Shade (which may be a fine mesh screen) on warm winter days helps keep the snails dormant. 5&amp;nbsp;mm mesh or finer is used for pen screens or fences. Pens containing baby snails need a finer mesh.

Snails need hiding places, especially during the warm daytime. Plastic soil drainage pipes from the local [[garden center]] can be split in two lengthwise, and stacked one layer one way and the next layer at a right angle, providing shelter and also increasing by 50% the number of snails that can live in the pen.

A sprinkler system ensures moisture when needed and can be turned on at sunset rather than earlier in the day, when the moisture may drive snails out into hot sunshine. Temperature and humidity can be monitored using a thermometer and a hygrometer.

The bottom of the enclosure, if it is not the ground or trays of dirt, needs be a surface more solid than screening. A snail placed in a wire-mesh-bottom pen will keep crawling, trying to get off the wires and onto solid, more comfortable ground.

In order to prevent escapes, in an open pen, the top of the fences curve inward in a half circle; this works to confine the vineyard snail. However, ''H. aspersa'' can escape from such an open pen, and an electric fence may be needed to contain them. [The [[electric fence]] top has two or more thin wires that are 2 to 4&amp;nbsp;mm apart. Each wire carries the opposite charge of the wire next to it. A battery or transformer is used to supply 4 to 12 [[volt]]s to the wire. A snail will get a mild shock and retract when it crawls over a wire and touches a second wire.]

Another technique to confine snails is to bend the fence top inward into a sharp "V" shape with about a 20-degree angle. The snail's shell will hit the bent-back part of the screen before the snail can reach up and start crawling on it. This blocks the snail, and the angled screen automatically compensates for the size of the snail.

Another alternative, suitable for solid wall enclosures, is to attach to the wall a horizontal piece of screen that projects inward several inches over the enclosure. The screen is made with material such as nylon monofilament that is moderately stiff and springy yet easily flexible. On the inside edge of the screen, the cross fibers are removed, producing a fringe several inches wide. When a snail crawls on the underside of the screen and moves out onto the fringe, his weight pulls several individual fibers down. One by one, another fiber gets away from the snail and springs back up out of reach. Eventually the snail is dangling by a thread. The snail then falls, because the surface area is not big enough to crawl on.

Because snails usually will not cross a [[copper]] band, another solution is to top the fence with 3-inch-wide (or wider) copper band. The band can be bent so that part of it faces inward and is parallel to the pen floor. The band must not be placed very close to the ground, because rain may wash soil against the copper and leave a residue that may enable the snail to cross it. The bottom of the fence must be buried deep enough into the ground so that the snails cannot dig under it.

An alternate method is to make a square pen with a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}}-square garden in it. Plant about six crops, e.g., [[Urtica|nettles]] and [[artichoke]]s, inside the pen. The snails will choose what they want to eat. If it has not rained, turn sprinklers on for about 15 minutes at dusk, unless the snails are dormant. A disadvantage to this method is that, if the snails are not mature at the end of the year, it is difficult to replant fresh plant crops in the pens.

Plastic tunnels make cheap, easy snail enclosures, but it is difficult to regulate heat and humidity. The tunnel will be 10 to 20 degrees warmer than the outside, and snails become dormant when the temperature climbs above {{convert|80|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.

When snails are raised indoors under controlled conditions, reproduction varies according to the geographic origin of the [[breeding stock]]. For example, one researcher found that ''H. aspersa'' snails from [[Brittany]] seem to do better indoors than snails from another region. To breed snails indoors, the temperature needs to be kept at 70&amp;nbsp;°F and the relative humidity at 80% to 90%; some sources say 95%. Another source recommends 75% humidity by day and 95% at night. The [[Center for Heliciculture]] once recommended 65–75% humidity during the day and 85–95% at night at 68&amp;nbsp;°F. In any event, avoid humidity higher than 95% (some say 90%) for any length of time. Excessive humidity can kill snails. Optimum temperature and relative humidity depend on several things, including the snail variety and even where breeding stock was gathered. For ''H. aspersa'', the optimum temperature for hatching eggs seems to be {{convert|68|°F|°C|abbr=on}} at 100% relative humidity. The second best temperature/humidity combination depends on where the snails came from and results can drop drastically to 0% hatching at {{convert|17|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and 100% humidity. The soil must not be kept wet when the humidity is maintained at 100%, as the eggs will absorb water, swell up, and burst.

[[Fluorescent lamp]]s can be used to give artificial daylight. Different snails respond to day length in different ways. The ratio of light to darkness influences activity, feeding, and mating and egg-laying. Eighteen or more hours of light apparently stimulate ''H. aspersa'' growth, while less than 12 hours inhibit it. Some snail species may associates the long hours of light with the start of summer—the peak growing season. Eighteen hours of daylight also appear optimal for breeding (mating and egg laying), but snails will breed in darkness.

Snails can be bred in boxes or cages stacked several units high. An automatic sprinkler system can be used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a water trough. Plastic trays a couple of inches deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about 3&amp;nbsp;inches deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.)

When the snails have laid their eggs, the pots are put in a nursery where the eggs will hatch. The young snails are kept in the nursery for about 6 weeks, and then moved to a separate pen, as young snails do best if kept with other snails of similar size. Eight hours of daylight is optimal for young snails.

Baby snails are fed on tender [[lettuce]] leaves ([[Boston lettuce|Boston]] type, but [[head lettuce|head]] type is probably also good.)

Some who raise ''H. aspersa'' separate the five stages: reproduction, hatching, young, fattening, and final fattening.

In a typical example, the [[Reproduction|breeding]] box has [[concrete]] sides, soil with [[earthworm]]s (to cleanse the soil) on the bottom, vegetation, curved tiles to provide shelter, feeders, and a chicken waterer. [[Mosquito]] netting or screening covers the top. These breeding boxes may be outside, or better results may be obtained when the boxes are inside a greenhouse—as long as the greenhouse does not get too hot or too dry. One researcher reported that in outdoor boxes, each breeder snail had about seven young. In greenhouses, each breeder snail had about 9 to 12 young. The researcher felt that under better weather conditions than those he had that year, each adult breeder snail would have produced 15 young snails.

[[Fattening pens]] can be outside or in a greenhouse. High summer temperatures and insufficient moisture cause dwarfing and malformations of some snails. This is more a problem inside greenhouses if the sun overheats the building. A sprinkler system (e.g., a [[horticultural]] system or common lawn sprinklers) can supply moisture. Make sure excess water can drain.

Fattening pens may contain {{convert|2|by|3|ft|m|adj=on}} pieces (or other convenient size) of heavy plastic sheets, hung from boards resting on a rack that lets the tips of the plastic sheets just touch the ground. The plastic sheets are about 4&amp;nbsp;inches apart. The sheets give the snails a resting and hiding place. Feeders may be located on the rack that supports the plastic sheets.

A layer of coarse sand and topsoil with earthworms is placed on the fattening pen's bottom. The worms help clean up the snail droppings.

Snails that hatched the previous summer can be put in a chilled room for hibernation over winter. About 1 April, (adjusted for local climate), they are moved to the final fattening pen. IN cases where there are several fattening pens, the smaller snails are placed in one, medium in another, large in another. One-third of a pound of ''H. aspersa'' snails require one square foot of pen. Snails lose weight when they estivate in summer, therefore some growers do not stock pens by weight but by count. For ''H. aspersa'', 10 to 12 snails per square foot is the maximum.

== Cannibalism by hatchlings ==
The first snails to hatch eat the shells of their eggs. This gives them calcium needed for their shells. They may then begin eating unhatched eggs. If the snail eggs are kept at the optimum temperature, {{convert|68|°F|°C}} (for some varieties), and if none of the eggs lose moisture, most eggs will hatch within 1 to 3 days of each other. [[Cannibalism]] also will be low. If hatching extends over a longer period, cannibalism may increase. Some eggs eaten are eggs that were not fertile or did not develop properly, but sometimes, properly developing embryos might be eaten. A high density of "clutches" of egg masses increases the rate of cannibalism, as other nearby egg masses are more likely to be found and eaten. Snail egg has 12 to 20 times the protein of lettuce. The protein helps the baby snails start developing quickly and be healthier. Snail egg is an excellent starter food for newly hatched snails, but they tend to only eat eggs of their own species.

== Feeding ==
Feeding season is April through October, (or may vary with the local climate), with a "rest period" during the summer. Do not place food in one small clump so that there is not enough room for all the snails to get to it. Snails eat solid food by [[rasping]] it away with their [[radula]]. Feeding activity depends on the weather, and snails may not necessarily feed every day. Evening irrigation in dry weather may encourage feeding since the moisture makes it easier for the snails to move about.

Put the breeding snails in the breeding pens in April or early May. Feed until mid June when mating begins and the snails stop feeding. Snails resume eating after they lay eggs. Once snails have laid their eggs, the adult snails can be removed. This leaves more food and less crowding for the hatchlings.

Snails of the same species collected from different regions may have different food preferences. Some foods that snails eat are: [[Alyssum]], fruit and leaves of [[apple]], [[apricot]], [[artichoke]] (a favorite), [[Aster (genus)|aster]], [[barley]], [[beans]], [[bindweed]], [[California boxwood]], almost any [[cabbage]] variety, [[camomile]], [[carnation]], [[carrot]], [[cauliflower]], [[celeriac]] (root celery), [[celery]], ripe [[cherries]], [[chive]], citrus, [[clover]], [[cucumber]]s (a favorite snail food), [[dandelion]], [[Elderberry|elder]], [[henbane]], [[hibiscus]], [[hollyhock]], [[kale]], larkspur ([[Consolida]] or [[Delphinium]] genera), [[leek]], lettuce (liked, and makes good snails), [[lily]], [[magnolia]], [[mountain ash]], [[mulberry]], [[chrysanthemum]], [[Tropaeolum|nasturtium]], [[Urtica|nettle]], [[nightshade]] berries, [[oats]], [[onion]] greens, [[pansy]], [[parsley]], [[peach]], ripe [[pear]]s, [[pea]]s, [[petunia]], [[phlox]], [[plum]], [[potato]]es (raw or cooked), [[pumpkin]]s, [[radish]], [[rapeseed|rape]], [[rose]], [[sorrel]], [[spinach]], [[sweet pea]], [[thistle]], [[tomato]]es (well liked), [[turnip]], [[wheat]], [[yarrow]], [[zinnia]]. They will eat sweet [[lupin]]es, but will reject bitter [[lupin]]es and other plants with high [[quinolizidine]] [[alkaloid]]s. Snails also avoid plants that produce other defensive chemicals, defensive stem hairs, etc.

Snails usually prefer juicy leaves and vegetables over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed as it will quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% [[wheat bran]] while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use [[oats]], [[corn meal]], [[soybean meal]], or [[chicken]] mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed [[oyster]] shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their [[body weight]]. Active snails deprived of food will lose more than one-third of their weight before they starve to death—a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.

Supply calcium at least once a week if it is not available in the soil. It should not contain harmful salts or be so alkaline as to burn the snails. Mix calcium with wet bran or mashed potatoes and serve on a pan; this will keep any leftover food from rotting on the ground.

Some researchers use chicken mash for feed. A plastic pipe can be cut in half lengthwise to make two troughs which can be used as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).

Pellets are fine for larger snails, but mash is better for younger ones. Pellets should be partially crushed if fed to young snails. Snails do not grow well if rabbit pellets are their primary diet. Snails show a distinct preference for moist feed. Easy access to enough water must be ensured if snails are fed dry mash.

Be sure to frequently clean the feed and water dishes. The amount of feed a snail eats depends very much on air humidity and on the availability of drinking water. Clean drinking water can be served in a shallow container to reduce the risk of the snail drowning. Some types of chicken waterers may be suitable. Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.

Young ''H. aspersa'' readily eats [[milk powder]]. Its rapid rate of assimilation promotes rapid growth.

== Diseases and pests ==
Good hygiene can prevent the spread of disease and otherwise improve the health and growth rate of snails. Food is replaced daily in order to prevent spoilage. Earthworms added to the soil help keep the pen clean.

[[Parasitism|Parasites]], [[nematode]]s, [[trematoda|trematodes]], [[fungi]], and micro[[arthropod]]s can attack snails, and such problems can spread rapidly when snail populations are dense. The bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' causes intestinal infections that can spread rapidly in a crowded snail pen.

Possible predators include [[rat]]s, [[Mouse|mice]], [[Mole (animal)|moles]], [[skunk]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[bird]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[lizard]]s, walking insects (e.g., some [[beetle]] and [[cricket]] varieties), some types of [[Fly|flies]], [[centipede]]s, and even certain carnivorous snail species, such as ''[[Strangesta capillacea]]''.

== Population density ==
Population density also affects successful snail production. Pens should contain no more than six to eight fair-sized snails per square foot, or about four large ''H. pomatias''; or figure one kilogram per square meter (about .2 pounds of snail per square foot), which automatically compensates for the size of the snails. To encourage breeding, best results will occur with not more than eight snails per square meter (0.8 per square foot). Some sources say that, for ''H. pomatia'' to breed, 2 to 4 snails per square meter (0.2 to 0.4 per square foot) is the maximum.

Snails tend not to breed when packed too densely or when the [[wikt:slime|slime]] in the pen accumulates too much. The slime apparently works like a [[pheromone]] and suppresses reproduction. On the other hand, snails in groups of about 100 seem to breed better than when only a few snails are confined together. Perhaps they have more potential mates from which to choose. Snails in a densely populated area grow more slowly even when food is abundant, and they also have a higher mortality rate. These snails then become smaller adults who lay fewer clutches of eggs, have fewer eggs per clutch, and the eggs have a lower hatch rate. Smaller adult snails sell for less. [[Dwarfing]] is quite common in snail farming and is attributable mainly to rearing conditions rather than [[heredity]] factors. Crowding snails is false economy. A recommended rate for ''H. aspersa'' is not more than one-third pound per square foot (3.6&amp;nbsp;kg/m²) of soil surface for snails that weigh more than 1&amp;nbsp;gram and not more than 0.2 pound per square foot (2.2&amp;nbsp;kg/m²) for snails that weigh less. (One ounce is about 28&amp;nbsp;grams.)

== Turning snails into escargots ==
{{Main|Escargot}}
Snails are mature when a lip forms at the opening of their shell. Before they mature, their shells are more easily broken, making them undesirable. For ''H. aspersa'', commercial weight is 8&amp;nbsp;grams or larger. The nutrient composition of raw snails (per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of edible portion), according to information from the nutrient databank of France,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} is:
* [[Food energy|Energy]]: 80.5 [[calorie|kcal]] (337 [[kilojoule|kJ]])
* [[Water]]: 79 g
* [[Protein]]: 16 g
* Available [[carbohydrates]]: 2 g
* [[Fiber]]: 0 g
* [[Fat]]: 1 g
* [[Magnesium]]: 250&amp;nbsp;mg
* [[Calcium]]: 170&amp;nbsp;mg
* [[Iron]]: 3.5&amp;nbsp;mg
* [[Vitamin C]]: 0&amp;nbsp;mg

Snail eggs are also harvested and processed to produce [[snail caviar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2007-12-15-snail-caviar-the-new-gourmet-frontier |title=Snail caviar! The new gourmet frontier |publisher=''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]'' |date=December 15, 2007 |accessdate=21 January 2015 |author=Bertrand, Jordane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restrictions and regulations in the United States ==
The same snails that some people raise or gather as food also are agricultural pests that cause considerable crop damage. Introduced slug and snail varieties tend to be worse pests than native species, probably due in part to the lack of natural controls. Snail pests attack crops ranging from leafy vegetables to fruits that grow near the ground, such as strawberries and tomatoes, to citrus fruits high up on trees.

The [[Federal Plant Pest Act]] defines a plant pest as "any living stage (including active and dormant forms) of [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[protozoa]], or other [[invertebrate]] animals, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], other [[parasite|parasitic plants]] or reproductive parts thereof; viruses; or any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing; or any [[infection|infectious]] substances, which can directly or indirectly injure or cause disease or damage in or to any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants..." The [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) categorizes giant African snails as a "quarantine significant plant pest." The United States does not allow live giant African snails into the country under any circumstances. It is illegal to own or to possess them. APHIS vigorously enforces this regulation and destroys or returns these snails to their country of origin.

Since large infestations of snails can do devastating damage, many states have quarantines against nursery products, and other products, from infested states. Further, it is illegal to import snails (or slugs) into the U.S. without permission from the [[Plant Protection and Quarantine Division]] (PPQ), [[Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service]], U.S. Department of Agriculture. APHIS also oversees interstate transportation of snails. Anyone who plans to "import, release, or make interstate shipments of" snails, must complete APHIS's PPQ Form 526, Application and Permit to Move Live Plant Pests and Noxious Weeds. This form should be submitted to the State regulatory official. The state will process the request and make a recommendation to APHIS who will then make a decision.

Information on Plant Pest Permits is available at APHIS's website [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm].

The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates the canning of low-[[acid]] foods such as snails. According to FDA, "establishments engaged in the manufacture of Low-acid or Acidified Canned Foods (LACF) offered for interstate commerce in the United States are required...to register their facility...and file scheduled processes for their products with" the FDA. This does not refer to fresh products. For appropriate forms, contact: LACF Registration Coordinator, HFS-618, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 200 C Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20204. Telephone: (202) 205-5282. FAX: (202) 205-4758 or (202) 205-4128.

Improper canning of low-acid meats, e.g., snails, involves a risk of [[botulism]]. When canning snails for home consumption, carefully follow canning instructions for low-acid meats to prevent food poisoning.

State laws also may apply to imports into certain states and to raising snails in a given state. Some states may want to inspect and approve facilities. Thus anyone who plans to raise snails also should check with their State's Agriculture Department.

'''Inguinal lymphadenopathy''' causes [[swollen lymph nodes]] in the groin area. It can be a symptom of infective or neoplastic processes. 
Infective aetiologies include Tuberculosis, [[HIV]], non-specific or reactive lymphadenopathy to recent lower limb infection or groin infections.  Another notable infectious cause is [[Lymphogranuloma venereum]], which is a sexually transmitted infection of the lymphatic system.  Neoplastic aetiologies include [[lymphoma]], leukaemia and metastatic disease from primary tumours in the lower limb, external genitalia or perianal region and melanoma.

==History==
Initiative: Eau was founded on 31 July 2013 by Donald Joseph Brooks and Christina Long in [[Bangor, Maine]], U.S.A.  The two created the initiative following a presentation at their high school describing the [[Water Crisis]] in Burkina Faso.  Initiative: Eau was borne out of a series of charitable  5 kilometer road races which took place in Maine and northern Massachusetts.&lt;ref name = MCB&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/education/undergraduate-initiatives-i-eau/ |title = UNDERGRADUATE INITIATIVES: I: EAU|author = Harvard University Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology|accessdate= July 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As of August 2016, the organization had a staff of 14 across three continents.&lt;ref name = MCB/&gt;

==Programs==
'''H2Odata.city'''&lt;br /&gt;
H2Odata.city is a water infrastructure sustainability project to improve local water infrastructure monitoring and maintenance capacity through the training and responsibilization of maintenance entities.  An instance of the project in Fada N'gourma, Burkina Faso named H2Odata.city.fada was recently funded through a community development grant from the Embassy of the [[United States of America]] to [[Burkina Faso]] in [[Ouagadougou]] and another from the International Foundation.&lt;ref name = telescope/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.dailytelescope.com/initiative-eau-receives-grant-from-the-international-foundation-for-h2odata-city-fada/191059 |title = Initiative: Eau receives grant from the International Foundation for H2Odata.city.fada|author = The Daily Telescope |accessdate= August 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is expected to result in a 66% reduction in the number of water source breakdowns and an 83% reduction in the amount of time a water source remains non-functional after breaking in the city.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Foire de l'Eau'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Foire de l'Eau is a bi-annual event hosted by Initiative: Eau and the BARKA Foundation.

The '''Kuwait Water Towers''' are a prominent group of 31 water towers in [[Kuwait City]], completed in 1976. 

==Design and construction==
In 1965, the government of [[Kuwait]] commissioned the Swedish engineering company of VBB (since 1997 [[Sweco]]) to develop and implement a plan for a modern [[water-supply system]] for Kuwait City. The company built five groups of water towers, 31 in total, designed by its chief architect [[Sune Lindström]], called "the mushroom towers". They were built by VBB out of standard [[reinforced concrete]]. Each tower holds 3,000 cubic meters of water. The tower groups are distinguished by number, height, color and ornamentation and they serve as landmarks for their districts.&lt;ref&gt;''Water Towers'' &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Water Tower Project Brief (pdf) pp 3-6. In: Aga Khan Award&lt;/ref&gt;

For a sixth site, the [[Amir]] of Kuwait, Sheikh [[Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah|Jaber Al-Ahmed]], wanted a more spectacular design. This last group, known as [[Kuwait Towers]], consists of three towers, two of which also serve as water towers.&lt;ref&gt;Kultermann 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Water from the [[desalination]] facility is pumped up to the tower.

These thirty-three towers have together a standard capacity of 102,000 cubic meters of water. "The Water Towers" (The Kuwait Tower and the Kuwait Water Towers) were awarded the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] (1980 Cycle).&lt;ref&gt;Aga Khan Award&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}
{{TOC right}}

A [[children's hospital]] is a hospital that offers its services exclusively to children and adolescents. Most children's hospitals can serve children from birth up to the age of 18, or in some instances, children's hospitals' doctors may treat children until they finish high school. The number of children's hospitals proliferated in the 20th century, as pediatric medical and surgical specialties separated from internal medicine and adult surgical specialties.

Children's hospitals are characterized by greater attention to the psychosocial support of children and their families. Some children and young people have to spend relatively long periods in the hospital, so having access to play and teaching staff can also be an important part of their care. With local partnerships, this can include trips to local botanical gardens, the zoo, and public libraries, for instance.

In addition to psychosocial support, children's hospitals have the added benefit of being staffed by professionals who are trained in treating children. A medical doctor that undertakes vocational training in pediatrics must also be accepted for membership by a professional college before they can practice pediatrics. While many normal hospitals can treat children adequately, pediatric specialists may be a better choice when it comes to treating rare afflictions that may prove fatal or severely detrimental to young children, in some cases before birth. Also, many children's hospitals will continue to see children with rare illnesses into adulthood, allowing for a continuity of care.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4557">The '''low birth-weight paradox''' is an apparently [[paradox]]ical observation relating to the [[birth weight]]s and [[mortality rate]] of children born to [[tobacco smoking]] mothers. [[Low birth-weight]] children born to [[Smoking and pregnancy|smoking mother]]s have a ''lower'' [[infant mortality]] rate than the low birth weight children of non-smokers. It is an example of [[Simpson's paradox]].

==History==
Traditionally, babies weighing less than a certain amount (which varies between countries) have been classified as having ''low birth weight''. In a given population, low birth weight babies have a significantly higher [[infant mortality|mortality]] rate than others; thus, populations with a higher rate of low birth weights typically also have higher rates of child mortality than other populations.

Based on prior research, the children of smoking mothers are more likely to be of low birth weight than children of non-smoking mothers.  Thus, by extension the child mortality rate should be higher among children of smoking mothers.  So it is a surprising real-world observation that low birth weight babies of smoking mothers have a lower child mortality than low birth weight babies of non-smokers.

==Explanation==
At first sight these findings seemed to suggest that, at least for some babies, having a smoking mother might be beneficial to one's health. However the paradox can be explained [[statistics|statistically]] by uncovering a ''[[lurking variable]]'' between smoking and the two key variables: birth weight and risk of mortality. Both variables are acted on independently by smoking and other adverse conditions — birth weight is lowered and the risk of mortality increases. However, each condition does not necessarily affect both variables to the same extent.

The birth weight [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] for children of smoking mothers is shifted to lower weights by their mothers' actions. Therefore, otherwise healthy babies (who would weigh more if it were not for the fact their mother smoked) are born underweight. However, they still have a lower mortality rate than children who have other, more severe, medical reasons why they are born underweight.

'''In short, smoking is harmful in that it contributes to low birth weight which has higher mortality than normal birth weight, but other causes of low birth weight are generally ''more'' harmful than smoking.'''

==Evidence==
If one corrects and adjusts for the confounding by smoking, via stratification or multivariable regression modelling to statistically control for smoking, one finds that the association between birth weight and mortality may be attenuated towards the null. Nevertheless, most epidemiologic studies of birth weight and mortality have controlled for maternal smoking, and the adjusted results, although attenuated after adjusting for smoking, still indicated a significant association.

Additional support for the hypothesis that birth weight and mortality can be acted on independently came from the analysis of birth data from [[Colorado]]: compared with the birth weight distribution in the US as a whole, the distribution curve in Colorado is also shifted to lower weights. The overall child mortality of Colorado children is the same as that for US children however, and if one corrects for the lower weights as above, one finds that babies of a given (corrected) weight are just as likely to die, whether they are from Colorado or not. The likely explanation here is that the higher altitude of Colorado affects birth weight, but not mortality.

== English Premier Football ==
[[Martin Edwards]] asked Watkins to become a director of Manchester United Football Club in May 1984 on the same day as [[Bobby Charlton]]. In 1991, when Martin Edwards floated Manchester United on the stock exchange, Watkins joined the PLC Board as a non-executive director. Edwards and Watkins were the only two directors who served both on the Football Board and the PLC Board. At the [[Annual General Meeting|AGM]] in 2005 [[Malcolm Glazer]] opposed Watkins' re-election to the PLC board along with two other directors [[Philip Yea]] a fellow non-executive director and Andy Anson. After Malcolm Glazer had completed his takeover of Manchester United he de-listed it from the stock exchanged and made it a private company once again. Watkins remains on the club's football board and is the club's lawyer.

Watkins has overseen numerous high-profile [[association football|football]] transfers both at home in the [[United Kingdom]] and abroad.

Watkins regularly speaks on football and sports law issues within the United Kingdom and internationally. He has represented both [[the Football Association]] and the [[Premier League]] at conferences in [[Egypt]], [[France]], [[Qatar]], [[Spain]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Japan]].

In 2012 Watkins was named interim [[Rugby Football League]] Chairman when [[Richard Lewis (tennis and rugby league)|Richard Lewis]]' moved on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past RFL Presidents|url=http://www.therfl.co.uk/the-rfl/history_and_heritage/past_rfl_presidents|work=therfl.co.uk|publisher=[[Rugby Football League]]|accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2012, Watkins stepped down from the board of Manchester United Football Club Ltd after 28 years with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2012/Jun/maurice-watkins-to-leave-manchester-united-board.aspx|title=Director leaves United board|accessdate=29 June 2012|date=29 June 2012|publisher=Manchester United|work=ManUtd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maynilad Water Services, Inc.,''' also known as '''Maynilad,''' is the water and [[wastewater]] services provider of cities and municipalities that form the West Zone of the Greater [[Metro Manila]] Area in the [[Philippines]]. It is an agent and contractor of the [[Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System]] (MWSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mwss.gov.ph/about/our-concessionaires/|title=OUR CONCESSIONAIRES|last=|first=|date=|website=Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System|publisher=|access-date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As part of the [[water privatization in Metro Manila]], the [[Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System]] awarded contracts to two companies splitting Metro Manila into a west and east zones. Maynilad Water Services Inc. was formed in 1997 as a partnership of the Benpres Holdings Corporation (now the [[Lopez Group of Companies]]) and Ondeo Water Services Inc. after it won the bidding to run the water and wastewater services in the West Zone.

Benpres eventually left the partnership in 2006 to settle a US$240 million debt. Then January 24, 2007, a consortium led by [[Metro Pacific Investments Corporation]] and the [[DMCI Holdings, Inc.]] took over the company and able to pay the debt by January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayniladwater.com.ph/about01.php About Maynilad] retrieved May 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water Source==

[[Angat Dam]] is the main source of water for [[Metro Manila]]. It supplies about 90 percent of raw water requirements for Metro Manila through the facilities of the [[Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System]]. Maynilad is sourcing its more than 90 percent raw water supply requirement from Angat Dam.

[[Laguna de Bay]] is the other sources of water of Maynilad, mainly serving Muntinlupa and Cavite.

== Impact ==

=== Access to Water ===
By the end of 2017, Maynilad posted a total of 1,358,758 accounts or about 9.4 million people in its customer base. Almost all customers of Maynilad enjoy 24-hour uninterrupted water supply at an average pressure of seven pounds per square inch.

=== Water Losses ===
When Maynilad was re-privatized in 2007, the company was losing some 1,500 million liters of treated water per day.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mirror.unhabitat.org/bp/bp.list.details.aspx?bp_id=4317|title=More through Less: The Maynilad Non-Revenue Water management program|last=|first=|date=|website=UN HABITAT|publisher=|access-date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This translated to a [[Non-revenue water|Non-Revenue Water]] (NRW) level of 67%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adb.org/results/country-water-action-winning-war-against-leaks-and-losses|title=Country Water Action: Winning the War against Leaks and Losses|last=Asian Development Bank|first=|date=December 31, 2010|website=Asian Development Bank|publisher=|access-date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;—meaning two-thirds of the potable water it was producing was being lost.

Most of the water—some 75%&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; —was lost through the old and inefficient distribution system Maynilad inherited from the government and its previous owners. In fact, the company’s pipe network is considered the oldest in Asia,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; some dating back to the time when the [[Philippines]] was still under the Spanish rule.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.pia.gov.ph/article/view/241458627340/maynilad-repairs-over-27k-pipe-leaks-in-2015|title=Maynilad repairs over 27K pipe leaks in 2015|last=Philippine Public Information Agency|first=|date=March 25, 2016|work=Philippine Public Information Agency|access-date=September 29, 2016|via=news.pia.gov.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a massive pipe replacement program would have dramatically reduced its NRW in a short amount of time, Maynilad decided against it because it would ultimately result in significantly higher tariffs for its customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/green_economy_2011/pdf/session_2_green_jobs_cases_philippines.pdf|title=Maynilad Water District, Philippines|last=Espiritu|first=Roel|date=|website=United Nations - Water International Conference|publisher=|access-date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it invested in its human resources, technical equipment, engineering methodologies and internal procedures so it could serve more people through less water losses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After launching what was dubbed as the “largest NRW management project in the world”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acquacon.com.br/waterloss2010/presentations/day8/11h00irineodimaanodia08sala1.pdf|title=Embarking on theWorld’s Largest NRW Management Project|last=Dimaano|first=Irineo|date=June 6, 2010|website=Aquacon|publisher=|access-date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maynilad has successfully brought down its NRW level to an all-time low of 31% by the end of 2017.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2017, Maynilad plugged a total of 26,792 pipe leaks within its concessionaire area thus bringing the company’s total leak repairs to 316,757 since its re-privatization in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/maynilad-spends-p260m-leak-repairs-2017/379294/|title=Maynilad spends P260M for leak repairs in 2017|last=ManilaTimes.net|first=|date=February 10, 2018|work=Manila Times online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maynilad’s water loss reduction efforts have been recognized by various organizations including the [[International Water Association]]  and the [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme]] (UN Habitat).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Wastewater Management ===
Aside from water services, Maynilad also manages wastewater in the West Zone in the form of sewerage and sanitation services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/Research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=9221768|title=Company Overview of Maynilad Water Services, Inc.|last=Bloomberg|first=|date=|website=Bloomberg|publisher=|access-date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sewerage services involve the treatment of wastewater conveyed via a sewer network&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://interaksyon.com/business/121801/maynilad-las-pias-septage-treatment-plant-starts-operations|title=Maynilad Las Piñas septage treatment plant starts operations|last=Interaksyon.com|first=|date=December 23, 2015|work=Interaksyon.com|access-date=September 29, 2016|via=interaksyon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Maynilad’s sewage treatment plants. At present, only residents and establishments in Ayala Alabang Village in Muntinlupa City, Magallanes Village in [[Makati]], portions of [[Manila]], [[Malabon]], and [[Navotas]], Project 7 and Project 8 in [[Quezon City]], and portions of South [[Caloocan]] may connect to Maynilad’s sewerage system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayniladwater.com.ph/company-services.php?id=23|title=Our Services: Sewerage|last=Maynilad Water Services, Inc.|first=|date=|website=www.mayniladwater.com.ph|publisher=|access-date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Maynilad offers sanitation services or septic tank cleaning to households that are not yet connected to its sewer system. Septic tank cleaning or desludging comes at no extra cost for residential and semi-business account holders, and is conducted every five to seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bworldonline.com/maynilad-offers-desludging-service-january/|title=Maynilad offers desludging service this January|last=BWorld Online|first=|date=January 10, 2018|website=Business World News|publisher=|access-date=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7403">'''Methamphetamine in Bangladesh''' is an illegal substance that is often consumed in the form of [[Ya ba|Yaba]]. Yaba is a drug made by combining methamphetamine and caffeine. They are sold as colorful pills.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/05/asia/methamphetamine-yaba-bangladesh/index.html|title=Yaba addiction: The dark side of Bangladesh's increasing affluence|last=CNN|first=Nathan A.

== History ==

==History==
[[Devi Shetty|Dr. Devi Shetty]] founded Narayana Hrudalaya (NH) in the year  2000 with a heart hospital in Bangalore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/boom-time-for-medicare/article3232025.ece|title=Boom time for medicare|date=2006-04-30|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/slideshows/corporate-industry/devi-shettys-narayana-healthcare-men-behind-success-of-his-low-cost-hospitals/slideshow/20240988.cms|title=Devi Shetty's Narayana Healthcare: Men behind success of his low-cost hospitals|website=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later initiated the concept of micro health insurance scheme along with the Karnataka government called Yeshashwini scheme. During the same period NH started its second hospital in Kolkata – Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences.

From 2009-2012 Narayana Hrudalaya established hospitals in Jamshedpur, Jaipur, Dhawad, Raipur, Ahmedabad, Mysore, and Davangere. In 2013, Narayana Hrudyalaya officially changed its identity to Narayana Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/narayana-hrudayalaya-ltd/infocompanyhistory/companyid-47955.cms|title=Narayana Hrudayalaya History {{!}} Narayana Hrudayalaya Information - The Economic Times|website=economictimes.indiatimes.com|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It now operates several hospitals and heart centres across India, making it the second largest hospital network in India (based on operational bed count).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3022">An '''Obstetric Flying Squad''' is a form of medical retrieval team that is composed of an [[obstetrician]], [[anaesthetist]], [[midwife]] and other healthcare personnel who are on-call to attend to mothers with major obstetric complications occurring in the community.

==History==
The idea of having an Obstetric Flying Squad was suggested by Professor [[E Farquhar Murray]] who wrote that "''instead of rushing a shocked and collapsed patient to hospital for nursing and specialist aid, the specialist and nurse should be rushed to the patient''" (see Liang reference below). In the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1930s, the majority of births occurred in the home.

The first organised obstetric flying squad was started by H. J. Thomson in [[Bellshill]], [[Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]] in 1933 to provide emergency back-up to [[general practitioner]]s and [[midwives]] involved in [[home birth]]s.

The commonest major problems dealt with by the squad were:
* major [[Obstetrical hemorrhage|post-partum haemorrhage]]
* [[retained placenta]]
* [[obstructed labour]]

The mothers were frequently severely shocked and the baby was also likely to be in a precarious position. Many lives were saved during the early years of operation of the service. Other countries with high home-birth rates subsequently copied the idea and set up similar services.

In most [[developed countries]] the majority of births now occur in hospitals and the [[ambulance]] services are well-developed, so the need for the service is extremely low. Less than 1% of births in the UK now occur in the home. The priority now is for rapid transport of distressed mothers to a hospital.

The original aim was to primarily manage obstetric complications on site, then secondarily transport the mother and child to hospital. This gradually evolved into primary on-site resuscitation than rapid transport to definitive care in a hospital. The concept of a hospital medical team going to retrieve patients continues in the concept of trauma retrieval teams.

==Team composition and equipment==
The flying squad typically consisted of an [[obstetrician]], [[anaesthetist]], midwife, and a helper such as a hospital orderly. The service was activated following a phone call for assistance, and the team members would 'fly' (meaning 'travel quickly') to the scene.
 
The anaesthetic equipment initially was quite simple and consisted of a [[Schimmelbusch mask]] to administer [[chloroform]]. Later more sophisticated equipment was used. Of great importance was intravenous infusion equipment, intravenous fluids and later the provision of group O blood.

The '''Office International d'Hygiène Publique''' ('''OIHP''') ({{lang-en|International Office of Public Hygiene}}) was an [[international organization]] founded 9 December 1907 and based in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It was created to oversee international rules regarding the [[quarantining]] of ships and ports to prevent the spread of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and [[cholera]], and to administer other public health conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Iriye|first=Akira|title=Global Community: The Role of International Organizations in the Making of the Contemporary World|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|date=2002|isbn=0520231279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OIHP was dissolved by protocols signed 22 July 1946 and its [[epidemiological]] service was incorporated into the Interim Commission of the [[World Health Organization]] on 1 January 1947.

'''The Organisation for the Prevention of Blindness''' (French: [[:fr:Organisation pour la prévention de la cécité|l’Organisation pour la Prévention de la Cécité, OPC]]) is an [[International nongovernmental organization|international non-governmental organisation (INGO)]] whose actions today focus exclusively on [[French-speaking countries]] in [[West Africa]]. Their mission is to preserve and restore sight amongst some of the most under-privileged communities in the region. The OPC's principal actions concern [[blindness]] prevention, treatment and the elimination of [[Blindness#Diseases|blinding diseases]], such as [[onchocerciasis]], [[trachoma]], [[glaucoma]] and [[cataracts]] as well as formal [[ophthalmological]] training.

== History ==

The OPC was founded on January 13, 1978 by Christian Monnier. Retired from the banking industry, he decided to work with Professor André Dubois-Poulsen, who was the head of department of the XV-XX Hospital and President of the French Ophthalmological Society and Pierre Aubé, an ex-financial advisor.

Professor Dubois-Poulsen presided over the OPC Board of Directors for eight years and organised its first projects in Africa, notably the Yeleen Program in Mali. Thanks to this project, the OPC became a member of the International Agency for Prevention of Blindness (IAPB)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iapb.org/member/organisation-pour-la-pr%C3%A9vention-de-la-c%C3%A9cit%C3%A9-opc&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the OPC has greatly increased its number of missions, creating primary eye care networks, and supporting the African Institute of Tropical Ophthalmology (IOTA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iotaoccge.org/par.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Then, under the presidency of Professor Jean Langlois, the ex-Head of department of the CHU of Rouen, and thanks to Dr. Marcel Chauvet, the medical Inspector General, [[onchocerciasis]], or “river blindness”, control in Africa was elevated to high priority. Onchocerciasis control is still being carried out in conjunction with other NGOs and the [[World Health Organization]]. Links were also established with the Ministry of Cooperation and Development.

During this period of the OPC’s history, a program to create an ophthalmological service in at GRALL Pediatric Hospital in Saigon (Vietnam) was successfully led for five years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anai-asso.org/NET/document/loeuvre_de_la_france/loeuvre_de_la_france/enseignement_sante_action_sociale/hopital_grall/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Professor Langlois became Honorary President, giving the position of President to Professor [[Yves Pouliquen]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.academie-francaise.fr/les-immortels/yves-pouliquen&lt;/ref&gt; ex-Head of the Ophthalmological Department of l’Hôtel-Dieu in Paris, member of the Academy Française from 2001, and member of the French National Academy of Medicine and the International Academy of Ophthalmology.

From 1997, Professor Pouliquen reinforced the importance of onchocerciasis and [[trachoma]]  control in West Africa with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They also developed technical support for the treatment of cataracts. Dr Dominique Négrel, Executive Director of the OPC, expert in ophthalmological public health and in the implementation of eye care structures, contributed greatly to the OPC’s involvement in training health workers in ophthalmology.

Additionally, the OPC implemented a support plan to help combat age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) by providing several centres with powerful diagnostic materials integrated into the resources. This plan was led forward by OPC Vice-President Professor Christian Corbé, medical Inspector General and founding President of the Representative Association of Low-Vision Initiatives,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.academie-air-espace.com/mship/newdetail.php?varMbre=832&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Jean-François Ceccon, ophthalmologist, administrator and ex-Chief Programs Officer of the OPC, and Denis Brillard, OPC administrator and Director of the Welcome centre and Head of the rehabilitation for the blind in Nîmes, ARAMAV.

In 2006, the OPC debuted a prevention program for [[diabetic retinopathy]] in collaboration with the Valentin Haüy Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avh.asso.fr/rubrics/association/association.php?langue=eng&amp; |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403215834/http://www.avh.asso.fr/rubrics/association/association.php?langue=eng&amp; |archivedate=2010-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the AP-HP (Public Hospitals’ Public Assistance) OPHDIAT network.&lt;ref&gt;http://lewebzine.aphp.fr/un-depistage-plus-performant-grace-au-reseau-ophdiat/&lt;/ref&gt; 16 centres were equipped in the Paris region and in Province (the province).

The same year, at the initiative of the OPC, a think-tank composed of 5 Parisian hospitals&lt;ref name="HotelDieu"&gt;including Hôtel Dieu, Lariboisière, Pitié Salpêtrière, XVXX, Institution nationale des Invalides&lt;/ref&gt; participated in a network constitution project (WTF) concerning low vision in Île de France.&lt;ref name="HotelDieu" /&gt;

In 2010, after 12 years as OPC President, Professor Pouliquen gave the reins to Nathalie Brunet, a jurist and head of a French company that is a world leader in its field. The OPC developed its missions in French-speaking countries, mainly Africans ones, but also in Haiti and Moldova as well as in France.

In 2011, Dr Serge Resknioff&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opc.asso.fr/?The-Board-of-Directors&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; became President of the OPC. He is the former head of Prevention of Blindness and Deafness at the WHO and is involved in various organisations associated with blindness prevention.

== Programmes ==

In developing French-speaking African countries, [[cataracts]], [[trachoma]], [[onchocerciasis]] and [[glaucoma]] are the main causes of visual impairment and blindness. It is also estimated that 80% of causes of loss of vision are avoidable and/or curable. This is why the OPC works with its [[Organisation for the Prevention of Blindness#Human Resources|various partners]] in the creation, implementation, the follow-up and evaluation of sustainable programs that address the greatest number possible and allow:

*	The training of qualified and autonomous ophthalmological human resources at all levels: doctor, nurse, senior technician and community agent;
*	The dispensing/distribution of comprehensive eye care of excellent quality;
*	The administering of medical treatments to those in need;
*       The performing of early screening for eye diseases.

=== Training ===

The OPC sets up training programs for ON (Ophthalmic Nurse) and OCO (Ophthalmic Clinical Officer) level ophthalmic mid-level personnel. There are between 8 and 12 students each academic year.

* '''Niger''': fifth class of OCOs is currently studying.
* '''Central African Republic''': Despite a delay due to the difficult conditions which the country has experienced, the implementation and recruitment of the first class of OCOs has been done in February 2013.
* '''Mali''': renovation of Kayes Hospital which will become the new training site for students of the Higher education degree in ocular health (DESSO). The ophthalmologist currently working in this establishment has received a grant from IOTA (Institut d’Ophtalmologie Tropicale de l’Afrique -  African Institute of Tropical Ophthalmology) in order to undertake training to perfect his surgical capacities. The training of primary eye care personnel, which was supposed to begin in Mopti, has been postponed due to recent events in Mali.

'''Peter Bossman''' (born 2 November 1955) is a [[Ghana]]ian-born [[Slovenia]]n [[physician|doctor]] and [[politician]]. He is currently serving as [[mayor]] of [[Piran]], a city and municipality in [[Slovenian Istria]] in south-western Slovenia. A member of the centre-left [[Social Democrats (Slovenia)|Social Democrats]], he defeated the incumbent mayor [[Tomaž Gantar]] in the October 2010 mayoral election to become Slovenia's first black mayor. In 2011 he was also appointed to the [[Committee of the Regions]] of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cormembers.cor.europa.eu/?critId=2028016 Data sheet at the CoR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==

Following a 1966 [[coup]] that saw members of the [[National Liberation Council]] overthrow Nkrumah's elected government, Bossman was forced to leave Ghana.

Unofficial figures following the counting of all ballots showed Bossman with 3418 votes, 185 more votes than the 3233 cast for Gantar.

Bossman was re-elected for a second term as mayor on 19 October 2014. 

===Reaction to election===
Bossman's election as mayor has attracted international attention.&lt;ref name="Slovenia elects Peter Bossman as first black mayor"/&gt; In addition to becoming Slovenia's first black mayor, he has also been described as being probably the first black person to become a mayor in the former Yugoslavia&lt;ref name="Slovenia elects Peter Bossman as first black mayor"/&gt; as well as in the former [[Eastern Bloc]] (although Slovenia as a part of Yugoslavia was only part of the Eastern Bloc briefly until the [[Tito–Stalin Split]], which led to the eventual formation of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]).&lt;ref name="Call me Bossman: Eastern Europe gets its first black mayor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peter Bossman becomes Eastern Europe's first black mayor"/&gt; He has also been widely compared to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]],&lt;ref name="Slovenia elects its 1st black mayor, known as the Obama of his town"/&gt; being dubbed by the media as the 'Obama of Piran'.&lt;ref name="Physician Voted Slovenia's First Black Mayor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peter Bossman becomes Eastern Europe's first black mayor"/&gt; Bossman has, however, insisted he has no political ambitions beyond the mayoralty, having stated that he intends to return to medicine upon leaving office.&lt;ref name="Slovenia black mayor: I'm not Obama"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3602">The {{nihongo|'''Pharmaceutical Affairs Law''' or '''Pharmaceutical Affairs Act'''|薬事法|Yakujihō}} of [[Japan]] is a law regulating the manufacturing, importation, and sale of drugs and medical devices. It was originally passed in 1960.&lt;ref name="Nomura"&gt;{{citation|first=Daisuke|last=Matsuo|url=http://www.nri.co.jp/english/opinion/papers/2009/pdf/np2009149.pdf|title=Effect of Amendment to Japan's Pharmaceutical Affairs Law|journal=Nomura Research Institute Papers|issue=149|date=December 2009|accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative history==
The July 2002 amendment to the law changed the regulatory structure for pharmaceuticals and medical devices, in an effort to align laws more closely with those in the European Union, Australia, Canada, and the United States. The amendment shifted the focus of regulation from the point of manufacturing to the [[point of sale]], and adopted a risk-based classification system for products.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ispe.org/cs/regulatory_review_archive/february_2007_japans_pharmaceutical_affairs_law_pal_opportunities_and_challenges|last=D'Eramo|first=Paul|date=February 2007|title=Japan's Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (PAL): Opportunities and Challenges|periodical=Regulatory Review of the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering|accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The June 2006 amendment to the law (Law No. 69 of 2006, with effective date of June 2009), represented the first change in the sales structure of OTC drugs in 46 years.&lt;ref name="Nomura"/&gt; The amended law permitted stores to sell certain [[over-the-counter drugs]] without having a pharmacist on staff, opening up the market to [[convenience store]]s, [[supermarkets]], and other such stores. [[7-Eleven]] was the first convenience store to take advantage of the amended law, while [[Æon (company)|Aeon]] supermarkets also began selling OTC drugs at a 20% to 40% discount to competing drug stores (including Aeon-affiliated companies). The amendment was expected to put significant competitive pressure on drug stores. However, the law continued to ban internet sales of OTC drugs, which the Ministry of Health had previously justified by stating that drug sales should only be conducted in person by pharmacists or other qualified vendors who could explain the [[side effect]]s of the drugs.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090602a3.html|title=Convenience stores start sales of OTC drugs|periodical=Japan Times|date=2009-06-02|accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, 2013, the Government Cabinet approved a revision of Pharmaceutical Affairs Law to simplify the approval process for medical devices and regenerative medicine products, the safety of regenerative medicine using iPS cells (stem cells).

According to the revised bill, medical equipment can be checked by the private organization including regenerative medicine products and validation of the post-marketing effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asahi.com/politics/update/0524/TKY201305240029.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Science Moms''''' is a 2017 American [[documentary film]] about mothers who advocate for science-based decision-making concerning the health and nutrition of children.{{R|pastemagazine}} The film covers [[vaccines]], [[autism]], celebrity-endorsed health fads, [[cancer]], [[allergies]], [[organic food]], [[GMO|GMOs]], [[homeopathy]], and the [[appeal to nature]] fallacy.{{R|telegraph}}

Originally only available by direct download for a fee from the Science Moms website, in May 2018, the full film was posted to the Science Moms [[YouTube]] channel for free viewing.{{R|Tube}}{{R|Hemant}}

{{quote|text=Please, don't co-opt motherhood and wield your fame to oppose beneficial technologies like [[genetic engineering]]. Certain celebrities have misled thousands of parents into thinking that vaccines are harmful, and we see the same pattern of misinformation repeating itself here. When GMOs are stigmatized, farmers and consumers aren't able to benefit from much-needed advancements like plants with increased nutrients, or plants that can adapt to changing environmental stresses.{{R|IWF}}{{R|forbes}}}}

This letter caught the attention of Natalie Newell, who said "I was so impressed to see this group of intelligent, relatable and reasonable moms standing up for [[science]] and against the fear-based culture that seems to have infected the world of parenting."{{R|pastemagazine}} Newell contacted one of the letter's writers, Jenny Splitter, about possibly making a short documentary about science-based parenting.{{R|pastemagazine}} Following discussion with Splitter and others, Newell went on to produce the film,{{R|pastemagazine}} along with executive producer Stephen Hupp, a professor of [[psychology]] at [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]]. Newell also served as the director on the documentary.{{R|telegraph}}

== Description ==
Featured in the film are writer Jenny Splitter, [[neuroscientist]] Alison Bernstein, [[plant geneticist]] Anastasia Bodnar, [[molecular geneticist]] Layla Katiraee, and [[science communicator]] Kavin Senapathy.{{R|pastemagazine}}{{R|SBM}} As reported by the [[Center for Inquiry]]: "Through interviews with five... moms with careers in science, we get both an idea of what the modern parent has to contend with, as well as some clarity on some of the more hot-button issues around food and health."{{R|centerforinquiry.live}}

According to one of the science moms featured in the film, Kavin Senapathy, the film's goal is to provide a counterpoint to wide-spread anti-science misinformation affecting parenting, including anti-[[GMO]] and anti-[[vaccine]] [[propaganda]].{{R|pastemagazine}} In an interview with [[Susan Gerbic]] for the [[Center for Inquiry]], Senapathy said that for many moms parenthood becomes a large part of their identity. When that happens, "it is easy for purveyors of [[misinformation]] to exploit [them]."{{R|csicop-kavin}} 

According to Katiraee, another science mom in the film, “Celebrities are beautiful, with aspirational lifestyles... but we shouldn’t take their parenting advice without scrutiny. Giving birth doesn’t mean our ‘mommy instinct’ is correct. That requires evidence.”{{R|Herard}}

Producer/director Newell has said, "The goal of the movie is to provide a counter-narrative to the anti-GMO, anti-vax, pro-alternative medicine culture that has popped up in the world of parenting." She also said that critical thinking is very important, and she hopes ''Science Moms'' could act as a springboard to that end.{{R|csicop-newell}}

In her book, ''Whitewash: The Story of a Weed Killer, Cancer, and the Corruption of Science'', Carey Gillam accused the ''Science Moms'' team of having ties to [[Monsanto]], alleging that they "post favorable industry information on an array of websites while appearing to be independent of industry influence."{{R|Whitewash}}{{R|Serious}}{{rp|34:00}} In a December 10, 2017 interview on the ''Serious Inquires Only'' podcast, Natalie Newell speculated as to where Gillam got the idea that the creation of ''Science Moms'' was influenced by Monsanto. Newell thinks that it may be due to an email written by [[biologist]] [[Kevin Folta]] which was obtained through a [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request, in which Folta wrote "Moms are people to talk to about this stuff."{{R|Serious}}{{rp|35:40}}

In January 2018, Parent.com reported on the documentary in an article titled "5 Food Myths It's Time to Stop Believing" and detailed the five food myths that the film takes on as follows:{{R|Parents}}{{R|GLP2018}}
*MYTH: Celebrities are authorities
*MYTH: "Chemical" is a bad word
*MYTH: Organic means pesticide-free
*MYTH: GMO's should terrify you
*MYTH: Fear of food is healthy

[[File:Science Moms with Alison Berstein, Layla Katiraee, Natalie Newell, Kavin Senapathy, and Jenny Splitter CSICon 2017.jpg|thumbnail|left|Panel discussion following the screening of ''Science Moms'' at CSICon 2017]] ''Science Moms'' debuted at [[QED (conference)|QED]] in [[Manchester]] on October 14, 2017.{{R|telegraph}} The American premiere of the film was held at the [[Skeptical movement|scientific skepticism]] conference, [[CSICon]] 2017, run by the [[Center For Inquiry]], on October 28, 2017 in [[Las Vegas]].{{R|telegraph}} 

Upon its initial release, the film was made available for a fee by direct download from the Science Moms website,{{R|telegraph}} but on May 11, 2018, the full film was posted to the Science Moms [[YouTube]] channel for free viewing.{{R|Tube}}{{R|Hemant}}

==Reception==
[[Harriet Hall]] reviewed the documentary and described it as taking a novel approach, saying that it "features scientist moms who are just like other moms except that they understand the science... They provide the facts to counteract unreasonable fears." She concluded that "The 30-minute film is scientifically accurate, persuasive, and well-designed, with good production values." and "A lot of people really need to watch this documentary."{{R|SBM}}

The film was reviewed by Jennifer Muirhead of ''Weekend Notes'', who said that it "invites discussion about how to find quality information amid the sea of opinions and conjecture at our fingertips and encourages fellow parents to seek out the facts and not to let fear control their lives. It's a great resource for all parents and anyone wanting to learn more about GMOs and organic food."{{R|Weekend}}

As reported in the NB Herard, "A group of scientifically literate 'moms' is fighting the flood of misinformation on the Internet with a documentary film. '''Science Moms'',' a 29-minute crowdfunded documentary, enjoyed a well-received world premiere at the QED conference in Manchester, UK in mid October, followed by the U.S. premiere at CSIcon in Las Vegas, NV on October 28, 2017."{{R|Herard}}

In its ''Spotlight on Science'' section, Psyongames.com recommended ''Science Moms'' as a film that would "give a voice to the science-minded moms – the women who are too often drowned out by the fear mongers, the shamers, and the CelebMoms."{{R|psyongames}}

In May 2018, [[Hemant Mehta]] reported on the release of the film to YouTube, and said "It's such a relief to know these mothers are out there, raising their kids with reason instead of giving in to the irrational nonsense people constantly throw in their direction."{{R|Hemant}}

'''The Society for Mathematical Biology (SMB)''' is an international association co-founded in 1972 in USA by Drs.[[George Karreman]], [[Herbert Daniel Landahl]] and (initially chaired) by [[Anthony Bartholomay]] for the furtherance of joint scientific activities between [[Mathematics]] and [[Biology]] research communities,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smb.org/governance/smb_history.shtml|title=SMB &amp;ndash; "Childhood, Boyhood, Youth."|last=Conrad|first=Michael|date=September 1996|publisher=Society for Mathematical Biology Newsletter|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smb.org/governance/history.shtml History of SMB&lt;/ref&gt; The society publishes the [https://www.springer.com/math/biology/journal/11538 "''Bulletin of Mathematical Biology''"] ({{ISSN|1522-9602}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/math/biology/journal/11538|title=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology|publisher=Springer New York|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/maini/PKM%20publications/170.pdf "Bulletin of Mathematical Biology—Facts, Figures and

==History of The Society for Mathematical Biology==
The Society for Mathematical Biology emerged and grew from the earlier school of [[mathematical biology|mathematical biophysics]], initiated and supported by the Founder of [[Mathematical biology|Mathematical Biology]], [[Nicolas Rashevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Robert. 1972. "''Tribute to Nicolas Rashevsky''" 1899-1972. ''Progress in Theoretical Biology'' '''2'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smb.org/governance/smb_history.shtml|title=SMB &amp;ndash; CHILDHOOD, BOYHOOD, YOUTH|last=Conrad|first=Michael|date=September 1996|publisher=Society for Mathematical Biology Newsletter|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the roots of SMB go back to the publication in 1939 of the first international journal of mathematical biology, previously entitled "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/x513p402w52w1128/ The Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics]"—which was founded by Nicolas Rashevsky, and which is currently published by SMB under the name of "''Bulletin of Mathematical Biology''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/x513p402w52w1128/ The Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics]&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Rashevsky also founded in 1969 the non-profit organization "''Mathematical Biology, Incorporated''"—the precursor of SMB. Another notable member of the [[University of Chicago]] school of mathematical biology was [[Anatol Rapoport]] whose major interests were in developing basic concepts in the related area of [[mathematical sociology]], who cofounded the [[Society for General Systems Research]] and became a president of the latter society in 1965. Herbert D. Landahl was initially also a member of Rashevsky's school of mathematical biology, and became  the second president of SMB in the 1980s; both Herbert Landahl and [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] from Rashevsky's research group were focused on dynamical systems approaches to [[systems biology|complex systems biology]], with the latter researcher becoming in 1980 the president of the [[Society for General Systems Research]]. 
&lt;!---{{Society for General Systems Research Presidents}}---&gt;

==Research and educational activities==
In addition to its research and news publications, the society supports education in: [[mathematical biology]], mathematical biophysics, [[systems biology|complex systems biology]] and [[theoretical biology]] through sponsorship of several topic-focused graduate and postdoctoral courses. To encourage and stimulate young researchers in this relatively new and rapidly developing field of mathematical biology, the society awards several prizes, as well as lists regularly new open international opportunities for researchers and students in this field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smb.org/prizes/index.shtml SMB Mathematical Biology Prize Awards&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sociology of leisure''' or '''leisure sociology''' is the study of how humans organize their [[leisure|free time]]. Leisure includes a broad array of activities, such as [[sport]], [[tourism]], and the playing of [[game]]s. The sociology of leisure is closely tied to the [[sociology of work]], as each explores a different side of the work-leisure relationship. More recent studies in the field move away from the work-leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and [[culture]].

Studies of leisure have determined that observable patterns cannot be easily explained by socioeconomic variables such as income, occupation or education. The type of leisure activity is substantially influenced by the individual's situation (presence or lack of family, age, and other factors).

==Theory==
Sociology of leisure is a fairly recent [[subfields of sociology|subfield of sociology]], compared to more traditional subfields such as [[sociology of work]], [[sociology of the family]], and [[sociology of education]]: it saw most of its development in the second half of the 20th century.{{Ref label|a|a|none}}&lt;ref name=parker&gt;Stanley Parker, "The Sociology of Leisure: Progress and Problems," ''The British Journal of Sociology'', vol. 26, no. 1, March 1975, pp. 91-101.

[http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.so.06.080180.000321 Online], [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2946003 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; [[Joffre Dumazedier]] distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope.&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to [[self-fulfillment]]. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive.&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

There are some unresolved questions concerning the definition of work: in particular, whether unpaid endeavors, such as volunteering or studying, are work.&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; Non-work time should not be equated with free time, as it comprises not only free time, dedicated to leisure, but also time dedicated to certain obligatory activities, such as [[Homemaking|housework]].&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Dividing activities into free and dedicated time is not easy. For example, brushing one's teeth is neither work nor leisure; scholars differ in their classifications of activities such as eating a meal, shopping, repairing a car, attending a religious ceremony, or showering (various individuals may or may not classify such activities as leisure).&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; The relation between work and leisure can also be unclear: research indicates that some individuals find skills that they have acquired at work useful to their hobbies (and vice versa), and some individuals have used leisure activities to advance their work careers.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Sociologists also disagree as to whether political or spiritual activities should be included in studies of leisure.&lt;ref name=parker2&gt;S.R. Parker, "Sociology of Leisure," ''Sociology'', 10 (1), 1976, Oxford (0038-0385), p. 166. [http://soc.sagepub.com+166.pdf Online]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, among some [[occupational community|occupational communities]], such as police officers or miners, it is common for work colleagues to be off-time friends and to share similar, work-based leisure activities.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

Apart from a definition of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, a week, or a year.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, the study of the sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]], as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history.&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national [[tatistical survey|surveys]] such as the [[General Household Survey]] in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971).&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on [[qualitative research|qualitative methods]] of research ([[interviews]]).&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt;

==Research==
Over time, emphasis in studies of leisure has shifted from the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between leisure and [[culture]].&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; [[Marshall Gordon]] noted that there are two approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; The formal approach focuses on [[empirical]] questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], the relation between leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the [[sociology of sport]]).&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; The historical-theoretical approach studies the relation between leisure and [[social change]], often from [[structural functionalist|structural-functionalist]] and [[neo-Marxist]] perspectives.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; [[Sheila Scraton]] provided a different analysis, comparing [[North America]]n and [[Great Britain|British]] studies.&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; The British approaches focus on input from [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]], [[critical Marxism]], and [[feminism]]; the American approaches concentrate on the [[social psychology|social-psychological]] tradition.&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt;

==Findings==
Many sociologists have assumed that a given type of leisure activity is most easily explained by [[socioeconomic]] variables such as [[income]], [[Employment|occupation]] or [[education]].&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; This has yielded fewer results than expected; income is associated with total money spent on such activities, but otherwise only determines what type of activities are affordable.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Occupation has a similar effect, because most occupations heavily influence a person's income (for example, membership in a prestigious occupation and "[[country club|country-club]]" activities such as golf or sailing are significantly [[correlation|correlated]]—but so is membership in those occupations and high income, and those activities with high cost).&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Education is correlated with having a wide range of leisure activities, and with higher dedication to them.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; As Kelly noted, "Predicting a person's leisure behavior on the basis of his socioeconomic position is all but impossible."&lt;ref&gt;J. Kelly, "Socialization toward Leisure: a Developmental Approach," ''Journal of Leisure Research'', vol. 6, 1974, pp. 181-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, type of leisure activity is substantially influenced by the individual's immediate situation—whether he has a family, whether there are recreational facilities nearby, and age.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Early family influences, particularly involving the more social leisure activities, can be profound.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; The type of leisure activity also depends on the individual's current place in the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

Specific findings in sociological studies of leisure are illustrated by [[John Robinson (sociologist)|John Robinson]]'s late-1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that Americans, on average, have four hours of leisure time each weekday, and more on weekends—six hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;John Robinson, ''How Americans Use Their Time: A Social-Psychological Analysis of Everyday Behavior'', New York, Praeger, 1977, pp. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Amount of leisure time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; However, the amount of free time does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if their job is their central interest.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; During the second half of the twentieth century, watching [[television]] became a major leisure activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours of leisure per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television.&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;J. Robinson and P. Converse, "Social Change Reflected in the Use of Time," in A. Campbell and P. Converse, eds., ''The Human Meaning of Social Change'', New York, Russell Sage, 1972, pp. 17-86.&lt;/ref&gt; Shared leisure activities increase marital satisfaction.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

'''Stereolithography''' ('''SLA''' or '''SL'''; also known as '''stereolithography apparatus''', '''optical fabrication''', '''photo-solidification''', or '''resin printing''') is a form of [[3D printing]] technology used for creating [[Scale model|model]]s, [[prototype]]s, [[pattern]]s, and production parts in a layer by layer fashion using [[photopolymerization]], a process by which light causes chains of molecules to link, forming [[polymers]].&lt;ref name=Patent&gt;[[U.S. Patent]] [https://patents.google.com/patent/US4575330A/en 4,575,330] (“Apparatus for Production of Three-Dimensional Objects by Stereolithography”)&lt;/ref&gt; Those polymers then make up the body of a three-dimensional solid. Research in the area had been conducted during the 1970s, but the term was coined by [[Chuck Hull]] in 1984 when he applied for a patent on the process, which was granted in 1986. Stereolithography can be used to create things such as prototypes for products in development, medical models, and computer hardware, as well as in many other applications. While stereolithography is fast and can produce almost any design, it can be expensive.

==History==
Stereolithography or "SLA" printing is an early and widely used 3D printing technology. In the early 1980s, Japanese researcher Hideo Kodama first invented the modern layered approach to stereolithography by using ultraviolet light to cure photosensitive polymers.&lt;ref name=Gibson /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate Guide"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://formlabs.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-stereolithography-sla-3d-printing/#sla-systems|title=The Ultimate Guide to Stereolithography (SLA) 3D Printing|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=&lt;!--No Date Stated--&gt; |website=[[Formlabs]] |publisher=Formlabs, Inc. |access-date=26 December 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, just before Chuck Hull filed his own patent, [[Alain Le Mehaute]], [[Olivier de Witte]] and [[Jean Claude André]] filed a patent for the stereolithography process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first = Andre|last = Jean-Claude|title = Disdpositif pour realiser un modele de piece industrielle|newspaper = National De La Propriete Industrielle|url = http://bases-brevets.inpi.fr/fr/document/FR2567668/publications.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French inventors' patent application was abandoned by the [[French General Electric Company]] (now Alcatel-Alsthom) and [[CILAS]] (The Laser Consortium). Le Mehaute believes that the abandonment reflects a problem with innovation in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first = Alexandre|last = Moussion|title = Interview d’Alain Le Méhauté, l’un des pères de l’impression 3D|newspaper = Primante 3D|date = 2014|url = http://www.primante3d.com/inventeur}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Mehaute Reflections"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://3dprint.com/65466/reflections-alain-le-mehaute/|title = Alain Le Méhauté, The Man Who Submitted Patent For SLA 3D Printing Before Chuck Hull|date = May 15, 2015|access-date = |website=3dprint.com |publisher =3DR Holdings, LLC |last = Mendoza|first = Hannah Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term “stereolithography” was coined in 1984 by [[Chuck Hull]] when he filed his patent for the process.&lt;ref name=Patent/&gt;&lt;ref name=photopolymer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photopolymer.com/stereolithography.htm |title=Stereolithography / 3D Printing / Additive Fabrication |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Photopolymers |publisher=Savla Associates |access-date=10 August 2017 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214125415/http://www.photopolymer.com/stereolithography.htm |archivedate=14 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chuck Hull patented stereolithography as a method of creating 3D objects by successively "printing" thin layers of an object using a medium curable by [[ultraviolet light]], starting from the bottom layer to the top layer. Hull's patent described a concentrated beam of ultraviolet light focused onto the surface of a vat filled with a liquid photopolymer. The beam is focused onto the surface of the liquid photopolymer, creating each layer of the desired 3D object by means of [[Cross-link|crosslinking]] (generation of intermolecular bonds in polymers). It was invented with the intent of allowing engineers to create prototypes of their designs in a more time effective manner.&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;Gibson, Ian, and Jorge Bártolo, Paulo. “History of Stereolithography.” Stereolithography: Materials, Processes, and Applications.

Stereolithography's success in the automotive industry allowed 3D printing to achieve industry status and the technology continues to find innovative uses in many fields of study.&lt;ref name="Hull, Chuck 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Paul F. “Introduction to Rapid Prototyping and Manufacturing.” Rapid Prototyping and Manufacturing: Fundamentals of Stereolithography. 1st Ed. (1992): 4-6. Print. 7 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts have been made to construct mathematical models of stereolithography processes and to design algorithms to determine whether a proposed object may be constructed using 3D printing.&lt;ref&gt;B. Asberg, G. Blanco, [[Jit Bose|P. Bose]], J. Garcia-Lopez, [[Mark Overmars|M. Overmars]], [[Godfried Toussaint|G. Toussaint]], G. Wilfong and B. Zhu, "Feasibility of design in stereolithography," ''Algorithmica'', Special Issue on Computational Geometry in Manufacturing, Vol. 19, No. 1/2, Sept/Oct, 1997, pp. 61–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process that works by focusing an ultraviolet (UV) laser on to a vat of [[photopolymer]] resin.&lt;ref&gt;Crivello, James V., and Elsa Reichmanis. "Photopolymer Materials and Processes for Advanced Technologies." Chemistry of Materials Chem. Mater. 26.1 (2014): 533. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of computer aided manufacturing or [[computer-aided design]] (CAM/CAD) software&lt;ref name="Lipson, Hod 2004"&gt;Lipson, Hod, Francis C. Moon, Jimmy Hai, and Carlo Paventi. "3-D Printing the History of Mechanisms." Journal of Mechanical Design J. Mech. Des. (2004): 1029-033. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;, the UV laser is used to draw a pre-programmed design or shape on to the surface of the photopolymer vat. Photopolymers are sensitive to ultraviolet light, so the resin is photochemically solidified and forms a single layer of the desired 3D object.&lt;ref&gt;Fouassier, J. P. "Photopolymerization Reactions." The Wiley Database of Polymer Properties 3 (2003): 25. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the build platform lowers one layer and a blade recoats the top of the tank with resin.&lt;ref name="Ultimate Guide" /&gt; This process is repeated for each layer of the design until the 3D object is complete. Completed parts must be washed with a [[solvent]] to clean wet resin off their surfaces.&lt;ref name="Form 2 Review"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Dong|last=Ngo|title = Formlabs Form 2 3D Printer review: An excellent 3D printer for a hefty price|url = http://www.cnet.com/products/formlabs-form-2-3d-printer/#!|website = [[CNET]]|accessdate = 3 August 2016|quote=More specifically, as the print platform lowers itself into the resin glass tank, an ultraviolet laser light, from underneath the see-through tank, shines on it. (For this reason, SLA is sometimes called the laser 3D-printing technology.) Exposed to the laser light, the resin cures, solidifies and sticks to the platform. As more resin is exposed to the laser light, the pattern is created and joins the layer above. As more and more layers are being created, the build platform slowly -- very slowly -- moves upward, finally pulling the entire object out of the tank as the print process is finished.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to print objects "bottom up" by using a vat with a transparent bottom and focusing the UV or deep-blue polymerization laser upward through the bottom of the vat.&lt;ref name="Form 2 Review" /&gt; An inverted stereolithography machine starts a print by lowering the build platform to touch the bottom of the resin-filled vat, then moving upward the height of one layer. The UV laser then writes the bottom-most layer of the desired part through the transparent vat bottom. Then the vat is "rocked", flexing and peeling the bottom of the vat away from the hardened photopolymer; the hardened material detaches from the bottom of the vat and stays attached to the rising build platform, and new liquid photopolymer flows in from the edges of the partially built part. The UV laser then writes the second-from-bottom layer and repeats the process. An advantage of this bottom-up mode is that the build volume can be much bigger than the vat itself, and only enough photopolymer is needed to keep the bottom of the build vat continuously full of photopolymer. This approach is typical of desktop SLA printers, while the right-side-up approach is more common in industrial systems.&lt;ref name="Ultimate Guide" /&gt;

Stereolithography requires the use of supporting structures which attach to the elevator platform to prevent [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] due to gravity, resist lateral pressure from the resin-filled blade, or retain newly created sections during the "vat rocking" of bottom up printing. Supports are typically created automatically during the preparation of CAD models and can also be made manually. In either situation, the supports must be removed manually after printing.&lt;ref name="Ultimate Guide" /&gt;

In these images different tissues show up as different levels of grey. Selecting a range of grey values enables specific tissues to be isolated. A region of interest is then selected and all the pixels connected to the target point within that grey value range are selected. This enables a specific organ to be selected. This process is referred to as segmentation. The segmented data may then be translated into a format suitable for stereolithography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bibb|first=Richard|title=Medical Modelling: the application of advanced design and development technologies in medicine|year=2006|publisher=Woodhead Publishing Ltd|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-84569-138-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While stereolithography is normally accurate, the accuracy of a medical model depends on many factors, especially the operator performing the segmentation correctly. There are potential errors possible when making medical models using stereolithography but these can be avoided with practice and well trained operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winder|first=RJ|author2=Bibb, R |title=Medical Rapid Prototyping Technologies: State of the Art and Current Limitations for Application in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|journal=Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|year=2005|volume=63|issue=7|pages=1006–15|doi=10.1016/j.joms.2005.03.016|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/14449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereolithographic models are used as an aid to diagnosis, preoperative planning and implant design and manufacture. This might involve planning and rehearsing [[Osteotomy|osteotomies]], for example. Surgeons use models to help plan surgeries&lt;ref name=CMU&gt;{{Cite web|title = Applications of SLA|date= |url = https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rapidproto/students.98/master/project2/applications.html|website= Stereolithography|publisher= |accessdate = 7 October 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but prosthetists and technologists also use models as an aid to the design and manufacture of custom-fitting implants.

===Prototyping===

Stereolithography is often used for prototyping parts. For a relatively low price, Stereolithography can produce accurate prototypes, even of irregular shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Elizabeth|last=Palermo|title = What is Stereolithography?|date= 16 July 2013|url = http://www.livescience.com/38190-stereolithography.html|website = [[Live Science]]|publisher= [[Purch Group]]|accessdate =7 October 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses can use those prototypes to assess the design of their product or as publicity for the final product.&lt;ref name=CMU/&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===
One of the advantages of stereolithography is its speed; functional parts can be manufactured within a day.&lt;ref name="Hull, Chuck 2012"/&gt; The length of time it takes to produce a single part depends upon the complexity of the design and the size. Printing time can last anywhere from hours to more than a day.&lt;ref name="Hull, Chuck 2012"/&gt; Prototypes and designs made with stereolithography are strong enough to be [[machining|machined]]&lt;ref name=Proto3000&gt;{{cite web |url=https://proto3000.com/stereolithography-rapid-prototyping-solutions-sla-applications.php |title=Sterolithography |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Proto3000 |publisher=Proto3000 Inc. |access-date=22 June 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://luma3dprint.com/3d-print-technologies/ |title=3D Print technologies |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Luma 3D Print |publisher=LUMA-iD Ltd. |access-date=22 June 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also be used to make master patterns for [[injection molding]] or various [[metal casting]] processes.&lt;ref name=Proto3000 /&gt;
===Disadvantages===
Although stereolithography can be used to produce virtually any synthetic design,&lt;ref name="Lipson, Hod 2004"/&gt; it is often costly; common photopolymers can cost about {{US$|800|link=yes}} per gallon and SLA machines can cost {{US$|250000}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/stereolith.htm |title=How Stereolithography 3-D Layering Works |last1=Brain |first1=Marshall |website=[[Howstuffworks]] |publisher=Infospace LLC |access-date=17 December 2015|date=2000-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/formlabs-fuse1-sls-printer-news/ |title=With lasers and hot nylon, Formlabs just took 3D printing to a whole new level |last=Prindle |first=Drew |date=6 June 2017 |website=[[Digital Trends]] |publisher=Designtechnica Corporation |access-date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, public interest in 3D printing has inspired the design of several consumer SLA machines which can cost {{US$|3500}} or less, such as the [[Formlabs#Form 2|Form 2]] by [[Formlabs]]&lt;ref name="Form 2 Review"/&gt; or the Nobel 1.0 by XYZPrinting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Dong|last=Ngo|title = XYZprinting Nobel 1.0 3D Printer review: Highly detailed prints at a high cost |url = http://www.cnet.com/products/xyzprinting-nobel-1-0-3d-printer/|website = [[CNET]]|accessdate = 3 August 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4685">'''Tobacco-specific nitrosamines''' ('''TSNAs''') comprise one of the most important groups of [[carcinogen]]s in [[tobacco]] products, particularly cigarettes and fermented dipping snuff.

==Background==
These [[nitrosamine]] carcinogens are formed from [[nicotine]] and related compounds by a [[nitrosation]] reaction that occurs during the curing and processing of tobacco.&lt;ref name=cancergov&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cancer.gov/researchandfunding/MERIT/Hecht | title = Metabolism of Carcinogenic Tobacco-Specific Nitrosamines | author = Stephen S. Hecht | publisher = [[National Cancer Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially the plant's natural [[alkaloids]] combine with [[nitrate]] forming the nitrosamines.&lt;ref&gt;Jianxun Zhang et al, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104403050700623X Selective Determination of Pyridine Alkaloids in Tobacco by PFTBA Ions/Analyte Molecule Reaction Ionization Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry], ''Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry'', Volume 18, Issue 10, October 2007, Pages 1774-1782&lt;/ref&gt;

They are called tobacco-specific nitrosamines because they are found only in tobacco products, and possibly in some other nicotine-containing products.  The tobacco-specific nitrosamines are present in [[cigarette]] smoke and to a lesser degree in "smokeless" tobacco products such as [[dipping tobacco]] and [[chewing tobacco]]; additional information has shown that trace amounts of NNN and NNK have been detected in e-cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goniewicz ML, Knysak J, Gawron M, Kosmider L, Sobczak A, Kurek J, Prokopowicz A, Jablonska-Czapla M, Rosik-Dulewska C, Havel C, Jacob P, Benowitz N |title=Levels of selected carcinogens and toxicants in vapour from electronic cigarettes |journal=Tobacco Control |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=133–9 |year=2014 |pmid=23467656 |pmc=4154473 |doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2012-050859 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are present in trace amounts in [[snus]].  They are among the most important carcinogens in cigarette smoke, along with combustion products and other carcinogens.&lt;ref name=cancergov/&gt;

Among the tobacco-specific nitrosamines, [[nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone]] (NNK) and [[N-Nitrosonornicotine|''N''-nitrosonornicotine]] (NNN) are the most carcinogenic.&lt;ref name=cancergov/&gt; Others include [[N'-Nitrosoanatabine|''N&amp;prime;''-nitrosoanatabine]] (NAT) and [[N-Nitrosoanabasine|''N''-nitrosoanabasine]] (NAB).  NNK and its metabolite [[4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol]] (NNAL) are potent systemic lung carcinogens in rats. Tumors of the nasal cavity, liver, and pancreas are also observed in NNK- or NNAL-treated rats. NNN is an effective esophageal carcinogen in the rat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=First identification of a strong oral carcinogen in smokeless tobacco |publisher=American Chemical Society |date=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2012/august/first-identification-of-a-strong-oral-carcinogen-in-smokeless-tobacco.html |accessdate=November 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and induces [[respiratory tract tumor]]s in mice, hamsters, and mink. A mixture of NNK and NNN caused [[oral tumor]]s when swabbed in the rat oral cavity. Thus, considerable evidence supports the role of tobacco-specific nitrosamines as important causative factors for cancers of the [[lung cancer|lung]], [[pancreatic cancer|pancreas]], [[esophageal cancer|esophagus]], and [[oral cancer|oral cavity]] in people who use tobacco products.&lt;ref name=cancergov/&gt;

Metabolism and chemical binding to DNA ([[DNA adduct|adduct]] formation) are critical in [[cancer induction]] by NNK and NNN. 

Human metabolism of NNK and NNN varies widely from individual to individual, and current research is attempting to identify those individuals who are particularly sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of these compounds. Such individuals would be at higher risk for cancer when they use tobacco products or are exposed to secondhand smoke. Identification of high-risk individuals could lead to improved methods of prevention of tobacco-related cancer, and improved risk valuation for insurers.

[[Water supply]] is the process of providing water in a systematic way through installed pumps and pipe lines. Before water is provided to a specific area, it undegoes a process called [[sanitation]] to ensure that the quality of water received is safe for human consumption. The Philippines’ water supply system dates back to 1946 after the country achieved its independence. Government agencies, local institutions, non-government organizations, and other corporations are primarily in charge in the operation and administration of water supply and sanitation in the country.

== Water Resources ==
[[File:Ambuklao Dam captured by Mitchell Yumul.jpeg|thumb|358x358px|The Ambuklao Dam and Hydeoelectric Power Plant in Bokod, Benguet, Philippines.]]
The Philippines’ main sources of water are [[List of rivers of the Philippines|rivers]], [[List of lakes of the Philippines|lakes]], [[river basins]], and groundwater [[reservoir]]s. The longest and largest river, [[Cagayan River (Mindanao)|Cagayan River]], discharges approximately 53, 943 million cubic meters of water annually. Its groundwater reserves are 47, 895 million cubic meters replenished by rainfall and seepage from rivers and lakes. The lakes are utilized mainly for fish cultivation. The four major groundwater reservoirs are in Cagayan, Central Luzon, Agusan, and Cotabato. There are 438 major dams and 423 smaller dams. [[List of dams and reservoirs|Dams]] and reservoirs are mainly used for: water storage, water supply, irrigation, regulation of flood, and hydropower.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = WATER RESOURCES|url = http://www.denr.gov.ph/index.php/component/content/article/19.html|website = www.denr.gov.ph|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manila metropolitan area water is mostly supplied by the [[Angat Dam]], [[Ipo Dam]], and [[La Mesa Dam and Reservoir|La Mesa Dam]] (also known as Angat-Ipo-La Mesa water system).  Some of the well known and larger dams in rural areas are: [[Ambuklao Dam]], developed for flood control, [[irrigation]], and [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] source of Baguio and some places in Luzon; and [[Magat Dam]], a major source of irrigation water and hydroelectric power in Isabela.

== Water Use  ==

28.52 billion m³ of water was withdrawn from various sources in the Philippines in 2000: 74% (21.10 billion m³) was used for agricultural purposes, 9% (2.57 billion m³) for industrial processes, and 17% (4.85 billion m³) for domestic consumption.&lt;ref name="ADB 5"&gt;{{cite journal
  |last = Asian Development Bank|first = |authorlink = Asian Development Bank|author2 = Asia-Pacific Water Forum|title = Country Paper Philippines. Asian Water Development Outlook 2007|journal = |volume = |issue = |pages = |publisher = |year = 2007|url = http://www.adb.org/publications/asian-water-development-outlook-2007|doi = |issn = |isbn = |id = |accessdate = 2008-04-14}}, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agricultural ===
Agricultural water management in the Philippines primarily focuses on the subject of irrigation. The country has 3.126 million hectares of irrigable land, 50% (1.567 million hectares) of which already has irrigation facilities. 50% of irrigated areas are developed and operated by the government through the National Irrigation System (NIS). 36% is developed by the government and operated by irrigators’ associations through the Communal Irrigation System, while the remaining 14% is developed and operated by individual or small groups of farmers through a Private Irrigation System (PIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Agricultural Water Management Systems in the Philippines: Current Status and Policy Direction|url = http://www.fftc.agnet.org/library.php?func=view&amp;style=type&amp;id=20140304162637|website = www.fftc.agnet.org|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial ===
The use of water for industrial purposes include the "utilization of water in factories, industrial plants and mines, and the use of water as an ingredient of a finished product."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Greenpeace Southeast Asia. ''The state of water resources in the Philippines.'' Quezon City: Greenpeace, 2007. http://www.greenpeace.org/seasia/ph/Global/seasia/report/2007/10/the-state-of-water-in-the-phil.pdf (accessed 03 October 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Industries that are found to be water-intensive are involved in the manufacturing of food and dairy, pulp and chemical products, and textile materials. These industries are usually found in the National Capital Region, CALABARZON, and Region III. In a study by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in 1999, the intensive use of water in industry is critical in terms of the production of hazardous wastes. Thousands of tons solvent wastes, heavy metals, lubricants, and intractable wastes are improperly disposed of annually in Metro Manila.&lt;ref&gt;Luken, Ralph A. ''Industrial Policy and the Environment in the Philippines.'' Vienna: United Nations Industrial Development Organization, 1999. http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/import/userfiles/timminsk/rio10-ind-philippines-eng.pdf (accessed 29 October 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic ===
According to a study by David and Inocencio, the medium of water provision is dependent on the income class of a certain household. Higher income brackets usually rely on private waterworks as a source of water, while lower income brackets usually consume less by depending on vended water (sold by those who have access to private waterworks). Lower income households pay much higher water prices than higher income households because of their lack of access to water service providers.&lt;ref&gt;David, Cristina C. and Arlene B. Inocencio. "Understanding Household Demand and Supply of Water." Paper presented at the Pulong-Saliksikan sa PIDS on Water Policies, 24 September 1996. http://dirp4.pids.gov.ph/ris/pdf/pidspn9604.pdf (accessed 03 October 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service provision ==
In 2000, the average water production was 175 liters per day per capita (l/d/c).&lt;ref name="inh 2000"&gt;The Philippines had 75,766,140 inhabitants in 2000; source: http://devdata.worldbank.org/query/&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Water Resources Board (NWRB), the average consumption of water was 118 l/d/c in 2004. The highest consumption was recorded in the East Zone of Metro Manila with 232 l/d/c.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Levels of water systems ===
According to a 2005 World Bank study, approximately 5,000 service providers exist in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="WB 110"&gt;{{cite journal

=== Service providers ===
According to the Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation of [[UNICEF]] and [[WHO]], access to an [[improved water source]] increased from 85% in 1990 to 92% in 2010.&lt;ref name="WB 1162"&gt;{{cite journal
  |last = World Bank|first = |authorlink = World Bank|title = Philippines: Meeting Infrastructure Challenges|journal = |volume = |issue = |pages = |publisher = |date = December 2005|url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEAPINFRASTRUCT/Resources/PHInfra.pdf|doi = |issn = |isbn = |id = |accessdate = 2008-04-09}}, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Local Government Units ====
Most households in the Philippines are provided water by their Local Government Units (LGUs), either directly through a city or municipal engineering department or through community-based organizations (CBOs). CBOs involved in water supply include 200 cooperatives, 3,100 Barangay Water and Sanitation Associations (BWSAs) and 500 Rural Water Supply Associations (RWSAs).&lt;ref name="WB 1102" /&gt; CBOs usually operate Level I or Level II water supply systems with support from the national government or [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs). In many cases, the CBOs later convert Level I and II facilities into Level III supply systems.Typically, all LGU-operated arrangements do not recover their full costs and rely heavily on local government subsidies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal
  |last = World Bank|first = |authorlink = World Bank|title = Philippines: Meeting Infrastructure Challenges|journal = |volume = |issue = |pages = |publisher = |date = December 2005|url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEAPINFRASTRUCT/Resources/PHInfra.pdf|doi = |issn = |isbn = |id = |accessdate = 2008-04-09}}, p. 112&amp;#x2013;113&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Water Districts ====
[[File:Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA).svg|220px|thumb|right|Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) Seal]]
A water district is a utility that is legally and financially separate from the municipality. In urban areas outside of Metro Manila, water districts served around 15.3 million people from 861 municipalities in 2011. To form a water district, the local government needs confirmation from the Local Waterworks and Utilities Administration (LWUA), a specialized lending institution for provincial waterworks, from which it will receive technical assistance and financial support. The local government appoints the board members of the water districts. This system typically has better performance and higher cost recovery than water systems that are run directly by municipalities. The Philippine Association of Water Districts (PAWD),  fosters the exchange of experiences between water districts and provides training to its members.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|title = What is PAWD?|url = http://www.pawd.org.ph/company_profile.php|accessdate = 4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, USAID and the ADB agreed to support PAWD in establishing a national Water Operators Partnerships (WOPs) program that promotes twinning partnerships among Water Districts.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|title = Philippines Water Association Adopts National Water Operator Partnerships Program|url = http://www.waterlinks.org/news/philippines-water-association-adopts-national-water-operator-partnerships-program|publisher = WaterLinks|accessdate = 4 January 2013|date = 12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Large-scale Private Operators ====
[[File:Metro_Manila_water_zones.PNG|thumb|The zones of [[Metro Manila]] allocated to [[Maynilad Water Services|Maynilad Water]] (red) and [[Manila Water]] (blue).]]In Metro Manila, water service has been carried out by two private concessionaires since 1997: The Manila Water Company in the East Zone, and Maynilad Water Services, Inc. in the West Zone. Although national government has supported private service providers since the 1990s, there are few arrangements outside of Metro Manila. Joint ventures exist in [[Tagbilaran City]] and in [[Subic Bay]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal
  |last = World Bank|first = |authorlink = World Bank|title = Philippines: Meeting Infrastructure Challenges|journal = |volume = |issue = |pages = |publisher = |date = December 2005|url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEAPINFRASTRUCT/Resources/PHInfra.pdf|doi = |issn = |isbn = |id = |accessdate = 2008-04-09}}, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; These private water service providers provide Level III services together with water districts.

==== Small-scale independent providers ====
A significant share of the population in urban areas receive services from small-scale independent providers.

==Access==
=== Water supply ===
In 2015, 92% of the total population had access to "at least basic water", or 94% in urban areas and 90% in rural areas. In 2015, there were still 8 million people without access to "at least basic water".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JMP2015" /&gt; The term "at least basic water" is a new term since 2016, and is related to the previously used "[[improved water source]]".

In earlier years, according to the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation|Joint Monitoring Program (JMP)]] report on March 2012, 43% of the Philippines had access to Level III private water service providers in 2010. Access to an improved water source increased from 84% in 1990 to 92% in 2012. However, there is a wide inconsistency between the access to water of urban areas (61%) and rural areas (25%). Although overall spending remained low, the national government has begun increasing investments in sectors outside Metro Manila.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Asian Development Bank. ''Philippines: Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Road Map.'' Mandaluyong City: Asian Development Bank, 2013. http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/33810/files/philippines-water-supply-sector-assessment.pdf (03 October 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sewage and Sanitation ===

In 2015, 74% of the total population had access to [[Improved sanitation|"improved" sanitation]], or 78% in urban areas and 71% in rural areas. In 2015, there were still 27 million without access to "improved" [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://washwatch.org/en/countries/philippines/summary/|title=WASHwatch.org - Philippines|website=washwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JMP2015"&gt;WHO/UNICEF (2015) [https://www.wssinfo.org/documents/ Progress on sanitation and drinking water - 2015 update and MDG assessment], Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the situation was as follows: Only 5% of the total population was connected to a sewer network.The vast majority used flush toilets connected to septic tanks. Since sludge treatment and disposal facilities were rare, most effluents were discharged without treatment.&lt;ref name="WB 1072"&gt;{{cite journal

In Metro Manila alone, about 75 local companies provide tank-desludging services.&lt;ref name="WB 1162" /&gt;

The first Philippine [[constructed wetland]], serving about 700 households, was completed in 2006 in a peri-urban area of [[Bayawan City]] which has been used to resettle families that lived along the coast in informal settlements and had no access to safe water supply and sanitation facilities.&lt;ref name="susana2"&gt;Lipkow, U., von Münch, E.

== Economic Aspects ==

=== Water Bill Information ===

==== Current Charges Before Tax ====
* '''Basic charge:''' This covers the cost of operating, maintaining, improving and expanding the distribution network, as well as the facilities responsible for bringing potable water to the end user. The Basic Charge is based on the latest approved tariff schedule.
* '''Foreign Currency Different Adjustment (FCDA):''' This is a percentage of the Basic Charge which accounts for fluctuations of the Philippine Peso against other countries' currencies subject to periodic review and adjustment. The FCDA for the second quarter of 2015 is 0.18% of the Basic Charge.
* '''Environmental Charge:''' This is for the mitigation of environmental impacts in the course of water and wastewater operation. It is 20% of the Basic Charge applicable to all customers.
* '''Sewer Charge:''' 0% of the Basic Charge is added for Residential and Semi-Business customers with a sewer line connection. 30% of Basic Charge, on the other hand, is charged for Commercial and Industrial customers. 
* '''Maintenance Service Charge:''' This covers the maintenance of the water meter. The charge changes depending on the size of the water meter. The minimum charge is 1.50 Philippine pesos for a 13mm-sized meter.

==== Value Added Tax ====
The value added tax (VAT) is charged by the government and accounts to 12% of the sum of the items included in current charges before tax.

==== Other charges ====
These are special miscellaneous charges such as connection fees, unscheduled desludging of septic tank service fees, etc.

==== Previous Unpaid Amount ====
This pertains to charges billed prior to the billing period. This should be settled immediately together with the current charges to avoid disconnection of water service.

=== Tariffs ===
The fragmented sector led to different [[tariff]] structures and levels according to the respective management model. The connection fees, which are charged in most of the cases, often impede new connections for poverty-stricken areas.&lt;ref name="Data Book 162"&gt;{{cite journal
  |last = National Water Resources Board (NWRB) |author2=Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) |author3=Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) World Bank|title = Philippines Towns Water Utilities 2004 Data Book}}
, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

LGU-operated systems In LGUs, tariff levels and structures vary widely. Since most connections are not metered, it is difficult to charge tariffs depending on consumption. Where LGUs provide Level I or II services, they usually charge no or very low tariffs, although connection fees are common. The costs of providing the service are usually met by local governments.&lt;ref name="WB 1222"&gt;{{cite journal
  |last = World Bank|first = |authorlink = World Bank|title = Philippines: Meeting Infrastructure Challenges|journal = |volume = |issue = |pages = |publisher = |date = December 2005|url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEAPINFRASTRUCT/Resources/PHInfra.pdf|doi = |issn = |isbn = |id = |accessdate = 2008-04-09}}, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  The NWRB in its benchmarking project had about half of the average tariff of private operators and water districts.The cost of tariff in LGU-operated systems is, on average, lower than other management models.&lt;ref name="Data Book 162" /&gt; In order to introduce cost recovery tariffs and effective regulation, the NWRB issued a primer on tariff setting and regulation in March 2005. The document provides the basic guidelines of tariff setting. The manual helps to determine future revenue requirements and to set annual base tariffs based on estimated consumption levels.The process of tariff approval as well as the guidelines to prepare the required annual report are described in detail. Furthermore, the document gives advice on tariff structures and water rate adjustments.

'''Water Districts.'''   In water districts, tariffs increased notably since 1996. The tariff structure is similar to the model used in Metro Manila, with an average tariff for the first 10m³ and increasing tariffs for additional consumption.&lt;ref name="deflator2"&gt;GDP-Deflator source: World Development Indicators database: http://devdata.worldbank.org/query/&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2006, the national average tariff for 30 m³ was US$0.36 per m³, which is more than double of 1996.&lt;ref name="WB 1222" /&gt; The NWRB found an average tariff of US$0.41 within a sample of 18 water districts in 2004, which is the highest average tariff of all management models. The average connection fee was US$55, somewhat lower than among private operators.&lt;ref name="Data Book 162" /&gt;

'''Metro Manila''' In the capital region, an initial tariff is to be paid for the first 10 m³ consumed, with increasing blocks for additional consumption. Furthermore, consumers connected to sewerage pay an additional charge of 50% and all users must pay a 10% environmental surcharge.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal
  |last = Manila Water Company|first = |authorlink = |title = Official website: FAQs|journal = |volume = |issue = |pages = |publisher = |url = http://www.manilawater.com/customer-service/frequently-asked-questions#nsca-3|doi = |issn = |isbn = |id = |accessdate = 2008-04-11|format = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071108204250/http://www.manilawater.com/customer-service/frequently-asked-questions#nsca-3 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate = 2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; For new consumers, a connection fee is charged, which was US$134 in April 2007 in the East Zone&lt;ref name="MWSSRO2"&gt;{{cite journal
  |last = MWSS Regulatory Office|first = |authorlink = |title = Tariff matrix|journal = |volume = |issue = |pages = |publisher = |url = http://www.mwssro.org.ph/downloads/tariffmatrix2_corrected.pdf|doi = |issn = |isbn = |id = |accessdate = 2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the MWSS Regulatory Office, just before privatization, the average tariff per m³ in Metro Manila was US$0.26. After the concession contracts came into force in 1997, tariffs dropped to US$0.05 (East Zone) and US$0.12 (West Zone). In 2006, the average tariff rose to US$0.31 in the East Zone and US$0.43 in the West Zone (all figures converted into real 2006 prices).  While the tariff was highest among private operators, the connection fee was higher within water districts.

'''Others.'''Users who rely on other sources such as private small-scale operators mostly pay more for water. In the capital region, it is a common practice to buy water from MWSS and resell. In this case, small-scale operators pay a higher tariff than the residential one and pass the higher cost on to the end-user.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite journal
  |last = World Bank|first = |authorlink = World Bank|title = Philippines: Meeting Infrastructure Challenges|journal = |volume = |issue = |pages = |publisher = |date = December 2005|url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEAPINFRASTRUCT/Resources/PHInfra.pdf|doi = |issn = |isbn = |id = |accessdate = 2008-04-09}}, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost-recovery ===
The operation ratio (O) of a certain water service provider reflects its cost-recovery situation. It is computed by the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;O=C/R&lt;/math&gt;

where O is the operation cost, C is the total annual cost, and R is the annual revenue. An operation ratio under 1 means that revenues cover the costs of operation and maintenance. In a study last 2004, only 5 out of 45 had an operation ratio of more than 1, reflecting a poor operation ratio among majority of the participating utilities.  All the loss-making providers were operated directly by LGUs, and were mostly characterized by a high share of non-revenue water, poor service continuity, low tariffs, and low coverage within their respective service area. The five best-performing service providers consisted of four water districts and one private operator.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite journal

, p. 6; 9&amp;#x2013;11; 36&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investment ===
According to the World Bank, investment in water supply and sanitation from 1983 to 2003 has been far below the required levels to maintain assets, to expand access and to improve service quality. Total investment has fluctuated at around ₱3-4 billion a year, while the cost of implementing the Clean Water Act of 2004 has been estimated at up to P35 billion a year.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite journal

== Political Aspects ==

=== History ===
From the Philippines' [[History of the Philippines (1946-1965)#Philippine independence|independence in 1946]] until 1955 most water supply systems were operated by local authorities. From 1955 to 1971, control of urban water supply was passed to the national government.&lt;ref name="MM 52"&gt;{{cite journal

However, comprehensive water resources management was only introduced in 2004.

==== Pre-Marcos Administration ====
The Manila Waterworks Authority, founded in 1878, became part of the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) when it was founded in 1955.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

==== Marcos Administration (1965-1986) ====
* '''1971.''' NAWASA was transformed into the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) in 1971 under the government of Ferdinand Marcos. MWSS was made responsible for service provision in Metro Manila, whereas other municipal and provincial water and sewerage systems in about 1,500 cities and towns were transferred back to local governments.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite journal

* '''1973.''' A new management model for urban water supply was introduced in 1973: LGUs were encouraged to form utilities called Water Districts which would operate with a certain degree of autonomy from LGUs. They would receive technical assistance and financial support from the newly created Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA).&lt;ref name="MM 52" /&gt;
* '''1976.''' In 1976, the National Water Resources Board (NWRB) was created through the National Water Code of the Philippines to coordinate policies concerning water resources.&lt;ref name="WB 1092"&gt;{{cite journal
  |last = World Bank|first = |authorlink = World Bank|title = Philippines: Meeting Infrastructure Challenges|journal = |volume = |issue = |pages = |publisher = |date = December 2005|url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEAPINFRASTRUCT/Resources/PHInfra.pdf|doi = |issn = |isbn = |id = |accessdate = 2008-04-09}}, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''1980.''' The Rural Waterworks Development Corporation (RWDC) was founded in 1980. It is responsible for water supply in areas where neither MWSS nor LWUA carries out the service or assists the LGUs, respectively. The RWDC was expected to create [[rural]] water supply associations in order to construct, operate, and maintain their own water supply systems in communities with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="MM 52" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite journal

The Integrated Water Supply Program (1980&amp;ndash;2000) was initiated by the national government. Its main objective was to increase water coverage to 70% of the Filipino population by 1987 and 90% by 1992. Consequently, the development of the sector was supported with great effort: Between 1978 and 1990, more than [[United States dollar|US$]]120 million was invested in 11 rural water supply projects. Nevertheless, toward the end of the decade only 4,400 functioning rural water systems, about 5% of the 96,200 potential systems, existed in the country. Many of the recently constructed systems failed shortly after completion, partly due to poor construction and service.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{cite journal

The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) was expected to construct and rehabilitate Level I water wells, rainwater collectors, and springs. Every [[barangay]] should receive at least one additional potable water source. In addition, the Department of Local Government and Community Development (DLGCD) was given the task of training local water user associations in the operation and maintenance of water facilities.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite journal

In 1997, the [[Maynilad Water Services|Maynilad Water Services, Inc.]] was awarded the [[Concession (contract)|concession]] contract for the West Zone, while the [[Manila Water|Manila Water Company, Inc.]] was awarded the East Zone of Metro Manila. The concession contracts, which are expected to last for 25 years, included targets concerning coverage, service quality, and economic efficiency. The objective was to increase water coverage in Metro Manila to 96% by 2006. The companies were expected to be regulated by the newly created MWSS Regulatory Office, financed by the concessionaires. After the concession came into force, public opposition soon emerged due to repeated tariff increases. However, it is worth mentioning that tariffs decreased after privatization in 1997, and did not reach the pre-privatization level until 2001 or 2002. Private concessionaires suffered from a severe drought and the [[Asian financial crisis]] of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Xun; Malaluan, Nepomuceno A. (2008).

==== Estrada Administration (1998-2001) ====
According to the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) of 1998 up to 2004, the [[Joseph Estrada|Estrada]] administration's main objectives concerning water were to (i) create an independent regulatory agency, (ii) develop a pricing mechanism that considers cost recovery, (iii) strengthen the implementation of [[Drainage basin|watershed]] rules, and (iv) encourage private participation in water resources administration.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{cite journal

==== Arroyo Administration (2001-2010) ====
Because of the rapid currency devaluation, MWSS' dollar-denominated debt service doubled. Consequently, tariffs continued to rise and targets concerning coverage and NRW were adjusted downward with the agreement of the regulatory agency. Maynilad went bankrupt in 2003 and was turned over to MWSS in 2005. On the other hand, Manila Water had begun to make profits by 1999 and performed well financially and in reducing NRW.&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{cite journal

=== Policy ===
General policies concerning the water and sanitation sector are formulated by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) in its MTPDP. Since the 1990s, private sector participation and decentralization are the main objectives of water policies.&lt;ref name="WB 1092" /&gt; The MTPDP of 2004 up to 2010 aimed at extending the coverage of potable water to 92%&amp;ndash;96% by 2010 through public and private investments, with priority given to 400 barangays with poor water supply coverage.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{cite journal

The responsibilities are defined by the 1976 National Water Code and the 2004 Clean Water Act, which consolidated laws on water supply and sanitation and water resources management.

==== 1976 National Water Code (PD 1067)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = P.D. No. 1067|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1976/pd_1067_1976.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====

Regarded as Presidential Decree No. 1067, dated December 31, 1976, the 1976 National Water Code was an effort of then President Ferdinand E. Marcos that aimed to strengthen water legislations in the face of the increasing scarcity of water and its changing water patterns. The Water Code was an intended solution to revise and consolidate regulations made on the ownership, appropriation, utilization, exploitation, development, conservation and protection of water resources in the country. Founded on the principle that "All waters belong to the State," the National Water Resources Council was then created and tasked to control and regulate the use and development of water resources in behalf of the government.

Regulations were made through the acquisition of water permits, given to persons not limited to government-owned and controlled corporations, for water appropriation and usage. Specifications were included on the maximum amount of water diverted or withdrawn, the maximum rate of diversion or withdrawal and the times during the year when water may be diverted or withdrawn. Instances may also arise where water permits are revoked on cases of non-use, violation of the conditions imposed by the Council, unauthorized sale of water, pollution and public acts detrimental to public health and safety.

In declared flood control areas, rules and regulations are administered to prohibit and control activities that may damage and cause deterioration of the lakes and dikes, changes in the natural flow of the river and increases in flood losses or intensified floods. Watersheds, or areas of land adjacent to any surface water or overlying any groundwater, are to be declared as protected areas of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. These efforts ensure the quality of water defined by a standard set by the National Pollution Council Commission according to the different uses of water. Except those functions under the Code that may fall under specific government agencies, the Council is given the power to make all necessary decisions and determinations provided for in the said Code. The Council may provide accompanying penalties consisting of fines not exceeding One Thousand Pesos (P1,000.00) and/or the suspensions or revocation of water permits or any rights given to use water as well as enforce its decisions with the assistance of local and national police agencies.

==== Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004 (RA 9275)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 9275|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2004/ra_9275_2004.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Republic Act 9275 provides for a comprehensive water quality management policy amidst economic growth. The policy provides for the consistent protection, preservation and revival of the quality of Philippine waters with frameworks patterned through the pursuit of sustainable development. Importantly provided for by this act are Water Quality Management Systems and Institutional Mechanisms.

Water Quality Management Systems involve area designations by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), national sewage and septage management programs and allocation of special funds to support and maintain water quality. Areas that have similar hydrogeological conditions, which affect the physiochemical, biological and bacteriological reactions and diffusions of pollutants in the water bodies, are declared as Water Quality Management Areas. The management area is governed by a DENR representative as chair and board members composed of representatives from local government units (LGUs), relevant national government agencies, registered non-governmental organizations, water utility sectors and the business sector. On the other hand, water bodies with specific pollutants that have exceeded the guidelines for water quality are identified as Non-attainment Areas. LGUs are tasked to prepare and implement contingency plans, such as relocations, for the protection of the health and welfare of the residents, while the government improves the affected quality of water within the potentially affected areas.

Funds administered by the DENR, and other concerned agencies, are on special accounts in the National Treasury to be utilized in financing containment and clean-up operations in water pollution cases; restorations of ecosystems and rehabilitation of affected areas; research, enforcement and monitoring activities; technical assistance to implementing agencies; grants as rewards and incentives; and other disbursements made solely for the prevention, control of water pollution and administration of the management areas in the amounts authorized by the Department.

Wastewater charges are also established to provide strong economic inducement for polluters to modify their production or management processes or to invest in pollution control technology in order to reduce the amount of water pollutants generated in their discharge of wastewater into water bodies. Owners, or operators of facilities, that discharge regulated waste are then required to secure discharge permits.

Institutional Mechanisms emphasized the collaborative efforts made in the hopes of having cleaner and better quality water through the Lead Agency (DENR); the Roles of Local Government Units in sharing the responsibility of maintaining and improving water quality within their territorial jurisdictions; the Business and Industry Role in formulating incentives for the adoption of innovative equipment and processes that preserve and protect water bodies; and Linkage Mechanisms through partnerships with government agencies and departments such as the Philippine Coast Guard, DPWH, Department of Agriculture (DA), DOH, Department of Science and Technology (DOST), Department of Education (DepEd), Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and Department of the Interior and the Local Government (DILG).

=== Government Agencies and Institutions ===

==== Local Waterworks and Utilities Administration (LWUA) ====
The LWUA is a specialized lending institution that promotes and oversees the development of provincial waterworks. It is also entrusted with setting water quality and service standards for water districts. Furthermore, it provides technical assistance and is sometimes involved in the districts through board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lwua.gov.ph/|title=Safe water for the Filipino|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P.D. 198 (May 25, 1973), the Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973 created LWUA and the water districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lwua.gov.ph/pd_198/indx_pd198.htm|title=pd198|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree authorized the formation, on local option basis, of autonomous water districts to develop the local water supply systems and the establishment of a national-level agency to cater to the needs of these water districts. According to the LWUA website, to date, it has established 584 water districts covering about 691 cities and towns outside Metro Manila. It has completed a total of 1,431 water supply projects while extending P 17 billion in loans to the districts of which P11 million has been availed to the benefit of some 12 million Filipinos with improved water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lwua.gov.ph/about_lwua/30_history.htm lwua.gov.ph, LWUA: Thirty years of service to a once-thirsty nation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== National Water and Resources Board (NWRB) ====
The [[National Water Resources Board (Philippines)|National Water and Resources Board (NWRB)]] is the forefont government agency which handles the Philippines water sectors’ policies, regulations and quasi-judicial functions.  It acts accordingly with the principles of the [[Integrated water resources management|Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM)]] as it ensures the efficiency, conservation, utilization, development and protection of the state’s water supply. Its functions and responsibilities.

==== Rural Waterworks Development Corporation (RWDC) ====
Executive Order No. 577 which was passed last January 12, 1980, aims to provide full coverage of water supply services in the country. In line with this, RWDC was established to bring and administer water supply in areas with less than 20,000 as population. RWDC works together with LWUA in determining areas under their jurisdiction.

==== Department of Interior and Local Government ====
Concerning local government-managed systems, the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) defines and enforces quality and performance standards. However, in both cases, local governments retain the responsibilities for planning, financing, and regulating water supply.&lt;ref name="WB 1102" /&gt;

==== Philippine Center for Water and Sanitation ====
The Philippine Center for Water and Sanitation (PCWS) provides technical assistance to local governments, communities, and non-profits on low-cost water supply and sanitation options. It also engages in [[action research]] with households. It leads the Philippines water sanitation and health (WASH) coalition of non-profit organizations and local governments. It was created in 1990 under the name of International Training Network (ITN) and adopted its current name in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itnphil.org.ph/index.html Philippine Center for Water and Sanitation:about us], retrieved on August 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financing and External Cooperation ==
Outside the privatized services in Metro Manila, one source of finance for water supply is government grants channeled through the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) and the Municipal Development Funds Office (MDFO). But these are far from sufficient to meet investment needs, which is why loan financing is necessary. Some LGUs obtain loans from public banks such as the [[Development Bank of the Philippines|Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)]] and the [[Land Bank of the Philippines|Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP)]], and also from corporations in other countries, such as the World Bank, and JICA from Japan.(see below).&lt;ref name="World Bank2"&gt;{{cite journal

External development agencies that work on water supply and sanitation in the Philippines include the ADB, GTZ, JICA, USAID and the World Bank

=== Asian Development Bank (ADB) ===
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has assisted the government in increasing sanitized water supply to different sectors in the Philippines. Through the MWSS New Water Source Development Project, approved in 2003 and ended in October 2008, ADB has contributed a total of US$3.26 million, whereas MWSS provided US$1.71 million. The joint-project sought to develop up to 3 water source projects for Metro Manila and to improve the financial management as well as the accounting and fiscal control systems of MWSS. In 2008 as well, studies for two water source projects were completed emphasizing environmental and social impacts amidst water quality improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''&lt;br&gt;'''In 2013, the ADB made preparations for loans for financing: the Water District Development Sector Project, the Urban Water and Sanitation Sector Project, the Angat Water Transmission Improvement Project, and future technical assistance and other lending activities to be discussed with specific Government agencies involved.

ADB was also able to release a report on: the assessments of current conditions and constraints to developing water supply and sanitation in the country, strategies to be implemented to counter and solve these constraints, and road maps and plans on a [[sustainable sanitation]] reality for all. The Philippine Sustainable Sanitation Roadmap and Plan (PSSR), included in the report, served as a guide for water sanitation efforts as it presented the vision, goals, outcomes, outputs, activities and inputs needed to achieve an improved water quality nationwide. Approved by the subcommittee on Water Resources in 2010, the Department of Health (DOH) has agreed to spearhead the agenda by preparing a national sustainable sanitation plan based on the PSSR. The DILG has also aligned its water and sanitation strategy with the requirements of the PSSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Philippines: Water supply and sanitation sector assessment, strategy, and road map|last = |first = |publisher = Asian Development Bank|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Mandaluyong City, Philippiness|pages = |url = http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/33810/files/philippines-water-supply-sector-assessment.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ) ===
The German Corporation for International Cooperation ([[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit|GTZ]], now GIZ) supported the sector through the rural water supply and sanitation program, designed to improve the living conditions of the poor in selected rural areas of the country. The program sought to overcome the institutional confusion and to strengthen governmental organizations at the national, provincial, and municipal levels. The main program partner was the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG). In addition, the decentralization plan of the National Water Resources Board was supported. The program, which ran from 2006 to 2009, helped to introduce low-cost options for sanitation, such as [[urine-diverting dry toilet]]s and the first Philippine [[constructed wetland]], treating wastewater from about 700 households in [[Bayawan]].&lt;ref name="susana2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2007, the World Bank approved an investment loan of US$5 million. The objectives of the project were to assist the Philippine government in reforming institutions in order to attract private investment in the wastewater sector, to improve the coordination of institutions responsible for preventing water pollution, and to promote innovative wastewater treatment techniques. The project, which ran from 2007 to 2012, provided technical assistance as well as support for institutional coordination and private sector involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The project followed the Manila Second Sewerage Project, which was carried out from 1996 to 2005. After the privatization of MWSS, it was restructured in order to adapt it to the new institutional framework. The objectives were to (i) reduce the pollution of waterways in Metro Manila and its surrounding bays; (ii) reduce the health risks caused by human exposure to sewage in Metro Manila; and (iii) establish a gradual low-cost improvement of sewerage services in Metro Manila. From 1997 to 2005, the number of people with sewer connections increased from 721,000 to 1,101,000 and the population with regularly desludged septic tanks rose from only 1,600 to 288,000. The total cost of the project was US$48.06 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==== Urban Water and Sanitation Project APL2 ====
This project aimed to reach approximately 40 LGU-operated water systems, which were given technical assistance and financial support. The four components of the project were to: (i)  finance civil works, equipment, and supervision for improved water supply systems in LGUs, including private sector participation where feasible; (ii) finance improved sanitation infrastructure; (iii) provide investment and assistance in micro-drainage infrastructure; and (iv) provide funds for the hiring of a construction supervision consultant and specialized consultants. The World Bank decided to contribute through a US$30 million loan to the project, while the remaining US$5.2 million are financed by local institutions. The project began in 2001 and ended in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |last = World Bank|first = |authorlink = World Bank|title = Projects &amp;ndash; Philippines: LGU Urban Water and Sanitation Project APL2|work = |publisher = |date = 2007-06-12|url = http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?Projectid=P069491&amp;Type=Overview&amp;theSitePK=40941&amp;pagePK=64283627&amp;menuPK=64282134&amp;piPK=64290415|format = |doi = |accessdate = 2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank supports private sector participation through Design-Build-Lease contracts and Long-Term Operation and Maintenance contracts between LGUs and private operators. Therefore, the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) channel financing from the World Bank to LGUs, which engage private operators. Under the Design-Build-Lease contracts, valid for 15 years and renewable for an additional 15 years, a local private operator prepares, builds, and operates a new water supply system. A World Bank loan channeled through the DBP finances 90% of the construction cost, and the remainder is contributed through the LGU. The water tariff must cover expenses for operation and maintenance, as well as a lease fee and a return for the private operator.

Long-Term Operation and Maintenance contracts are used in LGUs which recruit a private company to construct a new water supply system and later engage water associations or user cooperatives to operate the system under the contracts, which are awarded for 15 years with the possibility of renewal for another 15 years. Similar to the Design-Build-Operate contracts, 90% of the construction cost of the water system is financed with a World Bank loan channeled through the LBP. The water user groups are required to work under commercial rules. They have full administrative, accounting and financial autonomy.&lt;ref name="World Bank2" /&gt;

==== Metro Manila Wastewater Management Project (MWMP) ====
Last 2012, the World Bank was able to approve a budget of $275 Million for a project aimed at improving wastewater collection and treatment practices in several catchment areas of Metro Manila and help improve Manila Bay’s water quality. Entitled the Metro Manila Wastewater Management Program (MWMP), the project supports investments from the Manila Water Company, Inc (MWCI) and Maynilad Water Services, Inc in increasing collection and wastewater treatment primarily from households and establishments in the area. The project is divided into 2 components as MWCI takes charge of the east zone and Maynilad the west zone, of the metropolitan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Projects  : Metro Manila Wastewater Management Project {{!}} The World Bank|url = http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P113844/manila-wastewater-management-project?lang=en|website = www.worldbank.org|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a budget of $193.4 Million, investments by Maynilad include: (a) a sewage treatment plant, and the necessary sewage lines, covering North and South Pasig; and (b) the carrying out of other wastewater management investment sub-projects agreed upon by the government, Land Bank of the Philippines, World Bank and MWCI. Maynilad, with a budget of $178.3 Million, has its investments: (a)  in sewage treatment plants and associated wastewater conveyance systems in Quezon City, Pasay, Alabang, Muntinlupa, Valenzuela; and (b) a septage treatment plant in the southern part of Metro Manila.&lt;ref name=":36"&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Bank Approves US$275M Financing for Better Sanitation Services in Metro Manila|url = http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2012/05/15/world-bank-approves-275M-for-metro-manila-wastewater-management-project|website = www.worldbank.org|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With about 2 million cubic meters of wastewater generated daily, and only 17% of this getting treated before disposal to water bodies around the metro, water pollution has destroyed most of Manila Bay and the nearby Laguna de Bay.  Manila Water and Maynilad have both conceptualized a 25-year program that ensures 100% wastewater collection and treatment for Metro Manila. With the MWMP, their efforts would be supported and would aid in not just improving the current state of the surrounding environment but also contribute to a boost in recreational and tourism opportunities.&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt;

==== Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) ====
The [[Japan International Cooperation Agency|Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)]], along with the international community striving to achieve the targets of United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals (MDG), has been campaigning to make a significant reduction in the number of people who still lack access to safe drinking water. Reliable water resources management, improvement of access to water supply in urban areas, reduction of non-revenue water (NRW), improvement of water/energy use, sustainable rural water supply, and promotion of improved sanitation in developing countries are the main issues that JICA prioritizes. In 2008, through the Development Bank of the Philippines, about $200 million was loaned to the Philippines to fund local governments and domestic private-sector companies for the development of water supply and sewerage facilities. Despite the establishment of funding, financing will only be granted to water utilities if the business management improves, hence JICA actively assists the water supply utilities’ capacity development through practical cooperation with financial aid. JICA not only works to improve access to safe drinking water in urban areas of developing countries, but also aids water facilities with business planning and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.wcdrr.org/wcdrr-data/uploads/878/JICA%E2%80%99s%20Assistance%20Strategy%20on%20Water%20Supply%20and%20Sanitation.pdf|title = JICA’s Assistance Strategy on Water Supply and Sanitation|last = |first = |date = May 2012|journal = Japan International Cooperation Agency|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==

=== Drinking water quality ===
Water quality usually does not meet the standards set by the national government, especially in urban areas.  As a result, [[waterborne diseases]] remain to be a severe public health concern in the country. About 4,200 people die each year due to contaminated drinking water.&lt;ref name="WB 1072" /&gt;

=== Non-revenue water ===
Non-revenue water (NRW) is defined as the difference between the amount of water put into the distribution system and the amount of water billed to consumers. It is usually used as an indicator for water utility performance. High levels of non-revenue water usually indicate low quality water utility. It has three components: ''physical losses'', which consist of leakage from the system caused by poor operations and maintenance, the lack of active leakage control, and poor quality of underground assets; ''commercial losses'' caused by under-registration of water meters, errors in data handling, and theft, and ''unbilled authorized consumption'' which includes water used by a specific utility for operational purposes (e.g. firefighting and specific consumer groups).

[[Non-revenue water]] decreased in the East Zone of Metro Manila since privatization. In 1996, Manila had an NRW of 61%, while capital cities from other Asian countries ranged from having 35&amp;ndash;38%. In 2002, NRW dropped to 53% in the East Zone. On the other hand, non-revenue water in the West Zone increased as the primary waterwork utility encountered severe financial problems.&lt;ref name="CRC 52"&gt;{{cite journal

According to the National Water Resources Board (NWRB), the average share of NRW among participating service providers was 27.5% in 2004. The particularly high NRW of Manila's West Zone was confirmed to have a record with 68%. Generally, the smaller utilities performed better concerning NRW than the larger ones. However, many NRW data are based on estimates, given the fact that only 15 of the 45 service providers had 100% production and consumption metering coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Labor Productivity ===
The number of staff was reduced at the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) after privatization. On average, 10 employees were responsible for 1,000 connections in 1996. Fast forward to 2002, only about 4 employees were left, reflecting a decreases of around 58%.&lt;ref name="CRC 52" /&gt; According to LWUA, only about 7 employees per 1,000 connections worked in water districts in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) |first= |authorlink= |title=Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan 2004&amp;ndash;2010 |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |location=Philippines |year=2004 |url=http://www.gov.ph/documents/MTPDP%202004-2010%20NEDA%20v11-12.pdf |doi= |issn=0119-3880 |isbn= |id= |accessdate=2008-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106031926/http://www.gov.ph/documents/MTPDP%202004-2010%20NEDA%20v11-12.pdf |archivedate=January 6, 2007 }}

The NWRB Philippines Towns Water Utilities 2004 Data Book found, on average, 7 employees per 1,000 connections in 2004. Private utilities, on average, performed best and systems which were directly managed by LGUs performed worst. Not surprisingly, providers with more than 10,000 connections need significantly fewer employees per connection than those with fewer than 10,000 connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

With rapid increase in population, urbanization, and industrialization, the quality of Philippine waters is reduced especially in densely populated areas and regions of industrial and agricultural activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = State of water : Philippines|url = http://www.wepa-db.net/policies/state/philippines/overview.htm|website = www.wepa-db.net|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to data from the DENR and PEM, domestic wastewater discharges, agricultural wastewater, and industrial wastewater are the three main sources of water pollution. These are also known as "point sources" that emanate toxic substances into "non-point sources" or certain bodies of water. Domestic wastewater consists of sewage containing organic waste, solids, and coliforms produced by domestic activities such as laundry, bathing, cooking, and other kitchen activities. Agricultural wastewater, the major source of pollution in rural areas, contain pollutants resulting from agricultural and livestock activities like the maintenance of piggeries which usually do not have proper wastewater treatment facilities. Different industries also contribute largely to the water pollution. Industrial activities such as manufacturing of food, textile, paper, and slaughterhouses emit large amounts of organic waste.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

El Niño and Global Warming

[[El Niño#Global warming|El Niño]], a weather phenomenon occurring about every two to seven years when warm water in the western tropical Pacific Ocean shifts Eastward, causing ocean temperatures to be warm, last developed in the country in late 2014. For the past several decades, it has been observed that its occurrence has increased due to climate change as a result of global warming. Its negative impacts may either be heavy rainfall or drought. El Niño greatly impacts the power supply, water supply, and agricultural sectors of the country. The reduced rainfall leading to drought causes shortage in water supply leading to the rationing of water in some situations, shortage in hydropower supply, and food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How El Niño could affect the Philippines in 2015|url = http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/73542-prepare-drought-less-rainfall-2015|website = Rappler|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LaMesaDamEcopark1.jpg|thumb|312x312px|The [[La Mesa Watershed Reservation|La Mesa Watershed]] is the only remaining rainforest of its size in Metro Manila, Philippines.]]

==== Denudation of Forest Cover ====
The supply of water from most freshwater bodies usually come from watersheds --- patches of [[forest cover]] that absorb rainwater and channel it into streams, rivers, and eventually dams where many human communities (especially Metro Manila) source their freshwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bulacan deforestation ‘drying up’ Metro Manila water supply|url = http://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/60761-ipo-watershed-mismanagement-denr-mwss|website = Rappler|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the role of the forest in the replenishment and maintenance of both ground and surface water, the Philippines is considered to be one of the most severely deforested countries in the tropics as it lost more than 97% of its original forest cover in the last 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.senate.gov.ph/publications/PB%202011-08%20-%20Turning%20the%20Tide.pdf|title = Turning the Tide: Improving Water Resource Management in the Philippines|last = |first = |date = August 2011|journal = Policy Brief: Senate Economic Planning Office|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saltwater Intrusion ====
One of the areas in most risk of saltwater intrusion is Metro Manila. Since the late 1960s, saline water intrusion has been evident along the coastal areas of Metro Manila, stretching from Las Pinas to Malabon. The shallow water table aquifer is in direct contact with the sea in these coastal areas. The over-pumping of groundwater results to [[Cone of depression|cones of depression]] which increase the risk of saltwater intrusion. According to a joint study by MWSS and JICA in 1991, most groundwater samples from Metro Manila’s coastal areas were salinized. However, compared to the early 1980s, saline intrusion was found to have improved conditions because of the conversion of water source from groundwater to surface water upon the completion of the Manila Water Supply Project II in 1987. Aside from excessive withdrawal of groundwater, seepage of [[brackish water]] along the Pasig River is another cause of saltwater intrusion because of seawater movement during tides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://dirp4.pids.gov.ph/ris/ris/pdf/pidsdps0105.PDF|title = Metro Manila and Metro Cebu Groundwater Assessment|last = |first = |date = February 2001|journal = Philippine Institute for Development Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wheelmap.org''' is an online, worldwide map for finding and marking wheelchair [[Accessibility|accessible]] places, developed by the German [[nonprofit organisation]] [[Sozialhelden|Sozialhelden e.V.]] Anyone can find and add public places to the map and rate them according to a simple traffic light system. The map, which is based on [[OpenStreetMap]], was created in 2010 by a team around [[social entrepreneur]] [[Raul Krauthausen]] to help people who use wheelchairs or wheeled walkers to plan their days more easily. Parents pushing a baby carriage can also benefit from the Wheelmap information. Currently almost 600,000 public places worldwide can be found on the map. About 300 new places are added on a daily basis. Wheelmap is available on the website and as an app for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Windows Phone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2011-09/wheelmap-raul-krauthausen wheelmap-raul-krauthausen] (de) in [[Die Zeit|Die Zeit online]]&lt;/ref&gt;
