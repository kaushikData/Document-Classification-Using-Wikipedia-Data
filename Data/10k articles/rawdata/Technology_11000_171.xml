'''Airbiquity Inc.''' is a [[business-to-business]] (B2B) software development and engineering company operating in the automotive [[telematics]] industry. Airbiquity’s business model is to develop, deploy, and support the ongoing management of [[connected car]] programs for automotive industry customers using a [[software-as-a-service]] (SaaS) business model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koslowski|first1=Thilo|title=Ford Shifts Vehicle Hub Concept Into High Gear|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/624907/ford-shifts-vehicle-hub-concept|website=Gartner|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its Choreo cloud-based connected car service delivery platform.

Airbiquity’s Choreo platform is claimed by the company to integrate the broad array of components needed to build and operate connected car programs such as mobile network connectivity; vehicle entertainment systems or "head units", cabin displays and instrumentation; [[Telematic control unit|telematics control units]] (TCU), [[On-board diagnostics|on-board diagnostic]] dongles (OBD-II), smart-phone handsets; back-office IT systems; data analytics providers; software and firmware over-the-air (OTA) technology providers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jonston|first1=Bryan|title=Best of CES Connected Car News: AT&amp;T, Qualcomm, Audi, HERE, BMW, Ford, Airbiquity &amp; Arynga|url=http://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2016/01/best-of-ces-connected-car-news-att-qualcomm-audi-here-bmw-ford-airbiquity-arynga/|website=Auto Connected Car|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kumbhar|first1=Sheetal|title=Airbiquity and Arynga to make connected car software updates as seamless as consumer electronics|url=http://www.iot-now.com/2016/01/08/40739-airbiquity-and-arynga-partner-to-make-connected-car-software-updates-as-seamless-as-consumer-electronics/|website=IoT Now|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; software and firmware catalogs; emergency and concierge call centers; and content and service providers.

== History  ==
The company was founded in 1997 as Integrated Data Communications Inc. located on Bainbridge Island across the [[Puget Sound]] from [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Sharon|title=Airbiquity raises $7.5M to back wireless GPS system|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2000/12/25/story4.html|website=Puget Sounds Business Journal|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the company changed its name to Airbiquity Inc. and later relocated to the Seattle downtown waterfront in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Engleman|first1=Eric|title=Deal with GM's OnStar saves Seattle's Airbiquity|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2006/05/15/focus3.html|website=Portland Business Journal|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its early years Airbiquity’s primary product was aqLink, a patented in-band [[software modem]] enabling vehicle connectivity and two-way data transfer over cellular voice networks using embedded TCUs or consumer cell phones with [[Bluetooth]] connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gill|first1=Sharon|title=Airbiquity deploys 10 million telematics solutions|url=http://analysis.tu-auto.com/fleet-and-asset-management/airbiquity-deploys-10-million-telematics-solutions|website=TU-Automotive|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of aqLink was followed by a series of product upgrades and line extensions, including aqServer for transmission, receipt and processing of information transported to data and call center providers over [[UMTS]], [[CDMA]], [[Time-division multiple access|TDMA]] or [[GSM]] wireless network voice channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gill|first1=Sharon|title=America News: Airbiquity signs telematics deal with BMW|url=http://analysis.tu-auto.com/infotainment/america-news-airbiquity-signs-telematics-deal-bmw|website=TU Automotive|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Airbiquity secured a contract with [[General Motors]] to license aqLink technology to support location-based communications for its [[OnStar]] service. Other automakers licensed aqLink technology for their connected car programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shariat|first1=Jeff|title=Product Spotlight: Airbiquity aqLink|url=http://intelematicstoday.com/2010/02/24/product-spotlight-airbiquity-aqlink/|accessdate=22 February 2016|publisher=InTelematicsToday|date=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Airbiquity, aqLink technology has been licensed for use in over 25 million production vehicles globally.&lt;ref name="choreo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Airbiquity: "Choreo Is Used by Nissan, Infiniti, FCA, Ford and Renault"|url=http://www.gpsbusinessnews.com/Airbiquity-Choreo-Is-Used-by-Nissan-Infiniti-FCA-Ford-and-Renault_a5379.html|website=GPS Business News|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to provide voice and data services marked the start of branded connected car programs from automakers seeking to differentiate their vehicles from competitors. These programs have since expanded to include other features and services such as over-the-air (OTA) software and data management, infotainment delivery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arnason|first1=Gulli|url=http://www.financial-news.co.uk/33874/2016/03/airbiquity-integrates-vehicle-infotainment-applications/|website=Financial News|title=Airbiquity integrates vehicle infotainment applications|accessdate=15 April 2016|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; remote vehicle management, electric vehicle management, and commercial fleet management.

==Choreo==
Airbiquity launched Choreo, a cloud-based connected car service delivery platform, in 2008. The first automaker program to deploy on Choreo was [[Ford Sync]] in 2008. Airbiquity provides service delivery for Choreo in over 60 countries, including translations into more than 30 local languages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Kelly|title=Airbiquity provides cloud-based smartphone integration for Nissan vehicles|url=http://www.rcrwireless.com/20131115/wireless/airbiquity-provides-cloud-based-smartphone-integration-for-nissan-vehicles|website=RCR Wireless|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choreo is composed of six services for established and newly emerging connected car services. Each product draws upon combinations of Choreo platform service delivery capability supplemented with custom software development and engineering to integrate with specified suppliers, [[mobile network operators]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Costlow|first1=Terry|title=AT&amp;T, Airbiquity team up for connected-vehicle services|url=http://articles.sae.org/13978/|website=SAE International|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[call centers]], [[content providers]], and back-end [[IT systems]].

'''Aker Drilling''', was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[drilling rig]] operation [[company]]; based in [[Stavanger]], Norway and majority owned by the [[Aker ASA|Aker Group]]. It was listed on [[Oslo Stock Exchange]] under the ticker - 'AKD'. 

In October 2011, it was amalgamated into global operations of [[Transocean]] and renamed to '''Transocean Norway Drilling AS''', after the completion of the US$1.43 billion acquisition of Aker Drilling by Transocean Ltd.

==History==
There was previously in the 1970s a different company called Aker Drilling, also part of the Aker Group, which later became part of [[Fred. Olsen Energy]]. 

The history of the 2005 established Aker drilling is as follows;

===Inception and expansion : 2005-2011===
Aker drilling was established in 2005, as part of the [[Aker ASA|Aker Group]] controlled by the Norwegian billionaire [[Kjell Inge Røkke]]. The purpose of the new company was to place contracts for its two new-building [[semi-submersible]] drilling rigs. The two Aker H-6e type 6th generation [[semi-submersible]]s - ''[[Aker Barents]]'' and ''[[Aker Spitsbergen]]'', were designed by [[Aker Solutions]] and being built at [[Aker Stord]] AS shipyard.&lt;ref name=AK-TA-H-04/&gt; 

[[File:Aker Spitsbergen.JPG|thumb|Aker Spitsbergen semi-sumersible at Aker Stord shipyard]]
In December 2005, Aker drilling went public and was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. In 2006, with the Aker Drilling’s management team in place, the company set up its head office in Stavanger, Norway. The same year, it secured long term contracts with [[Statoil]] ASA and [[Aker Exploration ASA]] (later merged with [[Det Norske Oljeselskap ASA]]).

In 2007, it was taken off the exchange to avoid a takeover by billionaire [[John Fredriksen]]’s [[Seadrill]], which made a voluntary offer for all outstanding shares in Aker Drilling.&lt;ref name=AK-TA-H-02/&gt; Aker ASA, through its wholly owned subsidiary [[Aker Capital]] ASA, made a voluntary acquisition of a majority stake in Aker drilling, which subsequently led to the de-listing of the company in March 2008.&lt;ref name=AK-TA-H-01/&gt;

In 2009, the company took ownership of the semi submersibles - Aker Barents and Aker Spitsbergen. Aker Barents subsequently commenced drilling operations on the Norwegian continental shelf for [[Det Norske Oljeselskap ASA]] (earlier Aker Exploration ASA) in July 2009.&lt;ref name=AK-TA-H-05/&gt; And in 2010, Aker Spitsbergen commenced drilling operations for [[Statoil]] ASA.&lt;ref name=AK-TA-H-06/&gt;

In February 2011, Aker drilling was relisted in the Oslo stock exchange under the ticker - 'AKD', three years after being taken off the exchange.&lt;ref name=AK-TA-H-07/&gt;

=== Acquisition by Transocean : 2011===
On 15 August 2010, [[Transocean]] made a US$1.43&amp;nbsp;billion takeover bid for Aker Drilling. Under the transaction, Transocean made a voluntary NOK26.50 ($4.83) per share cash offer for all outstanding shares in the company.&lt;ref name=AK-TA-H-02/&gt;&lt;ref name=AK-TA-H-01/&gt;&lt;ref name=dowjones150811&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The company was delisted after the take over was completed in October 2011, and it was renamed '''Transocean Norway Drilling AS''' - a wholly owned subsidiary of Transocean.&lt;ref name=AK-TA-H-03/&gt; Aker Drilling used [[Goldman Sachs]] group Inc as its financial adviser, while Transocean was advised by [[Morgan Stanley]] and Fearnley Fonds AS.&lt;ref name=AK-TA-H-02/&gt;&lt;ref name=AK-TA-H-07/&gt;

'''Ambient devices''' are a type of consumer electronics, characterized by their ability to be perceived at-a-glance, also known as "glanceable". Ambient devices use pre-attentive processing to display information{{Sfn|Ziegler|2012|p=}} and are aimed at minimizing mental effort. Associated fields include [[Ubiquitous Computing|ubiquitous computing]] and [[calm technology]]. The concept is closely related to the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]].{{Sfn|Daecher|Galizia|2015|p=}}

''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' announced ambient devices as one of its Ideas of the Year in 2002. The award recognized a start-up company, [[Ambient Devices]], whose first product Ambient Orb, was a frosted-glass ball lamp, which maps information to a linear color spectrum and displays the trend in the data. Other products in the genre include the 2008 [[Chumby]], and the 2012 52-[[LED]] device MooresCloud (a reference to [[Moore's Law]]) from Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/12/vrml_pioneer_mark_pesce_invents_cloud_lights//|title=VR pioneer invents 'illumination-as-a-service'|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on ambient devices began at [[Xerox Parc]], with a paper co-written by [[Mark Weiser]] and [[John Seely Brown]], entitled ''Calm Computing''. 

==Purpose==

The purpose of ambient devices is to enable immediate and effortless access to information. The original developers of the idea{{Sfn|HYATT|ROSE|2002|p=}} state that an ambient device is designed to provide support to people carrying out everyday activities. Ambient devices decrease the effort needed to process incoming data, thus rendering individuals more productive.{{Sfn|Rose|2002|p=}}

The key issue lies with taking Internet-based content (e.g. traffic congestion, weather condition, stock market quotes) and mapping it into a single, usually one-dimensional spectrum (e.g. angle, colour). According to Rose, this presents data to an end user seamlessly, with an insignificant amount of [[cognitive load]].

==History==

The concept of ambient devices can be traced back to the early 2000s, when preliminary research was carried at Xerox PARC, according to the company’s official website. The [[MIT Media Lab's CityCar|MIT Media Lab]] website lists the venture as founded by David L. Rose, Ben Resner, Nabeel Hyatt and Pritesh Gandhi as a lab spin-off.

==Examples==

Ambient Orb was introduced by Ambient Devices in 2002.{{Sfn|KIRSNER|2002|p=}} The device was a glowing sphere that displayed data through changes in color. Ambient Orb was customizable in terms of content and its subsequent visual representation. For instance, when the device was set to monitor a [[stock market]] index (e.g. [[NASDAQ]]), the Orb glowed green/red to represent the upward/downward price movements; alternatively, it turned amber when the index is unchanged. Nabeel Hyatt stated that the device was marketed as an interior design item with additional functionality.

Another prominent ambient device is Chumby, released in 2008. It served as an at-a-glance widget station. Chumby was able to push relevant customizable data (weather, news, music, photos) to a touchscreen through Wi-Fi.{{Sfn|LYONS|2008|p=}} It greatly surpassed the products resembling Ambient Orb, in terms of functionality, and was proclaimed one of the top gadgets of 2008,{{Sfn|DUMAS|SORRELL|2008|p=}} production ceased in April 2012. Since 1 July 2014 Chumby is available only as a paid subscription service.{{Sfn|WELCH|2013|p=}}

More recent products such as [[Amazon Alexa]] can be seen as adopting the spirit of ambient devices, in that they operate in the background, responding to both users and external data sources.

'''''Apocynum cannabinum''''' ('''dogbane''', '''amy root''', '''hemp dogbane''', '''prairie dogbane''', '''Indian hemp''', '''rheumatism root''', or '''wild cotton''')&lt;ref&gt;{{ITIS|id=30157 |taxon=Apocynum cannabinum}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[perennial]] [[herbaceous]] plant that grows throughout much of [[North America]] - in the southern half of [[Canada]] and throughout the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=p/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{BONAP|ref |genus=Apocynum |species=cannabinum}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is a [[poison]]ous plant: ''Apocynum'' means "poisonous to dogs". All parts of the plant are poisonous and can cause cardiac arrest if ingested. However, some [[lepidoptera]] feed on this plant, such as two hummingbird moths.&lt;ref name=FS.FED.US&gt;{{cite web|title=Hummingbird Moth (Hemaris spp.)|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/pollinators/pollinator-of-the-month/hummingbird_moth.shtml|accessdate=July 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''''cannabinum''''' in the scientific name and the common names '''hemp dogbane''' and '''Indian hemp''' refer to its similarity to ''[[Cannabis]]'' as a fiber plant (see [[Hemp]]), rather than as a source of a psychoactive drug (see [[Cannabis (drug)]])

Although dogbane is poisonous to livestock, it likely got its name from its resemblance to a European species of the same name.&lt;ref name=heiser&gt;{{cite book | author = Heiser, C. B. | title = Weeds in my Garden: Observations on some Misunderstood Plants | year = 2003 | publisher = Timber Press | location = Portland, OR | page = 50 | isbn = 0-88192-562-4 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nN1ohECdSC8C&amp;pg=PA50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
''Apocynum cannabinum'' grows in open [[woodland|wooded]] areas, ditches, and hillsides. It is found in [[gravel]]ly or [[sand]]y soil, mainly near streams in [[shade (shadow)|shady]] or moist places.&lt;ref name=pfaf&gt;{{PFAF |accessdate=Jan 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Apocynum cannabinum'' grows up to 2 meters/6 feet tall. The [[plant stem|stem]]s are reddish and contain a milky [[latex]] capable of causing skin [[blister]]s. The [[leaves]] are [[opposite leaf|opposite]], [[simple leaf|simple]] broad [[lanceolate]], {{cvt|7|–|15|cm|in|frac=4}} long and {{cvt|3|–|5|cm|in|frac=4}} broad, entire, and smooth on top with white hairs on the underside. It [[flower]]s from July to August, has large [[sepal]]s, and a five-lobed white [[corolla (botany)|corolla]]. The flowers are [[Hermaphrodite (botany)|hermaphrodite]] (have both male and female organs) and are [[pollinated]] by [[moth]]s and [[butterflies]].&lt;ref name=pfaf/&gt;

==Uses==
The plant serves as a larval host for the snowberry clearwing (''[[Hemaris diffinis]]'') and hummingbird clearwing (''[[Hemaris thysbe]]'') moths. These moths are pollinators that resemble small hummingbirds. The plant can be used for various purposes. The most used parts are the seeds, the root and the bark.

==Potentially aggressive or unwanted species==
This species is native to [[North America]]. However, in [[garden]]s it can be unwanted, growing from spreading roots.  When growing among corn, ''Apocynum cannabinum'' can reduce yields by up to 10% and when growing among soybeans, by up to 40%.  It can be controlled through mechanical means, although it is difficult to control with herbicides.

===Fiber===
A very strong and good quality [[fiber]] obtained from the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] is a [[flax]] substitute that does not shrink and retains its strength in [[water]].&lt;ref name=pfaf/&gt; It is used for making [[clothes]], [[twine]], [[bag]]s, [[linen]], [[paper]], etc.&lt;ref name=pfaf/&gt; The plant yields a latex which is a possible source of [[rubber]].&lt;ref name=pfaf/&gt; 
''Apocynum cannabinum'' was used as a source of fiber by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Coville, F. V. | year = 1897 | title = Notes On The Plants Used By The Klamath Indians Of Oregon | journal = Contributions from the U.S. National Herbarium | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–108 (p. 103) | url = http://soda.sou.edu/awdata/020612a1.pdf | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; to make hunting nets, fishing lines, clothing, and [[twine]].&lt;ref name=heiser/&gt;  It is called ''qéemu'' {{IPA-sal|qǽːmu|}} in [[Nez Perce language|Nez Perce]] and {{IPA-sal|taxʷɨ́s|}} in [[Sahaptin language|Sahaptin]]. The [[Maidu#Local divisions|Concow tribe]] call the plant '''pö''' ([[Konkow language]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chesnut | first1 = V. K. | title = Plants used by the Indians of Mendocino County, California | journal = Contributions from the U.S. National Herbarium | year = 1902 | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 295–408 (p. 407) | lccn = 08010527 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vLkUAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====String and cordage====
The plant can be [[harvest]]ed for [[fiber]], which can be used to make strong string and [[Rope|cordage]] for use in [[Bow and arrow|bows]], [[Bow drill|fire-bows]], [[Net (device)|nets]] and [[tie down straps]].  When harvested for fiber, dogbane is often left standing as late as mid-winter so that rain and snow will perform [[retting]].

===Food===
The [[seeds]] have an edible use as a meal (raw or cooked) when ground into a powder.&lt;ref name=pfaf/&gt;

===Chewing gum===
After the [[latex]] has been squeezed from the plant, it is allowed to stand overnight to harden into a white [[natural gum|gum]] which can be used (sometimes mixed with clean [[clay]]) as [[chewing gum]].&lt;ref name=pfaf/&gt;

===Phytoremediation===
''Apocynum cannabinum'' is a [[phytoremediation]] plant, a [[hyperaccumulator]] used to sequester [[lead]] in its [[biomass]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} {{technical statement|date=June 2015}}

===Medicinal===
It is also used in [[herbal medicine]] to treat [[fever]],&lt;ref name=felter&gt;{{cite book |last=Felter |first=Harvey |date=1922 |title=The Eclectic Materia Medica, Pharmacology and Therapeutics |url=http://www.henriettes-herb.com/eclectic/felter/apocynum-cann.html |publisher=Eclectic Medical Publications |isbn=1888483032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dysentery]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Although the toxins from the plant can cause [[nausea]] and [[catharsis]]{{dubious|date=March 2015}}, it has also been used for slowing the pulse,&lt;ref name=felter/&gt; and it is also a [[sedative]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and mild [[hypnotic]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} It is an unpleasantly bitter stimulant irritant herb that acts on the [[heart]], [[respiratory system|respiratory]] and [[urinary system]]s, and also on the [[uterus]]. ''Apocynum cannabinum'' was much employed by various [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes who used it to treat a wide variety of complaints including [[rheumatism]], [[cough]]s, [[poxvirus|pox]], [[whooping cough]], [[asthma]], [[Human parasite|internal parasites]], [[diarrhoea]] and also to increase [[milk]] flow in lactating mothers.&lt;ref name=pfaf/&gt; The root has been used as a tonic, [[cardiotonic]], [[diaphoretic]], [[diuretic]], [[emetic]] (induces [[vomitting]]) and [[expectorant]].&lt;ref name=felter/&gt;&lt;ref name=pfaf/&gt; It is harvested in the [[autumn]] and dried for later use. The fresh root is the most active part medicinally.&lt;ref name=pfaf/&gt; A weak [[herbal tea|tea]] made from the dried root has been used for [[cardiac disease]]s and also as a [[vermifuge]] (an agent that expels [[parasitic worms]]).&lt;ref name=pfaf/&gt; The milky sap is a (presumably [[topical]]ly applied) [[folk remedy]] for [[venereal warts]].&lt;ref name=pfaf/&gt; The plant is still used in modern [[herbalism]], though it should be used with great caution and only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner if taken internally.

'''Sir Arthur John Dorman, 1st Baronet''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] (8 August 1848 – 12 February 1931) was an important [[United Kingdom|British]] [[industrialist]].

==Early life==
He was born at [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] in [[Kent]] the son of Charles Dorman and Emma Page and educated at [[Christ's Hospital]], then situated in [[Newgate]], London.

==Career==
He was sent, at the age of 22, by his family to work at a [[Stockton-on-Tees]] iron works where a relative was a partner.  Dorman started as a [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddler]] and rapidly progressed in his career.  In 1875, he went into partnership with [[Albert de Lande Long]] to acquire the ''West Marsh'' Ironworks in [[Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/46885 Arthur John Dorman at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1880s they exploited the new steel making technologies being introduced at that time including use of [[Open hearth furnace]]s.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;  Together they built a large industrial concern, [[Dorman Long]], which by 1914 employed 20,000 people and during the [[World War I]] was a major supplier of shells.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Stood as the Conservative candidate for [[Cleveland (UK Parliament constituency)|Cleveland]].

Arthur Dorman was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) in 1918&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30460 |date=7 January 1918 |page=366 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history/&gt; and created a [[baronet]] of [[Nunthorpe]] in the [[County of York]] on 21 July 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=32849 |date=31 July 1923 |page=5238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighrayment.com/baronetage/baronetsD2.htm Leigh's Baronetage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

He married Clara Lockwood in 1873 and together they had four sons and three daughters.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; His youngest son George Lockwood Dorman was killed in the [[Second Boer War]], and is commemorated in the [[Dorman Museum]].

Sir Arthur Dorman died in 1931 at Grey Towers, his home in [[Nunthorpe]]&lt;ref name=history/&gt; near Middlesbrough.
His title was inherited by his eldest son Bedford Lockwood Dorman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3989">In [[combustion]], '''Burke–Schumann limit''' (or '''Large Damköhler number limit''') describes the limit of infinitely fast chemistry (or in other words, infinite [[Damköhler numbers|Damköhler number]]), named after S.P. Burke and T.E.W. Schumann,&lt;ref&gt;Burke, S. P., and T. E. W. Schumann. "Diffusion flames." Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry 20.10 (1928): 998–1004.&lt;/ref&gt; due to their pioneering work on [[Burke-Schumann flame]]. One important conclusion of infinitely fast chemistry is the non-co-existence of fuel and oxidizer simultaneously except in a thin reaction sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (2018). Combustion theory. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linan, A., &amp; Williams, F. A. (1993). Fundamental aspects of combustion.&lt;/ref&gt; The inner structure of the reaction sheet is described by [[Liñán's equation#Large Damköhler number|Liñán's equation]].

==Limit description==
In a typical non-premixed combustion (fuel and oxidizer are separated initially), mixing of fuel and oxidizer takes place based on the mechanical time scale &lt;math&gt;t_m&lt;/math&gt;dictated by the convection/diffusion (the relative importance between convection and diffusion depends on the [[Reynolds number]]) terms.&lt;ref&gt;Liñán, A. (2001). Diffusion-controlled combustion. In Mechanics for a New Mellennium (pp. 487-502). Springer, Dordrecht.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, chemical reaction takes certain amount of time &lt;math&gt;t_c&lt;/math&gt; to consume reactants. For one-step irreversible chemistry with [[Arrhenius law|Arrhenius rate]], this chemical time is given by

:&lt;math&gt;t_c = \left(B e^{-\frac E {RT}}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|B}} is the [[pre-exponential factor]], {{mvar|E}} is the [[activation energy]], {{mvar|R}} is the [[universal gas constant]] and {{mvar|T}} is the temperature. Similarly, one can define &lt;math&gt;t_m&lt;/math&gt; appropriate for particular flow configuration. The [[Damköhler numbers|Damköhler number]] is then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Da} = \frac{t_m}{t_c} = t_m B e^{-\frac E {RT}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Due to the large activation energy, the Damköhler number at unburnt gas temperature &lt;math&gt;T_u&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Da}_u \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;\frac E {RT_u} \sim 100&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, the shortest chemical time is found at the flame (with burnt gas temperature &lt;math&gt;T_b&lt;/math&gt;), leading to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Da}_b \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;. Regardless of [[Reynolds number]], the limit &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Da}_b\rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; guarantees that chemical reaction dominates over the other terms. A typical conservation equation for the scalar &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; (species concentration or energy) takes the following form,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\psi) = \mathrm{Da}_b Y_F Y_O e^{-\frac E {RT}+\frac E {RT_b}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the convective-diffusive operator and &lt;math&gt;Y_F\ \&amp;\ Y_O&lt;/math&gt; are the [[mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]]s of fuel and oxidizer, respectively. Taking the limit &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Da}_b\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; in the above equation, we find that

:&lt;math&gt;Y_F Y_O =0&lt;/math&gt;,

i.e., fuel and oxidizer cannot coexist, since far away from the reaction sheet, only one of the reactant is available (non premixed). On the fuel side of the reaction sheet, &lt;math&gt;Y_O=0&lt;/math&gt; and on the oxidizer side, &lt;math&gt;Y_F=0&lt;/math&gt;. Fuel and oxygen can coexist (with very small concentrations) only in a thin reaction sheet, where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Da}\sim O(1)&lt;/math&gt; (diffuisve transport will be comparable to reaction in this zone). In this thin reaction sheet, both fuel and oxygen are consumed and nothing leaks to the other side of the sheet. Due to the instantaneous consumption of fuel and oxidizer, the normal gradients of scalars exhibit discontinuities at the reaction sheet.

'''CQD''' (transmitted in [[Morse code]] as {{morse|dash|dot|dash|dot}}{{morse|dash|dash|dot|dash}}{{morse|dash|dot|dot}}) is one of the first [[distress signals]] adopted for [[radio]] use. It was announced on 7 January 1904, by [http://www.earlyradiohistory.us/1913dist.htm "Circular 57"] of the [[Marconi Company|Marconi International Marine Communication Company]], and became effective beginning 1 February 1904 for Marconi installations.

Land [[telegraph]]s had traditionally used [[CQ (call)|"CQ"]] (''"{{lang|fr|sécu|italics=unset}}"'', from the French word ''{{lang|fr|sécurité}}'')&lt;ref&gt;Le Robert &amp; Collins Senior (2002), ''Dictionnaire français-anglais, anglais-français'', Paris: Dictionnaires Le Robert-VUEF. re: '''''sécurité''''' : e.g. ''des mesures de sécurité'', "safety measures, precautions, or alerts"&lt;/ref&gt; to identify alert or precautionary messages of interest to all stations along a telegraph line, and CQ had also been adopted as a "general call" for maritime radio use.  However, in landline usage there was no general emergency signal, so the Marconi company added a "D" ("distress") to CQ in order to create its distress call.  Sending "D" was already used internationally to indicate an urgent message. Thus, "CQD" is understood by wireless operators to mean, "All stations: distress." Contrary to popular belief, CQD does not stand for "Come Quick, Danger", "Come Quickly: Distress", "Come Quick – Drowning!", or "C Q Danger" ("Seek You, Danger"); these are [[backronym]]s.&lt;ref name=Campbell218&gt;Campbell, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Although used worldwide by Marconi operators, CQD was never adopted as an international standard, since it could be mistaken for a general call "CQ" if the reception were poor. At the second International Radiotelegraphic Convention, held in Berlin in 1906, Germany's ''{{lang|de|Notzeichen}}'' distress signal of three-dots/three-dashes/three-dots ({{morse|dot|dot|dot|dash|dash|dash|dot|dot|dot}}) was adopted as the international Morse code distress signal. (This distress signal soon became known as "[[SOS]]" because if gaps are inserted it can be thought of as the Morse codes for those letters – by contrast CQD is transmitted as three distinct letters with a short gap between each. Germany had first adopted this distress signal in regulations effective 1 April 1905.){{cn|date=January 2016}}

Between 1899 and 1908, nine documented rescues were made by the use of wireless. The earliest of these was a distress call from the ''East Goodwin'' lightship.  However, for the earliest of these, there was no standardized distress signal. The first US ship to send a wireless distress call in 1905 simply sent HELP (in both International Morse and [[American Morse]]).&lt;ref name=Campbell218/&gt; By February 1904, the Marconi Wireless Company required all its operators to use CQD for a ship in distress or for requiring URGENT assistance.{{cn|date=January 2016}} In the early morning of 23 January 1909, whilst sailing into New York from Liverpool, [[RMS Republic (1903)|RMS ''Republic'']] collided with the Italian liner SS ''Florida'' in fog off the island of [[Nantucket]], [[Massachusetts]], United States. Radio Operator Jack Binns&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jackbinns.org/jack_binns Jack Binns: Hero] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618112145/http://www.jackbinns.org/jack_binns |date=2009-06-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; sent the CQD distress signal by [[wireless]] transmission.

On April 15, 1912, [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] radio operator [[Jack Phillips (wireless officer)|Jack Phillips]] initially sent "CQD", which was still commonly used by British ships. [[Harold Bride]], the junior radio operator, suggested using "SOS", saying half-jokingly that it might be his last chance to use the new code. Phillips thereafter began to alternate between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2008: 1911)&lt;/ref&gt; Though Bride survived the sinking, Phillips did not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3032">In [[electronics]], '''complex gain''' is the effect that circuitry has on the [[amplitude]] and [[phase (waves)|phase]] of a [[sine wave]] signal. The term ''complex'' is used because mathematically this effect can be expressed as a [[complex number]].

==LTI systems==
Considering the general [[Linear time-invariant theory|LTI system]]

:&lt;math&gt; P(D)x = Q(D)f(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the input and &lt;math&gt;P(D), Q(D)&lt;/math&gt; are given polynomial operators, while assuming that &lt;math&gt;P(s)\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
In case that &lt;math&gt;f(r) = F_0\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;, a particular solution to given equation is

:&lt;math&gt;x_p(t) = \operatorname{Re}\Big ( F_0 \frac{Q(i\omega)}{P(i\omega)}e^{i\omega t}\Big).&lt;/math&gt;

Let us consider the following concepts used in physics and signal processing mainly.

:&lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt; The amplitude of the input is &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt;. This has the same units as the input quantity.
:&lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt; The angular frequency of the input is &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. It has units of radian/time. Often we will be casual and refer to it as frequency, even though technically frequency should have units of cycles/time.

:&lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt; The amplitude of the response is &lt;math&gt;A = F_0|Q(i\omega)/P(i\omega)|&lt;/math&gt;. This has the same units as the response quantity. 
:&lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt; The gain is &lt;math&gt;g(\omega) = |Q(i\omega)/P (i\omega)|&lt;/math&gt;. The gain is the factor that the input amplitude is multiplied by to get the amplitude of the response. It has the units needed to convert
input units to output units.
:&lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt; The phase lag is &lt;math&gt;\phi = -\operatorname{Arg}(Q(i\omega)/P(i\omega))&lt;/math&gt;. The phase lag has units of radians, i.e. it’s dimensionless.
:&lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt; The time lag is &lt;math&gt; \phi / \omega&lt;/math&gt;. This has units of time. It is the time that peak of the output lags behind that of the input.
:&lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt; The complex gain is &lt;math&gt;Q(i\omega)/P(i\omega)&lt;/math&gt;. This is the factor that the complex input is multiplied by to get the complex output.

==Example==
Suppose a circuit has an input voltage described by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;V_{i}(t) = 1V \cdot \sin (\omega \cdot t)&lt;/math&gt;

where ω equals 2π&amp;times;100Hz, i.e., the input signal is a 100Hz sine wave with an amplitude of 1 Volt.

If the circuit is such that for this frequency it doubles the signal's amplitude and causes a 90 degrees forward phase shift, then its output signal can be described by

:&lt;math&gt;V_{o}(t) = 2V \cdot \cos (\omega \cdot t)&lt;/math&gt;

In complex notation, these signals can be described as, for this frequency, ''j''·1V and 2V, respectively.

The complex gain ''G'' of this circuit is then computed by dividing output by input:

:&lt;math&gt;G = \frac {2V}{j\cdot1V} = -2j.&lt;/math&gt;

This (unitless) complex number incorporates both the magnitude of the change in amplitude (as the [[Absolute_value#Complex_numbers|absolute value]]) and the phase change (as the [[Argument (complex analysis)|argument]]).

'''Computing''' is any activity that uses [[computer]]s. It includes developing [[computer hardware|hardware]]  and [[software]], and using computers to manage and process information, communicate and entertain. Computing is a critically important, integral component of modern industrial technology. Major computing disciplines include [[computer engineering]], [[software engineering]], [[computer science]], [[information system]]s, and [[information technology]].

==Definitions==

The [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] ''Computing Curricula 2005''&lt;ref name=curricula&gt;{{cite web|author=The Joint Task Force for Computing Curricula 2005|url=http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf|title=Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report|format=pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021153204/http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined "computing" as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In a general way, we can define computing to mean any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computers. Thus, computing includes designing and building hardware and software systems for a wide range of purposes; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific studies using computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; creating and using communications and entertainment media; finding and gathering information relevant to any particular purpose, and so on. The list is virtually endless, and the possibilities are vast."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and it defines five sub-disciplines of the ''computing'' field: [[computer science]], [[computer engineering]], [[information system]]s, [[information technology]], and [[software engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations |title=Curricula Recommendations |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |year=2005 |accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''Computing Curricula 2005''&lt;ref name=curricula/&gt; also recognizes that the meaning of "computing" depends on the context:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Computing also has other meanings that are more specific, based on the context in which the term is used. For example, an information systems specialist will view computing somewhat differently from a software engineer. Regardless of the context, doing computing well can be complicated and difficult. Because society needs people to do computing well, we must think of computing not only as a profession but also as a discipline.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "computing" has sometimes been narrowly defined, as in a 1989 [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] report on ''Computing as a Discipline'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://cs.gmu.edu/cne/pjd/GP/CompDisc.pdf |title=Computing as a Discipline |format=PDF |date=January 1989 |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |work=[[Communications of the ACM]] |author=Peter J.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The discipline of computing is the systematic study of algorithmic
processes that describe and transform information: their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, implementation, and application. The fundamental question underlying all computing is "What can be (efficiently) automated?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "computing" is also [[synonymous]] with counting and calculating. In earlier times, it was used in reference to the action performed by [[Mechanical computer|mechanical computing machines]], and before that, to [[human computer]]s {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

== History ==
{{Main|History of computing|Timeline of computing}}

The history of computing is longer than the [[history of computing hardware]] and [[computer|modern computing technology]] and includes the history of methods intended for pen and paper or for chalk and slate, with or without the aid of tables.

Computing is intimately tied to the representation of [[number]]s. But long before [[abstraction]]s like ''the number'' arose, there were mathematical concepts to serve the purposes of civilization. These concepts include [[one-to-one correspondence]] (the basis of counting), comparison to a standard (used for measurement), and the ''3-4-5'' right triangle (a device for assuring a ''right angle'').

The earliest known tool for use in computation was the [[abacus]], and it was thought to have been invented in [[Babylon]] circa 2400 BC. Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles. Abaci, of a more modern design, are still used as calculation tools today. This was the first known calculation aid - preceding Greek methods by 2,000 years{{citation needed|reason=What Greek methods?|date=March 2018}}.

The first recorded idea of using digital electronics for computing was the 1931 paper "The Use of Thyratrons for High Speed Automatic Counting of Physical Phenomena" by [[C. E. Wynn-Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wynn-Williams | first = C. E. | author-link = C. E. Wynn-Williams | title = The Use of Thyratrons for High Speed Automatic Counting of Physical Phenomena | journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | volume = 132 | issue = 819 | pages = 295–310 | date = July 2, 1931 | doi = 10.1098/rspa.1931.0102 |bibcode = 1931RSPSA.132..295W }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claude Shannon]]'s 1938 paper "[[A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits]]" then introduced the idea of using electronics for [[Boolean algebra]]ic operations.

== Computer ==
{{Main|Computer|Outline of computers|Glossary of computer terms}}

A computer is a [[machine]] that manipulates [[Data (computing)|data]] according to a set of [[Source code|instructions]] called a [[computer program]].  The program has an [[Execution (computing)|executable]] form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions.  The same program in its human-readable [[source code]] form, enables a [[programmer]] to study and develop a sequence of steps known as an [[algorithm]]. Because the instructions can be carried out in different types of computers, a single set of source instructions converts to machine instructions according to the [[central processing unit]] type.

The execution [[process (computing)|process]] carries out the instructions in a computer program. Instructions express the [[computation]]s performed by the computer. They trigger sequences of simple actions on the executing machine. Those actions produce effects according to the [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]] of the instructions.

=== Computer software and hardware ===
{{Main|Software|Computer hardware}}

Computer software or just "software", is a collection of [[computer program]]s and related [[data]] that provides the instructions for telling a [[computer]] what to do and how to do it. Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer for some purposes. In other words, software is a set of ''programs, procedures, algorithms'' and its ''documentation'' concerned with the operation of a data processing system. Program software performs the [[Function (engineering)|function]] of the [[Computer program|program]] it implements, either by directly providing [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] to the computer hardware or by serving as input to another piece of software. The [[Terminology|term]] was coined to contrast with the old term [[computer hardware|hardware]] (meaning physical devices). In contrast to hardware, software is intangible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Wordreference.com: WordNet 2.0| publisher = Princeton University, Princeton, NJ| url = http://www.wordreference.com/definition/software
| accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense, meaning [[application software]] only.

==== Application software ====
{{Main|Application software}}

Application software, also known as an "application" or an "app", is a [[computer software]] designed to help the user to perform specific tasks. Examples include [[enterprise software]], [[accounting software]], [[office suite]]s, [[graphics software]] and [[media player (application software)|media player]]s.  Many application programs deal principally with [[Document file format|documents]].  Apps may be [[Product bundling|bundled]] with the computer and its system software, or may be published separately.  Some users are satisfied with the bundled apps and need never install one.

Application software is contrasted with [[system software]] and [[middleware]], which manage and integrate a computer's capabilities, but typically do not directly apply them in the performance of tasks that benefit the user.  The system software serves the application, which in turn serves the user.

Application software applies the power of a particular [[computing platform]] or system software to a particular purpose.  Some apps such as [[Microsoft Office]] are available in versions for several different platforms; others have narrower requirements and are thus called, for example, a [[Geographic information system|Geography]] application for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] application for [[Educational software|education]] or [[Linux gaming]].  Sometimes a new and popular application arises that only runs on one platform, increasing the desirability of that platform.  This is called a [[killer application]].

====System software====
{{Main|System software}}

System software, or systems software, is computer software designed to operate and control the computer hardware and to provide a platform for running application software.  System software includes [[operating system]]s, [[utility software]], [[device driver]]s, [[window system]]s, and [[firmware]].  Frequently development tools such as [[compiler]]s, [[linker (computing)|linker]]s, and [[Debugging|debuggers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Game of thrones|last=|first=|last3=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are classified as system software.

=== Computer network ===
{{Main|Computer network}}

A computer network, often simply referred to as a network, is a collection of hardware components and computers '''[[Computer network|interconnected]]''' by communication channels that allow sharing of resources and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atis.org/glossary/definition.aspx?id=6555 |title=Computer network definition |accessdate=2011-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121061919/http://www.atis.org/glossary/definition.aspx?id=6555 |archivedate=2012-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where at least one process in one device is able to send/receive data to/from at least one process residing in a remote device, then the two devices are said to be in a network.

Networks may be classified according to a wide variety of characteristics such as the medium used to transport the data, [[communications protocol]] used, scale, [[Network topology|topology]], and organizational scope.

[[Communications protocol]]s define the rules and data formats for exchanging information in a computer network, and provide the basis for [[computer network programming|network programming]]. Well-known communications protocols are [[Ethernet]], a hardware and [[Link Layer]] standard that is ubiquitous in [[local area network]]s, and the [[Internet Protocol Suite]], which defines a set of protocols for internetworking, i.e. for data communication between multiple networks, as well as host-to-host data transfer, and application-specific data transmission formats.

Computer networking is sometimes considered a sub-discipline of [[electrical engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[computer science]], [[information technology]] or [[computer engineering]], since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of these disciplines.

==== Internet ====

The Internet is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s that use the standard [[Internet protocol suite]] (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of [[information]] resources and services, such as the inter-linked [[hypertext]] documents of the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW) and the [[information infrastructure|infrastructure]] to support [[email]].

=== Computer programming ===
{{Main|Computer programming|Software engineering}}

Computer programming in general is the process of writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code and documentation of [[computer program]]s. This source code is written in a [[programming language]], which is an [[artificial language]] often more restrictive or demanding than [[natural language]]s, but easily translated by the computer. The purpose of programming is to invoke the desired behavior (customization) from the machine. The process of writing high quality source code requires knowledge of both the application's domain  ''and'' the computer science domain.  The highest-quality software is thus developed by a team of various domain experts, each person a specialist in some area of development.  But the term ''programmer'' may apply to a range of program quality, from [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] to [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|open source contributor]] to professional. And a single programmer could do most or all of the computer programming needed to generate the [[proof of concept]] to launch a new [[Killer application|"killer" application]].

==== Computer programmer ====
{{Main|Programmer|Software engineer|Software developer}}

A programmer, computer programmer, or coder is a person who writes [[computer software]]. The term ''computer programmer'' can refer to a specialist in one area of [[computer programming]] or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. One who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst. A programmer's primary computer language ([[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Python programming language|Python]], etc.) is often prefixed to the above titles, and those who work in a web environment often prefix their titles with ''web''. The term ''programmer'' can be used to refer to a [[software developer]], [[software engineer]], [[computer scientist]], or [[software analyst]]. However, members of these [[profession]]s typically{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} possess other [[software engineering]] skills, beyond programming.

=== Computer industry ===
{{Main|Computer industry}}

The computer industry is made up of all of the businesses involved in developing [[computer software]], designing [[computer hardware]] and [[computer networking]] infrastructures, the manufacture of [[computer]] components and the provision of [[information technology]] services including [[System administrator|system administration]] and maintenance.

==== Software industry ====
{{Main|Software industry}}

The software industry includes businesses engaged in [[software development|development]], [[software maintenance|maintenance]] and [[software publisher|publication]] of [[software]]. The industry also includes software [[Service (economics)|service]]s, such as [[training]], [[software documentation|documentation]], and [[consultancy|consulting]].

=={{Anchor|DISCIPLINES}}Sub-disciplines of computing==

=== Computer engineering ===
{{Main|Computer engineering}}

Computer engineering is a [[academic discipline|discipline]] that integrates several fields of [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]] required to develop computer hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1 = IEEE Computer Society | authorlink = IEEE Computer Society |author2=ACM |authorlink2=Association for Computing Machinery  | title = Computer Engineering 2004: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Engineering | url = http://www.acm.org/education/education/curric_vols/CE-Final-Report.pdf | accessdate = 2012-12-17 |date=12 December 2004 | page = iii | quote = Computer System engineering has traditionally been viewed as a combination ofboth electronic engineering (EE) and computer science (CS).|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer engineers usually have training in [[electronic engineering]] (or [[electrical engineering]]), [[software design]], and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual [[microprocessor]]s, [[personal computer]]s, and [[supercomputer]]s, to [[circuit design]]. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, but also how they integrate into the larger picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Consider the car. A modern car contains many separate computer systems for controlling such things as the engine timing, the brakes and the air bags. To be able to design and implement such a car, the computer engineer needs a broad theoretical understanding of all these various subsystems &amp; how they interact.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software engineering ===
{{Main|Software engineering}}

Software engineering (SE) is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of [[software]], and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of [[engineering]] to software.&lt;ref name="BoDu04"&gt;{{harvnb|Abran|Moore|Bourque|Dupuis|2004|pp=1–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = ACM | year = 2006 | url = http://computingcareers.acm.org/?page_id=12 | title = Computing Degrees &amp; Careers | publisher = ACM | accessdate = 2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Laplante | first = Phillip | title = What Every Engineer Should Know about Software Engineering | publisher = CRC | location = Boca Raton   | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-8493-7228-5 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=pFHYk0KWAEgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=What%20Every%20Engineer%20Should%20Know%20about%20Software%20Engineering.&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In layman's terms, it is the act of using insights to conceive, model and scale a solution to a problem.

The generally accepted concepts of Software Engineering as an engineering discipline have been specified in the Guide to the [[Software Engineering Body of Knowledge]] (SWEBOK). The SWEBOK has become an internationally accepted standard ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33897| title = ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005| accessdate = 2012-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer science ===
{{Main|Computer science|Computer scientist}}

Computer science or computing science (abbreviated CS or Comp Sci) is the [[science|scientific]] and practical approach to [[computation]] and its applications. A [[computer scientist]] specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=computer%20scientist |title=WordNet Search - 3.1 |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its subfields can be divided into practical techniques for its implementation and application in [[computer system]]s and purely theoretical areas. Some, such as [[computational complexity theory]], which studies fundamental properties of [[computational problem]]s, are highly abstract, while others, such as [[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]], emphasize real-world applications. Still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations. For example, [[programming language theory]] studies approaches to description of computations, while the study of [[computer programming]] itself investigates various aspects of the use of [[programming language]]s and [[complex systems]], and [[human–computer interaction]] focuses on the challenges in making computers and computations useful, usable, and universally accessible to [[human]]s.

=== Information systems ===

Fiber-optic and photonic (optical) devices, which already have been used to transport data over long distances, have started being used by data centers, side by side with CPU and semiconductor memory components. This allows the separation of RAM from CPU by optical interconnects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/25924/?a=f Tom Simonite, "Computing at the speed of light", ''Technology Review'' Wed., August 4, 2010] [[MIT]]&lt;/ref&gt; IBM has created an [[integrated circuit]] with both electronic and optical information processing in one chip.

'''Converting companies''' are companies that specialize in combining raw materials such as [[polyester]]s, adhesives, [[silicone]], [[adhesive tape]]s, foams, plastics, felts, rubbers, liners and metals, as well as other materials, to create new products.

Materials such as [[paper]], [[plastic film]], foil and cloth often are produced in long, continuous sheets that are rolled up for more convenient handling and transportation.  These rolls of material vary significantly in size and weight — ranging from {{convert|2|-|203|inch|cm|0}} wide and weighing as much as several tons. The converting industry takes these continuous rolls of thin, flat materials — known as webs — threads them through processing machines (such as printing presses, laminating, coating and slitting machines) and converts or changes the web of material into an intermediate form or final product.  For example, a converter’s equipment might take a web of plastic film, cut it into lengths, and fuse their edges, thus converting it into plastic bags.  This activity is known as web processing.

==Processes==
Typical converting processes are coating, laminating and printing. [[Coating]] technologies can include hot melt coating, gravure coating, [[curtain coating]] and slot-die coating. The most common printing techniques are [[flexo]] printing and [[rotogravure]] (gravure) printing. Both print processes are suited to high speed roll-to-roll processing.

Many converting companies will process large diameter, wide rolls of material as this increases the converting efficiency by minimising changes. On completion of the converting process the rolls may be cut into smaller rolls on a [[roll slitting|slitting machine]]. These rolls are then a convenient size for handling on packaging and other machines.  Alternatively, the rolls may be sheeted-cut into sheets — as happens in newspaper and book printing.  Further processes such as collation may occur after sheeting.

==Web alignment==
Web alignment is an important part of a converting operation as a moving web of material has a tendency to track off course and wander out of alignment during the converting processes. To avoid these problems, engineers have developed a variety of automatic web-guiding systems that assure production accuracy and reduce waste. Web-guiding systems typically are positioned just before a critical stage on a converting machine (for example, just before a print station on a printing press).

Each type of [[Web-guiding systems|web guiding system]] uses a sensor to monitor the web position for lateral tracking, and each has an actuator to shift the running web mechanically back on course whenever the sensor detects movement away from the set path. Actuators may be pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, or some kind of electromechanical device. Because the web may be fragile — particularly at its edge — non-contact sensors are used.  These sensors may be [[Pneumatic web guides|pneumatic]], photoelectric, ultrasonic, or infrared. The system’s controls must put the output signals from the sensors in to a form that can drive the actuator. Many controls today are electronic, typically using an amplifier to convert signals from the sensor, then commanding a special servo motor incorporating a lead or ball screw for guiding actuation. The latest web guiding systems have touch screen controls to simplify the setup procedure. Some web guiding systems have been designed specifically for the converting industry.

==Services==
Many converters specialize in 
* Adhesive coating to make [[labels]] and [[adhesive tape]]
* Silicone coating to make a [[release liner]]
* [[Die (manufacturing)|Die]]-cutting materials into finished parts or labels
* Printing services
* [[Roll slitting]] of wide webs into narrow webs or coils
* Laminating services
* [[Vacuum forming]]

==Newer technology==
Some converting companies now incorporate electronics in their finished products.  For example, converters producing [[RFID]] stock labels must incorporate RFID chips and antenna inlays.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.abgint.com/news_archive/05_apr_rfid_converter.html Description of an RFID upgrade at a conversion company] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131016043335/http://www.abgint.com/news_archive/05_apr_rfid_converter.html |date=2013-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The electronic components make up the [[RFID tag]].  The tag stores the information about the items that have been tagged.  These converters therefore sometimes incorporate volume electronics manufacturing practices including controlling static electricity, electronic manufacturing test and similar processes.  Solving some of the issues of inclusion of materials sensitive to external influences has led to more tech companies embracing roll-based manufacturing processes, with particular success in the lithium ion and solar cell manufacturing sectors.&lt;ref name="lithium"&gt;[http://www.universalconvertingequipment.com/lithium-ion-and-solar-cell-manufacturers-increasingly-embracing-web-processes Lithium ion and solar cell manufacturers increasingly embracing converter web processes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paper converting==
{{advert|date=January 2018}}
The process of processing pre-cut cartons or "blanks" and folding them into the appropriate shape to become finished packaging containers is known as tray forming or carton erecting. These machines can create, for example, nacho trays, chinese noodle soup boxes, pizza boxes, french fry trays, hamburger clamshells, etc.

'''DFI''' is an industrial [[computer]] company with headquarters in [[Taipei]], Taiwan. It designs, develops, manufactures, and sells industrial [[motherboard]], [[Industrial PC|industrial PCs]], [[System-on-Module]], industrial displays, and ODM/[[OEM]] services. 

DFI was founded by Y.C Lu on July 14, 1981, developing and selling electronics components and [[add-on cards]] in the beginning. However, DFI switched to the production of motherboards after searching for potential markets and deciding to focus on the strengths of DFI. Targeting the new growing market in motherboard products, DFI announced a Patent License Agreement with [[Intel]] Corporation in 1990 and has been developing and manufacturing motherboard products since 1992. DFI was awarded Top 10 motherboard Manufacturer in CNR Magazine from the year 1997 to 1999.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Starting from 1998, DFI began to follow the strategies of Intel by releasing Intel 440BX series motherboards, 810 motherboards, and 810e motherboards to worldwide markets. For its advances in manufacturing motherboards, DFI was awarded the Intel Global Demo Board manufacturer award in 1998 and 1999.{{cn|date=July 2018}}



Catering to the growing market of high-end motherboards, DFI developed advanced [[overclocking]] motherboards, the LanParty series, which has proven to be a valuable segment for small powerful computers that meet the requirements of end users in the 2000s.{{cn|date=July 2018}} DFI introduced the junior lineup (“JR”) with two products, p45 and 790gx, in the beginning, which has since been extended with [[Nvidia]] and X58 chipsets. There are other LanParty series like LT, DK(Dark), and Lanparty UT.

DFI launched its initial public offering ([[IPO]]) on January 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2000. As well as developing LanParty consumer products, DFI started to develop ACP (Application Control Platform) businesses, mainly targeted at vertical applications in [[slot machine|slot machines]], [[Point of sale|POS]], security system, and so on since 2002. In 2005, DFI gained over 50% revenues from this new business. With this successful transformation, [[Industrial PC|industrial PCs]] became the primary business of DFI. As of 2003, DFI’s {{cn|date=July 2018}} [[overclocking]] gamer motherboard, LANPARTY NFII ULTRA, was awarded the Chief Editor Choice Award in ''[[PC Magazine]]'' and the Best Creativity Award in ''[[Tom's Hardware]]''. {{cn|date=July 2018}}

Since DFI planned to focus on developing embedded system products, not only did they stop developing consumer products, but also started establishing embedded system developments and designs in 2011 to expand their industrial computer business. Which later became the core value of DFI in the coming years.{{cn|date=July 2018}} After three years of developing industrial computer products, DFI’s EC200-BT fanless [[embedded system]] and EC541-HD Modular-designed system was awarded the Computex d&amp;i Award;{{cn|date=July 2018}} EC541-HD Modular-designed system was awarded the Red Star Design Award;{{cn|date=July 2018}} EC200-BT fanless [[embedded system]] was awarded the Golden Pin Design Award.{{cn|date=July 2018}} As of 2015, DFI was recognized as a certified partner with [[Microsoft Azure]] IoT Platform{{cn|date=July 2018}}, making it easier to provide software and hardware integration services for embedded systems. In order to provide more flexible embedded products and solutions to meet different areas of applications, DFI has joined Qisda/[[BenQ]] Group, who was acclaimed as a 2018 Top 100 Global Technology Leader by Thomson Reuters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/products-services/technology/top-100.html|title=Top 100 Global Tech Leaders|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, at the end of 2017.


==History==

=== 1981-1991 ===
In 1981, Y.C Lu founded DFI Electronics Components Inc. in Taipei, Taiwan; mainly supplying and exporting electronics components with $1 million in capital. During the first year, DFI earned a revenue of $30 million. In 1984, DFI established facility in Taipei and began manufacturing and selling computers and peripherals. When the capital increased up to $10 million, the Sales (Revenue) Growth Rate of DFI also increased to 300% and DFI successfully expanded its operations to the American regions as well as earning nearly $1 billion in revenues. In 1987, with the capital of $30 million, DFI started to establish facility in Hsi-Chih City, Taiwan. At the same time, DFI planned to stretch its product line into  the European markets, starting with Germany and England. As of 1988, the facility relocated to Hsi-Chih City, which was the major facility of DFI. With the expansion of production line and the addition of Automatic Test Equipment (ATE), DFI not only upgraded the quality of products, but also released a world-leading handheld scanner with plans to lead in setting a standard of global specification. As of 1989, DFI added Computer Aided Design System (CAD) to its facility to manufacture more products like computer mouse, handheld scanner, personal computer, and add-on card, etc. In 1990, DFI announced its Patent License Agreement with Intel Corporation and became the first company with an assembly production line in America to enable technical support service in cooperation with Intel. DFI’s capital increased to $196 million and expanded its facility to 1,900 square feet in 1991. 

===1992-2000===
As of 1992, DFI introduced ICT and SMT devices into its facility to increase the manufacturing quality and efficiency. In 1993, DFI continually expanded the facility, which was located in Hsi-Chih City and was 2,300 square feet. DFI’s business office and Research and Development Department moved to the facility and introduced Green PC with energy-efficiency design into the facility. As of 1994, DFI researched and developed CD-ROM, officially entered into multimedia system market. The revenue of the notebook increased to over $100 million and the overall revenue of 1994 increased by 25%, over $2 billion. As of 1996, DFI transformed the CD-ROM facility into an assembly system facility, designing and manufacturing the world’s first 75MHZ system bus motherboard, which supported the CYRIX PR 200+CPU. In the meantime, DFI began establishing the third SMT assembly and adopted Siemens SIPLACE80S-15 high speed CNC machine to increase the production of motherboards to 40,000 pcs per month, as well as increasing the self-production to 120, 000 per month. After successfully manufacturing 586 motherboards that supported dual CPU, DFI was dominant in the motherboard market and targeted developing countries, accommodating to Philips Asian marketing system. As of 1997, DFI expanded the facility in Hsi-Chih City for the third time, totaling the area to 2, 800 square feet. DFI also expanded 2 surface mount technology (SMT) high speed CNC machines to upgrade the production of motherboards to 180, 000 pcs per month. Devoted to developing Philips and Lemel assembly OEM business, DFI manufactured 10, 000 systems every month. At the same time, DFI established a third OEM assembly facility in Dongguan city, China and built a European branch office in Bremen, Germany in order to advance the quality of services in European regions. Being engaged in the server market, DFI got started in designing and developing motherboards that support SCSI onboard and Dual Pentium CPU in 1997. From the year of 1997 to 1999, DFI was awarded the Top 10 Motherboard Manufacturer in CNR (Computer Reseller New) Magazine, which had already gained attention by the worldwide market due to DFI’s motherboards’ design and development. In April, 1998, DFI was preparing to apply for becoming a listed company at Taipei Exchange（TPEx）and TWSE. In the same year, DFI released Intel 440BX series motherboard, which was in line with Intel. The 810 motherboard of DFI was awarded the Demo Board amongst Intel Asia-Pacific region. In February, 1999, P5BV3＋motherboards was awarded the high performance Socket7 motherboard in Computer World Magazine in China. In early May of the same year, DFI launched 810 motherboard to the market, following the release of Intel and had already gone into mass production worldwide. The 810e motherboard was re-awarded Intel Global Demo Board and was launched to the market in September, 1999. DFI went public and launched its initial public offering (IPO) on 15, January, 2000. During the same year, DFI founded Diamond Flower H.T. Group (BVI) Inc.

*Note: DFI no longer makes high-end gamer boards such as the LanParty series for end users. DFI does not support or provide manuals or drivers for the boards listed below. The original DFI LANparty website was shut down in 2010.

DFI caters to the enthusiast market with motherboards with advanced overclocking features and a design with ultraviolet-reactive connectors on a black [[Printed circuit board|PCB]]. There are two versions of the LANParty line with the UT similar to the full LANParty gear except for the omission of the PC Transpo bag, UV sleeving kit, FrontX Panel, and less UV-reactant cables.

DFI introduced their Junior lineup in the mid summer of 2008 with two products, p45 and 790gx, but have somewhat been extended with a nvidia chipset and X58 chipset in late 2008.
The junior lineup "JR" is micro-ATX and they usually support Crossfire or SLI setups with dual-slot videocards.
This series has proven to be a valuable segment in the future for small, powerful computers.{{cn|date=July 2018}} However, they don't contain the same power circuitry ("VRM/PWM") and BIOS options as their full-sized "ATX" counterparts.

There are other LanParty series like LT and DK(Dark).
Lanparty UT is still the most high end line of products and few chipsets are reserved under the name.

The different variants include some of these popular products in the Lanparty series:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8359">The word '''''[[data]]''''' has generated considerable controversy on whether it is an uncountable noun used with verbs conjugated in the singular, or should be treated as the plural of the now-rarely-used ''datum''.

==Usage in English==
In one sense, ''data'' is the [[plural form]] of ''datum''. ''Datum'' actually can also be a [[count noun]] with the plural ''datums'' (see usage in [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] article) that can be used with cardinal numbers (e.g. "80 datums"); ''data'' (originally a Latin plural) is not used like a normal count noun with cardinal numbers and can be plural with such plural determiners as ''these'' and ''many'' or as an [[uncountable noun]] with a verb in the [[Grammatical number|singular]] form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = | title =[[Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage]]| year = 2002 | publisher = Merriam-Webster | location = Springfield, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-87779-132-4| pages = 317–318 | chapter = data, datum}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Even when a very small quantity of data is referenced (one number, for example), the phrase ''piece of data'' is often used, as opposed to ''datum''. The debate over appropriate usage continues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Data is a singular noun |url=http://nxg.me.uk/note/2005/singular-data/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grammarist: Data |url=http://www.grammarist.com/usage/data/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dictionary.com Data |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/data}}&lt;/ref&gt; but "data" as a singular form is far more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/elitist-superfluous-or-popular-we-polled-americans-on-the-oxford-comma/|title=Elitist, Superfluous, Or Popular? We Polled Americans on the Oxford Comma|work=FiveThirtyEight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]], the word ''datum'' is still used in the general sense of "an item given". In [[cartography]], [[geography]], [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] and [[technical drawing]], it is often used to refer to a single specific [[Datum reference|reference datum]] from which distances to all other data are measured. Any measurement or result is a ''datum'', though ''data point'' is now far more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Matt Dye |year=2001 |title=Writing Reports |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/dissert/Writing%20Reports.htm |publisher=[[University of Bristol]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Data'' is most often used as a singular mass noun in everyday usage.&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford Dictionary of English, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...in educated everyday usage as represented by the Guardian newspaper, it is nowadays most often used as a singular." http://www.lexically.net/TimJohns/Kibbitzer/revis006.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Some major newspapers, such as ''[[The New York Times]],'' use it either in the singular or plural. In the ''New York Times'' the phrases "the survey data are still being analyzed" and "the first year for which data is available" &lt;!-- the verb there is singular because the subject is "year", not "data", so that is a bad example of a singular "data".--&gt;have appeared within one day.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |year=2009 |title=When Serving the Lord, Ministers Are Often Found to Neglect Themselves |publisher=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/us/10religion.html }}{{cite news |year=2009 |title=Investment Tax Cuts Help Mostly the Rich |publisher=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/business/10charts.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' explicitly allows this usage in its style guide.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |year=2012 |title=Is Data Is, or Is Data Ain’t, a Plural? |publisher=Wall Street Journal |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2012/07/05/is-data-is-or-is-data-aint-a-plural/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Associated Press]] style guide classifies ''data'' as a collective noun that takes the singular when treated as a unit but the plural when referring to individual items (e.g., "The data is sound" and "The data have been carefully collected").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = The Associated Press | authorlink = Associated Press | editor = Norm Goldstein | title = The Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law |date=June 2002 | publisher = Perseus | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 0-7382-0740-3 | page = 52 | chapter = collective nouns }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[scientific writing]] ''data'' is often treated as a plural, as in ''These data do not support the conclusions'', but the word is also used as a singular mass entity like ''information'', for instance in computing and related disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = |  editor = R.W. Burchfield | title = Fowler's Modern English Usage |edition = 3rd| year = 1996 | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 0-19-869126-2 | pages = 197–198 | chapter = data}}&lt;/ref&gt; British usage now widely accepts treating ''data'' as singular in standard English,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite dictionary |year=1999 |encyclopedia=[[New Oxford Dictionary of English]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; including everyday newspaper usage&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |author=Tim Johns |year=1997 |url=http://www.eisu2.bham.ac.uk/johnstf/revis006.htm |title=Data: singular or plural? |quote=...in educated everyday usage as represented by [[The Guardian]] newspaper, it is nowadays most often used as a singular. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211165815/http://eisu2.bham.ac.uk/johnstf/revis006.htm |archivedate=2009-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at least in non-scientific use.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Dutch Design Week''' (also known as '''DDW''') is an annual event about Dutch design, hosted in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]]. The event takes place around the last week of October and is a nine-day event with exhibitions, workshops, seminars and parties at many venues.

Due to its [[Industrial design|industrial character]], hosting companies like [[Philips]], [[Philips Design]] and [[DAF Trucks|DAF]], Eindhoven sets itself the goal to become the national industry- and design capital. Also, hosting the [[Design Academy Eindhoven]] and the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], the city produces a profound bases for innovation. In order to communicate these outcomes, the Dutch design week is organized.

The initiative started twelve years ago as a [[non-commercial]] fair where [[design]], [[industry]] and [[business]] could talk to each other on 'neutral' ground. Since then, the event grew rapidly each year, more than 250,000 visitors in 2013.

The DDW consists of around 80 venues. The main venues during the event are among others the [[Klokgebouw]] ([[Strijp-S]]), [[Design Academy Eindhoven]] and the [[Faculty of Industrial Design]] at the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], where successful and well-visited expositions were organized, like the "do not disturb exhibition" in 2004.

Whereas the main goal remains to create a non-commercial event, many [[conflicts of interest]] and the rapid growth did contribute to a more commercial approach since 2007.

Pop venue [[Effenaar]] and classical music venue [[Muziekgebouw Frits Philips]] both organize the musical program '''DDW Music''' around the festival with live performances as well as exhibitions related to [[experimental musical instrument]]s, [[sound art]] and [[sound installation]]s.

'''Ellen Henrietta Swallow Richards''' (December 3, 1842 &amp;ndash; March 30, 1911) was an [[Industrial engineering|industrial]] and [[Safety engineering|safety engineer]], [[environmental chemist]], and university faculty member in the United States during the 19th century. Her pioneering work in sanitary engineering, and experimental research in domestic science, laid a foundation for the new science of [[home economics]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2135&amp;ResourceType=Building |title=Richards, Ellen Swallow, Residence |date=April 7, 1991 |accessdate=2013-09-04 |quote= |publisher=[[National Historic Landmarks Program]] |location= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011063112/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2135&amp;ResourceType=Building |archivedate=October 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the founder of the home economics movement characterized by the application of science to the home, and the first to apply chemistry to the study of nutrition.&lt;ref name=mozans&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mozans|first1=H.

[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards 1848.jpg|thumb|upright|Daguerreotype of Ellen Henrietta Swallow, c. 1848]]
Richards was born in [[Dunstable, Massachusetts]]. She was the only child of Peter Swallow (b. June 27, 1813, Dunstable; d. March 1871, Littleton, Massachusetts) and Fanny Gould Taylor (b. April 9, 1817, [[New Ipswich, New Hampshire]]), both of whom came from established families of modest means and were believers in the value of education.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== Early life and education ===
Swallow was home-schooled in her early years. In 1859 the family moved to Westford and she attended [[Westford Academy]].&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = Caroline Louisa | title = The life of Ellen H. Richards | publisher = Whitcomb &amp; Barrows | edition = 1st | location = Boston | year = 1912 | isbn = | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeofellenhrich00huntrich }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies at the academy included mathematics, composition, and Latin, similar to other New England academies of the time.  Swallow's Latin proficiency allowed her to study French and German, a rare language north of New York.&lt;ref name="JuneKennedy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kennedy | first = June W. | title = Westford Recollections of Days Gone By: Recorded Interviews 1974-1975 A Millennium Update | publisher = Author House | edition = 1st | location = Bloomington, IN | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-4259-2388-7 | lccn = 2006904814 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her language skills she was much in demand as a tutor, and the income earned doing this made it possible for Swallow to further her studies.

[[File:Old Westford Academy, MA.jpg|thumb|Old Westford Academy]]

In March 1862, she left the academy. Two months later, in May, she developed the [[measles]] which set her back physically and interrupted her preparations to begin teaching.

[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|upright|Miss Ellen Henrietta Swallow, c. 1864]]
In the spring of 1863 the family moved to Littleton, Massachusetts, where Mr. Swallow had just purchased a larger store and expanded his business. In June 1864, Swallow, now twenty-one, took a teaching position.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

She did not teach again in 1865 but spent that year tending the family store and taking care of her ill mother. During the winter of 1865–66, Swallow studied and attended lectures in Worcester.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== College education ===
In September 1868 she entered [[Vassar College]] classified as a special student.  Somewhat over a year later she was admitted to the senior class, graduating in 1870 with a bachelor's degree.  She then earned a Master of Art's degree with a thesis on the chemical analysis of iron ore. The strongest personal influences during her college years were [[Maria Mitchell]], the astronomer, and Professor Charles S. Farrar (1826-1908&lt;ref name="FarrarVassar"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/faculty/original-faculty/charles-farrar.html |title= Charles Farrar |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= Vassar Encyclopedia|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), who was at the head of the Department of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

In 1870, she wrote to Merrick and Gray, commercial chemists in Boston, asking if they would take her on as an apprentice.  They replied that they were not in a position to take pupils, and that her best course was to try to enter the Institute of Technology of Boston as a student.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;
On December 10, 1870, after some discussion and a vote, the Faculty of the Institute of Technology recommend to the Corporation the admission of Miss Swallow as a special student in Chemistry.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt; Swallow thus became the first woman admitted to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where she was able to continue her studies, "it being understood that her admission did not establish a precedent for the general admission of females" according to the records of the meeting of the [[MIT Corporation]] on December 14, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-mit.html#corp Ellen Swallow Richards &amp; MIT: Institute Archives &amp; Special Collections: MIT]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1873, Swallow received a Bachelor of Science degree from MIT for her thesis, "Notes on Some Sulpharsenites and Sulphantimonites from Colorado".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-swallow.pdf Notes on Some Sulpharsenites and Sulphantimonites from Colorado]&lt;/ref&gt; She continued her studies at MIT and would have been awarded its first advanced degree, but MIT balked at granting this distinction to a woman and did not award its first advanced degree, a Master of Science in Chemistry, until 1886.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Richards served on the board of trustees of Vassar College for many years and was granted an honorary doctor of science degree in 1910.

=== Marriage and home ===
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards 1904.jpg|upright|thumb|Robert and Ellen Richards, 1904]]
On June 4, 1875, Miss Swallow married [[Robert Hallowell Richards|Robert H. Richards]] (1844-1945), chairman of the [[Mine Engineering]] Department at MIT, with whom she had worked in the mineralogy laboratory.  They took up residence in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. With her husband's support she remained associated with MIT, volunteering her services and contributing $1,000 annually to the "Woman's Laboratory," a program in which her students were mostly schoolteachers, whose training had lacked laboratory work, and who wanted to perform chemical experiments and learn mineralogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rossiter|first1=Margaret W.|title=Women Scientists in America|date=1982|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0801824435|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Her first post-college career was as an unpaid chemistry lecturer at MIT from 1873 to 1878.&lt;ref name=zierdt /&gt;

[[File:Lawrence Experiment Station - DSC03522.JPG|thumb|right|2011 addition to the [[Lawrence Experiment Station]]]]
From 1884 until her death, Swallow now Richards was an instructor at the newly founded laboratory of sanitary chemistry at the [[Lawrence Experiment Station]], the first in the United States, headed by her former professor [[William R. Nichols]].

In 1884 she was appointed as an instructor in sanitary chemistry at a newly formed MIT laboratory for the study of sanitation.&lt;ref name=ogilvie&gt;{{Cite book

    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Richards was a consulting chemist for the Massachusetts State Board of Health from 1872 to 1875, and the Commonwealth's official water analyst from 1887 until 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/women-scientists/ellen-h-swallow-richards.html|title=Ellen H.

== Scientific experiments ==

=== Air and water quality ===

In the 1880s, her interests turned toward issues of sanitation, in particular air and water quality.&lt;ref name=zierdt /&gt; She performed a series of water tests on 40,000 samples of local waters which served as drinking water for their immediate populations.  These led to the so-called "Richards' Normal Chlorine Map" which was predictive of inland water pollution in the state of Massachusetts. This map plotted the chloride concentrations in waters of the state. It illustrated the natural distribution of chlorides from the ocean. (Her survey long preceded the practice of road de-icing with chlorine derivative salts.) Her map plotted greater than 6.5 parts per million (ppm) of chloride near the coast, with Cape Cod concentrations well in excess of 10 ppm and with a near-steady decreasing gradient to less than 1 ppm about the Berkshire Hills in the extreme western end of the state. Thereby waters with chloride concentrations that deviated from the plot could be suspected of human pollution. As a result, Massachusetts established the first water-quality standards in America, and the first modern [[sewage treatment plant]] was created.&lt;ref name=oakes /&gt;

=== Mineralogy ===
Richards' master's thesis at Vassar was an analysis of the amount of [[vanadium]] in iron ore.&lt;ref name=oakes&gt;{{Cite book

        }}&lt;/ref&gt;
She performed numerous experiments in mineralogy, including the discovery of an insoluble residue of the rare mineral [[Samarskite-(Y)|samarskite]]. This was later determined by other scientists to yield [[samarium]] and [[gadolinium]]. In 1879 she was recognized by the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers as their first female member.&lt;ref name=zierdt&gt;{{Cite book

        }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home sanitation ===
Richards applied her scientific knowledge to the home. Since women were responsible for the home and family nutrition at the time, Richards felt that all women should be educated in the sciences. She wrote books about science for use in the home, such as ''The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning'', published in 1882.&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;{{Cite book

        }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her book ''Food Materials and Their Adulterations''(1885) led to the passing of the first Pure Food and Drug Act in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=oakes /&gt;

She used her own home as a kind of experimental laboratory for healthier living through science. Concerned with air quality in her home, she moved from coal heating and cooking oil to gas. She and her husband installed fans to pull air from the home to the outside to create a cleaner air environment within the home. She also determined the water quality of the property's well through chemical testing, and to insure that waste water was not contaminating the drinking water.&lt;ref name=clarke /&gt;

=== Euthenics ===

Richards derived the term [[euthenics]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb Eutheneo, Εὐθηνέω (eu, well; the, root of tithemi, to cause). To be in a flourishing state, to abound in, to prosper.—''[[Demosthenes]]''. To be strong or vigorous.—''[[Herodotus]]''. To be vigorous in body.—''[[Aristotle]]''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards"&gt;{{cite book | last = Richards | first = Ellen H. Swallow | title = Euthenics: The Science of Controllable Environment : A Plea for Better Conditions As a First Step Toward Higher Human Efficiency | publisher = Whitcomb &amp; Barrows | edition = 2nd | location = Boston | origyear = 1910 | year = 1912 | isbn = 0405098278 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31508 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  And from the Greek [[Euthenia]], Εὐθηνία. Good state of the body: prosperity, good fortune, abundance.—''Herodotus''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt; The opposite of Euthenia is [[Penia]] - Πενία ("deficiency" or "[[poverty]]") the personification of poverty and need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Penia.html Theoi Project - Penia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''Euthenics: the science of controllable environment'' (1910),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
    |publisher = Whitcomb &amp; Barrows

    |publication-date = 1910
    }}&lt;/ref&gt; she defined the term as the betterment of living conditions, through conscious endeavor, for the purpose of securing efficient human beings.

Vigorous debate about its exact meaning, confusion with the term [[eugenics]], followed by the [[Great Depression]] and two world wars, were among the many factors which led to the movement never really getting the funding, nor the attention needed to put together a lasting, vastly multidisciplinary curriculum as defined by Richards. Instead, different disciplines such as Child Study became one such curriculum.

Martin Heggestad of the Mann Library notes that:&lt;blockquote&gt; Starting around 1920, however, home economists tended to move into other fields, such as nutrition and textiles, that offered more career opportunities, while health issues were dealt with more in the hard sciences and in the professions of nursing and public health. Also, improvements in public sanitation (for example, the wider availability of sewage systems and of food inspection) led to a decline in infectious diseases and thus a decreasing need for the largely household-based measures taught by home economists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/h/hearth/hygiene.html HEARTH Library-Cornell University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Richards was the first writer to use the term euthenics, in ''The Cost of Shelter'' (1905), with the meaning "the science of better living".&lt;ref name="JohnKGrandy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grandy | first = John K. | editor-last = Birx | editor-first = H.J. | title = Euthenics | series = Encyclopedia of Anthropology | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | volume = 5 Vols. | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781412952453 | doi = 10.4135/9781412952453 | url =http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/anthropology/n312.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laboratory work ===
After her first experience as water analyst under Professor Nichols, Richards began a large, private practice in sanitary chemistry, including testing water, air and food, and the testing wallpapers and fabrics for [[arsenic]]. In 1878 and 1879 she examined a large number of staple groceries for the state. The results of her investigation were published in the first annual report of the Board of Health, Lunacy and Charity, which had succeeded the earlier Board of Health.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

She also served as a consultant to the [[Zachariah Allen|Manufacturers Mutual Fire Insurance Company]] and in 1900 wrote the textbook ''Air, Water, and Food from a Sanitary Standpoint'', with A. G. Woodman. Her interest in the environment led her to introduce the word [[ecology]] into English around 1892. The word had been coined by German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] to describe the "household of nature".

Richards' interests also included applying scientific principles to domestic situations, such as [[nutrition]], [[clothing]], [[physical fitness]], [[sanitation]], and efficient home management, creating the field of [[home economics]]. "Perhaps the fact that I am not a radical and that I do not scorn womanly duties but claim it as a privilege to clean up and sort of supervise the room and sew things is winning me stronger allies than anything else," she wrote to her parents. She published ''The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning: A Manual for House-keepers'' in 1881, designed and demonstrated model kitchens, devised curricula, and organized conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-rumford.html Ellen Swallow Richards: Rumford Kitchen: Institute Archives &amp; Special Collections: MIT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's education ==

=== Woman's Laboratory assistant instructor ===
Mrs. Richards appeared before the [[American Association of University Women|Woman's Education Association]] of Boston on November 11, 1875, and in an address, which made a deep impression, set forth the needs of women. She expressed the belief that the governing board of the Institute of Technology would provide space for a woman's laboratory if the Association would supply the necessary money for instruments, apparatus, and books. She said that scholarships would be indispensable.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

The Woman's Education Association appointed a committee to enter into discussions with the Institute of Technology, which led to the creation of the MIT Woman's Laboratory in November 1876. The Institute provided a small building, planned for a gymnasium, as the location of the Laboratory.  Mrs. Richards became an unpaid assistant instructor in 1879 in [[chemical analysis]], [[industrial chemistry]], [[mineralogy]], and [[biology|applied biology]] under Professor John M. Ordway. The Woman's Education Association agreed to raise money to buy equipment for the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

A new building, erected by the Institute in 1883, reserved space for all laboratory students' use, women as well as men. The original Woman's Laboratory was closed and the building demolished.

In 1884, Mrs. Richards was appointed Instructor in Sanitary Chemistry in the Institute of Technology itself, a position which she filled until the time of her death. In addition to her faculty duties and instructional work, she was also the "untitled" Dean of Women.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== American correspondence school instructor ===
In January 1876, Mrs. Richards began a long association with the first American correspondence school, the [[Society to Encourage Studies at Home]], as an instructor, and developed its science department.&lt;ref name="Hunt"/&gt;

In 1886, a new section promoted by Richards, Sanitary Science, was established by the Society. This was at a time when household conveniences employing water, gas, or electricity were becoming more common, but housekeepers seldom understood the dangers or difficulties inherent in using these new appliances. She saw that instruction was needed and the Society began to provide information on how to organize a house on truly scientific principles.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== American Association of University Women ===

[[File:AAUW Headquarters by Matthew Bisanz.JPG|thumb|upright|Headquarters of the AAUW in Washington DC]]
Richards and [[Marion Talbot]] (Boston University class of 1880) became the "founding mothers" of what was to become the [[American Association of University Women]] (AAUW) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://history.aauw.org/|website=AAUW.org|publisher=AAUW|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they invited fifteen other women college graduates to a meeting at Talbot's home in Boston, on November 28, 1881. The group envisioned an organization in which women college graduates would band together to open the doors of higher education to other women and to find wider opportunities for their training. The Association of Collegiate Alumnae (ACA), AAUW's predecessor organization, was officially founded on January 14, 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association of Collegiate Alumnae Records|url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss323.html|publisher=Five College Archives &amp; Manuscript Collections|website=five colleges.edu|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teachers' School of Science ===
[[Lucretia Crocker]], along with women's clubs and other help in the Boston area, created a "[[Teachers' School of Science]]" in Back Bay at the New Museum of the Boston society.  Along with Mrs. Richards, Crocker created a mineralogy course for teachers.  Teacher found such education in the Boston area because of area scientist that would teach their courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kohlstedt, Sally Gregory. |title = Nature, Not Books: Scientists and the Origins of the Nature-Study Movement in the 1890s. Isis, Vol. 96, No. 3 |date = September 2005 |pages=324–352, p. 328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New England Kitchen of Boston ===
In January 1, 1890, Richards collaborated with [[Mary Abel|Mary Hinman Abel]] (1850–1938) to found the New England Kitchen of Boston, at 142 Pleasant Street.  Using volunteers of modest circumstances, they experimented with ways to prepare the most inexpensive, tasty and nutritious food.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Years later, Mrs. Richards, herself, wrote in her preface to part one of ''The Rumford kitchen leaflets: No. 17, The Story of the New England Kitchen; Part II; A study in social economics'', by Mary Abel:&lt;ref name="RumfordKitchen" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The story of the New England Kitchen ... is remarkable for two things: the new and valuable information which has been acquired, as the result of the daily work of the Kitchen, and the short time which has sufficed to put the enterprise on a business basis.

It is well to emphasize the causes of this success, that the lessons in social science and practical philanthropy be not lost. A large part of the credit is due ... to Mrs. Abel's hard work[.] [S]tarting the New England Kitchen ... was ... an experiment to determine the successful conditions of preparing, by scientific methods, from the cheaper food materials, nutritious and palatable dishes, which should find a ready demand at paying prices.

Mrs. Abel would doubtless give as the principal secret of her success, that she had everything necessary for the experiments, without giving a thought to the cost. ... In the New England Kitchen, the selection of the apparatus and material and the employment of labor have been without restriction. Without this freedom to carry on the experiments as seemed wise and prudent, the results detailed in the accompanying report could not have been attained.

The philanthropy of the scheme rests in the experimental stage of the development of the New England Kitchen. Whether the business can in the future take care of itself to the profit of those who conduct it remains to be seen ; but, in any event, kitchens of this kind cannot fail to be of great advantage to multitudes in moderate circumstances, who have hitherto been unable to buy good, nutritious, and tasteful cooked food.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Rumford Kitchen ===
[[File:CountRumfordFrontispiece.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Count Rumford]] frontispiece of the Rumford Kitchen leaflets]]
In 1893, when Richards was in charge of the Rumford Kitchen at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|World's Fair in Chicago]], she accepted the added work and responsibility of arranging an exhibition of the work of Studies at Home.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

The opening statement of the ''Guide to the Rumford Kitchen: An Exhibit made by the State of Massachusetts in connection with the Bureau of Hygiene and Sanitation'' ([[World's Columbian Exposition]], Chicago, 1893) by General [[Francis Amasa Walker|Francis A. Walker]] explains:&lt;ref name="RumfordKitchen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Richards | first = Ellen H.  | title = Plain words about food: the Rumford kitchen leaflets, 1899. | publisher = Rockwell and Churchill Press | edition = 1st | location = Boston | year = 1899 | isbn = | lccn = | url = http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/2936825?n=1&amp;imagesize=1200&amp;jp2Res=.5&amp;printThumbnails=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The exhibit known as the Rumford Kitchen is the outgrowth of the work, in the application of the principles of chemistry to the science of cooking, which has for three years been carried on as an educational agency by Mrs. Robert H. Richards and Mrs. Dr. John J. Abel, with pecuniary assistance from certain public-spirited citizens of Boston.

The Massachusetts Board of World's Fair Managers, ... believing that such practical demonstration of the usefulness of domestic science could not fail to be of advantage to multitudes of visitors to the Columbian Exposition, have invited the ladies named to open the Rumford Kitchen as a part of the exhibit of Massachusetts in connection with the Bureau of Hygiene and Sanitation.

In order to reduce, in some degree, the expenses of this exhibit, the food cooked in the Rumford Kitchen will be sold under a concession from the administration of the Exposition ; but it should be understood that this is not a money-making exhibit ; that nothing is cooked for the sake of being sold ; and that the enterprise is to be regarded as absolutely a scientific and educational one.

The purpose of the exhibit in the Rumford Kitchen is two-fold : First, to commemorate the services to the cause of domestic science rendered by [[Count Rumford]] one hundred years ago[;] ... second, to serve as an incentive to further work in the same direction, as he expressed it," to provoke men to investigation," "to cause doubt, that first step toward knowledge."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first commercially available "modern" [[Rumford fireplace|kitchen ranges]] began to appear about 1800, they were the invention of an American named Sir Benjamin Thompson, [[Benjamin Thompson|Count von Rumford]].

=== American Public School Lunch Program ===
A first, major program was started in some Boston high schools in 1894 to provide nutritional meals at low prices to children who would not normally have them. Due in large part to Ellen Richards and [[Edward Atkinson (activist)|Edward Atkinson]], the New England Kitchen ran the program as a 'private enterprise' that paid for itself many times over. The lunches never became effective instruments for teaching the New Nutrition the founders had envisaged. But, because the program provided nutritious meals children would otherwise not have, it became the main justification for similar lunch programs in other cities."&lt;ref name="Levenstein"&gt;{{cite book | last = Levenstein | first = Harvey | title = Revolution at the Table: The Transformation of the American Diet | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | edition = | location = New York | year = 1988 | page = 116 | isbn =  | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed into law the [[National School Lunch Program]] to provide low-cost or free [[School meal|school lunch meals]] to qualified students through subsidies to schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/1946-national-school-lunch-act/ Copy of the School Lunch Act As Enacted in 1946], Federal Education Policy History website&lt;/ref&gt; The program was established as a way to prop up food prices by absorbing farm surpluses, while at the same time providing food to school age children. It was named after Richard Russell, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/Lunch/AboutLunch/ProgramHistory_4.htm The National School Lunch Program Background and Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lake Placid Conference ===
Early in September, 1899, trustees of the [[Lake Placid Club]] (Morningside, New York) thought it was the right time to bring together those most interested in home science, or household economics and sent out many invitations for the Lake Placid Conference scheduled to take place Sept. 19-25, 1899. [[Melvil Dewey]], one of the club's trustees, personally invited Richards to attend.  She gave a lecture on standards of living and was elected chairman of the conference.&lt;ref name="LakePlacidConference"&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Richards | editor-first = Ellen H. | title = Lake Placid Conference proceedings | series = Lake Placid Conference | year = 1901–1908 | pages =  | place = Lake Placid, NY | publisher = American Home Economics Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Home Economics Association ===
In 1908, Richards was chosen as the first president of the newly formed American Home Economics Association, which was renamed the [[American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences]] in 1994. She also founded and funded the Association's periodical, the ''Journal of Home Economics'', which began publication in 1909. It was renamed the ''Journal of Family and Consumer Sciences'' in 1994 when the Association changed its name.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Her books and writings on this topic include ''Food Materials and their Adulterations'' (1886); ''Conservation by Sanitation''; ''The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning''; ''The Cost of Living'' (1899); ''Air, Water, and Food'' (1900); ''The Cost of Food''; ''The Cost of Shelter''; ''The Art of Right Living''; ''The Cost of Cleanness''; ''Sanitation in Daily Life'' (1907); and ''[[Euthenics]], the Science of Controllable Environment'' (1910). Some of these went through several editions.

== Death ==
Richards died on March 30, 1911 at her home in [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts]] after suffering with [[angina]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Mrs. Ellen H.

'''Energy Logic''' is a vendor-neutral approach to achieving energy efficiency in [[data centers]]. Developed and initially released in 2007,  the Energy Logic efficiency model suggests ten holistic actions – encompassing IT equipment as well as traditional data center infrastructure – guided by the principles dictated by the "Cascade Effect."

==Energy Logic Assumptions==

The first iteration of the Energy Logic model was introduced by [[Emerson Network Power]] on November 29, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;“Emerson Network Power Introduces New Approach to Data Center Energy Optimization,” Press Release from Corporate Web Site [http://www.emerson.com/en-US/newsroom/news-releases/emerson-business-news/Pages/Emerson-New-Approach-Data-Center-Energy-Optimization.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Described as a “new approach to energy optimization,” the model was developed in response to industry feedback suggesting a growing emphasis on promoting efficiency initiatives, without compromising the performance and reliability of the data center.&lt;ref&gt;"Emerson Delivers Free Energy Logic Blueprint for Building a Power Efficient Data Center”, "InfoWorld" [http://www.infoworld.com/d/green-it/emerson-delivers-free-energy-logic-blueprint-building-power-efficient-datacenter-731]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Energy Logic [[data center efficiency]] model was developed based on research and modeling of a 5,000 square foot data center, including average IT equipment densities, common data center and facility infrastructures (power, cooling, etc.) and their collective energy draw.

Energy draw for the 5,000 square foot data center model was based on the following assumptions:&lt;ref&gt;“Energy Logic: Reducing Data Center Energy Consumption by Creating Savings that Cascade Across Systems,” White Paper [http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/Latest-Thinking/EDC/Documents/White%20Paper/EnergyLogicReducingDataCenterEnergyConsumption.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Server (computing)|Server]] refresh rate: 4 to 5 years
** Data center has mix of servers ranging from new to 4-years old
* No virtualization or blades
* No high-density loads
** Average density: 3&amp;nbsp;kW/rack (120 W/sq. ft.)
* Total compute load: about 600&amp;nbsp;kW
* UPS configuration: 2x750 kVA, 1+1 redundant
* Hot-aisle/cold-aisle configuration
* Floor-mount cooling connected to building chilled water plant
* MV transformer (5 MVA) at building entrance with switchgear

==The Cascade Effect==

Based on the benchmarks established by the 5,000 sq. ft. model, Emerson Network Power recommended improvements to IT and data center infrastructures capable of maximizing total energy savings by leveraging the “[[cascade effect]].”
For the purposes of the Energy Logic model, the cascade effect assumes that for every one watt of energy saved at the server component level, a data center can expect to realize up to 2.84 Watts in cumulative energy savings as the initial reduction “cascades” through the infrastructure (DC-DC, AC/DC, [[Power Distribution]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2008/02/22/emerson-analysis-ids-cascading-energy-gains/ “Emerson Analysis IDs Cascading Energy Gains,” Data Center Knowledge]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy Logic Actions ==

The Energy Logic model proposes ten vendor-neutral actions that are forecast to reduce cumulative energy consumption by up to 50 percent (reducing energy consumption to 585&amp;nbsp;kW from the data center's initial 1,127&amp;nbsp;kW load).&lt;ref&gt;[http://7x24exchangerm.org/EnergyLogic%20Presentation.pdf “Energy Logic Presentation,” via the 7x24 Exchange]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ten recommended actions prescribed in the Energy Logic model are:

# Integrating [[IT equipment]] with low-power [[processors]] (yields a 10 percent savings)
# Deploying high efficiency [[power supplies]] matched to power needs (yields a 12 percent savings)
# Implementing a [[server power management]] system/strategy (yields an 11 percent savings)
# Deploying [[blade servers]] (yields a 1 percent savings)
# Implementing server [[virtualization]] throughout the IT infrastructure (yields a 14 percent savings)
# Establishing an efficient power distribution architecture (yields a 3 percent savings)
# Implementing data center cooling best practices (Optimizing Airflow, Using Optimal Set Points, Reducing Energy Waste, Etc.) (yields a 2 percent savings)
# Deploying variable capacity cooing equipment (including chilled-water and direct-expansion systems) (yields a 7 percent savings)
# Deploying high-density supplemental cooling (yields an 18 percent savings)
# Implementing a data center monitoring and optimization strategy (yields a 2 percent savings)

The Energy Logic model also suggests additional opportunities for energy savings, including:
*
* Identifying and disconnecting unused servers
* Consolidating [[Computer data storage|data storage]]
* Implementing [[economizers]] for subsidized cooling
* Monitoring and reducing energy losses tied to facility infrastructure ([[Electric generator|generator]]s, lighting, perimeter access, etc.)

==Energy Logic 2.0 ==

In 2012, Emerson Network Power introduced an update to the Energy Logic model, to take into consideration advances in IT and data center infrastructure technology.

Using the same 5,000 square foot data center benchmarked in the 2007 model, Energy Logic 2.0 updates the ten prescribed actions to reflect current technologies and average equipment efficiency. As a result, the updated actions are forecast to yield energy savings up to 74 percent (reducing energy consumption from 1,543&amp;nbsp;kW to 408&amp;nbsp;kW in the model data center).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2012/08/28/emerson-updates-energy-logic-roadmap/ “Emerson Updates Energy Logic Roadmap,”  via Data Center Knowledge]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ten updated actions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/Latest-Thinking/EDC/EnergyLogic/Pages/EnergyLogicActions.aspx “Energy Logic 2.0 Actions,” via EfficientDataCenters.com]&lt;/ref&gt; include:

# Deploying low-power components (yields a. 11.2 percent energy savings) 
# Deploying high-efficiency power supplies matched to power needs (yields a 7.1 percent energy savings) 
# Implementing a server power management system/strategy (yields a 9.4 percent energy savings) 
# Establishing an [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] architecture (yields a 3.5 percent energy savings) 
# Implementing a server virtualization and consolidation strategy (yields a 29 percent energy savings) 
# Optimizing the data center’s power architecture (yields a 4.1 percent energy savings) 
# Implementing a temperature and airflow management strategy (yields a 5.2 percent energy savings) 
# Deploying variable-capacity cooing equipment (including chilled-water and direct-expansion systems) (yields a 2.6 percent energy savings) 
# Establishing a high-density cooling infrastructure (yields a 1.5 percent energy savings) 
# Implementing a comprehensive [[Data Center Infrastructure Management]] (DCIM) strategy

'''Felice Matteucci''' (February 12, 1808 &amp;ndash; September 13, 1887) was an Italian [[hydraulic]] engineer who co-invented an [[internal combustion engine]] with [[Eugenio Barsanti]]. Their patent request was granted in London on June 12, 1854, and published in London's Morning Journal under the title "Specification of Eugene Barsanti and Felix Matteucci, Obtaining Motive Power by the Explosion of Gases", as documented by the Fondazione Barsanti e Matteucci.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7ijYDkmZxI|title=il motore a scoppio Barsanti e Matteucci - la storia (part2)|first=|last=mirko ferrari|date=18 January 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La documentazione essenziale per l'attribuzione della scoperta|url=http://www.barsantiematteucci.it/inglese/documentiStorici.html|quote= A later request was presented to the Patent Office of the Reign of Piedmont, under No. 700 of Volume VII of that Office. The text of this patent request is not available, only a photo of the table containing a drawing of the engine. This may have been either a new patent or an extension of a patent granted three days earlier, on 30 December 1857, at Turin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Lucca]], Tuscany, Matteucci studied hydraulic and mechanical engineering, first in Paris, then in [[Florence]]. In 1851 he met Father Barsanti and appreciated his ideas for a new type of engine. They worked together to turn the primary concept into a manufacturable item, eventually developing a model suitable for mass production. Its construction was entrusted to Bauer &amp; Co. of Milan, a company also known as Helvetica, which delivered the motor at the beginning of 1863.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

The success of the engine, which was much more efficient that the steam-engine, was so great that orders started pouring in from as far away as Constantinople.{{cn|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--then why did the business fail...?--&gt; Matteucci and Barsanti reached an agreement for the production of the motor with a company in [[Belgium]], and Barsanti departed for [[Belgium]] on February 18, 1864 to oversee the work personally. On the following April 19, Barsanti died suddenly, and all their work came to an end.

Matteucci returned to his previous work as a hydraulic engineer. He studied new [[hydrometer]]s (to measure the level of a river), [[rain gauge]]s, and hydraulic operations over rivers.

In 1877, Matteucci defended that he and Barsanti were the originators of the invention of the [[internal combustion engine]]. The patent registered by [[Nikolaus August Otto]] was indeed very similar to the [[Barsanti-Matteucci engine]]. This frustration contributed to Matteucci's illness that eventually caused his death, in his own home in [[Capannori]], near [[Lucca]]. The documents concerning the priority of Barsanti and Matteucci’s engine and their patents in England, Piedmont, France, Belgium and Prussia are kept in the archive of the library of the Museo Galileo in Florence. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://biblioteca.imss.fi.it/856/archivio_motore_barsanti_matteucci.pdf|title = Summary of the documents concerning Barsanti and Matteucci’s new motor patent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Su-27UB cockpit.jpg|thumb|300px|An IRST sensor on the Su-27.]]

An '''infrared search and track''' ('''IRST''') system (sometimes known as '''infrared sighting and tracking''') is a method for detecting and tracking objects which give off [[infrared]] [[radiation]] (see [[Infrared signature]]) such as [[jet aircraft]] and [[helicopter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mahulikar, S.P., Sonawane, H.R., &amp; Rao, G.A.: (2007) "Infrared signature studies of aerospace vehicles", ''Progress in Aerospace Sciences'',  v. '''43(7-8)''', pp. 218-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

IRST is a generalized case of [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR), i.e. from forward-looking to all-round [[situation awareness]]. Such systems are passive ([[thermographic camera]]), meaning they do not give out any radiation of their own, unlike [[radar]]. This gives them the advantage that they are difficult to detect.

However, because the atmosphere attenuates infrared to some extent (although not as much as [[visible light]]) and because adverse weather can attenuate it also (again, not as badly as visible systems), the range compared to a radar is limited. Within range, [[angular resolution]] is better than radar due to the shorter [[wavelength]].

== Early systems ==

[[File:F-8E VMFAW-235 DaNang Apr1966.jpg|thumb|An F-8E of [[VMFA-235|VMF(AW)-235]] at [[Da Nang Air Base|Da Nang]], in April 1966 showing the IRST in front of the canopy.]]
The first use of an IRST system appears to be the [[F-101 Voodoo]], [[F-102 Delta Dagger]] and [[F-106 Delta Dart]]  [[interceptors]]. The F-106 had an early IRST mounting replaced in 1963 with a production retractable mount.&lt;ref name="Kinzeyp12"&gt;Kinzey 1983, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The IRST was also incorporated into the [[Vought F-8 Crusader]] (F-8E variant) which allowed passive tracking of heat emissions and was similar to the later [[Texas Instruments]] AAA-4 installed on early [[F-4 Phantoms]].&lt;ref name="Sweetmanp552"&gt;Sweetman 1987, p. 552.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Phantom menace. March CA (8203458393).jpg|thumb|AN/AAA-4 IRST under nose of F-4 Phantom]]

The F-4 Phantom had a Texas Instruments AAA-4 infrared seeker&lt;ref name="Sweetmanp526"&gt;Sweetman 1987, p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt; under the nose of early production aircraft F-4B's and F-4C's and not installed on later F-4-D's due to limited capabilities,&lt;ref name="Sweetmanp532"&gt;Sweetman 1987, p. 532.&lt;/ref&gt; but retained the bulge and indeed some F-4D's had the IRST receiver retrofitted in a modified form.&lt;ref name="Sweetmanp552"&gt;Sweetman 1987, p. 552.&lt;/ref&gt;

The F-4E eliminated the AAA-4 IRST bulge and received an internal gun mount which took up the area under the nose.&lt;ref name="Sweetmanp537"&gt;Sweetman 1987, p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt; The F-4J which had a [[pulse-doppler]] radar also eliminated the AAA-4 IRST receiver and bulge under the nose.&lt;ref name="Edenp279"&gt;Eden 2004, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of IRST in an Eastern European country was the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.defencetalk.com/mig-23-flogger-16805/&lt;/ref&gt; The MiG-23 used the (TP-23ML) IRIST and later versions used the (26SH1) IRST. The [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25]]PD was also equipped with a small IRIST under the nose.&lt;ref&gt;Peter G. Dancey(2015)Soviet Aircraft Industry,Fonthill Media&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish [[Saab 35 Draken#Variants|Saab J-35F2 Draken]] (1965) also used an IRST, a [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] N71.

=== Technology ===
These were fairly simple systems consisting of an [[IR sensor|infra-red sensor]] with a horizontally rotating shutter in front of it. The shutter was slaved to a display under the main interception radar display in the cockpit. Any IR light falling on the sensor would generate a "pip" on the display, in a fashion similar to the [[B-scope]]s used on early radars.

The display was primarily intended to allow the radar operator to manually turn the radar to the approximate angle of the target, in an era when radar systems had to be "locked on" by hand. The system was considered to be of limited utility, and with the introduction of more automated radars they disappeared from fighter designs for some time.

== Later systems ==
IRST systems re-appeared on more modern designs starting in the 1980s with the introduction of 2-D sensors, which cued both horizontal and vertical angle. Sensitivities were also greatly improved, leading to better resolution and range. In more recent years, new systems have entered the market. In 2015, Northrop Grumman introduced its OpenPod(TM) IRST pod,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/openpod/Pages/default.aspx|title=OpenPod™ IRST and OpenPod™ Targeting|website=Northrop Grumman|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which uses a sensor by [[Leonardo S.p.A.|Leonardo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drew|first=Carey|title=‘Northrop unveils OpenPod as USAF seeks F-15 IRST|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/northrop-unveils-openpod-as-usaf-seeks-f-15-irst-413022/|publisher=Flight Global|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These fighter aircraft carry the IRST systems for use instead of radar when the situation warrants it, such as when shadowing other aircraft, under the control of [[Airborne Early Warning and Control]](AWACS) aircraft, or executing a [[Ground-controlled interception]](GCI), where an external radar is used to help vector the fighter to a target and the IRST is used to pick up and track the target once the fighter is in range.

[[File:German MIG-29 Nose.jpg|thumb|left|MiG-29 nose showing radome and S-31E2 KOLS IRST]]

With [[infrared homing]] or [[fire-and-forget]] missiles, the fighter may be able to fire upon the target without having to turn its radar sets on at all. Otherwise, the fighter can turn the radar on and achieve a lock immediately before firing if desired. The fighter could also close to within [[autocannon|cannon]] range and engage that way.

Whether or not they use their radar, the IRST system can still allow them to launch a surprise attack.

An IRST system may also have a regular magnified optical sight slaved to it, to help the IRST-equipped aircraft identify the target at long range. As opposed to an ordinary [[FLIR|forward looking infrared]] system, an IRST system will actually scan the space around the aircraft similarly to the way in which mechanically (or even electronically) steered radars work. The exception to the scanning technique is the F-35 JSF's DAS, which stares in all directions simultaneously, and automatically detects and declares aircraft and missiles in all directions, without a limit to the number of targets simultaneously tracked.

When they find one or more potential targets they will alert the pilot(s) and display the location of each target relative to the aircraft on a screen, much like a radar. Again similarly to the way a radar works, the operator can tell the IRST to track a particular target of interest, once it has been identified, or scan in a particular direction if a target is believed to be there (for example, because of an advisory from AWACS or another aircraft).

IRST systems can incorporate [[laser rangefinder]]s in order to provide full [[fire-control system|fire-control]] solutions for cannon fire or launching missiles ([[Optronique secteur frontal]]). The combination of an atmospheric propagation model, the apparent surface of the target, and target motion analysis (TMA) IRST can calculate the range.

The United States Air Force is currently seeking an IRST system for its F-15 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-taps-boeing-to-select-new-f-15-sensor-supplier-430208/|title=USAF taps Boeing to select new F-15 sensor supplier|date=2016-10-10|newspaper=Flightglobal.com|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance ==

Detection range varies with
* clouds
* altitude
* air temperature
* target's attitude
* target's speed

The higher the altitude, the less dense the atmosphere and the less infrared radiation it absorbs - especially at longer wavelengths. The effect of reduction in friction between air and aircraft does not compensate the better transmission of infrared radiation. Therefore, infrared detection ranges are longer at high altitudes.

At high altitudes, temperatures range from −30 to −50&amp;nbsp;°C - which provide better contrast between aircraft temperature and background temperature.

The Eurofighter Typhoon's PIRATE IRST can detect subsonic fighters from 50&amp;nbsp;km from front and 90&amp;nbsp;km from rear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmlv.gv.at/truppendienst/ausgaben/artikel.php?id=807
|accessdate=2014-02-05
|title=Der Eurofighter "Typhoon" (VII) - Radar und Selbstschutz
|publisher=Österreicher Bundesheer
|date=June 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the larger value being the consequence of directly observing the engine exhaust, with an even greater increase being possible if the target uses [[afterburners]].

The range at which a target can be sufficiently confidently identified to decide on weapon release is significantly inferior to the detection range - manufacturers have claimed it is about 65% of detection range.

The '''[[intermodulation]] intercept point''' is a measure of an electrical device's [[linearity]]. When driven by two [[sinusoidal wave]]forms, it is the theoretical power level at which the power of the desired tone and the nth-order (where n is odd) intermodulation product intersect.

'''Isogrid''' is a type of partially hollowed-out structure formed usually from a single metal plate (or face sheet) with triangular integral stiffening ribs (often called stringers). It is extremely light and stiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1393&amp;context=gradschool_diss|title=NEW ULTRA-LIGHTWEIGHT STIFF PANELS FOR SPACE APERTURES|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other materials, it is expensive to manufacture, and so it is restricted to spaceflight applications and some particularly critical parts of more general aerospace use.

Isogrid structures are related to [[sandwich-structured composite]] panels; both can be modeled using [[sandwich theory]], which describes structures with separated, stiff face sheets and a lighter interconnecting layer.  Isogrids are manufactured from single sheets of material and with large-scale triangular openings, and an open pattern to the [[flange]]s, compared to closed sheets and foam or honeycomb structures for the sandwich-composite structures.

Isogrid structures are constituted by a thin skin reinforced with a lattice structure. Such structures are adopted in the aeronautical industry since they present both structural resistance and lightness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-05-20|title=Design and manufacturing of an isogrid structure in composite material: Numerical and experimental results|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263822316300800|journal=Composite Structures|language=en|volume=143|pages=189–201|doi=10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.02.043|issn=0263-8223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The triangular pattern is very efficient because it retains rigidity while saving material and therefore weight. The term isogrid is used because the structure acts like an [[isotropic]] material, with equal properties measured in any direction, and grid, referring to the sheet and stiffeners structure.

A similar variant is the [[Orthogrid]] which uses [[rectangular tiling|rectangular]] rather than triangular openings.  This is not isotropic (has different properties from different angles) but matches many [[use case]]s well and is easier to manufacture.

Traditionally, the [[triangular tiling|equilateral triangle pattern]] was used because it was amenable to simplified analysis.&lt;ref name="isodesign_handbook"&gt;{{cite book

== Manufacturing ==
The stiffeners of an isogrid are generally machined from one face of a single sheet of material such as aluminum with a CNC milling machine. A thickness less than 0.040 in. (1.0 [[millimeter]]) might require [[chemical milling]] processes.&lt;ref name="theisogrid"&gt;{{cite web

Composite isogrids are rib-skin configurations, where at least a part of the rib is a different material from the skin, the composite assembled by various manual or automated processes.&lt;ref name="gridstiffened_manufacturing"&gt;{{cite journal

== Uses ==
[[File:CST-100 pressure vessel.jpg|thumb|Isogrids on the [[CST-100]] pressure vessel]]
Isogrid panels form self-stiffened structures where low weight, stiffness, strength and damage tolerance are important, such as in aircraft or space vehicles. 
Aerospace isogrid structures include payload shrouds and boosters, which must support the full weight of upper stages and payloads under high G loads.  Their open configuration with a single, sealed sheet facing the outside makes them especially useful for propellant tanks for rockets, where sealing the propellant in, but allowing it to drain in use or maintenance are necessary features.

Some spacecraft and launch vehicles which use isogrid structures include:

'''Line level''' is the specified [[Audio power|strength]] of an audio signal used to transmit [[analog (signal)|analog]] sound between audio components such as [[compact disc|CD]] and [[Digital Versatile Disc|DVD]] players, [[television set]]s, [[audio amplifier]]s, and [[mixing console]]s.

Line level sits amongst other signal strengths such as those from weaker audio signals i.e. [[microphone]]s and [[Pick up (music technology)|instrument pickups]], and stronger signals, such as those used to drive [[headphones]] and [[loudspeaker]]s. The "strength" of these various signals does not necessarily refer to the output voltage of the source device; it also depends on its [[output impedance]] and output power capability.

Consumer electronic devices concerned with audio (for example [[Sound card#General characteristics|sound card]]s) often have a connector labeled ''line in'' and/or ''line out''. ''Line out'' provides an audio signal output and ''line in'' receives a signal input. The line in/out connections on consumer-oriented audio equipment are typically [[Unbalanced line|unbalanced]], with a {{nowrap|3.5 mm}} (0.14&amp;nbsp;inch, but commonly called "eighth inch") [[phone connector (audio)|3-conductor TRS minijack connector]] providing ground, left channel, and right channel, or stereo [[RCA connector|RCA jacks]]. Professional equipment commonly uses [[balanced line|balanced connections]] on {{nowrap|6.35 mm}} (1/4&amp;nbsp;inch) TRS [[phone connector (audio)|phone jacks]] or [[XLR connector]]s. Professional equipment may also use unbalanced connections with (1/4&amp;nbsp;inch) TS phone jacks.

== Nominal levels ==
[[File:Line levels.svg|thumb|center|500px|Voltage vs. time of sine waves at reference and line levels, with V&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;PK&lt;/sub&gt;, and V&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt; marked for the +4dBu line level.]]

A line level describes a line's [[nominal level|nominal signal level]] as a ratio, expressed in [[decibel]]s, against a standard reference voltage.  The nominal level and the reference voltage against which it is expressed depend on the line level being used.  While the nominal levels themselves vary, only two reference voltages are common: {{nowrap|[[Decibel#Voltage|decibel volts]] (dBV)}} for consumer applications, and {{nowrap|[[decibel#Voltage|decibels unloaded]] (dBu)}} for professional applications.

The decibel volt reference voltage is {{nowrap|1 V&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{nowrap|0 dBV}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tangible-technology.com/audiobasics/levels/level.html#SIDEBAR__calculating_dB_and_Power Tangible Tech Audio Basics]&lt;/ref&gt;  The decibel unloaded reference voltage, {{nowrap|0 dBu}}, is the AC voltage required to produce {{nowrap|1 mW}} of power across a {{nowrap|600 Ω}} impedance (approximately {{nowrap|0.7746 V&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;}}).&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook for Sound Engineers: The New Audio Cyclopedia, Second Edition|editor=Glenn M. Ballou|year=1998|publisher=Focal Press|isbn=0-240-80331-0|pages=761}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This awkward unit is a holdover from the early telephone standards, which used 600&amp;nbsp;Ω sources and loads, and measured dissipated power in decibel-milliwatts ([[dBm]]).  Modern audio equipment does not use 600&amp;nbsp;Ω matched loads, hence ''dBm unloaded'' (''dBu'').

The most common nominal level for professional equipment is {{nowrap|+4 dBu}} (by convention, decibel values are written with an explicit sign symbol). For consumer equipment it is {{nowrap|−10 dBV}}, which is used to reduce manufacturing costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIfOAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22%E2%88%9210+dBV%22+%221+kHz%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE8q7lr9ndAhWlMX0KHfl-CcwQ6AEIODAC#v=onepage&amp;q=pickup&amp;f=false|title=The Audio Expert: Everything You Need to Know About Audio|last=Winer|first=Ethan|publisher=Focal Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-240-82100-9|location=|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressed in absolute terms, a signal at {{nowrap|−10 dBV}} is equivalent to a [[sine wave]] signal with a peak amplitude (V&lt;sub&gt;PK&lt;/sub&gt;) of approximately {{nowrap|0.447 volts}}, or any general signal at {{nowrap|0.316 volts}} [[root mean square]] (V&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;).  A signal at {{nowrap|+4 dBu}} is equivalent to a sine wave signal with a peak amplitude of approximately {{nowrap|1.736 volts}}, or any general signal at approximately 1.228&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;.

Peak-to-peak (sometimes abbreviated as ''p-p'') amplitude (V&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt;) refers to the total voltage swing of a signal, which is double the peak amplitude of the signal. For instance, a signal with a peak amplitude of {{nowrap|±0.5 V}} has a {{nowrap|p-p amplitude}} of {{nowrap|1.0 V}}.

The line level signal is an [[alternating current]] signal without a DC offset, meaning that its voltage varies with respect to signal ground from the peak amplitude (for example {{nowrap|+1.5 V}}) to the equivalent negative voltage ({{nowrap|−1.5 V}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitat.tuu.fi/?p=45 Oscilloscoped measurement for line level signal]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impedances ==

As cables between line output and line input are generally extremely short compared to the audio signal wavelength in the cable, 
[[transmission line]] effects can be disregarded and [[impedance matching]] need not be used. 
Instead, line level circuits use the [[impedance bridging]] principle, 
in which a low impedance output drives a high impedance input. 
A typical line out connection has an output impedance from 100 to 600 Ω, with lower values being more common in newer equipment. 
Line inputs present a much higher impedance, typically {{nowrap|10 kΩ}} or more.&lt;ref name="rane126"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two impedances form a [[voltage divider]] with a shunt element that is large relative to the size of the series element, which ensures that little of the signal is shunted to ground and that current requirements are minimized. 
Most of the voltage asserted by the output appears across the input impedance and almost none of the voltage is dropped across the output.&lt;ref name="rane126"/&gt;
The line input acts similarly to a high impedance voltmeter or oscilloscope input, measuring the voltage asserted by the output while drawing minimal current (and hence minimal power) from the source. 
The high impedance of the line in circuit does not [[Electrical load|load down]] the output of the source device.

These are voltage signals (as opposed to current signals) and it is the signal information (voltage) that is desired, not power to drive a [[transducer]], such as a speaker or antenna. The actual information that is exchanged between the devices is the variance in voltage; it is this alternating voltage signal that conveys the information, making the current irrelevant.

== Line out ==
[[File:Line out symbol.svg|28px]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[File:Line waves03-0-out.png|42px]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[File:Line waves03-1-out.png|32px]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[File:Line circle out.png|35px]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Line-out symbol. [[PC System Design Guide#Color-coding scheme for connectors and ports|PC Guide color]] {{color box|palegreen}} lime green.

Line outputs usually present a source impedance of from 100 to 600 [[ohm]]s. The voltage can reach 2 volts [[Amplitude#Peak-to-peak amplitude|peak-to-peak]] with levels referenced to −10 [[Decibel#Voltage|dBV]] (300 mV) at {{nowrap|10 kΩ}}. The [[frequency response]] of most modern equipment is advertised as at least 20&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz, which corresponds to the [[Hearing range|range of human hearing]]. Line outputs are intended to drive a load impedance of 
10,000 ohms; with only a few volts, this requires only minimal current.

=== Connecting other devices ===

Connecting a low-impedance load such as a loudspeaker (usually {{nowrap|4 to 8 Ω}}) to a line out will essentially  [[short circuit]] the output circuit. Such loads are around 1/1000 the impedance a line out is designed to drive, so the line out is usually not designed to source the current that would be drawn by a 4 to 8 ohm load at normal line out signal voltages. The result will be very weak sound from the speaker and possibly a damaged line out circuit.

Headphone outputs and line outputs are sometimes confused. 
Different make and model headphones have widely varying impedances, from as little as {{nowrap|20 Ω}} to a few hundred ohms; the lowest of these will have results similar to a speaker, while the highest may work acceptably if the line out impedance is low enough and the headphones are sensitive enough.

Conversely, a headphone output generally has a source impedance of only a few ohms (to provide a bridging connection with 32 ohm headphones) and will easily drive a line input.

For similar reasons, "wye"-cables (or "Y-splitters") should not be used to combine two line out signals into a single line in. 
Each line output would be driving the other line output as well as the intended input, 
again resulting in a much heavier load than designed for. This will result in signal loss and possibly even damage.
An active mixer, using for example [[Operational amplifier applications#Summing amplifier|op-amps]], 
should be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = Outputs are low impedance and must only be connected to high impedance inputs -- never, never tie two outputs directly together -- never. If you do, then each output tries to drive the very low impedance of the other, forcing both outputs into current-limit and possible damage. As a minimum, severe signal loss results.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A large resistor in series with each output can be used to safely mix them together, but must be appropriately designed for the load impedance and cable length.

== Line in ==
[[File:Line in symbol.svg|28px]]  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[File:Line waves03-2-in.png|42px]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[File:Line waves03-3-in.png|35px]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[File:Line circle in.png|35px]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Line-in symbol. [[PC System Design Guide#Color-coding scheme for connectors and ports|PC Guide color]] {{color box|lightblue}} light blue.

It is intended by designers that the line out of one device be connected to the line input of another.  Line inputs are designed to accept voltage levels in the range provided by line outputs. 
Impedances, on the other hand, are deliberately not matched from output to input. 
The impedance of a line input is typically around {{nowrap|10 kΩ}}. 
When driven by a line output's usual low impedance of 100 to 600 ohms, this forms a "bridging" connection in which most of the voltage generated by the source (the output) is dropped across the load (the input), and minimal current flows due to the load's relatively high impedance.

Although line inputs have a high impedance compared to that of line outputs, 
they should not be confused with so-called "Hi-Z" inputs (Z being the symbol for [[electrical impedance|impedance]]) which have an impedance of {{nowrap|47 kΩ}} to over {{nowrap|1 MΩ}}. These "Hi-Z" or "instrument" inputs generally have higher gain than a line input.
They are designed to be used with, for example, electric guitar pickups and "[[DI unit|direct injection]]" boxes. 
Some of these sources can provide only minimal voltage and current and the high impedance input is designed to not load them excessively.

== Line level in traditional signal paths ==
[[Acoustics|Acoustic]] sounds (such as [[register (music)|voice]]s or [[musical instrument]]s) are often recorded with [[transducer]]s ([[microphone]]s and [[Pick up (music technology)|pickup]]s) that produce weak electrical signals. These signals must be amplified to line level, where they are more easily manipulated by other devices such as mixing consoles and tape recorders.  Such amplification is performed by a device known as a [[preamplifier]] or "preamp", 
which boosts the signal to line level. 
After manipulation at line level, signals are then typically sent to a [[power amplifier]], where they are amplified to levels that can drive [[headphone]]s or [[loudspeaker]]s. These convert the signals back into sounds that can be heard through the air.

Most [[phonograph]] cartridges also have a low output level and require a preamp; typically, a home stereo integrated amplifier or receiver will have a special [[phono input]]. This input passes the signal through a phono preamp, which applies [[RIAA equalization]] to the signal as well as boosting it to line level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6459">'''Mexican inventions and discoveries''' are objects, processes or techniques invented or discovered, partially or entirely, by a person from [[Mexico]]. These also include concepts or practices introduced by [[Mexican people]] and their indigenous ancestors. Some of the objects, processes or techniques developed in the [[Pre-Columbian era]] were also invented or discovered independently in other cultures. This list shows only inventions and discoveries first introduced in present-day Mexican territory, or those that vary significantly in concept, figure, or use.

==Pre-Hispanic==
*[[Chinampa]]: Invented in central Mexico around 600 CE
*[[Popcorn]]: First invented by the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] and later introduced to [[Hernan Cortes]] by the [[Aztec]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aztec-history.com/aztec-inventions.html]. Aztec History. Retrieved February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mesoamerican rubber balls|Rubber ball]]: Before 1600 BCE by the [[Olmec]] for uncertain purposes and later used by the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] and Aztec for ball games. 
*[[Mesoamerican ballgame]]: Played differently by the Mayan and the Aztec, it is believed to be one of the first ball games, if not the first. 
*[[Chewing gum]] ancient Aztecs used chile as a base for making a gum-like substance and to stick objects together in everyday use. Women, in particular, used this type of gum as a mouth freshener.
*Processing of [[latex rubber|rubber latex]] as rubber. Although [[vulcanization]] with heat or sulfur was neither known nor practised, mesoamerican peoples used the juice of the [[Ipomoea alba|morning glory]] vine to similarly cross-link raw rubber and make it usable.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13158">[[Sony]] regularly released [[firmware]] updates for its [[PlayStation Portable]] system, and encouraged PSP owners to upgrade the [[PlayStation Portable system software|PSP system software]]. To increase system software upgrades, Sony encoded their games so that some of them require newer versions of the system software. This is a list of PSP games having such requirements. All system software updates are backwards-compatible; that is, all games that work on system software version 1.5 will work on version 2.0, and so on.

'''Micro-Opto-Electro-Mechanical Systems''' ('''MOEMS''') are not a special class of [[MEMS|Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems]] (MEMS) but rather the combination of  MEMS merged with Micro-optics; this involves sensing or manipulating optical signals on a very small size scale using integrated mechanical, optical, and electrical systems. MOEMS includes a wide variety of devices including [[optical switch]], [[optical cross-connect]], tunable [[Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser|VCSEL]], [[microbolometers]] amongst others. These devices are usually fabricated using micro-optics and standard micromachining technologies using materials like [[silicon]], silicon dioxide, silicon nitride and [[gallium arsenide]].

[[MOEMS#History of MOEMS|MOEMS]] includes two major technologies, [[MEMS]] and Micro-optics. Both these two technologies independently involve in batch processing similar to integrated circuits, and micromachining similar to fabrication of microsensor.

MEMS offers inherently device miniaturization and wide applications in sensors and actuators, robotics, accelerometers, microvalves, flow controllers, global positioning systems ([[GPS]]) component miniaturization; and a host of other sensors and actuators for applications to space, air, land, and sea vehicles, as well as industrial, biotechnology, and consumer electronics

During the 1980s the acronym of MEMS created a fortune for publication, getting government contracts and publicity. [[DARPA]] assigned a program manager for this field and significantly soon MEMS is promoted to be the king of the technology. Several high tech journals that were originated were attached to MEMS by supporting miniaturization and low cost manufacturing. Many private companies which did not have sufficient knowledge about MEMS also started jumping on the bandwagon.

Parallel with MEMS developments and even earlier, sensor technology advanced to microsensors and joining with microactuators. Development of microsensors and microactuators were also due to a mother technology of micromachining. Micromachining is the root of everything we have today in high technology. This technology was never credited in history as it deserved. It was commercially used during the 1960s in Switzerland, for [[Microelectromechanical systems|micromachining]] [[quartz]] orders of magnitudes harder than micromachining silicon. MEMS acronym was so powerful during the 1980s, that with no choice microsensors and microactuators that included micromachining, all joined MEMS by a soft landing. As a result, the MEMS acronym was more attractive for publicity and even today [[MEMS]], is dominating in microtechnologies without giving credit to its real parents.

During the MEMS era, and before that time frame, Rockwell International was involved in commercial MEMS development under government contracts. During early 1980s Rockwell successfully built the first CMOS MEMS high performance and high G accelerometer chip for space applications.&lt;ref&gt;M.  E.  Motamedi,  " Acoustic  Accelerometers ",  IEEE Trans. on Ultrasonic’s,  Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control,  Vol. UFFC-34,  No. 2,  P. 237, March 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The wafer was processed inside Rockwell [[VLSI Technology|VLSI]] lab in Anaheim, CA. This was a breakthrough in MEMS technology, but it did not appear in literature until 1988.

During the early 1990s, Rockwell Science Center, through internal research and commercial programs with government sponsors, contributed to the development of micro-optics technology Teamed with MIT/Lincoln-Lab. During 1992, Rockwell applied micro-optics to the system development of several industrial applications, including, microlenses for silicon focal planes,&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Motamedi, et al, “Silicon Microlenses for Enhanced Optical Coupling to Silicon Focal Planes”, Proceedings of [[SPIE]], 1544, pp. 22-32, July 1991&lt;/ref&gt; high speed binary microlens in GaAs,&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Motamedi, et al, “High Speed Binary Microlens in GaAs”, Proceedings, [[SPIE]], 1544, pp. 33–44, July 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; antireflection surfaces in silicon,&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Motamedi, et al, “Antireflection surfaces in Silicon Using binary Optic Technology,” Applied Optics, 1 August 1992, Vo., 31, No 22, pp 4371-4376.&lt;/ref&gt; thin film microlens arrays,&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Motamedi, et al, “FPAs and thin film binary optic microlens integration”, [[SPIE]] 2687, 70-77, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; beam steering device,&lt;ref&gt;M. E. Motamedi, et al, “Laser Beam Steering Device”  Conference on Binary Optics,    Huntsville, AL, NASA publication No. 3227, PP 345-358, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; microlens integration with focal plane arrays,&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Motamedi, et al, “Micro-optics integration with focal plane arrays, ” Optical  Eng.  vol. 36, No. 5, p.p. 1374-1382, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and optical transformer and collimator.&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Motamedi, et al, “Optical transformer and collimator for fiber coupling,” will be published in proceeding of upcoming [[SPIE]] conference on "Miniaturized Systems with Micro-optics and Micromechanics II," in San Jose, CA, on February 8–14, 1997. (invited paper)&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell Science Center also developed refractive microlens technology, including gray scale photolithography.&lt;ref&gt;H.O. Sankur, et al, Fabrication of IR microlens arrays by reactive ion milling,” [[SPIE]]    Proceeding of Miniature and Micro-optics and Micromechanics, 2687, pp 150-155, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Diffractive microlenses based on binary optic structures are typically fabricated in bulk material by multiple sequential layers of photoresist patterning and reactive ion etching (RIE), to form a multi-step phase profile. This profile approximates the ideal kinoform lens surface. A special staircase process, called binary optics, is used to fabricate diffractive components.

With so many successes in Micro-optics and MEMS, Rockwell researchers who were involved in both MEMS and Micro-optics, initiate development of several of innovative photonics ideas combining both technologies. This was behind the acronym of MOEMS, when both MEMS and Micro-optics were merged in one single IC processing lab.

MOEMS is a promising multi technology for miniaturization of critical optical systems. The acronym is defined of three high tech fields of micro-optics, micromechanics, and microelectronics. MOEMS indirectly could merge in micromachining, microsensors and microactuators if their processes are compatible with integrated circuits.

Merging all these multi technologies, made MOEMS an ideal knowhow for many industrial demonstrations of commercial devices, such as optical switches, [[digital micromirror device| digital micromirror devices or DMD]] (see [[digital light processing|DLP]]), bistable mirrors, laser scanners, optical shutters, and dynamic micromirror displays. All technologies of MOEMS have the potential of batch processing and embossed replication which, again, makes them highly attractive and necessary for commercial applications. MOEMS is an enabling technology for applications that cannot be addressed, using micro-optics alone and is currently playing a significant role in numerous optical applications. The trend toward miniaturization and integration of conventional optical systems will accelerate the adoption of MOEMS technology in commercialization of many industrial components which are today’s most desirable elements of optical communication.

==History of MOEMS==

During 1991-1993, Dr. M. Edward Motamedi, a former Rockwell International innovator in the areas of both Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and Micro-optics, used internally the acronym of MOEMS for Micro-Opto-Electro-Mechanical Systems. This was to distinguish between Optical MEMS and MOEMS, where Optical MEMS could include bulk optics but MOEMS is truly based on microtechnology where MOEMS devices are batched processed exactly like integrated circuits, but this is not true in most cases for Optical MEMS.

In 1993, Dr. Motamedi officially introduced MOEMS for the first time, as the powerful combination of MEMS and Micro-optics, in an invited talk at the [[SPIE]] Critical Reviews of Optical Science and Technology conference in San Diego. In this talk Dr. Motamedi introduced the figure below, for showing that MOEMS is the interaction of three major microtechnologies; namely Micro-optics, Micromechanics, and Microelectronics.&lt;ref&gt;M. E. Motamedi, "Merging Micro-optics with Micromechanics: Micro-Opto-Electro-Mechanical (MOEM) devices", Critical Reviews of Optical Science and Technology, V. CR49, [[SPIE]] Annual Meeting, Proceeding of Diffractive and Miniaturized Optics, page 302-328, July, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16432">'''Microwave imaging''' is a science which has been evolved from older detecting/locating techniques (e.g., [[radar]]) in order to evaluate hidden or embedded objects in a structure (or media)using [[electromagnetic]] (EM) waves in [[microwave]] regime (i.e., ~300&amp;nbsp;MHz-300&amp;nbsp;GHz).&lt;ref name="handle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10355/41515|title=Synthetic aperture radar-based techniques and reconfigurable antenna design for microwave imaging of layered structures|publisher=hdl.handle.net|accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Engineering]] and application oriented microwave imaging for [[non-destructive testing]] is called '''[[Microwave imaging#Microwave testing|microwave testing]]''', see below. 

Microwave imaging techniques can be classified as either quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative imaging techniques (are also known as inverse scattering methods) give the electrical (i.e., electrical and magnetic property distribution) and geometrical parameters (i.e., shape, size and location) of an imaged object by solving a nonlinear inverse problem. The nonlinear inverse problem is converted into a linear inverse problem (i.e., Ax=b where A and b are known and x (or image) is unknown) by using Born or distorted Born approximations. Despite the fact that direct matrix inversion methods can be invoked to solve the inversion problem, this will be so costly when the size of the problem is so big (i.e., when A is a very dense and big matrix). To overcome this problem, direct inversion is replaced with iterative solvers. Techniques in this class are called forward iterative methods which are usually time consuming.
On the other hand, qualitative microwave imaging methods calculate a qualitative profile (which is called as reflectivity function or qualitative image) to represent the hidden object. These techniques use approximations to simplify the imaging problem and then they use back-propagation (also called time reversal, phase compensation, or  back-migration) to reconstruct the unknown image profile. [[Synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR), [[ground-penetrating radar]] (GPR), and frequency-wave number migration algorithm are some of the most popular qualitative microwave imaging methods&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Principles==
In general, a microwave imaging system is made up of hardware and software components. The hardware collects data from the sample under test. A transmitting [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] sends EM waves towards the sample under test (e.g., human body for medical imaging). If the sample is made of only homogeneous material and is of infinite size, theoretically no EM wave will be reflected. Introduction of any anomaly which has different properties (i.e., electrical/magnetic) in comparison with the surrounding homogeneous medium may reflect a portion of the EM wave. The bigger the difference between the properties of the anomaly and the surrounding medium is, the stronger the reflected wave will be. This reflection is collected by the same antenna in a monostatic system, or a different receiver antenna in bistatic configurations.
[[File:A General View of a Microwave Imaging System.JPG|thumbnail|A general view of a microwave imaging system. (http://hdl.handle.net/10355/41515)]]
To increase the cross-range resolution of the imaging system, several antennas should be distributed over an area (which is called the sampling area) with a spacing less than the operating wavelength. However, the mutual coupling between the antennas, which are placed close to each other, may degrade the accuracy of the collected signals. Moreover, the transmitter and receiver system will become very complex. To address these problems, one single scanning antenna is used instead of several antennas. In this configuration, the antenna scans over the entire sampling area, and the collected data is mapped together with their antenna position coordinates. In fact, a synthetic (virtual) aperture is produced by moving the antenna (similar to the synthetic aperture radar principle&lt;ref&gt;M. Soumekh, Synthetic Aperture Radar Signal Processing, 1st ed. New York, NY, USA: Wiley, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;).    
Later, the collected data, which is sometimes referred to as raw data, is fed into the software for processing. Depending on the applied processing algorithm, microwave imaging techniques can be categorized as quantitative and qualitative.

==Applications==
Microwave imaging has been used in a variety of applications such as: nondestructive testing and evaluation (NDT&amp;E, see below), medical imaging, concealed weapon detection at security check points, structural health monitoring, and through-the-wall imaging.

Microwave imaging for medical applications is also becoming of more interest. The dielectric properties of malignant tissue change significantly in comparison with the properties of normal tissue (e.g., breast tissue). This difference translates into a contrast which can be detected by microwave imaging methods. As one example, there are several research groups all around the world working on developing efficient microwave imaging techniques for early detection of breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Bond E J, Li X, Hagness S C and Van Veen B D 2003 Microwave imaging via space-time beamforming for early detection of breast cancer IEEE Trans. Antennas Propagat. 51 1690-705&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:3D image of rebars with corrosion produced using microwave imaging..JPG|thumb|3D image of rebars with corrosion produced using microwave imaging, http://hdl.handle.net/10355/41515]]
Ageing of infrastructure is becoming a serious problem worldwide. For example, in reinforced concrete structures, corrosion of their steel reinforcements is the main cause of their deterioration. In U.S. alone, repair and maintenance cost due to such corrosion is about $276 billion per year,&lt;ref&gt;G. Roqueta, L. Jofre, and M. Feng, “Microwave Non-Destructive evaluation of corrosion in reinforced concrete structures,” in Proc. 5th Eur. Conf.Antennas Propagation (EUCAP),Apr. 11–15, 2011, pp. 787–791.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;.

Recently, microwave imaging has shown great potential to be used for structural health monitoring. Lower frequency microwaves (e.g., &lt;10&amp;nbsp;GHz) can easily penetrate through concrete and reach objects of interest such as reinforcement bars (rebars). If there is any rust on the rebar, since rust reflects less EM waves in comparison with sound metal, the microwave imaging method can distinguish between rebars with and without rust (or corrosion).{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Microwave imaging also can be used to detect any embedded anomaly inside concrete (e.g., crack or air void).

These applications of microwave imaging are part of non-destructuve (NDT) testing in civil engineering. More on microwave imaging in NDT is described in the following.

== Microwave testing ==
Microwave testing uses the scientific basics of microwave imaging for the inspection of technical parts with harmless [[microwaves]]. Microwave testing is one of the methods of [[non-destructive testing]] (NDT). It is restricted to tests of dielectric, i. e. non-conducting material. It can be used to inspect components also in a built-in state, e. g. built-in non-visible gaskets in plastic valves.

=== Principle ===
[[File:Rohr TIFF.tif|thumb|GFRP pipe wall. C-scan. In the middle: indication of a defect in 60 mm depth, 24 GHz]]
The microwave frequencies extend from 300&amp;nbsp;MHz to 300&amp;nbsp;GHz corresponding to wavelengths between 1&amp;nbsp;m and 1&amp;nbsp;mm. The section from 30&amp;nbsp;GHz to 300&amp;nbsp;GHz with wavelengths between 10&amp;nbsp;mm and 1&amp;nbsp;mm is also called [[Extremely high frequency|millimeter waves]]. Microwaves are in the order of the size of the components to be tested. In different [[dielectric media]] they propagate differently fast and at surfaces between them they are reflected. Another part propagates beyond the surface. The larger the difference in the [[wave impedance]], the larger is the reflected part.

In order to find material defects, a test probe, attached or in a small distance, is moved over the surface of the device under test. This can be done manually or automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mvg-world.com/en/products/field_product_family/industrial-inspection-5/dentro-lrx|title=Application note from MVG/Satimo. 2 September 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test probe transmits and receives microwaves.

Changes of the dielectric properties at surfaces (e. g. shrinkage cavities, pores, foreign material inclusion, or cracks) within the interior of the device under test reflect the incident microwave and send a part of it back to the test probe, which acts as a transmitter and as a receiver.

The electronic data evaluation leads to a display of the results, e. g. as a [http://www.ndt.net/article/pow1297/schmid/schmid6.htm B-scan] (cross sectional view) or as a [http://www.ndt.net/article/pow1297/schmid/schmid6.htm C-scan] (top view). These display methods are adopted from ultrasonic testing. 
[[File:P01 Rueckseite TIFF.tif|thumb|NIDIT through transmission image of a rotor blade trailing edge with artificially distributed adhesive]]

=== Procedures ===
Besides the reflection method also the through transmission method is possible, in which separate transmit and receive antennas are used. The backside of the device under test (DUT) must be accessible and the method gives no information about the depth of a defect within the DUT.

Microwave tests are possible with constant frequency ([[Continuous-wave radar|CW]]) or with continuously tuned frequency ([[Continuous-wave radar|FMCW]]). FMCW is advantageous to determine the depth of defects within the DUT.

A test probe attached to the DUT's surface gives information about the material distribution below the point of contact. When moving over the DUT surface point by point many such information is stored and then evaluated to give an overall image. This takes time. Directly imaging procedures are faster: Microwave versions are either electronic&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.rohde-schwarz.com/pws/dl_downloads/dl_common_library/dl_news_from_rs/216/NEWS_216__QPS_english.pdf|title=Security through technology Information of ROHDE &amp; SCHWARZ GmbH &amp; Co.

=== Applications ===
Microwave testing is a useful NDT method for [[dielectric]] materials. Among them are [[plastics]], [[Fiberglass|glass-fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP)]], [[Plastic foam|plastic foams]], [[wood]], [[Wood-plastic composite|wood-plastic composites (WPC)]], and most types of [[ceramics]]. Defects interior in the DUT and at its surface can be detected, e. g. in semi-finished products or [[Piping|pipes]].

In the last years the need for NDT has increased generally and especially also for dielectric materials. For this reason and because microwave technics more and more are used in consumer products and hereby became much less expensive, NDT with microwaves increases. In recognizing this growing importance, in 2011 the ''Expert committee for microwave and THz procedures''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dgzfp.de/Fachaussch%C3%BCsse/Mikrowellen-u-Terahertzverfahren|title=Expert Committee MTHz of the DGZfP - 2 September 2017.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the German Society of Non-Destructive Testing (DGZfP) was founded as in 2014 the ''Microwave Testing Committee'' of the American Society for Non-Destructive Testing (ASNT). Standardization work is at the beginning.

'''MikroElektronika''' (stylized as '''MikroE''') is a Serbian manufacturer and retailer of hardware and software tools for developing [[embedded system]]s. The company headquarters is in [[Belgrade]], Serbia.

Its best known software products are mikroC, mikroBasic and mikroPascal [[compiler]]s for programming [[microcontroller]]s. Its flagship hardware product line is Click boards, a range of more than 550 add-on boards for interfacing microcontrollers with peripheral sensors or transceivers. These boards conform to mikroBUS – a standard&lt;ref name="mikroBUS standard"&gt;[https://download.mikroe.com/documents/standards/mikrobus/mikrobus-standard-specification-v200.pdf Official mikroBUS standard specifications published by MikroElektronika]&lt;/ref&gt; conceived by MikroElektronika and later endorsed by [[NXP Semiconductors]]&lt;ref name="NXP Semiconductors endorses mikroBUS"&gt;[http://www.nxp.com/assets/documents/data/en/supporting-information/NXP-NFC-Click-Hexiwear-PR.pdf NXP announces mikroBUS-based NFC click board as removing barrier of adoption to NXP NFC technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Microchip Technology]],&lt;ref name="Microchip endorses mikroBUS"&gt;[https://www.microchip.com/pressreleasepage/announcing-two-new-low-cost-feature-rich-pic32-curiosity-development-boards-from-microchip Microchip announces release of its Curiosity development board with mikroBUS sockets for click boards]&lt;/ref&gt; among others. MikroElektronika is also known for Hexiwear, an Internet of Things development kit developed in partnership with NXP Semiconductors.&lt;ref name="NXP Semiconductors"&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160222006196/en/NXP-Accelerates-Smart-Wearable-Product-Development NXP announces release of Hexiwear]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Serbian entrepreneur — and current company owner and CEO — Nebojša Matić started publishing an electronics magazine called "MikroElektronika" in 1997.&lt;ref name="MikroElektronika Company history"&gt;[https://www.mikroe.com/about/history/ Company history from MikroElektronika's website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the magazine was shut down and MikroElektronika repositioned itself as a company focused on producing development boards for microcontrollers and publishing books for developing embedded systems.

The company started offering compilers in 2004, with the release of mikroPascal for PIC and mikroBasic for PIC — compilers for programming 8-bit microcontrollers from Microchip Technology. Between 2004 and 2015 the company released C, Basic and Pascal compilers for seven microcontroller architectures: PIC, PIC32, dsPIC/PIC24, FT90x, AVR, 8051, and ARM® (supporting STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments and Mircochip-based ARM® Cortex microcontrollers).

In conjunction with compilers, MikroElektronika kept its focus on producing development boards while gradually ceasing its publishing activities. Its current generation of the "Easy" boards brand was released in 2012. One of the flagship models, EasyPIC Fusion v7 was nominated for best tool at the Embedded World 2013 exhibition in Nurembeg,&lt;ref name="EasyPIC Fusion nomination"&gt;[https://www.embedded-world.de/en/highlights/embedded-award embedded AWARD winners and nominees list 2005-2016]&lt;/ref&gt; an important embedded systems industry gathering. Other product lines were introduced as well, including the "mikroProg" line of hardware programmers and debuggers, and the range of sensor and transceiver add-on boards known as click boards.

During this time span the company developed relationships with various semiconductor vendors and distributors. It became an official partner of [[Microchip Technology]], [[NXP Semiconductors]], [[Texas Instruments]], [[STMicroelectronics]], [[Imagination Technologies]], [[Telit]], Quectel, and [[U-blox]].&lt;ref name="MikroElektronika partners"&gt;[http://www.mikroe.com/about Official Partners listed on MikroElektronika's website]&lt;/ref&gt; MikroElektronika also built up its worldwide distributor network by partnering with [[Digi-Key]], [[Mouser Electronics]], [[Future Electronics]], [[RS Components]] as well as more than 50 local distributors in all continents.&lt;ref name="MikroElektronika distributors"&gt;[http://www.mikroe.com/distributors Official distributors listed on MikroElektronika's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to rising public interest in the [[Internet of things]], in 2016 MikroElektronika released Hexiwear, a wearable development kit created in partnership with NXP Semiconductors. Hexiwear was funded through Kickstarter.&lt;ref name="Hexiwear on Kickstarter"&gt;[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1351029401/hexiwear-a-wearable-development-kit-for-the-iot-er Hexiwear Kickstarter page]&lt;/ref&gt; Since its release on the market, it won four industry awards: Best in Show, Reader's choice, and Best IoT product at ARM TechCon 2016 Innovation Challenge,&lt;ref name="ARM TechCon"&gt;[http://www.armtechcon.com/2016-innovation-challenge-winners-demonstrate-exceptional-arm-creativity/ ARM TechCon official award winners announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 ECN Impact award,&lt;ref name="Hexiwear ECN Impact Award"&gt;[https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/11/03/886335/0/en/Hexiwear-IoT-and-Wearable-Platform-Powered-by-NXP-Wins-Multiple-Prominent-Industry-Awards.html NXP announces Hexiwear winning ECN Impact award]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Best for Rapid prototyping at the Hackster Maker Madness competition.&lt;ref name="Hackster Maker Madness"&gt;[https://blog.hackster.io/maker-madness-the-best-iot-boards-of-2016-cfc2382daf64#.x0ycgrajn Maker Madness winners announced on Hackster blog ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mobile telephony''' is the provision of [[telecommunication|telephone service]]s to [[mobile phone|phones]] which may [[roaming|move around freely]] rather than stay [[landline|fixed]] in one location.  Mobile phones connect to a terrestrial [[cellular network]] of [[base station]]s ([[cell site]]s), whereas [[satellite phone]]s connect to orbiting [[satellite]]s.  Both networks are interconnected to the [[public switched telephone network]] ([[PSTN]]) to allow any phone in the world to be dialed.

In 2010 there were estimated to be [[List of countries by number of mobile phones in use|five billion mobile cellular subscriptions in the world]].

== History ==
{{main|History of mobile phones|History of the prepaid mobile phone}}

According to internal memos, [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]] discussed developing a wireless phone in 1915, but were afraid that deployment of the technology could undermine its monopoly on wired service in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Public mobile phone systems were first introduced in the years after the Second World War and made use of technology developed before and during the conflict. The first system opened in St Louis, Missouri, USA in 1946 whilst other countries followed in the succeeding decades. The UK introduced its 'System 1' manual radiotelephone service as the South Lancashire Radiophone Service in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagelibrary.btplc.com/assetbank-btplc/action/viewAsset?id=1895&amp;index=0&amp;total=21&amp;categoryId=215&amp;categoryTypeId=1&amp;collection=Mobile%20communications&amp;sortAttributeId=0&amp;sortDescending=false |title=Asset Bank &amp;#124; Image Details |publisher=Imagelibrary.btplc.com |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calls were made via an operator using handsets identical to ordinary phone handsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagelibrary.btplc.com/assetbank-btplc/action/viewAsset?id=1857&amp;index=15&amp;total=21&amp;collection=Mobile%20communications&amp;categoryId=215&amp;categoryTypeId=1&amp;filterId=0&amp;sortAttributeId=0&amp;sortDescending=false |title=Asset Bank &amp;#124; Image Details |publisher=Imagelibrary.btplc.com |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phone itself was a large box located in the boot (trunk) of the vehicle containing valves and other early electronic components. Although an uprated manual service ('System 3') was extended to cover most of the UK, automation did not arrive until 1981 with 'System 4'.  Although this non-cellular service, based on German [[B-Netz]] technology, was expanded rapidly throughout the UK between 1982 and 1985 and continued in operation for several years before finally closing in Scotland, it was overtaken by the introduction in January 1985 of two cellular systems - the British Telecom/Securicor 'Cellnet' service and the Racal/Millicom/Barclays 'Vodafone' (from voice + data + phone) service. These cellular systems were based on US [[Advanced Mobile Phone Service]] (AMPS) technology, the modified technology being named [[Total Access Communication System]] (TACS).

In 1947 Bell Labs was the first to propose a cellular radio telephone network. The primary innovation was the development of a network of small overlapping cell sites supported by a call switching infrastructure that tracks users as they move through a network and passes their calls from one site to another without dropping the connection. In 1956 the [[MTD (mobile network)|MTA]] system was launched in Sweden. The early efforts to develop mobile telephony faced two significant challenges: allowing a great number of callers to use the comparatively few available frequencies simultaneously and allowing users to seamlessly move from one area to another without having their calls dropped.  Both problems were solved by Bell Labs employee Amos Joel who, in 1970 applied for a patent for a mobile communications system.&lt;ref&gt;Patent No. 3,663,762, issued May 16, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a business consulting firm calculated the entire U.S. market for mobile telephones at 100,000 units and the entire worldwide market at no more than 200,000 units based on the ready availability of pay telephones and the high cost of constructing cell towers.  As a consequence, Bell Labs concluded that the invention was "of little or no consequence," leading it not to attempt to commercialize the invention.  The invention earned Joel induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of National Inventors Hall of Fame inductees]]&lt;/ref&gt;   The first call on a handheld mobile phone was made on April 3, 1973 by Martin Cooper, then of Motorola&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3g.co.uk/PR/April2003/5173.htm |title=30th Anniversary of First Wireless Cell Phone Call |publisher=3g.co.uk |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to his opposite number in Bell Labs who were also racing to be first.  Bell Labs went on to install the first trial cellular network in Chicago in 1978. This trial system was licensed by the FCC to ATT for commercial use in 1982 and, as part of the divestiture arrangements for the breakup of ATT, the AMPS technology was distributed to local telcos.  The first commercial system opened in Chicago in October 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Article by Larry Kahaner and Alan Green in the Chicago Tribune of December 22, 1983 [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/629023862.html Reach out and touch someone--by land, sea or air]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Phil Ament |url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/mobilephone.htm |title=Mobile Phone History - Invention of the Mobile Phone |publisher=Ideafinder.com |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A system designed by Motorola also operated in the Washington D.C./Baltimore area from summer 1982 and became a full public service later the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Visited and evaluated by a group of (soon-to-be) British Telecoms staff (including writer) in September 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  Japan's first commercial radiotelephony service was launched by [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation|NTT]] in 1978.

The first fully automatic [[1G|first generation]] cellular system was the [[Nordic Mobile Telephone]] (NMT) system, simultaneously launched in 1981 in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tekniskamuseet.se/mobilen/engelska/1980_90.shtml |title=Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology |publisher=Tekniskamuseet.se |accessdate=2009-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022043906/http://www.tekniskamuseet.se/mobilen/engelska/1980_90.shtml |archivedate=October 22, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; NMT was the first mobile phone network featuring international [[roaming]]. The Swedish electrical engineer [[Östen Mäkitalo]] started to work on this vision in 1966, and is considered as the father of the NMT system and some consider him also the father of the cellular phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharelie-download.com/?p=156 |title=Mobile and technology: The Basics of Mobile Phones |publisher=Sharelie-download.com |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilen50ar.se/eng/FaktabladENGFinal.pdf |title=Facts about the Mobile |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813122017/http://www.mobilen50ar.se/eng/FaktabladENGFinal.pdf |archivedate=August 13, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of cellular technology encouraged European countries to co-operate in the development of a pan-European cellular technology to rival those of the US and Japan. This resulted in the [[GSM]] system, the initials originally from the '''''Groupe Spécial Mobile''''' that was charged with the specification and development tasks but latterly as the 'Global System for Mobile Communications'. The GSM standard eventually spread outside Europe and is now the most widely used cellular technology in the world and the de facto standard. The industry association, the GSMA, now represents 219 countries and nearly 800 mobile network operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsmworld.com/membership/full_members.htm |title=Full Members ~ GSM World |publisher=Gsmworld.com |accessdate=2011-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711132322/http://www.gsmworld.com/membership/full_members.htm |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now estimated to be over 5 billion phone subscriptions according to the "[[List of countries by number of mobile phones in use]]" (although some users have multiple subscriptions, or inactive subscriptions), which also makes the mobile phone the most widely spread technology and the most common electronic device in the world.&lt;ref name="reuters50"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/11/29/cellphones-world-idINL2917209520071129 global cellphone penetration reaches 50 percent]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mobile phone to enable internet connectivity and wireless email, the [[Nokia Communicator]], was released in 1996, creating a new category of multi-use devices called smartphones. In 1999 the first mobile internet service was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan under the i-Mode service. By 2007 over 798 million people around the world accessed the internet or equivalent mobile internet services such as WAP and i-Mode at least occasionally using a mobile phone rather than a personal computer.

[[Image:Mobile phone subscribers per 100 inhabitants 1997-2007 ITU.png|thumb|250px|Mobile phone subscriptions, not subscribers, per 100 inhabitants 1997-2007]]
Mobile phones receive and send radio signals with any number of [[cell site]] base stations fitted with [[microwave]] [[radio|antenna]]s. These sites are usually mounted on a tower, pole or building, located throughout populated areas, then connected to a cabled communication network and switching system. The phones have a low-power [[transceiver]] that transmits voice and data to the nearest cell sites, normally not more than 8 to 13&amp;nbsp;km (approximately 5 to 8 miles) away.  In areas of low [[Coverage (telecommunication)|coverage]], a [[cellular repeater]] may be used, which uses a long distance high-gain [[dish antenna]] or [[yagi antenna]] to communicate with a cell tower far outside of normal range, and a repeater to rebroadcast on a small short-range local antenna that allows any cellphone within a few meters to function properly.

When the mobile phone or data device is turned on, it registers with the [[Mobile Switching Center|mobile telephone exchange]], or switch, with its unique identifiers, and can then be alerted by the mobile switch when there is an incoming telephone call. The handset constantly listens for the strongest signal being received from the surrounding base stations, and is able to [[Mobility management|switch seamlessly]] between sites. As the user moves around the network, the "[[handoff]]s" are performed to allow the device to switch sites without interrupting the call.

[[Cell site]]s have relatively low-power (often only one or two watts) radio transmitters which broadcast their presence and relay communications between the mobile handsets and the switch. The switch in turn connects the call to another subscriber of the same [[wireless service provider]] or to the [[PSTN|public telephone network]], which includes the networks of other wireless carriers. Many of these sites are camouflaged to blend with existing environments, particularly in scenic areas.

The dialogue between the handset and the cell site is a stream of digital data that includes digitised audio (except for the first generation analog networks). The technology that achieves this depends on the system which the [[mobile phone operator]] has adopted. The technologies are grouped by generation. The first-generation systems started in 1979 with Japan, are all analog and include AMPS and NMT. Second-generation systems, started in 1991 in Finland, are all digital and include [[GSM]], [[CDMA]] and [[Digital AMPS|TDMA]].

The nature of cellular technology renders many phones vulnerable to 'cloning': anytime a cell phone moves out of [[Coverage (telecommunication)|coverage]] (for example, in a road tunnel), when the signal is re-established, the phone sends out a 're-connect' signal to the nearest cell-tower, identifying itself and signalling that it is again ready to transmit.  With the proper equipment, it's possible to intercept the re-connect signal and encode the data it contains into a 'blank' phone—in all respects, the 'blank' is then an exact duplicate of the real phone and any calls made on the 'clone' will be charged to the original account.  This problem was widespread with the first generation analogue technology, however the modern digital standards such as [[GSM]] greatly improve security and make cloning hard to achieve.

In an effort to limit the potential harm from having a transmitter close to the user's body, the first fixed/mobile cellular phones that had a separate transmitter, vehicle-mounted antenna, and handset (known as ''car phones'' and ''bag phones'') were limited to a maximum 3 watts [[Effective Radiated Power]]. Modern ''handheld'' cellphones which must have the transmission antenna held inches from the user's skull are limited to a maximum transmission power of 0.6 watts ERP. Regardless of the potential biological effects, the reduced transmission range of modern handheld phones limits their usefulness in rural locations as compared to car/bag phones, and handhelds require that cell towers are spaced much closer together to compensate for their lack of transmission power.

An increasing number of countries, particularly in Europe, now have more mobile phones than people. According to the figures from Eurostat, the European Union's in-house statistical office, Luxembourg had the highest [[mobile phone penetration rate]] at 158 mobile subscriptions per 100 people, closely followed by Lithuania and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7116599.stm |title=Europeans hang up on fixed lines |publisher=BBC News  |date=2007-11-28 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hong Kong the penetration rate reached 139.8% of the population in July 2007.&lt;ref name="OFTA"&gt;[http://www.ofta.gov.hk/en/datastat/key_stat.html Office of the Telecommunications Authority in Hong Kong] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309133237/http://www.ofta.gov.hk/en/datastat/key_stat.html |date=March 9, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 50 countries have mobile phone subscription penetration rates higher than that of the population and the Western European average penetration rate was 110% in 2007 (source Informa 2007). Canada currently has the lowest rates of mobile phone penetrations in the industrialised world at 58%.

There are over five hundred million active mobile phone accounts in China, as of 2007, but the total penetration rate there still stands below 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itfacts.biz/index.php?id=P8549 |title=500 mln cell phone accounts in China |publisher=ITFacts Mobile usage |accessdate=2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of mobile phone subscribers in the world was estimated at 2.14 billion in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mobiletracker.net/archives/2005/05/18/mobile-subcribers-worldwide|title=Total mobile subscribers top 1.8 billion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subscriber count reached 2.7 billion by end of 2006 according to Information{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}, and 3.3 billion by November, 2007,&lt;ref name="reuters50"/&gt; thus reaching an equivalent of over half the planet's population. Around 80% of the world's population has access to mobile phone coverage, as of 2006. This figure is expected to increase to 90% by the year 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/2006/10/013841.htm |title=Up to 90 percent of globe to have mobile coverage |publisher=Textually.org |date=2006-10-17 |accessdate=2011-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716205958/http://www.textually.org/textually/archives/2006/10/013841.htm |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some  [[Developing country|developing countries]] with little  "landline" telephone [[infrastructure]], mobile phone use has quadrupled in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sunherald.com/business/story/134849.html|title=Cell phone use booming worldwide|date=2007-09-15|accessdate=2007-09-15 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of mobile phone technology in developing countries is often cited as an example of the [[leapfrog effect]]. Many remote regions in the third world went from having no telecommunications infrastructure to having satellite based communications systems. At present, Africa has the largest growth rate of cellular subscribers in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4331863.stm|title=Mobile growth fastest in Africa |publisher=BBC News   | date = 2005-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; its markets expanding nearly twice as fast as Asian markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2068420,00.html|title=Phone revolution makes Africa upwardly mobile |work=The Times |location=UK | date = 2006-03-04  | first=Xan | last=Rice | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The availability of [[Prepaid telephone calls|prepaid]] or [[prepaid mobile phone|'pay-as-you-go']] services, where the subscriber is not committed to a long term contract, has helped fuel this growth in Africa as well as in other continents.

On a numerical basis, India is the largest growth market, adding about 6 million mobile phones every month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.trai.gov.in/trai/upload/PressReleases/511/pr22nov07no96.pdf |title= The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India |access-date= February 8, 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225003530/http://www.trai.gov.in/trai/upload/PressReleases/511/pr22nov07no96.pdf |archive-date= February 25, 2009 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(444&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently has a mobile subscriber base of 937.06 million mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trai.gov.in/WriteReadData/WhatsNew/Documents/PR-TSD-Nov-14.pdf|title=The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India|access-date=February 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208160907/http://www.trai.gov.in/WriteReadData/WhatsNew/Documents/PR-TSD-Nov-14.pdf|archive-date=February 8, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traffic ===

Since the world is operating quickly to 3G and 4G networks, mobile traffic through video is heading high. It is expected that by end of 2018, the global traffic will reach an annual rate of 190 exabytes/year. This is the result of people shifting to smartphones.
It is predicted by 2018, mobile traffic will reach by 10 billion connections with 94% traffic comes from Smartphones, laptops and tablets. Also 69% of mobile traffic from Videos since we have high definition screens available in smart phones and 176.9 wearable devices to be at use. Apparently, 4G will be dominating the traffic by 51% of total mobile data by 2018.&lt;ref name="Mobile Traffic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobile Network 2018|url=http://www.phoneam.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/93/2014/09/Mobile-network-through-2018-1.jpg|website=www.Phoneam.com|accessdate=8 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429094838/http://www.phoneam.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/93/2014/09/Mobile-network-through-2018-1.jpg|archivedate=April 29, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By government agencies ===

==== Law enforcement ====
{{Main|Lawful interception}}
Law enforcement have used mobile phone evidence in a number of different ways. Evidence about the physical location of an individual at a given time can be obtained by triangulating the individual's cellphone between several cellphone towers. This triangulation technique can be used to show that an individual's cellphone was at a certain location at a certain time. The concerns over terrorism and terrorist use of technology prompted an inquiry by the [[British House of Commons]] [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] into the use of evidence from mobile phone devices, prompting leading mobile telephone forensic specialists to identify forensic techniques available in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Committee Office, House of Commons |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhaff/910/910we17.htm |title=Supplementary memorandum submitted by Gregory Smith |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIST have published guidelines and procedures for the preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting of digital information present on mobile phones can be found under the NIST Publication SP800-101.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-101/SP800-101.pdf |title=Guidelines on Cell Phone Forensics }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.44&amp;nbsp;MB)}}, Recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK in 2000 it was claimed that recordings of mobile phone conversations made on the day of the [[Omagh bombing]] were crucial to the police investigation. In particular, calls made on two mobile phones which were tracked from south of the Irish border to Omagh and back on the day of the bombing, were considered of vital importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/965274.stm |title=Mobile phones key to Omagh probe |publisher=BBC News  |date=2000-10-10 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further example of criminal investigations using mobile phones is the initial location and ultimate identification of the terrorists of the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]]. In the attacks, mobile phones had been used to detonate the bombs. However, one of the bombs failed to detonate, and the [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]] card in the corresponding mobile phone gave the first serious lead about the terrorists to investigators. By tracking the whereabouts of the SIM card and correlating other mobile phones that had been registered in those areas, police were able to locate the terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nokia-n98.org/communication-safety.html |title=Communication safety |publisher=Nokia-n98.org |accessdate=2011-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224152045/http://nokia-n98.org/communication-safety.html |archive-date=December 24, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Disaster response ====

The Finnish government decided in 2005 that the fastest way to warn citizens of disasters was the mobile phone network. In Japan, mobile phone companies provide [[J-Alert|immediate notification]] of [[earthquake]]s and other [[natural disaster]]s to their customers free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mobilementalism.com/2007/11/19/new-japanese-phones-offer-earthquake-early-warning-alerts/ |title=New Japanese phones offer Earthquake early warning alerts |accessdate=2008-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121074424/http://mobilementalism.com/2007/11/19/new-japanese-phones-offer-earthquake-early-warning-alerts/ |archivedate=January 21, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the event of an emergency, [[disaster response]] crews can locate trapped or injured people using the signals from their mobile phones. An interactive menu accessible through the phone's [[Web browser|Internet browser]] notifies the company if the user is safe or in distress.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In Finland rescue services suggest hikers carry mobile phones in case of emergency even when deep in the forests beyond [[cellular coverage]], as the radio signal of a cellphone attempting to connect to a base station can be detected by overflying rescue aircraft with special detection gear. Also, users in the United States can sign up through their provider for free text messages when an [[AMBER Alert]] goes out for a missing person in their area.

However, most mobile phone networks operate close to capacity during normal times, and spikes in call volumes caused by widespread emergencies often [[mass call event|overload the system]] just when it is needed the most.  Examples reported in the media where this has occurred include the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003|2003 Northeast blackouts]], the [[July 7, 2005 London bombings|2005 London Tube bombings]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], the [[2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake]], and the [[Minnesota bridge collapse|2007 Minnesota bridge collapse]].

Under FCC regulations, all mobile telephones must be capable of dialing [[emergency telephone number]]s, regardless of the presence of a SIM card or the payment status of the account.

=== Human behaviour ===

==== Culture and customs ====

[[Image:2003-09-23 Convenience of a cell phone.jpg|thumb|Cellular phones allow people to communicate from almost anywhere at their leisure.]]
Between the 1980s and the 2000s, the mobile phone has gone from being an expensive item used by the business elite to a pervasive,  personal communications tool for the general population. In most countries, mobile phones outnumber land-line phones, with fixed landlines numbering 1.3 billion but mobile subscriptions 3.3 billion at the end of 2007.

In many markets from Japan and South Korea, to Europe, to Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, most children age 8-9 have mobile phones and the new accounts are now opened for customers aged 6 and 7. Where mostly parents tend to give hand-me-down used phones to their youngest children, in Japan already new cameraphones are on the market whose target age group is under 10 years of age, introduced by KDDI in February 2007. The USA also lags on this measure, as in the US so far, about half of all children have mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.point.com/articles/2006/04/cell_phones_for.php |title=Mobile Phones for Kids Under 15: a Responsible Question |publisher=Point.com |date=2006-04-13 |accessdate=2011-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715101403/http://www.point.com/articles/2006/04/cell_phones_for.php |archivedate=July 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many [[Youth|young adult]]s' households it has supplanted the land-line phone. Mobile phone usage is banned in some countries, such as North Korea and restricted in some other countries such as Burma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.itv.com/news/world_6cddf71daffb714832920b344fc9e1f4.html | title = Rise in executions for mobile use | work = ITV News | date = 2007-06-15 | accessdate = 2007-06-23 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070817193211/http://www.itv.com/news/world_6cddf71daffb714832920b344fc9e1f4.html | archivedate = August 17, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the high levels of societal mobile phone service penetration, it is a key means for people to communicate with each other. The [[short message service|SMS]] feature spawned the "[[text message|texting]]" sub-culture amongst younger users. In December 1993, the first person-to-person SMS text message was transmitted in Finland. Currently, texting is the most widely used data service; 1.8 billion users generated $80 billion of revenue in 2006 (source ITU). Many phones offer [[Instant messaging|Instant Messenger]] services for simple, easy texting. Mobile phones have Internet service (e.g. [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s [[i-mode]]), offering text messaging via e-mail in Japan, South Korea, China, and India. Most mobile internet access is much different from computer access, featuring alerts, weather data, e-mail, search engines, instant messages, and game and music downloading; most mobile internet access is hurried and short.

Because mobile phones are often used publicly, social norms have been shown to play a major role in the usage of mobile phones.&lt;ref name="Social Science Computer Review"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://homepage.univie.ac.at/andreas.hergovich/php/reaching_the_mobile_respondent_soc.sci.comp.rev.pdf |title = Reaching the Mobile Respondent: Determinants of High-Level Mobile Phone Use Among a High-Coverage Group  |publisher = Social Science Computer Review |doi = 10.1177/0894439309353099}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the mobile phone can be a fashion [[totem]] custom-decorated to reflect the owner's personality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquino |first=Grace |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,125476-page,1/article.html |title=Cell Phone Fashion Show |work=PC World |date=2006-04-28 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be a part of their self-identity.&lt;ref name="Social Science Computer Review"/&gt; This aspect of the mobile telephony business is, in itself, an industry, e.g. [[ringtone]] sales amounted to $3.5 billion in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Gundersen, Edna, [https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/2006-11-28-mastertones-main_x.htm "Mastertones ring up profits"], USA Today, 11/29/2006&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Mobile phones on aircraft|Mobile phone use on aircraft]] is starting to be allowed with several airlines already offering the ability to use phones during flights. Mobile phone use during flights used to be prohibited and many airlines still claim in their in-plane announcements that this prohibition is due to possible interference with aircraft radio communications. Shut-off mobile phones do not interfere with aircraft avionics. The recommendation why phones should not be used during take-off and landing, even on planes that allow calls or messaging, is so that passengers pay attention to the crew for any possible accident situations, as most aircraft accidents happen on take-off and landing.

==== Etiquette ====
{{Main|Etiquette (technology)#Cell Phone Etiquette|l1=Cell Phone Etiquette}}
Mobile phone use can be an important matter of social discourtesy: phones ringing during funerals or weddings; in toilets, cinemas and theatres. Some [[book shops]], libraries, bathrooms, cinemas, doctors' offices and [[Place of worship|places of worship]] prohibit their use, so that other patrons will not be disturbed by conversations. Some facilities install [[mobile phone jammer|signal-jamming equipment]] to prevent their use, although in many countries, including the US, such equipment is illegal.

Many US cities with subway transit systems underground are studying or have implemented mobile phone reception in their underground tunnels for their riders, and trains, particularly those involving long-distance services, often offer a "quiet carriage" where phone use is prohibited, much like the designated non-smoking carriage of the past.  Most schools in the United States and Europe and Canada have prohibited mobile phones in the classroom, or in school in an effort to limit class disruptions.

A working group made up of Finnish telephone companies, public transport operators and communications authorities has launched a campaign to remind mobile phone users of courtesy, especially when using mass transit&amp;mdash;what to talk about on the phone, and how to. In particular, the campaign wants to impact loud mobile phone usage as well as calls regarding sensitive matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ficora.fi/index/viestintavirasto/lehdistotiedotteet/2007/P_51.html campaign to promote cell phone manners] (in finish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Use by drivers ====
{{Main|Mobile phones and driving safety|Handsfree}}
The use of mobile phones by people who are driving has become increasingly common, for example as part of their job, as in the case of delivery drivers who are calling a client, or socially as for commuters who are chatting with a friend. While many drivers have embraced the convenience of using their cellphone while driving, some jurisdictions have made the practice against the law, such as Australia, the Canadian provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[Quebec]], Ontario, [[Nova Scotia]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] as well as the United Kingdom, consisting of a zero-tolerance system operated in Scotland and a warning system operated in England, [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]]. Officials from these jurisdictions argue that using a mobile phone while driving is an impediment to vehicle operation that can increase the risk of road traffic accidents.

Studies have found vastly different [[relative risk]]s (RR). Two separate studies using case-crossover analysis each calculated RR at 4,&lt;ref name="Redelmeier "&gt;{{cite journal|last=Redelmeier |first=Donald |last2=Tibshirani |first2=Robert |title=Association Between Cellular-Telephone Calls And Motor Vehicle Collisions |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=336 |issue=7 |pages=453–458 |date=1997-02-13 |url=http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/departments/nrd-13/driver-distraction/PDF/5.PDF |doi=10.1056/NEJM199702133360701 |pmid=9017937 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118235610/http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/departments/nrd-13/driver-distraction/PDF/5.PDF |archivedate=January 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McEvoy"&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Suzanne | last = McEvoy | title = Role of mobile phones in motor vehicle crashes resulting in hospital attendance: a case-crossover study | year = 2005 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/bmj.38537.397512.55v1 | pmid = 16012176 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38537.397512.55 | journal=BMJ | volume = 331 | page = 428 | last2 = Stevenson | first2 = MR | last3 = McCartt | first3 = AT | last4 = Woodward | first4 = M | last5 = Haworth | first5 = C | last6 = Palamara | first6 = P | last7 = Cercarelli | first7 = R | issue = 7514 | pmc = 1188107}}&lt;/ref&gt; while an epidemiological [[cohort study]] found RR, when adjusted for crash-risk exposure, of 1.11 for men and 1.21 for women.&lt;ref name="Laberge-Nadeau2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Laberge-Nadeau | first = Claire | title = Wireless telephones and the risk of road crashes | journal=Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 649–660  |date=September 2003 | doi = 10.1016/S0001-4575(02)00043-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simulation study from the [[University of Utah]] Professor David Strayer compared drivers with a [[blood alcohol content]] of 0.08% to those conversing on a cell phone, and after controlling for driving difficulty and time on task, the study concluded that cell phone drivers exhibited greater impairment than intoxicated drivers.&lt;ref name="Strayer"&gt;{{cite web | first = David | last = Strayer | first2 = Frank | last2 = Drews | first3 = Dennis | last3 = Crouch | title = Fatal Distraction?

Two additional laws dealing with the use of wireless telephones while driving went into effect July 1, 2008. The first law prohibits all drivers from using a handheld wireless telephone while operating a motor vehicle. The law allows a driver to use a wireless telephone to make emergency calls to a law enforcement agency, a medical provider, the fire department, or other emergency services agency. The base fine for the FIRST offense is $20 and $50 for subsequent convictions. With penalty assessments, the fine can be more than triple the base fine amount.&lt;ref name="Wireless Communications Device Law"&gt;{{cite web|last=Domain|first=Public|title=Text Messaging Law Effective January 1, 2009 Cellular Phone Laws Effective July 1, 2008|url=http://www.dmv.ca.gov/cellularphonelaws/|work=California Department of Motor Vehicles|publisher=State of California|accessdate=19 August 2013|location=California, USA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807035634/http://www.dmv.ca.gov/cellularphonelaws/|archivedate=August 7, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20131121034154/http://apps.dmv.ca.gov/cellularphonelaws/videos/pop.htm videos about California cellular phone laws; with captions] (California Vehicle Code [VC] §23123).

==== Use on aircraft ====
{{main|Mobile phones on aircraft}}
As of 2007, several airlines are experimenting with base station and antenna systems installed on the airplane, allowing low power, short-range connection of any phones aboard to remain connected to the aircraft's base station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/10/18/europe-closer-to-allowing-in-flight-cellphone-use/ |title=Europe closer to allowing in-flight cellphone use |publisher=Engadget |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they would not attempt connection to the ground base stations as during take off and landing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Simultaneously, airlines may offer phone services to their travelling passengers either as full voice and data services, or initially only as SMS text messaging and similar services. The Australian airline [[Qantas]] is the first airline to run a test aeroplane in this configuration in the autumn of 2007.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] has announced plans to allow limited mobile phone usage on some flights.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} However, in the past, commercial airlines have prevented the use of cell phones and laptops, due to the assertion that the frequencies emitted from these devices may disturb the radio waves contact of the airplane.

On March 20, 2008, an Emirates flight was the first time voice calls have been allowed in-flight on commercial airline flights. The breakthrough came after the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the United Arab Emirates-based General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) granted full approval for the AeroMobile system to be used on Emirates. Passengers were able to make and receive voice calls as well as use text messaging. The system automatically came into operation as the Airbus A340-300 reached cruise altitude. Passengers wanting to use the service received a text message welcoming them to the AeroMobile system when they first switched their phones on.  The approval by EASA has established that GSM phones are safe to use on airplanes, as the AeroMobile system does not require the modification of aircraft components deemed "sensitive," nor does it require the use of modified phones.

In any case, there are inconsistencies between practices allowed by different airlines and even on the same airline in different countries. For example, [[Delta Air Lines]] may allow the use of mobile phones immediately after landing on a domestic flight within the US, whereas they may state "not until the doors are open" on an international flight arriving in the Netherlands. In April 2007 the US [[Federal Communications Commission]] officially prohibited passengers' use of cell phones during a flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fcc-says-no-to-cell-phones-on-planes/|title=FCC Says No To Cell Phones On Planes|last=Clark|first=Amy|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=3 April 2007|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, signs are put up in many countries, such as Canada, the UK and the U.S., at [[petrol stations]] prohibiting the use of mobile phones, due to possible safety issues.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}  However, it is unlikely that mobile phone use can cause any problems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dio.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/54/1/125] Mobile Phones and Service Stations: Rumour, Risk and Precaution, by Adam Burgess (2007) Diogenes 213 54: 1&lt;/ref&gt;  and in fact "petrol station employees have themselves spread the rumour about alleged incidents."

=== Environmental impacts ===

[[Image:Cell phone tower disguised 2008.jpg|thumb|Cellular antenna disguised to look like a tree]]
Like all high structures, cellular antenna masts pose a hazard to low flying aircraft. Towers over a certain height or towers that are close to airports or [[heliports]] are normally required to have [[Aircraft warning lights|warning lights]]. There have been reports that warning lights on cellular masts, TV-towers and other high structures can attract and confuse birds. US authorities estimate that millions of birds are killed near communication towers in the country each year.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cellular antenna towers have been camouflaged to make them less obvious on the horizon, and make them look more like a tree.

An example of the way mobile phones and mobile networks have sometimes been perceived as a threat is the widely reported and later discredited claim that mobile phone masts are associated with the [[Colony Collapse Disorder]] (CCD) which has reduced bee hive numbers by up to 75% in many areas, especially near cities in the US. The Independent newspaper cited a scientific study claiming it provided evidence for the theory that mobile phone masts ''are'' a major cause in the collapse of bee populations, with controlled experiments demonstrating a rapid and catastrophic effect on individual hives near masts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Are mobile phones wiping out our bees? | date=2007-04-15 | work=The Independent | location=UK | url=http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/wildlife/article2449968.ece | first1=Geoffrey | last1=Lean | first2=Harriet | last2=Shawcross | accessdate=2010-05-12 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706154304/http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/wildlife/article2449968.ece | archivedate=July 6, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mobile phones were in fact not covered in the study, and the original researchers have since emphatically disavowed any connection between their research, mobile phones, and CCD, specifically indicating that the Independent article had misinterpreted their results and created "a horror story".&lt;ref&gt;

While the initial claim of damage to bees was widely reported, the corrections to the story were almost non-existent in the media.

There are more than 500 million used mobile phones in the US sitting on shelves or in landfills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press |url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2002/05/52375 |title=Study: Cell Phone Waste Harmful |work=Wired |accessdate=2011-07-11 |date=May 7, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and it is estimated that over 125 million will be discarded this year alone.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}  The problem is growing at a rate of more than two million phones per week, putting tons of toxic waste into landfills daily.  Several companies offer to buy back and recycle mobile phones from users. In the United States many unwanted but working mobile phones are donated to women's shelters to allow emergency communication.

=== Payment methods ===

There are two principal ways to pay for mobile telephony: the [[prepaid mobile phone|'pay-as-you-go']] model where conversation time is purchased and added to a phone unit via an Internet account or in shops or ATMs, or the [[postpaid mobile phone|contract model]] where bills are paid by regular intervals after the service has been consumed.  It is increasingly common for a consumer to purchase a basic package and then bolt-on services and functionality to create a subscription customised to the users needs.

Pay as you go (also known as "pre-pay" or "prepaid") accounts were invented simultaneously in Portugal and Italy and today form more than half of all mobile phone subscriptions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} USA, Canada, Costa Rica, Japan, Israel and Finland are among the rare countries left where most phones are still contract-based.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In the [[history of mobile phones|early days of mobile telephony]], the [[mobile phone operator|operators (carriers)]] charged for all air time consumed by the mobile phone user, which included both outbound and inbound [[telephone call]]s.  As mobile phone adoption rates increased, competition between operators meant that some decided not to charge for incoming calls in some markets (also called "calling party pays").

The European market adopted a calling party pays model throughout the GSM environment and soon various other GSM markets also started to emulate this model.

In Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, and the United States, it is common for the party receiving the call to be charged per minute, although a few carriers are beginning to offer unlimited received phone calls. This is called the "Receiving Party Pays" model.  In China, it was reported that both of its two operators will adopt the caller-pays approach as early as January 2007.&lt;ref name="SCMP"&gt;Amy Gu, "Mainland mobile services to be cheaper", ''South China Morning Post'', December 18, 2006, Page A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

One disadvantage of the receiving party pays systems is that phone owners keep their phones turned off to avoid receiving unwanted calls, which results in the total voice usage rates (and profits) in Calling Party Pays countries outperform those in Receiving Party Pays countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/sti/2538118.pdf OECD.org]&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid the problem of users keeping their phone turned off, most Receiving Party Pays countries have either switched to Calling Party Pays, or their carriers offer additional incentives such as a large number of monthly minutes at a sufficiently discounted rate to compensate for the inconvenience.

Note that when a user [[roaming]] in another country, [[Roaming#Tariffs|international roaming tariffs]] apply to all calls received, regardless of the model adopted in the home country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regulatory-Market/Documents/Publications/Roaming_analysis_final.pdf REGULATORY AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Nana" Technology''' is [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] based technology designed, intended, or that can otherwise be used to improve quality of life for older adults.

==History and usage of the term==

The term “Nana” technology was coined in 2004 by Andrew Carle, an Assistant Professor at [[George Mason University]] in Fairfax, Virginia.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/graphics/nana_tech/flash.htm |title='Nana technology' tools help seniors be independent | work=USA Today | date=August 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carle’s goal was to bridge what he referred to as the 'divide between Geeks and Grans', in which technology companies were failing to consistently develop products of practical value to older adults, with older adults simultaneously unaware of technologies that did exist and could be helpful in their daily lives. Carle additionally felt governments were not paying enough attention to issues relevant to aging populations worldwide – both in stresses on family caregivers struggling to allow aging parents to live independently for as long as possible, as well as on the critical shortage of long term care workers in both home and facility based environments.

[[Image:Nana Tech .Samples.jpg|thumb|alt=A nanatech samples.|240px|Andrew Carle with samples of "Nana" Technology.]]

A word play on the scientific field of [[nanotechnology]], “Nana” technology is loosely directed to imply technologies for someone’s grandmother, or “Nana”.  Carle was the first person to advance the use of this phrase with a formal definition, and one focused exclusively on microchip technologies, with the end result of naming a new and distinct subset of the technology services industry.  Carle’s term and specific application were first nationally published in a feature article in USA TODAY on August 9, 2006. Since that time Carle’s term and/or definition has been published, quoted, or featured in or on numerous media worldwide including but not limited to:  CNN, CNBC, CBS News, Fox News, PBS, NPR, Forbes, Smart Money, BBC, Agence France-Presse, KYODO News Service, and the Australian Broadcast Corporation, among others.

Since defining the sector, Carle has served as a consultant or adviser to a number of companies with an interest in developing technologies for older adults, including APPLE, [[Nintendo]], Vigorous Mind, and GTX Corporation.  With GTX, he helped develop the first GPS shoe for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementia, who may be at risk of wandering and becoming lost.  In 2012, the technology was recognized as one of the "100 Most Important Inventions of Mankind" by the National Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gtxcorp.com/GPS_Shoe_to_be_Featured_in_100_Most_Important_Inventions_of_Mankind_Exhibit&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==

In addition to the term and definition, Carle has established eight categories to date for “Nana” technologies, and as they pertain to areas most relevant to individuals over the age of 65:

'''Health and Wellness:'''  Including technologies such as those for managing medications, monitoring vital signs, or treating medical conditions typically affecting older adults.

'''Safety:''' Including technologies for preventing or reducing falls, monitoring for or requesting emergency assistance, or tracking or preventing wandering among individuals suffering from Alzheimer's related dementia.

'''Cognition:''' Includes technologies intended to improve overall cognitive functioning as affected by normal aging, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), [[Alzheimer's Disease]] or related dementia.
   
'''Communication:''' Includes technologies that allow older adults to communicate electronically via phone, internet, video, or other forms of communication.

'''Sensory:''' Includes technologies that assist older adults affected by reduction or loss of vision, hearing, taste, touch, or smell.

'''Mobility:''' Includes technologies such as those that assist older adults in ambulation, transportation, or driving.

'''Lifestyle:''' Includes technologies that assist older adults in day-to-day functioning including meal preparation, housekeeping/home maintenance, bathing, dressing, etc.
 
'''Robotics/Whole Home Systems:''' Includes technologies that can self perform assistive tasks, and/or which combine two or more of the above categories into a single system.

==Examples of Current "Nana" Technologies==

Carle has released or presented multiple Top "Nana" Technologies opinion lists, which have been published in numerous national and international media.  Featured below is a sample of technologies mentioned or similar to those identified during a presentation at the [[AARP]] Life@50+ National Event &amp; Expo in [[Washington, DC]]:

;GPS SmartSole: [http://www.gpssmartsole.com] For individuals with Alzheimer's who may wander and become lost.  A shoe insole that includes GPS location technology.  Additionally includes the ability to program a safety "geozone", outside of which authorized caregivers will receive email or text alerts providing satellite map location of the wearer.

;Philips Medication Dispensing System: [http://www.managemypills.com/content]  A “bubble gum” style table top dispenser that releases pills at pre-programmed times, while providing audio and visual reminders. If pills are not taken within a designated time, the machine automatically telephones up to five family members, friends, or a professional call center to report the missed dosage.

;Jitterbug Cell Phone: [http://www.greatcall.com] Designed with simple to see and use features, including oversized buttons, increased screen size and brightness, and a cushioned ear rest.

;GrandCare Systems: [https://www.grandcare.com]  A sensor based system the remotely monitors motion and related activity in the home, providing alerts for activity detected as unusual or dangerous.  The system additionally provides tele-health and communication capabilities.

==Future Technologies==
Carle has repeatedly referenced “Nana” Technologies being researched or developed for future application.  Examples cited by Carle have included a medicine cabinet featuring both face recognition and voice communication capabilities, a “smart shirt” that can monitor vital signs and administer CPR in the event of an emergency, "sensory" shoe inserts that can provide older adults with the same balance as a 20-year-old, and a personal assistance robot that can hear, see, and smell.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:GPSShoe.jpg|thumb|alt=A gpsshoe.|GPS Shoe Schematic.]] --&gt;

==Trademark and Copyright==
The trade name "Nana" Technology is [[trademark]]ed to Carle and used commercially, among other uses, as a licensed designation for "best of show" winners of an annual, national competition of technologies for older adults.  No company or person may use the "Nana" Technology designation in commercial use for their products and/or personal gain without permission or licensure of such use from Andrew Carle.

Intellectual property rights for the "Nana" Technology term, definition, and categories are additionally copyrighted to Carle (2004), as originally published and presented in his course lectures at [[George Mason University]], and in subsequent articles published by Carle.  In this regard, use of the term to describe such technologies must be properly sourced, as well as meet the definition and categories established by Carle.

'''''Ocean Ranger''''' was a [[semi-submersible]] mobile [[oil platform|offshore drilling unit]] that sank in Canadian waters on 15 February 1982. It was drilling an exploration well on the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]], {{convert|267|km}} east of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]], for [[Mobil|Mobil Oil of Canada, Ltd.]] (MOCAN) with 84 crew members on board when it sank. There were no survivors.

==History and design==
''Ocean Ranger'' was designed and owned by [[ODECO|Ocean Drilling and Exploration Company, Inc. (ODECO)]] of [[New Orleans]]. The vessel was a self-propelled large semi-submersible design with a drilling facility and living quarters. It was capable of operation beneath {{convert|1500|ft}} of ocean water and could drill to a maximum depth of {{convert|25000|ft}}. It was described by ODECO as the world's largest semi-submersible oil rig to date.&lt;ref name=NYTFeb161982&gt;{{Cite news |title=84 Feared Dead as Oil Drilling Rig Reportedly Sinks in North Atlantic |author= |agency=AP |newspaper=The New York Times |date=16 February 1982 |page= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/16/world/84-feared-dead-as-oil-drilling-rig-reportedly-sinks-in-north-atlantic.html?scp=7&amp;sq=sinks%20in%20Atlantic&amp;st=cse |accessdate=9 May 2011 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructed for ODECO in 1976 by [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] in [[Hiroshima]], Japan, ''Ocean Ranger'' was {{convert|396|ft}} long, {{convert|262|ft}} wide, and {{convert|337|ft}} high. It had twelve {{convert|45000|lb|adj=on}} anchors.&lt;ref name=time&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The weight was 25,000 tons. It was floating on two {{convert|122|m|ft|adj=on}} long pontoons that rested {{convert|24|m|ft}} below the surface.&lt;ref name=cbc2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The vessel was approved for 'unrestricted ocean operations' and designed to withstand extremely harsh conditions at sea, including {{convert|100|kn|km/h|adj=on}} winds and {{convert|110|ft|0|adj=on}} waves. Prior to moving to the [[Grand Banks]] area in November 1980, it had operated off the coasts of [[Alaska]], [[New Jersey]] and Ireland.

==Sinking==
On 26 November 1981, ''Ocean Ranger'' commenced drilling well J-34, its third well in the [[Hibernia (oil field)|Hibernia Oil Field]]. ''Ocean Ranger'' was still working on this well in February 1982 when the incident occurred. Two other [[semi-submersible]] platforms were also drilling nearby: ''Sedco 706'', {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} NNE, and [[Zapata Corporation|''Zapata'']] ''Ugland'', {{convert|19.2|mi|km}} N of ''Ocean Ranger''. On 14 February 1982, the platforms received reports of an approaching storm linked to a major [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] cyclone from NORDCO Ltd, the company responsible for issuing offshore weather forecasts. The usual method of preparing for bad weather involved hanging-off the drillpipe at the sub-sea [[wellhead]] and disconnecting the [[Marine riser tensioner|riser]] from the sub-sea [[blowout preventer]]. Due to surface difficulties and the speed at which the storm developed, the crew of ''Ocean Ranger'' were forced to shear the drillpipe after hanging-off, after which they disconnected the riser in the early evening.

At about 19:00 local time, the nearby ''Sedco 706'' experienced a large [[Rogue wave (oceanography)|rogue wave]] which damaged some items on deck and caused the loss of a life raft. Soon after, radio transmissions were heard from ''Ocean Ranger'', describing a broken portlight (a [[porthole]] window) and water in the ballast control room, with discussions on how best to repair the damage. ''Ocean Ranger'' reported experiencing storm seas of {{convert|55|ft|m}}, with the odd wave up to {{convert|65|ft|m}}, thus leaving the unprotected portlight at {{convert|28|ft|m}} above the water line vulnerable to wave damage. Some time after 21:00, radio conversations originating on ''Ocean Ranger'' were heard on ''Sedco 706'' and ''Zapata Ugland'', noting that valves on ''Ocean Ranger'''s ballast control panel appeared to be opening and closing of their own accord. The radio conversations also discussed the {{convert|100|kn|km/h|adj=on}} winds and waves up to {{convert|65|ft|m}} high. Through the remainder of the evening, routine radio traffic passed between ''Ocean Ranger'', its neighbouring rigs and their individual support boats. Nothing out of the ordinary was noted.

At 00:52 local time, on 15 February, a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]] call was sent out from ''Ocean Ranger'', noting a severe list to the port side of the rig and requesting immediate assistance. This was the first communication from ''Ocean Ranger'' identifying a major problem. The standby vessel, the M/V ''Seaforth Highlander'', was requested to come in close as countermeasures against the 10–15-degree list were proving ineffective. The onshore MOCAN supervisor was notified of the situation, and the [[Canadian Forces]] and Mobil-operated helicopters were alerted just after 1:00 local time. The M/V ''Boltentor'' and the M/V ''Nordertor'', the standby boats of ''Sedco 706'' and ''Zapata Ugland'' respectively, were also dispatched to ''Ocean Ranger'' to provide assistance. At 1:30 local time, ''Ocean Ranger'' transmitted its last message: "There will be no further radio communications from ''Ocean Ranger''. We are going to lifeboat stations." Shortly thereafter, in the middle of the night and in the midst of severe winter weather, the crew abandoned the platform. The platform remained afloat for another ninety minutes, sinking between 3:07 and 3:13 local time.

All of ''Ocean Ranger'' sank beneath the Atlantic: by the next morning all that remained was a few buoys. Her entire complement of 84 workers – 46 Mobil employees and 38 contractors from various service companies – were killed.&lt;ref name=NYTGiniger&gt;{{Cite news |title=Hope Fades For 84 on Rig |author=Giniger, Henry |newspaper=The New York Times |date=17 February 1982 |page= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/17/world/hope-fades-for-84-on-rig-18-on-soviet-freighter-die.html?scp=9&amp;sq=ocean%20ranger&amp;st=cse |accessdate=9 May 2011 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the rig was provided with an Emergency Procedures Manual which detailed evacuation procedures, it is unclear how effectively the platform evacuation was carried out. There is evidence that at least one lifeboat was successfully launched with up to 36 crew inside, and witnesses on the M/V ''Seaforth Highlander'' reported seeing at least 20 crew members in the water at the same time, indicating that at least 56 crew successfully evacuated the rig.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The [[United States Coast Guard]] report speculated that 'these men either chose to enter the water directly or were thrown into the water as a result of unsuccessful lifesaving equipment launching'. Rescue attempts by the standby vessels were hampered by the adverse weather conditions and the conclusion that the standby boats were neither equipped nor configured to rescue casualties from a cold sea. As a result of the severe weather, the first helicopter did not arrive on scene until 2:30 local time, by which time most if not all of ''Ocean Ranger'''s crew had succumbed to [[hypothermia]] and drowned. Over the next week, 22 bodies were recovered from the North Atlantic. Autopsies indicated that those men had died as a result of drowning while in a hypothermic state.

In related activity the following day, the Soviet [[container ship]] ''Mekhanik Tarasov'' was struck by the same weather conditions as ''Ocean Ranger'', approximately sixty-five miles to the east. The battered Soviet freighter listed dramatically for hours before sinking with the loss of 32 of 37 crew.&lt;ref name=NYTGiniger/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Soviet Ship in Trouble Off the Canadian Coast |author= |agency=AP |newspaper=The New York Times |date=16 February 1982 |location= |page= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/16/world/soviet-ship-in-trouble-off-the-canadian-coast.html?scp=2&amp;sq=%22Ocean%20Ranger%22%20+Soviet%20freighter&amp;st=cse |accessdate=10 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Last-minute fight for survival |agency=Canadian Press |newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen |date=22 February 1982 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X9EyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yO4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2236%2C60895 |accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes and effects==

[[Image:Ranger2.png|thumb|400px|''Ocean Ranger's'' vulnerability to a [[rogue wave]] illustrated.&lt;br /&gt;1 – For comparison, the [[Draupner wave]] 59 ft/18 m&lt;br /&gt;2 – 28 ft/8.5 m&lt;br /&gt; 3 – Location of the ballast control room]]

The remains of the platform were found by sonar search over the following weeks, resting in an inverted position approximately {{convert|485|ft|m}} south-east of the wellhead, surrounded by major items of debris such as the derrick. The platform had capsized bow-first, turning over and striking the sea floor with the forward ends of the platform's pontoons. The [[United States Coast Guard]] Marine Board of Investigation report on the disaster summarised the chain of events as follows:&lt;ref&gt;United States Coast Guard: Marine Board of Investigation (1983) "Marine Casualty Report:  Mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) Ocean Ranger, O.N. 615641, capsizing and sinking in the Atlantic Ocean on 15 February 1982 with multiple loss of life"  Washington, D.C., U.S.A.:  U.S. Coast Guard.  Available at: [https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/DCO%20Documents/5p/CG-5PC/INV/docs/boards/oceanranger.pdf U.S. Coast Guard: Ocean Ranger]&lt;/ref&gt;
*A large wave appeared to cause a broken portlight;
*The broken portlight allowed the ingress of sea water into the ballast control room;
*The ballast control panel malfunctioned or appeared to malfunction to the crew;
*As a result of this malfunction or perceived malfunction, several valves in the platform's ballast control system opened due to a short-circuit, or were manually opened by the crew;
*''Ocean Ranger'' assumed a forward list;
*As a result of the forward list, boarding seas began flooding the forward chain lockers located in the forward corner support columns;
*The forward list worsened;
*The pumping of the forward tanks was not possible using the usual ballast control method as the magnitude of the forward list created a vertical distance between the forward tanks and the ballast pumps located astern that exceeded the suction available on the ballast system's pumps;
*Detailed instructions and personnel trained in the use of the ballast control panel were not available;
*At some point, the crew blindly attempted to manually operate the ballast control panel using brass control rods;
*At some point, the manually operated sea valves in both pontoons were closed;
*Progressive flooding of the chain lockers and subsequent flooding of the upper deck resulted in a loss of buoyancy great enough to cause the platform to capsize.

A Canadian Royal Commission spent two years looking into the disaster. The joint Federal-Provincial Royal Commission on the Ocean Ranger Marine Disaster&lt;ref&gt;Royal Commission on the Ocean Ranger Marine Disaster (Canada) (1984) "Report One: The Loss of the Semisubmersible Drill Rig ''Ocean Ranger'' and its Crew" Ottawa, Ontario, Canada:  Canadian Government Publishing Centre.

The Royal Commission concluded that ''Ocean Ranger'' had design and construction flaws, particularly in the ballast control room, and that the crew lacked proper safety training, [[survival suit]]s and equipment. The Royal Commission also concluded that inspection and regulation by United States and Canadian government agencies was ineffective. In addition to key recommendations for Canada's offshore oil and gas industry, the commission recommended that the federal government invest annually in research and development for search and rescue technologies, such as improving the design of lifesaving equipment—a commitment that has been met in every fiscal year since 1982. {{Further|National Search and Rescue Program}}

==Aftermath==
In August 1983, the wreck of ''Ocean Ranger'' was refloated and sunk in deeper waters by the Dutch firm Wijsmuller Salvage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejot.net/site/?page_id=837&amp;show_article_preview=356&amp;jot...356&amp;jot_download_article=356 |title=Safety makes all the difference |website=Thejot.net |accessdate=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its sinking the previous year, concerns over the wreck's position had been made by the federal government. As the Ocean Ranger was situated at an approximate 30 metres below the water, the wreck posed a danger to shipping. The operation saw ''Ocean Ranger'' towed upside down with her two pontoons breaking the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1606937561 |title=Ocean Ranger wreck towed to deeper water - CBC Player |website=Cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operations had commenced earlier in June, however progress was halted when two salvage divers were killed on the wreck by an underwater explosion on 20 June. A stop-work order on refloating the wreck was declared and an investigation into the incident followed. However, exploratory diving was allowed to continue. A second incident on 26 June saw a third diver killed, believed to have been hit by a dropped object as he attempted to return to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thediversassociation.com/index.php?/incidents/&amp;page=13 |title=Incidents |publisher=Divers Association |date= |accessdate=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/06/20/An-underwater-explosion-Monday-killed-two-divers-working-at/8233424929600/ |title=An underwater explosion Monday killed two divers working at... - UPI Archives |website=Upi.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/business/2010/6/30/husky-s-undersea-repair-plans-irk-divers-1439241.html |title=Husky's undersea repair plans irk divers |website=Thetelegram.com |date=2007-06-18 |accessdate=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/06/28/Canadian-News-Briefs/2498425620800/ |title=Canadian News Briefs - UPI Archives |website=Upi.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawsuits arising from the sinking were settled out of court with a package cumulatively valued at $20 million.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news | title=25 years later, Ocean Ranger Tragedy deeply felt |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2007/02/15/ranger-25.html | work=CBC News | date=15 February 2007 | accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, a non-fiction book, ''The Ocean Ranger: Remaking the Promise of Oil'' was published in Canada by [[Fernwood Publishing]]. The book's author, Susan Dodd, lost her older brother Jim with the sinking of the ''Ocean Ranger'' and watched, for years, as her parents pursued legal struggles with the oil companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fernwoodpublishing.ca/The-Ocean-Ranger/ |title=The Ocean Ranger: Remaking the Promise of Oil |author=Dodd, Susan |year=2012 |publisher=Fernwood Publishing |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Casualties==

[[Ian "Scotty" Morrison]], former director of [[NHL]] officiating and a trustee of the [[Stanley Cup]] and [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] inductee, lost his son Perry. Perry worked as a deep-sea diver on the rig. His body was not recovered.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/scotty-morrison-feels-gaineys-pain/article1111503/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Plus''''' is [[Joseph McElroy]]'s fifth novel.  Set in some unspecified future, it tells the story of Imp Plus, a disembodied brain controlling IMP, the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform, in earth orbit.  The novel consists of Imp Plus's thoughts as he tries to comprehend his limited existence, while struggling with language, limited memories, and communicating with Ground Control.  The plot is driven by Imp Plus's recall of fragments of his past and of language, his improving comprehension of his present, all while his medical condition gradually deteriorates.

McElroy denies that the novel is [[science fiction]], unless "science" is used in its etymological sense of "knowing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=LeClair|editor1-first=Tom|editor2-last=McCaffery|editor2-first=Larry|chapter=Joseph McElroy|title=Anything Can Happen|year=1983|publisher=University of Illinois Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel was reprinted as an e-book by [[Dzanc Books]] in 2014, with an introductory 2012 poem "A Green of its Own Breathing" by Sarah Grindley, dedicated to "Joe McElroy &amp; Imp Plus".

[[Image:polespear.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Polespear under tension with a cluster head attached.]]

A '''polespear''' ('''hand spear''' or '''gidgee''') is an underwater tool used in [[spearfishing]], consisting of a pole, a [[spear]] tip, and a [[rubber]] loop. Polespears are often mistakenly called [[Hawaiian sling]]s, but the tools differ. A Hawaiian sling is akin to a slingshot or an underwater [[bow and arrow]], since the spear and the propelling device are separate, while a polespear has the sling (rubber loop) attached to the spear.

==Description==
The pole is usually between four feet and ten feet long and made of [[fiberglass]], [[carbon fibre]], [[aluminum]], [[graphite]], or [[wood]]. Longer versions often break down into two or more pieces that screw together. The tip is either threaded to accept different kinds of spear tips or already has a fixed tip attached. The most popular spear tip on polespears are the paralyzer (often called a three-prong), and the Tahitian shaft (a single pivoting barb). Some more serious hunters will equip the polespear with a slip-tip (tip removes from the end and tethers to a fixed point). At the butt end of the spear is an elastic loop, usually made of surgical tubing or a band of rubber (a [[bicycle]] [[inner tube]], for example).

The spear is operated by placing the rubber loop in the crook of the thumb, then reaching up the spear shaft to stretch the elastic band and grabbing the polespear to hold the band in tension. On flimsy spears, it's useful to twist the spear as the band stretches to keep the spear from bending. Shooting the spear involves releasing the grasp of the hand but still using the hand to guide the spear like a barrel to a gun. The firing distance of a polespear can be divided into two ranges. First, there is the overall distance of the stretch or the 'travel range'. This second range is the distance that most are interested in as it is more relevant to penetrating fish. For this reason, it is called the 'penetrating range.' Not all the travel of the spear being fired has the 'punch' to penetrate through fish. Depending on the polespear's attributes such as mass, drag, band strength, band stretch, etc., the penetrating range can be from a scant few inches to several feet. Other factors may include fish orientation, fish width, density, skin composition, etc. One would need to take all the attributes into account before firing a polespear towards a target. For example, the band pull on a 10-foot polespear may stretch up to 6-feet of the polespear. It actually requires about 8-feet of polespear, measured from the rear, to do this because the stretch doesn't start till the band begins to provide tension (typically, about 2-feet loop length on a 10-footer). However, the penetrating range may only be half of the pull. This equals about 3' for a 10 footer. Some fish, however, are thicker/denser and may require much closer shots.

The more mass a polespear contains, the more band power it will require to move the same speed as a polespear with less mass. However, some fiberglass or extremely lightweight polespears will have so little mass that there is little velocity or 'punch' behind them when it hits a fish.

A hybrid polespear combines aluminum with a more flexible material such as a fiberglass rod. These polespears offer rigidity for loading, but still some flexibility in the front end to absorb the lateral movements of a fish once it is attached to the end.

In [[computer architecture]], a '''processor register''' is a quickly accessible location available to a computer's [[central processing unit]] (CPU). Registers usually consist of a small amount of fast [[Computer storage|storage]], although some registers have specific hardware functions, and may be read-only or write-only. Registers are typically addressed by mechanisms other than [[main memory]], but may in some cases be assigned a [[memory address]] e.g. [[DEC PDP-10]], [[ICT 1900]].

Almost all computers, whether [[load/store architecture]] or not, load data from a larger memory into registers where it is used for arithmetic operations and is manipulated or tested by [[machine instruction]]s. Manipulated data is then often stored back to main memory, either by the same instruction or by a subsequent one. Modern processors use either [[Static random-access memory|static]] or [[Dynamic random-access memory|dynamic]] [[Random-access memory|RAM]] as main memory, with the latter usually accessed via one or more [[CPU cache#Multi-level caches|cache levels]].

Processor registers are normally at the top of the [[memory hierarchy]], and provide the fastest way to access data. The term normally refers only to the group of registers that are directly encoded as part of an instruction, as defined by the [[instruction set]]. However, modern high-performance CPUs often have duplicates of these "architectural registers" in order to improve performance via [[register renaming]], allowing parallel and [[speculative execution]]. Modern [[x86]] design acquired these techniques around 1995 with the releases of [[Pentium Pro]], [[Cyrix 6x86]], [[Nx586]], and [[AMD K5]].

A common property of [[computer program]]s is [[locality of reference]], which refers to accessing the same values repeatedly and holding frequently used values in registers to improve performance; this makes fast registers and caches meaningful.&lt;ref name="surveyCPURF"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Survey of Techniques for Designing and Managing CPU Register File|journal=Concurrency and Computation|doi=10.1002/cpe.3906|publisher=Wiley|date=2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allocating frequently used variables to registers can be critical to a program's performance; this [[register allocation]] is performed either by a [[compiler]] in the [[Code generation (compiler)|code generation]] phase, or manually by an [[assembly language]] programmer.

== {{Anchor|RS}}Register size ==
Registers are normally measured by the number of bits they can hold, for example, an "[[8-bit]] register", "[[32-bit]] register" or a "[[64-bit computing|64-bit]] register" or even more. In some instruction sets, the registers can operate in various modes breaking down its storage memory into smaller ones (32-bit into four 8-bit one for instance) to which multiple data (vector, or [[Array data structure|one dimensional array of data]]) can be loaded and operated upon at the same time. Typically it is implemented by adding extra registers that map their memory into bigger one.  Processors that have the ability to execute single instruction on multiple data are called [[vector processor]]s.

=={{Anchor|GPR}}Types of registers==

&lt;!-- TODO - glossary format?  term / defn templates? --&gt;

A processor often contains several kinds of registers, which can be classified according to their content or instructions that operate on them:

* ''User-accessible registers'' can be read or written by machine instructions. The most common division of user-accessible registers is into data registers and address registers.
** ''{{vanchor|Data register}}s'' can hold [[Data (computing)|numeric data value]]s such as [[integer (computer science)|integer]] and, in some architectures, floating-point values, as well as [[character (computing)|characters]], small [[bit array]]s and other data. In some older&lt;!-- than which? --&gt; and low end CPUs, a special data register, known as the [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]], is used implicitly for many operations.
** ''{{vanchor|Address register}}s'' hold [[Memory address|addresses]] and are used by instructions that indirectly access [[primary memory]].
*** Some processors contain registers that may only be used to hold an address or only to hold numeric values (in some cases used as an [[index register]] whose value is added as an offset from some address); others allow registers to hold either kind of quantity.  A wide variety of possible [[addressing mode]]s, used to specify the effective address of an operand, exist.
*** The [[stack pointer]] is used to manage the [[run-time stack]]. Rarely, other [[stack (data structure)|data stacks]] are addressed by dedicated address registers, see [[stack machine]].
** ''General-purpose registers'' (''GPR''s) can store both data and addresses, i.e., they are combined data/address registers and rarely the [[register file]] is ''unified'' to include floating point as well.
** ''[[Status register]]s'' hold [[truth value]]s often used to determine whether some instruction should or should not be executed.
** ''{{vanchor|Floating-point register|FLOATING_POINT_REGISTER|floating point register}}s'' (''FPR''s)  store [[floating point number]]s in many architectures.
** ''[[Constant (computer programming)|Constant]] registers'' hold read-only values such as zero, one, or [[pi]].
** ''{{visible anchor|Vector registers}}'' hold data for [[vector processor|vector processing]] done by [[SIMD]] instructions (Single Instruction, Multiple Data).
** ''Special-purpose registers'' (''SPR''s) hold program state; they usually include the [[program counter]], also called the instruction pointer, and the [[status register]]; the program counter and status register might be combined in a [[program status word]] (PSW) register. The aforementioned stack pointer is sometimes also included in this group. Embedded microprocessors can also have registers corresponding to specialized hardware elements.
** In some architectures, ''model-specific registers'' (also called ''machine-specific registers'') store data and settings related to the processor itself. Because their meanings are attached to the design of a specific processor, they cannot be expected to remain standard between processor generations.
** ''[[Memory Type Range Registers]]'' (''MTRR''s)
* ''Internal registers'' – registers not accessible by instructions, used internally for processor operations.
** ''[[Instruction register]]'', holding the instruction currently being executed.
** Registers related to fetching information from [[random access memory|RAM]], a collection of storage registers located on separate chips from the CPU:
*** ''[[Memory buffer register]]'' (''MBR'')
*** ''[[Memory data register]]'' (''MDR'')
*** ''[[Memory address register]]'' (''MAR'')
* ''Architectural register''{{anchor|ARCHITECTURAL}} - The registers visible to software defined by an architecture may not correspond to the physical hardware, if there is [[register renaming]] being performed by underlying hardware.

[[Hardware register]]s are similar, but occur outside CPUs.

In some architectures (such as [[SPARC]] and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]]), the first or last register in the integer [[register file]] is a pseudo-register in a way that it is hardwired to always return zero when read (mostly to simplify indexing modes), and it cannot be overwritten. In [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] this is also done for the floating-point register file. As a result of this, register files are commonly quoted as having one register more than how many of them are actually usable; for example, 32 registers are quoted when only 31 of them fit within the above definition of a register.

==Examples==
The following table shows the number of registers in several mainstream CPU architectures.  Note that in x86-compatible processors the stack pointer (&lt;tt&gt;ESP&lt;/tt&gt;) is counted as an integer register, even though there are a limited number of instructions that may be used to operate on its contents.  Similar caveats apply to most architectures.

Although all of the above listed architectures are different, almost all are a basic arrangement known as the [[Von Neumann architecture]], first proposed by the Hungarian-American [[mathematician]] [[John von Neumann]]. It is also noteworthy that the number of registers on [[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPUs]] is much higher than that on CPUs.&lt;ref name="surveyCPURF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Register usage==
The number of registers available on a processor and the operations that can be performed using those registers has a significant impact on the [[algorithmic efficiency|efficiency]] of code generated by [[optimizing compilers]]. The [[Strahler number]] of an expression tree gives the minimum number of registers required to evaluate that expression tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5533">'''Reverse electrodialysis''' ('''RED''') is the [[salinity gradient]] energy retrieved from the difference in the salt [[concentration]] between [[seawater]] and [[Fresh water|river water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980OcEng...7....1L 1980 - energy by reverse electrodialysis]&lt;/ref&gt; A method of utilizing the energy produced by this process by means of a heat engine was invented by Prof. [[Sidney Loeb]] in 1977 at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.
[http://www.google.com/patents/US4171409 --United States Patent US4171409]

In reverse [[electrodialysis]] a salt solution and fresh water are let through a stack of alternating cation and anion exchange membranes. The chemical potential difference between salt and fresh water generates a voltage over each membrane and the total potential of the system is the sum of the potential differences over all membranes. The process works through difference in ion concentration instead of an electric field, which has implications for the type of membrane needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtg.tnw.utwente.nl/teaching/assign/blue/ See note 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927220919/http://mtg.tnw.utwente.nl/teaching/assign/blue/ |date=2008-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In RED, as in a [[fuel cell]], the cells are stacked. A module with a capacity of 250&amp;nbsp;kW has the size of a shipping container.

In the [[Netherlands]], for example, more than 3,300 m³ fresh water runs into the sea per second on average. The membrane halves the pressure differences which results in a water column of approximately 135&amp;nbsp;meters. The energy potential is therefore e=[[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|mg&amp;Delta;h]]=3.3*10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg/s*10&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;*135&amp;nbsp;meters ca.= 4.5*10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Joule]] per second, Power=4.5 gigawatts.
&lt;!--
These numbers do not work out correctly: see Talk. Theoretically the output is 2.5 MJ or 0.5 kWh/m³. This corresponds to about 3,000 MW, which is about one-third of the national electricity consumption ([[2005]]).

"14*3300 bars m^3/sec" yields 4.6 GW (type it into a Google search box) so the numbers work out okay.~~~

==Development==
In 2006 a 50&amp;nbsp;kW plant was located at a coastal test site in [[Harlingen, Netherlands|Harlingen]], the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardo-energy.org/drupal/book/export/html/2243 Blue energy]&lt;/ref&gt; the focus being on prevention of [[biofouling]] of the [[anode]], [[cathode]], and membranes and increasing the membrane performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tbk.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2008/JMembrSciVeerman/2008JMembrSciVeerman.pdf electrodialysis stacks by a validated model]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netserver2.net/waterforum/index.asp?url=/template_a1.asp&amp;que=paginanr=3716 Friese wereldprimeur met stroomproductie uit zoet-zout water]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Directorate for Public Works and Water Management, Redstack, and ENECO signed a declaration of intent for development of a pilot plant on the [[Afsluitdijk]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporateuk.eneco.nl/pages/default.asp?PageID=60&amp;Mainmenu=News%20and%20media&amp;MainmenuID=45&amp;Mainmenusub=Press%20releases&amp;MainmenusubID=60&amp;ShowNieuws=13424&amp;ModuleitemID=424 Electricity from fresh and salt water]&lt;/ref&gt; The plant was put into service on 26 November 2014 and produces 50 kW of electricity to show the technical feasibility in real-life conditions using fresh IJsselmeer water and salt water from the Wadden Sea. Theoretically, with 1m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s river water and an equal amount of sea water, approximately 1 MW of renewable electricity can be recovered at this location by upscaling the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch King opens world's first RED power plant driven on fresh-salt water mixing|url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/12388-dutch-king-opens-world-s-first-red-power-plant-driven-on-fresh-salt-water-mixing.html|publisher=Dutch Water Sector|accessdate=4 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416092205/http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/12388-dutch-king-opens-world-s-first-red-power-plant-driven-on-fresh-salt-water-mixing.html|archivedate=16 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be expected that after this phase the installation could be further expanded to a final capacity of 200 MW.

'''Software-defined data center''' ('''SDDC'''; also: virtual data center, VDC) is a marketing term that extends [[virtualization]] concepts such as abstraction, pooling, and automation to all [[data center]] resources and services to achieve [[IT as a service]] (ITaaS).&lt;ref name="Softchoice Advisor"&gt;
{{cite web|last=Davidson|first=Emily A.|title=The Software-Defined-Data-Center (SDDC): Concept Or Reality? [VMware]|url=http://blogs.softchoice.com/advisor/ssn/the-software-defined-data-center-sddc-concept-or-reality-vmware/|work=Softchoice Advisor Article|publisher=Softchoice Advisor|accessdate=28 June 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In a software-defined data center, "all elements of the infrastructure — networking, storage, CPU and security – are virtualized and delivered as a service."&lt;ref name="TechTarget"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition: Software Defined Datacenter|last=Rouse|first=Margaret|url=http://searchsdn.techtarget.com/definition/software-defined-data-center-SDDC|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While ITaaS may represent an outcome of SDDC, SDDC is differently cast{{by whom|date=April 2014}} toward integrators and datacenter builders rather than toward tenants.  Software awareness in the infrastructure is not visible to tenants.

SDDC support can be claimed by a wide variety of approaches.  Critics see the software-defined data center as a marketing tool and "software-defined hype," noting this variability.&lt;ref name="CRN May 2013"&gt;
{{cite news|last=Kovar|first=Joseph F.

|accessdate=10 February 2014|newspaper=CRN|date=13 May 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an analyst{{which|date=April 2014}} projected that at least some software-defined data center components would experience market growth. The [[software-defined networking]] market is expected to be valued at about USD $3.7 billion by 2016, compared to USD $360 million in 2013.&lt;ref name="CRN May 2013" /&gt; [[International Data Corporation|IDC]] estimates that the [[software-defined storage]] market is poised to expand faster than any other storage market.&lt;ref name="CRN May 2013" /&gt;

==Description and core components==
The software-defined data center encompasses a variety of concepts and data-center infrastructure components, with each component potentially [[provisioning|provision]]ed, operated, and managed through an [[application programming interface]] (API).&lt;ref name="All Things D June 2013"&gt;

A software-defined data center differs from a [[private cloud]], since a private cloud only has to offer [[virtual machine|virtual-machine]] self-service,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} beneath which it could use traditional provisioning and management. Instead, SDDC concepts imagine a data center that can encompass private, public, and hybrid clouds.&lt;ref name=WindowsITPro&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and development==
Data centers traditionally lacked the capacity to accommodate total virtualization.&lt;ref name="InfoWorld August 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Knorr|first=Eric|title=What the software-defined data center really means|url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/data-center/what-the-software-defined-data-center-really-means-199930|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=InfoWorld|date=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, companies began laying the foundation for software-defined data centers with virtualization.&lt;ref name="CRN May 2013" /&gt; Ben Cherian of Midokura considered [[Amazon Web Services]] as a catalyst for the move toward software-defined data centers because it "convinced the world that the data center could be abstracted into much smaller units and could be treated as disposable pieces of technology, which in turn could be priced as a utility."&lt;ref name="All Things D June 2013" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Potential impact==
In 2013,  the software-defined data center term was promoted as a paradigm shift.&lt;ref name="All Things D June 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="landscape"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.datamation.com/data-center/software-defined-data-centers-could-change-the-it-landscape-1.html |title= Software-Defined Data Centers Could Change the IT Landscape |date= 25 July 2013 |work= Datamation |author= Paul Shread |accessdate= 22 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Steve Herrod, the promise of the software-defined data center was that companies would no longer need to rely on specialized hardware or hire consultants to install and program hardware in its specialized language.&lt;ref name="VMware blog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Herrod|first=Steve|title=Interop and the Software-Defined Datacenter|url=http://cto.vmware.com/interop-and-the-software-defined-datacenter/|work=VMware blog post|publisher=VMware|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, IT would define applications and all of the resources they require—including compute, storage, networking, security, and availability—and group all of the required components to create a “logical application.”&lt;ref name="VMware blog" /&gt;

Commonly cited benefits of software-defined data centers include improved efficiency&lt;ref name=SearchDataCenter&gt;{{cite web|last=Earls|first=Alan|title=Is the software-defined data center ready for the mainstream?|url=http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/tip/Is-the-software-defined-data-center-ready-for-the-mainstream|work=SearchDataCenter article|publisher=SearchDataCenter|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from extending virtualization throughout the data center; increased agility&lt;ref name=ComputerWeekly.com&gt;{{cite web|last=Venkatraman|first=Archana|title=Software-defined datacentres demystified|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Software-defined-datacentres-demystified|work=ComputerWeekly.com|publisher=ComputerWeekly.com|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from provisioning applications quickly; improved control&lt;ref name=ComputerWeekly.com /&gt; over application availability and security through policy-based governance; and the flexibility&lt;ref name=SearchDataCenter /&gt;&lt;ref name=ComputerWeekly.com /&gt; to run new and existing applications in multiple platforms and clouds.

In addition, a software-defined data center implementation could reduce a company’s energy usage by enabling servers and other data center hardware to run at decreased power levels or be turned off.&lt;ref name=ComputerWeekly.com /&gt; Some believe that software-defined data centers improve security by giving organizations more control over their hosted data and security levels, compared to security provided by hosted-cloud providers.&lt;ref name=ComputerWeekly.com /&gt;

The software-defined data center was marketed to drive down prices for data center hardware and challenge traditional hardware vendors to develop new ways to differentiate their products through software and services.&lt;ref name="Wired Pete Manca"&gt;{{cite news|last=Manca|first=Pete|title=Software-Defined Data Centers: What’s the Buzz All About?|url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2013/05/software-defined-data-centers-whats-the-buzz-all-about/|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=Wired|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
The concepts of software-defined in general, and software-defined data centers in particular, have been dismissed by some as “nonsense,” “[[marketecture]],”  and “software-defined hype.”&lt;ref name="CRN May 2013" /&gt; Some critics believe that only a minority of companies with “completely homogeneous IT systems’” already in place, such as [[Yahoo!]] and [[Google]], can transition to software-defined data centers.&lt;ref name="CRN May 2013" /&gt;

According to some observers, software-defined data centers won’t necessarily eliminate challenges that relate to handling the differences between development and production environments; managing a mix of legacy and new applications; or delivering [[service-level agreement]]s (SLAs).&lt;ref name="CRN May 2013" /&gt;

Software-defined networking was seen as essential to the software-defined data center, but it is also considered to be the “least mature technology” required to enable the software-defined data center.&lt;ref name="InfoWorld August 2012" /&gt; However, several companies, including [[Arista Networks]], [[Cisco]], [[Microsoft]] and [[VMware]], market products to enable virtual networks that are provisioned, extended, and moved across existing physical networks.&lt;ref name="InfoWorld August 2012" /&gt;

Several competing network virtualization standards already existed by 2012.&lt;ref name="InfoWorld August 2012" /&gt; Neutron, the networking component of the [[open-source software]] [[OpenStack]] project, provides an application-level abstraction of network resources and includes an interface for configuring virtual switches.&lt;ref name="InfoWorld August 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Neutron’s developer documentation |url= http://docs.openstack.org/developer/neutron/ |publisher= OpenStack |accessdate= 22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software-defined data center approach will force IT organizations to adapt. Software-defined environments require rethinking many IT processes—including automation, metering, and billing—and executing service delivery, service activation, and service assurance.&lt;ref name=ComputerWeekly.com /&gt;
A widespread transition to the SDDC could take years.&lt;ref name="EMA Volk blog post" /&gt;

The '''SpaceX reusable launch system development program''' is a [[private spaceflight|privately funded]] program to develop a set of new technologies for an [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital]] [[spacecraft|launch system]] that may be [[reusable launch vehicle|reused]] many times in a manner similar to the reusability of [[aircraft]].  The company [[SpaceX]] is developing the technologies over a number of years to facilitate full and rapid reusability of space [[launch vehicle]]s. The project's long-term objectives include returning a launch vehicle [[multistage rocket|first stage]] to the launch site in minutes and to return a second stage to the [[launch pad]] following orbital realignment with the launch site and [[atmospheric entry|atmospheric reentry]] in up to 24 hours.  SpaceX's long term goal is that both stages of their orbital launch vehicle&lt;!-- they are only working on the first stage with the Falcon 9; will do both stages of the Mars Colonial Transporter --&gt; will be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return.&lt;ref name="pm20120207"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/rockets/elon-musk-on-spacexs-reusable-rocket-plans-6653023 |title=Elon Musk on SpaceX's Reusable Rocket Plans |work=Popular Mechanics |last=Simberg |first=Rand |date=February 8, 2012 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was publicly announced in 2011. SpaceX first achieved a [[Falcon 9 Flight 20|successful landing and recovery of a first stage]] in December 2015.  The [[SES-10|first re-flight of a landed first stage]] occurred in March 2017&lt;ref name=sn20170330/&gt; with the second occurring in June 2017, that one only five months after the maiden flight of the booster.&lt;ref name=sir-20170626 /&gt; The third attempt occurred in October 2017 with the [[SES-11]]/[[EchoStar-105]] mission. Second flights of refurbished first stages then became routine.

The [[reusable launch system]] technology was developed and initially used for the first stages of the [[Falcon (rocket family)|Falcon family]] of rockets.&lt;ref name=sn20141024/&gt; After stage [[Separation event|separation]], the return process involves flipping the booster around, an optional boostback burn to reverse its course, a reentry burn, controlling direction to arrive at the landing site and a landing burn to effect the final low-altitude deceleration and touchdown.   

SpaceX intended (from at least 2014) to develop technology to extend reusable flight hardware to second stages, a more challenging engineering problem because the vehicle is travelling at [[Orbital speed#Tangential velocities at altitude|orbital velocity]],&lt;ref name=nsf20160927/&gt;&lt;ref name=sn20141024/&gt;&lt;ref name=nsf20140307/&gt;
which is considered paramount to the plans Elon Musk is championing to enable the [[Colonization of Mars|settlement of Mars]]. It is thus planned to be developed for all of the flight hardware for the new SpaceX vehicles planned to transit to Mars,&lt;ref name=gq20151212/&gt;&lt;ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/&gt; with initial test flights expected no earlier than 2020.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927/&gt;  SpaceX will also experiment with second stage recovery on a few select Falcon 9 flights&lt;ref name=issR&amp;Dconf20170719-14:15/&gt; or Falcon Heavy flights.&lt;ref name=musk20170331&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/847882289581359104 |title=Considering trying to bring upper stage back on Falcon Heavy demo flight for full reusability |last=Musk|first=Elon |publisher=SpaceX |date=2017-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After 2017, much of the reusable technology development work and testing turned substantially toward advances in reusable second-stage-with-integrated-spaceship technology to support [[BFR (rocket)|BFR]] use not merely in Earth's atmosphere, but also as intended to be used on Solar system celestial bodies such as the [[Atmosphere_of_the_Moon|Moon]] and [[Atmosphere of Mars|Mars]] with very diverse atmospheric characteristics.  This includes the building of new test vehicles:  the high-altitude [[SpaceX_reusable_launch_system_development_program#Falcon_9_second-stage_as_mini-BFR_ship|mini-BFR test ship]] and the initial [[SpaceX_reusable_launch_system_development_program#BFR_development_ship|BFR development ship]] to be used initially for low-altitude, low-velocity testing. Flight testing is expected to begin in 2019.

SpaceX initially attempted to land the first stage of the [[Falcon 1#Reusability|Falcon 1 by parachute]], however the stage did not survive the re-entry into the atmosphere.

In 2012, it was projected that the first-stage separation of a [[Falcon 9R|reusable Falcon 9]] rocket would occur at a velocity of approximately {{convert|6|Mach|km/s km/h mph|sigfig=2}} rather than {{convert|10|Mach|km/s km/h mph|sigfig=2}} for an expendable Falcon 9, to provide the residual fuel necessary for the deceleration and turnaround maneuver and the controlled descent and landing.&lt;ref name="pm20120207" /&gt;

Musk stated in May 2013 that the goal of the program is to achieve full and rapid reusability of the first stage by 2015, and to develop full launch vehicle reusability following that as "part of a future design architecture".&lt;ref name="atd20130530"&gt;{{cite AV media |url=http://allthingsd.com/20130530/tesla-ceo-and-spacex-founder-elon-musk-the-full-d11-interview-video/ |title=Tesla CEO and SpaceX Founder Elon Musk: The Full D11 Interview (Video) |work=All Things D |last=Gannes |first=Liz |medium=Video interview |section=36:03 |date=May 30, 2013 |accessdate=May 31, 2013 |quote=hopeful that sometime in the next couple of years we'll be able to achieve full and rapid reusability of the first stage—which is about three-quarters of the cost of the rocket—and then with a future design architecture, achieve full reusability. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was consistent with Musk's strategic statement in 2012 that "The revolutionary breakthrough will come with rockets that are fully and rapidly reusable.

Also in May 2014, SpaceX publicly announced an extensive test program for a related reusable technology: a propulsively-landed [[space capsule]] called ''[[DragonFly (rocket)|DragonFly]]''.

== Economics of rocket reuse ==
In order to make the Falcon 9 reusable and return to the launch site, extra [[rocket propellant|propellant]] and [[landing gear]] must be carried on the first stage, requiring around a 30 percent reduction of the maximum payload to orbit in comparison with the expendable Falcon 9.&lt;ref name="bbc20130930" /&gt; {{needs update|date=November 2018}}[[Reusable launch system|Reflight]] of a previously used stage on a subsequent flight is dependent on the condition of the landed stage, and is a technique that has seen little use outside of the [[Space Shuttle]]'s reusable [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]]. In September 2013, SpaceX said that if all aspects of the test program were successful and if a customer is interested, the first reflight of a Falcon 9 booster stage could happen as early as late 2014.&lt;ref name="bbc20130930" /&gt;&lt;!-- should the historical statement re 2013 no longer belong in this section, it should probably move to the History subsection, and not just be deleted completely from this "good article." --&gt;
In December 2015, following the recovery of the [[Falcon 9 Flight 20|first stage from December 22 launch]], SpaceX projected that the first reflight of a recovered booster would likely occur in 2016, but that their plan was to not refly December 22 recovered stage for that purpose.&lt;ref name=bi20151225&gt;

Musk projected in 2015 that the reflight step of the program would be "straightforward," because of the multiple full duration firings of the engines that had been done on the ground, and the multiple engine restarts that had been demonstrated by that time, with no significant degradation seen.&lt;ref name=presserTranscript20151222&gt;

In 2015, industry analysts continued to forecast problems that could prevent economic reuse because costs to refurbish and relaunch the stage were not yet demonstrated, and the economic case for reuse would necessarily be highly dependent on launching frequently.&lt;ref name=cbs20151222&gt;

Both were successful, and both [[insurer]]s and launch service customers are readily supporting the newly emerging market in launch services provided by multiple-use boosters.&lt;ref name=sir-20170626&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.spaceintelreport.com/spacex-cuts-flight-refurbish-reflight-time-falcon-9-first-stage/ |title=SpaceX cuts flight-to-reflight time for Falcon 9 first stage |work=Space Intel Report |first=Peter B. |last=de Selding |date=June 26, 2017 |access-date=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical feasibility ==
Prior to the reusability program's success in December 2015, the [[Return To Launch Site|return]] of an orbital launch system booster rocket had never been accomplished, and many questioned both technical and economic feasibility. And even after this success, the ''rapid'' reuse of a rocket has not been attempted. Developing a reusable rocket is extremely challenging due to the small percentage of a rocket's mass that can make it to orbit.&lt;ref name="sdc20110930"/&gt;&lt;ref name=am201404&gt;
{{cite news |last1=Clash |first1=Jim |title=Elon Musk Interview |url=http://www.askmen.com/entertainment/right-stuff/elon-musk-interview-2.html |accessdate=September 27, 2014 |work=AskMen |date=April 2014 |quote=''Expendable rockets, which many smart people have worked on in the past, get maybe 2% of liftoff mass to orbit -- really not a lot. Then, when they’ve tried reusability, it’s resulted in negative payload, a 0 to 2% minus payload [laughs]. The trick is to figure out how to create a rocket that, if it were expendable, is so efficient in all of its systems that it would put 3% to 4% of its mass into orbit. On the other side, you have to be equally clever with the reusability elements such that the reusability penalty is no more than 2%, which would leave you with a net ideally of still 2% of usable load to orbit in a reusable scenario, if that makes sense. You have to pry those two things apart: Push up payload to orbit, push down the mass penalty for reusability -- and have enough left over to still do useful work.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a rocket's payload is only about 3% of the mass of the rocket which is also roughly the amount of mass in fuel that is required for the vehicle's re-entry.&lt;ref name="youtube20110929"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrVD3tcVWTY |title=National Press Club: The Future of Human Spaceflight |date=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elon Musk said at the beginning of the program that he believed the return, vertical landing and recovery was possible because the SpaceX manufacturing methodologies result in a rocket efficiency exceeding the typical 3% margin. A SpaceX rocket operating in the reusable configuration has approximately 30% less payload lift capacity than the same rocket in an [[expendable rocket|expendable]] configuration.&lt;ref name=pm20130930/&gt;

Although the [[reusable launch system]] technology was developed and initially used for the first stages of the Falcon family of rockets&lt;ref name=sn20141024/&gt; it is particularly well suited to the Falcon Heavy where the two [[Modular rocket|outer cores]] [[separation event|separate]] from the rocket earlier in the flight, and are therefore moving more slowly at stage separation. For example, on [[Falcon 9 Flight 20|Falcon 9 flight 20]], the speed at separation was close to 6000&amp;nbsp;km/h&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G8GJQumBFs |title=ORBCOMM-2 Full Launch Webcast |time=25:25 |publisher=SpaceX |accessdate=April 9, 2016 |date=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this allowed a return to near the launch site. On [[Falcon 9 Flight 22|flight 22]], going to a more-energetic [[Geostationary transfer orbit|GTO]] orbit, the higher velocity at separation was between 8000 and 9000&amp;nbsp;km/h. At these faster speeds it is not possible to return the booster to near the launch site for a landing; if a landing is attempted it needs to be hundreds of kilometers downrange on an [[Autonomous spaceport drone ship|autonomous droneship]].

== Test program ==
In 2013 SpaceX was testing reusable technologies both for its [[Booster (rocketry)|first-stage booster]] launch vehicle designs (with three test vehicles : [[Grasshopper (rocket)|Grasshopper]], [[F9R Dev1]], and [[F9R Dev2]]) — and for its new reusable [[Dragon V2]] [[space capsule]] (with a low-altitude test vehicle called [[DragonFly (rocket)|DragonFly]]).

SpaceX has publicly disclosed a multi-element, incremental test program for booster stages that includes four aspects:

=== Flight test vehicles ===
[[File:SpaceX Grasshopper rocket midflight.png|thumb|Grasshopper rocket performing a 325 meter flight followed by a soft propulsive landing in an attempt to develop technologies for a reusable launch vehicle.]]

SpaceX used a set of experimental technology-demonstrator, [[suborbital]] [[Reusable launch system|reusable launch vehicles]] (RLV) to begin [[flight testing]] their reusable booster technologies in 2012.  Two versions of the prototype reusable test rockets were built—the 106-foot tall ''Grasshopper'' (formerly designated as ''Grasshopper v1.0'') and the 160-foot tall ''Falcon 9 Reusable Development Vehicle'', or ''F9R Dev1''—formerly known as ''Grasshopper v1.1''&lt;ref name=nsf20140422/&gt;—as well as a [[space capsule|capsule prototype]] for testing propulsive landings of the [[Dragon 2|Dragon]] crew and cargo capsule for the Falcon 9—''DragonFly''.&lt;ref name=nsf20140422/&gt;
Grasshopper was built in 2011–2012 for low-altitude, low-velocity hover testing that began in September 2012 and concluded in October 2013 after eight test flights.&lt;ref name="faa20110922" /&gt;&lt;ref name="satspot20110926" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nsf20140422/&gt;
The second prototype vehicle design, F9R Dev1, was built on the much larger [[Falcon 9 v1.1]] booster stage was used to further extend the low-altitude flight testing [[flight envelope|envelope]] on a vehicle that better matched the actual flight hardware, and made five test flights in 2014.&lt;ref name=nsf20140422/&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc20110927"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/44692930/ |title=A rocket that lifts off—and lands—on launch pad |work=NBC News |last=Klotz |first=Irene |date=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsw20121002" /&gt; The low-altitude, low-speed flights of the test vehicle rockets and capsule were conducted at the [[SpaceX Rocket Development and Test Facility|SpaceX Rocket Test Facility]] in [[McGregor, Texas]]&lt;ref name="faa20110922" /&gt;&lt;ref name="satspot20110926" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nsf20140422/&gt;

In 2018, SpaceX is also developing a highly-modified Falcon 9 second stage to be used for testing of a number of reentry technologies needed for the full-scale BFR spaceship, as well as a BFR development vehicle to test propulsive landing technologies.&lt;ref name=sn20181107/&gt;

==== Grasshopper ====
{{main|Grasshopper (rocket)}}

Grasshopper, the company's first [[VTVL]] test vehicle, consisted of a [[Falcon 9 v1.0]] first-stage tank, a single [[Merlin 1D|Merlin-1D]] engine, and four permanently attached steel landing legs.

Grasshopper was also known as Grasshopper version 1.0, or Grasshopper v1.0, prior to 2014 during the time the followon Grasshopper-class test vehicles were being built.

In addition to three test flights in 2012, five additional tests were successfully flown by the end of October 2013{{mdash}}including the fourth test overall in March 2013{{mdash}}in which Grasshopper doubled its highest leap to rise to {{convert|80.1|m|sp=us}} with a 34-second flight.&lt;ref name="faa20130310"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spacex.com/news/2013/03/23/grasshopper-completes-highest-leap-date |title=Grasshopper Completes Highest Leap to Date |work=SpaceX.com |date=March 10, 2013 |accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the seventh test, in August 2013, the vehicle flew to {{convert|250|m|ft|sp=us}} during a 60-second flight and executed a {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us|adj=on}} lateral maneuver before returning to the pad.&lt;ref name="nbc20130814"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/spacexs-grasshopper-test-rocket-flies-sideways-successfully-6C10923106 |title=SpaceX's Grasshopper test rocket flies sideways successfully |work=NBC News |last=Boyle |first=Alan |date=August 14, 2013 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grasshopper made its eighth and final test flight on October 7, 2013, flying to {{convert|744|m|sp=us}} (0.46 miles) before making its eighth successful landing.&lt;ref name="sx20131012fb"&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZDkItO-0a4 |title=Grasshopper flies to its highest height to date |publisher=SpaceX |date=October 12, 2013 |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grasshopper test vehicle is now retired.&lt;ref name="sn20131017"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/launch-report/37740spacex-retires-grasshopper-new-test-rig-to-fly-in-december |title=SpaceX Retires Grasshopper, New Test Rig To Fly in December |work=Space News |last=Klotz |first=Irene |date=October 17, 2013 |accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Falcon 9 Reusable Development Vehicle ====

As early as October 2012, SpaceX discussed development of a second-generation Grasshopper test vehicle, which was to have lighter landing legs that fold up on the side of the rocket, a different engine bay, and would be nearly 50% longer than the first Grasshopper vehicle.&lt;ref name="nsw20121002"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newspacewatch.com/articles/a-2nd-gen-grasshopper-a-new-video-of-first-hop.html |title=A 2nd-gen Grasshopper + A new video of first hop |work=NewSpace Watch |last=Lindsey |first=Clark |date=October 2, 2012 |accessdate=November 4, 2012 &lt;!--  REMOVED https://archive.is/ archive link, as a wikibot reports that is is on some sort of "local blacklist".

It was rebuilt as the {{nowrap|F9R Dev1}} with extensible landing legs.  Five test flights occurred in 2014.&lt;ref name=nsf20140422/&gt;

The second VTVL flight test vehicle—F9R Dev1, built on the much longer [[Falcon 9 v1.1]] first-stage tank, with retractable landing legs—made its first test flight on April 17, 2014.&lt;ref name=nsf20140422/&gt;&lt;ref name=wt20140417/&gt; F9R Dev1 was used for low-altitude test flights in the McGregor, Texas area—projected maximum altitude below {{convert|10000|ft|order=flip|sp=us}}&lt;ref name=nsf20140422/&gt;—with a total of five test flights, all made during 2014.

By April 2014, a third flight test vehicle—F9R Dev2—was being built and was planned to be flown at the high-altitude test range available at [[Spaceport America]] in [[New Mexico]] where it was expected to be flown at altitudes up to {{convert|300000|ft|order=flip|sp=us}}-plus.&lt;ref name=nsf20140422/&gt;  It was never flown as SpaceX moved the high-altitude testing program to its [[SpaceX Falcon 9 booster post-mission, controlled-descent, test program|controlled-descent testing of used boosters]] following their use on a paid orbital launch and ascent.

==== DragonFly ====
{{main|DragonFly (rocket)}}

[[DragonFly (rocket)|DragonFly]] was a prototype test article for a propulsively landed version of the [[SpaceX Dragon]] [[space capsule|capsule]], a [[suborbital spaceflight|suborbital]] [[reusable launch vehicle]] (RLV), intended for low-altitude [[flight test]]ing. {{asof|2014|05}} it was planned to undergo a test program in Texas at the McGregor Rocket Test Facility, during 2014–2015.&lt;ref name=nbc20140521/&gt;&lt;ref name=faa201311&gt;{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Michael |last2=Salton |first2=Alexandria |last3=Downing |first3=Micah |title=Draft Environmental Assessment for Issuing an Experimental Permit to SpaceX for Operation of the Dragon Fly Vehicle at the McGregor Test Site, Texas, May 2014 – Appendices |publisher=Blue Ridge Research and Consulting, LCC |pages=12 |date=November 12, 2013 |url=http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/media/20140513_DragonFly_DraftEA_Appendices%28reduced%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2014}}

==== Falcon 9 second-stage as mini-BFR ship ====

In November 2018, SpaceX announced work on a heavily-modified Falcon 9 second stage that would be used for [[atmospheric reentry]] [[flight testing|testing]] of a number of technologies needed for the full-scale BFR spaceship, including an ultra-light [[heat shield]] and high-[[Mach number|Mach]] control surfaces.  Musk indicated it would be "upgraded to be like a mini-[[BFR spaceship|BFR ship]]" but that the stage would not be used for landing tests, as the company already believes it has a good handle on propulsive landings.  The first test flight of the modified stage is planned to be no earlier than mid-2019.&lt;ref name=sn20181107&gt;

=== Falcon 9 booster post-mission flight tests ===
[[File:CRS-6 first stage booster landing attempt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|CRS-6 booster landing attempt]]
{{Main|Falcon 9 first-stage landing tests}}

In an arrangement highly unusual for launch vehicles, SpaceX began in 2013 using some first stages of the Falcon 9 v1.1 rockets for propulsive-return controlled-descent [[flight testings|flight tests]] after they completed the boost phase of an orbital flight.  Since the advent of [[orbital spaceflight|spaceflight]] in [[Sputnik 1|1957]], launch vehicle boosters would ordinarily just be discarded after setting their payloads on their way.  The over-water tests started by SpaceX took place in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans south of [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] and east of [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]].  The first flight test occurred on September 29, 2013, after the second stage with the [[CASSIOPE]] and [[nanosat]] payloads separated from the booster. These descent and simulated landing tests continued over the next two years, with the second flight test taking place on April 18, 2014,&lt;ref name="bbc20130930" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ut20140419" /&gt;&lt;ref name=dn20140224/&gt; two more test in [[List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches#2014|2014]], and four subsequent tests conducted in 2015.&lt;ref name=nsf20151231&gt;

Many of these descent and landing tests were tested on active orbital spaceflight missions for SpaceX customers as the booster reentered the atmosphere and attempted recoverable landings. 

==== Re-entry and controlled descent development ====
Following analysis of the flight test data from the first booster-controlled descent in September 2013, SpaceX announced it had successfully tested a large amount of new technology on the flight, and that coupled with the technology advancements made on the Grasshopper low-altitude landing demonstrator, they were ready to test a full recovery of the booster stage. The first flight test was successful; SpaceX said it was "able to successfully transition from vacuum through [[hypersonic]], through [[supersonic]], through [[transonic]], and light the engines all the way and control the stage all the way through [the atmosphere]".&lt;ref name=pm20130930&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/rockets/musk-spacex-now-has-all-the-pieces-for-reusable-rockets-15985616 |title=Musk: SpaceX Now Has "All the Pieces" For Truly Reusable Rockets |work=Popular Mechanics |last=Belfiore |first=Michael |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musk said, "the next attempt to recovery [sic] the Falcon 9 first stage will be on the fourth flight of the upgraded rocket.

This second flight test took place during the April 2014 Dragon flight to the ISS. SpaceX attached [[Launch vehicle landing gear|landing legs]] to the first stage, decelerated it over the ocean and attempted a simulated landing over the water, following the ignition of the second stage on the [[SpaceX CRS-3|third cargo resupply mission]] contracted to NASA. The first stage was successfully slowed down enough for a soft landing over the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name="ut20140419" /&gt; SpaceX announced in February 2014 the intent to continue the tests to land the first-stage booster in the ocean until precision control from hypersonic all the way through subsonic regimes has been proven.&lt;ref name=dn20140224&gt;{{cite news |last=Klotz |first=Irene |title=SpaceX Falcon Rocket to Test Landing Legs |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/private-spaceflight/spacex-falcon-rocket-to-test-precision-landing-legs-140224.htm |accessdate=February 25, 2014 |newspaper=Discovery News |date=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Five additional controlled-descent tests were conducted in the remainder of 2014 through April 2015, including two attempts to land on a [[floating landing platform]]—a SpaceX-built [[Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship]]—on the [[Atlantic Ocean]] east of the launch site, both of which brought the vehicle to the landing platform, but neither of which resulted in a successful landing.

==== First landing on ground pad ====
[[File:ORBCOMM-2_First-Stage_Landing_(23271687254).jpg|thumb|Falcon 9 Flight 20's first stage landing viewed from a helicopter, December 22, 2015.]]
During the [[SpaceX CRS-7|2015 launch hiatus]], SpaceX requested regulatory approval from the [[FAA]] to attempt returning their [[Falcon 9 Flight 20|next flight]] to [[CCAFS|Cape Canaveral]] instead of targeting a floating platform in the ocean.  The goal was to [[VTVL|land the booster vertically]] at the leased ''[[Landing Zone 1]]'' facility—the former [[Launch Complex 13]] where SpaceX had recently built a large rocket landing pad.&lt;ref name=ft201511201&gt;

==== Near-misses on the oceans ====
[[Falcon 9 Flight 21]] launched the [[Jason-3]] satellite on January 17, 2016, and attempted to land on the [[autonomous spaceport drone ship|floating platform]] ''Just Read the Instructions'',&lt;ref name=nbc20160107&gt;

Approximately 9 minutes into the flight, the live video feed from the drone ship went down due to the losing its lock on the uplink satellite.
The vehicle landed smoothly onto the vessel but one of the four landing legs failed to lock properly, reportedly due to ice from the heavy pre-launch [[fog]] preventing a lockout [[collet]] from latching.&lt;ref name=sfn20160118&gt;

[[Falcon 9 Flight 22|Flight 22]] was carrying a heavy payload of {{convert|5271|kg|sigfig=2}} to [[geostationary transfer orbit]] (GTO).  This was heavier than previously advertised maximum lift capacity to GTO being made possible by going slightly [[subsynchronous orbit|subsynchronous]]. Following delays caused by failure of [[Falcon 9 Flight 19|Flight 19]] SpaceX agreed to provide extra thrust to the [[SES-9]] satellite to take it [[supersynchronous orbit|supersynchronous]].&lt;ref name=sfn20160224&gt;

The change [SpaceX offered] in the Falcon 9’s launch profile will put SES 9 into an initial orbit with an apogee approximately 24,419 miles (39,300 kilometers) above Earth, a low point 180 miles (290 kilometers) up, and a track tilted about 28 degrees to the equator''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result of these factors, there was little propellant left to execute a full reentry and landing test with normal margins. Consequently the Falcon 9 first stage followed a [[ballistic trajectory]] after separation and re-entered the atmosphere at high velocity, making it less likely to land successfully.&lt;ref name=sxPressKit20160223&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/spacex_ses9_press_kit_final.pdf |format=PDF |title=SES-9 Mission |work=Press Kit |publisher=SpaceX |date=February 23, 2016 |accessdate=February 24, 2016 |quote=This mission is going to a Geostationary Transfer Orbit.

However the rocket was moving too fast and was destroyed when it collided with the drone ship. SpaceX collected valuable data on the extended flight envelope required to recover boosters from GTO missions.

==== Landings at sea ====

[[File:CRS-8 (26239020092).jpg|thumb|right|First stage of Falcon 9 Flight 23 landed on autonomous droneship]]
Starting in January 2015, SpaceX positioned stable floating platforms a few hundred miles off the coast along the rocket trajectory; those transformed barges were called [[autonomous spaceport drone ship]]s.&lt;ref name=nsf20141124&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bergin |first1=Chris |title=SpaceX's Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship ready for action |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/11/spacex-autonomous-spaceport-drone-ship/ |accessdate=24 November 2014 |work=NasaSpaceFlight.com |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 8, 2016, Falcon 9 Flight 23, the third flight of [[Falcon 9 Full Thrust|the full-thrust version]], delivered the [[SpaceX CRS-8]] cargo on its way to the [[International Space Station]] while the [[Falcon 9 booster B1021|first stage]] conducted a boostback and re-entry maneuver over the Atlantic ocean. Nine minutes after liftoff, the booster landed vertically on the drone ship ''[[Of Course I Still Love You]]'', 300&amp;nbsp;km from the Florida coastline, achieving a long-sought-after milestone for the SpaceX reusability development program.&lt;ref name=flight23&gt;{{cite news |url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/08/spacex-rocket-makes-spectacular-landing-on-drone-ship/ |title=SpaceX Rocket Makes Spectacular Landing on Drone Ship |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |first=Nadia |last=Drake |date=April 8, 2016 |accessdate=April 8, 2016 |quote=To space and back, in less than nine minutes? Hello, future.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second successful drone ship landing occurred on May 6, 2016, with the next flight which launched [[JCSAT-14]] to GTO. This second landing at sea was more difficult than the previous one because the booster at separation was traveling about {{convert|8350|km/h|abbr=on}} compared to {{convert|6650|km/h|abbr=on}} on the CRS-8 launch to [[low Earth orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pUAydjne5M|title=CRS-8 Dragon Hosted Webcast|first=|last=SpaceX|date=April 8, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pUAydjne5M|title=CRS-8 Dragon Hosted Webcast|first=|last=SpaceX|date=April 8, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuing their experiments to test the limits of the flight envelope, SpaceX opted for a shorter landing burn with three engines instead of the single-engine burns seen in earlier attempts; this approach consumes less fuel by leaving the stage in free fall as long as possible and decelerating more sharply, thereby minimizing the amount of energy expended to counter gravity.&lt;ref name=musk-tweet-20160506&gt;

That's important to minimize gravity losses.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elon Musk indicated this first stage may not be flown again instead being used as a life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/spacex/2016/05/16/landed-spacex-rocket-suffered-max-damage/84454230/|title=SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage booster suffered 'max' damage on landing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third successful landing followed on 27 May, again following deceleration from the high speed required for a GTO launch. The landing crushed a "crush core" in one leg, leading to a notable tilt to the stage as it stood on the drone ship.&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt;

==== Routine procedure ====
{{Main|List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches}}
Over the subsequent missions, landing of the first stage gradually became a routine procedure, and since January 2017 SpaceX ceased to refer to their landing attempts as "experimental". Low-energy missions to the [[ISS]] fly back to the launch site and land at [[Landing Zone 1|LZ-1]], whereas more demanding satellite missions land on drone ships a few hundred miles downrange. Occasional missions with heavy payloads, such as [[EchoStar 23]], do not attempt to land, flying in [[Expendable launch system|expendable]] configuration without fins and legs.

Further successful landings occurred:
* on the LZ-1 ground pad: [[CRS-9]] on 18 July 2016, [[CRS-10]] on 19 February 2017, [[NROL]]-76 on 1 May, [[CRS-11]] on 3 June, [[CRS-12]] on 14 August, [[Boeing X-37B|Boeing X-37B OTV-5]] on 7 September, [[CRS-13]] on 15 December, and [[Zuma (satellite)|Zuma]] on 8 January 2018.&lt;!-- UPDATE after each recovery on land --&gt;
* on drone ships: [[JCSAT-16]] on 14 August 2016, [[Iridium NEXT]]-1 on 14 January 2017, [[SES-10]] on 30 March and [[BulgariaSat-1]] on 23 June (first and second recoveries of re-flown boosters), [[Iridium NEXT]]-2 on 25 June, [[Formosat-5]] on 24 August, [[Iridium NEXT]]-3 on 9 October, [[SES-11]]/[[EchoStar 105]] on 11 October, and [[Koreasat 5A]] on 30 October 2017.&lt;!-- UPDATE after each recovery at sea --&gt;

==== Future tests ====
{{main article| List of Falcon 9 first-stage boosters | List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches#Future launches}}

During 2016 and 2017, SpaceX has recovered a number of first stages to both land and drone ships, helping them optimize the procedures needed to re-use the boosters rapidly. In January 2016 Elon Musk estimated the likelihood of success at 70 percent for all landing attempts in 2016, hopefully rising to 90 percent in 2017; he also cautioned that we should expect "a few more RUDs" (''Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly'', Musk's euphemism to denote destruction of the vehicle on impact).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=elonmusk |author-link=Elon Musk |number=689299216607232000 |date=January 19, 2016 |title=My best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musk's prediction was vindicated, as 5 out of 8 flown boosters ({{percent|5|8}}) were recovered in 2016, and 14 out of 14 ({{percent|14|14}}) in 2017. Three GTO missions for heavy payloads ([[EchoStar#Satellite fleet|EchoStar 23]] in March 2017, [[Inmarsat-5 F4]] in May 2017 and [[Intelsat 35e]] in July 2017) were flown in an [[expendable launch system|expendable]] configuration, not equipped for landing. One booster which could have been recovered was intentionally flown without legs and left to sink after a soft touchdown in the ocean (booster B1036 for the [[Iridium NEXT]] 31–40 mission in December 2017).

Since late 2017, incremental testing with refinements to the fairing recovery design have been conducted. SpaceX has indicated that they expected to recover an intact fairing in 2017, and to fly a recovered fairing in 2018.&lt;ref name=issR&amp;Dconf20170719-14:15/&gt; {{As of|December 2017}}, no official information on progress in the fairing recovery process was available.

=== First-stage reuse ===
{{As of|2018|08|06}}, SpaceX had [[List of Falcon 9 first-stage boosters|recovered 21 first-stage boosters from previous missions]], of which six were recovered twice, yielding a total 27 landings. In 2017, SpaceX flew a total of 5 missions out of 20 with re-used boosters ({{percent|5|20}}). In total, 14 boosters have been re-flown {{as of|August 2018|lc=y}}.

On July 28, 2016, the first stage from the [[JCSAT-2B]] mission was successfully test-fired for a full duration at the SpaceX McGregor facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZQY902xQcw |title=Landed Falcon 9 First Stage Test Firing |publisher=SpaceX |date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first reuse attempt occurred on 30 March 2017&lt;ref name="SpaceflightNowSchedule"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2017/03/30/ses-10-mission-status-center/|title=Live coverage: SpaceX aims for Thursday launch of previously-flown rocket - Spaceflight Now|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the launch of [[SES-10]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-spacex-rocket-20160829-snap-story.html |title=SpaceX signs first customer for launch of a reused rocket |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Samantha |last=Masunaga |date=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a successful flight and second landing of the [[Falcon 9 booster B1021|B1021 first stage]] recovered from the [[SpaceX CRS-8|CRS-8]] mission of April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/nextspace/2016/08/30/ses-becomes-first-reusable-rocket-customer-spacex/ |title=SES Becomes First Reusable Rocket Customer for SpaceX |work=Via Satellite |first=Caleb |last=Henry |date=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reflight succeeded in June 2017 with [[BulgariaSat-1]] riding the [[B1029]] booster from the January 2017 [[Iridium NEXT]] mission.&lt;ref name=nsf-20170623&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/06/spacex-falcon-9-second-flight-bulgariasat-1-mission/ |title=SpaceX Falcon 9 success with second flight involving BulgariaSat-1 mission |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |first=William |last=Graham |date=June 23, 2017 |access-date=June 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booster B1031 flew the [[CRS-10]] mission to the [[ISS]] in February 2017 and helped loft communications satellite [[SES-11]] to [[geostationary orbit]] in October 2017. Boosters B1035 and B1036 were flown twice each for the same customer, B1035 for [[NASA]] missions [[CRS-11]] and [[CRS-13]] in June and December 2017, and B1036 for two batches of 10 [[Iridium NEXT]] satellites, also in June and December 2017. B1032 was re-used for [[GovSat-1]] in January 2018 after [[NROL-76]] in May 2017. Finally, B1023 and B1025 were re-used as side boosters on the [[Falcon Heavy test flight]] in February 2018.

SpaceX spent four months refurbishing the first booster to be re-used, [[B1021]], and launched it again after approximately one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://spaceflightnow.com/2017/03/27/hotfire-test-completed-ahead-of-milestone-falcon-9-launch-thursday/ |work= Spaceflight Now |title= Hotfire test completed ahead of milestone Falcon 9 launch Thursday |first= Stephen |last= Clark |date= 2017-03-27 |accessdate= 2017-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second booster to be flown again, [[B1029]], was refurbished in "only a couple of months"&lt;ref name=sir-20170626 /&gt; and re-launched after five months.&lt;ref name=nsf-20170623 /&gt; Elon Musk initially stated a goal to turn around a first stage within 24 hours before the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/31/spacex-makes-history-successfully-launching-first-recycled-rocket/ |newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |agency= [[Reuters]] |title= SpaceX makes history by successfully launching first recycled rocket booster |date= 2017-03-31 |accessdate= 2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musk remains convinced that this goal can be met, though SpaceX is now targeting 2019 to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Berger |first1=Eric |title=After “crazy hard” development, SpaceX’s Block 5 rocket has taken flight |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/05/spacexs-block-5-rocket-passes-its-first-test-but-final-exams-remain/ |accessdate=June 5, 2018 |work=Ars Technica |date=May 12, 2018 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boosters [[B1019]] and [[B1021]] were retired and put on display. [[B1029]] was also retired after the [[BulgariaSat-1]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Falcon 9 first-stage boosters|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_first-stage_boosters|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}} B1023, B1025, B1031 and B1035 were recovered a second time, while B1032 and B1036 were deliberately sunk at sea after a soft ocean touchdown.

=== Block 5 boosters===
With a streak of 17 successful recovery attempts of the first stage throughout 2017, SpaceX has focused on rapid reusability of first stage boosters.  Block 3 and Block 4 proved economically feasible to be flown twice, as 11 such boosters have been reflown in 2017 and 2018.  Block 5 has been designed with multiple reuses in mind, up to 10 reuses with minimal inspection and up to 100 uses with refurbishment.  New aggressive reentry profiles were experimented with expendable Block 3 and Block 4 boosters in early 2018, to test out the limitations on the range of recoverable launch margins that are potential for future Block 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-old-gen-falcon-9-ready-rapid-reuse-block-5-rocket/|title=SpaceX expends “old-gen” Falcon 9 to ready for upcoming rapid reuse rocket|website=www.teslarati.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fairing reuse ===
As early as mid-2015, Musk hinted that SpaceX might be working on [[Payload fairing|fairing]] reusability, following the discovery of wreckage of an unidentified Falcon 9 launch vehicle section off the coast of [[The Bahamas]], and was subsequently confirmed by SpaceX to be a component of a payload fairing that had washed ashore.&lt;ref name=sn20150601&gt;
{{cite web |last1=Leone|first1=Dan |title=Beachcomber Finds SpaceX Rocket Wreckage in Bahamas |url=http://spacenews.com/beachcomber-finds-spacex-rocket-wreckage-in-bahamas/ |work=[[SpaceNews]] |accessdate=8 March 2018 |date=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By April 2016, they had publicly announced Falcon 9 fairing recovery as an objective.&lt;ref name=verge20170330/&gt; The cost of the fairing is about $6 million each, which accounts for 10 percent of the overall launch costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clark |first1=Stephen |title=New photos illustrate progress in SpaceX’s fairing recovery attempts – Spaceflight Now |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/06/01/new-photos-illustrate-progress-in-spacexs-fairing-recovery-attempts/ |website=spaceflightnow.com |publisher=Pole Star Publications Ltd |accessdate=7 August 2018 |date=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, as part of the [[SES-10]] mission, SpaceX for the first time performed a controlled landing of the payload fairing and successfully recovered a fairing half, aided by [[Attitude control thruster|attitude-control thrusters]] and a [[steerable parachute]], helping it glide towards a gentle touchdown on water.&lt;ref name=sn20170330/&gt;&lt;ref name=verge20170330/&gt;
The company announced intent to land the fairings eventually on a dry flexible structure, jokingly described by Musk as a "floating bouncy-castle", with the aim of full fairing reuse.&lt;ref name=floridatoday_26216836069515264/&gt;
With successive tests and refinements on several flights, intact fairing recovery was stated as an objective for 2017, with reflight of a recovered fairing planned in 2018.&lt;ref name=issR&amp;Dconf20170719-14:15/&gt; 

The "bouncy castle" idea was superseded by a net strung between large arms of  a fast [[platform supply vessel]] named ''[[Mr. Steven]]''. The recovery vessel is equipped with [[dynamic positioning]] systems, and was tested after the launch of the [[Paz (satellite)|Paz]] satellite from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in that 2017.&lt;ref name=techcrunch20180220&gt;{{cite news|last1=Etherington|first1=Darrell|title=SpaceX to use a net boat called ‘Mr. Steven’ to recover next rocket&amp;nbsp;fairing|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/20/spacex-to-use-a-net-boat-called-mr-steven-to-recover-next-rocket-fairing/|accessdate=February 20, 2018|work=TechCrunch|date=February 20, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsf-20180225"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baylor|first1=Michael|title=SpaceX’s Mr. Steven, the FSV fairing catcher – NASASpaceFlight.com|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/02/spacexs-mr-steven-fsv-fairing-catcher/|accessdate=February 26, 2018|work=NASASpaceFlight.com|date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mission was also the first to use a version&amp;nbsp;2 fairing, explicitly designed to "improve survivability for post-launch recovery attempts, and to be reusable on future missions".&lt;ref name="nsf-20180220"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graham|first1=William|title=SpaceX Falcon 9 set for PAZ launch with Starlink demo and new fairing – NASASpaceFlight.com|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/02/spacex-falcon-9-paz-launch-starlink-demo-new-fairing/|accessdate=February 21, 2018|work=NASASpaceFlight.com|date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This recovery attempt was not fully successful; the fairing missed the boat by a few hundred meters but landed intact in the water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=elonmusk |author-link=Elon Musk |number=966692641533390848 |date=22 Feb 2018 |title=Missed by a few hundred meters, but fairing landed intact in water.

In October 2018, at least two fairing recovery tests were performed, involving ''Mr. Steven'' and a helicopter, which would drop a fairing half from the height of about 3300 meters. The actual outcome of the tests is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ralph |first=Eric |title=SpaceX's Mr. Steven highlights ambiguity of Falcon fairing catches with port return |url=https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-mr-steven-port-return-falcon-fairing-catch-uncertainty/ |website=Teslarati.com |date=October 19, 2018 |accessdate=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second-stage reuse ===

Despite early public statements that SpaceX would endeavor to make the Falcon 9 second-stage reusable as well, by late 2014, they determined that the mass needed for a re-entry heat shield, landing engines, and other equipment to support recovery of the second stage as well as the diversion of development resources from other company objectives was at that time prohibitive, and indefinitely suspended their second-stage reusability plans for the Falcon rockets.&lt;ref name="ElonMuskMITInteview"&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y13jbl7ASxY&amp;t=14m20s |title=Elon Musk MIT Interview |time=14:20 |first=C.

However, in July 2017&lt;ref name=issR&amp;Dconf20170719-14:15/&gt; they indicated that they might do [[Flight test|experimental tests]] on recovering one or more second-stages in order to learn more about reusability to inform their [[BFR (rocket)|new, much-larger, ''BFR'' launch vehicle]] development process,&lt;ref name=sn20171121&gt;

and in May 2018 provided additional details about how they might carry out some of that testing.&lt;ref name=nsf20180517&gt;
{{cite news |last=Baylor|first=Michael |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/05/block-5-spacex-increase-launch-cadence-lower-prices/ |title=With Block 5, SpaceX to increase launch cadence and lower prices |work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |date=2018-05-17 |accessdate=2018-05-22 |quote=''Musk: “in the upcoming flights [SpaceX will] gather data about the reentry experience of the upper stage. Previously, we had not put a lot of effort into gathering data from the upper stage after it does its disposal burn. We will monitoring at what altitude and speed the stage breaks up…” Collecting this data is not easy. Musk explained that “it’s tricky because it comes in like a meteor. It’s sort of like a ball of plasma. You can only broadcast diagonally backwards, so we will be looking to communicate, probably [with] the Iridium constellation, and try to transmit basic data about temperature, basic health of the stage, velocity, and altitude.”'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''BFR'' is planned to replace all existing SpaceX launch and space vehicles after the mid-2020s: [[Falcon 9]], [[Falcon Heavy]] and the [[Dragon spacecraft]], aimed initially at the Earth-orbit [[Space launch market competition|launch market]] but with capability to support [[Beyond Earth orbit|long-duration spaceflight]] in the [[cislunar]] and [[Exploration of Mars|Mars mission]] environments.&lt;ref name=musk20170929&gt;
{{cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdUX3ypDVwI | people=Elon Musk | title=Becoming a Multiplanet Species |date=29 September 2017 |medium=video | location=68th annual meeting of the International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide, Australia | publisher=SpaceX | via=YouTube | accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Both stages will be fully reusable.  The integrated [[second stage|second-stage]]-with-[[spaceship]] design has not been used in previous launch vehicles.&lt;ref name=musk20170929/&gt;

== Operational flow ==

In the first year of successful stage return from the experimental test flights, SpaceX performed ''[[ad hoc]]'' and flight-specific evaluation and component testing on each successfully landed stage.  Stages were processed and initially evaluated in either launch hangars, or for Cape Canaveral landings, in the new hangar SpaceX recently completed at [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39]]. Returned rocket parts have also been transported to [[SpaceX Hawthorne]] and [[SpaceX McGregor]] for engineering evaluation and testing.

In February 2017, after eight rocket cores had successfully landed — seven of them having launched from Cape Canaveral — SpaceX announced plans to expand their physical facilities to process and refurbish rockets.  They will do so in both leased space and in a new building to be built in [[Port Canaveral]], [[Florida]], near the location where the Atlantic [[Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship]] is berthed, and where stages that land on the [[East Coast of the United States|east-coast]] droneship are now removed from the ship.&lt;ref name=ft20160824&gt;

Compiled binary files can contain [[Debug symbol|debug information]] which is not necessary for program execution, rather it is useful for [[debugging]] and finding problems or [[Software bug|bugs]] in the program. Stripped binary is a binary file without these [[Debug symbol|debugging symbols]] and thus lesser in size and gives potentially better performance than a non-stripped binary.

A stripped binary makes  it hard to [[Disassembler|disassemble]] or [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] which also in turn makes it difficult to find problems or bugs in the program.

Stripped binary can be produced with the help of the [[compiler]] itself, e.g. [[GNU Compiler Collection|GNU GCC]] compilers' &lt;code&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt; flag, or with a dedicated tool like [[strip (Unix)|strip]] on [[Unix]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1074">A '''sunset industry''' is an industry in decline, one that has passed its peak or boom periods.  As one example, [[analog signal|analogue]] recording technologies for audio or video have been supplanted by [[digital recording|digital equivalents]]; although analogue equipment is still offered, sales have declined dramatically and are not expected to recover, so this segment of the market has been branded a 'sunset industry'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''TM Forum''' is a non-profit [[industry association]] for [[service provider]]s and their suppliers in the [[telecommunication]]s industry. Members include communications and digital service providers, telephone companies, [[cable operators]], [[network operator]]s, [[software]] suppliers, equipment suppliers, [[systems integrator]]s and management consultancies. {{As of|2017 |06}}, the Forum had over 850 member companies that collectively generate US$2 trillion in revenue and serve five billion customers across 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tmforum.org/about-tm-forum/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
TM Forum provides an open, collaborative environment along with practical tools and information to help its members in their digital transformation initiatives. Its services include collaboration programs and proof-of-concept projects, industry research and [[Benchmarking|benchmarks]], [[technology roadmap]]s, [[best practice|best-practice]] guidebooks, '''[[business process]]''' guidelines and open [[Application programming interface|API]]s, as well as certified [[training]], conferences and publications.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tmforum.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum also provides its member community with [[marketing]] and [[business networking|networking]] opportunities.

TM Forum's work includes [[Frameworx]], [[Business Process Framework (eTOM)]], [[Frameworx Shared Information/Data Model]] (SID) and [[Telecom Application Map]] (TAM).{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The [[Object Management Group]] endorsed some of the TM Forum's specifications in a telecommunications special interest group by 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://telecom.omg.org/telecom_task_force_roadmap.htm|title=Telecom PSIG Roadmap|date=February 13, 2004|work=Web site|publisher=Object Management Group|accessdate=October 4, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313110033/http://telecom.omg.org/telecom_task_force_roadmap.htm|archivedate=March 13, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the term "[[cloud computing]]" became popular, in 2009 TM Forum joined a group called the Cloud Standards Coordination Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/government/cloud-saas/groups-seek-cloud-computing-standards/218500732|title=Groups Seek Cloud Computing Standards|author=J.

===OSI/Network Management Forum===
The OSI/Network Management Forum  was founded in 1988 by eight companies to collaboratively solve [[system]]s and operational [[management]] issues with the [[OSI protocols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= An open network management architecture: OSI/NM Forum architecture and concepts |work= IEEE Network |publisher= IEEE Communications Society |authors= J.

In 1998 the name was changed to the TeleManagement Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= About the TM Forum: History |url= http://www.tmforum.org/History/1086/home.html |accessdate= October 12, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111109082831/http://www.tmforum.org/History/1086/home.html |archivedate= November 9, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IPsphere===
A group called the Infranet Initiative Council was created by [[Juniper Networks]] in April 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Juniper unveils 'infranet' council |date= April 21, 2004 |author= Jim Duffy |work= Network World |url= http://www.networkworld.com/edge/news/2004/0421juniperintra.html |accessdate= October 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The group said it was concerned with quality, reliability and security interfaces between [[telecommunications service provider]]s that were providing services for the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Frequently Asked Questions |work= Infranet Initiative Council web site |url= http://www.infranet.org/about/faqs/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050411113229/http://www.infranet.org/about/faqs/ |archivedate= April 11, 2005 |accessdate= October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Pradeep Sindhu]] used the term "infranet" to compare the public Internet to more traditional physical [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= What the heck's an inFRAnet? |work= Network World |date= September 27, 2004 |author= Beth Schultz |url= http://www.nwfusion.com/buzz/2004/092704infranet.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050425075800/http://www.nwfusion.com/buzz/2004/092704infranet.html |archivedate= April 25, 2005 |accessdate= October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s the boundary between telecoms equipment and IT hardware has become blurred as a result of the growth of the internet and its increasing role in the transfer of telecoms data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/167154|title=Telecoms equipment - We have the technology|accessdate=21 July 2012|publisher=The Economist|date=1 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/7099139?Story_ID=E1_SDJJTPJ|title=Twisted pair - Nokia and Siemens pool their network divisions to form a new firm |accessdate=21 July 2012|publisher=The Economist|date=22 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aula torcao.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Many [[tool]]s are designed to be easy to hold and use for their intended purpose. For example, a [[screwdriver]] typically has a handle with rounded edges and a grippable surface, to make it easier for the user to hold the handle and twist it to drive a screw.]]
'''Usability''' is the ease of use and learnability of a human-made object such as a tool or device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/usability |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216012223/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/usability |archivedate=2015-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[software engineering]], '''usability''' is the degree to which a software can be used by specified consumers to achieve quantified objectives with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a quantified context of use.&lt;ref&gt;Ergonomic Requirements for Office Work with Visual Display Terminals, ISO 9241-11, ISO, Geneva, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The object of use can be a [[software application]], website, [[book]], [[tool]], [[machine]], process, [[vehicle]], or anything a human interacts with. A usability study may be conducted as a primary job function by a ''usability analyst'' or as a secondary job function by [[designer]]s, [[technical writer]]s, marketing personnel, and others. It is widely used in [[consumer electronics]], [[communication]], and [[knowledge transfer]] objects (such as a cookbook, a document or [[online help]]) and [[machine|mechanical]] objects such as a door handle or a hammer.

Usability includes methods of [[measurement|measuring]] usability, such as [[needs analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Karwowski|editor1-first=W.|editor2-last=Soares|editor2-first=M.M.|editor3-last=Stanton|editor3-first=N.A.|title=Human Factors and Ergonomics in Consumer Product Design: Methods and Techniques (Handbook of Human Factors in Consumer Product Design)|chapter=Needs Analysis: Or, How Do You Capture, Represent, and Validate User Requirements in a Formal Manner/Notation before Design|first=K Tara|last=Smith|publisher=CRC Press|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the study of the principles behind an object's perceived efficiency or elegance. In [[human-computer interaction]] and [[computer science]], usability studies the elegance and clarity with which the [[interaction]] with a computer program or a web site ([[web usability]]) is designed. Usability considers [[Computer user satisfaction|user satisfaction]] and utility as quality components, and aims to improve [[User Experience|user experience]] through [[iterative design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nielsen|first1=Jakob|authorlink1=Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|title=Usability 101: Introduction to Usability|url=https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/|publisher=[[Nielsen Norman Group]]|accessdate=7 August 2016|date=4 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901213207/https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/|archivedate=1 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
The primary notion of usability is that an object designed with a generalized users' [[psychology]] and [[physiology]] in mind is, for example:
* More efficient to use&amp;mdash;takes less time to accomplish a particular task
* Easier to learn&amp;mdash;operation can be learned by observing the object
* More satisfying to use

Complex computer systems find their way into everyday life, and at the same time the market is saturated with competing [[brand]]s. This has made usability more popular and widely recognized in recent years, as companies see the benefits of researching and developing their products with user-oriented methods instead of [[technology]]-oriented methods. By understanding and researching the [[interaction]] between product and user, the ''usability expert'' can also provide insight that is unattainable by traditional company-oriented [[market research]]. For example, after observing and interviewing users, the usability expert may identify needed functionality or design flaws that were not anticipated. A method called ''[[contextual inquiry]]'' does this in the naturally occurring context of the users own environment. In the [[user-centered design]] [[paradigm]], the product is designed with its intended users in mind at all times. In the user-driven or [[participatory design]] paradigm, some of the users become actual or [[de facto]] members of the design team.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''user friendly'' is often used as a synonym for ''usable'', though it may also refer to [[accessibility]]. Usability describes the quality of user experience across websites, software, products, and environments. There is no consensus about the relation of the terms [[ergonomic]]s (or [[human factors]]) and usability. Some think of usability as the [[computer software|software]] specialization of the larger topic of ergonomics. Others view these topics as tangential, with ergonomics focusing on physiological matters (e.g., turning a door handle) and usability focusing on psychological matters (e.g., recognizing that a door can be opened by turning its handle). Usability is also important in website development ([[web usability]]). According to [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]], "Studies of user behavior on the Web find a low tolerance for difficult designs or slow sites. People don't want to wait. And they don't want to learn how to use a home page. There's no such thing as a training class or a manual for a Web site. People have to be able to grasp the functioning of the site immediately after scanning the home page&amp;mdash;for a few seconds at most."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Jakob|last1=Nielsen|first2=Donald A.|last2=Norman|title=Web-Site Usability: Usability On The Web Isn't A Luxury|url=http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/usability_is_not_a_l.html|work=JND.org|date=14 January 2000|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328002844/http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/usability_is_not_a_l.html|archivedate=28 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, most casual users simply leave the site and browse or shop elsewhere.

==Definition==
[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] defines usability as "The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use." The word "usability" also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process. Usability consultant [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]] and computer science professor [[Ben Shneiderman]] have written (separately) about a framework of system acceptability, where usability is a part of "usefulness" and is composed of:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030825.html Usability 101: Introduction to Usability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408184029/http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030825.html |date=2011-04-08 }}, Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox. Retrieved 2010-06-01&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Learnability]]: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?
* Efficiency: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
* Memorability: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they re-establish proficiency?
* Errors: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?
* Satisfaction: How pleasant is it to use the design?

Usability is often associated with the functionalities of the product (cf. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] definition, below), in addition to being solely a characteristic of the user interface (cf. framework of system acceptability, also below, which separates ''usefulness'' into ''usability'' and ''utility''). For example, in the context of mainstream consumer products, an automobile lacking a reverse gear could be considered ''unusable'' according to the former view, and ''lacking in utility'' according to the latter view. When evaluating user interfaces for usability, the definition can be as simple as "the perception of a target user of the effectiveness (fit for purpose) and efficiency (work or time required to use) of the Interface"{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}. Each component may be measured subjectively against criteria, e.g., Principles of User Interface Design, to provide a metric, often expressed as a percentage. It is important to distinguish between usability testing and usability engineering. [[Usability testing]] is the measurement of ease of use of a product or piece of software. In contrast, [[usability engineering]] (UE) is the research and design process that ensures a product with good usability. Usability is a [[non-functional requirement]]. As with other non-functional requirements, usability cannot be directly measured but must be quantified by means of indirect measures or attributes such as, for example, the number of reported problems with ease-of-use of a system.

===Intuitive interfaces===
{{see also|Natural user interface}}
The term [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] is often listed as a desirable trait in usable interfaces, often used as a synonym for [[learnability|learnable]]. Some experts such as [[Jef Raskin]] have discouraged using this term in user interface design, claiming that easy to use interfaces are often easy because of the user's exposure to previous similar systems, thus the term 'familiar' should be preferred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asktog.com/papers/raskinintuit.html Intuitive equals familiar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005202036/http://www.asktog.com/papers/raskinintuit.html |date=2009-10-05 }}, Communications of the ACM. 37:9, September 1994, pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example: Two vertical lines "||" on media player buttons do not intuitively mean "pause"&amp;mdash;they do so by convention. Aiming for "intuitive" interfaces (based on reusing existing skills with interaction systems) could lead designers to discard a better design solution only because it would require a novel approach. This position is sometimes illustrated with the remark that "The only intuitive interface is the nipple; everything else is learned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/2002/08/nipple.html |title=The Only Intuitive Interface Is The Nipple |publisher=Greenend.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130131229/http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/2002/08/nipple.html |archivedate=2012-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Tognazzini]] even denies the existence of "intuitive" interfaces, since such interfaces must be able to intuit, i.e., "perceive the patterns of the user's behavior and draw inferences."&lt;ref&gt;Tognazzini, B. (1992). ''Tog on Interface''. Boston, MA: Addison-Wesley, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he advocates the term "intuitable," i.e., "that users could intuit the workings of an application by seeing it and using it." He continues, however, "But even that is a less than useful goal since only 25 percent of the population depends on intuition to perceive anything."

==ISO standards==

===ISO/TR 16982:2002 standard===
ISO/TR 16982:2002 ("[[Ergonomics]] of human-system interaction&amp;mdash;Usability methods supporting human-centered design") is an [[International Standards Organization]] (ISO) standard that provides information on human-centered usability methods that can be used for design and evaluation. It details the advantages, disadvantages, and other factors relevant to using each usability method. It explains the implications of the stage of the life cycle and the individual project characteristics for the selection of usability methods and provides examples of usability methods in context. The main users of ISO/TR 16982:2002 are [[project manager]]s. It therefore addresses technical human factors and ergonomics issues only to the extent necessary to allow managers to understand their relevance and importance in the design process as a whole. The guidance in ISO/TR 16982:2002 can be tailored for specific design situations by using the lists of issues characterizing the context of use of the product to be delivered. Selection of appropriate usability methods should also take account of the relevant life-cycle process. ISO/TR 16982:2002 is restricted to methods that are widely used by usability specialists and project managers. It does ''not'' specify the details of how to implement or carry out the usability methods described.

===ISO 9241 standard===
[[ISO 9241]] is a multi-part standard that covers a number of aspects of people working with computers. Although originally titled ''Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs)'', it has been retitled to the more generic ''Ergonomics of Human System Interaction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=16873 | title=ISO 9241 | date=1992 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112171656/http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=16873 | archivedate=2012-01-12 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this change, ISO is renumbering some parts of the standard so that it can cover more topics, e.g. tactile and haptic interaction. The first part to be renumbered was part 10 in 2006, now part 110.&lt;ref name="ISO9241-10_1996"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=16882|publisher = International Organization for Standardization|title = ISO 9241-10:1996|accessdate = 22 July 2011|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726195756/http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=16882|archivedate = 26 July 2011|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designing for usability==
{{see also|Usability engineering}}

Any system or device designed for use by people should be easy to use, easy to learn, easy to remember (the instructions), and helpful to users. John Gould and Clayton Lewis recommend that designers striving for usability follow these three design principles&lt;ref name="Gould, J.D. 1985"&gt;Gould, J.D., Lewis, C.: "Designing for Usability: Key Principles and What Designers Think", ''Communications of the ACM'', March 1985, 28(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Early focus on [[end user]]s and the tasks they need the system/device to do
* Empirical measurement using quantitative or qualitative measures
* Iterative design, in which the designers work in a series of stages, improving the design each time

===Early focus on users and tasks===
The design team should be user-driven and it should be in direct contact with potential users. Several [[#Evaluation methods|evaluation methods]], including [[persona]]s, [[cognitive modeling]], inspection, inquiry, [[prototyping]], and testing methods may contribute to understanding potential users and their perceptions of how well the product or process works. Usability considerations, such as who the users are and their experience with similar systems must be examined. As part of understanding users, this knowledge must "...be played against the tasks that the users will be expected to perform."&lt;ref name="Gould, J.D. 1985"/&gt; This includes the analysis of what tasks the users will perform, which are most important, and what decisions the users will make while using your system. Designers must understand how cognitive and emotional characteristics of users will relate to a proposed system. One way to stress the importance of these issues in the designers' minds is to use personas, which are made-up representative users. See below for further discussion of personas. Another more expensive but more insightful method is to have a panel of potential users work closely with the design team from the early stages.&lt;ref name="pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca"&gt;[http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~saul/wiki/uploads/HCIPapers/gould-howto-2-pageperside-ocr.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127084949/http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~saul/wiki/uploads/HCIPapers/gould-howto-2-pageperside-ocr.pdf |date=November 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empirical measurement===
Test the system early on, and test the system on real users using behavioral measurements. This includes testing the system for both learnability and usability. (See [[#Evaluation methods|Evaluation Methods]]). It is important in this stage to use quantitative usability specifications such as time and errors to complete tasks and number of users to test, as well as examine performance and attitudes of the users testing the system.&lt;ref name="pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca"/&gt; Finally, "reviewing or demonstrating" a system before the user tests it can result in misleading results. The emphasis of empirical measurement is on measurement, both informal and formal, which can be carried out through a variety of [[#Evaluation methods|evaluation methods]].&lt;ref name="Gould, J.D. 1985"/&gt;

===Iterative design===
[[Iterative design]] is a design methodology based on a cyclic process of prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining a product or process. Based on the results of testing the most recent iteration of a design, changes and refinements are made. This process is intended to ultimately improve the quality and functionality of a design. In iterative design, interaction with the designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving a project, as successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented. The key requirements for Iterative Design are: identification of required changes, an ability to make changes, and a willingness to make changes. When a problem is encountered, there is no set method to determine the correct solution. Rather, there are empirical methods that can be used during system development or after the system is delivered, usually a more inopportune time. Ultimately, iterative design works towards meeting goals such as making the system user friendly, easy to use, easy to operate, simple, etc.&lt;ref name="pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca"/&gt;

==Evaluation methods==
There are a variety of usability evaluation methods. Certain methods use data from users, while others rely on usability experts. There are usability evaluation methods for all stages of design and development, from product definition to final design modifications. When choosing a method, consider cost, time constraints, and appropriateness. For a brief overview of methods, see [[Comparison of usability evaluation methods]] or continue reading below. Usability methods can be further classified into the subcategories below.

===Cognitive modeling methods===
Cognitive modeling involves creating a computational model to estimate how long it takes people to perform a given task. Models are based on psychological principles and experimental studies to determine times for cognitive processing and motor movements. Cognitive models can be used to improve user interfaces or predict problem errors and pitfalls during the design process. A few examples of cognitive models include:

;Parallel design
With parallel design, several people create an initial design from the same set of requirements. Each person works independently, and when finished, shares concepts with the group. The design team considers each solution, and each designer uses the best ideas to further improve their own solution. This process helps generate many different, diverse ideas, and ensures that the best ideas from each design are integrated into the final concept. This process can be repeated several times until the team is satisfied with the final concept.

;GOMS
{{main|GOMS}}
''GOMS'' stands for ''goals, operator, methods, and selection rules''. It is a family of techniques that analyzes the user complexity of interactive systems. Goals are what the user must accomplish. An operator is an action performed in pursuit of a goal. A method is a sequence of operators that accomplish a goal. Selection rules specify which method satisfies a given goal, based on context.

;Human processor model
{{main|Human processor model}}
Sometimes it is useful to break a task down and analyze each individual aspect separately. This helps the tester locate specific areas for improvement. To do this, it is necessary to understand how the human brain processes information. A model of the human processor is shown below.

[[File:HumanProcessorModel.jpg]]

Many studies have been done to estimate the cycle times, decay times, and capacities of each of these processors. Variables that affect these can include subject age, [[aptitude]]s, ability, and the surrounding environment. For a younger adult, reasonable estimates are:

Long-term memory is believed to have an infinite capacity and decay time.&lt;ref&gt;Card, S.K., Moran, T.P., &amp; Newell, A. (1983). ''The psychology of human-computer interaction''. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Keystroke level modeling
{{main|Keystroke level model}}
Keystroke level modeling is essentially a less comprehensive version of GOMS that makes simplifying assumptions in order to reduce calculation time and complexity.

===Inspection methods===
{{main|Usability inspection}}
These usability evaluation methods involve observation of users by an experimenter, or the testing and evaluation of a program by an expert reviewer. They provide more quantitative data as tasks can be timed and recorded.

;Card sorts
[[Card sorting]] is a way to involve users in grouping information for a website's usability review. Participants in a card sorting session are asked to organize the content from a Web site in a way that makes sense to them. Participants review items from a Web site and then group these items into categories. Card sorting helps to learn how users think about the content and how they would organize the information on the Web site. Card sorting helps to build the structure for a Web site, decide what to put on the home page, and label the home page categories. It also helps to ensure that information is organized on the site in a way that is logical to users.

;Tree tests
[[Tree testing (information architecture)|Tree testing]] is a way to evaluate the effectiveness of a website's top-down organization. Participants are given "find it" tasks, then asked to drill down through successive text lists of topics and subtopics to find a suitable answer. Tree testing evaluates the [[findability]] and labeling of topics in a site, separate from its navigation controls or [[visual design]].

;Ethnography
[[Ethnographic]] analysis is derived from anthropology. Field observations are taken at a site of a possible user, which track the artifacts of work such as Post-It notes, items on desktop, shortcuts, and items in trash bins. These observations also gather the sequence of work and interruptions that determine the user's typical day.

;Heuristic evaluation
[[Heuristic evaluation]] is a usability engineering method for finding and assessing usability problems in a user interface design as part of an iterative design process. It involves having a small set of evaluators examining the interface and using recognized usability principles (the "heuristics"). It is the most popular of the usability inspection methods, as it is quick, cheap, and easy. Heuristic evaluation was developed to aid in the design of computer user-interface design. It relies on expert reviewers to discover usability problems and then categorize and rate them by a set of principles (heuristics.) It is widely used based on its speed and cost-effectiveness. Jakob Nielsen's list of ten heuristics is the most commonly used in industry. These are ten general principles for user interface design. They are called "heuristics" because they are more in the nature of rules of thumb than specific usability guidelines.
*''Visibility of system status'': The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.
*''Match between system and the real world'': The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
*''User control and freedom'': Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
*''Consistency and standards'': Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.
*''Error prevention'': Even better than good error messages is a careful design that prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
*''[[Recognition memory|Recognition]] rather than [[Recall (memory)|recall]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/|title=Memory Recognition and Recall in User Interfaces|website=www.nngroup.com|access-date=2017-01-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105083720/https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/|archivedate=2017-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
*''Flexibility and efficiency of use'': Accelerators&amp;mdash;unseen by the novice user&amp;mdash;may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
*''Aesthetic and minimalist design'': Dialogues should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.
*''Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors'': Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
*''Help and documentation'': Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

Thus, by determining which guidelines are violated, the usability of a device can be determined.

;Usability inspection
[[Usability inspection]] is a review of a system based on a set of guidelines. The review is conducted by a group of experts who are deeply familiar with the concepts of usability in design. The experts focus on a list of areas in design that have been shown to be troublesome for users.

;Pluralistic inspection
Pluralistic Inspections are meetings where users, developers, and human factors people meet together to discuss and evaluate step by step of a task scenario. As more people inspect the scenario for problems, the higher the probability to find problems. In addition, the more interaction in the team, the faster the usability issues are resolved.

;Consistency inspection
In consistency inspection, expert designers review products or projects to ensure consistency across multiple products to look if it does things in the same way as their own designs.

;Activity Analysis
Activity analysis is a usability method used in preliminary stages of development to get a sense of situation. It involves an investigator observing users as they work in the field. Also referred to as user observation, it is useful for specifying user requirements and studying currently used tasks and subtasks. The data collected are qualitative and useful for defining the problem. It should be used when you wish to frame what is needed, or "What do we want to know?"

===Inquiry methods===
The following usability evaluation methods involve collecting qualitative data from users. Although the data collected is subjective, it provides valuable information on what the user wants.

;Task analysis
Task analysis means learning about users' goals and users' ways of working. Task analysis can also mean figuring out what more specific tasks users must do to meet those goals and what steps they must take to accomplish those tasks. Along with user and task analysis, a third analysis is often used: understanding users' environments (physical, social, cultural, and technological environments).

;Focus groups
A focus group is a focused discussion where a moderator leads a group of participants through a set of questions on a particular topic. Although typically used as a marketing tool, [[Focus Groups]] are sometimes used to evaluate usability. Used in the product definition stage, a group of 6 to 10 users are gathered to discuss what they desire in a product. An experienced focus group facilitator is hired to guide the discussion to areas of interest for the developers. Focus groups are typically videotaped to help get verbatim quotes, and clips are often used to summarize opinions. The data gathered is not usually quantitative, but can help get an idea of a target group's opinion.

;Questionnaires/surveys
[[Statistical survey|Surveys]] have the advantages of being inexpensive, require no testing equipment, and results reflect the users' opinions. When written carefully and given to actual users who have experience with the product and knowledge of design, surveys provide useful feedback on the strong and weak areas of the usability of a design. This is a very common method and often does not appear to be a survey, but just a warranty card.

===Prototyping methods===
It is often very difficult for designers to conduct usability tests with the exact system being designed. Cost constraints, size, and design constraints usually lead the designer to creating a prototype of the system. Instead of creating the complete final system, the designer may test different sections of the system, thus making several small models of each component of the system. The types of usability prototypes may vary from using paper models, index cards, hand drawn models, or storyboards.&lt;ref name=wickens /&gt; Prototypes are able to be modified quickly, often are faster and easier to create with less time invested by designers and are more apt to change design; although sometimes are not an adequate representation of the whole system, are often not durable and testing results may not be parallel to those of the actual system.

;Rapid prototyping
Rapid prototyping is a method used in early stages of development to validate and refine the usability of a system. It can be used to quickly and cheaply evaluate user-interface designs without the need for an expensive working model. This can help remove hesitation to change the design, since it is implemented before any real programming begins. One such method of rapid prototyping is [[paper prototyping]].

===Testing methods===
{{main|Usability testing}}
These usability evaluation methods involve testing of subjects for the most quantitative data. Usually recorded on video, they provide task completion time and allow for observation of attitude. Regardless to how carefully a system is designed, all theories must be tested using usability tests. Usability tests involve typical users using the system (or product) in a realistic environment [see [[simulation]]]. Observation of the user's behavior, emotions, and difficulties while performing different tasks, often identify areas of improvement for the system.

====Metrics====
While conducting usability tests, designers must use usability metrics to identify what it is they are going to measure, or the usability metrics. These metrics are often variable, and change in conjunction with the scope and goals of the project. The number of subjects being tested can also affect usability metrics, as it is often easier to focus on specific demographics. Qualitative design phases, such as general usability (can the task be accomplished?), and user satisfaction are also typically done with smaller groups of subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Dumas, J.S. and Redish, J.C. (1999). ''A Practical Guide to Usability Testing'' (revised ed.), Bristol, U.K.: Intellect Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Using inexpensive prototypes on small user groups provides more detailed information, because of the more interactive atmosphere, and the designer's ability to focus more on the individual user.

As the designs become more complex, the testing must become more formalized. Testing equipment will become more sophisticated and testing metrics become more quantitative. With a more refined prototype, designers often test effectiveness, efficiency, and subjective satisfaction, by asking the user to complete various tasks. These categories are measured by the percent that complete the task, how long it takes to complete the tasks, ratios of success to failure to complete the task, time spent on errors, the number of errors, rating scale of satisfactions, number of times user seems frustrated, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Kuniavsky, M. (2003). ''Observing the User Experience: A Practitioner's Guide to User Research'', San Francisco, CA: Morgan Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional observations of the users give designers insight on navigation difficulties, controls, conceptual models, etc. The ultimate goal of analyzing these metrics is to find/create a prototype design that users like and use to successfully perform given tasks.&lt;ref name=wickens&gt;Wickens, C.D et al. (2004). ''An Introduction to Human Factors Engineering'' (2nd Ed), Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ : Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; After conducting usability tests, it is important for a designer to record what was observed, in addition to why such behavior occurred and modify the model according to the results. Often it is quite difficult to distinguish the source of the design errors, and what the user did wrong. However, effective usability tests will not generate a solution to the problems, but provide modified design guidelines for continued testing.

;Remote usability testing
Remote usability testing (also known as unmoderated or asynchronous usability testing) involves the use of a specially modified online survey, allowing the quantification of user testing studies by providing the ability to generate large sample sizes, or a deep qualitative analysis without the need for dedicated facilities. Additionally, this style of user testing also provides an opportunity to segment feedback by demographic, attitudinal and behavioral type. The tests are carried out in the user's own environment (rather than labs) helping further simulate real-life scenario testing. This approach also provides a vehicle to easily solicit feedback from users in remote areas. There are two types, quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative use large sample sized and task based surveys. These types of studies are useful for validating suspected usability issues. Qualitative studies are best used as exploratory research, in small sample sizes but frequent, even daily iterations. Qualitative usually allows for observing respondent's screens and verbal think aloud commentary (Screen Recording Video, SRV), and for a richer level of insight also include the webcam view of the respondent (Video-in-Video, ViV, sometimes referred to as Picture-in-Picture, PiP)

;Remote usability testing for mobile devices
The growth in mobile and associated platforms and services (e.g.: Mobile gaming has experienced 20x growth in 2010-2012) has generated a need for unmoderated remote usability testing on mobile devices, both for websites but especially for app interactions. One methodology consists of shipping cameras and special camera holding fixtures to dedicated testers, and having them record the screens of the mobile smart-phone or tablet device, usually using an HD camera. A drawback of this approach is that the finger movements of the respondent can obscure the view of the screen, in addition to the bias and logistical issues inherent in shipping special hardware to selected respondents. A newer approach uses a wireless projection of the mobile device screen onto the computer desktop screen of the respondent, who can then be recorded through their webcam, and thus a combined Video-in-Video view of the participant and the screen interactions viewed simultaneously while incorporating the verbal think aloud commentary of the respondents.

;Thinking aloud
The [[Think aloud protocol]] is a method of gathering data that is used in both usability and psychology studies. It involves getting a user to verbalize their thought processes as they perform a task or set of tasks. Often an instructor is present to prompt the user into being more vocal as they work. Similar to the Subjects-in-Tandem method, it is useful in pinpointing problems and is relatively simple to set up. Additionally, it can provide insight into the user's attitude, which can not usually be discerned from a survey or questionnaire.

;[[RITE method]]
Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation (RITE)&lt;ref&gt;Medlock, M.C., Wixon, D., Terrano, M., Romero, R., and Fulton, B. (2002). Using the RITE method to improve products: A definition and a case study. Presented at the Usability Professionsals Association 2002, Orlando FL.&lt;/ref&gt; is an iterative usability method similar to traditional "discount" usability testing. The tester and team must define a target population for testing, schedule participants to come into the lab, decide on how the users behaviors will be measured, construct a test script and have participants engage in a verbal protocol (e.g., think aloud). However it differs from these methods in that it advocates that changes to the user interface are made as soon as a problem is identified and a solution is clear. Sometimes this can occur after observing as few as 1 participant. Once the data for a participant has been collected the usability engineer and team decide if they will be making any changes to the prototype prior to the next participant. The changed interface is then tested with the remaining users.

;Subjects-in-tandem or co-discovery
Subjects-in-tandem (also called co-discovery) is the pairing of subjects in a usability test to gather important information on the ease of use of a product. Subjects tend to discuss the tasks they have to accomplish out loud and through these discussions observers learn where the problem areas of a design are. To encourage co-operative problem-solving between the two subjects, and the attendant discussions leading to it, the tests can be designed to make the subjects dependent on each other by assigning them complementary areas of responsibility (e.g. for testing of software, one subject may be put in charge of the mouse and the other of the keyboard.)

;Component-based usability testing
[[Component-Based Usability Testing|Component-based usability testing]] is an approach which aims to test the usability of elementary units of an interaction system, referred to as interaction components. The approach includes component-specific quantitative measures based on user interaction recorded in log files, and component-based usability questionnaires.

===Other methods===
;Cognitive walk through
[[Cognitive walkthrough]] is a method of evaluating the user interaction of a working prototype or final product. It is used to evaluate the system's ease of learning. Cognitive walk through is useful to understand the user's thought processes and decision making when interacting with a system, specially for first-time or infrequent users.

;Benchmarking
[[Benchmarking]] creates standardized test materials for a specific type of design. Four key characteristics are considered when establishing a benchmark: time to do the core task, time to fix errors, time to learn applications, and the functionality of the system. Once there is a benchmark, other designs can be compared to it to determine the usability of the system. Many of the common objectives of usability studies, such as trying to understand user behavior or exploring alternative designs, must be put aside. Unlike many other usability methods or types of labs studies, benchmark studies more closely resemble true experimental psychology lab studies, with greater attention to detail on methodology, study protocol and data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/27-the-art-of-usability-benchmarking/ |title=#27 – The art of usability benchmarking |publisher=Scottberkun.com |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104042915/http://scottberkun.com/essays/27-the-art-of-usability-benchmarking/ |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Meta-analysis
[[Meta-analysis]] is a statistical procedure to combine results across studies to integrate the findings. This phrase was coined in 1976 as a [[Numerical data|quantitative]] literature review. This type of evaluation is very powerful for determining the usability of a device because it combines multiple studies to provide very accurate quantitative support.

;Persona
[[Persona (marketing)|Personas]] are fictitious characters created to represent a site or product's different user types and their associated demographics and technographics. [[Alan Cooper]] introduced the concept of using personas as a part of interactive design in 1998 in his book ''The Inmates Are Running the Asylum'',&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, A. (1999). ''The Inmates Are Running the Asylum'', Sams Publishers, {{ISBN|0-672-31649-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had used this concept since as early as 1975. Personas are a usability evaluation method that can be used at various design stages. The most typical time to create personas is at the beginning of designing so that designers have a tangible idea of who the users of their product will be. Personas are the [[archetypes]] that represent actual groups of users and their needs, which can be a general description of person, context, or usage scenario. This technique turns marketing data on target user population into a few physical concepts of users to create empathy among the design team, with the final aim of tailoring a product more closely to how the personas will use it. To gather the [[marketing]] data that personas require, several tools can be used, including online surveys, [[web analytics]], customer feedback forms, and usability tests, and interviews with customer-service representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seoroi.com/case-studies/4-5-personas-of-my-seo-site/ |title=How I Built 4 Personas For My SEO Site |publisher=Seoroi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103061740/http://seoroi.com/case-studies/4-5-personas-of-my-seo-site/ |archivedate=2013-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits ==
The key benefits of usability are:
* Higher revenues through increased sales
* Increased user efficiency and user satisfaction
* Reduced development costs
* Reduced support costs

===Corporate integration===
An increase in usability generally positively affects several facets of a company's output quality. In particular, the benefits fall into several common areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usabilityprofessionals.org/usability_resources/usability_in_the_real_world/benefits_of_usability.html |title=Usability Resources: Usability in the Real World: Business Benefits |publisher=Usabilityprofessionals.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031154914/http://www.usabilityprofessionals.org/usability_resources/usability_in_the_real_world/benefits_of_usability.html |archivedate=2013-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increased productivity
* Decreased training and support costs
* Increased sales and revenues
* Reduced development time and costs
* Reduced maintenance costs
* Increased customer satisfaction

Increased usability in the workplace fosters several responses from employees: "Workers who enjoy their work do it better, stay longer in the face of temptation, and contribute ideas and enthusiasm to the evolution of enhanced productivity."&lt;ref&gt;Landauer, T. K. (1996). ''The trouble with computers''. Cambridge, MA, The MIT Press. p158.&lt;/ref&gt; To create standards, companies often implement experimental design techniques that create baseline levels. Areas of concern in an office environment include (though are not necessarily limited to):&lt;ref&gt;McKeown, Celine (2008). ''Office ergonomics: practical applications''. Boca Raton, FL, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Working posture
* Design of workstation furniture
* Screen displays
* Input devices
* Organization issues
* Office environment
* Software interface

By working to improve said factors, corporations can achieve their goals of increased output at lower costs, while potentially creating optimal levels of customer satisfaction. There are numerous reasons why each of these factors correlates to overall improvement. For example, making software user interfaces easier to understand reduces the need for extensive training. The improved interface tends to lower the time needed to perform tasks, and so would both raise the productivity levels for employees and reduce development time (and thus costs). Each of the aforementioned factors are not mutually exclusive; rather they should be understood to work in conjunction to form the overall workplace environment. In the 2010s, usability is recognized as an important software quality attribute, earning its place among more traditional attributes such as [[Performance (disambiguation)|performance]][[Robustness (computer science)|, robustness]] and aesthetic appearance. Various academic programs focus on usability.&lt;ref&gt;{{dmoz|Computers/Human-Computer_Interaction/Academic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several usability [[Information technology consulting|consultancy]] companies have emerged, and traditional consultancy and design firms offer similar services.

There is some resistance to integrating usability work in organisations. Usability is seen as a vague concept, it is difficult to measure and other areas are prioritised when IT projects run out of time or money.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=1971-|first=Cajander, Åsa, |title=Usability - who cares? : the introduction of user-centred systems design in organisations |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/652387306 |date=2010 |publisher=Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis |isbn=9789155477974 |oclc=652387306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional development==
Usability practitioners are sometimes trained as industrial engineers, psychologists, [[kinesiology|kinesiologists]], systems design engineers, or with a degree in information architecture, information or library science, or [[Human–computer interaction|Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)]]. More often though they are people who are trained in specific applied fields who have taken on a usability focus within their organization. Anyone who aims to make tools easier to use and more effective for their desired function within the context of work or everyday living can benefit from studying usability principles and guidelines. For those seeking to extend their training, the [[Usability Professionals' Association]] offers online resources, reference lists, courses, conferences, and local chapter meetings. The UPA also sponsors [[World Usability Day]] each November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usabilityprofessionals.org/ |title=UXPA - The User Experience Professionals Association |publisher=Usabilityprofessionals.org |date=2013-03-31 |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021162845/http://www.usabilityprofessionals.org/ |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Related professional organizations include the [[Human Factors and Ergonomics Society]] (HFES) and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s special interest groups in Computer Human Interaction ([[SIGCHI]]), Design of Communication ([[SIGDOC]]) and Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques ([[ACM SIGGRAPH|SIGGRAPH]]). The [[Society for Technical Communication]] also has a special interest group on Usability and User Experience (UUX). They publish a quarterly newsletter called ''Usability Interface''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stcsig.org/usability/newsletter/index.html |title=STC Usability Interface - Newsletter Home Page |publisher=Stcsig.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023092907/http://www.stcsig.org/usability/newsletter/index.html |archivedate=2013-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''watering can''' (or '''watering pot''') is a portable container, usually with a handle and a spout, used to water plants by hand. It has been in use since at least 79 A.D. and has since seen many improvements in design. Apart from watering plants, it has varied uses, as it is a fairly versatile tool.

The capacity of the container can be anywhere from 0.5 litres (for indoor household plants) to 10 litres (for general garden use). It is usually made of [[metal]], [[ceramic]] or [[plastic]]. At the end of the spout, a "rose" (a device, like a cap, with small holes) can be placed to break up the stream of water into droplets, to avoid excessive water pressure on the soil or on delicate plants.

== History ==

The term "watering can" first appeared in the 1000s
.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=watering&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 First appearance of "Watering-can" — Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, it had been known as a "watering pot". 

In 1886 the "Haws" watering can was patented by John Haws. The patent read "This new invention forms a watering pot that is much easier to carry and tip, and at the same time being much cleaner, and more adapted for use than any other put before the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://haws.co.uk/pages/130-years-of-haws|title= 130 Years of Haws|publisher=Haws Elliott Ltd|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern uses ==

Watering cans are used by gardeners for watering plants by road workers to apply [[Asphalt|bitumen to asphalt]], as ornaments, and regularly in symbolic art pieces.
