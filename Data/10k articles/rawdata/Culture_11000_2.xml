===Assailant===
The attacker was identified as 21-year-old Bashar Masalha, who was from the city of [[Qalqilya]] located in the [[Palestinian territories]]. He was residing in Israel illegally.&lt;ref name="illegal"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Shira|title=Terror Wave in Israel Claims American Tourist|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/08/terror-wave-in-israel-claims-us-tourist.html|accessdate=9 March 2016|publisher=Daily Beast|date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family of the murderer receives a monthly pension from the [[Palestinian Authority Martyr's Fund]] equal to several times the average monthly wage in the Palestinian Territories.&lt;ref name="WSJEditorial"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pay for Slay in Palestine U.S. aid becomes a transfer payment for terrorists|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/pay-for-slay-in-palestine-1490653597|accessdate=8 June 2017|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) announced on the night of the attacks that it was imposing closures on the West Bank villages of [[Zawiya, Jenin|Zawiya]] and [[Al-Auja, Jericho|Al-Auja]], the hometowns of two of the attackers.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nir|first1=Hasson|last2=Yaron|first2=Lee|last3=Cohen|first3=Gili|title=Terror Rampage Leaves One Dead, at Least 13 Wounded Across Israel|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.707689|access-date=23 March 2016|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the attack and the two other attacks, Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] held security consultations with Israeli Defense Minister [[Moshe Ya'alon]], Internal Security Minister [[Gilad Erdan]], police chief [[Roni Alsheikh]] and [[Israeli Defence Forces|IDF]] and [[Shin Bet]] officials. The Prime Minister's Office said it was immediately decided to close gaps in the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|separation barrier]] in the Jerusalem area, and to complete construction of the barrier in the [[Tarqumiyah]] area in the [[South Hebron Hills]]. It was also decided to close Palestinian media outlets accused of incitement. Professionals in the defense establishment will decide which Palestinian media will be closed. Further, it was decided to deny work permits for family members of assailants.&lt;ref name="RavidSecurityBarrier"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ravid|first1=Barak|title=After Terror Attacks, Israel to Complete Separation Barrier Construction Around Jerusalem, Southern West Bank |url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.707775|accessdate=11 March 2016|publisher=Haaretz|date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReedSecurityCrackdown"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reed|first1=John|title=Israel in security crackdown after attacks|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3ce5036a-e76f-11e5-bc31-138df2ae9ee6.html#axzz42WTHsV6y|accessdate=11 March 2016|publisher=Financial Times|date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli police began a law enforcement operation to crack down on Palestinian illegal residents, arresting more than 250 illegal Arabs across the country, but focused on construction sites and large shopping areas, which normally are magnets for cheap, cash-in-the-hand labor. The arresting officers discovered a small compound, complete with sleeping tents, showers, a lavatory and a kitchen, which illegal Arab workers had erected in HaBesor Stream in southern Israel, not far from the [[Gaza Strip]]. Police reported that 15 Israeli employers and 12 drivers were arrested by 10 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More than 250 Illegal Arab Residents Rounded Up Overnight|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/more-than-250-illegal-arab-residents-rounded-up-overnight/2016/03/10/|accessdate=23 March 2016|work=[[The Jewish Press]]|date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Knesset Internal Affairs and Environment Committee from 14 March, chaired by MK David Amsalem ([[Likud]]), out of the 73 Palestinian attacks that occurred within the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]], 27 were carried out by illegal Arab residents. Police noted that each year sees tens of thousands of cases of illegal Arab residents, who are brought before a judge when their stay involves security risks, which means that there are tens of thousands of illegal Arabs moving freely everywhere inside Israel, some of whom may be "terrorist ticking bombs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Knesset Committee Hears Illegal Residents Carried Out 44% of Attacks in ‘Green Line’ Israel|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/knesset-committee-hears-illegal-residents-carried-out-44-of-attacks-in-green-line-israel/2016/03/14/|access-date=23 March 2016|work=[[The Jewish Press]]|date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taylor Force Act==
{{main|Taylor Force Act}}
The Taylor Force Act is a legislative bill co-sponsored in the United States Senate in 2016 by U.S. Senators [[Lindsey Graham]] (R-South Carolina), [[Dan Coats]] (R-Indiana), and [[Roy Blunt]] (R-Missouri). The legislation proposes to stop American economic aid to the [[Palestinian Authority]]  until the PA changes its laws to cease paying stipends funneled through the so-called [[Palestinian Authority Martyr's Fund]] to individuals who commit acts of terrorism and to the families of deceased terrorists.&lt;ref name="CutTerrorFunding"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tubbs|first1=Ashlyn|title=Senators introduce Taylor Force Act to cut terror attack funding|url=http://www.kcbd.com/story/33272315/senators-introduce-taylor-force-act-to-cut-terror-attack-funding|accessdate=15 November 2016|publisher=[[KCBD]]|date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 23, 2018 the Act was signed into law by U.S. President [[Donald Trump]].

===International===

*{{flag|United States}} Vice President [[Joe Biden]] chastised Palestinian leaders for not condemning the latest in a series of stabbing attacks targeting Israelis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1255">'''{{Lang|de|Abendmusik}}''' (German for "evening music", plural ''{{Lang|de|Abendmusiken}}'') is an evening concert, usually performed in a church.

Specifically, this designation refers to a series of performances at the [[St. Mary's Church, Lübeck]] (''{{Lang|de|Marienkirche}}''), Germany, begun in the 17th century and lasting until 1810. Paid for by local businessmen and therefore with free admission for the public, [[Franz Tunder]] ([[organist]] at the {{Lang|de|Marienkirche}} from 1641 to 1667) was the first to perform the ''{{Lang|de|Abendmusiken}}'' with [[pipe organ|organ]] music and a variety of vocal music. Under his successor [[Dieterich Buxtehude]] (organist at Lübeck from 1668 until 1707), these concerts came to prominence and were established on the five Sundays preceding [[Christmas]]. Buxtehude and his successors even composed five-part [[oratorio]]s to be performed over the course of the five Sundays.

Organist [[Walter Kraft]] (1905–1977) renewed this Lübeck tradition at St. Mary's in 1926.

[[File:2003 Davidson prijsuitreiking 1.tif|{{largethumb}}|Alan Davidson ([[Erasmus Prize]] 2003)]]
'''Alan Eaton Davidson''' [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]] (30 March 1924 – 2 December 2003) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] diplomat and historian best known for his writing and editing on food and [[gastronomy]]. He was the author of the 900-page, encyclopedic ''[[The Oxford Companion to Food]]'' (1999, second edition 2006).

==Early life==
The son of a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[tax inspector]], Davidson was born in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]]. His family travelled around the UK because of his father's job, but they eventually settled in [[Leeds]], where Davidson attended [[Leeds Grammar School]]. Davidson studied [[classical language]]s at [[Queen's College, Oxford]]. During [[World War II]], he served in the [[Royal Navy]] as an officer in the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]].

==Career==
In 1948, Davidson joined the [[British Foreign Office|Foreign Office]] and served in diplomatic posts in [[Washington DC|Washington]], [[Tunis]], [[Brussels]], [[Cairo]], [[the Hague]]; from 1973 to 1975, he was ambassador to [[Laos]]. While living in Tunis, his wife asked him to look for a cookbook on fish because she did not recognize any of the local varieties. Not being able to find one he wrote one himself together with the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Ichthyology|ichthyologist]] [[Giorgio Bini]], the world's greatest living authority on seafish in the Mediterranean at this time, who happened to be visiting. The original manuscript was copied with a stencil machine. A copy of ''Seafish Of Tunisia And The Central Mediterranean'' reached the British cooking guru [[Elizabeth David]], who passed it on to [[Penguin Books]], which published it in 1972 as ''Mediterranean Seafood''. The book has since become a standard reference work, and is characterized by its very creative mixture of biology and recipes.

This was followed by ''Seafood Of South East Asia'' (1976) and ''North Atlantic Seafood'' (1979), for which he travelled throughout the region, gathering thousands of recipes from [[Portugal]] to [[Iceland]]. He was a noted expert on [[Lao cuisine]], which he introduced to the West through his two books, ''Traditional Recipes of Laos,'' and ''Fish and Fish Dishes of Laos.''

In 1979, Davidson was Alistair Horne Research Fellow at [[St Antony's College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Levy (journalist)|Paul Levy]], ''[[Out To Lunch (Levy)|Out To Lunch]]'' (London, 1986) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year he began to edit ''[[Petits Propos Culinaires]]'', a journal of food studies and history, published by Prospect Books, which he founded in 1979 for that purpose. He also convened a symposium on food history, which grew into an annual event known since 1981 as the [[Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery]].

==Recognition==
In 2003, Davidson was awarded the [[Praemium Erasmianum Foundation]]'s [[Erasmus Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erasmusprijs.org/index.cfm?lang=en&amp;page=Prijswinnaars&amp;mode=detail&amp;itemID=D591473C-D053-C87D-015FD12602C7FDA7|title=Alan Davidson, 2003|publisher=Praemium Erasmianum Foundation|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Culinary historian Alan Davidson receives Erasmus Prize 2003|first=Anneke|last=van Otterloo|journal=Food &amp; History|volume=2|issue=2|year=2004|pages=181–182|doi=10.1484/J.FOOD.2.300102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artsakh State Historical Museum of Local Lore''' located at 1, Sasuntsi David str., [[Stepanakert]], was founded in 1939 in spite of the anti-Armenian policy of Soviet [[Azerbaijan]] and the years of war in [[Nagorno-Karabakh|Artsakh]]. The museum was able to gather and preserve all of the spiritual and material value of the Artsakh people. The museum boasts 50,000 historical-cultural artifacts, presenting the origins of birth and development of the civilization of the territory.  Today more than ever the museum has the opportunity to enrich its funds effectively thanks to the archaeological excavation conducted in Artsakh and its findings. 

Upon entering the museum the exhibition halls start off with models demonstrating Artakh's natural landscape. Further down is the hall of archeology where models of petrification, early implements of the Stone Age, different bronze subjects (utensils, weapons, adornments), preservations from times of the state of Urartu, amazing ornamented ceramic vessels, Armenian, Roman, Persian, Arabian silver and copper coins, and so on.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artsakh.travel/en/museums/47/|title=MUSEUMS - Karabakh Travel|website=artsakh.travel|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When entering the hall of the Middle Ages, the section starts off with a photo and map of the first churches in Artsakh (4th century): [[Amaras Monastery|Amaras monastery]], founded by [[Gregory the Illuminator|Gregory the illuminator]], the first Armenian Christian philosopher. There is also a documentary available at this part of the exhibit where evidences of his propagations in South Caucasus are presented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Artsakh State Museum (37512504202).jpg|thumb|An outside view of the museum. ]]
In the department of ethnography the demonstrations begins with the show-case of the Artsakhian family life. Here you could see images and a diorama of a grandmother knitting with distaff while the grandfather sews leather footwear. There is also the old carpet weaving loom and the samples of Artsakh weaving art- carpets of 18-20 cc. In 19c. the center of the Armenian national culture was [[Shoushi]] city; of it the old gospel, printed books and photos tell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://barevarmenia.com/en/armenian_culture/sight156|title=Historical-Geological Museum of Artsakh {{!}} Barev Armenia Tours|last=Tours|first=Barev Armenia|website=barevarmenia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The halls of modern history are rich in documentary artifacts where exhibits telling about the national liberation fight of Artsakhian Armenians against Azerbaijan in 1918–21 are demonstrated. Here the map of Armenia of 1926 is presented, fulfilled on the basis of the union treaty of the 10th of August, 1920, as well as documents confirming the tragic events in Shoushi on the 23d of March, 1920, and telling about the forced annexation of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] to the Soviet Azerbaijan.

The last halls of the museum tell about the modern movement of Artsakh, national-liberation war, about the solidarity of the whole Armenian nation in post-war period with the aims of consolidation of the Republic of Nagorno Karabakh.

There is a small gift shop in the museum, where one can buy booklets, books and photo albums dedicated to Artsakhakh. The museum works every day and is closed on Sundays.

'''In mythology, the bee''', found in Indian, [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]] cultures, was believed to be the sacred insect that bridged the natural world to the underworld.

==Worship==

The [[bee]] was an emblem of [[Potnia]], the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]-[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] "Mistress", also referred to as "The Pure Mother Bee".&lt;ref name=elderkin&gt;G.W. Elderkin (1939) "The Bee of Artemis"''The American Journal of Philology'' '''60''' pp. 203-213&lt;/ref&gt; Her priestesses received the name of "[[Melissa]]" ("bee").&lt;ref&gt;Neustadt, Ernst 1906. ''[https://archive.org/details/dejovecretico00unkngoog De Jove cretico]'', (dissertation, Berlin). Chapter III "de Melissa dea" discusses bee-goddesses and bee-priestesses in Crete.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, priestesses worshipping [[Artemis]] and [[Demeter]] were called "Bees".&lt;ref name="Harrison 1922:442"&gt;Harrison 1922:442.&lt;/ref&gt; Appearing in tomb decorations, Mycenaean [[Beehive tomb|tholos tombs]] were shaped as beehives. The Delphic priestess is often referred to as a bee, and [[Pindar]] notes that she remained "the Delphic bee" long after [[Apollo]] had usurped the ancient oracle and shrine. "The Delphic priestess in historical times chewed a laurel leaf," Harrison noted, "but when she was a Bee surely she must have sought her inspiration in the honeycomb."&lt;ref name="Harrison 1922:442"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Melissa Delphis'', according to [[Pindar]]'s Fourth Pythian Ode, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myth==
The [[Homeric Hymn]] to Apollo acknowledges that Apollo's gift of prophecy first came to him from three bee maidens, usually but doubtfully identified with the [[Thriae]], a [[trinity]] of pre-Hellenic Aegean bee goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;Scheinberg, Susan 1979. "The Bee Maidens of the Homeric Hymn to Hermes". ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' '''83'''(1979), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–28.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of identical embossed gold plaques were recovered at Camiros in [[Rhodes]];&lt;ref&gt;One was illustrated in a line drawing in Harrison 1922:443, fig 135&lt;/ref&gt; they date from the archaic period of Greek art in the seventh century, but the winged bee goddesses they depict must be far older.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;Cook, Arthur Bernard. "The bee in Greek mythology" 1895 ''Journal of the Hellenic Society'' '''15''' pages 1-24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kalahari Desert's [[Bushmen|San people]] tell of a bee that carried a mantis across a river. The exhausted bee left the mantis on a floating flower but planted a seed in the mantis's body before it died. The seed grew to become the first human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chrigi-in-Africa|title=The First Bushman / San|url=http://www.gateway-africa.com/stories/The_First_Bushman_San.html|publisher=Gateway Africa|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Egyptian mythology]], bees grew from the tears of the sun god Ra when they landed on the desert sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Norton|first1=Holly|title=Honey, I love you: our 40,000-year relationship with the humble bee|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/may/24/honey-i-love-you-our-40000-year-relationship-with-the-humble-bee|work=The Guardian|date=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mayan - Cylinder Vessel - Walters 482776 - Side B.jpg|thumb|Mok Chi', patron deity of beekeepers, on a codex-style [[Maya ceramics|Maya vessel]].]]
The [[Baganda people]] of [[Uganda]] hold the legend of [[Kintu]], the first man on earth. Save for his cow, Kintu lived alone. One day he asked permission from [[Ggulu]], who lived in heaven, to marry his daughter Nambi. Ggulu set Kintu on a trial of five tests to pass before he would agree. For his final test Kintu was told to pick Ggulu's own cow from a stretch of cattle. Nambi aided Kintu in the final test by transforming herself into a bee, whispering into his ear to choose the one whose horn she landed upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLeish|first=Kenneth |title=Bloomsbury Dictionary of Myth |date=1996 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-0-7475-2502-8 |url=https://corp.credoreference.com/component/booktracker/edition/294.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kintu the Person vs Kintu the Legend |url=http://www.buganda.com/kintu.htm |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kintu - The First Human in Buganda |url=http://bedsidereadings.com/folk-tales/kintu-the-first-human-in-buganda/ |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek Mythology]], [[Aristaeus]] was the god of [[bee-keeping]]. After inadvertently causing the death of [[Eurydice]], who stepped upon a snake while fleeing him, her [[nymph]] sisters punished him by killing every one of his bees. Witnessing the empty hives where his bees had dwelt, Aristaeus wept and consulted [[Proteus]] who advised him to give honor in memory of Eurydice by sacrificing four bulls and four cows. Upon doing so, he let them rot and from their corpses rose bees to fill his empty hives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McLeish |first=Kenneth|title=Bloomsbury Dictionary of Myth|date=1996 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-0-7475-2502-8 |url=https://corp.credoreference.com/component/booktracker/edition/294.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aristaeus |url=http://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/Aristaios.html |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Hittite mythology]], the god of [[agriculture]], [[Telipinu (god)|Telipinu]], went on a rampage and refused to allow anything to grow and animals would not produce offspring.  The gods went in search of Telipinu only to fail.  Then the goddess [[Hannahannah]] sent forth a bee to bring him back.  The bee finds Telipinu, stings him and smears wax upon him.  The god grew even angrier and it wasn't until the goddess [[Kamrusepa]] (or a mortal priest according to some references) uses a ritual to send his anger to the [[Underworld]].

In [[Hindu mythology]], [[Parvati]] was summoned by the Gods to kill the demon [[Arunasura]], who took over the heavens and the three worlds, in the form of [[Bhramari]] Devi. To kill Arunasura, she stings him numerous times with the help of innumerable black bees emerging from her body. The Gods were finally able to take control of the heavens and the celestial worlds again.&lt;ref name=DeviBhagavatam&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sacred-texts.com/hin/db/bk10ch13.htm#page_1046 |title=The Devi Bhagavatam: The Tenth Book: Chapter 13| website=sacred-texts.com |accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the bowstring on Hindu love god [[Kamadeva]]'s bow is made of sugarcane, covered in bees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beer, Robert |title=The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-3804Ud9-4IC&amp;pg=PA122 |year=2003 |publisher=Serindia Publications |isbn=978-1-932476-03-3 |page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale of '''Beren and Lúthien''', told in several works by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], is the story of the love and adventures of the mortal [[Man (Middle-earth)|Man]] [[Beren]] and the immortal [[Elf]]-maiden [[Lúthien]].  (Early versions of the story, published in the standalone book in 2017, described Beren as a Noldorin elf.) Tolkien wrote several versions of their story, the latest in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', and the tale is also mentioned in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The story takes place during the [[First Age]] of [[Middle-earth]], about 6,500 years&lt;ref name=Arda&gt;[http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/chronicle.html?startyear=505&amp;startage=1 The Encyclopedia of Arda]&lt;/ref&gt; before the events of ''The Lord of the Rings''.

Beren, son of [[Barahir]], cut a [[Silmaril]] from [[Morgoth|Morgoth's]] crown as the [[bride price]] for Lúthien, daughter of the elf-king [[Thingol]] and [[Melian|Melian the Maia]]. He was slain by [[Carcharoth]], the wolf of Angband, but alone of mortal Men returned from the dead.  He lived then with Lúthien on Tol Galen in Ossiriand, and fought the Dwarves at Sarn Athard. He was the great-grandfather of [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]], and thus the ancestor of the Númenórean kings. After the fulfilment of the quest of the Silmaril and Beren's death, Lúthien chose to become mortal and to share Beren's fate.&lt;ref name="Silmarilion"&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien (Christopher Tolkien, ed.), ''The Silmarillion'', Harper Collins, London, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and versions==
The first version of the story is ''the Tale of Tinúviel'', which was written in 1917 and published in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. During the 1920s Tolkien started to reshape the tale and to transform it into an [[epic poetry|epic poem]] which he called ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]''. He never finished it, leaving three of seventeen planned cantos unwritten. After his death ''The Lay of Leithian'' was published in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'', together with ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'' and several other unfinished poems. The latest version of the tale is told in prose form in one chapter of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and is recounted by [[Aragorn]] in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]'', which is told in the appendices of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', served as a sequel to this story.  Indeed, both Aragorn and Arwen were descendants of Beren and Lúthien.

==Synopsis==
As told in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the later version of the tale:

[[Beren]] was the last survivor of a group of Men in [[Dorthonion]] led by his father [[Barahir]] that had still resisted [[Melkor|Morgoth]], the Dark Enemy, after the [[Dagor Bragollach|Battle of Sudden Flame]], in which Morgoth had conquered much of northern [[Middle-earth]]. After the defeat of his companions he fled from peril into the elvish realm [[Doriath]]. There he met [[Lúthien]], the only daughter of King [[Thingol]] and [[Melian]] the [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]], as she was dancing and singing in a glade. Upon seeing her Beren fell in love, for she was the fairest of all elves. She later fell in love with him as well, when he, moved by her beauty and enchanting voice, gave her the nickname "Tinúviel" (which means nightingale.) As Thingol disliked Beren and regarded him as being unworthy of his daughter, he set a seemingly impossible task on Beren that he had to achieve before he could marry Lúthien. Thingol asked Beren to bring him one of the [[Silmaril]]s, the three hallowed jewels made by [[Fëanor]], which Morgoth had stolen from the elves. (This was a fateful act, which involved Thingol's people in the curse of the Noldor and eventually caused the destruction of Doriath.)

Beren left Doriath and set out on his quest to [[Angband]], the enemy's fortress. Although Thingol tried to prevent it, Lúthien later followed him. On his journey to the enemy's land Beren reached [[Nargothrond]], an Elvish stronghold, and was joined by ten warriors under the lead of King [[Finrod]], who had sworn an oath of friendship to Beren's father. Although [[Sons of Fëanor|Fëanor's sons]], [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], warned them not to take the Silmaril that they considered their own, the company was determined to accompany Beren. On their way to Angband they were seized by the servants of [[Sauron]], despite the best efforts of Finrod to maintain their guise as [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], and imprisoned in [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]]. One by one they were killed by a [[werewolf]] until only Beren and Finrod remained. When the wolf went for Beren, Finrod broke his chains and wrestled it with such fierceness that they both died.

When she was following Beren, Lúthien was captured and brought to Nargothrond by Celegorm and Curufin. Aided by [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]], Celegorm's [[hound]] (which according to prophecy could only be defeated by the greatest werewolf ever), she was able to flee. With his aid she came to Sauron's fortress where Huan defeated the [[Werewolf (Middle-earth)|werewolves]] of the Enemy, Draugluin the sire of werewolves, and Sauron himself in wolf-form. Then Lúthien forced Sauron to give ownership of the tower to her. She freed the prisoners, among them Beren. Meanwhile, Sauron took the form of a vampire and fled to [[Taur-nu-Fuin]] (the former Dorthonion).

Beren wanted to try his task once more alone, but Lúthien insisted on coming with him. However they were attacked by Celegorm and Curufin, who had been exiled from Nargothrond. Beren was wounded by Curufin, but Lúthien healed him. Through magic they took the shapes of the bat [[Thuringwethil]] and the wolf [[Draugluin]] that Huan had killed. Thereby they were able to enter the enemy's land and at last came to Angband and before Morgoth's throne. There Lúthien sang a magical song which made the Dark Lord and his court fall asleep; then Beren cut a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown. As he tried to cut out the others, his knife broke and a shard glanced off Morgoth's face, awakening him. As they attempted to leave, the gate was barred by [[Carcharoth]], a giant werewolf, who was bred as an opponent to Huan. He bit off and swallowed Beren's hand, in which Beren was holding the Silmaril.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;At this point ''The Lay of Leithian'' ends&lt;/ref&gt; Carcharoth was burned by the pure light of the Silmaril and ran off madly. Eagles then helped Beren and Lúthien escape.

Beren and Lúthien returned to Doriath, where they told of their deeds and thereby softened Thingol's heart. He accepted the marriage of his daughter and the mortal Man, although Beren's task had not been fulfilled. Beren and Huan participated in the hunt for Carcharoth, who in his madness had come into Doriath and caused much destruction there. Both of them were killed by the wolf, but Carcharoth was also slain. Before he died, Beren handed the Silmaril, which was recovered from Carcharoth's belly, to Thingol.

Grieving for Beren, Lúthien also died, and came to the halls of [[Mandos]]. There she sang of her ill fate, that she would never again see Beren, who as a mortal Man had passed out of the world. Thereby Mandos was moved to pity. He restored Beren and Lúthien to life and granted mortality to the Elf. Lúthien left her home and her parents and went to [[Ossiriand]] with Beren. There they dwelt for the rest of their lives, and both eventually died the death of mortal Men.

==Significance in the legendarium==

After the recovery of the Silmaril by Beren and Lúthien, many people of Middle-earth sought to possess it, and there were wars between the [[Sindar]], the [[Noldor]] and the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], in which the Sindar were defeated. The Silmaril was taken by [[Eärendil]], who sailed to [[Valinor]] with it and persuaded the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] to make war on Morgoth, which led to the latter's defeat in the [[War of Wrath]].

The marriage of Beren and Lúthien was the first of the three unions of a mortal Man and an Elf, of which came the [[Half-elven]], those who had both elven and human ancestry. Like Lúthien, they were given the choice of being counted among either Elves or Men. The extended edition of the live-action film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' would make this connection through a song Aragorn sings at night in Elvish. When questioned by Frodo, he simply explains that it relates to an Elven woman who gave up her immortality for the love of a Man.

==Inspiration==

The tale of Beren and Lúthien was regarded as the central part of his [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]] by Tolkien. The story and the characters reflect the love of Tolkien and his wife [[Edith Tolkien|Edith]]. Particularly, the event when Edith danced for him in a glade with flowering [[Conium|hemlocks]] seems to have inspired his vision of the meeting of Beren and Lúthien. Also some sources indicate that Edith's family disapproved of Tolkien originally, because he was a [[Catholicism|Catholic]].&lt;ref name = "bio"&gt;{{ME-ref|biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Tolkien's grave, J. R. R. Tolkien is referred to as Beren and Edith is referred to as Lúthien.&lt;ref name = "bio" /&gt;

The tale of Beren and Lúthien also shares an element with folktales such as the Welsh ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.comcast.net/~mithrandircq/Silmarillion_sources.htm Silmarillion sources, by "mithrandircq"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Shippey]], ''The Road to Middle-earth'', pp. 193–194: "The hunting of the great wolf recalls the chase of the boar [[Twrch Trwyth]] in the Welsh ''Mabinogion'', while the motif of 'the hand in the wolf's mouth' is one of the most famous parts of the ''Prose Edda'', told of Fenris Wolf and the god Tyr; Huan recalls several faithful hounds of legend, Garm, Gelert, Cafall."&lt;/ref&gt; maybe its main literary inspiration, and the German [[The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From Homer to Harry Potter |first=Matthew |last=Dickerson |first2=David |last2=O'Hara |year=2006 |publisher=[[Brazos Press]] |pages=141–2 |isbn=978-1-44120-214-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Griffin (fairy tale)|The Griffin]]—namely, the disapproving parent who sets a seemingly impossible task (or tasks) for the suitor, which is then fulfilled. The hunting of [[Carcharoth]] the Wolf may be inspired by the hunting of the giant boar [[Twrch Trwyth]] in Culhwch and Olwen  or other hunting legends. The quest for one of the three Silmarils from the Iron Crown of Morgoth has a close parallel in the search for the three golden hairs in the head of the Devil.  The sequence in which Beren loses his hand to the Wolf may be inspired by the god [[Tyr]] and the wolf [[Fenrir]], characters in [[Norse mythology]]. Tolkien also got inspiration from the great love story of Romeo and Juliet.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The book is illustrated by [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]] and edited by Christopher Tolkien, and it features different versions of the story, showing the development of the tale over time.

It is painstakingly restored from Tolkien's manuscripts and presented for the first time as a continuous and standalone story. The intent of the book is to extract a single narrative out of the ever-evolving materials that make up "The Tale of Beren and Lúthien". It does not contain every version or edit to the story, but those Christopher Tolkien believed would offer the most clarity and minimal explanation.

:...I have tried to separate the story of Beren and Tinúviel (Lúthien) so that it stands alone, so far as that can be done (in my opinion) without distortion. On the other hand, I have wished to show how this fundamental story evolved over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J.R.R.. Beren and Lúthien (Kindle Locations 86-88). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;
:The purpose of this book, then, is altogether different from that of the volumes of The History of Middle-earth from which it is derived. It is emphatically not intended as an adjunct to those books. It is an attempt to extract one narrative element from a vast work of extraordinary richness and complexity; but that narrative, the story of Beren and Lúthien, was itself continually evolving, and developing new associations as it became more embedded in the wider history. The decision of what to include and what to exclude of that ancient world 'at large' could only be a matter of personal and often questionable judgement: in such an attempt there can be no attainable 'correct way'. In general, however, I have erred on the side of clarity, and resisted the urge to explain, for fear of undermining the primary purpose and method of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J.R.R.. Beren and Lúthien (Kindle Locations 129-135). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book starts with the most complete version of the beginning of the tale, as told in ''The Book of Lost Tales'' (with only slight editing of character and place names to avoid confusion with later versions). The general aspect of the story has not been modified; Beren, for example, is a Gnome (Noldo), the son of Egnor bo-Rimion, rather than the human son of [[Barahir]]. (Beren's heritage switches between elf and man throughout the book, depending on which portion of the story is being told.)

As Christopher explains:

:A further problem which I should mention arose from the very frequent changes of names. To follow with exactness and consistency the succession of names in texts of different dates would not serve the purpose of this book. I have therefore observed no rule in this respect, but distinguished old and new in some cases but not in others, for various reasons. In a great many cases my father would alter a name in a manuscript at some later, or even much later, time, but not consistently: for example, Elfin to Elven. In such cases I have made Elven the sole form, or Beleriand for earlier Broseliand; but in others I have retained both, as in Tinwelint/ Thingol, Artanor/ Doriath.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J.R.R.. Beren and Lúthien (Kindle Locations 124-129). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further chapters continue the story in through later poems, summaries, and prose, showing how the story evolved over time, in order of the chronology of the story itself (not necessarily the order in which the texts were written or published). These include portions of various versions of "The Lay of Lethian", ''The Silmarillion'', and later chapters of ''Lost Tales''.

Since  J. R. R Tolkien made many changes in this story, affecting both narrative and style, the presentation in the book is not entirely consistent.  There is some overlap of details (and discrepancy in continuity), but the sections attempt a complete and continuous story. Christopher Tolkien included further editorial explanations and historical details to bridge between sections. Details lost in later accounts were reintroduced: such as [[Tevildo]] (who due to the nature of his introduction is treated as a separate character, rather than an early conception of [[Sauron]]), Thû the Necromancer (treated as the first appearance of Sauron), the Wicked (or "treacherous") Dwarves (one of ''[[The Hobbit]]'''s references to ''Lost Tales''), and other terminology such as Gnome, [[Fay]], [[Fairy]], leprechaun, and pixie. Some of these terms appear in early editions of ''The Hobbit'', but were dropped in later writing.

The book offers an "in-universe" perspective for the inconsistencies, as owing to the evolution of the stories told by different perspectives and voices over time, rather than simply reflecting Tolkien's changing ideas over time.

:the First Age in The History of Middle-earth was in those books conceived as a history in two senses. It was indeed a history— a chronicle of lives and events in Middle-earth; but it was also a history of the changing literary conceptions in the passing years; and therefore the story of Beren and Lúthien is spread over many years and several books. Moreover, since that story became entangled with the slowly evolving ''Silmarillion'', and ultimately an essential part of it, its developments are recorded in successive manuscripts primarily concerned with the whole history of the Elder Days.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J.R.R.. Beren and Lúthien (Kindle Locations 74-79). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

This book reintroduces details that were omitted in the highly edited version of ''The Silmarillion's'' "Of the Ruin of Doriath"; it includes the cursed treasure of Mîm, and the fact that Doriath was betrayed from the inside, and that Thingol was able to push the dwarves out of the city, and that he was later killed by an ambush of dwarves. It roughly reconciles the elements of early ''Lost Tales'' with details constructed by [[Guy Gavriel Kay|Guy Kay]] for the chapter in the ''Silmarillion'', to bring it closer to J.R.R. Tolkien's intention (see [[The War of the Jewels]]).

:...there are brought to light passages of close description or dramatic immediacy that are lost in the summary, condensed manner characteristic of so much Silmarillion narrative writing; there are even to be discovered elements in the story that were later altogether lost. Thus, for example, the cross-examination of Beren and Felagund and their companions, disguised as Orcs, by Thû the Necromancer (the first appearance of Sauron), or the entry into the story of the appalling Tevildo, Prince of Cats, who clearly deserves to be remembered, short as was his literary life.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J.R.R.. Beren and Lúthien (Kindle Locations 95-99). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Blood'''" is the third episode of the [[The X-Files (season 2)|second season]] of the [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on September 30, 1994. The teleplay was written by [[Glen Morgan]] and [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] from a story by [[Darin Morgan]] and was directed by [[David Nutter]]. The episode is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, unconnected to the series' wider [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. "Blood" earned a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen household rating]] of 9.8, being watched by 8.7 million households in its initial broadcast. The episode received mostly positive reviews.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. In the episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a series of killings in Franklin, Pennsylvania.  All the suspects appear compelled to murder after seeing violent messages on electronic devices.

"Blood" was inspired by writer Glen Morgan's own [[hematophobia]] as well as controversy over [[malathion]] spraying in [[Southern California]]. The episode marked the second appearance of [[the Lone Gunmen]] in the series, as well as a guest appearance by pornographic actress [[Ashlyn Gere]].

== Plot ==
In [[Franklin, Pennsylvania]], postal worker Edward Funsch ([[William Sanderson]]) is informed that he will be fired at the end of the week due to budget cuts. Afterwards, Funsch sees the words "Kill 'Em All" on his machine's digital display. At Franklin's [[civic center]], a middle-aged man in a crowded elevator sees "No Air" displayed on the elevator's [[LED display]], and is the only one who can see the message. Sweating and obviously [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]], he again glances at the LED display. This time it flashes the words "Can't Breathe" and then "Kill 'Em All."

Agent [[Fox Mulder]] arrives at the civic center after what looks like a [[massacre]]; bodies lie on the sidewalk and in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer ([[John Cygan]]) explains that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator with his bare hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips.

At the [[FBI Academy]], [[Dana Scully]] reads Mulder's initial report. The only connection between the murders that he can see is that the suspects all destroyed an electronic device during the killings. Meanwhile, Bonnie McRoberts, another Franklin resident, drops by a repair shop to pick up her car, where a message on an engine diagnostic display warns her that the mechanic is going to rape her. She impulsively kills him with an oil can spout. When Mulder and Spencer question her the next morning, her kitchen microwave instructs her to kill them. When she grabs a knife and attacks Mulder, she is shot and killed by Spencer.

Scully performs an autopsy on McRoberts' body and discovers signs of phobia including high levels of adrenaline and the same substance found on the elevator killer. She hypothesizes that the substance, when combined with other neurochemicals, produces an [[LSD]]-like reaction. While Mulder and Scully build a case, Funsch becomes more psychotic, continuing to see violent messages on electronic gadgets. Blood is associated in some way with each incident; a volunteer asks Ed to donate blood at a department store and seconds later he sees violent images, including a video of the 1993 [[Waco siege]] burning, flash across a sales display of TV sets, followed by a message to get a gun from the sporting goods department.

Late at night, while investigating an orchard, Mulder is sprayed by a crop-dusting helicopter and ends up in the hospital. There, Mulder sees the message "Do It Now" on a TV and realizes that when people are exposed to the pesticide, which contains a chemical called LSDM designed to provoke fear in insects, they see these [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] messages, and their phobias are exacerbated enough to cause them to kill. Eventually, after being confronted, the city councilman agrees to stop the spraying and blood test the community under the guise of a cholesterol study. Mulder and Scully, reading that Funsch has not been tested yet, arrive at his house to find it strewn with smashed electronic devices. Mulder deduces that blood is Ed's phobia and that he has seen the subliminal messages, and an empty rifle case signals that Funsch is going to act on his paranoia. Funsch positions himself at the top of a clock tower overlooking a blood drive and begins shooting randomly. Mulder climbs up to Funsch and overpowers him; Funsch is taken away on a stretcher. Mulder makes a call to Scully and sees the message "All done. Bye Bye" on his cell phone display. Scully calls out to Mulder but he is speechless.&lt;ref name="plot"&gt;Lowry, pp. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

[[File:Ashlyn gere adjusted.jpg|"Blood" contained a cameo appearance from porn actress [[Ashlyn Gere]].|150px|thumb|right]]

The basic premise for "Blood" evolved from three topics: co-writer Glen Morgan's own [[hematophobia]],&lt;ref name="plot1"&gt;Hurwitz, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; the controversy over [[malathion]] spraying in [[Southern California]], and an embryonic idea that Morgan and his writing partner [[James Wong (filmmaker)|James Wong]] had about focusing on [[postal workers]].&lt;ref name="plot2"&gt;Delasara, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; After series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] expressed his desire to feature a story revolving around digital readouts,&lt;ref name="lowry168"&gt;Lowry, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan and Wong decided to combine their disparate influences with the digital readout idea. They ended up crafting a script that turned "new technolog[ies]" (e.g. fax machines and cellular phones") into something "scary."&lt;ref name="lowry168"/&gt; Morgan and Wong also based the episode's climax around the 1966 [[Charles Whitman|massacre at the University of Texas]].&lt;ref name="plot1"/&gt; Of note, this scene was only partially filmed at the [[University of British Columbia]]&lt;ref name="lowry168"/&gt; because firearms were not allowed on location at the actual university.&lt;ref&gt;Gradnitzer pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; This necessitated that a replica of its clock tower's interior be constructed for use in several key scenes. This episode marks the first time that [[Darin Morgan]], Glen's brother, helped with an ''X-Files'' script. Darin had been asked to help flesh out the episode's story, and he would later write the second season episode "[[Humbug (The X-Files)|Humbug]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirby|first=Jonathan|title=Not Just a Fluke: How Darin Morgan Saved The X-Files|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/not-just-a-fluke-how-darin-morgan-saved-the-x-files/|work=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=January 2, 2013|date=October 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode features the second appearance of [[The Lone Gunmen]], a trio of conspiracy theorists consisting of [[John Fitzgerald Byers]] ([[Bruce Harwood]]), [[Richard Langly]] ([[Dean Haglund]]) and [[Melvin Frohike]] ([[Tom Braidwood]]). The characters first appeared in the [[The X-Files (season 1)|first season]] episode "[[E.B.E. (The X-Files)|E.B.E.]]" to make Mulder appear more credible.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitz p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The three were initially slated to appear in only one episode, but they were brought back as recurring characters starting with "Blood" due to their popularity with fans of the show online.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry, pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt; The episode also guest stars [[pornographic actress]] [[Ashlyn Gere]], who plays Bonnie McRoberts, the woman driven to attack Mulder after seeing a subliminal message on her microwave.&lt;ref name="plot1"/&gt; Glen Morgan joked that ''The X-Files'' was so cutting edge that they used an adult film star who was still working in the industry—an allusion to and jab at the ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' episode "Tempest in a C-Cup", which guest starred retired adult film actress [[Ginger Lynn]].&lt;ref name="plot1"/&gt;

==Reception==
"Blood" premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on September&amp;nbsp;30,&amp;nbsp;1994, and was first broadcast in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[BBC Two]] on September&amp;nbsp;11,&amp;nbsp;1995.&lt;ref name="BBCdate"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=[[The X-Files (season 2)|The X-Files: The Complete Second Season]] |year=1994–1995 |others=[[David Nutter]], [[Daniel Sackheim]], et al |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Corporation|Fox]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 9.1, with a 16 share, meaning that roughly 9.1 percent of all television-equipped households, and 16 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode.&lt;ref name="rating"/&gt; It was viewed by 8.7 million households.&lt;ref name="rating"&gt;Lowry, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode received positive reviews from critics. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the episode a B+, considering that despite the "convoluted plot" the episode "pays off in white-knuckle tension."&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,295179,00.html |title=X Cyclopedia: The Ultimate Episode Guide, Season 2 {{!}} EW.com |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' |date=November 29, 1996 |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer Zack Handlen of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' labeled the episode as a "good" stand-alone story. He described it as "a memorable episode, due in no small part to its humor", praising the "simultaneously absurd and frightening" story with scenes that make the viewer "snicker even as you shudder".&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; In addition, Handlen praised William Sanderson's performance, as well as the ending, calling it "the punchline [...] of Mulder's deepest fears, a group [The Syndicate] so secret that you never be sure they exist at all".&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/little-green-menthe-hostblood,13130/|first=Zack|last=Handlen|publisher=''[[The A.V. Club]]''|title=Little Green Men/The Host/Blood|date=August 15, 2008|accessdate=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starpulse named the episode the tenth best of the series, defining it as "very creepy" and what turned ''The X-Files'' "from a mere creepfest to a show that offered real psychological thrills".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrew|last=Payne|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/Andrew_Payne/2008/07/25/x_files_10_best_episodes|title='X-Files' 10 Best Episodes|publisher=Starpulse|date=July 25, 2008|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Shearman]] and [[Lars Pearson]], in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen'', rated the episode three stars out of five.  The two wrote positively of the episode's flourishes, noting "minute by minute, there is tons to enjoy."&lt;ref name="shearman"&gt;Shearman and Pearson, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shearman and Pearson argue that the premise is "disjointed and not a little frustrating" due to the lack of overall coherence and narrative.&lt;ref name="shearman"/&gt; The plot for "Blood" was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by [[Les Martin]], under the title ''Fear''.&lt;ref name="Martin1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fear|first=Les |last=Martin |authorlink=Les Martin |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |year=1996|isbn=0-06-440642-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/fear/oclc/877252720&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Fear (Book, 1997)|publisher=[[WorldCat]] |accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34639">[[File:CamelCase.svg|thumb|camelCase is named after the "humps" of its capital letters, similar to the humps of a [[Bactrian camel]]]]
[[File:1859 Kierch Elveng.jpg|thumb|From the early 17th century, inscriptions on various monuments incorporated [[chronogram]]s, where roman numerals adding up in sum to the date to be memorialised were shown taller than the surrounding letters, which might be regarded as a form of camel case.

'''Camel case''' (stylized as '''camelCase'''; also known as '''camel caps''' or more formally as '''medial capitals''') is the practice of writing compound words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation in the middle of the phrase begins with a [[capitalization|capital letter]], with no intervening spaces or punctuation. Common examples include "[[iPhone]]" and "[[eBay]]". It is also sometimes used in online usernames such as "johnSmith", and to make multi-word [[domain names]] more legible, for example in advertisements.

Camel case is often used for variable names in computer programming. Some programming styles prefer camel case with the first letter capitalised, others not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Naming Conventions |url=http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/naming-conventions.html |publisher=Scala |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nfrmwk&gt;{{cite web |title=Capitalization Styles - .NET Framework 1.1|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x2dbyw72(v=vs.71).aspx |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Camel Case |url=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CamelCase |accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For clarity, this article calls the two alternatives '''upper camel case''' (initial uppercase letter, also known as '''Pascal case''') and '''lower camel case''' (initial lowercase letter). Some people and organizations, notably [[Microsoft]],&lt;ref name=nfrmwk/&gt; use the term ''camel case'' only for lower camel case.  ''Pascal case'' means only upper camel case.

Camel case is distinct from [[Title Case]], which capitalises all words but retains the spaces between them, and from [[Tall Man lettering]], which uses capitals to emphasize the differences between similar-looking words such as "predniSONE" and "predniSOLONE". Camel case is also distinct from [[snake case]], which uses [[underscores]] interspersed with lowercase letters (sometimes with the first letter capitalized). The combination of "upper camel case" and "snake case" is known as "Darwin case". Darwin case uses [[underscores]] between words with initial uppercase letters, as in "Sample_Type". It has no known conventional use in computer programming but is named after [[Charles Darwin]] because of the way it has "evolved" from more traditional conventions.{{citation needed|reason=invented by whom, named by whom, where and when is it used?|date=October 2018}}

The earliest known occurrence of the term "InterCaps" on Usenet is in an April 1990 post to the group &lt;span style="font-family: monospace, monospace;"&gt;alt.folklore.computers&lt;/span&gt; by Avi Rappoport.&lt;ref name="compoundNames" /&gt; The earliest use of the name "CamelCase" occurs in 1995, in a post by Newton Love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Newton Love |url=//groups.google.com/group/comp.os.os2.advocacy/msg/ab3c8107c6e150fa |title=I'm happy again! – comp.os.os2.advocacy &amp;#124; Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |date=12 September 1995 |accessdate=23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love has since said, "With the advent of programming languages having these sorts of constructs, the humpiness of the style made me call it HumpyCase at first, before I settled on CamelCase. I had been calling it CamelCase for years. ... The citation above was just the first time I had used the name on USENET."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sluug.org/~newt/ Newton Love]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional use in natural language ==

===In word combinations===
The use of medial capitals as a convention in the regular spelling of everyday texts is rare, but is used in some languages as a solution to particular problems which arise when two words or segments are combined.

In Italian, pronouns can be suffixed to verbs, and because the honorific form of second-person pronouns is capitalized, this can produce a sentence like ''non ho trovato il tempo di risponderLe'' ("I have not found time to answer you" - where ''Le'' means "to you").

In [[German language|German]], the medial capital letter [[I]], called ''[[Binnen-I]]'', is sometimes used in a word like ''StudentInnen'' ("students") to indicate that both ''Studenten'' ("male students") and ''Studentinnen'' ("female students") are intended simultaneously. However, mid-word capitalisation does not conform to [[German orthography]]; the previous example could be correctly written using [[parentheses]] as ''Student(inn)en'', analogous to "congress(wo)man" in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= ''Richtiges und gutes Deutsch: Das Wörterbuch der sprachlichen Zweifelsfälle'' |series=Duden |volume=9 |location=Mannheim |publisher=Bibliographisches Institut |page=418 |date=2011 |edition=7th |isbn=978-3411040971 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Irish orthography|Irish]], camelcase is used when an inflectional prefix is attached to a proper noun, for example {{lang|ga|i nGaillimh}} ("in [[Galway]]"), from {{lang|ga|Gaillimh}} ("Galway");  {{lang|ga|an tAlbanach}} ("the Scottish person"), from {{lang|ga|Albanach}} ("Scottish person"); and {{lang|ga|go hÉirinn}} ("to [[Ireland]]"), from {{lang|ga|Éire}} ("Ireland"). In recent [[Scottish Gaelic alphabet|Scots Gaelic orthography]], a hyphen has been inserted: {{lang|ga|an t-Albannach}}.

This convention is also used by several written [[Bantu languages]] (e.g., ''kiSwahili'', "[[Swahili language]]"; ''isiZulu'', "[[Zulu language]]") and several indigenous [[languages of Mexico]] (e.g. [[Nahuatl languages|Nahuatl]], [[Totonacan languages|Totonacan]], [[Mixe–Zoque languages|Mixe–Zoque]], and some [[Oto-Manguean languages]]).

In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], when capitalizing the digraph ''[[IJ (digraph)|ij]]'', both the letter ''I'' and the letter ''J'' are capitalized, for example in the countryname ''[[Iceland|IJsland]]''.

In English, medial capitals are usually only found in Scottish or Irish "Mac-" or "Mc-" names, where for example ''MacDonald, McDonald,'' and ''Macdonald'' are common spelling variants of the same name, and in Anglo-Norman "Fitz-" names, where for example both ''FitzGerald'' and ''Fitzgerald'' are found.

In their English style guide ''[[The King's English]]'', first published in 1906, [[Henry Watson Fowler|H. W.]] and [[Francis George Fowler|F. G. Fowler]] suggested that medial capitals could be used in triple [[compound word]]s where [[hyphen]]s would cause ambiguity—the examples they give are ''KingMark-like'' (as against ''King Mark-like'') and ''Anglo-SouthAmerican'' (as against ''Anglo-South American''). However, they described the system as "too hopelessly contrary to use at present."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===In transliterations===

In the scholarly transliteration of languages written in other scripts, medial capitals are used in similar situations. For example, in transliterated [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], ''ha'&lt;span style="font-family:Times New Roman"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;vri'' means "the Hebrew person" or "the Jew" and ''b'Yerushalayim'' means "in Jerusalem".  In [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] proper names like ''rLobsang'', the "r" stands for a prefix glyph in the original script that functions as [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] marker rather than a normal letter. Another example is ''ts&lt;span style="font-family:Times New Roman"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;urku'', a Latin transcription of the [[Chechen language|Chechen]] term for the capping stone of the characteristic [[Vainakh medieval towers|Medieval defensive towers]] of [[Chechenia]] and [[Ingushetia]]; the capital letter "&lt;span style="font-family:Times New Roman"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;" here denoting a [[phoneme]] distinct from the one transcribed as "i".

=== In abbreviations ===
Medial capitals are traditionally used in abbreviations to reflect the capitalization that the words would have when written out in full, for example in the academic titles [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] or [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]]. In German, the names of statutes are abbreviated using embedded capitals, e.g. StGB (Strafgesetzbuch) for Criminal Code, PatG (Patentgesetz) for Patent Act, BVerfG (Bundesverfassungsgericht) for [[Federal Constitutional Court]], or the very common GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) for [[Private limited company|Company with Limited Liability]]. In this context, there can even be three or more "CamelCase" capitals, e.g. in TzBfG for Teilzeit- und Befristungsgesetz (Act on Part-Time and Limited Term Occupations). In French, camel case acronyms such as [[Oulipo|OuLiPo]] (1960) were favored for a time as alternatives to initialisms.

Camel case is often used to transliterate initialisms into alphabets where two letters may be required to represent a single character of the original alphabet, e.g., [[DShK]] from [[Cyrillic]] ДШК. &lt;!-- Need a real example for the following: In [[Japan]], Camel case is sometimes used when transliterating [[Hiragana]] or [[Katakana]] product names or initialisms into Roman alphabet. --&gt;

== History of modern technical use ==

=== Chemical formulae ===
The first systematic and widespread use of medial capitals for technical purposes was the notation for chemical formulae invented by the Swedish chemist [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius|Jacob Berzelius]] in 1813. To replace the multitude of naming and symbol conventions used by chemists until that time, he proposed to indicate each chemical element by a symbol of one or two letters, the first one being capitalized. The capitalization allowed formulae like "NaCl" to be written without spaces and still be parsed without ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] (1813). ''Essay on the Cause of Chemical Proportions and on Some Circumstances Relating to Them: Together with a Short and Easy Method of Expressing Them''. ''[[Annals of Philosophy]]'' 2, 443-454, 3, 51-52; (1814) 93-106, 244-255, 353-364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry M. Leicester &amp; Herbert S. Klickstein, eds. 1952, ''A Source Book in Chemistry, 1400-1900'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard)&lt;/ref&gt;

Berzelius' system continues to be used, augmented with three-letter symbols such as "[[ununennium|Uue]]" for unconfirmed or unknown elements and abbreviations for some common substituents (especially in the field of organic chemistry, for instance "[[Ethyl group|Et]]" for "ethyl-"). This has been further extended to describe the [[amino acid]] sequences of [[protein]]s and other similar domains.

=== Early use in trademarks ===
Since the early 20th century, medial capitals have occasionally been used for [[corporation|corporate]] names and product [[trademark]]s, such as
* ''DryIce Corporation'' (1925) marketed the solid form of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO₂) as "Dry Ice", thus leading to its common name.&lt;ref name="About Dry ice"&gt;{{Cite book| title=The Trade-mark Reporter| publisher=[[International Trademark Association|United States Trademark Association]]| year=1930| issue=v. 20| isbn=1-59888-091-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[CinemaScope]] and [[VistaVision]], rival [[widescreen]] [[film|movie]] formats (1953)
* [[ShopKo Stores Inc.|ShopKo]] (1962)
* ''MisteRogers'', the [[Canada|Canadian]] version of ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'' (1962)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0250165/ |title="MisteRogers" (1962) |publisher=Imdb.com |date= |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[AstroTurf]] (1967)&lt;!-- Trademark serial number 72286166 --&gt;
* [[ConAgra Foods Inc.|ConAgra]], formerly Consolidated Mills (1971).
* [[MasterCraft Boat Company|MasterCraft]] (1968)

=== Computer programming ===
{{Original research|section|reason=few citations and internet search shows no original sources, only sources that got it from Wikipedia|date=May 2011}}
In the 1970s and 1980s, medial capitals were adopted as a standard or alternative [[naming convention (programming)|naming convention]] for multi-word [[Identifier (computer programming)|identifier]]s in several [[programming language]]s. The precise origin of the convention in computer programming has not yet been settled. A 1954 conference proceedings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/mit/summer_session_1954/Digital_Computers_Advanced_Coding_Techniques_Summer_1954.pdf |title="Resume of Session 8". Digital Computers: Advanced Coding Techniques. Summer Session 1954, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|page=8-6 |format=PDF |date=1954 |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; occasionally informally referred to IBM's [[Speedcoding]] system as "SpeedCo". [[Christopher Strachey]]'s paper on [[General purpose macro processor#Examples of general purpose macro processors|GPM]] (1965),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Strachey |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Strachey |title=A General Purpose Macrogenerator |journal=Computer Journal |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=225–241 |date=October 1965 |doi=10.1093/comjnl/8.3.225}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a program that includes some medial capital identifiers, including "&lt;code&gt;NextCh&lt;/code&gt;" and "&lt;code&gt;WriteSymbol&lt;/code&gt;".

Multiple-word descriptive identifiers with embedded spaces such as &lt;code&gt;end of file&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;char table&lt;/code&gt; cannot be used in most programming languages because the spaces between the words would be [[Parser|parsed]] as [[delimiter]]s between [[Lexical analysis#Token|tokens]]. The alternative of running the words together as in &lt;code&gt;endoffile&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;chartable&lt;/code&gt; is difficult to understand and possibly misleading; for example, &lt;code&gt;chartable&lt;/code&gt; is an English word (able to be charted).

Some early programming languages, notably [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] (1958) and [[COBOL]] (1959), addressed this problem by allowing a [[hyphen]] ("-") to be used between words of compound identifiers, as in "END-OF-FILE": Lisp because it worked well with prefix notation (a Lisp parser would not treat a hyphen in the middle of a symbol as a subtraction operator) and COBOL because its operators were individual English words. This convention remains in use in these languages, and is also common in program names entered on a [[command line]], as in Unix.

However, this solution was not adequate for mathematically-oriented languages such as [[FORTRAN]] (1955) and [[ALGOL 58|ALGOL]] (1958), which used the hyphen as an infix subtraction operator. These early languages instead allowed identifiers to contain unrestricted embedded spaces, determining the end of the identifier by context. This approach was abandoned in later languages due to the complexity it adds to [[Lexical analysis#Tokenization|tokenization]]. (FORTRAN initially restricted identifiers to no more than six characters, effectively preventing multi-word identifiers except those made of very short words, such as "GO TO"="GOTO".)

Exacerbating the problem, common [[punched card]] character sets of the time were uppercase only and lacked other special characters. It was only in the late 1960s that the widespread adoption of the [[ASCII]] character set made both lowercase and the [[underscore]] character &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; universally available. Some languages, notably [[C (programming language)|C]], promptly adopted underscores as word separators, and identifiers such as &lt;code&gt;end_of_file&lt;/code&gt; are still prevalent in C programs and libraries (as well as in later languages influenced by C, such as [[Perl]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]). However, some languages and programmers chose to avoid underscores—among other reasons to prevent confusing them with [[Whitespace character|whitespace]]—and adopted camel case instead.

[[Charles Simonyi]], who worked at [[Xerox PARC]] in the 1970s and later oversaw the creation of Microsoft's Office suite of applications, invented and taught the use of [[Hungarian Notation]], one version of which uses the lowercase letter(s) at the start of a (capitalized) variable name to denote its type. One account{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} claims that the camel case style first became popular at Xerox PARC around 1978, with the [[Mesa (programming language)|Mesa programming language]] developed for the [[Xerox Alto]] computer. This machine lacked an underscore key, and the hyphen and space characters were not permitted in identifiers, leaving camel case as the only viable scheme for readable multiword names. The PARC Mesa Language Manual (1979) included a coding standard with specific rules for upper and lower camel case that was strictly followed by the Mesa libraries and the Alto operating system.

The [[Smalltalk]] language, which was developed originally on the Alto and became quite popular in the early 1980s, may{{according to whom|date=January 2017}} have been instrumental in spreading the style outside PARC. Camel case was also used by convention for many names in the [[PostScript]] page description language (invented by [[Adobe Systems]] founder and ex-PARC scientist [[John Warnock]]), as well as for the language itself. In addition, [[Niklaus Wirth]], the inventor of [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], came to appreciate camel case during a sabbatical at PARC and used it in [[Modula]], his next programming language.

=== Spread to mainstream usage ===
Whatever its origins within the computing world, the practice spread in the 1980s and 1990s, when the advent of the [[personal computer]] exposed hacker culture to the world. Camel case then became fashionable for corporate [[trade name]]s, initially in technical fields; mainstream usage was well established by 1990:

During the [[dot-com bubble]] of the late 1990s, the lowercase prefixes "e" (for "[[electronics|electronic]]") and "i" (for "[[Internet]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Farhad Manjoo |url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2002/04/52181 |title=Grads Want to Study on EMacs, Too |publisher=Wired.com |date=30 April 2002|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[information]]", "[[intelligent]]", etc.) became quite common, giving rise to names like [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iMac]] and the [[Zentyal|eBox]] software platform.

In 1998, Dave Yost suggested that chemists use medial capitals to aid readability of long chemical names, e.g. write AmidoPhosphoRibosylTransferase instead of [[amidophosphoribosyltransferase]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15821399.900-feedback.html ''Feedback, 20 June 1998''] Vol 158 No 2139 [[New Scientist]] 20 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt; This usage was not widely adopted.

Camelcase is sometimes used for abbreviated names of certain neighborhoods, e.g. New York City neighborhoods ''SoHo'' (''So''uth of ''Ho''uston Street) and ''TriBeCa'' (''Tri''angle ''Be''low ''Ca''nal Street) and San Francisco's ''SoMa'' (''So''uth of ''Ma''rket). Such usages erode quickly, so the neighborhoods are now typically rendered as ''Soho'', ''Tribeca'', and ''Soma''.

Internal capitalization has also been used for other technical codes like [[HeLa]] (1983).

== Current usage in computing ==

=== Programming and coding ===
{{main article|Naming convention (programming)}}
The use of medial caps for compound identifiers is recommended by the [[coding style]] guidelines of many organizations or software projects. For some languages (such as [[Mesa (programming language)|Mesa]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Modula]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]]) this practice is recommended by the language developers or by authoritative manuals and has therefore become part of the language's "culture".

Style guidelines often distinguish between upper and lower camel case, typically specifying which variety should be used for specific kinds of entities: [[variable (computer science)|variable]]s, [[field (computer science)|record fields]], [[method (computer science)|method]]s, [[procedure (computer science)|procedures]], [[type (computer science)|types]], etc. These rules are sometimes supported by [[static code analysis|static analysis]] tools that check source code for adherence.

The original [[Hungarian notation]] for programming, for example, specifies that a lowercase abbreviation for the "usage type" (not data type) should prefix all variable names, with the remainder of the name in upper camel case; as such it is a form of lower camel case.

Programming identifiers often need to contain [[acronyms and initialisms]] that are already in uppercase, such as "old HTML file". By analogy with the title case rules, the natural camel case rendering would have the abbreviation all in uppercase, namely "oldHTMLFile". However, this approach is problematic when two acronyms occur together (e.g., "parse DBM XML" would become "parseDBMXML") or when the standard mandates lower camel case but the name begins with an abbreviation (e.g. "SQL server" would become "sQLServer"). For this reason, some programmers prefer to treat abbreviations as if they were lowercase words and write "oldHtmlFile", "parseDbmXml" or "sqlServer". However, this can make it harder to recognise that a given word is intended as an acronym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=To CamelCase or Under_score|author1=Dave Binkley|author2=Marcia Davis|author3=Dawn Lawrie|author4=Christopher Morrell|citeseerx=10.1.1.158.9499|publisher=IEEE|pages=158–167|journal=IEEE 17th International Conference on Program Comprehension, 2009. ICPC '09.|year=2009|quote=In terms of camel-cased identifiers, this has a greater impact on identifiers that include short words and especially acronyms. For example, consider the acronym ID found in the identifier kIOuterIIDPath. Because of the run of uppercase letters, the task of reading kIOuterIIDPath, in particular the identification of the word ID, is more difficult.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wiki link markup ===
Camel case is used in some [[wikitext|wiki markup languages]] for terms that should be automatically linked to other [[wiki]] pages. This convention was originally used in [[Ward Cunningham]]'s original [[wiki software]], [[WikiWikiWeb]], and can be activated in most other wikis. Some wiki engines such as [[TiddlyWiki]], [[Trac]] and [[PmWiki]] make use of it in the default settings, but usually also provide a configuration mechanism or [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] to disable it. [[Wikipedia]] formerly used camel case linking as well, but switched to explicit link markup using [[square brackets]] and many other wiki sites have done the same. Some wikis that do not use camel case linking may still use the camel case as a naming convention, such as [[AboutUs]].

=== Other uses ===
The [[National Information Exchange Model|NIEM]] registry requires that [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] data elements use upper camel case and XML attributes use lower camel case.

Most popular [[command-line interface]]s and [[shell script|scripting]] languages cannot easily handle file names that contain embedded spaces (usually requiring the name to be put in quotes). Therefore, users of those systems often resort to camel case (or underscores, hyphens and other "safe" characters) for compound file names like &lt;span style="font-family: monospace, monospace;"&gt;MyJobResume.pdf&lt;/span&gt;.

[[Microblogging]] and [[social networking]] sites that limit the number of characters in a message are potential outlets for medial capitals. Using camel case between words reduces the number of spaces, and thus the number of characters, in a given message, allowing more content to fit into the limited space. [[Hashtag]]s, especially long ones, often use camel case to maintain readability (e.g. #CollegeStudentProblems is easier to read than #collegestudentproblems).

In website URLs, spaces are [[Percent-encoding|percent-encoded]] as "%20", making the address longer and less [[human readable]]. By omitting spaces, camel case does not have this problem.

== Readability studies ==
Camel case has been criticised as negatively impacting readability due to the removal of spaces and uppercasing of every word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/magazine/29FOB-onlanguage-t.html?_r=2&amp;ref=magazine&amp;|publisher=New York Times|title=Against Camel Case|author=Caleb Crain|date=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study comparing [[snake case]] to camel case found that camel case identifiers could be recognised with higher accuracy among both programmers and non-programmers, and that programmers already trained in camel case were able to recognise those identifiers faster than underscored snake-case identifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=To CamelCase or Under_score|author1=Dave Binkley|author2=Marcia Davis|author3=Dawn Lawrie|author4=Christopher Morrell|citeseerx=10.1.1.158.9499|publisher=IEEE|pages=158–167|journal=IEEE 17th International Conference on Program Comprehension, 2009. ICPC '09.|year=2009|quote=The experiment builds on past work of others who study how readers of natural language perform such tasks. Results indicate that camel casing leads to higher accuracy among all subjects regardless of training, and those trained in camel casing are able to recognize identifiers in the camel case style faster than identifiers in the underscore style.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 follow-up study, under the same conditions but using an improved measurement method with use of eye-tracking equipment, indicates: "While results indicate no difference in accuracy between the two styles, subjects recognize identifiers in the underscore style more quickly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5521745&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5521745 |id=([http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/ICPC2010-CamelCaseUnderScoreClouds.pdf download PDF]) |title=An Eye Tracking Study on camelCase and under_score Identifier Styles |author1=Bonita Sharif|author2=Jonathan I.

ICPC '10. |year=2010 |quote=An empirical study to determine if identifier-naming conventions (i.e., camelCase and under_score) affect code comprehension is presented. An eye tracker is used to capture quantitative data from human subjects during an experiment. The intent of this study is to replicate a previous study published at ICPC 2009 (Binkley et al.) that used a timed response test method to acquire data. The use of eye-tracking equipment gives additional insight and overcomes some limitations of traditional data gathering techniques. Similarities and differences between the two studies are discussed. One main difference is that subjects were trained mainly in the underscore style and were all programmers. While results indicate no difference in accuracy between the two styles, subjects recognize identifiers in the underscore style more quickly.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Co-Dependents' Day'''" is the fifteenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 15)|fifteenth season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on March 21, 2004.

==Plot==
[[Homer Simpson|Homer]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] see the newest ''Cosmic Wars'' film, ''The Gathering Shadow'', and the movie turns out to be less than what they expected. At home, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] suggests that Bart and Lisa write a letter to ''Cosmic Wars'' creator Randall Curtis. Two weeks later, they get a reply from Curtis, which completely ignores their criticism, having sent them Jim-Jam merchandise. This forces the Simpsons to go on a trip to [[California]], where Homer and Marge go to wineries, and Bart and Lisa go to the Cosmic Wars Ranch. The kids visit Curtis, and tell him that his ''Cosmic Wars'' movies have lost their way. Curtis dismisses their criticisms, until Lisa explains that improved technology does not count for story and characterization. Curtis agrees, and decides to go back to his storytelling roots by watching more [[Chanbara|samurai films]] and [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] for inspiration. 

Bart and Lisa rejoin Homer and Marge, who are both drunk from free samples of the wine. Back in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], Homer and Marge go to Moe's Tavern and drink more wine. Moe opens a bottle of [[Chateau Latour]] 1886 vintage wine, clearly unaware of its value. 
Homer and Marge then continue to drink heavily for several days, until Marge suffers a particularly painful hangover. She tells Homer that they should not be drinking, and he agrees. Unfortunately, when they go to an [[Oktoberfest]] featuring Grammy-winning nuclear polka band [[Brave Combo]], Marge, who tries to go through the night without drinking, gives in and ends up drunk along with Homer. He tries to drive them home, but in a drunken stupor overturns the car.

In order to avoid an arrest, Homer makes things look like Marge (who is drunker than he is) was the driver. She is arrested, but he bails her out. Later, [[Barney Gumble|Barney]] suggests that Marge go to a rehab clinic for a month, and when Marge is gone, Homer lets [[Ned Flanders|Flanders]] take care of the kids. When he sees her at the clinic, he confesses, but Marge is angry and drinks again. Later on, the other rehab patients help her discover that she likes being with Homer more than she likes drinking, and forgives him and returns home.

==Production notes==
* The scene where Homer sings at Moe's Tavern while Marge plays the piano was cut from this episode, but later used in "[[Mommie Beerest]]" as a postscript scene during the end credits.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}
* Homer references a prior DUI when explaining why he cannot be caught in the drivers seat. This could possibly be referring to the episode, "[[Duffless]]," where he fails a [[breathalyzer]] test, and is arrested for a DWI.
* Series creator [[Matt Groening]] learned of Dallas-area band [[Brave Combo]] as a college-radio DJ in the 1980s, and had commissioned the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning band, (Best Polka Album 1999, 2004&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=Brave+Combo&amp;title=&amp;year=All&amp;genre=All "Brave Combo Awards"]. Grammy.com search. Retrieved 2012-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;) to perform at "his best friend's wedding party", where Groening invited them to appear on the show. According to Carl Finch, founding member of the band, within two weeks, the network contacted them for video reference material for the animators for their "Springfield-yellow likenesses." The band recorded a [[polka]] arrangement of ''The Simpsons'' theme song, and made available two other songs for use in the Oktoberfest scene on the show.&lt;ref name="DO"&gt;Hepola, Sarah (March 11, 2004).

==Reception==
James Greene of [[Nerve.com]] put the episode sixth on his list ''Ten Times The Simpsons [[Jumping the shark|Jumped the Shark]]'', singling out the storyline of Homer deliberately framing Marge for a crime he committed just to save his own skin. Greene remarked "This Homer wasn't a sometimes-insensitive-but-largely-sympathetic lug. He was just a douche." He did however like the "excellent" B-story, but found that it was "completely overshadowed by a very uncomfortable moment in the Simpson-Bouvier union"

[[image:sch_ewf_6.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Example of a color wash in multiple hues]]
A '''color wash''' is a popular technique in [[faux painting]] using [[paint]] thinned out with [[glaze (painting technique)|glaze]] to create a subtle wash of color over walls or other surfaces.  

Color washing is an easy and forgiving form of faux finishing often used by beginners, but perfected by professional finishers.  It was historically created with oil-based products because of the long drying time, but today's environmental and health conscious companies are producing user-friendly water based glazes.  Color washing can be done in any color of paint and is generally applied with brushes over a solid paint color, using long sweeping strokes to meld the glaze colors together.

'''Compensatory lengthening''' in [[phonology]] and [[historical linguistics]] is the lengthening of a [[vowel]] sound that happens upon the loss of a following [[consonant]], usually in the [[syllable coda]], or of a vowel in an adjacent [[syllable]]. Lengthening triggered by consonant loss may be considered an extreme form of [[Fusion (phonetics)|fusion]] (Crowley 1997:46). Both types may arise from speakers' attempts to preserve a word's [[Mora (linguistics)|moraic]] count.&lt;ref name=Hayes1989&gt;

==Examples==

===English===
An example from the [[history of the English language|history of English]] is the lengthening of vowels that happened when the [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|/x/}} and its [[voiceless palatal fricative|palatal]] [[allophone]] {{IPA|[ç]}}&lt;ref name=Millward1996&gt;

For example, in the [[Middle English]] of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s time the word ''night'' was phonemically {{IPA|/nixt/}}; later the {{IPA|/x/}} was lost, but the {{IPA|/i/}} was lengthened to {{IPA|/iː/}} to compensate, causing the word to be pronounced {{IPA|/niːt/}} ("neet"). (Later the {{IPA|/iː/}} became {{IPA|/aɪ/}} by the [[Great Vowel Shift]].)

Both the [[Germanic spirant law]] and the [[Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law]] show vowel lengthening compensating for the loss of a nasal.

Non-rhotic forms of English have a lengthened vowel before a historical post-vocalic {{IPA|*/r/}}: in Scottish English, ''girl'' has a short {{IPA|/ɪ/}} followed by a light alveolar {{IPA|/r/}}, as presumably it did in Middle English; in Southern British English, the {{IPA|*/r/}} has dropped out of the spoken form and the vowel has become a "long schwa" {{IPA|[əː]}}.

===Classical Hebrew and Aramaic===
Compensatory lengthening in Classical Hebrew and Aramaic is dependent on the class of consonant which follows the prefix (definite article in Hebrew and prefix waw-hahipukh in both languages).

E.g. (using the Hebrew definite article [hey with pataḥ plus dagesh in following consonant]):&lt;ref&gt;Hoffer, Victoria.  ''Biblical Hebrew: Supplement for Enhanced Comprehension''.  New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 2005.  Pg. 58.  See also Garrett, Duane A., and Jason S. DeRouchie, ''A Modern Grammar for Biblical Hebrew''.  Nashville: Broadman &amp; Holman Academic, 2009.  Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Before ע and א it is usually [hey with qametz].
* Before ח and ה  it is usually [hey with pataḥ].  If it is pretonic it may be [hey with qametz].
* But when it is propretonic, whatever the guttural, it will usually be [hey with segol].

===Ancient Greek===
Compensatory lengthening is very common in [[Ancient Greek]]. It is particularly notable in forms where ''n'' or ''nt'' comes together with ''s'', ''y'' (= ι̯), or ''i''. The development of ''nt'' + ''y'' was perhaps thus:

* *mont-yă → montsa ([[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] ''ty'' → ''ts'') → mõtsa ([[nasal vowel|nasalization]] and vowel lengthening) → mõssa → mõsa (shortening ''ss'' → ''s'') → mōsa (denasalization, retention of long vowel) = μοῦσα "[[muse]]"

Forms with this type of compensatory lengthening include the nominative singular and dative plural of many participles, adjectives, and nouns, the [[grammatical person|3rd person]] [[grammatical number#Singular versus plural|plural]] ending for [[present tense|present]] and [[future tense|future]] [[voice (grammar)|active]] of all [[verb]]s, and the 3rd person singular present of [[thematic vowel|athematic]] verbs:

* *πάντ-ς → πᾶς "every, whole" ([[grammatical gender|masculine]] [[nominative case|nominative]] singular)&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_2i_uni.htm#299 par. 299]: adjs. in ''nt''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* *πάντ-ι̯ᾰ → *πάντσα → πᾶσα (feminine)
* *πάντ-σι → πᾶσι (masculine/neuter dative plural)
*compare παντ-ός (m./n. genitive singular)
* *όντ-ι̯ᾰ → *όντσα → οὖσα participle "being" (feminine nominative singular)&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_2j_uni.htm par. 301 a and d]: participles in ''nt''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* *οντ-ίᾱ → *ονσία → οὐσία "property, essence"
*compare ὀντ-ός (m./n. genitive singular, from participle ὤν "being",)
*[[Doric Greek|Doric]] ἄγ-[[thematic vowel|ο]]-ντι → ἄγοντσι → [[Attic Greek|Attic]]/[[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] ἄγουσι "they drive"
*Doric φα-ντί → *φαντσί → Attic/Ionic φᾱσί "they say"&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, [http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/smyth_2Vq_notes.htm#462D par. 462 note]: Doric athematic verb endings.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18007">'''Concrete art''' was an art movement with a strong emphasis on geometrical abstraction. The term was first formulated by [[Theo van Doesburg]] and was then used by him in 1930 to define the difference between his vision of art and that of other abstract artists of the time. After his death in 1931, the term was further defined and popularized by [[Max Bill]], who organized the first international exhibition in 1944 and went on to help promote the style in [[Latin America]]. The term was taken up widely after World War 2 and promoted through a number of international exhibitions and art movements.

==Origination==
[[File:Art Concret vol 01 no 01 front cover 01.jpg|thumb|''Revue Art Concret'', May 1930.]]
After the formal break up of [[De stijl]], following the last issue of its magazine in 1928, van Doesburg began considering the creation of a new collective centered on a similar approach to abstraction. In 1929 he discussed his plans with Uruguayan painter [[Joaquín Torres-García]], with candidates for membership of this group including [[Georges Vantongerloo]], [[Constantin Brancusi]], [[František Kupka]], [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Friedrich Vordemberge-Gildewart]] and [[Antoine Pevsner]], among others. However, van Doesburg divided the candidates between artists whose work was still not completely abstract and those free of referentiality. As this classification entailed the possibility of a disqualification of the first group, the discussions between the two soon broke down, prompting Torres-García to team up instead with Belgian critic [[Michel Seuphor]] and form the group [[Cercle et Carré]].&lt;ref&gt;Wintgens Hötte, Doris (2009) "Van Doesburg tackles the continent: passion, drive &amp; calculation", in: Gladys Fabre &amp; Doris Wintgens Hötte (red.): ''Van Doesburg &amp; the International Avant-Garde: Constructing a New World'', London, Tate Publishing, 2010, pp. 10-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, van Doesburg proceeded to propose a rival group, ''[[Art Concret]]'', championing a geometrical [[abstract art]] closely related to the aesthetics of [[Neo-plasticism]]. In his opinion, the term ‘abstract’ as applied to art had negative connotations; in its place he preferred the more positive term ‘concrete’.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Luc Daval, "Avant Garde Art 1914-1939", Skira, Geneva 1980, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Doesburg was eventually joined by [[Otto Gustaf Carlsund|Otto G. Carlsund]], [[Léon Arthur Tutundjian]], [[Jean Hélion]] and his fellow lodger, the typographer [[Marcel Wantz]] (1911-79), who soon left to take up a political career.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Hélion, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ROXpBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT202&amp;dq=Marcel%20Wantz&amp;pg=PT202#v=onepage&amp;q=Marcel%20Wantz&amp;f=false "Art Concret 1930: Four Painters and a Magazine”], in ''Double Rhythm: Writings About Painting'', Skyhorse Publishing 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1930 they published a single issue of their own French-language magazine, ''Revue Art Concret'', which featured a joint [[manifesto]], positioning them as the more radical group of abstractionists.

"'''BASIS OF CONCRETE PAINTING'''&lt;br&gt;
We say:
# Art is universal.
# A work of art must be entirely conceived and shaped by the mind before its execution. It shall not receive anything of nature’s or sensuality’s or sentimentality’s formal data. We want to exclude lyricism, drama, symbolism, and so on.
# The painting must be entirely built up with purely plastic elements, namely surfaces and colors. A pictorial element does not have any meaning beyond “itself”; as a consequence, a painting does not have any meaning other than “itself”.
# The construction of a painting, as well as that of its elements, must be simple and visually controllable.
# The painting technique must be mechanic, i.e., exact, anti-impressionistic.
# An effort toward absolute clarity is mandatory."&lt;ref&gt; [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-1-4614-7052-6%2F1.pdf Springer p.413-4]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group was short lived and only exhibited together on three occasions in 1930 as part of larger group exhibitions, the first being at the ''Salon des Surindépendents'' in June, followed by ''Production Paris 1930'' in [[Zürich]], and in August the exhibition ''AC: Internationell utställning av postkubistisk konst'' (International exhibition of post-cubist art) in [[Stockholm]], curated by Carlsund. In the catalog to the latter, Carlsund states that the group's "programme is clear: absolute Purism. [[Neo-Plasticism]], [[Purism (arts)|Purism]] and [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] combined".&lt;ref&gt;''AC: Internationell utställning av postkubistisk konst'', Stockholm, 1930, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before van Doesburg's death in 1931, the members of the Art Concret group still active in Paris united with the larger association [[Abstraction-Création]].

==Theoretical background==
{{further|Mathematics and art }}
In 1930, [[Michel Seuphor]] had defined the role of the abstract artist in the first issue of ''Cercle et Carré''. It was “to establish, on the foundations of a structure that is simple, severe and unadorned in every part, and within a basis of unconcealed narrow unity with this structure, an architecture which, using the technical means available to its period, expresses in a clear language that which is truly immanent and immutable.”&lt;ref&gt;Jean Luc Daval, "Avant Garde Art 1914-1939, Skira, Geneva 1980", p.171&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian Werner Haftmann traces the development of the pure abstraction proposed by Seuphor to the synthesis of Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and Dutch [[Neo-Plasticism]] in the [[Bauhaus]], where painting abandoned the artificiality of representation for technological authenticity.  “In close connection with architecture and engineering, art should endeavour to give form to life itself … [The former] provided new sources of inspiration as well as new materials – steel, aluminium, glass, synthetic materials.”&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann p.285&lt;/ref&gt; 

As van Doesburg had pointed out in his manifesto, in order to be universal, art must abandon subjectivity and find impersonal inspiration purely in the elements of which it is constructed: line, plane and color. Some later artists associated with this tendency, such as [[Victor Vasarély]], [[Jean Dewasne]], [[Mario Negro]] and [[Richard Mortensen]], only came to painting after first studying science.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann p.340&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, all theoretical advances seek justification in past practice, and in this case the mathematical proportions expressed in abstract form are to be identified in various art forms over millennia. Thus, argued Hartmann, “the elimination of representational images and the overt use of pure geometry do not imply a radical and definitive rejection of the great art of the past, but rather a reassertion of its eternal values stripped of their historical and social disguises.”&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann p.341&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:FFM Sculpture Kontinuitaet 2012 Max Bill 1986 6.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Max Bill]], ''Continuity (Colossus of Frankfurt),'' 1986, collection: [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Frankfurt am Main]]. Max Bill "was keen on creating works based on mathematical and geometric foundations—material manifestations of intellectual processes that resisted symbolism." &lt;ref&gt;[http://db-artmag.de/en/66/news/max-bills-continuity-in-a-new-location/  Monolith on the Water—Max Bill’s "Continuity" in a New Location; Deutsche Bank Art works]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While Abstraction-Création was a grouping of all modernistic tendencies, there were those within it who carried the idea of mathematically inspired art and the term ‘concrete art’ to other countries when they moved elsewhere. A key figure among them was Joaquin Torres García, who returned to South America in 1934 and mentored artists there. Some of those went on to found the group [[Madí|''Arte Concreto Invención'']] in Buenos Aires in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Stiles&lt;/ref&gt; Another was the designer [[Max Bill]], who had studied at the [[Bauhaus]] in 1927-9. After returning to Switzerland, he helped organize the [[Allianz (arts)|Allianz]] group to champion the ideals of Concrete Art. In 1944 he organized the first international exhibition in Basle and at the same time founded ''abstract-konkret'', the monthly bulletin of the Gallerie des Eaux Vives in Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;Stiles&lt;/ref&gt; By 1960 Bill was organizing a large retrospective exhibition of Concrete Art in Zürich illustrating 50 years of its development.

Abstraction, which had been quietly gathering momentum in Italy between the world wars, emerged officially in the [http://www.kettererkunst.com/dict/movimento-arte-concreta.shtml ''Movimento d'arte concreta''] (MAC) in 1948, whose foremost exponent, [[Alberto Magnelli]], was another past member of Abstraction-Création and had been living in France for many years. However, some seventy native painters were represented in the ''Arte astratta e concreta in Italia'' exhibition held three years later at the National Gallery in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, p.340&lt;/ref&gt; In Paris recognition of this approach resulted in several exhibitions of which the first was titled ''Art Concret'' and held at the Gallerie René Drouin during the summer of 1945. Described as "the first major post-World War 2 exhibition of abstract art”,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Lee Morgan, ''Historical Dictionary of Contemporary Art'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2016&lt;/ref&gt; the artists exhibited there included the older generation of abstractionists: [[Jean Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[César Domela]], [[Otto Freundlich]], [[Jean Gorin]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Alberto Magnelli, Piet Mondrian, Antoine Pevsner and van Doesburg. In the following year a series of annual exhibitions began in the [[Salon des Réalités Nouvelles]], which included some of these artists and were devoted, according to its articles of association, to “works of art commonly called: concrete art, non-figurative or abstract art".&lt;ref&gt;Georges Folmer, "Le Salon des Réalités Nouvelles : pour et contre l’art concret", [http://www.folmer.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/salondesrealitesnouvelles.pdf p.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 [http://www.kunstzolder.be/en/movement/groupe-espace Groupe Espace] was founded in France to harmonize painting, sculpture and architecture as a single discipline. This grouped sculptors and architects with old established artists such as Sonia Delaunay and Jean Gorin and the newly emergent Jean Dewasne and Victor Vasarély. Its manifesto was published in ''L’Architecture d’Aujourd’hui'' that year and placarded on the streets of Paris, championing its aim of the harmonious development of all human activities. It extended beside into practical politics, having elected as its honorary president the Minister for Reconstruction and Urban Development, [[Eugène Claudius-Petit]].&lt;ref&gt;Eve Roy, [http://musees-nationaux-alpesmaritimes.fr/fleger/sites/musees-nationaux-alpesmaritimes.fr/files/eve_roy_la_pre_sence_fondamentale_de_la_plastique_19_avril_2013.pdf  “La présence fondamentale de la plastique, L’exposition du Groupe Espace à Biot en 1954: un essai de synthèse des arts”], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

As time progressed, a distinction began to be made between ‘cold abstraction’, which was identified with geometric Concrete Art, and ‘warm abstraction’, which, as it moved towards the various kinds of [[Lyrical abstraction]], reintroduced personality into art.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Moszynska, Abstract Art, Thames &amp; Hudson, London 1990, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; The former eventually fed into international movements building on technological aspects championed by the pioneers of Concrete Art, emerging as [[optical art]], [[kinetic art]] and programmatic art.&lt;ref name=DelPuppo2013&gt;Alessandro Del Puppo, ''L'arte contemporanea: Il secondo novecento'', Einaudi, 2013, table 3 page 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The term Concrete also began to be extended to other disciplines than painting, including sculpture, photography and poetry. Justification for this was theorized in South America in the 1959 [[Neo-Concrete Movement|Neo-Concrete Manifesto]], written by a group of artists in Rio de Janeiro who included [[Lygia Clark]], [[Hélio Oiticica]] and [[Lygia Pape]].&lt;ref&gt;Stiles&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eastern roll eggs in the White House in 1929.jpg|thumb|250px|Egg roll on the White House lawn, 1929]]
'''Egg rolling''', or an '''Easter egg roll''' is a traditional game played with [[Egg (food)|eggs]] at [[Easter]]. Different nations have different versions of the game, usually played with [[Hard-boiled egg|hard-boiled]], [[decorated egg]]s.

==History==
Starting in 1835, Jacob Grimm and other writers proposed that the pre-Christian [[Saxons]] had a spring goddess, [[Eostre]], whose [[festival|feast]] was held on the [[Vernal Equinox]], around 21 March. Grimm also suggested that her symbolic animal was "probably" the spring [[hare]], and that the egg symbolized the rebirth of the land in spring. 

Some claim that [[Pope Gregory the Great]] had ordered his missionaries to use old religious sites and [[festival]]s in order to absorb them into Christian rituals wherever possible. According to Grimm and his followers, the [[Christian]] celebration of the [[Resurrection of Christ]] was ideally suited to be merged with the [[Pagan]] feast of [[Ēostre]] and many of those pagan traditions were adopted into the Christian festivities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.england-in-particular.info/calendar/c-easter.html england-in-particular: Easter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324205036/http://www.england-in-particular.info/calendar/c-easter.html |date=2008-03-24 }} Retrieved on 2008-03-14&lt;/ref&gt; In England, Germany, and other countries, children traditionally rolled eggs down hillsides at Ēostre festivities.

The event was featured in the 2007 film ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]''.

==Other countries==
In Germany, a prize is awarded to the contestant whose egg rolls fastest down a track made of sticks. In [[Denmark]], decorated eggs are rolled down slopes in grassland or forest - the contestant whose egg rolls farthest is the winner - and the eggs are eaten after the game (if not broken). The tradition is particularly common around the town of [[Køge]]. In [[Lithuania]] one collects those eggs that are touched by the one rolled. 

In [[Egypt]], children bowl red and yellow eggs toward another row of eggs and whoever's egg cracks one egg, may claim them all. 

In eastern Europe, there are other traditions such as [[egg tapping]] and [[Decorated egg|egg decorating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{quote|The Florisbad fossil site consists of a sequence of Quaternary deposits associated with a thermal spring, situated 45 km NNW of Bloemfontein in central South Africa (28°46’S, 26°04’E). There are two kinds of fossil context at Florisbad: naturally accumulated vertebrate fossil material from spring sedimentary contexts, which includes the human skull fragment, and archaeological remains from old land surfaces. The material from spring contexts represents mainly the remains of ancient carnivore hunting and scavenging around palaeo-waterholes associated with the spring. Spring sediments intrude into the horizontal or sub-horizontal deposits, which, in some cases, represent stable land surfaces. These land surfaces are, to a greater or lesser degree, disturbed by post-depositional spring action and saturation during times of a higher water table...The Florisbad fossil locality is internationally known for producing a pre-modern human skull, Middle Pleistocene fossil vertebrates and Middle Stone Age artefacts...}}

[[Anthropology]] is the study of various aspects of&amp;nbsp;[[human]]s&amp;nbsp;within past and present&amp;nbsp;[[Society|societies]].&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anthropology?q=anthropology|title=anthropology|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27505/anthropology|title=anthropology|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm|title=What is Anthropology?|publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]]|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study is practiced in multiple countries, each of whom has their own history of how anthropology has developed in their respective countries.

== Latin America ==
Anthropology in Latin America is a well established discipline that has existed for over 100 years. The countries that are summarized in this section include Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, the Andean region, Costa Rica, and Colombia. Latin America anthropologists established their discipline in conjunction with American and European anthropologists, and revised their disciplines to study cultural phenomena through their own perspectives, independent of American and European thought.   [[File:Map-Latin America and Caribbean.png|thumb|Latin America and the Caribbean]]

=== Andes ===

Andean anthropology’s roots began during the turn of the 20th century, containing social movements between two groups in Peru, and from academia within the United States. The mestizo (non-native) and indigenous intellectuals known as indigenistas competed for political and intellectual space and recognition in Peru. Indigenous intellectuals advocated for interculturalidad, where indigenous thought could occupy Peruvian society as its own entity and not become blended as a singular national identity that the mestizaje proposed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Anthropologies: Disciplinary Transformations within Systems of Power|last=Ribiero|first=Gustavo|last2=Escobar|first2=Arturo|publisher=Berg|others=Marisol de la Cadena|year=2006|isbn=9781845201913|location=New York, New York|pages=201–224|chapter=The Production of Other Knowledges and Its Tensions: From Andeanist Anthropology to Interculturalidad?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mestizaje perspective sought to modernize Peru and model their society similar to the United States. [[José María Arguedas]] was a writer and ethnographer in Peru, who classified himself as an indigenous intellectual that challenged Western thought and ideology. [[John Victor Murra]], an anthropologist teaching in the United States collaborated with Arguedas. Their collaboration stemmed from Murra’s travels in 1952 to the Latin American region when he was working under the anthropologist [[Sidney Mintz]] as a PhD student. Indigenistas were active in social and political movements in Latin America and collaborated with people inside of the United States, but still sought to be independent from Western thought.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Logo of the American Anthropological Association.png|thumb|AAA]]
In 1936, the [[American Anthropological Association]] initiated studies in Latin America on how to incorporate indigenous people in Latin American society, termed acculturation studies, and in 1935, the [[Social Science Research Council]], the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], and the Committee on Latin American studies worked to benefit the interests of the United States. The Peruvian government funded anthropological institutions beginning in the 1940s, and the establishment of the Instiuto de Etnologia y Arqueologia and a Peruvian sector in the Instituto Indigneista Interamericano followed. By the 1960s Peruvian governmental funding decreased, and became reliant upon the United States for funding. The indigenous incorporation into the goal of a singular society was termed cholification by the Peruvian sociologist [[Aníbal Quijano|Anibal Quijano]]. In the 1990s during the Neo-liberal era, indigenous thought became more recognized with political conflicts in the Andean region, and interculturalidad was pursued again for Andean states to recognize the diversity of the people that occupied them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Argentina ===
Social Anthropology was established in Argentina in 1957. It was first institutionalized at the University of [[Buenos Aires]]. Before the institutionalization of social anthropology, the discipline largely focused on historical studies. Rosana Guber attributes the introduction of social anthropology to [[Esther Hermitte]] who was a history professor at the Ethnographic Museum in Argentina. It was during her trips to the University of Chicago that she was introduced to social anthropology, and so it was the west who influenced the institutionalization of social anthropology in Argentina. In 1965, students began to ask for a discipline separate from sociology, and that was not focused primarily on indigenous people. There was a movement around this time that called for a greater understanding of the changes modern society was going through, especially during and after the 1966 [[Revolución Argentina]]. Later, in 1974, students and faculty within departments that were studying social movements and change suffered kidnappings and murders by the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance|Argentine AntiCommunist Alliance]]. The current status of Argentinian anthropology is still deeply rooted in western influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Committed or Scientific? The Southern Whereabouts of Social Anthropology and Antropologia Social in 1960-70 Argentina|last=Guber|first=Rosana|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Boscovik|editor-first=Alexander|location=|pages=110–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
[[File:Getulio Vargas (1930).jpg|thumb|Getúlio Vargas (1930)|234x234px]]
Anthropology in Brazil was institutionalized in 1930 at the beginning of the [[Vargas Era]]. Later during the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil was experiencing political authoritarianism. As a result, anthropology began to address inter-ethnic friction. In the 1970s anthropologists began to consider nearby urban studies as a topic of research. The 1980s kicked off a more modern type of anthropology where anthropologists began to look at themselves as “the other”. Brazil did not have an issue of [[alterity]] or exoticism, because it existed within its own borders. Brazil began to value exoticism and viewed it as the acknowledgement of cultural diversity according to [[:pt:Mariza Peirano|Mariza Peirano]]. In general, the overall current goal for Brazilian anthropology was to better the future for modernization by enlightening modern political elite and identifying relevant topics for investigation. Some of Brazil’s main anthropological institutions are the University of Brazil, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, and the Brazilian Association of Anthropology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Other People's Anthropologies: Ethnographic Practice on the Margins|last=Boskovic|first=Alexander|publisher=Berghahn Books|others=Mariza G.S. Peirano|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=186–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colombia ===
Anthropology in Colombia was institutionalized during the mid-1940s. Between the 1950s-70’s, Colombian anthropologists sought to integrate into national society and began to deal with terms like culture, integration, and assimilation. However, during the 1970s, this early understanding of anthropology was opposed and anthropologists began to confront terms such as national integration because they felt it was loaded with other issues like racial supremacy. Emerging social movements encouraged this new way of thinking because it recognized the rights of peasant and ethnic populations as well as the influence of Marxism. Anthropologists continued this way of thinking through the 1980s although a larger influence from militant anthropology became apparent. By militant anthropology, Myriam Jimeno refers to anthropologists who often debate and participate, but write very little. The goal of this type of anthropology was to alter the symbols of national identity and to accompany new ethnic movements in finding representation. Anthropologists and ethnic groups aimed to challenge the way indigenous groups were being ostracized by cultural hegemony. Later on in 1991, Colombia underwent a process of constitutional reform and development in attempt to recognize more cultural and ethnic rights. Some of its current most influential institutions are the [[Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History]], the Colombian National University, and the National Institute of Ethnology.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/165081955|title=A companion to Latin American anthropology|last=Poole|first=Deborah|date=2008|publisher=Blackwell Pub|others=Jimeno, Myriam|year=|isbn=0631234683|location=Malden, MA|pages=72–89|oclc=165081955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costa Rican anthropology was institutionalized in 1967 under political influence. According to Margarita Bolaños Arquín, increasing notions of nationalism and anti imperialism led to the institutionalization of social sciences in Costa Rica. During the 1960s, around the time of institutionalization, social scientists' primary focus was on the birth and implications of social movements, as well as the consequences of modernization in rural areas. Later, French [[Structural Marxism]] influenced the social sciences to take an interest in the study of class structures. Over time, anthropology in Costa Rica was highly criticized in its struggle to find its identity. Caught in a sort of balancing act between western and Latin American practice, anthropology in Costa Rica eventually learned to take the criticisms of other anthropologies and made a name for itself with a focus on gender studies, identity studies, and developmental problems. To legitimize their discipline, anthropology contributed to other sciences such as linguistics, agriculture, and psychology. However, during the 1980s Costa Rica endured a recession, and anthropological institutions were under threat. During this time, [[globalization]] was becoming increasingly popular and while during the recession of the 1980s Costa Rica was not seen as a power player, at the start of the 1990s, the country could now participate in ways that were productive. It was not until around the 1990s that anthropologists regained the opportunity to research and, after such political and economic turmoil, there was much to question. Throughout the 1990s the focus of anthropology and other disciplines such as sociology continued to research in rural areas but shifted their research to the survival of the poor during tough economic times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolanos|first=Margarita|date=Fall 2002|title=Costa Rican Social Anthropology in the Central American Context at the End of the Twentieth Century|url=|journal=Practicing Anthropology|volume=24|pages=17–21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
[[Manuel Gamio]], the first Mexican anthropologist, earned his PhD in 1921, having studied under [[Franz Boas]]. The first anthropology department was established in 1938. Indigenous population studies known as indigenism, are an integral part of Mexican anthropology, and became popular during the presidency of [[Lázaro Cárdenas|Lázaro Cardenas]], serving from 1934-1940. The [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|National Institute of Anthropology and History]] was established by President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] in 1939, and remains a prominent place of anthropological study in Latin America. The nation-building interests of incorporating the indigenous population into the Mexican state also led to the establishment of the Inter-American Indian Institute in 1942, in Mexico City, along with the establishment of the academic journal, America Indígena. Marxist theory was predominantly used to analyze social phenomena, and was combined with social evolution theory that viewed Mexico in three historical time phases: pre-Hispanic, Colonial, and Modern.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the 1970s, [[Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán]], an anthropologist who was formerly a medical doctor worked for the federal government and promoted critical anthropology in Mexico that used Marxist theory and rejected imperialistic practices from the United States. Mexico’s urban populations began to increase in the 1970s, which became another topic of study for anthropologists. In the 1980s, Gramscian Marxism became the theoretical center, and studies included rural and urban populations, and labor. Institutions of anthropology have continued to increase since the 1980s, offering undergraduate and graduate degrees. Neo-liberal market transformations in the 1990s have affected anthropological training presently, as students may find careers not only in the universities, but non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Anthropologies: Disciplinary Transformations within Systems of Power|last=Ribeiro|first=Gustavo|last2=Escobar|first2=Arturo|publisher=Berg|others=Esteban Krotz|year=2006|isbn=9781845201913|location=New York, New York|pages=87–109|chapter=Mexican Anthropology's Ongoing Search for Identity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Asia ==
Asia includes the countries China, Japan, Philippines, and Siberia. Anthropology in Asia has been influenced by Western anthropological ideologies through colonial contact, historically. While the discipline of anthropology is historically built from nation-building and colonization from core countries, language and publishing barriers, funding opportunities and political status all influence the structure of anthropological research in each Asian country. Anthropology in the social and cultural perspective have not always had a strong tradition in Asian anthropology, but ethnography, ethnology, and folklore often have dominant roots within the discipline.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== China ===
[[File:Cai_Yuanpei_1.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cai_Yuanpei_1.jpg|thumb|Cai Yuanpei, the father of anthropology in China]]
[[China|Chinese]] anthropology was founded by scholar [[Cai Yuanpei]]. Cai Yuanpei was a scholar educated at the [[University of Leipzig]], and he brought both Western influence and standardization into the discipline of anthropology in China. The first department of anthropology was founded in 1928 with Cai Yuanpei’s creation of [[Academia Sinica]] in [[Beijing]]. At Academia Sinica, physical anthropology and archaeology held focus.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62324831|title=World anthropologies : disciplinary transformations within systems of power|last=Smart|first=Josephine|publisher=|others=Ribeiro, Gustavo Lins., Escobar, Arturo, 1951-|year=|isbn=9781845201913|location=Oxford, UK|pages=69–85|oclc=62324831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz Boas also brought Western influence to China, and British functionalism would make a lasting impact on Chinese anthropology. In addition to Cai Yuanpei, [[Wu Wenzao]] was one of the most influential proponents of Western-influenced anthropology, and he took classes under [[Ruth Benedict]] (one of Boas’ students that would be influential in the field of anthropology on her own overall).&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55146652|title=The making of anthropology in East and Southeast Asia|last=Liu|first=Xin|date=2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|others=Yamashita, Shinji., Bosco, Joseph, 1957-, Eades, J.

World War II pushed back the institutional development of anthropology in China until the late 1940s. With this revitalization, Chinese anthropologists began to look inwards at themselves for subjects of study. This inward focus led anthropologists of the time to attempt to use anthropology to better Chinese society.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; 1940-late 1950s was a time of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence in China, followed by 1957-1977 and [[Mao Zedong]]’s era of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;  During this time, Maoist aims supplemented ethnology and Chinese national identity creation.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;
[[File:Chinese_Academy_of_Social_Sciences_building_photo_from_VOA.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chinese_Academy_of_Social_Sciences_building_photo_from_VOA.jpg|thumb|243x243px|Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) building]]
Post-1978 was a time of reform in China following the end of Mao Zedong's leadership. Academia was reconstructed, and anthropology subsequently saw a revival during this time. Exchanges between foreign faculty and students helped to globalize Chinese anthropology and bring in other perspectives.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Liang Zhaotong was an advocate for the revival of social and cultural anthropology, but for this to happen, anthropology had to be seen as a useful tool for improvements in the field of the social sciences and society.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Anthropology was held in lower regard than ethnology in China due to the ideology of Mao Zedong, and anthropologists left anthropology for other disciplines in social science, such as sociology, which subsequently saw a large period of development in the 1980s. This lower regard for anthropology also caused the field to receive less attention and less funding from the public and Chinese institutions.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

The [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] (CASS) and the [[State Education Committee]] founded the Chinese Anthropological Association in 1981 (now part of the East Asian Anthropological Association). Today, anthropology in China is still influenced by its history of being less practical and less important in the field of social sciences. This causes a lack of public interest and awareness in Chinese anthropology in favor of more “professional” disciplines, such as medicine, business, law, etc.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Japan ===
[[File:Ryuzo_Torii_01.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ryuzo_Torii_01.jpg|thumb|Torii Ryuzo 1952]]
The creation of anthropology in [[Japan]] was a response to the research of [[Edward S. Morse|Edward Morse]], the first professor of Zoology at [[Tokyo Imperial University]], where he discovered signs of cannibalism in Japan.  Japanese nationalism motivated Japanese peoples to study themselves rather than being subjects of study by outsiders.  This motivation led to the formation of Anthropological Society of [[Tokyo]] in 1886.  Tsuboi Shôgorô was a leading member of this group, and he is named one of the founding fathers of Japanese anthropology.  In 1892, he became the first professor of anthropology at [[Tokyo Imperial University]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Making of Anthropology in East and Southeast Asia|last=Bosco|first=Joseph|last2=Eades|first2=J.S.|last3=Yamashita|first3=Shinji|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2004|isbn=1-57181-259-8|location=United States|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, the Japanese colonial empire was marked by the annexation of [[Taiwan]] and led to an increase in domestic ethnographers in this region.  [[Torii Ryūzō]] was Tsuboi's successor and greatly attributed data and photographs of Taiwan during this time period.  His own research abroad redirected peoples' focus from themselves, Japanese folklore-studies, to the colonial Others.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The expansion [[List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|Japanese imperialism]] drove [[Torii Ryūzō|Ryūzō]]'s research of others.  This shift in research subjects created a separate discipline, ethnology or 'race studies.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania|last=Shimizu|first=Akitoshi|last2=van Breman|first2=Jan|publisher=Curzon Press|year=1999|isbn=0-7007-0604-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Japanese Society of Ethnology (''Nihon Minzokugakkai'') was formed, which separated Japanese folklore and ethnological studies from comparative ethnology.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In 1968, the Eighth Congress of the [[International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences]] (IUAES) was held in Japan.

In 2004, in response to the IUAES, the Japanese Society of Ethnology changed its name to the Japanese Society of Cultural Anthropology; this is one of the largest organizations at 2,000 members.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Considered to be a semi-peripheral country in comparison to the West, Japan is home to the largest number of anthropologists in Asia as well as the largest center for anthropological research in Asia.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Japan's history resembles a colonial power in East Asia.  Currently, language and audience discrepancies hinder open conversations between Japanese and American anthropologies.  Since Western academic anthropologists publish in English, their local and global audience is essentially one.  In Japan, writing for a global audience requires publishing in English.  While Japanese scholars are knowledgeable about Western anthropological theories and trends, institutional factors deter Japanese anthropologists to publish in English;  a more extensive peer review process can delay publication approval for years resulting in outdated empirical data.  Japanese academics prefer to publish in university in-house journals where there is a much shorter delay in publication approval.  A local audience means publishing in Japanese and increasing the gap between world anthropologies.

=== Philippines ===
The movement of [[indigenization]] of anthropology in the [[Philippines]] challenges foreign-adopted Western concepts, theories and methods.  To understand the viewpoints of this process, indigenization can be examined as a historical process, a perspective of native concepts, and as both a problem and solution created by colonial or neocolonial educational curriculum.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Yamashita, Shinji, et al. “Towards Indigenization: Responses, Challenges, and Experiences in the Philippines.” ''The Making of Anthropology in East and Southeast Asia'', Berghahn Books, 2004, pp. 335–353.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1560-1898, the Philippines was under Spanish colonial regime.  During this time, Spanish colonizers established society through theologoical orthodoxy.  They valued their own written history over the Philippines' native traditions, and oral tradition was undermined by colonization.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

From 1898-1941, the second period of colonization by the United States took place.  Ethnographic knowledge was established as the basis of integration of indigenous elements into mainstream Philippine society.  In 1914, anthropology curriculum was established at the [[University of the Philippines]], and three years later, an anthropology department was created.  In 1921, the anthropology department at the University of Philippines merged with the sociology department.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

During the post-war era (1946-1968), student activism, national pride and identity reinforced the process of decolonization; the University of the Philippines was at the forefront of this movement. Filipino scholars increasingly pursued graduate programs in the United States anthropology departments.  This created an issue that will be discussed further.

From 1970-1986, social and political consciousness in the Philippines marked a revolutionary period.  The country adopted conflict models; Marxist ideology was more suitable for the Philippines that was in a crisis state.  In the late 1970s, the Philippine Folklore Society was formed.  This growth of folklore studies was due to the further development of indigenization in the Philippines.  In 1977, The Philippine Anthropological Society (Ugnayan ng Agham Tao or UGAT) was founded.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

After 1986, this period was marked by a heightened cultural consciousness.  President Corazon Aquino promoted culture through creation of the National Commission for Culture and Arts (NCCA).

The distance between native and foreign anthropologists is a conflict in the Philippines.  While most scholars receive formal education in Western societies, they often return "home" and view their native society through a foreign, Westernized lens they were conditioned and educated by.  Native anthropologists are hindered by a perspective based on bias.  Interests, training, values, and field exposure can result in differences between foreign and native anthropologists.  It is important to recognize these different angles, politics of representation, and ethnographic authority in order to successful observe others as well as our own societies.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Another challenge in anthropology in the Philippines is discussed by Filipino anthropologist, Carlos Jr. P Tatel, about funding for research on governmental and regional levels.  He explains that anthropology proposals for funding often deviate from original plan in order to fit the agendas of agencies who grant travel and research funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=|last=Tatel|first=Carlos Jr. P.|date=2017|work=Video Interview|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Siberia ===
[[Siberia]] as a territory was important in the development of Russian anthropology due to its position of alterity within Russia. Siberia and the people of [[Northern Russia]] were points of great interest throughout various periods in Russian history as it tried to better understand its own people.
[[File:Vladimir_Bogoraz.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vladimir_Bogoraz.jpg|thumb|Vladimir Bogoraz, one of the founding fathers of Siberian studies in Russia]]
The beginnings of ethnographic research in Siberia were heavily influenced by anthropology in Germany and ideas of Russian nationalism in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62324831|title=World anthropologies : disciplinary transformations within systems of power|last=Vakhtin|first=Nikolai|publisher=|others=Ribeiro, Gustavo Lins., Escobar, Arturo, 1951-|year=|isbn=9781845201913|location=Oxford, UK|pages=49–65|oclc=62324831}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition led by Franz Boas, the [[Jesup North Pacific Expedition]] from 1897-1902, helped to bring international attention to the concept of doing anthropology in Siberia in relation to Russian anthropology in addition to bringing Boas’ anthropological perspective into Russia.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Also on this expedition were [[Vladimir Bogoraz]], [[Vladimir Jochelson]], and Leo Sternberg, who would be known as the founding fathers of Siberian studies, and influential ethnographers in Russia.

The nationalistic undercurrent in Russia at the time of the beginnings of researching Siberia as a place of intrigue was reflected in the Russians' attitude towards the people in Siberia. The impetus to study Siberians was rooted in the idea that one day the people in the area would all assimilate to Russian culture, and due to this, the current culture of the people should be documented and recorded.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Russian ideologies heavily influenced the research field in Siberia, and studying Russian and Siberian history was an easier route for research due to the uncertainty of what would be acceptable to study under the Russian government in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Under Soviet Russia in the early 20th century, ethnology moved toward a more l[[Structuralist anthropology|structural]] and [[Functionalism (anthropology)|functionalist]] view, with the goal of generally understanding human culture.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; When [[Joseph Stalin]] came into power, this view shifted as Stalin aimed to homogenize Russian culture and identity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Ethnologists were employed by the state with a focus on understanding, regulating, and standardizing the different ethnic groups of Russia.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Central and Eastern Europe ==
[[File:Central_and_Eastern_Europe_Map.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Central_and_Eastern_Europe_Map.png|left|thumb|468x468px|Map of Central and Eastern Europe]]
Central and Eastern Europe includes the countries of Austria, Croatia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, and Hungary among many others. Anthropological study is active in many places Europe through research centers, academic societies, and universities on a range of topics. One of the biggest problems facing anthropologists in Central and Eastern Europe is the need to define themselves as a discipline separate from any other.

== Central Europe ==
Anthropology in central European countries has its roots in [[Germany]]. The establishment of anthropology within central Europe has been a slow process that involved first understanding what the discipline was and then determining how it fit within each country's individual ideals.

Anthropology in [[Slovenia]] has been greatly influenced by surrounding nations due to the country's small size.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50204263|title=Educational histories of European social anthropology|last=|first=|date=2003|publisher=Berghahn Books|others=Dracklé, Dorle., Edgar, Iain R., Schippers, Thomas K., 1954-|year=|isbn=1571819053|location=New York|pages=116, 140|oclc=50204263}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a shift in language after [[World War II]] that caused German language to be controversial so [[English language|English]] began being taught to children which later resulted in students being more interested in an ethnographic college curriculum.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The [[University of Ljubljana]] started offering anthropology courses in 1933 which were taught by [[Božo Škerlj]] as the first college professor to teach the subject in Slovenia.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Later, he created a chair in anthropology at the University of Ljubljana in 1946 that was eventually placed within the [[biology]] department; but, within a few years of his [[death]] in 1961, the subject became questioned which resulted in its being terminated.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; However, [[social anthropology]] was already part of the [[sociology]] [[curriculum]] which was established earlier in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It wasn't until the 1990s that this branch of anthropology became an official program offered to graduate students.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

[[Božo Škerlj]] was an Austrian-born anthropologist who studied [[physical anthropology]] in [[Prague]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; He was initially interested in [[Germans|German]] physical anthropology but, at the time of [[World War II]], decided to focus on [[cultural anthropology]] instead.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; His work reflected a combination of the two topics.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Another important figure in Slovene anthropology is Niko Županić who was born in 1876.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slovenska-biografija.si/oseba/sbi915246/|title=Županič, Niko (1876–1961) - Slovenska biografija|last=umetnosti|first=Slovenska akademija znanosti in|website=www.slovenska-biografija.si|language=si|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the creator of the Slovene Ethnographic Museum, which opened in 1923, and the museum’s corresponding journal, ''Etnolog'', that began in 1926.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; His educational background was in [[physical anthropology]], [[archaeology]], and [[history]] and, in 1940, he became a professor for the ethnology and ethnography department at the [[University of Ljubljana]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Niko Županić died on September 11, 1961.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

&lt;small&gt;December 22, 1815 -November 25, 1887&lt;/small&gt;
]]
The discipline of [[anthropology]] in [[Switzerland]], like Austria, is closely tied to [[Germany]] and German-speaking countries in general.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; Swiss anthropology originated with studying [[folklore]], also known as [[volkskunde]], and ethnology, or völkerkunde.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Between 1912 and 1916, ethnographic museums held seminars in [[ethnology]] and folklore and were the beginning of anthropology being taught in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

[[Johann Jakob Bachofen]], born in 1815, was a professor at the [[University of Basel]], criminal court judge, member of city legislative council, and an anthropological writer.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/645093022|title=Myth, Matriarchy and Modernity : Johann Jakob Bachofen in German Culture. 1860-1945.|last=Peter.|first=Davies,|date=2010|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=|isbn=9783110227093|location=Berlin|pages=7, 8, 9, 11|oclc=645093022}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came from a wealthy family and was well educated in [[law]], [[Philology]], [[history]] and [[ancient history]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; A popular, influential publication of his, titled [[Das Mutterrecht]], explored past societies with the idea that [[matriarchy]] came before [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Initially it was rejected but was later printed in 1861.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Bachofen published many works but none were accepted until well after his death in 1887.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Eastern Europe ==
Anthropology in Eastern Europe varies in is roots, but many of the different anthropologies share a common interest in folklore and human populations. Eastern European anthropologists, official and non official, tend to focus on studying local issues and staying out of international affairs. The anthropological trend in Eastern Europe is a turn toward the social sciences and anthropology after separation from the [[Soviet Union]].

=== Belarus ===
The first [[Belarus]] postgraduate training program with anthropology was in February 1965 and was at the Institute of Art, Ethnography and Folklore of the Academy of Sciences of the BSSR.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurbo|first=Tatyana|date=2016|title=The Contribution of L.I. Tegako to Anthropology of Belarus|url=|journal=Journal of the Anthropological Society of Serbia|volume=51|pages=81–87|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SB_-_Kazakh_woman_on_horse.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SB_-_Kazakh_woman_on_horse.jpg|thumb|350x350px|'''Kazakh woman on a horse''']]
After separating from the Soviet Union, Belarus went through a period of state development that lasted from about 1990 to 1994. During this time, the focus was on nation-building. This required both an institutional and ideological change from the time when Belarus was under Soviet rule. A policy of “[[Belarusization|Belarusisation]]” was implemented in order to bring back culture and language that was understood to be native to Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bekus|first=Nelly|date=2014|title=Ethnic Identity in Post-Soviet Belarus: Ethnolinguistic Survival as an Argument in the Political Struggle|url=|journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|volume=35|issue=1|pages=43–58|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, anthropological research focused on the characteristics of populations within Belarus, looking at perceived internal “others”. In the 1980s, anthropologists were looking at the genetic structure of human populations based on demographics and environment, along with a study of Belarus’s child population. Belarusian anthropologists also looked outside of Belarus through the Research Institute and Museum of Anthropology from [[Moscow State University]] in order to study the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], [[Eskimo]]s, [[Kazakhs]], and [[Khakas people|Khakas]] peoples.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

One important figure in Belarusian anthropology was L.I. Tegako, who is cited as being one of its founders in the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; She began research on ethnic health issues in the 1960s, which is one of the first instances of an official sort of anthropology in Belarus. Her teacher was V.P. Alekseev of Russia. From her research, she concluded that “Belarusians manage to stay within variations which are typical for Caucasian race.” Tegako took part in much of the work in the 1980s on both the genetic structure of human populations and the child studies. She also led twenty expeditions outside of Belarus.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Lidiya Ivanovana is also an important character in Belarusian anthropology. She obtained her PhD in Russia in 1990 with a dissertation that looked at populations in Belarus. Her work was the first to take a multi-dimensional approach involving different types of materials from several different populations within Belarus. Ivanovana is attributed as having contributed many of the anthropological methods used in Belarus.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Bulgaria ===
[[File:NBU_blue.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NBU_blue.jpg|thumb|'''New Bulgarian University''']]
Anthropology appeared in an official status in [[Bulgaria]] in late 1989 due to the fall of the [[Communist Regime|communist regime]] and is thought to be a product of democratization of society. The first departments to include something like anthropology were departments of ethnology, which were concerned with ethnography and folklore, and were worked in to the departments of [[philology]] or history. Anthropology itself was introduced at [[New Bulgarian University]] (NBU) as a priority, but they had to combine with a discipline recognized by the state, which like in many other cases, was the department of sociology with the degree being a sociology one. It wasn’t until around 2004 that anthropology got its own department with its own degree in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

One of Bulgarian anthropology’s main focuses at first was to carve out their own niche as a discipline, especially considering that Bulgarian anthropologists come from a variety of backgrounds. They were also left with ideas from the socialist period and the fall of communism. There was also focus on the changing social conditions from the period of transition after the fall of communism. There was push for democratization in Bulgaria, and anthropology became something of a symbol for that change.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Despite this, there was still polarization on methods and ideology within the new discipline based on debates about Soviet versus Western styles of education, which were understood to be ideological opposites. The shift was eventually toward Western ideas. Bulgarian anthropologists tend to focus on research within their own borders, but also research in [[Balkans]]. Despite the branching out of Bulgaria, there are a limited number of field-research sites, a limited number of subjects, and a limited number of methods taken advantage of by Bulgarian anthropologists. Much attention is paid to community formation, complex societies, power, polity, statehood, nationalism, myth, ritual, religion, marriage, kinship, ethnicity, nation-hood, magic, medicine, and multiculturality.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Czech Republic ===
[[File:LocationCzechRepublic.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LocationCzechRepublic.png|thumb|250x250px|'''Location of Czech Republic on the map''']]
The [[Czech Republic]] takes a constructivist approach to anthropology (closely connected to ethnology), which they take a positivist approach to.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jakoubek|first=Marek|date=2016|title=Anthropology in Eastern Europe Between Positivism and Constructivism: A Case from the Czech Republic|url=|journal=Anthropological Notebooks|publisher=Slovene Anthropological Society|volume=22|issue=3|pages=25–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnology is taken to be trying to get at objective truth, where anthropology is getting at social constructs and beliefs. Despite this split between ideas of ethnology and anthropology in the Czech Republic, anthropology is not yet a fully established discipline. After the split from communism in 1989, there was a turn to socio-cultural anthropology in the way of ideology, but it was inconsistent. Some academics saw it as the same thing as ethnology, while others thought of it as a different research field with different methods and traditions, which resulted in the difficulty of establishing anthropology as a discipline. Many argue for there being a real epistemological difference between the two approaches.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== Hungary ===
[[Hungary|Hungarian]] anthropology is a defined discipline with its own departments and methods, though there is still overlap between anthropology and other related departments, like history and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keen|first=Mike|last2=Mucha|first2=Janusz|date=|title=Sociology in Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990s: A Decade of Reconstruction|url=|journal=European Societies|volume=6|issue=2|pages=123–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian anthropology places a premium on verifying sociological and anthropological results with scientific data.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bokonyi|first=Sandor|last2=Hofer|first2=Tamas|last3=Kiszely|first3=Istvan|last4=Szepe|first4=Gyorgy|last5=Maday|first5=Bela|date=February 1970|title=On Hungarian Anthropology|url=|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=11|issue=1|pages=61–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the ''Ethnographic Research Group'', which was attached to the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] was founded. It was led by [[Gyula Ortutay]] and had twenty-two participating members. The research focused on Hungarian folklore, but the group also looked at peasant economy, social institutions, and Siberian tribal society. If a senior member had an interest outside of Hungary, then that was also a permissible research topic.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Cultural Anthropological departments were established at the [[University of Budapest]] in 1990 and the [[University of Miskolc]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63116730|title=Three social science disciplines in Central and Eastern Europe : handbook on economics, political science and sociology, 1989-2001|date=2002|publisher=Social Science Information Centre (IZ)|others=Kaase, Max., Sparschuh, Vera., Wenninger, Agnieszka., Gesellschaft Sozialwissenschaftlicher Infrastruktureinrichtungen., Collegium Budapest.|isbn=3820601392|location=Berlin|oclc=63116730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many places to publish anthropological works within Hungary. The majority of the work is published in languages other than Hungarian and appear mostly in European periodicals. Many of the works do not appear in American anthropological journals due to a gap in how things are understood between the two anthropological fields. Many Hungarian anthropologists believe that the methods and problems that they need to consider are within their own borders or within their own region. They tend to stay out of international problems and direct their funding toward internal concerns.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Bela C. Maday points out that communication is not a strong suit for Hungarian anthropologists, which makes communicating ideas with core anthropologists, like those from the U.S. or Western Europe, difficult, but there has been much dispute on this point.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Russia ===
[[File:Russian_Academy_of_Sciences_SPB.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Russian_Academy_of_Sciences_SPB.jpg|thumb|'''[[Russian Academy of Sciences]]''' in Saint Petersburg]]
The beginnings of anthropology in [[Russia]] can be traced back to the establishment of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] under [[Peter the Great]] in 1725.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Following the Academy of Sciences, many museums were also created with the impetus for studying culture, including the Ethnographic Bureau of the [[Russian Geographical Society]] in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The 1840s also saw the creation of [[physical anthropology]] and [[archaeology]] as sub-disciplines of anthropology.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In 1864 the first university department for anthropology in Russia was created at [[Moscow University]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The first specialized journal for Russian anthropology, (trans.) The Ethnographic Review ([http://journal.iea.ras.ru/en/index.htm Etnograficheskoe obozrenie]), was created in 1889.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; As Russia did not have state-supplemented funding in the 19th century, much of the financial support came from aristocrats such as Count [[Aleksey Uvarov]] and Prince V. N. Tenishev.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
[[File:Kunstkamera_(Peter_the_Great_Museum_of_Anthropology_and_Ethnography)_in_Saint_Petersburg_3.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kunstkamera_(Peter_the_Great_Museum_of_Anthropology_and_Ethnography)_in_Saint_Petersburg_3.jpg|thumb|276x276px|'''Kunstkamera''' (Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography) in Saint Petersberg]]
In the early 20th century, St. Petersburg and Moscow would be centers for the development of anthropology—focused on ethnology and ethnography—with the formation of the Department of Ethnology in Leningrad (1928), Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (1924), the publication of the journal ''Ethnography'' (1926), the Anuchin Institute of Anthropology at the University of Moscow (1922), etc. Anthropology in Russia was also influenced by Western anthropological perspectives, such as [[Franz Boas]].

Following the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] takeover, Russia began to favor ethnology over anthropology. Ethnology was the study of different ethnic groups within the state, which supported the push for homogenization and national unification of the Russian state. [[Marxism|Marxist theory]] replaced Western anthropological theory, and various university departments were closed as Russia experienced an ideological reconstruction.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In the mid-20th century, with undercurrents of the [[Cold War]], social and cultural anthropology were rejected from ethnographic study, but ethnography was re-institutionalized and strengthened in universities and institutions across Russia.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the latter half of the 20th century, Russian ethnography to other parts of the world in which Soviet influence was strong, such as [[Eastern Europe]]. The [[Perestroika]] in 1985 led to another bout of reconstruction for anthropology, and Russian science in general. Institutes were renamed and reconfigured to match this new trend. Social anthropology also began to make a comeback, leading to identity problems for social anthropology as a discipline in a country with such a strong ethnographic tradition that had excluded it for years.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The 1990s, a time of great social and political change for Russia with the end of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], were a time for critical introspective views on the recent past.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; With this, Russian anthropology turned towards more contemporary interests, where it still is today. Even with these contemporary interests, Russian anthropology still finds itself heavily influenced by the ethnology of its past and attempting to reconcile what it means to be a “social” anthropologist in this environment.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Anthropology of the Arab World ==
The discipline of [[anthropology]] is not new to the [[Arab world]]. While there were no established anthropological institutions until the 20th century, scholars such as [[Abu Rayhan al-Biruni]] and [[Ibn Khaldun]], are recognized for their contribution to the discipline as early as the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ata.org.tn/fichier_PDF/tsr5-2012-chaabani.pdf|title=Insights on the history of Anthropology|last1=Chaabani|first1=Hassen|website=ata.org|publisher=International Journal of Modern Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egypt]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], and the [[Persian Gulf]] region have received most of the scholarly attention, with a particular focus on [[nationalism]] and the state. The Arab youth are a growing area of interest for anthropologists in the [[Arab world]]. Comparatively little research is done in [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], the [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Iraq]]. This is in part a result of accessibility and the conditions of the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That status of anthropology in the Arab world would be labeled as peripheral in relation to anthropology in other regions of the world.

== Middle East ==

=== Iran ===
The man known as the father of Iranian Anthropology was named [[Sadegh Hedayat]] (1903-1951). His focus was on folklore. In 1937, an institute of ethnology was founded in Iran, which then closed in 1941. It then reopened with the rise to power of [[Mohammed Reza Shah]]. From 1956 to 1959, it published a journal titled "Majalle-ye Mardomshenasi" (Journal of Anthropology). In 1957, the first anthropological elective course offered at a college level in Iran began at the [[University of Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shahshahani|first1=Soheila|date=1986|title=History of Anthropology in Iran|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=19|issue=1|pages=65–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, there was not as much of an emphasis placed on receiving degrees from foreign universities. Similarly, international research was also not highly valued. International study and research, however, has begun gaining more and more importance within the departments of anthropology in Iran. Anthropology in Iran suffers from a poor reputation in the public sphere. It is considered to be a weak discipline, according to Iranian anthropologist, [[Soheila Shahshahani]]. Perhaps because of this, most students of the social sciences tend to choose other disciplines, such as law, management, and psychology. As society changes, more attention is being paid to the field. Today, ethnographic research in the area focused on internal subjects, such as the pastoralists living in the arid areas around Iran. These studies continue today, but other fields of interest have started to emerge. A new focus on small town life and rural areas has recently developed. Professor Shahshanani states that the weakness of current anthology in Iran is the lack of theoretical work done by its practitioners. She also goes on to say that these issues could be solved by getting Iranian anthropologists who have trained elsewhere to come back and practice in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dominguez|first1=Virginia|last2=Metzner|first2=Emily|title=An Interview With Iranian Anthropologist Soheila Shahshahani|journal=American Anthropologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Levant ==

=== Lebanon ===
The department of sociology at the [[American University of Beirut]] was the first to offer an anthropology course, which is listed in its 1950-51 catalogue. The department of anthropology was officially founded in the 1970s, and saw 33 students graduate with a Master of Arts degree in anthropology throughout that decade. The [[Lebanese Civil War]], which lasted from 1975-1990, interfered with the development of the department and anthropology at the university saw a decline as a direct result. During this time, the new department of social and behavioral sciences (SBS) which already encompassed sociology, psychology, and communication, absorbed the anthropology department.&lt;ref name="Anthropology in Beirut"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/873907/Anthropology_in_Beirut|title=Anthropology in Beirut|last1=King|first1=Diane E|last2=Scheid|first2=Kirsten|website=academia|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, records show just one student having graduated with a Master of Arts degree in anthropology, while there were none in the 1990s. There were three anthropologists on the faculty throughout this time. Among them were Fuad Khuri, Martha Mundy, and Gerald Obermeyer.

A survey conducted in 1989 by Seteney Shami, a 1976 graduate of the BA program in anthropology at the American University in Beirut, sought to learn more about the teachings of anthropology at universities in the Arab world. Her findings suggested that the role of the discipline in the Arab world were minimal. In an academic report that came out in 2006, anthropologists at the same university claim to have found little evidence in the local community of any significant changes since.

Today's anthropology graduates in Lebanon have opportunities to work with local NGOs. However, for those interested in pursuing anthropology as a discipline, the West still stands as the one destination for that. Anthropology departments at the American University in Beirut, and in Lebanon, are stifled by war.&lt;ref name="Anthropology in Beirut"/&gt;

As a destination for anthropologists to do research, Lebanon is among the top spots for emerging scholars in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palestine ===
Palestine has seen an increase in research conducted in the territory and among the Paletinian communities in Isarel, as well as refugee camps in neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Palestinian anthropology can be marked by four modes of ethnographic engagement: Biblical Palestine, Oriental Palestine, Absent Palestine, and Post-Structural Palestine.

'''Biblical Palestine''' refers to the main method of ethnographic engagement of Palestine which took place in the first decades of the 20th century. Led predominately by Europeans, their interest was motivated by the use of the Bible as a legitimizing text to influence the region. Early work consisted of European writers fetishizing and romanticizing the land and the people based on the Biblical figures.

'''Oriental Palestine''', a term coined by a Palestinian scholar (find scholar, cite) was the leading mode of engagement throughout the first four decades of the 20th century. It was marked by a sense of urgency to document Palestine as a source of Europe's beginnings. Through this lens, a narrative was offered that challenged the colonial British vision of Palestinian history which saw the Arabs there as "transient and ephemeral". It was also marked by a sense of duty among others to capture the traditional fabric of Palestine before it's dissolution, which appeared evident at the time due to the events surrounding the rise of Zionism.

'''Absent Palestine''' follows immediately after the demise of Palestine in 1948, and can only be fully understood in terms of the success of Zionism. In this sense, the state of Palestine was eclipsed by the narrative of Israel as a place offering a safe haven to endangered refugees from Europe. This ethnographic silence of Palestinians is seen as the turning point in Israel's image of modernity.

'''Post-Structural Palestine''' is the current main method of ethnographic engagement. It is known primarily for its stance that challenges and brings to question Israel's efforts to repress Palestinian nationalism. The movement has seen a rising trend in which the Palestinian subject is explored for their national identity, rather than silenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-anthro-081309-145910|title=The Ethnographic Arriving of Palestine|last1=Furani|first1=Khaled|last2=Rabinowitz|first2=Dan|website=annualreviews.org|publisher=Review in Advance|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkey ===
Anthropology as a discipline in Turkey can trace its roots back to 1925. Developing in an nationalistic atmosphere, The Anthropology Institute, otherwise known as The Center for Anthropological Research in Turkey, was established on that year within the Faculty of Medicine at the [[University of Istanbul]]. From 1925 to the 1960s, the main topics of research centered around studies of rural and village life, with a focus on nation building. In the 1960s, a series of military coups occurred, causing considerable changes to the field and to academia itself. It was not until the year 1997 that the first official department of anthropology was established in Turkey, at the private [[Yeditepe University]] in Istanbul. As of 2010, 6 of the 53 state universities in Turkey offered training in anthropology. In contrast to this, only one of the 24 private universities offer similar training. The first anthropological association in Turkey was founded in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Other People's Anthropologies: Ethnographic Practice On The Margins|last1=Bošković,|first1=Aleksandar|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|pages=110–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persian Gulf ==

=== Saudi Arabia ===
Many Anthropologists investigate the tribal system in Saudi Arabia. Anthropology was not popular in many countries; however, the Universities in Saudi Arabia are adopting Anthropology. 
* What is the opposite of the impression of tribes is the ideology of regression. The idea that the tribe gets its meaning from the patriarchal descent. Which is now called Saudi genealogy. One of the famous genealogy is Hamad Aljassar who dead in 2000(Alshamlan). 
* Golf scholars are interested in how migrants and other racial groups are racialized by the legal system. They are also interested in examining the built environment, the history of the transnational connection and the rapid social change (Deep &amp; Winger).

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Anthropological studies, which are concerned with the privacy of the UAE community with a tribal background are rare and limited.
* Most of the studies are written with other international anthropologists such as the ethnographic observations of a British Anthropologists Bertram Thomas.
Tribes are the most form of UAE. Many anthropologists are interested in investigating the form of tribes. Many of the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] are also based on the tribal system.
* Moreover, there are many migrants in UAE from two sides: The first side is the center and the south of the Arabian Peninsula. The second side of the eastern coast of the [[Persian Gulf]], contains many foreign migrations from the neighboring countries of Asia.There are also migrants from Iran. The main intention of those migrants is settling in UAE.
* The UAE community is a multi-tribal community. A multi-cultural community that divides communities into socially and economically linked in different sectors of the workforce(Alsnagry).

=== Qatar and Bahrain ===
In Qatar and Bahrain, anthropology was not as popular as other fields, like many other countries in the Persian Gulf region. Anthropology is expanding in educational aspect. Many anthropologists are also concerned on the structure of the tribes in the Arab countries in the Persian Gulf region (Gardner).

== North Africa ==

=== Egypt ===
Within the Arab-majority countries, [[Egypt]], has established itself among the other Arab-majority countries as the main hub for anthropologists in the region, with [[Cairo]] being the center for most of this attention. The rest of the country remains relatively understudied. Increased attention to [[Cairo]] can be attributed to the rise of anthropological interest in cities, particularly to the diverse interdisciplinary scholarship.

The centrality of Middle East area studies is largely responsible for the increase in anthropological attention towards Egypt. In addition to this is the accessibility of institutional support for US scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the early 21st century, the relationship of Egypt with anthropology remains under question. Egyptian anthropologist, [[Hania Sholkamy]], remarks that there are four main points that shape this ongoing relationship: the relationship of methods to theory, the relationship between methods and their analysis, the relationship of culture to its determinants, and the relationship between having data and being able to evaluate it.

The discipline of anthropology is in a constant state of judgment within Egypt, particularly when compared with the discipline of demography. The qualitative data more common in demography is given more attention than the theoretical and analytical methods associated with anthropology.

=== Morocco ===
In Morocco, topics of anthropological research include the ethnicization of Jews, the construction of ethnicity among Berber, Arab, and Haratine groups through agricultural practices, and how Berber ethnicities are politicized in ways that create raced and gendered notions of homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar_Politics_of_Middle_East_Anthropology.pdf|title=Anthropologies of Arab-Majority Societies|last1=Deeb|first1=Laura|last2=Winegar|first2=Jessica|website=anthropology.northwestern.edu|publisher=The Annual Review of Anthropology|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==
The region of Africa has had a long history of being colonized by others in economic and cultural ways, which is why the study of anthropology in Africa is a relatively new discipline that is usually grouped with historical work. Before becoming a discipline in the region, Western anthropologists came to the area to study and conduct ethnographies pertaining to the native culture of those who inhabited the area. Anthropologists in African academia are still on looking for what anthropology means to them.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nyamnjoh|first=F.|date=2012|title=Blinded by Sight: Divining the Future of Anthropology in Africa|url=|journal=Institute of African Affairs at GIGA,|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While anthropology was initially used by states to gain knowledge about local cultures, it was later seen as a way to help them. After the recognition of its importance many universities and associations have institutionalized departments, journals and conferences to carry out this work.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62324831|title=World anthropologies : disciplinary transformations within systems of power|others=Ribeiro, Gustavo Lins., Escobar, Arturo, 1951-|isbn=9781845201913|location=Oxford, UK|oclc=62324831}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article includes the history, development, and future of African Anthropology in different regions.

==== Growth and Development ====

The growth and development of anthropology in Kenya was largely due to colonialism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but as an actual discipline in the region, it wasn’t well developed until the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacClancy|first=Jeremy|date=2009-07-01|title=Other People's Anthropologies: Ethnographic Practice on the Margins.

Kenya]]'', which was the first time any article was published from a native’s perspective.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The methodology of anthropology in Kenya is neither strictly Kenyan, nor is it strictly Euro-American, but rather a combination of the various methods between the nations.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Due to the variety of methods that were being taught worldwide, as well as the education development in Kenya, it was decided to create formal training for the discipline.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; There’s evidence of this from their two major universities of the [[University of Nairobi]] and [[Moi University]].&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The University of Nairobi tended to disciplines of archaeology and anthropology, but taught them as separate departments, similar to England’s separation of the departments; and Moi University tended to the same disciplines of archaeology and anthropology, but taught the disciplines together in the same department of Anthropology, as is taught in the U.S.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

==== British and German Studies ====

The majority of British, as well as German, anthropologists dominated Kenya with their studies focusing solely on the groups of people who were considered to be distinct, or “otherly”.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; While some anthropologists studied these groups in order to achieve dominance over them, other anthropologists reasoned studying the communities for educational purposes before their culture no longer existed due to colonizing.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Thus, causing a means for Kenya anthropologists to disassociate with colonialism because of its harsh effects on Africans and their culture.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; This forced the local anthropologists to rethink about socio-cultural studies, including their own discipline and how it aided in colonialism.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Even Jomo Kenyatta, who had benefited from his education and studies, was struggling with the decision on whether to associate with the discipline anymore.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

[[Louis Leakey]] aided in bringing archaeology and physical anthropology to light in Kenya. He work as a curator in the [[National Museums of Kenya|Coryndon Memorial Museum]], which is an important establishment that helps to keep excavation sites accessible, such as [[Koobi Fora]], [[Olorgesailie]], and the [[Hyrax Hill Prehistoric Site and Museum|Hyrax Hill]], to both local and foreign archaeologists.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In the 1950s, alongside his wife, Leakey found various primate fossils, including those of [[Paranthropus boisei|Australopithecus Boisei]] (1959), [[Homo habilis|Homo Habilis]] (1964), and [[Kenyapithecus]] (1967).&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In 1960, he established the [http://www.primateresearch.org/ Institute of Primate Research] (IPR) which helped in comprehending human evolution and biomedical research for health challenges in Africa, such as HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

[[File:Daniel_arap_Moi_1979b.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Daniel_arap_Moi_1979b.jpg|thumb|230x230px|Daniel Arap Moi]]
Since the discipline of anthropology was associated with colonialism, the nation-state of Kenya did not identify with its trajectories and could not support it.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; It wasn’t until [[Daniel arap Moi|Daniel Arap Moi]], who succeeded Jomo as president, made culture a central means for socio-economic aspects, making anthropology slowly begin to gain popularity again among locals due to its national cultural ethos.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In 1965, the [[University of Nairobi]] established its Institute for Development Studies which contained two aspects of social science and cultural divisions.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The social science aspect of the department went on to develop its own Institute of Development Studies, which carried out economic development but through a multidisciplinary approach.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The cultural divisions aspect used resources that informed university students, as well as regionally, from a cultural instruction perspective.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In 1970, the two subjects came together and were known as the [[Institute of African Studies]] (IAS), in which students researched in African archaeology, history, social anthropology, musicology, linguistics, oral literature, traditional arts, crafts, and social systems;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogot|first=B.E.|date=1999|title=Building on the Indigenous: Selected Essays 1981-1998|url=|journal=Kisumu: Anyange Press|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this institute even contributed to some of the top scholars such as musicologists [[P.N.

==== Anthropological Future ====

The future of the discipline of anthropology consists of research projects dedicated to resolving health issues, such as malaria and HIV/AIDS, so it’s not a surprise that most anthropologists in Kenya today are either medical anthropologists or those anthropologists who study medical issues.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Many of these local anthropologists are sought out for help by national non-government health organizations, like [[United States Agency for International Development|United State Agency for International Development]], [[Family Health International]], [[EngenderHealth|Engenderhealth]], [[PATH (global health organization)|PATH]], [[Population Council]], [[African Population and Health Research Center]], [[African medical and research foundation|African Medical Research Foundation]], the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Kenyan anthropologists do not conduct research for personal needs, but for needs of their nation-state and those funding agencies that they provide information to for health resolutions.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In response to this upcoming need, universities are developing programs, like Anthropology in Developing Countries, Applied Anthropology, Medical Anthropology, and  Anthropology and Infectious Diseases, that educate for cultural developmental skills.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

The [[University of Yaoundé I|University of Yaoundé-I]] is a main institution in the area providing students with opportunities to gain degrees in Anthropology.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; Other Institutions of importance are the [[University of Ngaoundéré|University of Ngaoundere]] and the [[University of Buea]] which in 1992 added anthropology departments.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Both of these universities produce scholars from the local communities and they promote research that is of common interest to the area. Language being a barrier in academia until its independence, in 1960, where universities were fashioned in the European style of education systems.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; The University of Buea, a public university, offered the subjects in the English language which increased the number of local students that attend. Largely associated with sociology, the first person to gain a PhD in [[Social anthropology|Social Anthropology]] from Cameroon was Paul Nkwi in 1975.

==== History ====

The history of the discipline of anthropology in South Africa comes from the result of political and ideological interpretations of the research there.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spiegel|first=Andrew D.|last2=Becker|first2=Heike|date=2015-12-01|title=South Africa: Anthropology or Anthropologies?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aman.12353/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=117|issue=4|pages=754–760|doi=10.1111/aman.12353|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the [[South African Association for the Advancement of Science]] was established, and it was here that anthropology was known.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Presentations were given by archeologists, linguists, anthropologists, and ethnologists; there was also a South African Journal of Science that many researchers published in as well.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; During the years of the 1940s to the 1990s, anthropology grew to be less popular due to the [[apartheid]] period, which in educators had strict guidelines as to what they could and couldn’t teach in the classroom, and they were not permitted to teach anything else but that particular curriculum.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Anthropological studies and research were offered at sixteen different universities, in which [[sociocultural anthropology]] and [[archaeology]] were offered within the discipline, and in another department, [[linguistics]], [[African studies]], and [[Gender studies]] were linked in the discipline.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Instead of using the word or teaching anthropology, the universities, more specifically [[Stellenbosch University]], taught [[Volkskunde|''volkekunde'']], which means knowledge about people, and it was first known from pre-WWII German passage that was written by [[wiktionary:Völkerkunde|Völkerkunde]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; This expansion of the discipline was also known as [[ethnology]] or [[cultural anthropology]], and it was paired with aspects of the apartheid period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://read.dukeupress.edu/lookup/doi/10.1215/9780822387107-012|title="Today We Have Naming of Parts"|last=Kuper|first=Adam|pages=277–299|language=en|doi=10.1215/9780822387107-012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a division between social anthropology and volkekunde, as well as Afrikaans-medium universities and English-medium universities, respectively.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

==== Stellenbosch University and South African Relationship with the U.K. and U.S. ====

[[Stellenbosch University]] (an Afrikaan-medium university) had established its first anthropological department due to [[Max Eiselen|Werner Eiselen]], who was the Permanent Secretary in the National Department of Native Affairs, as well as being a developer of the concept of apartheid, with [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] being his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Todd|date=1998|title=Review of Imperfect Interpreters: South Africa's Anthropologists 1920-1990|jstor=3034850|journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|volume=4|issue=4|pages=811–812|doi=10.2307/3034850}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were then new universities that were built in the 1960s, specifically for black students, which led to the continuation of the two types of universities within the area.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The professors who obtained jobs at the new universities had a background that dealt with a volkekunde style of teaching anthropology. This entire movement didn’t appeal to those who identified themselves as social anthropologists in the discipline.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Even with this division of the methods to anthropological research, there was a mutual respect and influence for social anthropological studies that were being conducted by researchers in the U.K., as well as the U.S. Most students were moving on to proceed in getting their doctoral degrees preferred to attend the [[University of Cambridge]], due to its influence of academia through anthropologists who were South African natives, such as [[Meyer Fortes]], [[Isaac Schapera]], and [[Max Gluckman]]. South African anthropologists, such as [[Jean Comaroff]] and [[John Comaroff]] and Namibian-born Rob Gordon, who began their studies in their home region of South Africa, and more specifically at the Afrikaans-medium University of Stellenbosch, also had influence with the U.S. in their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Robert|date=2014-04-03|title=Inside African anthropology: Monica Wilson and her interpreters|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23323256.2014.940183|journal=Anthropology Southern Africa|volume=37|issue=1-2|pages=135–138|doi=10.1080/23323256.2014.940183|issn=2332-3256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Self-Exile and Volkekunde Conference ====

[[File:The_University_of_South_Africa.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_University_of_South_Africa.jpg|thumb|290x290px|The University of South Africa]]
In the 1960s, South African anthropologists made the decision to start leaving their country for careers and research studies because of the apartheid methods, the inequality within their societies, and there was an increase in the violence that was surrounding the region. In 1967, a committee was formed in order to begin negotiating anthropological conferences that were held at the [[University of South Africa]], which added to the separation and tension of the social anthropologists and those who studied volkekunde.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Ten years later, black anthropologists started to attend these conferences, and this made the volkekunde group to initiate another new conference that was only to host research projects to those studying ethnology; this new conference was known in the [[Afrikaans]] language as ''Vereniging van Afrikaanse Volkekundiges'', which is translated to mean [[Association of Afrikaans Ethnologists]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; This conference excluded entry to those who did not speak the original Afrikaans language of South Africa, or the regional state area, and it continued to have majority and favor until the 1980s when the social anthropologists decided to have their own conference as well.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

==== Social Anthropology Conference ====

[[The Association for Anthropology in Southern Africa]] (AASA) was established in 1987 excluded membership into the group for those who believed in the apartheid concepts. Before anyone could become members of the conference, they were to sign a document, or a contract, saying that they reject any and all apartheid theories and concepts.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Regardless of this new conference, the methods of volkekunde remained to be prominent in the discipline of anthropology, though during the 1980s, the anthropology department of then known [[Rand Afrikaans University]], which was one of the newer White Afrikaans-medium universities in the area, officially denounced volkekunde as their way of research, in fact, the entire teaching department of this discipline turned their backs to apartheid concepts entirely.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Later on, [[Stellenbosch University]], which was where the first volkekunde department to be established, was closed down in the mid-1990s. A few years afterward, the discipline of social anthropology was introduced within the Department of Sociology.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

The new association of [http://www.asnahome.org/ Anthropology South Africa] was a cause to link the two distinguished branches of volkekunde and social anthropology. Its first annual conference was in 2001. In 2004, it became one of the founding members of the [https://www.wcaanet.org/ World Council of Anthropology Associations] in Brazil.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; There aren’t very many volkekundiges, or ethnologists, who have membership within the ASnA, nor do most of them attend any of the conferences that are held. A majority of those who do attend the annual conference are young, predominantly black, postgraduate anthropologists, but there are also a growing number of faculty members from the South African University anthropology programs who participate as well.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Though the faculty participation numbers are growing, the overall number of memberships within the ASnA fluctuate from year to year. This is due to postgraduates, who are members only having a membership for a year or two in order to obtain their dissertations.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; There is also a close link between membership and conference attendance, meaning that since the conferences are held in venues that are less accessible or less desirable, this doesn’t attract many anthropologists to participate and fewer people sign up for memberships.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

==== Topics of Research and Publication ====

Some of the topics of research for sociocultural anthropologists in South Africa consist of [[medical anthropology]], mostly concerning the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] in the region, [[development anthropology]], [[urbanism]], science and natural resources, conflict, violence and policing, [[human rights]], [[identity politics]] and belonging, and [[Popular culture studies|popular culture]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; There isn’t much attention paid to subjects, such as [[economic anthropology]], [[state formation]], and [[religion]] and [[religious movements]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Anthropologists at South African universities mostly publish to edited volumes and special theme collections in interdisciplinary and disciplinary journals in their own country, as well as internationally.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; One significant publication venue for South African anthropologists is the journal formerly known as the volkekunde’s Tydskrif van Suid Afrikaanse Volkekunde, which translates to [[Journal of South African Ethnology]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The journal changed its name to [http://www.asnahome.org/ Anthropology Southern Africa] in 2002.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Anthropologists, who studied in Africa and began their research from basic curiosities, cannot be of aid to how the discipline stays in existence.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Anthropology thrived from outside and inside perspectives of the same region or aspect of culture; having a [[Civilizing mission|missions civilisatrice]] perspective divided observer and participant, instead of taking into consideration the culture within the region from the perspectives of those who have lived there.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The aspect of not being able, or not wanting to, collaborate with natives from the country was due to the [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowskian]] model.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Researchers developed their own personal objectives and reasoning to what and who they were observing in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faris|first=Wendy B.|last2=Clifford|first2=James|title=The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth-Century Ethnography, Literature, and Art|jstor=1770355|journal=Comparative Literature|language=en|volume=44|issue=2|doi=10.2307/1770355}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused an explicit division of Africa into several regions based on finding and observing the exotic “Other” from various basis of culture, race, and location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/605/chapter/127376/|title=Beyond "Culture"|last=Gupta|first=Akhil|last2=Ferguson|first2=James|pages=33–51|language=en|doi=10.1215/9780822382089-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Imagining insiders: Africa and the question of belonging|url=http://choicereviews.org/review/10.5860/CHOICE.37-5492|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=37|issue=10|pages=37–5492–37-5492|doi=10.5860/choice.37-5492}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] helped anthropologists to realize that their personal needs and reasoning for research correlated with the aspect of seeing people differently instead of similarly.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; There was no insight from those who had inhabited the continent for centuries, and the country is not well represented.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; There was not a lot of support for methods that contradicted what had already been practiced and known within the discipline.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Universally, there were various debates about the methodology of the discipline in relation to folklore, co-production with aid of natives, and boundaries within the field.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; These aspects had not been taken into consideration when observing the region.

The '''history of women in engineering''' predates the development of the profession of engineering. Before engineering was recognized as a formal profession, women with engineering skills often sought recognition as inventors, such as [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (350 or 370–415 AD), who is credited with the invention of the [[hydrometer]]. During the Islamic Golden Period from 8th Century until 15th Century along with men who were masters in Engineering, philosophy, mathematics, Science,Physics etc., there were also many muslim women who were inventors and engineers much before the european rennaisance. In the 19th century, women who performed engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. [[Ada Lovelace]] (1815–1852) was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning her collaboration with [[Charles Babbage]] on his [[analytical engine]] that would earn her the designation of the "first computer programmer." [[Hertha Marks Ayrton]] (1854–1923), a British engineer and inventor studied mathematics at Cambridge in the 1880s. [[Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu]] (1887–1973) is one of the first female engineers in Europe. In the early years of the twentieth century, a few women were admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as curiosities by their male counterparts.

[[Alice Perry]] was the first woman in [[Europe]] to graduate with a degree in engineering in 1906 from [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Queen's College, Galway]].&lt;ref name="Irish Architectural Archive"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irish Architectural Archive|title=PERRY, ALICE JACQUELINE|url=http://www.dia.ie/architects/view/4332/PERRY-ALICEJACQUELINE|website=Dictionary of Irish Architects 1720-1940|publisher=Irish Architectural Archive|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu]], a Romanian engineer graduated from the [[Technical University of Berlin]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="Amazing Romanians"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cociuban|first1=Anca|title=Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu – First female engineer in the world|url=http://amazingromanians.ro/2014/02/13/elisa-leonida-zamfirescu-first-female-engineer-in-the-world/|website=Amazing Romanians|accessdate=8 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208215432/http://amazingromanians.ro/2014/02/13/elisa-leonida-zamfirescu-first-female-engineer-in-the-world/|archivedate=8 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of the United States into [[World War II]] created a serious shortage of engineering talent as men were drafted into the armed forces. The [[General Electric Corporation|GE]] on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics, and the [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] Engineering Program had "Curtiss-Wright Cadettes"{{r|Bix}}{{Verify source|date=July 2013}} ("Engineering Cadettes", e.g., Rosella Fenton).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=The Penn Stater |title=In Memoriam: Pilot and Physics Teacher |date=July–August 2013 |quote=Fenton...arrived at Penn State in 1942 as part of the '''Curtiss-Wright Engineering Program''', which was training women to replace male engineers who were fighting in World War II.

She later taught physics at Cal State-Sacramento for 38 years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company partnered with Cornell, [[Penn State]], [[Purdue]], the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Texas]], RPI, and [[Iowa State University]] to create an engineering curriculum that eventually enrolled over 600 women. The course lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.&lt;ref name=Bix&gt;Bix, Amy Sue, "'Engineeresses' Invade Campus: Four decades of debate over technical coeducation." ''IEEE Technology and Society Magazine,'' Vol. 19 Nr. 1 (Spring 2000), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kathleen McNulty]] (1921–2006), was selected to be one of the original programmers of the [[ENIAC]]. [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] began to admit women engineering students in 1952. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) had graduated its first female student, [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] (1842–1911) in 1873. The École Polytechnique in Paris first began to admit women students in 1972. The number of BA/BS degrees in engineering awarded to women in the U.S. increased by 45 percent between 1980 and 1994. However, from 1984–1994, the number of women graduating with a BA/BS degree in [[computer science]] decreased by 23 percent.

==Terminology==
Although the terms [[engineer]] and [[engineering]] date from the Middle Ages, they acquired their current meaning and usage only recently in the nineteenth century. Briefly, an engineer is one who uses the principles of engineering – namely acquiring and applying scientific, mathematical, economic, social, and practical knowledge – in order to design and build structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes. Some of the major branches of the engineering profession include [[civil engineering]], [[military engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[computer engineering]], and [[biomedical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= What is engineering and what do engineers do? | work= National Academy of Engineering website FAQ | url= http://www.nae.edu/About/FAQ/20650.aspx | accessdate= 2011-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventors==
Before engineering was recognized as a formal profession, women with engineering skills often sought recognition as inventors. One of the earliest women inventors was [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (350? 370?–415), who is credited with the invention of the [[hydrometer]]. [[Tabitha Babbit]] (1784–1853?) was an American toolmaker who invented the first circular saw.  [[Sarah Guppy]] (1770–1852) was an Englishwoman who patented a design for bridge foundations. [[Mary Dixon Kies]] (1752–1837) was the first American woman to receive a patent for her method of weaving straw in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Autumn, ''Mothers and Daughters of Invention: Notes for a Revised History of Invention'' (Metuchen, NJ and London: Scarecrow Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century: entry into technical professions==
With the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century, new technology-based occupations opened up for both men and women. [[Sarah Bagley]] (1806–?) is remembered not only for her efforts to improved working conditions for women mill workers in Lowell, Massachusetts, in the 1830s and 1840s, but also for being one of the earliest women to work as a telegraph operator. [[Mathilde Fibiger]] (1830–1872), a Danish novelist and advocate of women's rights, became a telegraph operator for the Danish State Telegraph system in the 1860s.

Engineering began to be taught as a formal academic discipline in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The [[École Polytechnique]] in France was established in 1794 to teach military and civil engineering; [[West Point Military Academy]] in the United States established a program modeled after the École Polytechnique in 1819. [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI) began to teach civil engineering in 1828. However, none of these institutions admitted women as students at the time of their founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= No. 1107: Engineering Education | author= John H. Lienhard | work= Engines of our Ingenuity | url= http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1107.htm | accessdate= 2011-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, women who performed engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. [[Ada Lovelace]] (1815–1852), [[Lord Byron]]'s daughter, was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning the collaboration with [[Charles Babbage]] on his [[analytical engine]] that would earn her the designation of the "first computer programmer." [[Hertha Marks Ayrton]] (1854–1923), a British engineer and inventor who helped develop electric arc lighting, studied mathematics at Cambridge in 1880, but was denied a degree, as women were only granted certificates of completion at the time.  Similarly, [[Mary Engle Pennington]] (1872–1952), an American chemist and refrigeration engineer, completed the requirements for a BS degree in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania in 1892, but was given a certificate of proficiency instead.
[https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Morais_de_Sarmento Rita de Morais Sarmento] (1872–1931) was the first woman to obtain an Engineering degree from the Polytechnic Academy of Porto, in Portugal. She obtained this degree in 1894 and latter certified in 1896, which means she may have been the first formally recognised female engineer in Europe.
[[Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu]] (1887–1973) is one of the first formally recognised female engineers in Europe. Due to prejudices against women in the sciences, she was rejected by the School of Bridges and Roads in Bucharest, Romania. However, in 1909, she was accepted at the Royal Academy of Technology in Berlin. She graduated from the university in 1912, with a degree in engineering, specialising in chemistry, possibly becoming one of the first women engineers in the world. Other women in engineering in the same time period include three Danish women: Agnes Klingberg, Betzy Meyer, and Julie Arenholt, who graduated in 1897 and 1901 from 'Polyteknisk Læreanstalt', today known as the Danish Technical University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ida.dk/content/de-foerste-kvindelige-ingenioerer-agnes-og-betzy-pionerer|title=De første kvindelige ingeniører Agnes og Betzy - to pionerer|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Danish Society of Engineers, IDA website|work=|accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first female engineering graduate in Britain was [[Alice Perry]] who graduated from Queen's College, Galway in 1906.

Women without formal engineering degrees were also integral to great 19th century civil engineering feats. Emily Warren Roebling is recognized as managing the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, and was the first person to cross the bridge at its opening ceremony in 1883.&lt;ref name="asce.org"&gt;http://www.asce.org/templates/person-bio-detail.aspx?id=11203&lt;/ref&gt; Roebling's husband, Washington Roebling, worked as the chief engineer for the Brooklyn Bridge project until he fell ill of decompression sickness. Upon her husband's illness, Emily Warren Roebling assumed her husband's duties at the project site, and taught herself about material properties, cable construction, calculating catenary curves, and the like.&lt;ref name="asce.org"/&gt;

==20th century: entry into engineering programs==

In the early years of the twentieth century, a few women were admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as curiosities by their male counterparts. [[Nora Stanton Blatch Barney]] (1883–1971), daughter of [[Harriot Stanton Blatch]] and granddaughter of [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], was the first woman to receive a degree in civil engineering from [[Cornell University]] in 1905. In the same year, she was accepted as a junior member of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]; however, twelve years later, after having worked as an engineer, architect, and engineering inspector, her request for an upgrade to associate membership was denied. [[Olive Dennis]] (1885–1957), who became the second woman to graduate from Cornell with a civil engineering degree in 1920, was initially hired by the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] as a draftsman; however, she later became the first person to claim the title of Service Engineer when this title was created.

[[Alice Perry]] was the first woman in [[Europe]] to graduate with a degree in engineering in 1908 from [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Queen's College, Galway]].&lt;ref name="Irish Architectural Archive"/&gt; [[Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu]], a Romanian engineer graduated from the [[Technical University of Berlin]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="Amazing Romanians"/&gt;

[[Edith Clarke]], the inventor of the graphical calculator, was the first woman to earn a degree in MIT's electrical engineering department in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engineergirl.org/Engineers/HistoricalEngineers/4399.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke also became the first woman admitted to the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]], the precursor to the IEEE. She taught at the University of Texas Austin, where she was the only woman faculty member in the engineering department.

==World War II engineering programs for women==

The entry of the United States into [[World War II]] created a serious shortage of engineering talent as men were drafted into the armed forces at the same time that industry ramped up production of armaments, battleships, and airplanes.  The U.S. Office of Education initiated a series of courses in science and engineering that were open to women as well as men.

Private programs for women included [[General Electric Corporation|GE]] on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics, and the [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] Engineering Program had "Curtiss-Wright Cadettes"{{r|Bix}}{{Verify source|date=July 2013}} ("Engineering Cadettes", e.g., Rosella Fenton).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The company partnered with Cornell, [[Penn State]], [[Purdue]], the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Texas]], RPI, and [[Iowa State University]] to create an engineering curriculum that eventually enrolled over 600 women. The course lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.&lt;ref name="Bix"/&gt;

[[Thelma Estrin]] (1924–2014 ), who would later become a pioneer{{Specify|reason=What did she pioneer?|date=July 2013}} in the fields of computer science and biomedical engineering, took a 1942 three-month engineering assistant course at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] and earned [[University of Wisconsin]] BSc, MSc, and PhD degrees.{{Dubious|reason=This anecdote that she took an engineering assistant course and earning 3 EE degrees doesn't seem to be wikinotable—what did Estrin DO AS AN ENGINEER?|date=July 2013}}

Through an accelerated program brought on by the war, [[Lois Graham]] (1925-2013) graduated from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1946&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rpi.edu/about/alumni/inductees/graham.html|title=Lois Graham, Engineering Education Leader|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first woman in the United States to receive a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (M.S. ME ’49, Ph.D. ’59).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://engineering.iit.edu/news/2014/01/memoriam-lois-graham-ms-me-49-phd-59-iit-armour-college-engineering|title=In Memoriam – Lois Graham (M.S.

==Postwar era==

In 1943, the [[United States Army]] authorized a secret project at the University of Pennsylvania's [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]] to develop an electronic computer to compute artillery firing tables for the Army's [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]]. The project, which came to be known as [[ENIAC]], or Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, was completed in 1946.

Previous to the development of the ENIAC, the U.S. Army had employed women trained in mathematics to calculate artillery trajectories, at first using mechanical desk calculators and later the [[differential analyzer]] developed by [[Vannevar Bush]], at the Moore School. In 1945, one of these "computers", [[Kathleen McNulty]] (1921–2006), was selected to be one of the original programmers of the ENIAC, together with  [[Frances Spence]] (1922– ), [[Betty Holberton]] (1917–2001), [[Marlyn Wescoff]], [[Ruth Lichterman]] (1924–1986), and [[Betty Jean Jennings]] (1924–2011). McNulty, Holberton, and Jennings would later work on the [[UNIVAC]], the first commercial computer developed by the [[Remington Rand Corporation]] in the early 1950s.

In 1946, [[Hattie Scott Peterson]] gained a degree in civil engineering, believed to be the first African-American woman to do so.&lt;ref name="California State Library"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hattie Peterson (1913-1993)|url=http://www.library.ca.gov/calhist/calendar6-1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409134822/http://www.library.ca.gov/calhist/calendar6-1.html?utm_source=csl0613|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 April 2016|website=Library.ca.gov|publisher=California State Library|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance to coeducation in engineering schools, 1950s–1970s==

The Cold War and the space race between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] created additional demands for trained engineering talent in the 1950s and 1960s. Many engineering schools in the U.S. that had previously admitted only male students began to tentatively adopt coeducation. After 116 years as an all-male institution, RPI began to admit small numbers of female students in the 1940s. [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] began to admit women engineering students in 1952, but only in programs not available in other state universities. It would be 1968 before women were admitted to all courses offered by Georgia Tech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Terraso |first=David |title=Georgia Tech Celebrates 50 Years of Women |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology News Room |date=2003-03-21 |url=http://www.gatech.edu/news-room/release.php?id=98 |accessdate=2006-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924111921/http://www.gatech.edu/news-room/release.php?id=98 |archivedate=2006-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="females"&gt;{{cite news|first=Joshua|last=Cuneo|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2003-04-11/focus/3|title=Female faculty, staff offer professional perspectives|date=2003-04-11|accessdate=2007-03-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060110222125/http://www.nique.net/issues/2003-04-11/focus/3 |archivedate = January 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) had graduated its first female student, [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] (1842–1911) in 1873; she later became an instructor at MIT. However, until the 1960s, MIT enrolled few female engineering students, due in part to a lack of housing for women students. After the completion of the first women's dormitory on campus, McCormick Hall, in 1964, the number of women enrolled increased greatly.  Influenced in part by the [[second wave feminism]] movement of the late 1960s and 1970s, female faculty members at MIT, including [[Mildred Dresselhaus]] and [[Sheila Widnall]], began to actively promote the cause of women's engineering education.&lt;ref&gt;Bix, "'Engineeresses' Invade Campus," 25-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The École Polytechnique in Paris first began to admit women students in 1972.

[[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Margaret Hamilton]] is also notable for her contributions to computer and aerospace engineering in the 1970s. Hamilton, the director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory at the time, is famous for her work in writing the on-board guidance code for the Apollo 11 mission.&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@verne/margaret-hamilton-the-engineer-who-took-the-apollo-to-the-moon-7d550c73d3fa#.i1blqgw5r&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s–1990s==

As more engineering programs were opened to women, the number of women enrolled in engineering programs increased dramatically. The number of BA/BS degrees in engineering awarded to women in the U.S. increased by 45 percent between 1980 and 1994. However, during the period of 1984–1994, the number of women graduating with a BA/BS degree in computer science decreased by 23 percent (from 37 percent of graduates in 1984 to 28 percent in 1994). This phenomenon became known as "The incredible shrinking pipeline," from the title of a 1997 paper on the subject by Dr. [[Tracy Camp]], a professor in the Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at the [[Colorado School of Mines]].&lt;ref&gt;Camp, Tracy, "The Incredible Shrinking Pipeline", ''Communications of the ACM'', Vol. 40 Nr. 10 (October 1997), 103–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the reasons for the decline cited in the paper included:
* The development of computer games designed and marketed for males only;
* A perception that computer science was the domain of "hacker/nerd/antisocial" personality types;
* Gender discrimination in computing;
* Lack of role models at the university level.&lt;ref&gt;Camp, T., and Gurer, D., "Women in Computer Science: Where Have We Been and Where are We Going?" ''Proceedings, Women and Technology: Historical, Societal, and Professional Perspectives.'' IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society, New Brunswick, NJ, July 1999, 242–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==

===United States===
According to studies by the [[National Science Foundation]], the percentage of BA/BS degrees in engineering awarded to women in the U.S. increased steadily from 0.4 percent in 1966 to a peak of 20.9 percent in 2002, and then dropped off slightly to 18.5 percent in 2008.  However, the trend identified in "The incredible shrinking pipeline" has continued; the percentage of BA/BS degrees in mathematics and computer science awarded to women peaked in 1985 at 39.5 percent, and declined steadily to 25.3 percent in 2008.

The percentage of master's degrees in engineering awarded to women increased steadily from 0.6 percent in 1966 to 22.9 percent in 2008. The percentage of doctoral degrees in engineering awarded to women during the same period increased from 0.3 percent to 21.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= S&amp;E Degrees: 1966–2008 | work= National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, National Science Foundation | url= https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf11316/content.cfm?pub_id=4062&amp;id=2 | accessdate= 2011-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Digital home ap.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A mid-priced Panasonic Home Theatre in a Box package, which consists of the DVD player, which contains an integrated multi-channel [[power amplifier]], and a set of speakers. The consumer must buy the [[television]] and stand separately.]]
A "'''home theater in a box'''" (HTIB) is an integrated [[home cinema|home theater]] package which "bundles" together a combination  [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray]] player, a multi-channel amplifier (which includes a [[surround sound]] decoder, a [[radio tuner]], and other features), speaker wires, connection cables, a [[remote control]], a set of five or more surround sound speakers (or more rarely, just left and right speakers, a lower-price option known as "2.1") and a low-frequency [[subwoofer]] cabinet.
In 2016,
they are manufactured by most makers of [[consumer electronics]]. Budget HTIB's with generic or lower-price "house" brands (e.g., [[Best Buy]]'s ''Insignia'' line) may be a "2.1" system. Many, however, are a full "[[5.1]]" system and some higher-end packages even have a [[7.1]] system. Some popular manufacturers of HTIB's are [[RCA]], [[Philips]], [[Panasonic]], [[Sony]], [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]], [[LG Corp|LG]] and [[Samsung]], all of which make a variety of mid-price range packages. [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] and [[Onkyo]] make higher-end, higher-priced HTIB packages.

==Market positioning==
HTIBs are marketed as an "all-in-one" way for consumers to enjoy the [[surround sound]] experience of home cinema, even if they do not want to-or do not have the electronics "know-how" to pick out all of the components one-by-one and connect the cables. If a consumer were to buy all of the items individually, they would have to have a basic knowledge of electronics, so they could, for example, ensure that the speakers were of compatible [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] and power-handling for the amplifier. As well, the consumer would have to ensure that they purchased all of the different connection cables, which could include [[HDMI cable]]s, optical connectors, speaker wire, and RCA connectors.

On the downside, most HTIBs lack the features and "tweakability" of [[home cinema|home theater]] components which are sold separately. For example, while a standalone home theater amplifier may offer extensive [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] options, a HTIB amplifier may simply provide a few factory-set EQ presets. As well, while a standalone home theatre subwoofer may contain a range of sound-shaping circuitry, such as a [[Audio crossover|crossover]] control, a phase inversion switch, and a [[parametric equalizer]], a HTIB subwoofer system usually has its crossover point set at the factory, which means that the user cannot change it. In some cases, the factory preset crossover point on an HTIB subwoofer may cause it to sound too "boomy" in a room.

==Features==
A typical HTIB generally consists of a central receiver unit which usually contains a DVD player (some systems separate the DVD player into a separate unit), a multi-channel [[power amplifier]] and a series of speakers for surround sound use, generally including a [[subwoofer]]. Some HTIB systems also have a [[radio tuner]] or an Internet-based streaming audio platform (e.g. [[Spotify]]). The least expensive systems usually have a passive subwoofer, which is amplified by the receiver unit. HTIB systems do not include a [[television set]] or [[video monitor|monitor]] with which to display the visual material or a stand to place the receiver unit on. Beside auxiliary inputs, many of them are equipped today with [[HDMI]] with ARC, optical and [[SPDIF]] inputs. Some HTIB systems are also equipped with a phono input, to allow the connection of a turntable with magnetic cartridge. However such systems are not suitable for vinyl playing as they are mainly focussed on movies and rarely for high fidelity. Some home theaters are just stereo or 2.1, but even so, they are not intended as hi fi, this is just a marketing strategy.

There are systems in this class that are sold without a [[DVD Video|DVD]] player and are designed to integrate with existing video setups where there is already one, such as a DVD recorder or a DVD/VCR combo unit. The speaker cabinets supplied with most systems in this class are generally fairly small compared to typical stereo speakers, and are meant for wall- or shelf-mounting in tight spaces. There are some systems in this class that are supplied with slim freestanding speakers that stand on the floor. This may be typical of higher-priced systems that are equipped with more powerful amplifiers or most of the "receiver-only" packages that do not come with a DVD player.

Some HTIBs use [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] connectors between components, sometimes even combining several different wires into one connector, to reduce cable clutter and increase the ease of installation.  However, this can impede interoperability between different audio/visual devices and makes upgrading certain parts impossible. This may also be used by [[manufacturer]]s to limit what a consumer can do with a low-end model and encourage them to upgrade should they want more autonomy.

A few manufacturers, notably Sony and Panasonic, have implemented wireless connection technology for the [[surround speakers]] in this class of equipment. This technology may be available as standard with some of the high-priced models or may be supplied as an aftermarket kit that only works with selected models in the manufacturer's range. It usually uses a line-level feed over a proprietary wireless link to a separate power amplifier used for the surround-sound channels. This link-receiver and power amplifier can be built into one of the surround speakers or housed in a black box that the surround speakers are connected to. Some higher-end HTIB models offer additional features such as 1080i or 4K ( mainly versions with Blu-ray) video resolution upscaling, a 5-disc platter, HDMI inputs, USB connectivity, Bluetooth support, Wi-fi support, Internet apps, DAB and DAB+, mirroring possibility, iPod dock and a hard disk for recording TV shows.

Some older HTIBs from the 1990s had a built-in VCR, besides a DVD, along with a TV tuner, and a [[hard disk]] for recording TV shows.

'''''Huei tlamahuiçoltica omonexiti in ilhuicac tlatocaçihuapilli Santa Maria totlaçonantzin Guadalupe in nican huei altepenahuac Mexico itocayocan Tepeyacac''''' {{IPA-nah|ˈwei t͡ɬamawisoɬˈtika omoneˈʃiti in ilˈwikak t͡ɬatokasiˈwapilːi ˈsanta maˈɾia tot͡ɬasoˈnant͡sin ɡwadaˈlupe in ˈnikan wei aɬtepeˈnawak meˈʃiko itokaˈjokan tepeˈjakak|}} ("By a great miracle appeared the heavenly queen, Saint Mary, our precious mother of Guadalupe, here near the great [[altepetl]] of [[Mexico City|Mexico]], at a place called [[Tepeyac]]ac") is the title of a [[Tract (literature)|tract]] in [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]], being its opening words. The [[Tract (literature)|tract]] comprises 36 pages and was published in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]] in 1649 by [[Luis Laso de la Vega]], the vicar of the chapel of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] at [[Tepeyac]] outside the same city. It is generally known by the abbreviated title '''''Huei Tlamahuiçoltica''''' ("''The Great Event''"). In the preface [[Luis Laso de la Vega]] claimed authorship of the whole work, but this claim is the subject of an ongoing difference of scholarly opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Particularly, but not exclusively, as regards the part titled the ''Nican Mopohua''. The proponents of Laso's authorship of this part of the work are, by and large, scholars and historians working in the [[United States of America]], including the three authors of the 1998 work cited below. [[Nahuatl]] scholars and historians in [[Mexico]] lean to or accept authorship by [[Antonio Valeriano]]. These include Edmundo O'Gorman (1991) and Miguel León-Portilla (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tract (literature)|tract]] is written almost entirely in [[Nahuatl]] and includes the ''Nican Mopohua'', which narrates the apparitions of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] at [[Tepeyac]] in 1531. 

There is an equally contentious and much shorter manuscript in [[Nahuatl]] preceding the ''Nican Mopohua'', which is titled the ''Inin Huey Tlamahuiçoltzin'' ("''This Is the Great Marvel''"), also known as "''The Primitive Relation''" of the apparitions. It is in The National Library of México.&lt;ref&gt;See Poole, pp. 40-43 etc., who shows that historians variously date it to the 16th, 17th, or 18th century, he himself preferring the latest date.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Huei Tlamahuiçoltica'' also includes the ''Nican Motecpana'', which enumerates the miracles attributed by some to D. Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl;&lt;ref&gt;See Poole, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luis Laso de la Vega]] does not mention either him or [[Antonio Valeriano]] as authors.

The traditions recounted in the 1649 tract were first published in the Spanish book ''Imagen de la Virgen María, Madre de Dios de Guadalupe'' ("Image of the Virgin Mary, Mother of God of Guadalupe"), written by [[Miguel Sánchez]] in 1648 and being a theological dissertation linking the Guadalupan Image to {{bibleref|Revelation|12:1}}.&lt;ref name="leon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=De la Torre Villar|first=Ernesto |author2=Navarro de Anda, Ramiro |title=Testimonios históricos guadalupanos |publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económico |location=México D.F. |year=1982 |oclc=11142386 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sections==

===Preface===
The first section, a [[preface]], is titled in [[Nahuatl]] "Noble Queen of Heaven, Forever Virgin, Mother of God". In it Lasso addresses the Virgin directly, and after an introduction of four to five lines proceeds to the reason why he took up [[Nahuatl]] in order to publish the history of the apparitions:
* "You yourself spoke in [[Nahuatl]] to a poor Indian and painted yourself in his [[ayate]], thus showing you are not displeased with many languages".
* "That the Indians of this land remember and keep in their language all you did for them and how it happened".
* "Christ on the Cross had His sentence in three languages".
* "You were with the apostles in Pentecost to receive the Holy Spirit" (a remembrance of the miracle of Diaspora Jews understanding each in his own language {{bibleref|Acts|2:1-6}})&lt;ref&gt;Although the presence of “Mary, the mother of Jesus” is not explicitly mentioned in ''Acts'' 2:1-6, {{bibleref|Acts|1:14}} states that “[The Apostles] all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.”&lt;/ref&gt;

The preface ends with a short prayer in two lines pleading the Virgin's intercession for the assistance of the [[Holy Spirit]] in writing in [[Nahuatl]].

===''Nican Mopohua''===
[[File:nican-mopohua.jpg|thumb|right|The first page of the ''Nican Mopohua'']]
The second section, the ''Nican Mopohua'' ("Here Is Recounted") constitutes the narrative in [[Nahuatl]] of the apparitions, including the Virgin's apparition to [[St. Juan Diego]]'s uncle [[Juan Bernardino]]. It is probable that the [[Nahuatl]] manuscript used by Lasso was the original by Valeriano, which is presently in the [[New York Public Library]]. Most authorities agree on this and on the dating of its authorship, namely c. 1556, even O'Gorman.&lt;ref name="leon"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tonantzin Guadalupe : pensamiento náhuatl y mensaje cristiano en el "Nicān mopōhua" |first=Miguel |last=León-Portilla |author2=Antonio Valeriano |publisher=Colegio Nacional: Fondo de Cultura Económico |location=Mexico |year=2000 |language=Spanish |isbn=968-16-6209-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Oldest Copy of the Nican Mopohua |first=Ernest J. |last=Burrus S.

====Content, style, and structure====
The ''Nican Mopohua'', which has been described as "A Jewel of Nahuatl literature, whose beauty and depth of thought make it worthy of renown the world over", relies on the beauty of the dialogues between the Holy Virgin and [[St. Juan Diego]] to express the most tender feelings to be found in world literature.  Her promise to grant the wishes of the locals who beseech her is prominent, as is her demand for a temple on the very spot. The ''Nican Mopohua'' section by Valeriano of Lasso de la Vega's account is related in a poetic style, typical of the most elegant formal classical [[Nahuatl]] in its full beauty.  The other parts are clearly different and with greater Spanish influence. The ''Nican Mopohua'' is unique for presenting a blending between the deepest [[Nahuatl]] thought with the Christian message. Scholar Richard Nebel insists that the ''Nican Mopohua'' is not necessarily a historical account, but a document designed to convert the Nahua and "bring about a state of harmony between different peoples, cultures, and religions, in order that, during a period of radical change, new possibilities of coexistence could be envisaged".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nebel|first=Richard|title="The Cult of Santa Maria Tonantzin, Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico." In Sacred Space: Shrine, City, Land|year=1998|publisher=New York University Press|location=Washington Square, NY|pages=253–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is precisely on this point that an abysmal difference exists with other dialogues which invoke elements of the dramatic writings (called ''autos''), many of which were used for the purposes of [[proselytization]] during the Spanish [[Colonialism|colonization]] of [[Mexico]]. The ''autos'' reflect only Spanish Christian thinking, while the main characteristic of the ''Nican Mopohua'' is the exceptional blending of the best of two cultures. Leon-Portilla suggests, "That there is in [the ''Nican Mopohua''] an exposition of key ideas in Christian thinking, wrapped up in the language and form conceived from the world of the Nahua. It is without a doubt that this narrative seeks to demonstrate who God and the Virgin Mary are and that their relations are of kindness and protection for human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leon-Portilla|first=Miguel|title=Tonantzin Guadalupe: Pensamiento Nahuatl y Mensaje Cristiano en el "Nican Mopohua"|year=2000|publisher=D.F., Mexico: El Colegio Nacional Fondo de Cultura Economica|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on the beauty of a miraculous event as given by the ''Nican Mopohua'' can be contrasted with the account of Sánchez, which focuses primarily on the agreements between Indian accounts of the apparition and [[Bible|Biblical]] [[prophecy]], most notably {{bibleref|Revelation|12:1-2,14}} and {{bibleref|Revelation|21:2}}.&lt;ref name="leon"/&gt;

Because the apparition, and the purportedly miraculous transposition of the Virgin's [[Icon|image]] onto Diego's ''[[Tilmàtli|tilma]]'' ("[[Mantle (vesture)|mantle]]") of ''ayatl'', i. e. [[Century plant|maguey]] cloth, are largely credited with the conversion of the Native American ''Mexica'' ([[Aztecs]]) and other peoples of [[Mexico]] to [[Catholicism]], all documents pertaining to the alleged miracle have been the subject of the intense scrutiny of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the colonial [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish Crown]] and after 1820 the [[Politics of Mexico|Mexican government]], scholars of Latin American religion and [[History of Latin America|history]], scholars of classical [[Nahuatl]], and independent Guadalupanos, skeptics, and historians the world over.

====Critical response====
In authorizing the publication of the ''Huei tlamahuiuçoltica'', in an "opinion" published as part of the front matter to the main text, Baltazar González, a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[professor]], [[Nahuatl]] speaker, and contemporary of Laso de la Vega, asserted that the ''Huei tlamahuiçoltica'' "...agrees with what is known of the facts from tradition and the annals."&lt;ref&gt;See text as printed in Sousa et al., p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently, there had been little secular scholarship that questioned the literal or factual nature of the origin of the images or texts.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Some contemporary scholars have written skeptical or critical texts about the origin of the image and the texts.  [[Lisa Sousa|Sousa]], [[Stafford Poole|Poole]] and [[James Lockhart (historian)|Lockhart]], in their 1998 edition and translation, suggested that the most reasonable hypothesis was that Laso de la Vega's core narrative was based on Sánchez's ''Image of the Virgin Mary'', with an early 17th-century engraving by Samuel Stradanus as a secondary source.&lt;ref&gt;Sousa ''et al.'' (1998), pp. 17f, where they review the three possibilities which could explain the literary relationship and conclude "Nevertheless we are not dogmatic on these matters . .  We consider our conclusions on the relationship of the ''Huei tlamahueiçoltica'' and the ''Imagen de la Virgen'' to be more as indicated than as definitively established." Cf. at p. 47: "For the apparition story and the miracle accounts, the most indicated source is the work of Sánchez, supplemented by the Stradanus engraving".&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Catholics, especially those in Mexico and the rest of [[Latin America]], accept the ''Nican Mopohua'', whether written by Laso de la Vega, Valeriano, or another, unknown author, as the primordial telling of the Virgin Mary's personal evangelism to the indigenous peoples of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;What might be termed the "catechetical" aspect of the Guadalupe apparitions as narrated in the ''Nican Mopohua'' is explored by Brading at p. 340f., where he quotes from the homily delivered by [[Pope John Paul II]] in the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] on 6 May 1990 on the occasion of the beatification of Juan Diego, and, more extensively, at pp. 345-351. See also the section below on "The ''Nican Mopohua'' and liberation theology".&lt;/ref&gt;

====The ''Nican Mopohua'' and liberation theology====
According to [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] professor of Mexican history [[David Brading]], "...the romantic engagement with [[folk culture]] that characterized the revolutionary years was eventually taken up by the clergy. Equally important, the effect of the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–1965) and the rise of [[Liberation Theology]] was to convert the text into a potent catechetical instrument, since its emphasis on a poor peasant and his willing acceptance of the Virgin's message, not to mention [Bishop] Zumárraga's initial disdain, responded perfectly to the new-found 'option for the poor'."&lt;ref&gt;Brading (2001) p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description of the image===
The third section is a description of the [[Icon|image]] of the Virgin of Guadalupe as it was exhibited in the chapel of [[Tepeyac]] during Laso de la Vega's day.

==="Nican Motecpana"===
The fourth section, called the "Nican Motecpana" (Nahuatl: "Here is an ordered account"), relates the fourteen [[miracle]]s ascribed to the image of the Virgin that remained stamped on Juan Diego's ''tilma'' after the apparition.

===Biography of Juan Diego===
The fifth section is a post-apparition biography of Juan Diego, detailing his pious life and devotion to the Virgin and her image.

==="Nican Tlantica"===
The sixth section, the "Nican Tlantica" (Nahuatl: "Here ends"), is a general history of the Virgin in [[New Spain]] and an exhortation to her devotion.

===Final prayer===
The seventh section is another prayer, this one following the structure of the ''[[Salve Regina]]''.

==Publication and authorship==
The responsibility for the composition and authorship of the ''Huei Tlamahuiçoltica'' is assigned by a majority{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} of contemporary [[Nahuatl]] scholars and historians to [[Luis Laso de la Vega]], vicar of the chapel at [[Tepeyac]].&lt;ref&gt;Sousa ''et al.'' (1998), pp.42–47.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some possibility that Laso de la Vega had collaborators in the composition of the work, but there is insufficient material evidence to demonstrate whether one or more hands were involved in the construction of the Nahuatl-language text.&lt;ref&gt;Sousa ''et al.'' (1998), pp.46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was initially published under the auspices of Dr. Pedro de Barrientos Lomelín, vicar general of the Mexican diocese, at the press of Juan Ruiz in 1649.

[[File:Matka Boza z Guadalupe.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Our Lady of Guadalupe.]]
In 1666, Lic. [[Luis Becerra Tanco]] (1603–1672), a secular priest, affirmed that the [[Nahuatl]] account was based on long-standing oral tradition in a deposition for the inquiries of Francisco de Siles, who was commissioned to compile documentation of the continuity of the Virgin's popular cult since the time of her apparition. Becerra Tanco later elaborated on this position in his ''Felicidad de México'' ("''Mexico's Happiness''" of 1675, claiming that Laso de la Vega's text must have been based on documents created through collaborations between the [[Franciscan]] faculty of the [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco|College of Santa Cruz Tlatelolco]] and their indigenous pupils shortly after the apparition itself and purported to have been in the custody of [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl]]. He even claimed to have seen among these papers "a manuscript book written in the letters of our alphabet in an Indian's hand in which were described the four apparitions of the Most Holy Virgin to the Indian Juan Diego and his uncle Juan Bernardino."

Other scholars who have disputed Laso de la Vega's authorship include [[Francisco de Florencia]], a Jesuit chronicler, who assumed that the "Indian manuscript" mentioned by Becerra Tanco was written by [[Jerónimo de Mendieta]], (d. 1605), a Franciscan [[missionary]] and [[historian]] in early New Spain, and  [[Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora]], Florencia's censor, who, by way of correction of his charge, swore that he "found this account among the papers of Fernando de Alva. [...] The original in Mexican [Nahuatl] is of the letter of don [[Antonio Valeriano]], an Indian, who is its true author". According to the sworn testimony of D. [[Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora]], the original preprint was in the [[calligraphy]] of [[Antonio Valeriano]], its author. A very old and battered partial manuscript copy of the ''Nican Mopohua'' comprising 16 pages and dated to c. 1556 can be found at the Public Library of New York; it has been there since 1880, together with two later copies, one of which is complete. The older copy appears in the ''Tonanzin Guadalupe'' with full historical details.&lt;ref name="leon"/&gt;

Some contemporary scholars{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} uphold the notion that Becerra Tanco, Florencia, and Sigüenza y Góngora endeavored to authenticate the events of the narrative by placing its original authorship in hands that were both native to Mexico and of greater antiquity than the mid-17th century. Since Mexican petitioners to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] for official recognition of the miracle relied on Sigüenza y Góngora's testimony that the story predated the publication of both the ''Nican Mopohua'' and ''Image of the Virgin Mary'', ecclesiastical writers have continued to cite Valeriano as its author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sancta.org/nican.html|title=The Apparitions and the Miracle|accessdate=2007-09-05|publisher=sancta.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is loosely based on the [[Sengoku period]] or early [[Edo period]] of Japan, despite being set in the present day.

==Plot==
The series takes place in an alternate version of Japan called {{nihongo|Great Japan|大日本国|Dai Nippon-koku}}, in an alternate timeline where the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] remained active and has remained semi isolated from the rest of the world after their defeat by American forces in [[World War II]]. And the Americans have bases on Okinawa and southern great Japan. The story takes place at {{nihongo|Buou Academic School|武應学園塾|Buō Gakuen-juku}}, an academy located at the base of [[Mount Fuji]] where children of military families train to become samurai warriors. The academy is in the middle of a power struggle between Yukimura Sanada and Matabei Goto of the Toyotomi faction and the powerful student council that rules the school, and Muneakira Yagyu, the owner of the Yagyu Dojo, and the mysterious Jubei Yagyu are dragged in the middle of the conflict.

The series features the female warriors descended from the famous historical figures from Japan's [[Sengoku period]] and early [[Edo period]]. The character Charles d'Artagnan also comes from the same age in Europe.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
;{{nihongo|[[Yagyū Munenori|Muneakira Yagyu]]|柳生 宗朗|Yagyū Muneakira}}
:{{animevoices|[[Daisuke Hirakawa]]|[[David Matranga]]}}
:The male protagonist of the series and a childhood friend of Sen, he has the ability, unknown even to him, to create Master Samurai. This power first manifested when he and the naked girl who fell from the sky kissed. He has since gained six additional Master Samurai with one of them becoming a Samurai Bride.

;{{nihongo|[[Yagyū Jūbei Mitsuyoshi|Jubei Yagyu]]|柳生 十兵衛 三厳|Yagyū Jūbei Mitsuyoshi|"Mitsuyoshi Jubei Yagyu"}}
:{{animevoices|[[Aoi Yūki]]|[[Emily Neves]]}}
:The female protagonist of the series and Muneakira's first Master Samurai, with the contractual mark on her chest. According to Hattori, when she transforms she has a power level of five million. The transformation causes her eyes to turn amber with vertical slits, and in this state she is an honorable warrior who gives respect to those who have earned it but also appears to have a sadistic side. In her normal form, she has no memories of her former life and is obsessed with Muneakira whom she has referred to as "onii-chan" (big brother) from the very first moments of their meeting. She is airheaded, innocent, and acts very much like a child, which is reinforced by the fact that she refers to herself in third-person. Her weapon is a ''[[daishō]]'' set, with an  unusually colored katana. She does not need to chant a phrase in order to transform; she only transforms when she kisses Muneakira or when she experiences very strong feelings. Initially, during her transformations Muneakira would find himself bound by chains of unknown origin that were later revealed to be his powers as a General not yet being fully developed.

:It's revealed that Jubei's Master Samurai state is her true self; her current personality having been created by an incomplete contract. Jubei's inner self warns Jubei that kissing Muneakira once more will complete the contract at the cost of her innocent persona. In her final battle, Jubei sacrifices herself to defeat Gisen. However, after the credits of the DVD/Blu-ray release it is shown that she returns to once again share a kiss with Muneakira.

:During the second season, it's discovered that Jubei can no longer transform into a Master Samurai since the inner Jubei died as a result of her battle with Gisen. As she trains with Keiji, inner Jubei returns. Jubei is the only one of Muneakira's Master Samurai who completes the Samurai Bride contract, thus becoming a Samurai Bride.

;{{nihongo|[[Sanada Yukimura|Yukimura Sanada]]|真田 幸村|Sanada Yukimura}}
:{{animevoices|[[Rie Kugimiya]]|[[Hilary Haag]]}}
:A 15-year-old first year high school student with an underdeveloped body who is the leader of the Toyotomi faction. She is Muneakira's second Master Samurai, with the mark of wisdom on her left butt cheek. Her weapons are a pair of huge battle fans capable of manipulating wind and can also use them to block enemy attacks. Initially, she has almost no control over her powers when she is in her Master Samurai state, though she improves as the series progresses. She also seems to have feelings for Muneakira. In season one her transformation phrase is "''Fushaku Shinmyo''", which means "Self-sacrificing Dedication". During season two, she is able to transform into a Master Samurai at will. Jubei's nickname for Yukimura is {{nihongo|"Yukki"|ゆっきー|Yukkī}}.

;{{nihongo|[[Senhime|Sen Tokugawa]]|徳川 千|Tokugawa Sen}}
:{{animevoices|[[Minako Kotobuki]]|[[Luci Christian]]}}
:Muneakira's childhood friend and the eldest daughter of the Tokugawa Shogunate. She seems to have feelings for Muneakira, and acts very much like a [[tsundere]] towards him. She is a self-proclaimed spoiled princess and always seeks to get her way regarding any decision she wants to make. She gets extremely jealous of any girl who tries to get close to Muneakira, and generally acts upon this jealousy by flying into a rage. Later, she reveals her true feelings to Muneakira and kisses him, thus becoming his third Master Samurai. Her weapon is a [[naginata]] decorated near the blade, and her transformation phrase is "''Tenga Ryūrei''", which means "Elegant Beauty". In the second season she is able to transform into a Master Samurai at will with no phrase required. Sen's attacks usually involve thunder or lightning.

;{{nihongo|[[Sarutobi Sasuke|Sasuke]]|佐助}}
:{{animevoices|[[Chinatsu Akasaki]]|Adele Dazeem}}
:Yukimura's pet monkey. She is very fond of Jubei who can speak Monkey. She gains the ability to become human when she accidentally kisses Muneakira and becomes his Fourth Master Samurai. In human form she has long blonde hair and is partially covered in fur. She changes back into a monkey when she is tired. Despite her rivalry with Kanetsugu, she is shown to care deeply for Kanetsugu to the point of sacrificing herself to protect Kanetsugu.

;{{nihongo|[[Naoe Kanetsugu|Kanetsugu Naoe]]|直江 兼続|Naoe Kanetsugu}}
:{{animevoices|[[Aki Toyosaki]]|[[Rozie Curtis]]}}
:Kanetsugu is the self-proclaimed "Warrior of Love" and one of Yukimura's childhood friends. Yukimura humiliated her when they were both younger and Kanetsugu still carries a grudge because of it. Kanetsugu was sent by Sen's brother, Yoshihiko, to spy on Sen and Yukimura's actions. Her speech pattern is notable as she uses [[Honorific speech in Japanese|keigo]]. At one point in the series she feels that she is a liability to the dojo and decides to sneak away during the night, but ends up getting ambushed by Araki Mataemon. After he defeats her, Mataemon throws Kanetsugu into a street canal the moment Muneakira arrives looking for her. Rescuing an unconscious and critically wounded Kanetsugu, Muneakira proceeds to resuscitate her by performing [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] while crying at the thought of losing her should he fail. Muneakira's emotional state connects with Kanetsugu's dying state at a spiritual level, forming a new bond between the two of them which changes his next attempt at CPR into a contract kiss and turning Kanetsugu into Muneakira's Fifth Master Samurai. Her weapon is a decorated sledgehammer capable of knocking heavy gates and creating fissures when slammed down to the ground. Jubei's nicknames for Kanetsugu are {{nihongo|"Gutsugutsu"|ぐつぐつ|}}, {{nihongo|"Gucchan"|ぐっちゃん}}, and {{nihongo|"Gucchorinado"|ぐっちょりなど}}. Kanetsugu's appearance oddly resembles that of Vocaloid [[Hatsune Miku]]. Her favorite food is [[leek (vegetable)|leek]], also like Miku.

;{{nihongo|[[Gotō Mototsugu|Matabei Goto]]|後藤 又兵衛|Gotō Matabee}}
:{{animevoices|[[Yū Kobayashi]]|[[Shelley Calene-Black]]}}
:Yukimura's bodyguard and loyal samurai, she wears a fundoshi. Her favored weapon is a ''[[yari]]'' but she also uses a small ''[[tantō]]'' that she wears as a hair accessory. She seems to have a weakness for hot baths, as seen when she eagerly attempted to enter one as "punishment" from Hanzo. She possess a superhuman sense of smell. She later becomes Muneakira's sixth Master Samurai. In master samurai mode her weapon becomes a giant brush with a retractable spear head. Jubei's nickname for Matabei is {{nihongo|"Beta-san"|べーたさん}}.

;{{nihongo|[[Hattori Hanzō|Hanzo Hattori]]|服部 半蔵 美成|Hattori Hanzō Yoshinari|"Yoshinari Hanzo Hattori"}}
:{{animevoices|[[Saori Gotō]]|[[Maggie Flecknoe]]}}
:Sen's servant and head of the Student Council police who wears a maid's outfit and glasses. It is hinted that she has deeper feelings for Sen and is a [[Sadomasochism|masochist]], who longs for Sen's abuses. Her weapon is a double-bladed pole that can split into two individual katana, and she can shoot a number of [[shuriken]], [[kunai]] or any throwable material from under her skirt. Her glasses allow her to detect an individual's power level and also see through any man-made material. She later becomes Muneakira's seventh Master Samurai. In master samurai she uses a holographic display in lieu of her glasses to detect an opponents power level plus their [[Qi]] level. Her weapon is a giant scroll on her back that can split into various three-sided shurikans.

===Toyotomi faction===
The {{nihongo|'''[[Toyotomi Hideyoshi|Toyotomi]] Faction'''|豊臣方|Toyotomi-hō}} is a faction of the Academy dedicated to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate and bring a new era to Great Japan. Yukimura and Matabei are also members of this faction.

===Buou Student Council===
;{{nihongo|Yoshihiko Tokugawa|徳川 慶彦|Tokugawa Yoshihiko}}
:{{animevoices|[[Takahiro Sakurai]]|[[Leraldo Anzaldua]]}}
:Sen's older brother, president of the Student Council, and head of the Tokugawa Shogunate. He believes that he is doing the best for his country, when in reality he is a ruthless tyrant with a tendency to use and discard people, including his own sister. Yoshihiko had a brief relationship with Charles d'Artagnan until he used her in one of his experiments to create Master Samurai by artificial means. He has also used other girls (who were, in fact, descendants of former Master Samurai) in his experiments, planning to create an army of Master Samurai since there are so few of them in existence. Realizing his feelings for d'Artagnan after she sacrifices herself to save him, he revives her by making a Master Samurai contract with her, and later teams up with Muneakira to defeat Gisen.

:His other Master Samurai are able to use magic to create barriers but very little is known about them.

;{{nihongo|[[Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan|Charles d'Artagnan]]|シャルル・ド・ダルタニアン|Sharuru do Darutanian}}
:{{animevoices|[[Ami Koshimizu]]|[[Shannon Emerick]]}}
:Nicknamed {{nihongo|Nia|ニア}}, d'Artagnan is a tall blonde woman from France who transferred to Buou Academy. She met Yoshihiko while she was doing [[origami]], and developed a romantic relationship in him. However, she was betrayed when Yoshihiko used her as a test subject to create Master Samurai by artificial means. Despite that he has done to her, she still has feelings for Yoshihiko, as seen in the anime and novels when she dies protecting Yoshihiko from falling rubble while holding an origami samurai's helmet that Yoshihiko had given her in the past. She was later revived by Yoshihiko and becomes a true Master Samurai with the contractual mark on her left hand.

:d'Artagnan's powers as a Master Samurai allow her to channel different elements. However, because her Master Samurai powers were created artificially, her body suffers great strain from using her powers. Also, her aura differs from the other Master Samurai (sans Gisen), as it is violet as opposed to the standard black. She wields twin [[claymore]]s as weapons, utilizing them to create elemental-powered attacks.

===Hatamoto Student Council===
The {{nihongo|'''Hatamoto Student Council'''|旗本生徒会|Hatamoto Seitokai}} is a faction of Buou Academy's Student Council serving directly under Yoshihiko.

===Anti-Tokugawa faction===
The {{nihongo|'''Anti-Tokugawa Faction'''|反徳川|}} is a faction led by Shiro Amakusa. Their main purpose is to destroy the Tokugawa Shogunate by any means possible.

;{{nihongo|[[Amakusa Shirō|Shiro Amakusa]]|天草 四郎 時貞|Amakusa Shirō Tokisada|''Tokisada Shiro Amakusa''}}
;{{nihongo|Gisen Yagyu|柳生 義仙|Yagyū Gisen}}
:{{animevoices|[[Kaoru Mizuhara]]|[[Melissa Davis]] (Season 1), [[Jessica Boone]] (Season 2)}}
:The series' main antagonist. Gisen is a young girl sporting an eyepatch over her right eye who falls naked from the sky into Muneakira's arms, much like Jubei did. She is initially friendly and demure, but is shown to be very perverse when around Muneakira (whom she refers to as "Master"). She is continually trying to "tuck" a certain part of his body between her breasts; the reason being is that she thinks that the relationship between a general and a samurai is similar to that of a master and slave. Jubei nickname for Gisen is "Gittan", and Gisen refers to Jubei as "onee-sama" (big sister).

:It is later revealed that she is a Master Samurai, with the contractal mark on her right eye. Her general is [[Amakusa Shirō]], a powerful samurai who once aspired to destroy Japan until he was killed by a group of rebels. She intends to revive him to destroy Japan once more. Her true personality is also revealed throughout the story, revealing her as a highly sadistic person who will stop at nothing to ensure her general's revival; she even attempted to take Jubei's body into her own to further the process. Her transformation phrase is "''Inka Ryōran''", which means "Indecent Flower Blooming Profusely", and her attacks usually involve ice. Gisen's right eye (colored red) can control and manipulate people's minds, and she wields a blade that can turn into a scissor-like weapon.

;{{nihongo|[[Yui Shōsetsu|Shosetsu Yui]]|由比 正雪|Yui Shōsetsu}}

;{{nihongo|[[Miyamoto Musashi|Musashi Miyamoto]]|宮本 武蔵|Miyamoto Musashi}}
:{{animevoices|[[Yōko Hikasa]]|Molly Searcy}}
:A hotblooded but honorable warrior who likes to fight strong opponents which is her main motivation. She is particularly interested in fighting anyone who can wield two swords like herself. She has pink hair, wears a simple tan uniform with a pair of headphones around her neck, and also fights using a daishō set. Her headphones are used to counteract her artificial ears, which hear unnecessary things, while she is in a serious battle. She possesses artificial ears due to being resurrected improperly. She is the leader of the four Dark Samurai. She was given the nickname Mucchan by Jubei.

;{{nihongo|[[Sasaki Kojirō|Kojiro Sasaki]]|佐々木 小次郎|Sasaki Kojirō}}
:{{animevoices|[[Naomi Shindō]]|[[Cynthia Martinez]]}}
:One of the four Dark Samurai, she relies upon her intellect as often as her physical strength. Although she is drawn to fighting strong opponents, she doesn't favor a true state of war as she may not be able to tell her enemies from her allies. Physically, she has long purple hair with a fair white complexion to her skin. She wears a black [[kimono]] with a simple white floral design on her right shoulder, sleeve ends, and lower portion. Due to being resurrected improperly, her eyes won't recover completely so she is able to see all sorts of things. Using her power, which is often signified by a black piece of equipment placed over her eyes, she is able to filter out the unnecessary items from her sight.

;{{nihongo|[[Araki Mataemon|Mataemon Araki]]|荒木 又右衛門|Araki Mataemon}}
:{{animevoices|[[Haruka Tomatsu]]|Rozie Pucker}}
:A boyish girl with a foul mouth. She has orange hair tied back with a band and wears a unbuttoned shirt. Her arm bandages are revealed to be hiding artificial body parts due to a mistake during her revival. Due to this, she is less "human" than any of the other Dark Samurai and is able to be manipulated. She wields a giant cleaver in battle. She is one of the four Dark Samurai.

;{{nihongo|[[Hōzōin In'ei|Inshun Hozoin]]|宝蔵院 胤舜|Hōzōin Inshun}}
:{{animevoices|[[Satomi Satou]]|[[Margaret McDonald (voice actor)|Margaret McDonald]]}}
:A reserved loli type character with blue hair, fair skin who wears a black top over a white shirt, shorts, black boots and red gloves. She always has her circular shield worn on her back and wields a spear in battle. She often uses black [[crow]]s and can seemingly talk to them. The flaw she possesses from her imperfect resurrection is that she always wears a black machine on her throat which is actually what speaks for her. She herself has always been pretending to talk normally. She is one of the four Dark Samurai. Her nickname is Inko-chan which was given to her by Jubei.

===Other Characters===
;{{nihongo|[[Maeda Toshimasu|Keiji Maeda]]|前田 慶次|Maeda Keiji}}
:{{animevoices|[[Mamiko Noto]]|[[Monica Rial]]}}
:Keiji is a wandering samurai who despises men. She is a master of [[Qi]], a master of disguise, and also wields an umbrella in battle. As a childhood friend of Kanetsugu, Keiji has taken her appearance to initially teach the girls how to use [[Qi]]. Her hatred for men led her to refuse to teach Muneakira how to use Qi. Her method of choice for long-distance transport is by motorcycle. Her nickname "Maedake" was given to her by Jubei.

;{{nihongo|[[Uesugi Kagekatsu|Kagekatsu Uesugi]]|上杉 景勝|Uesugi Kagekatsu}}

At [[Anime Expo]] 2010, Hobby Japan announced they will release English translations of the novels in North America along with the ''[[Queen's Blade]]'' and ''[[Queen's Blade Rebellion]]'' game books in the near future in an effort to expand their business. They have stated they will release the series digitally through Apple's iBookstore and Amazon's Kindle store before releasing them in print, which will in turn include figurines of the characters.&lt;ref name="Hyakka_EnglishLN"/&gt; However, no light novels have been released following the announcement.

===Manga===
An anthology comic was serialized on Hobby Japan's online website Hobby Channel. The first chapter was serialized on June 1, 2010, with new chapters serialized on the 25th of each month.

==Notes==
{{reflist|group=Note|refs=
&lt;ref name=name1&gt;{{nihongo|"Hyakka Ryōran"|百花繚乱}} is a Japanese phrase meaning "Countless flowers blooming in profusion". In this case, though, it means "A gathering of many beautiful and talented women".&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=name2&gt;In the anime, [[katakana]] is used in place of the English subtitle for "Samurai Girls".&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''InterWorld''''' is a fantasy and science fiction novel by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Michael Reaves]]. The book was published in [[2007 in literature|2007]] by EOS, an imprint of [[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Publishers]]. It follows the story of Joey Harker who, together with a group of other Joeys from different Earths in other [[multiverse|parallel universes]], try to stop the two forces of magic and science from taking over all of the Earths in different universes.

==Plot summary==
Joey Harker is an average high school student living in Greenville. He had trouble finding his way around his own house, let alone the town. On a field trip set by his [[Social Studies]] teacher, Mr. Dimas, Joey found himself lost in the city. He then entered a strange fog and when he emerged, everything had changed. All the cars were brightly coloured and the police cars was flashing green and yellow instead of blue and red. He went back home and discovered that he does not exist anymore, instead a girl named Josephine lived there. He ran outside and met a man wearing a mirrored mask. The man introduced himself as  Jay. Before Jay could explain anything, three men appeared, standing on floating silver disks and wearing grey outfits appeared, all trying to catch Joey using silver nets. Joey runs, unintentionally entering the fog again.

Afraid of going back to a home where he doesn't exist, Joey decided to go to Mr. Dimas for help. When he met Mr. Dimas, Mr Dimas was shocked to see Joey, telling him that he had drowned last year and that Mr. Dimas himself had pulled Joey's body out of the river. Suddenly a woman appeared in the room, bewitching Joey into following her. She calls herself Lady Indigo and is joined by two other men. One, called Scarabus, had mystical tattoos all over his body. The other, a man with transparent skin, is called Neville. They moved Joey to a flying ship, the ''Lacrimae Mundi''.

The ship teleports to ''Nowhere-at-all'', a sort of [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]]. They were heading towards a place called "HEX Prime".Before they could reach there, Jay arrived and helped Joey escape, getting himself injured in the process. Joey then opened a portal to the ''In-Between'', a [[Dimension|multidimensional]] world, where only Walkers and MDLF (multidimensional life forms, or mudluffs) beings could enter. The ''in-between'' is a shortcut for traveling from world to world. Joey and Jay exited ''in-between'' and arrived at a desert. There Jay explained to Joey how he was a part of an organization called ''InterWorld'' and their job was to keep the [[Multiverse|altiverse]] balanced by stopping the scientific force (Binary) from making worlds too scientific, while also stopping the magical force (HEX) from making worlds too magical. Jay also said that Joey had the ability to "Walk", or go into the In-Between and other dimensions quickly and effectively.

After re-entering the "in-between", they met a mudluff which looked like a bubble and communicated using colours. It appeared to be trapped by something. Joey approaches it and as Joey tries to free the mudluff, a giant serpent (Revealed in the second book to be called a Gyradon) appears, biting Jay. The mudluff kills the serpent but Jay was already dying. Before he dies he gave Joey the direction to Base Town, where InterWorld HQ is. With his dying breath, he showed Joey a mathematical equation that would lead to Base Town: {IW}:=Ω/∞ (InterWorld is [[Omega]] over [[Infinity]]). The mudluff then becomes attached to Joey and he names it "[[Hue]]". Joey then went to HQ and learns that all Walkers were all copies of himself from different Earths. He began an intense course of exercise while studying very advanced science and magic to prepare him for his new role as a member of the InterWorld. Many of the other Joeys initially resented Joey for causing Jay's death, but soon come around about him as his skills improve.

After a few months, Joey and four other Walkers went on a training mission. They were supposed to retrieve some signal beacons in a more scientific earth. But the earth they went to turned out to be a "shadow realm" and is in fact a trap, set by the same people who captured him earlier from HEX. Everyone in the team was captured by HEX, except Joey who was saved by Hue. When Joey escaped back to HQ, the leader, an old man named Joe (a.k.a. Old Man), decided that Joey is not capable of working in InterWorld, and wiped Joey's mind of his life in InterWorld. Joey was then sent home, where he thought nothing had happened, but feels like something is missing. After some time, while blowing bubbles with his little brother, Joey remembers Hue, and every memory about the Altiverse comes back to him. With all those memories back, Joey said goodbye to his family, Walks into the Altiverse again, and set off to save his teammates.

With Jay's words in his head and Hue's help, Joey finds the airship where his teammates were being held, and lands safely on it. However, he was captured as well and taken to meet Lord Dogknife, a large hideous goblin who led the people who captured his teammates. Joey was then taken to the room where his teammates are being held. A large cauldron is in the center of the room, built to capture their souls to power the ship. The HEX boil down Walkers to their raw essence, which was used as power supplies for their transdimensional spacecraft.

Joey manages to move over to the cauldron and knocked it over, incinerating some of the guards in the room. He then moved over to untie his friends, who all try to find an exit. They found an exit and escaped to the engine room.

The engine room was filled with souls from other Walkers, powering the ship. Joey and his teammates broke the jars containing them to free the souls and shut the ship down. The engine explodes, and Joey and his teammates plan an escape from the Nowhere-At-All. They talk of a gate in the Nowhere-At-All from which they can escape, but it was closing quickly. Joey decides he would not leave without Hue, because it had saved his life multiple times.

Many soldiers then came into the destroyed engine room in an attempt to recapture Joey and his teammates, along with Scarabus. J/O, a [[cyborg]] Joey, offered a duel and defeated Scarabus, and everyone went to find Lord Dogknife.

Dogknife was in the room where Joey saw him earlier, captured by the souls and thus rendered harmless. Joey finds Hue and escapes with his teammates. They were about to escape when Lady Indigo appeared to face them. Joey distracts her from fighting them with some powder in his pocket, and he and his teammates escaped through the gate before returning to Interworld HQ.

They return to the Old Man, who did not congratulate them for their heroic work. Instead, he lectured them on all their wrongdoings in the Altiverse. However, he now said that Joey was allowed to stay without wiping his memory. The group soon set out on another mission.

==In other media==
The idea of ''InterWorld'' surged in 1996, when Reaves was developing an animated series for [[DreamWorks]]. Suggesting to Gaimain an idea for a possible animated television series, they collaborated on the story and unsuccessfully tried to sell it to various studios, including DreamWorks, which was not interested. The ''InterWorld'' idea ended up being a novel that was not released until 2007.&lt;ref name=NGNewsAndMusing /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neil Gaiman's Film Work |url=http://www.neilgaiman.com/Cool_Stuff/Essays/Essays_About_Neil/Neil_Gaiman's_Film_Work |publisher=Neil Gaiman |accessdate=November 2, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302121927/http://www.neilgaiman.com/Cool_Stuff/Essays/Essays_About_Neil/Neil_Gaiman%27s_Film_Work |archivedate=March 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 2007, [[Neil Gaiman]] reported in his journal that [[DreamWorks Animation]] optioned the book to make it into an animated feature film.&lt;ref name=NGNewsAndMusing&gt;{{cite news|last=Gaiman|first=Neil|url=http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2007/06/news-and-musing.html|title=News and musing|publisher=neilgaiman.com|date=June 16, 2007|accessdate=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonora Beck Ellis''' (née, '''Leonora Beck'''; 1862-1951) was a 19th-century American educator, author, poet, and Southern social reformer,{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=49}} from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. She served as president of the Woman’s Press Association of Georgia,{{sfn|Southern Historical Association|1895|p=690}} and for five years, was president of the Capital Female College of [[Atlanta]].{{sfn|American Publishers' Association|1915|p=95}}

==Early years and education==
Leonora Beck was born near [[Augusta, Georgia]], in 1862. Her father, Rev. James W. Beck (born [[Wilkes County, Georgia]], October 23, 1831), was among the first teachers at Jackson Institute. Her mother was Margaret Willis, of [[Meriwether County, Georgia]]. There were two brothers: Marcus W., judge of the Flint circuit court; and Walter L., business manager of the Griffin Wheel company, of Chicago.{{sfn|Southern Historical Association|1895|p=690}}

At an early age, she showed an unusual aptitude for linguistic study, speaking several modern languages when nine years old. She was well grounded in Latin and Greek when 15 years old. Ellis was educated at Oxford College, in [[Alabama]], the only college for men in the South which received women. There, she studied and trained for the teaching profession, graduating at the age of 16 years with A.M. distinction.{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=69}}

==Career== 
===Educator===
At once, Ellis accepted the position of young lady principal in the college at [[Bowdon, Georgia]], which she held for two and a half years. During her connection with that institution, Ellis instructed in [[metaphysics]], Latin and Greek about 100 students, ranging from the ages of 15 to 30 years. Her success as an educator becoming more generally known, she was urged to accept many positions of trust and honor, but declined them. Next, she taught at the Jackson Institute in [[Jackson, Georgia]]. In 1889, Ellis removed to [[Atlanta]] to engage in founding the Capital Female College, later known as the Leonora Beck College.{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=69}} 

===Writer and social reformer===
After her marriage to Richard Abbey Ellis, editor of the Atlanta ''Illustrator'',{{sfn|Bohemian Publishing Company|1896|p=60}} on June 2, 1896, she devoted herself to literature. Ellis' earliest articles appeared in ''Munsey's'', ''Leslie's'', the ''Bachelor of Arts'', and the ''New England Magazine'', in 1896 and 1897. Afterwards, she contributed stories, essays, travel sketches, and occasional verse to many different periodicals, but her chief writing was upon economic and sociological themes, and her thoughtful papers upon such subjects appeared from time to time in the ''Forum'', the ''Arena'', the ''Independent'', the ''Review of Reviews'', among others. Especially, she devoted herself to the varying phases of the great industrial revolution in the South, and her papers treating of social, educational, and material conditions in the manufacturing population of that section were accepted as high authority.{{sfn|Hills|Luce|1901|p=73}} Besides a volume of stories entitled 'Star Heights', and an occasional poem, a series of essays on [[Robert Browning]] was, perhaps, her most enduring contribution to literature.{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=69}}

Ellis was the author of a number of articles bearing upon economic and sociological conditions in the [[Southern United States|South]]. The [[Library of Congress]] listed her series of articles on child labor, because of the interest which they possess for students of this problem. Ellis spent much of her time in [[Aripeka, Florida]]. She was engaged in making investigations among the sponge fishers of the Florida coast.{{sfn|Alderman|Harris|Kent|1910|p=137}}

Many unproven [[conspiracy theories]] exist with varying degrees of popularity, frequently related to clandestine government plans and elaborate murder plots. Conspiracy theories usually deny consensus or cannot be proven using the [[Historical method|historical]] or [[scientific method]] and are not to be confused with research concerning verified conspiracies such as [[Gleiwitz incident|Germany's pretense for invading Poland in World War II]].

== Aviation ==
Numerous conspiracy theories pertain to air travel and aircraft. Incidents such as the 1955 bombing of the [[Kashmir Princess]], the 1985 [[Arrow Air Flight 1285]] crash, the [[1986 Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 crash]], the 1987 [[Helderberg Disaster]], the 1988 bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103 conspiracy theories|Pan Am Flight 103]] and the 1994 [[1994 Scotland RAF Chinook crash|Mull of Kintyre helicopter crash]] as well as various aircraft technologies and alleged sightings, have all spawned theories of foul play which deviate from official verdicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://listverse.com/2014/07/23/10-controversial-air-crash-conspiracy-theories/|work=Listverse|date=23 July 2014|title=10 Controversial Air Crash Conspiracy Theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black helicopters ===
This conspiracy theory emerged in the U.S. in the 1960s. The [[John Birch Society]], who asserted that a [[United Nations]] force would soon arrive in [[black helicopters]] to bring the U.S. under UN control, originally promoted it.&lt;ref name="The Financial Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/468c2fb4-8372-11de-a24e-00144feabdc0|work=The Financial Times|date=7 August 2009|title=Bring out the cranks and conspiracy theorists}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory re-emerged in the 1990s, under the presidency of [[Bill Clinton]], and has been promoted by talk show host [[Glenn Beck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/07/entertainment/la-et-glenn-beck-20110407|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=7 April 2011|title=Fox gives Glenn Beck's show the boot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theweek.com/articles/580740/ben-carson-ready-coming-american-apocalypse|work=The Week|date=2 October 2015|title=Ben Carson is ready for the coming American apocalypse}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar theory concerning so-called "phantom helicopters" appeared in the UK in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/historys-greatest-conspiracy-theories/black-or-unmarked-helicopters/|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2008|title=History's greatest conspiracy theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemtrails ===
[[File:Contrail.fourengined.arp.jpg|thumb|200px|A high-flying jet's engines leaving a condensation trail ([[contrail]])]]
Also known as SLAP (Secret Large-scale Atmospheric Program), this theory alleges that water condensation trails ("[[contrails]]") from aircraft [[Chemtrail conspiracy theory|consist of chemical or biological agents]], or contain a supposedly toxic mix of [[aluminum]], [[strontium]] and [[barium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My month with chemtrails conspiracy theorists|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/22/california-conspiracy-theorist-farmers-chemtrails|date=22 May 2017|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; under secret government policies.  An estimated 17% of people globally believe the theory to be true or partly true. In 2016, the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]] published the first-ever peer-reviewed study of the chemtrail theory; 76 out of 77 participating atmospheric chemists and geochemists stated that they had seen no evidence to support the chemtrail theory, or stated that chemtrail theorists rely on poor [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Quantifying expert consensus against the existence of a secret, large-scale atmospheric spraying program|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=11|issue=8|pages=084011|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/8/084011|date=10 August 2016|publisher=IOP Science|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/8/084011|last1=Shearer|first1=Christine|last2=West|first2=Mick|last3=Caldeira|first3=Ken|last4=Davis|first4=Steven J|bibcode=2016ERL....11h4011S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph"/&gt;

=== Korean Air Lines Flight 007 ===
The destruction of [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] by Soviet jets in 1983 has long drawn [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007 alternative theories|the interest of conspiracy theorists]]. The theories range from allegations of a planned espionage mission, to a US government cover-up, to the consumption of the passengers' remains by giant crabs.

=== Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 ===
The disappearance of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]] in southeast Asia in March 2014 has prompted many theories.  One theory suggests that this plane was hidden away and reintroduced as [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|Flight MH17]] later the same year in order to be shot down over Ukraine for political purposes.  Prolific American conspiracy theorist [[James H. Fetzer]] has placed responsibility for the disappearance with Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/22/mh17-five-bizarre-conspiracy-theories-zionist-plots-illuminati-russian-tv|work=The Guardian|date=22 July 2014|title=MH17: five of the most bizarre conspiracy theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Theories have also related to allegations that a [[Boeing Honeywell Uninterruptible Autopilot|certain autopilot]] technology was secretly fitted to the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/cia-withholding-information-on-flight-mh370-says-former-malaysian-pm-mahathir-mohamad-20140519-zrh0a.html|title=CIA withholding information on flight MH370, says former Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 ===
[[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] was shot down over Ukraine by Russia-backed rebels or by the Russian military in July 2014. This event has spawned numerous alternative theories. These variously include allegations that it was secretly [[Flight MH370]], that the plane was actually shot down by the [[Ukrainian Air Force]] to [[Frameup|frame]] Russia, that it was part of a conspiracy to conceal the "truth" about [[HIV]] (seven disease specialists were on board), or that the [[Illuminati]] or Israel was responsible.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sydney Morning Herald"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh17-was-shot-down-from-prorussian-rebel-controlled-territory-investigation-finds-20160928-grqter.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=29 September 2016|title=Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down from pro-Russian rebel controlled territory, investigation finds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business and industry ==
[[File:New Coke can.jpg|thumb|70px|[[New Coke]] was manufactured between 1985 and 2002]]

===''Deepwater Horizon''===
Multiple conspiracy theories pertain to [[Deepwater Horizon|a fatal oil-rig industrial accident]] in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico, alleging sabotage by those seeking to promote environmentalism, or a strike by North Korean or Russian submarines. Elements of such theories have been suggested or promoted by US radio host [[Rush Limbaugh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=David|title=Conspiracy Theories Behind BP Oil Spill in Gulf – From Dick Cheney To UFOs|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-43240454/conspiracy-theories-behind-bp-oil-spill-in-gulf----from-dick-cheney-to-ufos/|publisher=CBS News|date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The conspiracy theories behind the BP oil spill|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/13253/conspiracy-theories-behind-bp-oil-spill|work=The Week|date=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Coke ===
A theory claims that [[The Coca-Cola Company]] intentionally changed to an inferior formula with [[New Coke]], with the intent either of driving up demand for the original product or permitting the reintroduction of the original with a new formula using cheaper ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/newcoke.asp |title=New Coke Origins |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coca-Cola president [[Donald Keough]] rebutted this charge: "The truth is, we're not ''that'' dumb, and we're not that ''smart."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1048370-2,00.html | work=Time | first=John | last=Greenwald | title=Coca-Cola's Big Fizzle | date=12 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deaths and disappearances ==
Conspiracy theories frequently emerge following the deaths of prominent leaders and public figures. In ancient times, widespread conspiracy theories were circulated [[Nero Redivivus legend|pertaining to the death of the Roman emperor Nero]], who committed suicide in 68 AD.&lt;ref name="Blount"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blount|first=Brian K.|date=2009|title=Revelation: A Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ate5WYoD_jgC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=Nero+death+conspiracy+theory#v=onepage&amp;q=Nero%20death%20conspiracy%20theory|location=Louisville, Kentucky|publisher=Westminster Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22121-8|pages=248–249|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these theories claimed that Nero had actually faked his death and was secretly still alive, but in hiding, plotting to return and reestablish his reign.&lt;ref name="Blount"/&gt; In most of these stories, he was said to have fled to the East, where he was still loved and admired.&lt;ref name="Blount"/&gt; Other theories held that Nero really was dead, but that he would return from the dead to retake his throne.&lt;ref name="Blount"/&gt; Many [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] believed in these conspiracy theories and feared Nero's return because [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire#64-250|Nero had viciously persecuted them]].&lt;ref name="Blount"/&gt; The [[Book of Revelation]] alludes to the conspiracy theories surrounding Nero's alleged return in its description of the slaughtered head returned to life.&lt;ref name="Blount"/&gt;

[[File:JFK limousine.png|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] in the [[Presidential state car (United States)|presidential limousine]] shortly before his [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]]]]
Today, there are many [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/2017-bumper-conspiracy-theories-110509496.html|work=Yahoo News|date=11 October 2017|title=Is 2017 a Bumper Year for Conspiracy Theories?}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent Bugliosi]] estimates that over 1,000 books have been written about the Kennedy assassination,&lt;ref name="Bugliosi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bugliosi |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Bugliosi |title=Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F.

The disappearance, and often presumed death, of an individual may also become a cause for conspiracy theorists.

The [[New World Order (conspiracy)|New World Order theory]] states that a group of international elites controls governments, industry, and media organizations, with the goal of establishing global hegemony. They are alleged to be implicated in most of the major wars of the last two centuries, to carry out secretly staged events, and to deliberately manipulate economies.  Organizations alleged to be part of the plot include the [[Federal Reserve System]], the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[Trilateral Commission]], the [[Bilderberg Group]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/CHO402A.html The Criminalization of the State] Michel Chossudovsky 3 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Union]], the [[United Nations]], the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Bohemian Grove]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jane Kay |author2=Chronicle Environment Writer |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2009/07/06/MNUU18ICIV.DTL |title=San Francisco Bay Area |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=6 July 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Le Cercle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts |first=Andrew |title=The Green-Ink Brigade |url=http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/roberts_05_09.html |accessdate=15 June 2012 |newspaper=Literary Review |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824195542/http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/roberts_05_09.html |archivedate=24 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Yale University society [[Skull and Bones#Conspiracy theories|Skull and Bones]].

=== George Soros ===
Hungarian-American investor [[George Soros]] has been the subject of conspiracy theories since the 1990s. Soros has used his wealth to promote various political, social, educational and scientific causes, grants totaling an estimated $11 billion up to 2016.  However, theories tend to assert that Soros is in control of a large portion of the world's wealth and governments, and that he secretly funds a large range of persons and organizations for nefarious purposes, such as [[Antifa (United States)|Antifa]], which the conspiracies allege to be a single far-left militant group. Such ideas have been promoted by [[Donald Trump]],&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

=== Freemasonry ===
[[Masonic conspiracy theories|Conspiracy theories concerning the Freemasons]] have proliferated since the 18th century.

=== ''Üst akıl'' ===
[[Conspiracy theories in Turkey]] started to dominate public discourse during the late reign of the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] and [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].&lt;ref name=tinfoil /&gt; In 2014, Erdoğan coined the term ''üst akıl'' ("mastermind") to denote the alleged command and control institution, somewhat ambiguously placed with the government of the [[United States]], in a comprehensive conspiracy to weaken or even dismember Turkey, by orchestrating every political actor and action perceived hostile by Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/10/turkey-erdogan-middle-east-mastermind.html|title=The Middle East 'mastermind' who worries Erdogan|date=31 October 2014|publisher=[[Al-Monitor]]|author=Mustafa Akyol|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/03/turkey-zion-protocols-akp-version.html|title=Unraveling the AKP's 'Mastermind' conspiracy theory|date=19 March 2015|publisher=[[Al-Monitor]]|author=Mustafa Akyol|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tinfoil&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/12/the-tin-foil-hats-are-out-in-turkey/|title=The Tin-Foil Hats Are Out in Turkey|date=12 September 2016|publisher=[[Foreign Policy]]|author=Mustafa Akyol|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erdoğan as well as the [[Daily Sabah]] have on multiple occasions alleged that very different non-state actors—like the Salafi jihadist [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), the libertarian socialist [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) and supporters of [[Fethullah Gülen]]—were attacking Turkey at the same time in a well-coordinated campaign.&lt;ref name="globalconspiracy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/01/turkey-believes-all-terrorists-are-united-against-it.html|title=Why Turkish government pushes 'global conspiracy' narrative|date=9 January 2017|publisher=[[Al-Monitor]]|author=Mustafa Akyol|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One instance of promoting the "mastermind" conspiracy theory occurred in February 2017, when then-[[Ankara]] Mayor [[Melih Gökçek]] claimed that earthquakes in the western province of Çanakkale could have been organized by dark external powers aiming to destroy Turkey's economy with an "artificial earthquake" near Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/foreign-powers-performing-earthquake-tests-near-istanbul-to-destroy-economy-ankara-mayor.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=109436&amp;NewsCatID=341|title=Foreign powers performing 'earthquake tests' near Istanbul to destroy economy: Ankara mayor|date=7 February 2017|publisher=Hurriyet Daily News|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another example, in November 2017, the [[Islamism|Islamist]] newspaper ''[[Yeni Akit]]'' claimed that the fashion trend of "ripped denim" jeans was in fact a means of communication, via specific forms of rips and holes, between agents of foreign states and their collaborators in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/verschwoerungstheorie-in-der-tuerkei-geheimbotschaften-in-der-jeanshose/20637406.html|title=Geheimbotschaften in der Jeanshose|date=27 November 2017|publisher=tagesspiegel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israeli animal spying ===
Conspiracy theories exist alleging that [[Israel-related animal conspiracy theories|Israel uses animals]] to conduct espionage or to attack people.  These are often associated with conspiracy theories about [[Zionism]].

=== Malala Yousafzai ===
Conspiracy theories concerning [[Malala Yousafzai]] are widespread in [[Pakistan]], elements of which originate from a 2013 satirical piece in ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]''.  These theories variously allege that she is a Western spy, or that her attempted murder by the [[Taliban]] in 2012 was a secret operation to further discredit the Taliban, and was organized by her father and the CIA and carried out by actor [[Robert de Niro]] disguised as an [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] [[homeopath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/9655417/Pakistani-Islamist-politician-claims-Malala-was-not-injured.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 November 2012|title=Pakistani Islamist politician claims Malala was not injured}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d2f274b2-1de4-11e2-8e1d-00144feabdc0|work=Financial Times|date=24 October 2012|title=Pakistan thrives on conspiracy theory }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-29568637|publisher=BBC|date=10 October 2014|title=The antagonism towards Malala in Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity/malala-yousafzai-is-a-hero-to-many-but-has-few-fans-in-her-homeland-20170816-gxx8fo.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=18 August 2017|title=Malala Yousafzai is a hero to many, but has few fans in her homeland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conspiracy theories have arisen in this case because of alleged inconsistencies in the evidence presented by the British government. One example is [[Craig Murray]]'s blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2018/09/skripals-the-mystery-deepens/comment-page-1/#comments|title=Skripals - The Mystery Deepens - Craig Murray|author=|date=6 September 2018|website=craigmurray.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since at least the [[Middle Ages]], [[antisemitism]] has featured elements of conspiracy theory.  In medieval Europe it was widely believed that [[Jews]] poisoned wells, [[Jewish deicide|had been responsible for the death of Jesus]], and [[Blood libel|ritually consumed the blood of Christians]].  The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence of notions that Jews and/or [[Masonic conspiracy theories|Freemasons]] were plotting to establish control over the world. Forged evidence has been presented to spread the notion that [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jews were responsible for the propagation of Communism]], the most notorious example being ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' (1903).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/historys-greatest-conspiracy-theories/the-protocols-of-the-elders-of-zion/|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2008|title=History's greatest conspiracy theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such antisemitic conspiracy theories became central to the worldview of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Antisemitic theories persist today in notions concerning banking,&lt;ref name="Levy 2005 55"&gt;{{cite book|title = Antisemitism: a historical encyclopedia of prejudice|page=55|first=Richard|last=Levy|isbn=1-85109-439-3|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood, the news media and a purported [[Zionist Occupation Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Lee D.|title=Anthropology and the Racial Politics of Culture|year=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0822346982|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waltman|first=Michael|title=The Communication of Hate|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-1433104473|author2=John Haas |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/19/opinion/oe-stein19 |title=Who runs Hollywood?

[[Anti-Catholicism|Anti-Catholic]] [[paranoia]] has featured in the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] mind since the [[Reformation]].  Conspiracy theories have taken many forms, including the 17th-century [[Popish Plot]] allegations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Henrietta Heald |title= Chronicle of Britain: Incorporating a Chronicle of Ireland |publisher= Jacques Legrand |year= 1992 |page= 605 |isbn= 9781872031354 |ref= {{Harvid|Heald|1992}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims by persons such as [[William Blackstone]] that [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] posed a secret threat to Britain, and numerous writings by authors such as [[Samuel Morse#Political views|Samuel Morse]], [[Rebecca Reed]], [[Avro Manhattan]], [[Jack Chick]] and [[Alberto Rivera (activist)|Alberto Rivera]]. Theorists often claim that the [[pope]] is the [[Antichrist]], or they accuse Catholics of suppressing evidence incompatible with Church teachings and engaging in secret evil rituals, [[crime]]s and other plots.

=== Antichrist ===
Apocalyptic prophecies, particularly Christian claims about the [[End Times]], have inspired a range of conspiracy theories. Many of these cite the [[Antichrist]], a leader who will supposedly create an oppressive world empire. Countless figures have been called Antichrist, including [[Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II]], Russian emperor [[Peter the Great]], [[Saladin]], Pope [[John XXII]], [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Antichrist|title=Antichrist|work=''Encyclopaedia Brittanica|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/02/americans-obama-anti-christ-conspiracy-theories|title=One in four Americans think Obama may be the antichrist, survey says|work=The Guardian|date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/obama-the-antichrist-global-warming-a-myth-lizard-people-controlling-the-world-conspiracy-theory-8558384.html|title=Obama the antichrist?

=== Bible and Jesus ===
[[Bible conspiracy theory|Bible conspiracy theories]] posit that significant parts of the [[New Testament]] are false, or have been omitted. Various groups both real (such as the [[Holy See|Vatican]]) and fake (such as the [[Priory of Sion]]) are said to suppress relevant information concerning, for example, the dating of the [[Turin Shroud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/historys-greatest-conspiracy-theories/the-jesus-conspiracy/|work=''The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2008|title=History's greatest conspiracy theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this line of conspiracy theory has been stimulated by a debunked book titled ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' (1982), which claimed that [[Jesus]] and [[Mary Magdalene]] were lovers and that their offspring and descendants were secretly hidden in Europe following the death of Jesus, from whom the then-living French [[draughtsman]] [[Pierre Plantard]] claimed descent.  Interest in this hoax saw a resurgence following the publication of [[Dan Brown|Dan Brown's]] 2003 novel, ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David Aaronovitch]]|title=Voodoo Histories: How Conspiracy Theory Has Shaped the Modern World|origyear=2009|year=2010|publisher=Vintage|pages=187–218, Chapter 6: Holy Blood, Holy Grail, Holy Shit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
"[[War against Islam]]" is a conspiracy theory in [[Islamism|Islamist]] discourse which describes an alleged plot to either harm or annihilate the social system within [[Islam]]. The perpetrators of this conspiracy are alleged to be [[Kafir|non-Muslims]] and "[[Munafiq|false Muslims]]", allegedly in collusion with political actors in the Western world. The "War against Islam" theory is often used in order to refer to modern social problems and changes, but the [[Crusades]] are often seen as its starting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUcSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA559|title=The Oxford Handbook of Islam and Politics|date=September 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=John L.

Since the [[September 11 Attacks]], many [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]] conspiracy theories have emerged, concerning a variety of topics.

Among the foremost concerns of conspiracy theorists are questions of alien life; for example, allegations of government cover-ups of the supposed [[Roswell UFO incident]] or activity at [[Area 51]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US base leads poll's top conspiracy theories|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jul/31/1|date=31 July 2008|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also popular are theories concerning so-called '[[men in black]]', who allegedly silence witnesses.

[[Cattle mutilation|Many reports of dead cattle]] found with absent body parts and seemingly drained of blood have emerged worldwide since at least the 1960s.

== Government, politics and conflict ==
In the modern era, political conspiracy theories are often spread using [[fake news]] on social media. A 2017 study of fake news published by the [[Shorenstein Center]] found that "misinformation is currently predominantly a pathology of the right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shorensteincenter.org/combating-fake-news-agenda-for-research/|title=Combating Fake News: An Agenda for Research and Action - Shorenstein Center|date=2 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political conspiracy theories may take generalized and wide-ranging forms concerning wars and international bodies, but may also be seen at a localized level, such as the conspiracy theory pertaining to the 118th Battalion, a British regiment stationed in [[Kitchener, Ontario]] during [[World War I]], which is believed by some in Kitchener to still be present and controlling local politics.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Johnstone Burpee, "The Oxford Encyclopedia of Canadian History," Oxford University Press, 1926, pg 477.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illuminati ===
Conspiracy theories concerning the [[Illuminati]], a short-lived 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] society, appear to have originated in the late 19th century, when some conservatives in Europe came to believe that the group had been responsible for the [[French Revolution]] of 1789–1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Aaronovitch|title=Voodoo Histories: How Conspiracy Theory Has Shaped the Modern World|origyear=2009|year=2010|publisher=Vintage|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoaxes about the Illuminati were later spread in the 1960s by a group of American practical jokers known as the [[Discordianism|Discordians]], who, for example, wrote a series of fake letters about the Illuminati to ''[[Playboy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170809-the-accidental-invention-of-the-illuminati-conspiracy|title=The Accidental Invention of the Illuminati Conspiracy|publisher=BBC|date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[False flag]] operations are covert operations designed to appear as if they are being carried out by other entities. Some allegations of false flag operations have been verified or have been subjects of legitimate historical dispute (such as the 1933 [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag arson attack]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=UK |date=15 April 2001 |title=Historians Find 'Proof' that Nazis Burnt Reichstag |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1310995/Historians-find-proof-that-Nazis-burnt-Reichstag.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions of unsubstantiated allegations of such operations feature strongly in conspiracy theory discourse.

[[Global warming conspiracy]] theorists typically allege that the science behind [[global warming]] has been invented or distorted for ideological or financial reasons.&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/historys-greatest-conspiracy-theories/|work=''The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2008|title=History's greatest conspiracy theories}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many have promoted such theories, including US President [[Donald Trump]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After chilly forecast, Trump tweets U.S. 'could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/12/28/after-chilly-forecast-trump-tweets-u-s-could-use-a-little-bit-of-that-good-old-global-warming/|date=28 December 2017|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h/|title=Yes, Donald Trump did call climate change a Chinese hoax|date=3 June 2016|accessdate=2 December 2016|publisher=[[PolitiFact.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; US Senator [[James Inhofe]],&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/feb/11/fiddling-with-global-warming-conspiracies-while-rome-burns|title=Fiddling with global warming conspiracy theories while Rome burns|date=11 February 2011|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; British journalist [[Christopher Booker]],&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; and Viscount [[Christopher Monckton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2017/03/28/the-5-most-deranged-conspiracy-theories-from-gop-mega-donors-bizarro-climate-conference_partner/|title=The 5 most deranged conspiracy theories from GOP mega-donors' bizarro climate conference|date=29 March 2017|work=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weather and earthquake control projects ===
Numerous theories pertain to real or alleged weather-controlling projects.  Theories include the debunked assertion that [[High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program#Conspiracy theories|HAARP]], a radio-technology research program funded by the US government, is a secret weather-controlling system.  Some theorists have blamed 2005's [[Hurricane Katrina]] on HAARP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/illuminati-mind-control-hurricanes-conspiracy-theories-follow-haarp-1448711|work=International Business Times|date=30 July 2015|title=Illuminati, Mind Control and Hurricanes: Conspiracy Theories Follow HAARP}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HAARP has also been suggested to have somehow caused earthquakes, such as the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] or the [[2013 Saravan earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pappas|first1=Stephanie|title=Conspiracy Theories Abound as U.S. Military Closes HAARP|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/science/weird-science/conspiracy-theories-abound-u-s-military-closes-haarp-n112576|accessdate=29 November 2017|publisher=NBC News|date=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walia|first1=Arjun|title=Was Hugo Chavez Right About HAARP &amp; The Haiti Earthquake?

Also of interest to conspiracy theorists are [[cloud seeding|cloud-seeding technologies]].  These include a debunked allegation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/philip-eden/Lynmouth-Flood-man-made.htm|title=The day they made it rain|first=Philip |last=Eden|publisher=WeatherOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the British military's [[Project Cumulus]] caused the fatal 1952 [[Lynmouth Flood]] in Devon, England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/aug/30/sillyseason.physicalsciences|title=RAF rainmakers 'caused 1952 flood'|work=The Guardian|date=30 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims concerning a secret project said to have caused the [[2010 Pakistan floods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Aleem |last=Maqbool |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9110766.stm |title=Is Pakistan in denial about tackling its problems? |publisher=BBC News |date=21 October 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MKUltra ===
[[MKUltra|Genuine American research in the 1950s and 1960s]] into chemical interrogation and mind-control techniques has prompted many subsequent conspiracy theories, especially following CIA Director Richard Helm's 1973 order to destroy all files related to the project.  These theories include the allegation that the mass fatality at [[Jonestown]] in 1978 was connected to an MKUltra experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/historys-greatest-conspiracy-theories/project-mk-ultra/|work=''The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2008|title=History's greatest conspiracy theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RFID chips ===
[[RFID|Radio frequency identification chips]] (RFID), such as are implanted into pets as a means of tracking, have drawn the interest of conspiracy theorists who posit that this technology is secretly in widespread use on humans.  Former [[Whitby]] town councilor Simon Parkes has promoted this theory, which may be related to conspiracy theories concerning vaccination, electronic banking and the Antichrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/703856/MARK-OF-THE-BEAST-Secret-plan-to-implant-us-all-with-ID-chips-by-2017|title=MARK OF THE BEAST: Secret plan to 'implant us all with ID chips by 2017'|work=Daily Express|date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/559949/Vladimir-Putin-Simon-Parkes-alien-Ukraine-Russia-Labour-councillor|title='Vladimir Putin is advised by ALIENS' Councillor blames space reptiles for Ukraine crisis|work=Daily Express|date=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flat Earth ===
[[File:Flat Earth Society Logo.png|thumb|120px|Logo of the Flat Earth Society, 2013]]
[[Flat earth|Flat Earth theory]] first emerged in 19th-century England, despite the Earth's spherical nature having been known since at least the time of [[Pythagoras]]. It has in recent years been promoted by American software consultant Mark Sargent through the use of [[YouTube]] videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why bad ideas refuse to die|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/28/why-bad-ideas-refuse-die|date=28 June 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat-earther conspiracy theorists hold that planet Earth is not a sphere, and that evidence has been faked or suppressed to hide the fact that is instead a disc, or a single infinite [[plane (geometry)|plane]]. The conspiracy often implicates NASA.  Other claims may include such allegations as that [[GPS]] devices are rigged to make aircraft pilots wrongly believe they are flying around a globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Do they really think the earth is flat?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7540427.stm|date=4 August 2008|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flat Earth Society Says Evidence Of Round Planet Part Of Vast Conspiracy Theory|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/29/flat-earth-society-psychology_n_2038198.html|date=29 October 2012|work=HuffPost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology suppression ===
Numerous theories pertain to the alleged suppression of certain technologies and energies.  Such theories may focus on the [[Vril|Vril Society Conspiracy]], allegations of the suppression of the [[electric car]] by fossil-fuel companies (as detailed in the 2006 documentary ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]''), and the [[Phoebus cartel]], set up in 1924, which has been accused of suppressing longer-lasting light bulbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaughen|first1=Patrick|title=Structural Inefficiency in the Early Twentieth Century: Studies in the Aluminum and Incadescent Lamp Markets|url=http://www.andover.edu/aep/papers/610/pgaughen98.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050224031701/http://www.andover.edu/aep/papers/610/pgaughen98.pdf|archivedate=24 February 2005|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other long-standing allegations include the suppression of [[perpetual motion]] and [[cold fusion]] technology by government agencies, special interest groups, or fraudulent inventors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite book |last=Tutt |first=Keith |title=The Scientist, The Madman, The Thief and Their Lightbulb: The Search for Free Energy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMwSmB6_94QC |accessdate=23 March 2013 |year=2003 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster UK |location=UK |isbn=978-0684020907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoters of alternative energy theories have included Thomas Henry Moray,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=B. King |first=Moray |title=The Energy Machine of T.

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugene Mallove]], and convicted American fraudster [[Stanley Meyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tony|last=Edwards|title= End of road for car that ran on Water|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=1 December 1996|url=http://groups.google.com/group/sci.energy.hydrogen/msg/8ee0acb80e943e21?hl=endc310437cd1cee1e7&amp;
|via=Google Groups|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weaponry ===
Conspiracy theorists often attend to new military technologies, both real and imagined.  Subjects of theories include: the alleged [[Philadelphia Experiment]], a supposed attempt to turn a U.S. Navy warship invisible;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vallée |first1=Jacques F |year=1994 |title=Anatomy of a Hoax: The Philadelphia Experiment Fifty Years Later |url=http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_08_1_vallee.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Journal of Scientific Exploration |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=47–71 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222023540/http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_08_1_vallee.pdf |archivedate=22 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the alleged [[Montauk Project]], a supposed government program to learn about mind control and time travel; and the so-called [[Tsunami bomb]] which is alleged to have caused the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/howaboutthat/3477148/The-greatest-conspiracy-theories-in-history.html?image=5|title = History's greatest conspiracy theories|website = The Telegraph|accessdate = 29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories include Peter Vogel's debunked claim that an [[Port Chicago disaster#Debunked nuclear bomb theory|accidental explosion of conventional munitions at Port Chicago]] was in fact a nuclear detonation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Allen|first1=Robert|last2=Vogel|first2=Peter|title=America's Dark Secret: The Port Chicago Disaster|magazine=Nexus Magazine|date=June–July 1996|volume=3|issue=4|url=http://cruinthe.tripod.com/nexus/articles/portchicago.html|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a theory promoted by the Venezuelan state-run TV station [[ViVe]] that the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] was caused by a secret US "earthquake weapon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,583588,00.html |title=Hugo Chavez Says U.S. Hit Haiti With 'Earthquake Weapon'|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=7 April 2010|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== False history ===
[[File:Silvester II.JPG|thumb|100px|[[Pope Sylvester II]] (from 999 to 1003)]]
Some theories claim that the dates of historical events have been deliberately distorted. These include the [[phantom time hypothesis]] of German conspiracy theorist Heribert Illig, who in 1991 published an allegation that 297 years had been added to the calendar by establishment figures such as [[Pope Sylvester II]] in order to position themselves at the [[Millennialism|millennium]].

A comparable theory, known as the [[New Chronology (Fomenko)|New Chronology]], is most closely associated with Russian theorist [[Anatoly Fomenko]].  Fomenko holds that history is many centuries shorter than is widely believed and that numerous historical documents have been fabricated, and legitimate documents destroyed, for political ends.  Adherents of such ideas have included chess grandmaster [[Garry Kasparov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1316610/King-Arthur-was-really-a-Russian-say-Slavs.html|title=King Arthur was really a Russian, say Slavs|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Space agencies ==
Scientific space programs are of particular interest to conspiracy theorists. The most prolific theories allege that [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|the US moon landings were staged by NASA in a film studio]], with some alleging the involvement of director [[Stanley Kubrick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/02/pop-culture-myths-friends-melania-nicki-minaj|title=Stunts! Bumps!

A more recent theory, emergent following the activities of [[computer hacker|hacker]] [[Gary McKinnon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19946902|title=Profile: Gary McKinnon|date=14 December 2012|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that a secret program of manned space fleets known as Solar Warden exists, supposedly acting under the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/hilarywardle/in-space-only-italian-radio-operators-can-hear-you-scream|title=16 Batshit Space Conspiracy Theories That Will Freak You The Fuck Out |date=1 March 2017|publisher=Buzzfeed News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nibiru (Planet X) ===
Conspiracy theorists have long posited a plot by organizations such as NASA to conceal the existence of a large planet in the [[Solar System]] known as [[Nibiru cataclysm|Nibiru]] or Planet X, which allegedly, will one day pass close enough to the Earth to destroy it.  Predictions for the date of destruction have included 2003, 2012 and 2017. The theory began to develop following the publication of ''The 12th Planet'' (1976), by discredited Russian-American author [[Zecharia Sitchin]], was given its full form by [[Nancy Lieder]], and has since been promoted by American conspiracy theorist and [[End Times]] theorist [[David Meade (author)|David Meade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The man whose biblical doomsday claim has some nervously eyeing Sept. 23|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/09/20/the-christian-numerologist-whose-biblical-doomsday-claim-has-some-nervously-eyeing-sept-23/|date=20 September 2017|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The notion has remained popular, and received renewed attention during the period prior to the [[solar eclipse of 21 August 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will 2017 solar eclipse cause secret planet 'Nibiru' to destroy Earth next month?

== Sports ==
=== Boxing ===
[[Boxing]] has featured in conspiracy theories, such as the claims that the second [[Muhammad Ali|Ali]]-[[Sonny Liston|Liston]] fight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1622877-10-sports-conspiracy-theories-that-are-totally-true/page/2|title=10 Sports Conspiracy Theories That Are Totally True|author=Dan Carson|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first [[Timothy Bradley|Bradley]]-[[Manny Pacquiao|Pacquiao]] fight were fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1622877-10-sports-conspiracy-theories-that-are-totally-true/page/10|title=10 Sports Conspiracy Theories That Are Totally True|author=Dan Carson|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shergar ===
The notorious theft and disappearance of the Irish-bred racehorse [[Shergar]] in 1983 has prompted many conspiracy theorists to speculate about involvement by the [[Mafia]], the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and [[Colonel Gaddafi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/historys-greatest-conspiracy-theories/the-disappearance-of-shergar/|work=''The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2008|title=History's greatest conspiracy theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rigged selections processes ===
The "frozen envelope theory" suggests that the [[National Basketball Association]] rigged its 1985 draft Lottery so that [[Patrick Ewing]] would join the [[New York Knicks]]. Theorists claim that a lottery envelope was chilled so that it could be identified by touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rEJp00sYu7AC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=frozen+envelope+theory |title=Books.google.com |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 1 June 2008|accessdate=3 August 2010|isbn=978-1-55652-707-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar "hot balls theory", promoted by Scottish football manager [[David Moyes]], suggests that certain balls used in draws for [[UEFA]] competitions have been warmed to achieve specific outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11671/7590220/moyes-uefa-hot-balls-cost-us|title=Moyes – UEFA hot balls cost us|work=SkySports|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1984 Pepsi 400 ===
The 1984 Pepsi 400 at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]], Florida, was the first [[NASCAR]] race to be attended by a sitting US President, [[Ronald Reagan]], and was driver [[Richard Petty|Richard Petty's]] 200th victory.  Rival driver [[Cale Yarborough|Cale Yarborough's]] premature retirement to the [[pit stop|pit road]] has prompted conspiracy theorists to allege that organizers fixed the race in order to receive good publicity for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/13-most-stunning-sports-conspiracy-140957968.html|title=The 13 most stunning sports conspiracy theories, ranked|work=Yahoo Sporting News|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ronaldo and the 1998 World Cup Final ===
On the day of the [[1998 World Cup Final]], Brazilian striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] suffered a [[Epileptic seizure|convulsive fit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The great World Cup Final mystery|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1749000/1749324.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2 April 2002 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronaldo was initially removed from the starting lineup 72 minutes before the match, with the teamsheet released to a stunned world media, before he was reinstated by the Brazil coach shortly before kick off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Cup moments: Mystery surrounds Ronaldo in 1998 |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/international/world-cup-moments-mystery-surrounds-ronaldo-in-1998-1.3494639 |accessdate=4 September 2018 |work=Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="France"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/08/world-cup-stunning-moments-25-ronaldo-france "World Cup: 25 stunning moments [...] No15: Ronaldo falters as France win"]. ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 10 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Ronaldo "sleepwalked" through the final, with France winning the game.&lt;ref name="France"/&gt; The nature of the incident set off a trail of questions and allegations which persisted for years, with Alex Bellos writing in ''The Guardian'', "When Ronaldo's health scare was revealed after the match, the situation's unique circumstances lent itself to fabulous conspiracy theories. Here was the world's most famous sportsman, about to take part in the most important match of his career, when he suddenly, inexplicably, fell ill. Was it stress, epilepsy, or had he been drugged?".&lt;ref name="Paris"&gt;{{cite news |title=The mystery of Paris that refuses to go away |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jun/29/worldcupfootball2002.sport3 |accessdate=1 October 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions also circulated into who made Ronaldo play the game. The Brazil coach insisted he had the final say, but much speculation focused on sportswear company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], Brazil's multimillion-dollar sponsor—whom many Brazilians thought had too much control—putting pressure on the striker to play against medical advice.&lt;ref name="Paris"/&gt;

=== New England Patriots ===
{{see also|New England Patriots#Controversies}}
[[File:NRG Stadium before Super Bowl LI.jpg|thumb|[[NRG Stadium]] before [[Super Bowl LI]]]]
The [[New England Patriots]] have also been involved in numerous conspiracy theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike Freeman's 10-Point Stance: Pats Conspiracy Theories Are the NFL's UFOs|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2755593-mike-freemans-10-point-stance-pats-conspiracy-theories-are-the-nfls-ufos|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship]] [[2017–18 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship Game: New England Patriots 24, Jacksonville Jaguars 20|24–20 victory]] over the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], several conspiracy theories spread stating that the referees helped the Patriots advance to [[Super Bowl LII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Patriots had a few calls go their way vs. the Jaguars, and everyone is in conspiracy mode again|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2018/1/22/16917848/jaguars-patriots-refs-afc-championship-nfl-playoffs-2018|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, sports analyst [[Stephen A.

This is a '''list of writing systems''' (or '''scripts'''), classified according to some common distinguishing features. There are at least 3,866 languages that make use of an established writing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/enterprise-faq/how-many-languages-world-are-unwritten-0|title=How many languages in the world are unwritten?|date=9 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual name of the script is given first; the name of the language(s) in which the script is written follows (in brackets), particularly in the case where the language name differs from the script name. Other informative or qualifying annotations for the script may also be provided.

==Pictographic/ideographic writing systems==
{{Writing systems sidebar}}
Ideographic scripts (in which graphemes are [[ideogram]]s representing concepts or ideas, rather than a specific word in a language), and pictographic scripts (in which the graphemes are iconic pictures) are not thought to be able to express all that can be communicated by language, as argued by the linguists [[John DeFrancis]] and [[J. Marshall Unger]].  Essentially, they postulate that no ''full'' writing system can be completely pictographic or ideographic; it must be able to refer directly to a language in order to have the full expressive capacity of a language.  Unger disputes claims made on behalf of [[Blissymbols]] in his 2004 book ''Ideogram''.

Although a few [[pictographic script|pictographic]] or [[ideographic script]]s exist today, there is no single way to read them, because there is no one-to-one correspondence between symbol and language.  Hieroglyphs were commonly thought to be ideographic before they were translated, and to this day Chinese is often erroneously said to be ideographic.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K., ''Spoken and written language,'' Deakin University Press, 1985, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases of ideographic scripts, only the author of a text can read it with any certainty, and it may be said that they are ''interpreted'' rather than read.  Such scripts often work best as mnemonic aids for oral texts, or as outlines that will be fleshed out in speech.

*[[Mixtec writing|Mixtec]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Mixtecan languages|Mixtec]]
*[[Dongba script|Dongba]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Naxi language|Naxi]]{{spaced ndash}} Although this is often supplemented with syllabic [[Geba script]].
*[[Ersu Shaba script|Ersu ''Shābā'']] – [[Ersu language|Ersu]]
*[[Míkmaq hieroglyphic writing]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Míkmaq]]{{spaced ndash}} Does have phonetic components, however.
*[[Nsibidi]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Ekoid languages|Ekoi]], [[Efik language|Efik/Ibibio]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]]
*[[Testerian]] – used for missionary work in Mexico
*Other [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] with the exception of [[Maya script|Maya Hieroglyphs]].

There are also symbol systems used to represent things other than language, or to represent constructed languages. Some of these are
*[[Blissymbols]] – A constructed ideographic script used primarily in [[Augmentative and Alternative Communication]] (AAC).
*[[iConji]] – A constructed ideographic script used primarily in social networking
*[[Emoji]] - Used to communicate feelings and thoughts on the [[world wide web]]
*[[Isotype (picture language)]]
*[[Sona language (artificial)|Sona]]
* A wide variety of [[Writing system|notation]]s

[[Linear B]] and [[Asemic writing]] also incorporate ideograms.

== Logographic writing systems ==
In logographic writing systems, glyphs represent [[Word (linguistics)|word]]s or [[morpheme]]s (meaningful components of words, as in ''mean-ing-ful''), rather than phonetic elements.

Note that no logographic script is composed solely of [[logogram]]s. All contain graphemes that represent [[phonetic]] (sound-based) elements as well. These phonetic elements may be used on their own (to represent, for example, grammatical inflections or foreign words), or may serve as [[phonetic complement]]s to a logogram (used to specify the sound of a logogram that might otherwise represent more than one word). In the case of Chinese, the phonetic element is built into the logogram itself; in Egyptian and Mayan, many glyphs are purely phonetic, whereas others function as either logograms or phonetic elements, depending on context. For this reason, many such scripts may be more properly referred to as logosyllabic or complex scripts; the terminology used is largely a product of custom in the field, and is to an extent arbitrary.

===Consonant-based logographies===

*[[Sui language#Script|Shui script]] – [[Shui language]]

== Syllabaries ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Syllabary]] --&gt;
In a [[syllabary]], graphemes represent [[syllable]]s or [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]s. (Note that the 19th-century term ''syllabics'' usually referred to ''[[abugida]]s'' rather than true syllabaries.)

===[[Semi-syllabaries]]: Partly syllabic, partly alphabetic scripts===
In most of these systems, some consonant-vowel combinations are written as syllables, but others are written as consonant plus vowel. In the case of Old Persian, all vowels were written regardless, so it was ''effectively'' a true alphabet despite its syllabic component. In Japanese a similar system plays a minor role in foreign borrowings; for example, [tu] is written [to]+[u], and [ti] as [te]+[i]. Paleohispanic [[semi-syllabaries]] behaved as a [[syllabary]] for the [[stop consonant]]s and as an [[alphabet]] for the rest of consonants and vowels. The Tartessian or Southwestern script is typologically intermediate between a pure alphabet and the Paleohispanic full semi-syllabaries. Although the letter used to write a stop consonant was determined by the following vowel, as in a full [[semi-syllabary]], the following vowel was also written, as in an alphabet. Some scholars treat Tartessian as a redundant semi-syllabary, others treat it as a redundant alphabet. Zhuyin is semi-syllabic in a different sense: it transcribes half syllables. That is, it has letters for [[syllable onset]]s and [[syllable rime|rimes]] ''(kan = "k-an")'' rather than for consonants and vowels ''(kan = "k-a-n").''

== Segmental scripts ==
A [[segmental script]] has [[grapheme]]s which represent the [[phoneme]]s (basic unit of sound) of a language.

Note that there need not be (and rarely is) a one-to-one correspondence between the graphemes of the script and the phonemes of a language. A phoneme may be represented only by some combination or string of graphemes, the same phoneme may be represented by more than one distinct grapheme, the same grapheme may stand for more than one phoneme, or some combination of all of the above.

Segmental scripts may be further divided according to the types of phonemes they typically record:

=== Abjads ===
An [[abjad]] is a segmental script containing symbols for [[consonant]]s only, or where vowels are ''optionally'' written with [[diacritics]] ("pointing") or only written word-initially.

=== True alphabets ===
A true [[alphabet]] contains separate letters (not [[diacritic]] marks) for both [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s.

====Linear nonfeatural alphabets====
[[File:Alphabets in Europe.svg|thumb|right|300px|Writing systems used in countries of Europe.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This maps shows languages official in the respective countries; if a country has an independent breakaway republic, both languages are shown. Moldova's sole official language is Romanian (Latin-based), but the unrecognized de facto independent republic of Transnistria uses three Cyrillic-based languages: Ukrainian, Russian, and Moldovan. Georgia's official languages are Georgian and Abkhazian (in Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia), the sparsely recognized de facto independent republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia use Cyrillic-based languages: Both republics use Russian. Additionally, Abkhazia also uses Abkhaz, and South Ossetia uses Ossetian. Azerbaijan's sole official language is Azerbaijani, but the unrecognized de facto independent republic of Nagorno-Karabakh uses Armenian as its sole language. Additionally, Serbia's sole official language is Cyrillic Serbian, but within the country, Latin script for Serbian is also widely used.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alphasyllabary ===

An [[abugida]], or ''alphasyllabary'', is a segmental script in which [[vowel]] sounds are denoted by [[diacritical mark]]s or other systematic modification of the [[consonant]]s. Generally, however, if a single letter is understood to have an inherent unwritten vowel, and only vowels other than this are written, then the system is classified as an alphasyllabary regardless of whether the vowels look like diacritics or full letters. The vast majority of alphasyllabaries are found from India to Southeast Asia and belong historically to the Brāhmī family. The term abugida is derived from the first characters of the abugida in [[Ge'ez script|Ge'ez]]: አ (A) ቡ (bu) ጊ (gi) ዳ (da) — (compare with ''[[Alphabet#Etymology|alphabet]]''). Unlike abjads, the diacritical marks and systemic modifications of the consonants are not optional.

====Final consonant-diacritic abugidas====
In at least one abugida, not only the vowel but any [[syllable coda|syllable-final]] consonant is written with a diacritic. For example, representing [o] with an under-ring, and final [k] with an over-cross, [sok] would be written as {{IPA|s̥̽}}.

*[[Róng]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]]

====Vowel-based abugidas====
In a few abugidas, the vowels are basic, and the consonants secondary. If no consonant is written in Pahawh Hmong, it is understood to be /k/; consonants are written after the vowel they precede in speech. In Japanese Braille, the vowels but not the consonants have independent status, and it is the vowels which are modified when the consonant is ''y'' or ''w''.

Several of these systems, such as [[Isthmian script|Epi-Olmec]] and [[Indus script|Indus]], are claimed to have been deciphered, but these claims have not been confirmed by independent researchers. In many cases it is doubtful that they are actually writing. The [[Vinča symbols]] appear to be [[proto-writing]], and [[quipu]] may have recorded only numerical information. There are doubts that [[Indus script|Indus]] is writing, and the [[Phaistos Disc]] has so little content or context that its nature is undetermined.

'''Malak-Malak''' (also spelt Mullukmulluk, Malagmalag, Malak-Malak) or referred to as ''Ngolak-Wonga, Nguluwongga'' is an [[Australian Aboriginal language]] spoken by the [[Mulluk-Mulluk]] people. MalakMalak is nearly [[language death|extinct]], with children growing up speaking [[Australian Kriol language|Kriol]] or English instead. The language is spoken in the [[Daly River, Northern Territory|Daly River]] area around Woolianna and [[Nauiyu Nambiyu Community|Nauiyu]].

==Classification==
MalakMalak has sometimes been classified in a [[Daly languages|Northern Daly]] family along with an "Anson Bay" group of [[Wagaydyic languages|Wagaydy]] (Patjtjamalh, Wadjiginy, Kandjerramalh) and the unattested [[Giyug language|Giyug]].  Green concluded that Wagaydy and MalakMalak were two separate families.&lt;ref name="Green 2003"&gt;Green, I. "The Genetic Status of Murrinh-patha" in Evans, N., ed. "The Non-Pama-Nyungan Languages of Northern Australia: comparative studies of the continent’s most linguistically complex region". ''Studies in Language Change'', 552. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Later researchers have linked them, and this is reflected in Bowern (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Bowern, Claire. 2011. "[http://anggarrgoon.wordpress.com/2011/12/23/how-many-languages-were-spoken-in-australia/ How Many Languages Were Spoken in Australia?]", ''Anggarrgoon: Australian languages on the web'', December 23, 2011 ([http://pamanyungan.sites.yale.edu/master-list-australian-languages-v12 corrected] February 6, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Wagaydy people are recent arrivals in the area, and their language may only similar due to borrowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{AIATSIS|N31|Patjtjamalh}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[AIATSIS]]'' and ''[[Glottolog]]'' treats Wagaydy as an isolate and Giyug as unclassifiable.

== Typological classification ==
MalakMalak, is an [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative-absolutive language]] with constituent order mainly determined by [[information structure]] and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], but syntactically free. Marking of core-cases is optional. The language is mostly [[Dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]] (1), but also has no marking (2) and [[Head-marking language|head-marking]] features (2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wurin.lis.soas.ac.uk/Collection/MPI1001522|title=Collection Items:|website=wurin.lis.soas.ac.uk|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morphosyntactic properties ==
MalakMalak's verb phrase uses [[complex predicate]]s. These consist of an [[Inflection|inflecting]] verb that has properties of person, number and [[Tense–aspect–mood|tense]]. MalakMalak only has six such verbs. In example (4), ''yuyu'' and ''vida'' are inflecting verbs. Additionally, there are [[coverb]]s which have [[Grammatical aspect|aspectual]] properties, but do not inflect for number, tense or person. They occur with inflecting verbs. They are unlimited in number and new verbs are also borrowed into this class. In (4), ''kubuk-karrarr, dat-tyed,'' and ''ka'' are coverbs. They can also form [[Serial verb construction|serial verbs]] (''kubuk-karrarr, dat-tyed'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/19436013/Complex_Predicates_and_Serialization_in_the_Daly_River_Languages_and_beyond_|title=Dorothea Hoffmann: "Complex Predicates and Serialization in the Daly River Languages (and beyond?)"|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spatial Language ==
MalakMalak employs all three "classic" types of spatial [[Linguistic_frame_of_reference|Frames of Reference]]: intrinsic, relative and absolute. Additionally, the language uses place names and body-part orientation to talk about space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/3796568/Mapping_Worlds_Frames_of_Reference_in_MalakMalak|title=Dorothea Hoffmann. (MUR). "Mapping Worlds: Frames of Reference in MalakMalak". In Proceedings to the 39th Meeting of the Berkeley Linguistic Society 2013. University of California: Berkeley|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/24303018/Usage_Patterns_of_Spatial_Frames_of_Reference_and_Orientation_Evidence_from_three_Australian_languages|title=Dorothea Hoffmann. (in prep). "Usage Patterns of Spatial Frames of Reference and Orientation: Evidence from three Australian languages"|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intrinsic Frame requires some kind of portioning of the ground object or landmark into named facets from which search domains can be projected.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Grammars of Space: Explorations in cognitive diversity|last=Levinson|first=Stephen|last2=Wilkins, David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English this would be, for example, ''the tree is in front of the man.'' And in MalakMalak it would be (5).

(5) intrinsic Frame of Reference
{| class="wikitable"
!tjung
!angundu-na
!muyu
|-
|tree
|behind-LOC
|3SG.N*.stand.PST
|}
"the tree was behind (the man)"

The relative Frame of Reference involves mapping from the observer's own axes (''front, back, left, right'') onto the ground object.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An English example is ''the ball is on the right.'' In MalakMalak it would be (6)

(6) relative Frame of Reference
{| class="wikitable"

!purrat-ma
!wuta
|-
|now
|right
|place
|up/upwards
|jump-CONT
|3SG.N.go.PST
|}
"now the ball was on the right, jumping up (lit. jumping in an upward place on the right)"

The absolute Frame of Reference requires xed bearings that are instantly available to all members of the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An English example is ''the opera is west of here.'' In MalakMalak, three different types of absolute frames can be used. Those based on the course of the sun (''east/west'') (7a), on prevailing winds (''northwesterly/southeasterly'') (7b), and on two sides of the prominent [[Daly River, Northern Territory|Daly River]] (''northeastern/southwestern bank'') (7c).

[[Image:Parka (Kamleika) Inuit.JPG|175px|thumb|right|A traditional [[Inuit]] ''anorak'']]
[[Image:Eskimo Family NGM-v31-p564.jpg|175px|thumb|right|An Inuit family wearing traditional [[Reindeer|Caribou]] ''parkas'']]

A '''parka''' or '''anorak''' is a type of [[coat (clothing)|coat]] with a [[hood (headgear)|hood]], often [[lining (sewing)|lined]] with [[fur]] or [[faux fur]]. The [[Caribou Inuit]] invented this kind of garment, originally made from [[Reindeer|caribou]] or [[pinniped|seal]] skin, for [[hunting]] and [[kayaking]] in the frigid [[Arctic]]. Some Inuit anoraks require regular coating with [[fish oil]] to retain their water resistance.

The words ''anorak'' and ''parka'' have been used interchangeably, but they are somewhat different garments. Strictly speaking, an anorak is a waterproof, hooded, pull-over jacket without a front opening, and sometimes [[drawstring]]s at the waist and cuffs, and a parka is a hip-length cold-weather coat, typically stuffed with [[down feather|down]] or very warm [[synthetic fiber]], and with a fur-lined hood.

==Etymology==
The word ''anorak'' comes from the [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] (''Kalaallisut'') word ''annoraaq''. It did not appear in English until 1924; an early definition is "a beaded item worn by Greenland women or brides in the 1930s". In the early 1950s it was made from [[nylon]], but changed to [[poplin]] by 1959, when it was featured in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine as a fashion item. In 1984, ''[[The Observer]]'' used the term to refer to the type of people who wore it and subsequently, in the United Kingdom, it is sometimes used as a mildly [[Anorak (slang)|derogatory term]].&lt;ref name=Games2007&gt;{{citation|last=Games|first=Alex|year=2007|title=Balderdash &amp; piffle : one sandwich short of a dog's dinner|isbn=978-1-84607-235-2|publisher=BBC|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''parka'' is derived from the [[Nenets languages|Nenets]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parka |title="parka" in '&amp;#39;Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary'&amp;#39; |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Aleutian Islands]] the word simply means "animal skin".&lt;ref&gt;Brewers Dictionary of 20th Century Phrase and Fable&lt;/ref&gt; It first entered the English written record in a 1625 work by [[Samuel Purchas]].

The [[Inuit]] who speak [[Inuktitut]] use parkas and have various terms related to them as follows:

== {{anchor|Snorkel parka}} N-3B ("scrub snorkel" or "snorkel") parka==
[[Image:Snorkel parka.jpg|175px|thumb|left|A civilian snorkel parka manufactured in the 1980s by Lord Anthony.]]
The original '''snorkel parka''' ([[USAF]] N-3B parka, which is 3/4 length and has a full, attached hood; the similar N-2B parka is waist-length and has an attached split hood) was developed in the United States during the early 1950s for military use, mainly for flight crews stationed in extremely cold areas. It was designed for use in areas with temperatures as low as to {{Convert|-60|F}}. Originally made with a sage green [[DuPont]] flight silk [[nylon]] outer and lining it was padded with a wool [[blanket]] type material until the mid-1970s when the padding was changed to [[polyester]] wadding making the jacket both lighter and warmer. The outer shell material also was changed to a sage green cotton-nylon blend, with respective percentages 80–20, 65–35, and 50–50 being used at various times. 

It gained the common name of "snorkel parka" because the hood can be zipped right up leaving only a small tunnel (or snorkel) for the wearer to look out of.  This is particularly effective in very cold, windy weather although it has the added liabilities of seriously limiting the field of vision and hearing.  Earlier Vietnam-era hoods had genuine fur ruffs; later versions used synthetic furs. Original manufacturers of this parka for the government included Skyline, Southern Athletic, Lancer, Greenbrier, Workroom For Designers, Alpha, and Avirex. 

The basic N-3B parka design was copied and sold to the civilian market by many manufacturers with varying degrees of quality and faithfulness to the original government specifications. Surplus military parkas are often available for relatively low prices online and in [[surplus stores]]; they compare quite favorably with civilian extreme-cold parkas of all types due to their robust construction, designed for combat conditions, and warmth. 

The 1970s–1980s civilian version of the parka was made in many colors – navy blue, green, brown, black, maroon, grey, royal blue, sky blue and bright orange. Most had an orange diamond quilted nylon lining, although a very small number did have alternative colored linings such as yellow, pale blue, and green. While still manufacturing parkas to the military standard, Alpha Industries have more recently{{when|date=July 2018}} adopted the orange lining and a slimmer fit when producing their VF59 model parka which is now more popular than the military version.

In the late 1980s the snorkel parka came to be associated in the UK with [[trainspotter]]s, who would supposedly wear them, giving birth to the slang term there ''[[anorak (slang)|anorak]]''.  

In Europe the snorkel parka started to regain popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

==Fishtail parka==
[[Image:Fishtail Parka.jpg|thumb|right|M-51 fishtail parka. This was a favorite among the [[mod (subculture)|mod subculture]].]]
[[File:Oasis sunderland.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Liam Gallagher]] (left) of Britpop band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] wearing a fishtail parka at a concert in 2009.]]
The '''fishtail parka''' was first used by the [[United States Army]] in 1950 during the [[Korean War]]. Following the end of the Second World War the US army recognized the need for a new cold weather combat system, resulting in four main styles of fishtail parka: the EX-48,  M-48, M-51 and the M-65. The M stands for military, and the number is the year it was standardized. The EX-48 model was the first prototype or "experimental" precursor to all of them. 
The M-48 then being the first actual production model fishtail parka after the pattern being standardized on December 24, 1948.

The name ''fishtail'' comes from the fish tail extension at the back that could be folded up between the legs, much like a [[Uniforms_and_insignia_of_the_Luftwaffe#Knochensack|Knochensack]], and fixed using snap connectors to add wind-proofing. The fishtail was fixed at the front for warmth or folded away at the back to improve freedom of movement when needed.  

The EX-48 parka is distinctive as it has a left sleeve pocket and is made of thin poplin, only the later production M-48 parkas are made of the heavier sateen canvas type cotton. 
The EX-48 also has a thin fibre glass based liner that is very light and warm, the M-48 has a thicker wool pile liner with an integral hood liner made of wool. Both are distinguishable from any other type of parka by having the sleeve pocket. This was dropped for the M-51 onward. 
The fur ruff on the hood is also fixed to the shell of an EX-48/M-48 and is of wolf, coyote or often wolverine. The M-48 parka was costly to produce and therefore only in production for around one year. The pockets were wool lined both inside and out. The cuffs had two buttons for securing tightly around a wearer's wrist. The later more mass-produced M-51 parka had just the one cuff button. The liner had a built in chest pocket which again was unique to the M-48 parka.

The next revision was the M-51, made because the M48 was so good and of such high quality it was just too expensive to mass-produce.

The outer hood of the M-51 Fishtail Parka is integral to the parka shell, an added hood liner as well as a button in main liner make the M-51 a versatile 3 piece parka.
The idea behind this 3 part system was to enable a more customisable parka that allowed for easier cleaning of the shell as the hood fur was on the detachable hood liner, not fixed to the shell as in the M-48. It also allowed for both liners to be buttoned in or our depending on the temperature and hence warmth required. It was also cheaper than the M-48 to mass-produce
The early M-51 was made of heavy sateen cotton, the same material as the M-48. Later revisions of the M-51 were poplin based. The later liners were also revised from the "heavy when wet" wool pile to a lighter woolen loop or frieze wool design that dried easier and were far lighter. The frieze liners were constructed of mohair and were designed using a double loop system which repelled cold weather.

The M-65 fishtail parka has a detachable hood and was the last revision. It features a removable quilted liner made of light nylon / polyester batting which are modern synthetic materials. The M-65 fishtail parka first came into production in 1968.
These parkas featured synthetic fur on the hoods after an outcry from the fur lobby. As a result, only hoods for these parkas made in 1972 and for one year later have real fur.

Designed primarily for combat arms forces such as infantry, they are to be worn over other layers of clothing; alone, the fishtail parka is insufficient to protect against "dry cold" conditions (i.e. below about -10&amp;nbsp;°C). As such all fishtail parkas are big as they were designed to be worn over battle dress and other layers.

In the 1960s UK, the fishtail parka became a symbol of the [[mod (subculture)|mod]] [[subculture]]. Because of their practicality, cheapness and availability from [[army surplus]] shops, the parka was seen as the ideal garment for fending off the elements and protecting smarter clothes underneath from grease and dirt when on the mod's vehicle of choice, the [[scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]. Its place in popular culture was assured by newspaper pictures of parka-clad mods during the [[Mods and Rockers|Bank Holiday riots]] of the 1960s.

==Cagoule==
{{main|Cagoule (raincoat)}}
A cagoule is the [[British English]] term for a lightweight, weatherproof anorak or parka, usually unlined and sometimes knee-length.&lt;ref name="chambers"&gt;The Chambers Dictionary, 1994. {{ISBN|0-550-10255-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cagoule could be rolled up into a very compact package and carried in a bag or pocket. It was invented by Noel Bibby of [[Peter Storm (clothing)|Peter Storm Ltd]]. in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="invisible"&gt;Mike Parsons and Mary Rose, ''Invisible on Everest—innovation and the gear makers''. {{ISBN|0-9704143-5-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may have a full-zippered front opening, or pull over the head like an original anorak and close with snaps or a short zipper, has an integral hood, and elasticated or drawstring cuffs. In some versions, when rolled up, the hood doubles as a bag into which the rest of the coat is pushed. It became very popular in the United Kingdom during the 1970s.

[[File:Louis-Michel van Loo 001.jpg|thumb|Portrait of French polygraph [[Denis Diderot]] (1767, [[Louis-Michel van Loo]])]]
A '''polygraph''' (from [[Ancient Greek]]: πολύς, poly = "many" and γράφειν, graphein = "to write") is an author who writes in a variety of fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/polygraph Polygraph] (Dictionary.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

In literature, the term polygraph is often applied to certain writers of antiquity such as [[Aristotle]], [[Plutarch]], [[Varro]], [[Cicero]] and [[Pliny the Elder]]. Polygraphs still existed in the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], but, other than writers of books for children, they have become rarer in modern times due to the specialisation of knowledge. [[Voltaire]] and [[Diderot#Bibliography|Diderot]] are examples of modern polygraphs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10417">[[File:Amore e Psiche,Canova (1757-1822), Retro.JPG|thumb|right|Rear view of the [[Louvre]]'s prime version of [[Antonio Canova]]'s ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]'', 1793]]
In the [[art world]], if an artwork exists in several versions, the one known or believed to be the earliest is called the '''prime version'''.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (2001), 21&lt;/ref&gt;   Many artworks produced in media such as [[painting]] or carved [[sculpture]] which create unique objects are in fact repeated by their artists, often several times.  It is regarded as a matter of some importance both by [[art historian]]s and the art market to establish which version has "priority", that is to say was the original work.  The presumption usually is that the prime version is the finest, and perhaps the most carefully done, though some later versions can be argued to improve on the originals.  

In many periods the later "repetitions" were often produced by the workshop of the master, with varying degrees of supervision and direct attention from him.  This was especially the case with official portraits of monarchs and politicians, which in the Early Modern period were often ordered in large numbers of versions from the court artist as [[diplomatic gift]]s.  Sometimes "reduced versions" that are considerably smaller than the prime one are made. 

==Contexts==
[[File:Pope Julius II.jpg|thumb|left|The London version of ''[[Portrait of Pope Julius II (Raphael)|Portrait of Pope Julius II]]'' by [[Raphael]], 1511–12, recognized since 1970 as the prime version]]

In the case of official portraits the later creation of replica versions was likely to have been anticipated from the start, as in other types of art such as [[printmaking]], but in other types of painting, especially [[history painting]], the normal presumption, in the past as today, was that each work was a unique creation.  This was a matter of some importance to the owner, and there was evidently in some periods a general understanding that a work should not be replicated or copied without the permission of the owner of the prime version, which needed to be asked for carefully and was not always given.  In many periods "replicas were the direct product of collecting, as collectors have always preferred recognizable masterpieces to what is offbeat".&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (2001), 21&lt;/ref&gt;  

This was true of 17th century Rome, where artists such as [[Orazio Gentileschi]] and [[Bernardo Strozzi]] routinely made replicas, and others such as [[Guercino]] and [[Guido Reni]] sometimes did,&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (2001), 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; as of Victorian London, where artists such as [[William Powell Frith]] often painted one or more replica versions of their successes.  In Frith's case the replicas were painted many years after his first versions, when his newer work was achieving less success.  The French painter {{Interlanguage link multi|Charles Landelle|fr}} recorded no fewer than 32 versions of his ''Femme Fellah'', an [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] hit at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Pieces of sculpture made by [[casting]] processes that allow the original model to be reproduced several times are rather different; though the first in an edition (today often kept by the artist) has some added prestige, it is expected that a number of versions will be made.

[[File:Aeneas' Flight from Troy by Federico Barocci.jpg|thumb|''Aeneas' Flight from Troy by [[Federico Barocci]]'', image of the replica version in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/47.100.1023|title=Agostino Carracci after Federico Barocci: Aeneas and His Family Fleeing Troy (47.100.1023) - Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History - The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An example of a work now only known from a replica (in the [[Galleria Borghese]] in Rome) and studies is ''[[Aeneas]] and his Family Fleeing Troy'', the only secular [[history painting]] by [[Federico Barocci]]. The prime version was given in 1586 by [[Francesco Maria II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino|Francesco Maria II]], the last [[Duke of Urbino]], to [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in Prague, and was later looted by the Swedes. It was taken to Rome by Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], passed to the [[Orleans collection]] in Paris, and finally sold at auction in London for 14 guineas in 1800 (the price probably reflecting the poor condition some sources mention), since when its whereabouts are unknown.  The Rome version was painted in 1598, presumably for Cardinal [[Scipio Borghese]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Nicholas, ''Federico Barocci'', 2000, Vilo (109)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judging the prime version==
In some cases it is evident which version of a work is prime, especially if there is a full [[provenance]] including a contract or other documentation of the original commission; a contract for a copy will normally make that clear.  Otherwise experts will look both at the overall quality of the work, and also technical elements such as detailed [[underdrawing]] and [[pentimenti]] (changes of mind) that indicate that the artist was finalizing his idea of the work as he proceeded. [[Infrared]] and [[X-ray]] photography are among the scientific techniques that may help in discovering these technical issues.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1986), 436-438, and 432, provide examples of such discussions, relating to various paintings by Caravaggio&lt;/ref&gt;  Close comparison with the evolving style of other works by the artist and the comparison, ideally physically side by side, between two rival versions will often lead to a clear conclusion,&lt;ref&gt;Millar&lt;/ref&gt; but sometimes arguments between experts may take decades to reach a conclusion, as with other issues of attribution.  

One of the most dramatic reassessments in recent decades, of a very important work, came  in 1970 when a new assessment of a version of the ''[[Portrait of Pope Julius II (Raphael)|Portrait of Pope Julius II]]'' by [[Raphael]] drew on a combination of new scientific research and archival knowledge, as x-rays revealed an inventory number from 1693, as well as a background that Raphael had repainted.  The version in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]], previously considered prime, was replaced by the version in the [[National Gallery, London]], previously considered a replica.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkerton and Roy, 757-759, which reports further testing modifying the earlier conclusions of Gould, 208-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*[[Leonardo da Vinci]], ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]''; prime [[Louvre]], second version [[National Gallery, London]]
*[[Antonio Canova]], ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]''; prime Louvre (completed 1793), other versions [[Hermitage Museum]] (1796) and elsewhere. An example of a relatively recent work where documentary evidence means that the prime version has never been in dispute. 
*[[William Powell Frith]], ''[[The Derby Day]]''; prime (1858) [[Tate Britain]], second version (1893–94) [[Manchester City Art Gallery]], plus a much smaller but highly finished "original study", sold at [[Christie's]] for £505,250 in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16216133 Re-discovered William Powell Frith sells at auction], BBC News, 16 December 2011; [http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5521063 Sale of study], Christie's, lot details 15 December 2011, Frith ''Derby Day''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ary Scheffer]], ''[[Francesca da Rimini and Paolo Malatesta Appraised by Dante and Virgil]]'' (and variant titles).  Probably his best-known work; over 15 years after the original he produced several smaller versions.  The prime version, from 1835, measures {{convert|166.5|by|234|cm}}; now [[Wallace Collection]] in London. The second version (1854), measuring {{convert|51.7|by|81.3|cm}}, is in the [[Hamburger Kunsthalle]]. The third version (1855) is now in the [[Louvre]]. Another version from 1851 measuring {{convert|24.7|by|33.2|cm}} is in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1980.40 |publisher=Cleveland Museum of Art |accessdate=11 September 2015 |title=Dante and Virgil Meeting the Shades of Francesca da Rimini and Paolo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Carnegie Museum of Art]] in [[Pittsburgh]] has another version.&lt;ref&gt;[https://museumnetwork.sothebys.com/museum/carnegie-museum-of-art/exhibition/visions-of-order-and-chaos-the-enlightened-eye Ary Scheffer, ''Dante and Virgil Encountering the Shades of Francesca da Rimini and Paolo Malatesta in the Underworld'', (detail) 1851, oil on canvas, Heinz Family Fund and Anonymous gift, CMOA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Far more work has gone into reconstructing PIE than any other [[proto-language]], and it is by far the best understood of all proto-languages of its age. The vast majority of linguistic work during the 19th century was devoted to the reconstruction of PIE or its daughter proto-languages (such as [[Proto-Germanic]]), and most of the modern techniques of linguistic reconstruction such as the [[comparative method]] were developed as a result. These methods supply all current knowledge concerning PIE since there is no written record of the language.

PIE is estimated to have been spoken as a single language from 4500&amp;nbsp;BC to 2500&amp;nbsp;BC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/exclusives/articles/1302-proto-indo-european-schleichers-fable |title=Telling Tales in Proto-Indo-European |work=Archaeology |last=Powell |first=Eric A. |access-date=2017-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the Late [[Neolithic]] to Early [[Bronze Age]], though estimates vary by more than a thousand years. According to the prevailing [[Kurgan hypothesis]], the [[proto-Indo-European homeland|original homeland]] of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] may have been in the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]] of Eastern Europe. The linguistic reconstruction of PIE has also provided insight into the [[proto-Indo-European culture|culture]] and [[proto-Indo-European religion|religion]] of its speakers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Indo-European language and culture: an introduction |last=Fortson |first=Benjamin W. |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=1405103159 |location=Malden, Mass |page=16 |oclc=54529041 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Proto-Indo-Europeans became isolated from each other through the [[Indo-European migrations]], the Proto-Indo-European language became spoken by the various groups in regional [[dialect]]s which then underwent the [[Indo-European sound laws]] divergence, and along with shifts in morphology, these dialects slowly but eventually transformed into the known ancient Indo-European [[language]]s. From there, further linguistic divergence led to the evolution of their current descendants, the modern Indo-European languages. Today, the descendant languages, or daughter languages, of PIE with the most native speakers are [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]]),  [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[German language|German]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Marathi language|Marathi]]. Hundreds of other living descendants of PIE range from languages as diverse as [[Albanian language|Albanian]] ({{lang|sq|gjuha shqipe}}), [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] ({{lang|ku-Arab|کوردی}}), [[Nepali language|Nepali]] ({{lang|ne|खस भाषा}}), [[Tsakonian language|Tsakonian]] ({{lang|tsd|τσακώνικα}}), [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] ({{lang|uk|українська мова}}), and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ({{lang|cy|Cymraeg}}).

PIE had an elaborate system of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] that included [[inflection|inflectional suffixes]] (analogous to English ''life, lives, life's, lives'&amp;zwj;'')&lt;!-- ZWJ because {{'}} includes a 0.1em space before the apostrophe --&gt; as well as [[indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] (vowel alterations, for example, as preserved in English ''sing, sang, sung'') and [[proto-Indo-European accent|accent]]. PIE [[proto-Indo-European nominals|nominals]] and [[proto-Indo-European pronouns|pronouns]] had a complex system of declension, and [[Proto-Indo-European verbs|verbs]] similarly had a complex system of conjugation. The PIE [[proto-Indo-European phonology|phonology]], [[proto-Indo-European particles|particles]], [[proto-Indo-European numerals|numerals]], and [[indo-European copula|copula]] are also well-reconstructed.

An asterisk is used to mark reconstructed words, such as *''{{PIE|wódr̥}}'' '[[water]]', *''{{PIE|ḱwṓ}}'' '[[dog]]' (English ''hound''), or *''{{PIE|tréyes}}'' 'three (masculine)'.

==Development of the hypothesis==
No direct evidence of PIE remains – scholars have reconstructed PIE from its present-day descendants using the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/linguistics/The-comparative-method#toc35116|title=Linguistics – The comparative method {{!}} science|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Encyclopedia Brittanica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comparative method follows the [[Neogrammarian]] rule: the [[Indo-European sound laws]] apply without exception. The method compares languages and uses the sound laws to find a common ancestor. For example, compare the pairs of words in Italian and English: ''piede'' and ''foot'', ''padre'' and ''father'', ''pesce'' and ''fish''. Since there is a consistent correspondence of the initial consonants that emerges far too frequently to be coincidental, one can assume that these languages stem from a common [[parent language | parent-language]].&lt;ref name="comp-ling"&gt;{{cite web|title= Comparative linguistics|url= https://www.britannica.com/science/comparative-linguistics|website= Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate= 27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many consider [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], an [[Anglo-Welsh]] [[Philology|philologist]] and [[puisne judge]] in [[Bengal]], to have begun Indo-European studies in 1786, when he postulated the common ancestry of [[Sanskrit]], [[Latin]], and [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Jones-British-orientalist-and-jurist|title= Sir William Jones {{!}} British orientalist and jurist|access-date= 3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was not the first to make this observation. In the 1500s, European visitors to the Indian subcontinent became aware of similarities between [[Indo-Iranian language]]s and European languages,&lt;ref name="auroux"&gt;{{cite book|first= Sylvain|last= Auroux|title= History of the Language Sciences|page= 1156|isbn= 3-11-016735-2|publisher= Walter de Gruyter|location= Berlin, New York|year= 2000|url= https://books.google.com/?id=yasNy365EywC&amp;pg=PA1156&amp;vq=stephens+sassetti&amp;dq=3110167352}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as early as 1653 [[Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn]] had published a proposal for a [[proto-language]] ("Scythian") for the following language families: [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Romance languages|Romance]], [[Hellenic languages|Greek]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], and [[Iranian languages|Iranian]].&lt;ref name="Blench"&gt;[[Roger Blench]], [http://www.rogerblench.info/Archaeology/World/CH4-BLENCH.pdf Archaeology and Language: methods and issues]. In: ''A Companion To Archaeology''. J. Bintliff ed. 52–74. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In a memoir sent to the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] in 1767 [[Gaston-Laurent Coeurdoux]], a French Jesuit who spent all his life in India, had specifically demonstrated the analogy between Sanskrit and European languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Kip|last= Wheeler|title= The Sanskrit Connection: Keeping Up With the Joneses|url= http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/IE_Main4_Sanskrit.html|publisher= Dr.Wheeler's Website|accessdate= 16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some ways, Jones' work was less accurate than his predecessors', as he erroneously included [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] in the Indo-European languages, while omitting [[Hindi]].

In 1818 [[Rasmus Christian Rask]] elaborated the set of correspondences to include other Indo-European languages, such as Sanskrit and Greek, and the full range of consonants involved. In 1816 [[Franz Bopp]] published ''On the System of Conjugation in Sanskrit'' in which he investigated a common origin of Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, and German. In 1833 he began publishing the ''Comparative Grammar of Sanskrit, [[Avestan|Zend]], Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Old Slavic, Gothic, and German''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.britannica.com/biography/Franz-Bopp|title= Franz Bopp {{!}} German philologist|access-date= 26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1822 [[Jacob Grimm]] formulated what became known as [[Grimm's law]] as a general rule in his ''Deutsche Grammatik''. Grimm showed correlations between the Germanic and other Indo-European languages and demonstrated that sound change systematically transforms all words of a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/Grimms-law|title= Grimm's law {{!}} linguistics|access-date= 26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1870s the Neogrammarians proposed that sound laws have no exceptions, as shown in [[Verner's law]], published in 1876, which resolved apparent exceptions to Grimm's law by exploring the role that accent (stress) had played in language change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.britannica.com/science/Neogrammarian|title= Neogrammarian {{!}} German scholar|access-date= 26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[August Schleicher]]'s ''A Compendium of the Comparative Grammar of the Indo-European, Sanskrit, Greek and Latin Languages'' (1874–77) represented an early attempt to reconstruct the proto-Indo-European language.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1900s [[Indo-Europeanist]]s had developed well-defined descriptions of PIE which scholars still accept today. Later, the discovery of the [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] and [[Tocharian languages]] added to the corpus of descendant languages. A new principle won wide acceptance in the [[laryngeal theory]], which explained irregularities in the [[linguistic reconstruction]] of Proto-Indo-European phonology as the effects of hypothetical sounds which had disappeared from all documented languages, but which were later observed in excavated cuneiform tablets in Anatolian.

[[Julius Pokorny]]'s ''[[Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch]]'' ("Indo-European Etymological Dictionary", 1959) gave a detailed, though conservative, overview of the lexical knowledge then accumulated. Kuryłowicz's 1956 ''Apophonie'' gave a better understanding of [[Indo-European ablaut]]. From the 1960s, knowledge of Anatolian became robust enough to establish its relationship to PIE.

==Historical and geographical setting==
Multiple hypotheses have been suggested about when, where, and by whom PIE was spoken. The [[Kurgan hypothesis]], first put forward by [[Marija Gimbutas]], is the most popular of these.&lt;ref name="anth-ringe"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ringe|first2=Done|date=2015|title=The Indo-European Homeland from Linguistic and Archaeological Perspectives|journal=Annual Review of Linguistics|volume=1|pages=199–219|last1=Anthony|first1=David W.|doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-124812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of the Indo-Europeans|date=1991|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=978-0500276167|page=185|last1=Mallory|first1=J. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes that the [[Yamna culture]] of the [[Kurgan]]s from the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]] north of the Black Sea were the original speakers of PIE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Horse, the Wheel, and Language|The horse, the wheel, and language: how bronze-age riders from the Eurasian steppes shaped the modern world]]|date=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-05887-3|edition=8th reprint.|location=Princeton, N.J.|last1=Anthony|first1=David W.|authorlink1=David W.

According to the theory, PIE became widespread because its speakers, the Kurgans, were able to migrate into a vast area of Europe and Asia, thanks to technologies such as the [[domestication of the horse]], [[herding]], and the use of wheeled vehicles.&lt;ref name ="Science" /&gt;

The people of these cultures were [[Eurasian nomads|nomadic pastoralists]], who, according to the model, by the early 3rd millennium BC had expanded throughout the Pontic–Caspian steppe and into Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gimbutas|first=Marija|year=1985|title=Primary and Secondary Homeland of the Indo-Europeans: comments on Gamkrelidze-Ivanov articles|url=|journal=Journal of Indo-European Studies|volume=13|issue=1–2|pages=185–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories include the [[Anatolian hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="bouckaert"&gt;{{Citation|title=Mapping the Origins and Expansion of the Indo-European Language Family|date=24 August 2012|last1=Bouckaert|last2=Lemey|last3=Dunn|last4=Greenhill|last5=Alekseyenko|last6=Drummond|last7=Gray|last8=Suchard|first1=Remco|first2=P.|first3=M.|first4=S.

Common subgroups of Indo-European languages which are proposed include [[Italo-Celtic]], [[Graeco-Aryan]], [[Graeco-Armenian]], [[Graeco-Phrygian]], [[Daco-Thracian]], and [[Thraco-Illyrian]].

===Marginally attested languages===
The [[Lusitanian language]] is a marginally attested language found in the area of modern [[Portugal]].

The [[Paleo-Balkan languages]], which occur in or near the [[Balkan peninsula]], do not appear to be members of any of the subfamilies of PIE but are so poorly attested that proper classification of them is not possible. Albanian and Greek are the only surviving Indo-European languages in the group.

==Phonology==
{{Main article|Proto-Indo-European phonology}}

Proto-Indo-European [[phonology]] has been reconstructed in some detail. Notable features of the most widely accepted (but not uncontroversial) reconstruction include:
*three series of [[stop consonant]]s reconstructed as [[voiceless consonant|voiceless]], [[voiced consonant|voiced]], and [[breathy voice]]d;
*[[sonorant]] consonants that could be used [[syllabic consonant|syllabically]]; 
*three so-called [[laryngeal theory|laryngeal]] consonants, whose exact pronunciation is not well-established but which are believed to have existed in part based on their visible effects on adjacent sounds; 
*the [[fricative]] /s/; and 
*a five-[[vowel]] system of which /e/ and /o/ were the most frequently occurring vowels.

The [[Proto-Indo-European accent]] is reconstructed today as having had variable lexical stress, which could appear on any syllable and whose position often varied among different members of a paradigm (e.g. between singular and plural of a verbal paradigm). Stressed syllables received a higher pitch; therefore it is often said that PIE had [[Pitch-accent language|pitch accent]]. The location of the stress is associated with ablaut variations, especially between normal-grade vowels (/e/ and /o/) and zero-grade (i.e. lack of a vowel), but not entirely predictable from it.

The accent is best preserved in [[Vedic Sanskrit]] and (in the case of nouns) [[Ancient Greek]], and indirectly attested in a number of phenomena in other IE languages. To account for mismatches between the accent of Vedic Sanskrit and Ancient Greek, as well as a few other phenomena, a few historical linguists prefer to reconstruct PIE as a [[Tone (linguistics)|tone language]] where each [[morpheme]] had an inherent tone; the sequence of tones in a word then evolved, according to that hypothesis, into the placement of lexical stress in different ways in different IE branches.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Morphology==
===Root===
[[Proto-Indo-European root]]s were [[affix]]-lacking [[morpheme]]s which carried the core [[Lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] meaning of a word and were used to derive related words (e.g., "-''friend''-" in the English words "''befriend''", "''friends''", and "''friend''" by itself). Proto-Indo-European was a [[fusional language]], in which inflectional morphemes signalled the grammatical relationships between words. This dependence on inflectional morphemes means that roots in PIE, unlike those found in English, were rarely found by themselves. A root plus a [[suffix]] formed a [[word stem]], and a word stem plus a desinence (usually an ending) formed a word.{{sfnp|Fortson|2004|p=16}}

===Ablaut===
Many morphemes in Proto-Indo-European had short ''e'' as their inherent vowel; the [[Indo-European ablaut]] is the change of this short ''e'' to short ''o'', long ''e'' (ē), long ''o'' (''ō''), or no vowel. This variation in vowels occurred both within [[inflectional morphology]] (e.g., different grammatical forms of a noun or verb may have different vowels) and [[derivational morphology]] (e.g., a verb and an associated abstract [[verbal noun]] may have different vowels).{{sfnp|Fortson|2004|pp=73–74}}

Categories that PIE distinguished through ablaut were often also identifiable by contrasting endings, but the loss of these endings in some later Indo-European languages has led them to use ablaut alone to identify grammatical categories, as in the Modern English words ''sing'', ''sang'', ''sung''.

===Noun===
[[Proto-Indo-European nominals|Proto-Indo-European nouns]] are declined for eight or nine cases:{{sfnp|Fortson|2004|p=102}}
*[[Nominative case|nominative]]: marks the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of a verb, such as ''They'' in ''They ate''. Words that follow a linking verb and rename the subject of that verb also use the nominative case. Thus, both ''They'' and ''linguists'' are in the nominative case in ''They are linguists''. The nominative is the dictionary form of the noun.
*[[Accusative case|accusative]]: used for the [[direct object]] of a [[transitive verb]].
*[[genitive case|genitive]]: marks a [[noun]] as modifying another noun.
*[[Dative case|dative]]:  used to indicate the indirect object of a transitive verb, such as ''Jacob'' in ''Maria gave Jacob a drink''.
*[[Instrumental case|instrumental]]: marks the ''instrument'' or means by, or with which, the subject achieves or accomplishes an action. It may be either a physical object or an abstract concept.
*[[ablative case|ablative]]: used to express motion away from something.
*[[locative case|locative]]: corresponds vaguely to the English prepositions ''in'', ''on'', ''at'', and ''by''.
*[[Vocative case|vocative]]: used for a word that identifies an addressee. A vocative expression is one of direct address where the identity of the party spoken to is set forth expressly within a sentence. For example, in the sentence, "I don't know, John", ''John'' is a vocative expression that indicates the party being addressed.
*[[allative case|allative]]: used as a type of [[locative case]] that expresses movement towards something. Only the Anatolian languages maintain this case, and it may not have existed in Proto-Indo-European at all.{{sfnp|Fortson|2004|pp=102, 105}}
There were three [[grammatical gender]]s:
* masculine
* feminine
* neuter

===Pronoun===
[[Proto-Indo-European pronouns]] are difficult to reconstruct, owing to their variety in later languages.  PIE had personal [[pronoun]]s in the first and second [[grammatical person]], but not the third person, where [[demonstrative pronoun]]s were used instead. The personal pronouns had their own unique forms and endings, and some had [[Suppletion|two distinct stems]]; this is most obvious in the first person singular where the two stems are still preserved in English ''I'' and ''me''. There were also two varieties for the accusative, genitive and dative cases, a stressed and an [[enclitic]] form.&lt;ref name="beekes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beekes|first1=Robert|last2=Gabriner|first2=Paul|title=Comparative Indo-European linguistics: an introduction|date=1995|publisher=J.

===Verb===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Vedic Sanskrit grammar]] --&gt;
[[Proto-Indo-European verbs]], like the nouns, exhibited a system of ablaut. The most basic categorization for the Indo-European verb was [[grammatical aspect]]. Verbs were classed as:
*[[stative verb|stative]]: verbs that depict a state of being
*[[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]: verbs depicting ongoing, habitual or repeated action
*[[perfective aspect|perfective]]: verbs depicting a completed action or actions viewed as an entire process.
Verbs have at least four [[grammatical mood]]s:
*[[indicative mood|indicative]]: indicates that something is a statement of fact; in other words, to express what the speaker considers to be a known state of affairs, as in [[declarative sentence]]s.
*[[imperative mood|imperative]]: forms commands or requests, including the giving of prohibition or permission, or any other kind of advice or exhortation.
*[[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]]: used to express various states of unreality such as wish, emotion, possibility, judgment, opinion, obligation, or action that has not yet occurred
*[[optative mood|optative]]: indicates a wish or hope. It is similar to the [[cohortative mood]] and is closely related to the [[subjunctive mood]].
Verbs had two [[grammatical voice]]s:
* [[active voice|active]]: used in a clause whose subject expresses the main verb's [[Agent (grammar)|agent]].
*[[mediopassive voice|mediopassive]]: for the [[middle voice]] and the [[passive voice]].
Verbs had three [[grammatical person]]s: (first, second and third)

Verbs had three [[grammatical number]]s:
*singular
*[[dual grammatical number|dual]]: referring to precisely two of the entities (objects or persons) identified by the noun or pronoun.
*[[plural]]: a number other than singular or dual.
Verbs were also marked by a highly developed system of [[participle]]s, one for each combination of tense and voice, and an assorted array of [[verbal noun]]s and adjectival formations.

The following table shows a possible reconstruction of the PIE verb endings from Sihler, which largely represents the current consensus among Indo-Europeanists.

===Numbers===
[[Proto-Indo-European numerals]] are generally reconstructed as follows:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
!
!'''Sihler'''&lt;ref name="sihler"/&gt;
|-
|one
|{{PIE|*(H)óynos/*(H)óywos/*(H)óyk(ʷ)os; *sḗm}}
|-
|two
|{{PIE|*d(u)wóh₁}}
|-
|three
|{{PIE|*tréyes}} (full grade), {{PIE|*tri-}} ''(zero grade)''
|-
|four
|{{PIE|*kʷetwóres}} (''o''-grade), {{PIE|*kʷ(e)twr̥-}} ''(zero grade)''&lt;br /&gt;(''see also the [[kʷetwóres rule]]'')
|-
|five
|{{PIE|*pénkʷe}}
|-
|six
|{{PIE|*s(w)éḱs}}; ''originally perhaps'' {{PIE|*wéḱs}}
|-
|seven
|{{PIE|*septḿ̥}}

|{{PIE|*oḱtṓ(w)}} ''or'' {{PIE|*h₃eḱtṓ(w)}}
|-
|nine
|{{PIE|*h₁néwn̥}}
|-
|ten
|{{PIE|*déḱm̥(t)}}
|}
Rather than specifically 100, {{PIE|''*ḱm̥tóm''}} may originally have meant "a large number".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lehmann|first=Winfried P|title=Theoretical Bases of Indo-European Linguistics|year=1993|postscript=|pages=252–55|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-08201-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Particle===
[[Proto-Indo-European particles]] could be used both as [[adverb]]s and [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], like {{PIE|''*upo''}} "under, below". The postpositions became prepositions in most daughter languages. Other reconstructible particles include [[Affirmative and negative|negators]] ({{PIE|''*ne, *mē''}}), [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] ({{PIE|''*kʷe''}} "and", {{PIE|''*wē''}} "or" and others) and an [[interjection]] ({{PIE|''*wai!''}}, an expression of woe or agony).

==Syntax==
The [[syntax]] of the older Indo-European languages has been studied in earnest since at least the late nineteenth century, by such scholars as [[Hermann Hirt]] and [[Berthold Delbrück]]. In the second half of the twentieth century, interest in the topic increased and led to reconstructions of Proto-Indo-European syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Preface |encyclopedia=Proto-Indo-European Syntax and its Development |editor1-first=Leonid |editor1-last=Kulikov |editor2-first=Nikolaos |editor2-last=Lavidas |publisher=John Benjamins |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since all the early attested IE languages were inflectional, PIE is thought to have relied primarily on morphological markers, rather than [[word order]], to signal [[syntax|syntactic]] relationships within sentences.{{r|eiec}} Still, a default ([[Markedness|unmarked]]) word order is thought to have existed in PIE. This was reconstructed by [[Jacob Wackernagel]] as being [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO), based on evidence in Vedic Sanskrit, and the SVO hypothesis still has some adherents, but {{as of|2015|lc=y}} the "broad consensus" among PIE scholars is that PIE would have been a [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV) language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Proto-Indo-European verb-finality: Reconstruction, typology, validation |first=Hans Henrich |last=Hock |authorlink=Hans Henrich Hock |encyclopedia=Proto-Indo-European Syntax and its Development |editor1-first=Leonid |editor1-last=Kulikov |editor2-first=Nikolaos |editor2-last=Lavidas |publisher=John Benjamins |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SOV default word order with other orders used to express emphasis (e.g., [[verb–subject–object]] to emphasise the verb) is attested in [[Old Indic]], [[Old Iranian]], [[Old Latin]] and [[Hittite language|Hittite]], while traces of it can be found in the [[enclitic]] personal pronouns of the [[Tocharian languages]].&lt;ref name="eiec"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |editor-first1=J. P. |editor-last1=Mallory |editor-first2=Douglas Q. |editor-last2=Adams |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]] |title=Proto-Indo-European |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1997 |page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shift from OV to VO order is posited to have occurred in late PIE since many of the descendant languages have this order: modern Greek, [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Albanian language|Albanian]] prefer SVO, [[Insular Celtic]] has VSO as the default order, and even the [[Anatolian languages]] show some signs of this word order shift.{{r|lehmann}} The inconsistent order preference in Baltic, Slavic and Germanic can be attributed to contact with outside OV languages.&lt;ref name="lehmann"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Proto_Indo_European_syntax.html?id=KQZZAAAAMAAJ|title=Proto-Indo-European Syntax|last=Lehmann|first=Winfred P.|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1974|isbn=|location=|page=250|pages=|authorlink=Winfred P. Lehmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The [[Ridley Scott]] film ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' features an android named "David" (played by [[Michael Fassbender]]) who learns Proto-Indo-European to communicate with the "Engineer", an extraterrestrial whose race may have created humans. David practices PIE by reciting [[Schleicher's fable]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Roush |first=George |date=20 June 2012 |title='Prometheus' Secret Revealed: What Did David Say to the Engineer |url=http://screencrush.com/prometheus/ |publisher=[[Screen Crush]] |access-date=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and goes on to attempt communication with the Engineer through PIE. Linguist Dr Anil Biltoo created the film's reconstructed dialogue and had an onscreen role teaching David Schleicher's fable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=O'Brien |first=Lucy |date=14 October 2012 |title=Designing Prometheus |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/15/designing-prometheus |publisher=[[IGN]] |access-date=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Longhai - P1260558.JPG|thumb|City People's Procuratorate office in [[Longhai City]], Fujian, China]]
A '''public procurator''' is an officer of a [[Jurisdiction (area)|state]] charged with both the investigation and prosecution of crime.  The office is a feature of a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]] rather than [[common law]] [[adversarial system]].  [[Japan]] uses a procuratorial system, in addition to countries such as [[China]], [[Russian Federation|Russia]] and [[Indonesia]].  The office of a procurator is called a '''procuracy''' or '''procuratorate'''. The terms are from Latin and originate with the [[procurator (Roman)|procurators]] of the [[Roman Empire]].

== Plot ==

=== Setting ===
''Rayman 2'' takes place in a world called the Glade of Dreams, and revolves around its invasion and occupation by an armada of interstellar Robo-Pirates, led by [[Rayman#Antagonists|Admiral Razorbeard]]. Prior to the invasion, the Robo-Pirates destroyed over one hundred planets in the galaxy, with the intention of enslaving their inhabitants. Upon the invasion of the Glade of Dreams, the Robo-Pirates were battled against by [[Rayman (character)|Rayman]], [[Globox]], and other allies. After some battles, Rayman's capture occurs after the explosion of the Primordial Core. [[Rayman#Protagonists|Ly the Fairy]] telepathically communicates with Rayman explaining the consequences of the damage, with the core's shattering into 1000 Yellow Lums, and the capture of many fighters. Rayman's powers are also lost due to this, and he finds himself captured by the Robo-Pirates at the beginning of the game.

=== Story ===
[[File:Rayman 2 screenshot 1.jpg|thumb|left|240px|In this cutscene, Rayman gives one of the four masks to Polokus, the spirit of the world.]]
The destruction of the world's core greatly weakens and disables Rayman's powers, which leads to his subsequent capture and imprisonment aboard the ''Buccaneer'', a prison ship. Globox, a friend of Rayman, is also captured and put in the same cell as Rayman aboard the ''Buccaneer''. Globox gives Rayman a Silver Lum given to him by Ly the fairy, which temporarily restores some of his powers. Rayman escapes the prison ship through a chute, however during the escape he once again separates from Globox. After falling from the ship, Rayman eventually finds himself in the Woods of Light. Rayman decides that his best chance is to find Ly, and begins his search through the forest. He comes across [[Rayman#Protagonists|Murphy]], a "flying encyclopaedia", who serves as Rayman's guide throughout the game, as well as three of Globox's children. Rayman sadly informs them of his separation with Globox, much to their dismay. The children inform Rayman that Ly has been captured by Robo-Pirates and has been taken deeper into the forest.

Traversing deeper into the forest, Rayman frees a group of [[Rayman#Protagonists|Teensies]]—small creatures with magical abilities—whom were locked in a cage. After bickering amongst themselves about who among them is their king, they inform Rayman of the Ly's location in a stronghold within the Fairy Glade. They allow Rayman access to the Hall of Doors for the cost of some Yellow Lums. Once collected, the King Teensie creates a network of portals that connect the Hall of Doors, which Rayman uses in order to access various areas throughout the Glade of Dreams. Eventually, Rayman finds Ly being held captive in a force field within the Fairy Glade. After being freed, Rayman tells Ly of his separation with Globox and his loss of powers. Due to the destruction of the Heart of the World, Ly is unable to restore Rayman's powers. However, she tells Rayman of four ancient masks, through which [[Rayman#Protagonists|Polokus]], the spirit of the world, must be awakened in order to defeat the Robo-Pirates. The four masks are hidden in secret sanctuaries consisting of the four elements; water/ice, earth/stone, fire, and air. Ly informs Rayman that his only hope is to find the four masks, defeat their guardians, and awaken Polokus.

Concerned by Rayman's progress, Admiral Razorbeard dispatches several warships to pursue and kill him. Rayman approaches the entrance to the Sanctuary of Water and Ice, the location in which the first of the four masks is contained. He defeats its guardian, Axel, in combat and collects the first mask, which teleports him to the realm where Polokus rests eternally. Speaking to Rayman through his dreams, Polokus congratulates him on his find, and urges him to collect the three remaining masks. Rayman travels to the Menhir Hills, where he learns to tame and ride equine-like walking [[shell (projectile)|shells]]. Rayman acquaintances himself with Clark, a friendly giant, who has become terminally ill after accidentally swallowing a Robo-Pirate. He asks Rayman to retrieve the Elixir of Life from the Cave of Bad Dreams, a realm which can only be accessed if the occupant is asleep. Rayman asks a [[witch doctor]] to hypnotise him, which transports him to the Cave of Bad Dreams. Once there, Jano, the guardian of the [[Dream world (plot device)|dream world]], offers Rayman the choice of eternal wealth instead of taking the elixir. If the player accepts Jano's offer, a humorous ending will play, which depicts an overweight Rayman stranded on a small island, surrounded by treasure. Declining the offer will grant Rayman the elixir, which he uses to cure Clark.

Afterwards, Rayman reunites with Globox, who was captured by Robo-Pirates and brought to a remote detention facility. Globox reveals that he received another Silver Lum, which greatly enhances Rayman's offensive capabilities. After destroying a warship with his new powers, Rayman travels to Whale Bay, where he frees a benevolent whale, Carmen, who has been imprisoned by the pirates in order to use her blubber to oil the engines of their ships. Carmen informs Rayman of the second mask's location, which is situated in the Sanctuary of Stone and Fire. Its guardian, Umber, is an inanimate statue which Rayman uses to control in order to walk across lava and obtain the second mask. Once obtained and given to Polokus, Razorbeard becomes infuriated with Rayman's success and orders numerous fleets of warships to kill him. A group of warships ambush Rayman in a mountainous precipice and almost kill him, however he ultimately escapes.

Rayman collects the third mask at the Sanctuary of Rock and Lava, and obtains a new power from Ly which gives him the ability to fly. However the guardian of the sanctuary, Foutch, wounds Rayman which causes him to lose his ability of flight. After giving the third mask to Polokus, he teleports Rayman to the Iron Mountains, which houses a vast network of mines. Rayman encounters Uglette, wife of Globox, who is in despair after informing Rayman that dozens of her children are being used for labour in the mines, and Globox has once again been captured and sent to the ''Buccaneer''. Rayman hijacks a warship and rescues all of Globox's children from the mines. As Uglette and the children leave, one of the children passes Rayman the fourth mask, claiming that they found it in the mines. Rayman departs to see Polokus, who congratulates him on his work, and uses the power of all four masks to awaken himself. Polokus tells Rayman that he can destroy all Robo-Pirates in the Glade of Dreams, but he has no power in the air. Polokus then creates a portal which leads Rayman to the airborne ''Buccaneer'', in which he must defeat Admiral Razorbeard and save Globox.

On board the ''Buccaneer'', a general visits Razorbeard, who presents to him the Grolgoth, a large [[powered exoskeleton]] which makes the user invulnerable to damage. Razorbeard purchases it, and plans for his final confrontation with Rayman. Soon after, Rayman infiltrates the ''Buccaneer'' and finds both Razorbeard (housed inside the Grolgoth) and Globox in the [[crow's nest]] of the ship. During combat, Razorbeard accidentally collapses the floor, plunging both him and Rayman into a lava-filled furnace. During the descent, Ly telepathically saves Rayman from his fall and creates him a sentient flying shell, which he uses to knock the Grolgoth into the lava. Razorbeard escapes the ship in a small shuttlecraft, and initiates the self-destruct, which destroys the ''Buccaneer'' with Rayman still inside. Later, at Rayman's funeral, all gather for a memorial service. They could only recover Rayman's left shoe, however, the shoe suddenly appears to react to an oncoming presence, as a limping, one-footed Rayman emerges nearby, much to the joy of everyone present.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Ratman 2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Screenshot of the Fairy Glade, the second level of the game]]
The game is played from a third-person perspective and the player has control over the camera, though in some situations this control is limited to only certain angles. At several points in the game the player loses control during cut scenes, which typically show dialogue between characters.

By collecting lums, the player unlocks more information about the game world and its back story, which can be read by standing still and pressing a specific button for some time. Some back story is also obtained through (optional) instructions from Murfy, a "flying encyclopaedia" who provides explanations on all kinds of gameplay elements.

In contrast to its predecessor, which was a 2D platformer, ''Rayman 2'' is a 3D platformer. The player navigates through a mostly linear sequence of levels, fighting enemy Robo-Pirates, solving puzzles and collecting ''lums''. Collecting enough lums gains the player access to new parts of the world. Part of the lums are hidden in small cages, in which other freedom fighters or Teensies are imprisoned, and can be obtained by breaking the cages.

Rayman starts the game with minimal abilities, and he can gain more abilities as the game progresses. The main weapon available in the game is Rayman's fist, with which energy orbs can be shot. Eventually, the orbs can be charged before shooting them, making them more powerful. Rayman can also enter a strafing stance which allows him to easily aim orbs whilst avoiding enemy attacks. Rayman later gains the ability to swing over large gaps using Purple Lums. Rayman is also able to use his helicopter hair to slow his descent while jumping, with some segments later in the game allowing him to fly with his hair. There are also various items Rayman can use throughout the game, such as explosive barrels he can throw, giant plums he can ride on to carry him across dangerous surfaces, and rockets he must ride on to access new areas.

In addition to the main, story-based level sequence, there are also several levels in which the player can gain bonuses in a [[time trial]]. Additionally, by collecting all lums and breaking all cages in a level, the player unlocks a [[bonus level]] in which one of Globox's children races against a robot pirate. When the player controlling the child wins the race, Rayman gains health or a powerup.

== Versions ==
''Rayman 2'' was released on a wide variety of platforms, with several differences and name changes between the versions.

=== Nintendo 64 and Microsoft Windows ===
The Nintendo 64 version of ''Rayman 2: The Great Escape'' was released first{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, followed by a Microsoft Windows release later that year, with slight improvements to the Microsoft Windows version (including graphics and music).

On 26 May 2011, [[GOG.com]] re-released ''Rayman 2: The Great Escape'', alongside ''[[Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc]]'' and ''[[Rayman (video game)|Rayman Forever]]'', made to be compatible with Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7, along with a digital version of the game's soundtrack as bonus content. On 26 January 2012 [[Ubisoft]] announced that ''Rayman 2'' would be added as a bonus for [[pre-order|preordering]] the Microsoft Windows version of ''[[Rayman Origins]]''.&lt;ref name="RaymanTwitter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/RaymanGame/status/162582298213101568 |title=Rayman Twitter |accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dreamcast ===
The [[Dreamcast]] version has various changes from the original Nintendo 64 and Microsoft Windows versions, including several 2D sprites being replaced by 3D models, and a slightly zoomed-out camera angle. The Dreamcast version also has exclusive mini-games, playable by finding hidden crystals, and changes to the world map (the Dreamcast version uses The Isle of Doors instead of The Hall of Doors as the world map) and final battle. Many features in the Dreamcast version are retained in Rayman Revolution, such as the camera angle and the 3D models. This version has received the highest average reviews, winning 'IGN Dreamcast Game of the Year 2000', and a 9.6 score from IGN.

=== PlayStation ===
The PlayStation version was developed by [[Ubi Soft Shanghai]], and is the first version to have the characters speaking real languages (English, French, German, Spanish and Italian), replacing the gibberish spoken by the characters originally. Numerous level design changes were made, and some levels and cutscenes (namely the fake ending seen if the player accepts Jano's offer) were removed altogether. There are only 800 Yellow Lums in this version, nor is it decreased to 799 at any point as the scene with Razorbeard eating one of the Yellow Lums was changed so that he would eat a Red one instead, and as they're health pickups no matter which version of Rayman 2 you play, they have no total. Characters like the Ninjaws mini-boss that first appears at the end of The Sanctuary of Stone and Fire are exclusive to this version, and characters that did not have speaking roles before, such as the guardians Axel, Umber, and Foutch, now speak to Rayman when he confronts them.

This port was later released on the [[PlayStation Network]] on 18 December 2008 in North America and on 28 July 2010 in Europe.

=== PlayStation 2 ===
This version, titled ''Rayman: Revolution'' (''Rayman 2: Revolution'' in North America), was released on 22 December 2000. It features many enhancements including new minigames and bonus challenges, upgrades to Rayman's abilities, level revisions, new music tracks, the option to switch between the gibberish from other versions and newly recorded real language voices, three new bosses, and Yellow Lum redistribution. The Hall of Doors was replaced with three central hubs, called The Minisaurus Plain, Globox's House and The Rainbow Creek, in which to walk to each level freely, play Ly's bonus challenges unlocked by freeing Revolution-exclusive prisoners called Familiar Spirits, and purchase ability upgrades or the new minigames from the Teensies with the Yellow Lums the player has collected.

To date, Revolution is the only edition of ''Rayman 2'' that lets players save when a level has been only partially completed, but like all versions of the game, it still uses manual saves. This is also the only version in which the 1,000th Yellow Lum can be obtained normally, and hence actually changes the total back to 1,000 despite Razorbeard still eating it and the total changing to 999/999. The 1,000th Lum is obtained after beating Clark and receiving the Lumz Radar, a [[magnet]]-shaped gadget exclusive to Revolution that helps players track down any missed Yellow Lums.

However, despite the numerous improvements and enhancements to the gameplay, the frame rate is not as smooth as the near-constant 60fps of the Sega Dreamcast version,
and certain graphical effects from that version, such as the blue ring trails that accompany a fully charged gold fist orb, are also gone.

This port was later released on the PlayStation Network on 1 May 2012 in North America.

=== Game Boy Color ===
Titled ''Rayman 2 Forever'' (''Rayman 2'' in North America), this version was developed by [[Ubi Soft Milan]]. It is a 2D side scroller, and follows the story of the other versions. It was released in June 2001 in North America and December 2001 in Europe.
It has two identical boss fights. The second boss is Razorbeard, even though the sprite for a common Robo Pirate is used. Ly and Globox appear only in cutscenes. Like the PS1 version, Rayman has to collect 800 Lums instead of 1000.

=== Nintendo DS ===
The Nintendo 64 version of the game was ported to the Nintendo DS by [[DC Studios]] under the title ''Rayman DS'' on 24 March 2005. Very few changes have been made to the game from the Nintendo 64 version. Parts of some music tracks have been taken out and some graphical textures have been simplified, both likely due to storage limits on the Nintendo DS cartridge. The port also added touch screen controls.

=== iOS ===
Using the engine of ''Rayman 2'' for the Dreamcast, another port was released for Apple's iOS-based portable devices on 1 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5481455/dreamcasts-rayman-2-hits-iphone-next-week |title=Dreamcast's Rayman 2 Hits iPhone Next Week |work=Kotaku |accessdate=20 June 2015 |author=Brian Crecente}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features landscape touch-screen controls, with a figurative analogue stick on the left and two on-screen "buttons" on the right-hand side of the screen. The iOS game has since been removed from the App Store.

=== Nintendo 3DS ===
At a Nintendo event held in Europe on 19 January 2011, Ubisoft revealed several titles in development for Nintendo 3DS, which included a port of ''Rayman 2'' titled ''Rayman 3D'' to be released at the system's launch. Ubisoft confirmed that this version is a port of the Dreamcast version (and like the iOS version, the 3DS one also has no minigames nor the Globox Village) with "major updates on key gameplay elements such as accessibility, progression and learning curve." With this release, versions of ''Rayman 2'' have been launch titles for two Nintendo handheld consoles.

== Development ==
''Rayman 2'' was originally conceptualised as a sidescrolling 2D [[platform game|platformer]], like [[Rayman (video game)|the first game]].&lt;ref name="NGen18"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Rayman 2 |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=18|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=June 1996|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sega Saturn Magazine"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Coming Soon: Rayman 2|journal=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|publisher=[[EMAP]]|date=August 1996|issue=10|page=15|url=https://archive.org/details/Official_Sega_Saturn_Magazine_010|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development on the prototype began in early 1996 and was slated to be released on the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], and Microsoft Windows in the fourth quarter of that year.&lt;ref name="NGen18"/&gt; The prototype of ''Rayman 2'' featured some usage of 3D models on a 2D background, differing from the [[16-bit]] presentation of its predecessor.&lt;ref name="Sega Saturn Magazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="frenchprev"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rayman 2 prototype - Mega Force|journal=Mega Force|date=April 1996|issue=9|page=28|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prototype is playable in the final PlayStation version of the game if the player completes a certain percentage of the game.

''Rayman 2'' received acclaim from both critics and fans, scoring a 9 on Nintendo 64, 9.2 on Microsoft Windows and PlayStation and 9.6 on Dreamcast from IGN. It also received 'IGN Dreamcast Game of the Year 2000'. It was praised in most aspects including gameplay, audio, graphics and controls, praising the colourful, vibrant worlds, the soundtrack, and the varied gameplay. IGN's Brandon Justice called it "the most impressive feat of game design and execution the platforming genre has ever seen."&lt;ref name="gamespot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt;

The reception for ''Rayman DS'' was mixed, citing graphical flaws and camera problems,&lt;ref name="gamespot-ds"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rayman-ds-review/1900-6121182/ |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=20 June 2015 |title=Rayman DS Review |author=Frank Provo}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it did support controlling the game via the touchpad, this was regarded as sloppy and awkward,&lt;ref name="ign-ds"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ign.com/articles/2005/03/23/rayman-ds |accessdate=20 June 2015 |work=[[IGN]] |title=Rayman DS Review |author=Craig Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; partly caused by the game being a direct port of the Nintendo 64 version.&lt;ref name="gamespot-ds" /&gt; ''Rayman 3D'' got a similarly mixed reception due to it being a direct port of the Dreamcast release, with no true usage of the 3DS's capabilities except for stereoscopic 3D.

The eighth and final season of the American [[Animated series|animated comedy television series]] ''[[Regular Show]]'', created by [[J. G. Quintel]], originally aired on [[Cartoon Network]] in the United States. Quintel originally created the series' pilot using characters from his comedy shorts for the cancelled anthology series ''The Cartoonstitute''. He developed ''Regular Show'' from his own experiences in college, while several of its main characters originated from his animated shorts ''The Naïve Man from Lolliland'' and ''2 in the AM PM''. He himself voice acts one of the main characters in the show, "Mordecai", a [[blue jay]]. It was announced on July 7, 2015 and aired from September 26, 2016 to January 16, 2017. The season was branded under the title ''Regular Show in Space''.

The episode "The Ice Tape" features the final voice performance of [[David Ogden Stiers]] as he died on March 3, 2018 which was 15 months after the episode aired.

Mordecai and Rigby are forced to jump between the two factions after time resets.&lt;br&gt;{{•}} "'''The Power'''" (part 3) -  Mordecai and Rigby relive the first episode, but soon realize that they need to help Pops so they use the Power to go back. Pops realizes that he must reach out to Anti-Pops and finally saves the universe at the cost of his life. The entire park crew return home to their friends and family. After erecting a memorial statue of Pops, a montage shows what happened to the park crew after their adventure in space: Mordecai quits his job at the park, becomes a painter, and meets a woman [a female bat] he doesn't feel awkward around (though it's implied he never reunites with Margaret or CJ, he does use their likenesses in his art); Rigby marries and has children with Eileen; Muscle Man and Starla move into a nicer trailer and have more children; Benson reunites with Pam the scientist, the two raise four cats and a pig, and Benson becomes park owner after Mr. Maellard's death (and trains a new batch of workers who look similar to the ones he had before); High Five Ghost reunites with his human girlfriend, Celia, and the two become popular party DJs in Prague; and Skips is still single and still working at the park, only now, he wears shorts instead of jeans. 25 years later, the entire crew return and Mordecai and Rigby reflect on Pops' sacrifice and how immature they used to be before deciding to play some old arcade games. The scene pans out with Pops watching his friends' lives from Heaven. He ejects a VHS tape labeled "Regular Show". He says "Jolly good show" for one last time and the series concludes. &lt;br&gt;'''Song''': "[["Heroes" (David Bowie song)|'Heroes']]" by [[David Bowie]]

His special interests are thematic [[symbolic anthropology]], [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]], [[vernacular architecture]], and [[social change]] among [[minority group|ethnic minorities]].  He has lectured and written about diversity and commonality amongst the inhabitants of the islands off the coast of [[West Sumatra]].&lt;ref name="EuroSEAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroseas.org/platform/en/content/the-3rd-euroseas-conference|title=The 3rd EuroSEAS Conference|date=6–8 September 2001|publisher=School of Oriental &amp; African Studies, University of Londo|accessdate=30 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616033409/http://www.euroseas.org/platform/en/content/the-3rd-euroseas-conference|archivedate=16 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
He is the son of the [[Classics|classical]] [[archaeologist]] [[Karl Schefold]], who was Professor of Archaeology at the [[University of Basel]].  His mother was Marianne (née von den Steinen) Schefold.&lt;ref name="Versuch "&gt;{{cite book|last=Schefold|first=Reimar |title=Versuch einer Stilanalyse der Aufhängehaken vom Mittleren Sepik in Neu-Guinea: Auch erschienen als Bd. |series=Basler Beiträge zur Ethnologie|volume=4|year=1966|publisher=Pharos-Verlag|language=Dutch|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reimar received his Ph.D. from the University of Basel.&lt;ref name="Threesources" /&gt;

==Career==
His career has included several [[Field study|field studies]] of Indonesian communities in the [[Mentawai Islands]]. In this regard, he has researched the Mentawaians' culinary code in the Puliaijat ritual,&lt;ref&gt;Schefold, R. (1982). ''The culinary code in the Puliaijat ritual of the Mentawaians''. Igitur.&lt;/ref&gt; and the anthropocentric origin myths of the Mentawaians.&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wagner|first=Wilfried |title=Mentawai: Identität im Wandel auf indonesischen Ausseninseln|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dEdAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+origins+of+the+woman+on+the+raft+:+on+the+prehistory+of+the+Mentawaians&amp;dq=The+origins+of+the+woman+on+the+raft+:+on+the+prehistory+of+the+Mentawaians&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=B8XNTP_2Lou0sAPSj7nWDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA|year=1999|publisher=Übersee-Museum|isbn=3-88299-059-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least four of his other published works have also involved the people of Siberut, including religious conceptions,&lt;ref&gt;Schefold, R.

One of his areas of specialization is vernacular architecture; with several hundred ethnic groups in Indonesia, Schefold researched their extreme variety, fundamental similarities, as well as their creative adaptation to regional circumstances and social changes.&lt;ref name="greenhomebuilding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenhomebuilding.com/asia.htm|title=Asia|work=greenhomebuilding.com|accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World]]'', Schefold describes how [[Mali]]'s [[Dogon people]] use complex esoteric [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] symbolism, associating parts of the human body with their homes.&lt;ref name="Shahshahani"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shahshahani|first=Soheila |title=Body as medium of meaning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXmszKFQ7MUC&amp;pg=PA34|year=2004|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=3-8258-7154-1|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of Schefold's books titled the "Indonesian Houses: Tradition and transformation in vernacular architecture, Volume 1", he deals elaborately with the traditional houses of Indonesians, particularly the [[Siberut]] people.&lt;ref name= Schefold&gt;{{Cite book|last= Schefold|first= Reimar |author2=P.

While Schefold has authored and co-authored numerous books, ''Framing Indonesian Realities: Essays in Symbolic Anthropology in Honour of Reimar Schefold'' is a 2004 compilation of essays written by others that touch upon the subjects Schefold worked on for 35 years amongst the various [[cultural group]]s of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paperbackswap.com/Framing-Indonesian-Realities-Essays-Symbolic/book/9067182184/|title=Framing Indonesian Realities: Essays in Symbolic Anthropology in Honour of Reimar Schefold|date=May 2004|work=paperbackswap.com|publisher=Canadian Museum of Civilization/Musee Canadie|accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reverse chronology''' is a method of story-telling whereby the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is revealed in reverse order.

In a story employing this technique, the first [[Scene (fiction)|scene]] shown is actually the conclusion to the plot. Once that scene ends, the penultimate scene is shown, and so on, so that the final scene the viewer sees is the first chronologically.

Many stories employ [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], showing prior events, but whereas the scene order of most conventional films is A-B-C-etc., a film in reverse chronology goes Z-Y-X-etc.

As a hypothetical example, if the [[fairy tale]] ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' was told using reverse chronology, the opening scene would depict Jack chopping the beanstalk down and killing the giant. The next scene would feature Jack being discovered by the giant and climbing down the beanstalk in fear of his life. Later, we would see Jack running into the man with the infamous magic beans, then, at the end of the film, being sent off by his mother to sell the cow.

== Purpose ==
The unusual nature of this method means it is only used in stories of a specific nature. For example, ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' features a man with [[anterograde amnesia]], meaning he is unable to form new memories. The film parallels the protagonist's perspective by unfolding in reverse chronological order, leaving the audience as ignorant of the events that occurred prior to each scene (which, played in reverse chronological order, will not be revealed until later) as the protagonist is.

In the film ''[[Irréversible]],'' an act of [[homicide|homicidal]] violence takes place at the start of the movie (i. e., it is the final event to take place). During the remainder of the film we learn not only that the violence is an act of vengeance, but what exactly is being avenged. The film was highly controversial for its graphic nature; had the scenes been shown in chronological order, this violent content would make it a simple, and pointlessly brutal, revenge movie. However, as it is, told in reverse, the audience is made to consider the exact consequences of each action, and there is often "more than meets the eye."

== Examples of use ==

=== Literature ===
The epic poem ''[[Aeneid]]'', written by [[Virgil]] in the 1st century BC, uses reverse chronology within scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Michael von; &amp; Schmeling, Gareth L. (1997). '' History of Roman Literature: From Livius Andronicus to Boethius, Vol. 1''. Brill. p. 681. {{ISBN|90-04-09630-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[The Three Apples]]", a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', the middle part of the story shows a flashback of events leading up to the discovery of a dead body at the beginning of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–94|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of [[W. R. Burnett]]'s novel, ''Goodbye to the Past'' (1934), moves continually from 1929 to 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, David (April 2006). ''The Way Hollywood Tells It: Story and Style in Modern Movies''. [[University of California Press]]. p. 91. {{ISBN|0-520-24622-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Long View'' (1956) by [[Elizabeth Jane Howard]] describes a marriage in reverse chronology from 1950s London back to its beginning in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/30/hilary-mantel-elizabeth-jane-howard-novelist Hilary Mantel in The Guardian, 30 January 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Lewis Wallant]] uses flashbacks in reverse chronology in ''The Human Season'' (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Serafin, Steven; &amp; Bendixen, Alfred (2003). ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature''. [[Continuum International Publishing Group]].  p. 1189. {{ISBN|0-8264-1517-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel ''Christopher Homm'' (1965), by [[C. H. Sisson]], is also told in reverse chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Head, Dominic (2006). ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. p. 1036. {{ISBN|0-521-83179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip K. Dick]], in his 1967 novel ''[[Counter-Clock World]]'', describes a future in which time has started to move in reverse, resulting in the dead reviving in their own graves ("old-birth"), living their lives in reverse, eventually ending in returning to the womb, and splitting into an egg and a sperm during copulation between a recipient woman and a man. The novel was expanded from Dick's short story "Your Appointment Will Be Yesterday", first published in the August 1966 edition of [[Amazing Stories]].

[[Martin Amis]]'s 1991 novel ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]'' tells the story of a man who, it seems, brings dead people to life. Eventually it is revealed that the story is being seen backwards, and he was a doctor at [[Auschwitz]] who brought death to live people. He escaped to the United States, and the novel starts with his death and ends with his birth. Amis writes in the Afterword that he had a "certain paragraph" from [[Kurt Vonnegut|Kurt Vonnegut's]] ''[[Slaughterhouse Five]]'' (1969) in mind.  As he waits to be taken by aliens to the planet Tralfamadore, the protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, watches a war movie backwards. American planes full of holes fly backwards as German planes suck bullets from them; bombers take their bombs back to base where they are returned to the States, reduced to ore and buried. The American fliers became high school kids again, and, Billy guesses, Hitler ultimately returns to babyhood.

[[Iain M. Banks|Iain Banks]]'s novel ''[[Use of Weapons]]'' interweaves two parallel stories, one told in standard chronology and one in reverse, both concluding at a critical moment in the main character's life.

[[Julia Alvarez]]'s novel ''[[How the García Girls Lost Their Accents]]'' opens in 1989 with one of the characters returning to her native Dominican Republic. The story of why the family left and their attempts to succeed in New York are told in reverse chronological order, with the last events happening in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arls.org/2011/11/arls-teen-book-review-how-the-garcia-girls-lost-their-accents/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theatre ===
A number of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] have employed this technique. [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Moss Hart|Moss Hart's]] 1934 play, ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (play)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', is told in reverse order, as is the [[Harold Pinter]] play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' (1978). Kaufman and Hart's play was adapted as [[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|a musical comedy by Stephen Sondheim]] in 1981, and Pinter's play was made into [[Betrayal (1983 film)|a film]] in 1983.

=== Film ===
In 1927, [[Jean Epstein]]'s ''La glace à trois faces'' (''The Three Sided Mirror'') features a sequence where the events happen in reverse, beginning with the protagonist's exit from a room until the viewer sees the entrance. The Czech comedy ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' (1966) is a farce which starts with a guillotined man finding his head popped back on his shoulders and ends with him as a new-born being pushed back into his mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,841358,00.html | work=Time | title=Cinema: Happy End | date=1968-06-28 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atom Egoyan]], influenced by Pinter's plays, tells the story of ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]'' (1997) in reverse chronology, with the first scene of the film set in 1977 and the last in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;MacDermott, Felim; &amp; McGrath, Declan (2003). ''Screenwriting''. [[Focal Press]]. p. 172. {{ISBN|0-240-80512-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique was later employed in ''[[Peppermint Candy]]'' (2000), by [[South Korea]]n director [[Lee Chang-dong]]; in ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2000), a mystery directed by [[Christopher Nolan]] about short term memory loss; and in [[Jean-Luc Godard|Jean-Luc Godard's]] short film ''De l'origine du XXIe siècle pour moi'' (2000).&lt;ref name="Gateward"&gt;Gateward, Frances K. (2007). ''Seoul Searching: Culture and Identity in Contemporary Korean Cinema''. [[SUNY Press]]. p. 136. {{ISBN|0-7914-7225-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Irréversible]]'' (2002), the technique is used so thoroughly that the [[Closing credits|end credits]] are not only shown at the beginning of the movie, but they roll ''down'' the screen, rather than upwards as is familiar.

The first several scenes in 2003's film ''[[Identity (film)|Identity]]'', starring [[John Cusack]], occur in reverse order.

The 2004 film ''[[5x2]]'', directed by [[François Ozon]], tells the story of a relationship between two people in five episodes using reverse chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=313595 | work=The New York Times | first=A. O. | last=Scott | accessdate=2010-05-22 | title=We're Sorry | date=2005-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004), a main substory is told in reverse.

''Coup de Sang'', a French film by Jean Marboeuf (2006), uses limited reverse chronology. The film begins with the revelation that the main character will commit a murder one week from the next scene, although it is not revealed who will be killed or why.

In the 2007 movie ''[[P.S. I Love You (film)|P.S. I Love You]]'', the scenes in which Gerry Kennedy ([[Gerard Butler]]) meets and courts Holly ([[Hilary Swank]]) are shown in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/P-S-I-Love-You-2797.html |author= Calamari, Alexandra |date= 2007 |title= ''P.S. I Love You'' |publisher= Cinema Blend |accessdate= July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 Tamil movie, ''[[Manmadan Ambu (film)|Manmadan Ambu]]'', the song "Neela Vaanam" (visuals inspired by [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]") is shown in a reverse sequence.

=== Television ===
{{See also|The Backwards Episode}}

The made-for-television drama ''[[Two Friends (1986 film)|''Two Friends'']]'' (1986), by [[Jane Campion]], and the 1997 episode, "[[The Betrayal]]", of the hit sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', employs the technique. The ''Seinfeld'' episode is a take-off of the Harold Pinter play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' and has a character named "Pinter."&lt;ref name="Gateward"/&gt;  [[Redrum (The X-Files)|"Redrum"]], a 2000 episode of ''[[The X-Files]],'' uses the technique in focusing on a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The 2002 ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' episode "Hindsight" uses reverse chronology to illustrate the events leading to traumatic car accident. A 1997 [[Star Trek: Voyager|''Star Trek: Voyager'']] episode, "[[Before and After (Star Trek: Voyager)|Before and After]]", which writer Kenneth Biller claimed was based on a [[Martin Amis]] novel [[Time's Arrow (novel)|''Time's Arrow'']], also features a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The [[Sealab 2021|''Sealab 2021'']] episode "Shrabster" is also in reverse order. For a few seasons, the revived [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] had an extensive storyline focusing on a relationship between the Doctor and his companions' daughter (River Song) from the future based on "opposite timelines" (i.e., as the Doctor was travelling through time on one path, River was travelling on an opposite path) causing them to interact in opposite chronological order. In 2017, the British tv mini-series ''Rellik'' (Killer backwards) tells a story about a serial killer in backwards order. In 2018, the episode "[[Once Removed]]", from the series [[Inside No. 9|''Inside No. 9'']] uses reverse chronology to tell a dark story about a family who is moving house, and the murder that subsequently begins. Also from 2018, the second installment of the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] anthology series ''[[American Crime Story]]'' focuses on [[The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story|the assassination of designer Gianni Versace]], employing reverse chronology through the course of several episodes to explore the background of Versace's killer Andrew Cunanan.

=== Comics ===
The story "The Time Eater" from issue 40 of the comic "[[Vampirella]]", scripted by Jack Butterworth and published in 1975, included the concept of human lives running backwards. People were shown to be exhumed, reunited with families, separated from their spouses in order to attend school, and finally returned to the womb. Dialogue was reversed also. [[Alan Moore]]'s 1983 short story "The Reversible Man" from issue 308 of the comic "[[2000 AD (comics)|2000AD]]" told an ordinary man's life backwards, using the same concept as Butterworth but recasting it as a first-person narrative. [[Brian K. Vaughan]] wrote an issue of the ongoing [[Midnighter]] series told in reverse chronology.  The issue explored the fact that the character Midnighter has the ability to calculate millions of possible scenarios for any given situation.  The issue does not have the scenes in reverse order, but rather the individual pages run backwards.

Issue 43 of Bongo's "[[Simpsons Comics]]" is told in reverse order: the story opens with a depiction of a crane lifting a crashed car out of a lake; each subsequent scene (which lasts for one page) carries a caption informing the reader that it took place, for instance, "20 minutes earlier". The penultimate page jumps back thirty years and shows [[Homer Simpson]] as a child

=== Anime ===
The 2007 anime television series ''[[Touka Gettan]]'' employed entirely this narrative method. All 26 episodes were aired in chronologically reverse order, with the first episode being the ending of the story while the last episode being the beginning.

=== Music ===
The lyrics to "[[All Along the Watchtower#Background|All Along the Watchtower]]", written by [[Bob Dylan]], are, he says, "in a rather reverse order"; indeed, the final verse begins with the words "All along the watchtower", and if reversed, the [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]s would tell the story in the correct order.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The lyrics to "Apparition. Apparitions." by [[Trophy Scars]] describe the events leading up to a woman's suicide in reverse order, beginning with her death and ending with her initial romance with her boyfriend.

The song "One Thing Leads to Another" by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] (on a limited release of their 1993 album ''[[Very (Pet Shop Boys album)|Very]]'') describes the events leading up to a man's death in reverse order.

Multiple music videos, including [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]" use reverse chronology in which a scene plays backwards while someone sings normally. This is done by filming the video chronologically but getting the actor to sing the lyrics backwards. The music video for Enigma's "Return to Innocence" uses reverse chronology showing a man's life, beginning with his death as an old man and ending with his baptism as an infant. The music video for [[Linkin Park]]'s "Bleed It Out" also uses the same method, whereas the band performs normally, but everything else is reversed. In 2016, Malaysian Singer-Songwriter Yuna uses reverse chronology in her music video "Lanes".

The events of the song "Reverse" by [[SomeKindaWonderful]], as said in the title itself, are told in reverse chronology.

The lyrics in "Rewind" by NaS also tell a story in reverse chronology, with some of the dialogue even being in reverse order.

"Good Mistake" Album by [[Bahram Nouraei]] is the first Iranian concept album ever made inspired by reverse chronology as the storytelling method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahramnouraei.com/about#/|title=Bahram Nouraei&amp;nbsp;— Official Website|website=bahramnouraei.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been several discussions as to how the picturisation of Neela Vaanam "Manmadan Ambu" (sung by Kamal Haasan himself) has been slightly inspired from official video of Coldplay's The Scientist. The whole song has been depicted in such a way so as to highlight the events that led to the death of Mannar's (Kamal's character) French wife Juliet, in reverse.

=== Video game ===
The [[Dead Island announcement trailer|announcement trailer]] of 2011 video game, ''[[Dead Island]]'', also present in reverse chronological order with flash of chronological action edited into the whole video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZqrG1bdGtg|title=Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer|website=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{citations needed|date=July 2013}}
[[File:Safari Tanzania.jpg|thumb|right|Tourists in safari vehicles in the [[w:Ngorongoro Conservation Area|Ngorongoro crater]]]]
A '''safari''' {{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|f|ɑr|i}} ({{Lang-ar|سَفَارِي}}) is an overland journey, usually a trip by [[tourist]]s in [[Africa]]. In the past, the trip was often a [[Big-game hunting|big-game hunt]], but today, safaris are often to observe and [[Wildlife photography|photograph wildlife]]—or hiking and sightseeing, as well.

==Etymology==
[[File:Safari-jam-in-Maasai-Mara.JPG|350px|right|thumb|Lion-watching during a safari in the Maasai Mara]]
[[File:Serengeti Safari with Leopard.jpg|upright|thumb|A safari in the [[Serengeti National Park]]; Tourists go right under a roadside tree on which a leopard is resting]]
[[File:KrugerNightSafari.jpg|thumb|right|A night drive in the [[Kruger National Park]] in South Africa]]
The [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word ''safari'' means ''journey,'' originally from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] سفر (safar) meaning ''a journey'';&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hans Wehr]] Arabic-English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; the verb for "to travel" in Swahili is ''kusafiri''. These words are used for any type of journey, e.g. by bus from [[Nairobi]] to [[Mombasa]] or by ferry from [[Dar es Salaam]] to [[Unguja]]. ''Safari'' entered the English language at the end of the 1850s thanks to explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = safari | url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/169670?rskey=BnRdiF&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid | website = [[oed.com]] | accessdate = 2 December 2014 }}&lt;br&gt;See also: {{Cite web | title = ''safari'' in English corpus, 1800–2000 | url = https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=safari&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=0 | website = [[Google Ngram Viewer]] | accessdate = 2 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Regimental March of the [[King's African Rifles]] was 'Funga Safari', literally 'set out on a journey', or, in other words, pack up equipment ready for travel. 

{{Quote|
''Funga safari, funga safari.''
''Funga safari, funga safari.''
''Amri ya nani? Amri ya nani?''
''Amri ya Bwana Kapteni,''
''Amri ya KAR.''
}}

Which is, in English:

{{Quote|
Set out on a journey,
Set out on a journey. 
On whose orders? On whose orders?
On the order of the boss captain,
On the order of the KAR.
}}

On Kenya's independence from Britain, Funga Safari was retained as the Regimental March of the Kenya Rifles, successor to the K.A.R.

==History==
In 1836 [[William Cornwallis Harris]] led an expedition purely to observe and record wildlife and landscapes by the expedition's members. Harris established the safari style of journey, starting with a not too strenuous rising at first light, an energetic day walking, an afternoon rest then concluding with a formal dinner and telling stories in the evening over drinks and tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;pp.6-7 Balfour, Daryl &amp;  Balfour, Sharna ''Simply Safari'' Struik, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The hunting aspect traditionally associated with the safari is said to have its origins in the early 1800s in the region of [[Évora]], [[Alentejo]], where villagers got together to hunt wild [[boar]] and reclaim land for farming. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Literary genre==
[[Jules Verne]]'s first novel ''[[Five Weeks in a Balloon]]'' published in 1863 and [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s first novel ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' published in 1885, both describe journeys of English travellers on Safari and were best sellers in their day. These two books gave rise to a genre of Safari adventure novels and films.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

[[Ernest Hemingway]] wrote several fiction and non-fiction pieces about African safaris. His short stories "[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]" and "[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (short story)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]" are set on African safaris and were written after Hemingway's own experience on safari.  His books ''[[Green Hills of Africa]]'' and ''[[True at First Light]]'' are both set on African safaris.

==Cinematic genre==
The safari provided countless hours of cinema entertainment in sound films from ''[[Trader Horn (1931 film)|Trader Horn]]'' (1931) onwards. The safari was used in many adventure films such as the [[Tarzan]], [[Jungle Jim]], and [[Bomba the Jungle Boy]] [[film series]] up to ''[[The Naked Prey]]'' (1965) where [[Cornel Wilde]], a [[white hunter]], becomes game himself. The safari genre films were parodied in the [[Bob Hope]] comedies ''[[Road to Zanzibar]]'' and ''[[Call Me Bwana]]''. A short 15-minute [[helicopter]] safari was shown in ''[[Africa Addio]]'' where clients are armed, flown from their hotel and landed in front of an unlucky and baffled [[elephant]]. ''[[Out of Africa]]'' has [[Karen Blixen]] and famous hunter [[Denys Finch Hatton]] travelling, with Denys refusing to abandon home comforts using fine china and crystal and listening to Mozart recordings over the gramophone while on safari trip.

==Fashion==
There is a certain theme or style associated with the word, which includes [[khaki]] clothing, belted [[bush jacket]]s, [[pith helmet]]s or [[slouch hat]]s, and animal skin patterns. The term ''safari chic'' arose after the release of the film ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;p.175 Bickford-Smith, Vivian &amp;  Mendelsohn, Richard ''Black and White in Colour: African History on Screen James Currey Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; This not only included clothing but also interior design and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, Bibi Jordan ''Safari Chic: Wild Exteriors and Polished Interiors of Africa''
Smith Publisher, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Sheng''''' ({{zh|c=生|p=Shēng|l=scholar}}) is the main male role in [[Chinese opera]]. This role has numerous subtypes. The {{transl|zh|''laosheng''}} is a dignified older role.

The only two {{transl|zh|''hongsheng''}} roles are [[Guan Gong]], the Chinese god of sworn brotherhood, loyalty and righteousness, and [[Emperor Taizu of Song|Zhao Kuang-yin]], the first [[Song Dynasty]] emperor. Young male characters are known as {{transl|zh|''xiaosheng''}}. These characters sing in a high, shrill voice with occasional breaks to represent the voice changing period of adolescence.

'''Svrzo's House''' is an old house in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] that was established when the [[Ottoman Empire]] ruled the area. It is a branch of the [[Museum of Sarajevo]]. It is typical in that it has living quarters for the men, the women, and the servants.
The house is in extremely well preserved condition, which is noteworthy in that the house is built completely from wood; a construction method not commonly used in the region in modern times. It is open to the public for self-guided tours and has brochures and information in multiple languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1872">A '''taboret''' (also spelled '''tabouret or tabourette''') or '''stool''' refers to two different pieces of furniture: a cabinet or a stool.

The popular sense refers to a small portable stand or cabinet, with drawers and shelves for storage.  It is used as a method to bring organization to a work area.  This name for a portable cabinet is common to artists.  However, in the context of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], a taboret is a stand for a plant or a beverage.

As a stool, it refers to a short stool without a back or arms.  The name is derived from its resemblance to a drum (diminutive of Old French ''tabour'').&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|tabouret}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A highly prized stool==
[[File:Tabouret.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Empire style]] tabourets in the [[Château de Fontainebleau]]]]
The tabouret acquired a more specialized meaning in 17th century [[France]] at the court of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in Versailles. Sitting in the presence of the royal family was a much coveted honor, and the tabouret was the way to do it.  The court tabouret was an elaborate, upholstered stool with curved wooden legs and tassels, carried by a liveried and wigged servant. [[Duchesses]] were automatically granted the honor of sitting in front of the queen.  In fact, this stool became such a symbol of privilege that when Louis XIV's mother, the Regent [[Anne of Austria]], granted the tabouret to two non-duchesses, such a storm of protest was raised that she had to revoke the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Herman | first = Eleanor | title = Sex with Kings | location = New York | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-06-058543-9 | pages = 140-141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{National anthems of Georgia}}
'''''Tavisupleba''''' ({{lang-ka|თავისუფლება}}, {{IPA-ka|tʰɑwisupʰlɛbɑ|pron}}; "Freedom") is the [[national anthem]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. It was adopted as the Georgian national anthem in May 2004, along with the new national [[Flag of Georgia (country)|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Georgia (country)|coat of arms]]. The symbols' change was brought about upon the successful overthrow of the previous government in the bloodless [[Rose Revolution]]. The music, taken from the Georgian operas ''[[Abesalom da Eteri]]'' ("Abesalom and Eteri") and ''Daisi'' ("The Nightfall"), by the Georgian composer [[Zacharia Paliashvili]] ({{lang-ka|ზაქარია ფალიაშვილი}}), was adapted to form it by [[Ioseb Kechakmadze]] ({{lang-ka|იოსებ კეჭაყმაძე}}). The lyrics were composed by [[David Magradze]] ({{lang-ka|დავით მაღრაძე}}).

== History ==
The current Georgian national anthem was adopted by the [[Parliament of Georgia]] on 20 May 2004,&lt;ref&gt;Parliament of Georgia. The Constitutional Law on the National Anthem of Georgia ([http://www.parliament.ge/index.php?lang_id=GEO&amp;sec_id=69&amp;kan_det=det&amp;kan_id=3 No 72-2s]; საქართველოს ორგანული კანონი "საქართველოს სახელმწიფო ჰიმნის შესახებ"). Retrieved April 4, 2006 .&lt;/ref&gt; exactly 5 months after the resignation of President [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] in the [[Rose Revolution]]. A bill was introduced in the first plenary meeting of the 6th convocation of the Georgian Parliament on April 22, 2004. The bill to adopt "Tavisupleba" as Georgia's national anthem was presented by the Minister of Culture [[Giorgi Gabashvili (politician)|Giorgi Gabashvili]]; in which the music was played for the deputies soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Parliament of Georgia [http://intranet.parliament.ge/newsletter/english/2004/27.04.2004/pr_rel_1.htm The First Plenary Meeting of Parliament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930024451/http://intranet.parliament.ge/newsletter/english/2004/27.04.2004/pr_rel_1.htm |date=2007-09-30 }}. April 22, 2004. Retrieved April 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The law does not give any regulations, but refers to the corresponding Presidential Decree.

"Tavisupleba" succeeded the old national anthem "[[Dideba|Dideba zetsit kurtheuls]]", which was in use by the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] from 1918 to 1921, and again by the newly independent (from the Soviet Union) Georgia from 1990 to 2004.

The new national anthem quickly gained popularity in contrast to its predecessor, whose lyrics were somewhat archaic and difficult to memorize.

During [[United States|U.S.]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s visit to Georgia, on May 10, 2005, when he along with [[President of Georgia|President]] [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] was addressing tens of thousands of Georgians in [[Freedom Square, Tbilisi|Freedom Square]] in [[Tbilisi]], a recording of "Tavisupleba" failed to play properly. Saakashvili then motioned to the choirs, and thousands in the crowd joined the singers in singing it, a moment which was described by media as "the most powerful moment of the day".&lt;ref&gt;''The [[Washington Times]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20050514070405/http://www.washtimes.com:80/national/20050511-121124-2665r.htm "Bush praises Georgians", by Joseph Curl]. May 11, 2005. Retrieved April 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==
The music of "Tavisupleba" was adapted from two Georgian operas, ''[[Abesalom da Eteri]]'' (1918) and ''[[Daisi]]'' (1923), composed by [[Zacharia Paliashvili]], the father of the Georgian [[European classical music|classical music]] genre.

The '''Croc Festival''' is an [[Australia]]n event held annually in a number of locations in remote and rural areas and is produced by Indigenous Festivals of Australia. It engages [[Indigenous Australians]] and non-Indigenous Australians with the aim of building partnerships and celebrating youth and traditional culture. Over three fun days, primary and high school students participate in activities related to arts, education, health, careers, sports, health and [[ethnic relations|reconciliation]]. In the evenings students stage non-competitive school dance performances under the stars.

==History==
Croc Festival was created in 1998 after the former [[Queensland]] Minister for Health, [[Mike Horan]], asked the producers of the [[Rock Eisteddfod Challenge]] to find a way to get more [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous students]] to attend school. 

The inaugural Croc Festival in [[Weipa]] (far-north Queensland) in July 1998 attracted 350 students from 17 schools in [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] and [[Torres Strait]]. It was opened by the then [[Governor-General]], [[Sir William Deane]], who observed that the event was "reconciliation in action". In 2007 Croc Festival is expected to attract almost 20,000 students from 450 schools with a national audience of about 60,000 people.

Croc Festival is 100% drug, alcohol and tobacco free. According to research and reports by teachers, outcomes for students include improved [[self-esteem]] and teamwork, improved [[Toleration|tolerance]] of other students, awareness of personal health issues such as [[nutrition]] and [[mental health]], and knowledge of the dangers of drugs, alcohol and tobacco. Further outcomes include increased rates of school attendance, improved [[literacy]], numeracy and [[Public speaking|oratorical]] skills, and better goal setting for the future.

Croc Festival in 2007 will be held on [[Thursday Island]] in Queensland, [[Derby]] and [[Mullewa]] in Western Australia, [[Alice Springs]] in the Northern Territory, [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]] in South Australia, [[Kempsey, New South Wales|Kempsey]] and [[Dubbo]] in New South Wales, and [[Shepparton]] in Victoria. Students travel by road, air and sea to reach the venues, often camping in tents at Croc Village during the three-day festival.

The not-for-profit Croc Festival is supported by community businesses, local, state and federal government funding, corporate and philanthropic sponsorship, and in-kind support. Croc Festival and the [[Rock Eisteddfod Challenge]] are part of the [[Global rock challenge|Global Rock Challenge]] family which engages youth in seven countries around the world.

The Croc Festival was cancelled in 2008 due to a Federal funding cut.

The '''Time of Troubles''', also known as the '''Arrival''', '''Godswar''', and '''Avatar Crisis''', is a fictional time period in the chronology of the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' [[campaign setting]]&lt;ref name="FRCS" /&gt; of the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' fantasy role playing game.  Taking place during the Year of Shadows, 1358 [[Dalereckoning|DR]], the Time of Troubles was a cataclysmic period during which the [[deity|gods]] of [[Faerûn]] were forced to walk the earth in their mortal [[Incarnation|avatar]] forms. However, unlike when a god usually sends an avatar and its true form resides usually on one of the Outer Planes, the gods were all demoted and this was the only form they had at the time, making them very vulnerable. Several major deities died during the Time of Troubles, and a handful of mortals rose to [[divinity]].&lt;ref name="FRCS" /&gt;

==Summary==

On the fictional world of [[Abeir-Toril|Toril]], the planet on which the Dungeons and Dragons fantasy setting The Forgotten Realms is based, The Time of Troubles was precipitated by an attempt by two of the settings' deities, the gods [[Bane (Forgotten Realms)|Bane]] and [[Myrkul]], to steal the Tablets of Fate from the overgod [[Lord Ao|Ao]]. The tablets were created by Ao and delineated the areas of responsibilities given to each deity: his or her "portfolio" over which each of the gods of the [[Forgotten Realms]] have domain. Angry with the gods for their habitual pursuit of power and negligence toward their mortal faithful, the theft of the Tablets resulted in Ao banishing all of the gods save [[Helm (Forgotten Realms)|Helm]] (selected to protect the gates to the heavens) to take on avatars and live as mortals on Toril. The novels covering this event and subsequent game products take place almost exclusively on the western continent of Faerûn. 

The immediate effects of this banishment were threefold. First, [[Magic of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|divine magic]] (spells granted to [[Cleric (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|clerics]] by their patron deities) ceased to function altogether&lt;ref name="Siege"&gt;''[[Siege of Darkness]]'', [[R.A. Salvatore]], TSR, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; unless the cleric was within one mile of their deity's avatar.  Second, [[Magic of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|arcane magic]] (a force channeled from [[The Weave]] by [[Wizard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|wizards]] and [[Sorcerer (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|sorcerers]]) ceased to be regulated by its steward, [[Mystra (Forgotten Realms)|Mystra]], and became dangerously unpredictable.&lt;ref name="Siege"/&gt;  Third, the characteristically immortal and aloof deities were now vulnerable (though devastatingly powerful) and dwelling among the civilizations of [[Faerûn]].&lt;ref name="Siege"/&gt;

The Time of Troubles coincided with the release of the second edition of the ''[[Dungeons and Dragons|Advanced Dungeons and Dragons]]''  game, and events in the story reflected changes in the game rules.&lt;ref name="Roundtable"&gt;[http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/fr/20010221 Forgotten Realms: Realms Roundtable] at Wizards of the Coast.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the demise of the assassin cults in Faerûn reflected the fact that the [[Assassin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|assassin]] [[player character]] class was discontinued in ''AD&amp;D Second Edition''.&lt;ref name="FaithsNAvatars" /&gt; Similarly, in the [[Forgotten Realms (comics)|comic-book series based on Forgotten Realms]], a wizard notes that after the upheavals in magic caused by the Troubles, some of his spells had changed in power and effect; and indeed, the game rules for those same spells had been revised.

==Deaths, ascensions, and resurrections==

The Time of Troubles was a time of significant turnover among the gods of the [[List of Forgotten Realms deities|Faerûnian Pantheon]].  Several deities were "destroyed" during this period.  The following are deities who were killed or incapacitated during the Time of Troubles:

*[[Bane (Forgotten Realms)|Bane]], greater god of [[tyranny]], strife, and [[hatred]] and one of the [[Dead Three]] gods, was slain in a battle with [[Elminster]] by the lingering essence of Mystra.&lt;ref name="Shadowdale"&gt;''[[Shadowdale (novel)|Shadowdale]]'', Richard Awlinson, TSR, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; He was revived by Myrkul and was slain again in a climactic battle with the [[demigod]] [[Torm (Forgotten Realms)|Torm]] in battle outside of [[Tantras (Forgotten Realms)|Tantras]].&lt;ref name="Tantras"&gt;''[[Tantras (novel)|Tantras]]'', Richard Awlinson, TSR, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bhaal (Forgotten Realms)|Bhaal]], intermediate god of [[murder]], was slain by the then-mortal [[Cyric]] with the sword ''[[Godsbane]]''.  However, Bhaal had foreseen his own death, and had populated Faerûn with his progeny, the ''[[Bhaalspawn]]'', in a bid to resurrect himself, as explored in the [[Baldur's Gate series]].
*[[Gilgeam]], demigod and king of [[Unther]], was slain by [[Tiamat (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Tiamat]] shortly after the Time of Troubles.&lt;ref name="PowersPantheons"&gt;''[[Powers &amp; Pantheons]]'', [[Eric L. Boyd]], TSR, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ibrandul]], a lesser god of caverns, was destroyed by [[Shar (Forgotten Realms)|Shar]], who still masquerades as the dead deity.&lt;ref name="FaithsNAvatars"&gt;''[[Faiths &amp; Avatars]]'', [[Julia Martin]] with Eric L. Boyd, TSR, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Leira (Forgotten Realms)|Leira]], lesser goddess of deception and illusion, was slain by Cyric shortly after the Time of Troubles.&lt;ref name="FaithsNAvatars"/&gt;
*[[Myrkul]], greater god of [[death|the dead]] and another of the Dead Three, was killed in a duel with Midnight, a mortal woman wielding the powers of Mystra, in the skies over the city of [[Waterdeep (city)|Waterdeep]].&lt;ref name="Waterdeep"&gt;''[[Waterdeep (novel)|Waterdeep]]'', Richard Awlinson, TSR, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mystra (Forgotten Realms)|Mystra]], greater goddess of [[Magic of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|magic]] and among the most powerful of the gods, was destroyed when she attempted to bypass Helm at the Celestial Staircase.&lt;ref name="Shadowdale"/&gt;
*[[Ramman]], Untheric lesser god of war and storms, was slain by [[Hoar (Forgotten Realms)|Hoar]], but his portfolio was stolen by [[Anhur]] of the [[Mulhorand]]i pantheon.&lt;ref name="PowersPantheons"/&gt;
*[[Tiamat (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Tiamat]]'s three-headed incarnation was slain by Gilgeam. Her essence was divided among three dragons, the red Tchazzar, the blue Gestaniius, and the green Skuthosiin. Tchazzar consumed the other two and was subsumed by Tiamat. The Dragon Queen then destroyed Gilgeam after the Godswar.&lt;ref name="PowersPantheons"/&gt;
*[[Torm (Forgotten Realms)|Torm]], demigod and patron deity of paladins, was annihilated by Bane with his dying breath. He was later resurrected by Ao because he died fulfilling the obligations of his portfolio.&lt;ref name="Tantras"/&gt;
*[[Waukeen]], lesser goddess of [[wealth]], attempted to reclaim her divinity during the Time of Troubles, but was imprisoned in the Argent Palace, enslaved to the demon prince [[Graz'zt]].&lt;ref name="DutyDeity"&gt;''[[For Duty and Deity]]'', [[Dale Donovan]], TSR, 1998; available for free download at http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dnd/downloads&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Zinzerena]], a drow demigoddess of chaos and thievery, was slain by [[Lolth]].

However, many of these deities have in some way circumvented their own destruction:

*After Bane's death, his portfolio was divided among the newly anointed god Cyric and Bane's own half-demonic son [[Iyachtu Xvim]]. Upon the death of one of the greatest forces of evil in existence, all of Faerûn breathed a sigh of relief; however, in 1372 DR, Bane was resurrected, destroying Iyachtu Xvim and reestablishing his church.&lt;ref name="FRCS"&gt;''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting]]'' (3rd edition), [[Ed Greenwood]], [[Sean K Reynolds]], [[Skip Williams]], and [[Rob Heinsoo]], Wizards of the Coast, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bhaal had already foreseen his own death, and had populated the world with scores of his own progeny in earlier years, each possessing a portion of his divine essence that could later be recovered to enable his resurrection.  This master plan is the basis of the [[Baldur's Gate series|Baldur's Gate]] computer game series.
*Myrkul infused the sinister artifact the [[Crown of Horns]] with the remnants of his essence, and teleported it away. While its location is unknown, the semi-sentient artifact is presumably fomenting a plan for Myrkul's resurrection.&lt;ref name="VoloATM"&gt;''[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]'', [[Ed Greenwood]] with [[Eric L. Boyd]], 1996; available for free download at http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dnd/downloads&lt;/ref&gt;
*Though Ao had decreed that none of the gods fallen during the Time of Troubles should be reinstated, a complex convergence of factors regarding Torm's death led the overgod to make a single exception in his case, resurrecting him and elevating him to the status of lesser god.&lt;ref name="Waterdeep"/&gt;
*After a decade of isolation from her followers, Waukeen was freed from her prison in 1371 DR by a band of adventurers, and has resumed her place in the heavens.&lt;ref name="FRCS"/&gt;

Furthermore, a selection of mortals were chosen by Lord Ao to ascend to the heavens to fill the void left by those deities who died:

* [[Cyric]], a petty, sadistic mercenary, slew Bhaal with the sword ''Godsbane'' (actually the god [[Mask (god)|Mask]] in disguise).  After the end of the Time of Troubles, he was granted control of nearly all the portfolios of the Dead Three by Ao, making him briefly the most powerful of the gods.&lt;ref name="Waterdeep"/&gt;
* After her death, the goddess Mystra entrusted her essence with the young [[Wizard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|mage]] [[Mystra (Forgotten Realms)|Midnight]], who ascended after the Time of Troubles as the new Mystra.&lt;ref name="Waterdeep"/&gt;
* [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane|Kelemvor]], a sullen adventurer and companion of Cyric and Mystra, seized the portfolio of death from Cyric in the Year of the Banner (1368 DR), 10 years after the Time of Troubles.&lt;ref name="Lies"&gt;''[[Prince of Lies (novel)|Prince of Lies]]'', [[James Lowder]], TSR, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; He has since striven to change the horrifying image of death promoted by his predecessor.&lt;ref name="Crucible"&gt;''[[Crucible: The Trial of Cyric the Mad]]'', [[Troy Denning]], TSR, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Lord Ao lifted the barrier that prevented the Mulhorandi god-kings from reuniting with their divine selves on the [[Outer Planes]]. The physical incarnations of the Mulhorandi gods departed Faerun and left governance of the empire to mortal rulers under their guidance.&lt;ref name="PowersPantheons"/&gt;

'''Tricana poveira''' is a traditional style of women's clothing from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] city of [[Póvoa de Varzim]]. This look, consisting of colorful costumes, was fashionable and mainstream from the 1920s to the 1960s. Women who dressed in the Tricana poveira style became known as tricana girls.

==Description==
[[File:Tricana desfile nocturno.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bairro da Mariadeira]] tricana girl]]
During tricana's heyday, a tricana girl would typically wear a shawl, an apron, a skirt, a handkerchief and glossy high-heeled slippers.&lt;ref name="vera"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cmpvtri"/&gt;

They were thought of as Povoan beauty icons. The author José de Azevedo, referring to their peculiar way of walking and dressing, called tricanas common people with the mannerisms of royalty.&lt;ref name= "Azevedo p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Azevedo|2007|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the fashion was based on traditional fishers' clothing, the Tricanas were generally from a blue collar background, often daughters of shoemakers, carpenters or similar craftsmen, while many worked as tailors themselves. They applied their knowledge derived from their background in fashion-related industries to their own dressing style. [[Bairro da Matriz]] quarter was famed for its charming and attractive tricanas.&lt;ref name= "Azevedo p. "/&gt;

Meanwhile, women actually working in the fishing industry would wear their traditional costumes. Though dressed similarly to the tricana girls, they were visibly poorer and wore longer skirts made of lower-quality materials and in darker colors.&lt;ref name= "Azevedo p. "/&gt;

Hair texturing techniques are also relevant to the style and follows traditional Povoan techniques, most notably the pulling of the hair called ''puxo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Arte do Puxo da Tricana  | publisher=A Voz da Póvoa | date=June 27, 2012 | url=http://www.vozdapovoa.com/noticia.asp?idEdicao=333&amp;id=12056&amp;idSeccao=3033&amp;Action=noticia | accessdate=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color code===
During parades, tricanas from the six traditional quarters wear dresses in their neighborhood colors.&lt;ref name="vera"&gt;{{cite web | title=Bairros com novidades para o S.

==History==

The tricana style's heyday was between the 1920s and the 1960s, when it had a strong impact both within Póvoa de Varzim and on outsiders visiting the city.&lt;ref name= "Azevedo p. "/&gt;

Tricana costumes were mainstream fashion amongst middle class teenagers until the appearance of ready-to-wear clothing in the 1970s. As younger people adopted more modern international fashions, tricana poveira now only appears in urban folklore groups and parades.&lt;ref name= "Azevedo p. "/&gt;

Nowadays, tricana costumes can be quite expensive depending on the preferences of the tricana girl and the materials used. Still kept as a strong tradition, tricana girls during ''Rusgas de São Pedro'' (Saint Peter Parades), play a big part in the city's festivities on June 28 and 29.&lt;ref name= "Azevedo p. "/&gt;

''Tricanas do Cidral'' (from Bairro da Matriz quarter), the first folklore group based on the tricana style, appeared as early as 1920.&lt;ref name="cmpvcidral"&gt;{{cite web | title=Associação Cultural e Recreativa da Matriz | publisher=CMPV | url=http://www.cm-pvarzim.pt/municipio/associacoes/associacoes-do-concelho-1/povoa-de-varzim/associacao-cultural-e-recreativa-da-matriz/?searchterm=tricana%20poveira | accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tricanas da Lapa'' (from Bairro Sul quarter) banded together in 1952, ''Rancho Estrela do Norte'' in 1954&lt;ref name="cmpvrenorte"&gt;{{cite web | title=55º Aniversário Rancho Estrela do Norte | publisher=CMPV | url=http://www.cm-pvarzim.pt/groups/staff/conteudo/noticias/55o-aniversario-rancho-estrela-do-norte/ | accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the regional ''Tricanas Poveiras'' in 1993.&lt;ref name="cmpvtri"&gt;{{cite web | title=Bairros com novidades para o S.
