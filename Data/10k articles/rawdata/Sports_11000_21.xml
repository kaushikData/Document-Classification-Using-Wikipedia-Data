{{2022 Commonwealth Games}}

The '''2022 Commonwealth Games''', officially known as the '''XXII Commonwealth Games''' and commonly known as '''Birmingham 2022''', is an international [[multi-sport event]] for members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] that is scheduled to be held in [[Birmingham]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/commonwealth-games/42437441|title=Commonwealth Games: Birmingham announced as host of 2022 event|date=2017-12-21|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to be the third time England has hosted the Games.

The Games are expected to take place between 27 July and 7 August 2022. The city was announced as the host at a press conference at the Arena Academy in Birmingham on 21 December 2017.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2017/12/21/birmingham-named-2022-commonwealth-games-host-city/|title=Birmingham named 2022 Commonwealth Games host city|last=Sport|first=Telegraph|date=2017-12-21|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Host selection==
{{main article|Bids for the 2022 Commonwealth Games}}

=== First selection ===
Two cities initially launched bids for the games; [[Durban]], [[South Africa]] and [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]], [[Canada]]. Edmonton withdrew its bid in February 2015, leaving Durban as the only bid to go forward to CGF General Assembly in September 2015.&lt;ref name="euronews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2015/02/11/edmonton-withdraws-bid-for-2022-commonwealth-games/ |title=Edmonton withdraws bid for 2022 Commonwealth Games &amp;#124; euronews, world news |publisher=Euronews.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coastal South African city of [[Durban]] initially secured the right to host the games, as they were the sole bidder for the event. The city previously considered bidding for the [[2020 Summer Olympics|2020]] or [[2024 Summer Olympics]].

====Withdrawal of Durban as host====
It was reported in February 2017 that [[Durban]] may be unable to host the games due to financial constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39116534|title=Commonwealth Games 2022: Durban 'may drop out as host'|date=2017-02-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed one month later on 13 March 2017 when the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] (CGF) stripped Durban of their rights to host the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/commonwealth-games/durban-stripped-of-2022-commonwealth-games-20170313-guxc9d.html|title=Durban stripped of 2022 Commonwealth Games|date=2017-03-14|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would have marked the first time the games were held in [[Africa]] and the second time a [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth republic]] would have hosted, following [[Delhi]], [[India]] in [[2010 Commonwealth Games|2010]]. The games were set to open on the 18 July 2022, coinciding with the birthday of the late South African President, [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.durban-2022.com/|title=Durban is #ReadyToInspire, are you?|website=Durban-2022|language=en|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second selection ===
A new bidding process was launched, where [[Liverpool]] and [[Birmingham]] expressed their interests in hosting the games.&lt;ref name="Liverpool-Birmingham"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rumsby|first1=Ben|title=Liverpool and Birmingham battle to host Commonwealth Games 2022|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2017/03/13/liverpool-birmingham-battle-host-commonwealth-games-2022/|accessdate=14 March 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 March 2017, [[Manchester]], who previously hosted the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]], expressed their interest in hosting the games.&lt;ref name="Manchester"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Jennifer|title=Manchester in discussions to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-discussions-hold-2022-commonwealth-12742043|accessdate=14 March 2017|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, Birmingham beat Liverpool for the recommended bid for England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/athletics/commonwealth-games-birmingham-beats-liverpool-become-uk-candidate-bid-a7934286.html|title=Birmingham beats Liverpool for hosting the 2022 commonwealth games|website=www.independent.co.uk|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Birmingham being the sole bidder for the event they won the right to stage the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/commonwealth-games/41185554|title=Birmingham beats Liverpool to become UK candidate for potential 2022 Commonwealth bid|date=7 September 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1052997/commonwealth-games-england-to-reveal-2022-candidate-city-in-September|title=Commonwealth Games England to reveal 2022 candidate city in September|publisher=Inside the Game|date=20 July 2017|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was announced that the bid was not fully compliant, and the bidding process was extended until 30 November 2017.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/41525305|title=Commonwealth Games 2022: Birmingham bid 'not fully compliant'|date=6 October 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CGF had 170 questions regarding Birmingham's bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/41823005|title=Commonwealth Games Federation had '170 queries' over Birmingham's 2022 bid|date=31 October 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birmingham awarded as replacement host====
On 21 December 2017, Birmingham was awarded for the 2022 Games as Durban's replacement host.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Louise Martin, president of the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]], made the official announcement at a press conference at the Arena Academy in Birmingham.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Venues ==
Birmingham has a wealth of existing sports venues, arenas and conference halls that are ideal for hosting sport during the Games. 95% of the competition venues are already in place for the 2022 games.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birmingham2022.com/|title=Birmingham 2022 Heart of the UK, Soul of the Commonwealth|website=www.birmingham2022.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Stadium]] which is scheduled to host the ceremonies and athletics is planned to be renovated and the capacity increased to 50,000 seats. A new 400 metre warm up track is also planned.

This would leave the stadium well placed to become the home of [[UK Athletics]], hosting all the major national and international competitions after the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/how-alexander-stadium-transformed-birmingham-13259753|title=See how Alexander Stadium could be transformed for Commonwealth Games|last=Elkes|first=Neil|date=2017-06-30|work=birminghammail|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2017, the BBC Reported that the organisers of the games are currently in talks with the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC)  about the inclusion of women's cricket. It was also reported that shooting is likely to be excluded from the games citing a lack of facilities around Birmingham, if this is true it will be the first time since 1970 where shooting has not been included in the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/commonwealth-games/42458483|title=Birmingham 2022: Four unanswered questions for the Commonwealth Games|date=2017-12-22|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dropping of shooting from the games programme was confirmed by the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] CEO, David Grevemberg in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://aroundtherings.com/site/A__62549/Title__Optional-Sports-at-2022-Commonwealth-Games/292/Articles|title=Optional Sports at 2022 Commonwealth Games|date=2018-01-18|work=Around the Rings|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/shooting/42753120|title=Birmingham 2022: Shooting dropped from Commonwealth Games|date=2018-01-19|work=BBC|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/no-shooting-at-commonwealth-games-top-official-suggests-t20-mixed-cricket-4993578/|title=No shooting at 2022 Commonwealth Games, top official suggests T20 mixed cricket|date=2018-01-19|work=Indian Express|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018,the ICC confirmed that they have submitted a bid to include women's cricket in Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/922079 |title=ICC bids for Women's Cricket in Commonwealth Games |work=International Cricket Council |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''billiard ball''' is a small, hard [[ball]] used in [[cue sports]], such as [[carom billiards]], [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]], and [[snooker]]. The number, type, diameter, color, and pattern of the balls differ depending upon the specific game being played. Various particular ball properties such as [[hardness]], [[friction coefficient]] and [[Resilience (materials science)|resilience]] are important to accuracy.

==History==
Early balls were made of various materials, including wood and clay (the latter remaining in use well into the 20th century). Although affordable [[ox]]-bone balls were in common use in Europe,&lt;ref name="ebay"&gt;Note: Antique ox-bone balls remain a very common item on [[eBay]].&lt;/ref&gt; elephant [[ivory]] was favored since at least 1627 until the early 20th century;&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999"&gt;{{Shamos 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} the earliest known written reference to ivory billiard balls is in the 1588 inventory of the [[Duke of Norfolk]].&lt;ref name="Everton 1986"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century, elephants were being slaughtered for their ivory at an alarming rate, just to keep up with the demand for high-end billiard balls – no more than eight balls could be made from a single elephant's tusks.{{citation needed|date=February 2010|reason=When sourced, this should probably be added to the article on elephants.}} Dyed and numbered balls appeared around the early 1770s.&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999" /&gt;{{rp|17}} The billiard industry realized that the supply of elephants (their primary source of ivory) was [[endangered species|endangered]], as well as dangerous to obtain (the latter an issue of notable public concern at the turn of the 19th century).&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999" /&gt;{{rp|17}} Inventors were challenged to come up with an alternative material that could be [[Manufacturing|manufactured]], with a [[United States dollar|US$]]10,000 prize being offered by a New York supplier,&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999" /&gt;{{rp|17}} [[Michael Phelan (billiards)|Phelan]] and [[H.

Although not the first artificial substance to be used for the balls (e.g. [[Sorel cement]], invented in 1867, was marketed as an artificial ivory), [[John Wesley Hyatt]] invented a composition material in 1869 called [[nitrocellulose]] for billiard balls (US patent 50359, the first American patent for billiard balls). It is unclear if the cash prize was ever awarded&lt;!--to anyone, that is--&gt;, and there is no evidence suggesting he did in fact win it.&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999" /&gt;{{rp|17}}&lt;ref name="Plastiquarian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plastiquarian.com/hyatt.htm |title=Hyatt |author= |year=2002 |work=Plastiquarian.com |location=London |publisher=[[Plastics Historical Society]] |accessdate=26 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221114457/http://www.plastiquarian.com/hyatt.htm |archivedate=21 December 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1870 it was commercially branded [[Celluloid]], the first industrial plastic. However, the nature of celluloid made it volatile in production, occasionally exploding, which ultimately made this early plastic impractical.&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999" /&gt;{{rp|17}} Subsequently, to avoid the problem of celluloid instability, the industry experimented with various other synthetic materials for billiard balls such as [[Bakelite]], [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Crystallite]] and other plastic compounds.

The exacting requirements of the billiard ball are met today with balls cast from plastic materials that are strongly resistant to cracking and chipping. Currently [[Saluc]], under the brand names Aramith and Brunswick Centennial, manufactures [[phenolic resin]] balls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saluc.com/html/billiard/index.php Aramith]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brunswickbilliards.com/our_rich_history/billiard_balls/index.html|title=History|work=brunswickbilliards.com|access-date=9 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327190020/http://www.brunswickbilliards.com/our_rich_history/billiard_balls/index.html|archive-date=27 March 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other plastics and resins such as [[polyester]] (under various trade names) and clear [[Acrylic glass|acrylic]] are also used, by competing companies such as Elephant Balls Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ElephantBalls.com Elephant Balls Ltd.]&lt;/ref&gt; and Frenzy Sports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.FrenzySports.com/productinfo.htm Frenzy Sports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107092229/http://www.frenzysports.com/productinfo.htm |date=7 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pool balls are used to play various [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] (pocket billiards or pool billiards) games, such as [[eight-ball]], [[nine-ball]] and [[one-pocket]]. In North America and Asia, they are referred to simply as "billiard balls" (except among carom and snooker players). These balls, used the most widely throughout the world, are considerably smaller than carom billiards balls, slightly larger than British-style pool balls and substantially larger than those for snooker. According to [[World Pool-Billiard Association|WPA]]/[[Billiard Congress of America|BCA]] equipment specifications, the weight may be from {{cvt|5.5|to(-)|6.0|oz|g}} with a diameter of {{cvt|2.250|in|mm}}, plus or minus {{cvt|0.005|in|mm|3}}.&lt;ref name="WPAequipspec"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpa-pool.com/web/WPA_Tournament_Table_Equipment_Specifications |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928165510/http://www.wpa-pool.com/web/WPA_Tournament_Table_Equipment_Specifications |archivedate=2013-09-28 |title=WPA Tournament Table &amp; Equipment Specifications |work=WPA-Pool.com |publisher=World Pool-Billiard Association |date=November 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BCAbook"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are often referred to as {{convert|2+1/4|in|mm|adj=on}} balls. The balls are numbered and colored as in the table.
[[File:Baseball pool balls and rack.png|thumb|Extended set for [[baseball pocket billiards]].]]
In [[baseball pocket billiards]], the ball set is extended to 21 balls, in which the 16 ball is black and white, while balls 17 through 21 have no special design, but look exactly like balls 9 through 13, respectively, except for their numbers.

Balls 1 through 7 are often referred to as {{Cuegloss|Solids|solids}} and 9 through 15 as {{Cuegloss|Stripes|stripes}} though there are many other colloquial terms for each {{Cuegloss|Suit|suit}} of balls (highs and lows, etc.). Striped balls were introduced around 1889.&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999" /&gt;{{rp|246}} Though it looks similar to the solids, the 8 ball is not considered a solid because it is the only ball that is black. Some games such as nine-ball do not distinguish between stripes and solids, but rather use the numbering on the balls to determine which {{Cuegloss|Object ball|object ball}} must be pocketed. In other games such as [[three-ball]] and [[straight pool]] neither type of marking is of any consequence. In eight-ball, straight pool, and related games, all sixteen balls are employed. In the games of [[seven-ball]], nine-ball, [[ten-ball]] and related, only object balls 1 through 7, 9 and 10, respectively (plus the cue ball) are used.

Some balls used in televised pool games are colored differently in order to make them distinguishable on television monitors. Specifically, the 4 ball is colored pink instead of dark purple, and the 12 is white with a pink stripe, to make it easier to distinguish their color from the black 8 ball, and similarly the 7 and 15 balls use a light tan color instead of a deep brown. Television was also the genesis of the cue ball with six red spots on its surface (known as a "measle" cue ball) so that {{Cuegloss|Spin|spin}} placed on it is evident to viewers.

Coin-operated pool tables such as those found at [[Bar (establishment)|bars]] historically have often used either a larger ("mudball") or denser ceramic weighted cue ball, such that its extra weight makes it easy for the cue ball return mechanism to separate it from object balls (which are captured until the game ends and the table is paid again for another game) so that the cue ball can be returned for further play, should it be accidentally potted. In Asia  and Europe, some pool tables use a smaller cue ball instead. Modern tables usually employ a magnetic ball of regulation or near-regulation size and weight, since players have complained for many decades that the heavy and often oversized cue balls do not "play" correctly.&lt;!--R. Givens's "Eight-ball Bible" can be cited on these points, but my copy is missing. -SMcCandlish--&gt;

===British-style pool (blackball)===
[[File:SetUpofTriangleForStandardPool.jpg|left|thumb|145px|Setup for blackball]]
In WPA [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]] and its predecessor [[World Eight-ball Pool Federation|WEPF]] or ''English eight-ball pool'' (not to be confused with the games of eight-ball or English billiards), fifteen object balls again are used, but fall into two unnumbered {{Cuegloss|Group|groups}}, the {{Cuegloss|Red ball|reds}} (or less commonly {{Cuegloss|Blue ball|blues}}) and {{Cuegloss|Yellow ball|yellows}}, with a white cue ball, and black 8 ball. Aside from the 8, shots are not {{Cuegloss|Call-shot|called}} since there is no reliable way to identify particular balls to be pocketed. Because they are unnumbered they are wholly unsuited to certain pool games, such as nine-ball, in which ball order is important. They are noticeably smaller than the American-style balls, and with a cue ball that is slightly smaller than the object balls, while the table's {{Cuegloss|Pocket|pockets}} are tighter to compensate. Neither the WPA nor the WEPF (publicly) define ball or even table dimensions, though presumably{{cn|date=August 2017}} league and tournament organizers are given some guidelines in this regard. Most manufacturers that supply this market provide sets that range from {{convert|2|in|mm|0}} up to {{convert|2+3/16|in|mm|0}}, often with a slightly smaller cue ball, e.g. {{cvt|1+7/8|in|mm|0}} for a 2-inch set. The most common object ball diameters are {{cvt|2|in|mm|0}} and {{cvt|2+1/8|in|mm|0}}. The yellow-and-red sets are sometimes commercially referred to as "casino sets" (they were formerly used for televised eight-ball championships,&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999"/&gt;{{rp|45}} most often held in casinos). The use of such sets, however, predates television, as they were used for B.B.C. Co. Pool, the forerunner of modern eight-ball, at least as early as 1908.&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999" /&gt;{{rp|24}}

===Snooker===

Ball sets for the sport of snooker look at first glance like a mixture of American- and British-style pool balls. There are twenty-two balls in total, arranged as a rack of 15 unmarked reds, six {{Cuegloss|Colour ball|colour balls}} placed at various predetermined spots on the table, and a white cue ball. ''(See [[snooker]] for more information on ball setup.)''

The colour balls are sometimes numbered American-style, with their point values, for the amateur/home market, as follows in the adjacent table.

Snooker balls are technically standardized at {{cvt|52.5|mm|in|2}} in diameter within a tolerance of plus or minus {{cvt|0.05|mm|in|3}}. No standard weight is defined, but all balls in the set must be the same weight within a tolerance of {{cvt|3|g|oz|2}}.&lt;ref name="WSAequipspec"&gt;[http://www.worldsnooker.com/equipment.htm "Equipment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801105033/http://www.worldsnooker.com/equipment.htm |date=1 August 2008 }}, World Snooker Association, publication date unknown (Retrieved 28 January 2007), London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many sets are actually {{cvt|2+1/16|in|mm|1}}, even from major manufacturers. Snooker sets are also available with considerably smaller-than-regulation balls (and even with ten instead of fifteen reds) for play on smaller tables (down to half-size), and are sanctioned for use in some amateur leagues. Sets for [[Snooker|American snooker]] are typically {{cvt|2+1/8|in|mm|1}}, with numbered colour balls.

The set of eight colours used for snooker balls (including white) are thought to be derived from the game of [[croquet]]. Snooker was invented in 1884 by [[Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain|British Army officers]] stationed in India. Croquet reached its peak popularity at the same time, particularly amongst people in the same social context. The eight coloured balls of croquet use the same identical set of eight colours. There are many other similarities between croquet and snooker, which when taken together, suggest that the derivation of the latter owes much to the existence of the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Introduction to Croquet: A Brief History|url=https://www.croquet.org.uk/?p=tech/CroquetIntro#history|publisher=The Croquet Association (of England and Wales)|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other games have their own variants of billiard balls. [[English billiards]] balls are like carom balls but are the same size as snooker balls. [[Russian pyramid]] uses a set of fifteen numbered but otherwise all-white balls, and a red or yellow cue ball that may be even larger than carom billiards balls at 68&amp;nbsp;mm (2&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;in) or 72&amp;nbsp;mm (2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; in). The related game [[kaisa (billiards)|kaisa]] has the same pocket and ball dimensions but uses only five balls: one yellow, two red and two cue balls, one for each player.&lt;ref name="BVRP"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bumper pool]] requires four white and four red object balls, and two special balls, one red with a white spot and the other white with red spot; all are usually {{frac|2|1|8}} inch (approximately 52.5&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter. [[Bar billiards]] uses six or seven white balls (depending on regional variations) and one red ball {{cvt|1+7/8|in|mm|0}} in diameter.

===Training balls===
[[File:Jim Rempe practice ball.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The [[Jim Rempe]] Training Ball]]
Several brands of practice balls exist, which have systems of spots, stripes, differently colored halves and/or targeting rings.

For example, Saluc markets several practice ball systems, including the Jim Rempe Training Ball, a {{Cuegloss|Cue ball|cue ball}} marked with rings and targets on the surface of the ball so that the practicing player can better judge the effects of very particular amounts of {{Cuegloss|Sidespin|sidespin}}, {{Cuegloss|Topspin|topspin}}, {{Cuegloss|Backspin|backspin}} and other forms of cue ball control, and learn better control of [[Cue stick|cue]] {{Cuegloss|Stroke|stroke}}.&lt;ref name="Saluc 1"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.saluc.com/html/index.php?idlien=17 |title=Product Line &amp;gt; Training Balls|year=2005|work=Saluc.com|publisher=[[Saluc|Saluc S.A.]]|location=Callenelle, Belgium|accessdate=2008-02-18}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various competing products, such as several other Saluc models&lt;ref name="Saluc 1" /&gt; and Elephant Practice Balls,&lt;ref name="Elephant"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.elephantballs.com/store/products/22 |title=Elephant Practice Balls|year=2007|work=ElephantBalls.com|publisher=Elephant Balls, Ltd.|location=Columbus, Ohio|accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; use a similar aiming system. Some such sets consist of just a special cue ball and manual, while others also include an object ball marked for aiming practice.

===Novelty balls===
[[File:Novelty billiard balls.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Various novelty [[pocket billiards]] balls. Clockwise from the top: Red and white balls and markers from a proprietary game called Starball; an [[Elvis Presley]] commemorative cue ball from [[Graceland]]; a [[leopard]]-patterned 9 ball; colorful balls from a [[poker]]-themed set; regular balls and the small "jack" from a miniature [[bocce]] set used on a table instead of a lawn or court.]]
There is a market for specialty cue balls and even entire ball sets, featuring sports team logos, cartoon characters, animal pelt patterns, etc.

Entrepreneurial inventors also supply a variety of novelty billiard games with unique rules and balls, some with playing card markings, others with stars and stripes, and yet others in sets of more than thirty balls in several suits. Marbled-looking and glittery materials are also popular for home tables. There are even [[blacklight]] sets for playing in near-dark. There are also [[practical joke]] cue and 8 balls, with off-center weights in them that make their paths curve and wobble. Miniature sets in various sizes (typically {{frac||2|3}} or {{frac||1|2}} of normal size) are also commonly available, primarily intended for undersized toy tables. Even an egg-shaped ball has been patented&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent No. 7,468,002&lt;/ref&gt; and marketed under such names as Bobble Ball and Tag Ball.

==In popular culture==
[[File:8 ball face.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Magic 8 Ball]]]]
[[File:USS Sam Rayburn (SSBN-635) missile hatches.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ballistic missile submarine]] {{USS|Sam Rayburn|SSBN-635|6}} displays a billiard motif on her missile hatches]]
The 8 ball is frequently used iconically in Western, especially American, culture. It can often be found as an element of T-shirt designs, album covers and names, tattoos, household goods like paperweights and cigarette lighters, belt buckles, etc. A classic toy is the [[Magic 8-Ball]] "oracle". [[Don and Ron Harris|A wrestler]], [[Eightball &amp; MJG|a rapper]], and [[8-Ball (band)|a rock band]] have all independently adopted the name. The term "8 ball" is also [[slang]] both for {{frac||1|8}}&amp;nbsp;[[Ounce|oz.]] of [[cocaine]] or [[crystal methamphetamine|crystal meth]], and for a bottle of [[Olde English 800]] [[malt liquor]]. It has also been used to refer to African-Americans, particularly those of darker skin tones, as in the film ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''. The expression "behind the eight [ball]" is used to indicate a [[dilemma]] from which it is difficult to extricate oneself. The term derives from the game kelly pool.&lt;ref name="IEOB"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shamos | first = Michael Ian | year = 1993 | title = The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Billiards | publisher = Lyons &amp; Burford | location = New York City | pages = 85, 128 and 168  | isbn = 1-55821-219-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jewett | first = Bob |date=February 2002 | title = 8-Ball Rules: The many different versions of one of today's most common games | journal = Billiards Digest Magazine | pages = Pages 22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hickok (2001).

Because the [[Collision#Billiards|collisions between billiard balls]] are nearly [[Elastic collision|elastic]], and the balls roll on a surface that produces low [[rolling friction]], their behavior is often used to illustrate [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Idealized, frictionless billiard balls are a staple of [[Mathematics|mathematical]] theorems and [[physics]] models, and figure in [[dynamical billiards]], [[scattering theory]], [[Lissajous knots]], [[billiard ball computing]] and [[Reversible cellular automaton|reversible cellular automata]], [[Polchinski's paradox]], [[contact dynamics]], [[collision detection]], the [[illumination problem]], [[Ultracold atom|atomic ultracooling]], [[quantum mirage]]s and elsewhere in these fields.

"Billiard balls" or "pool balls" is the name given to balls used in [[stage magic]] tricks, especially the classic "[[multiplying billiard balls]]". Though obviously derived from real billiard balls, today they are usually smaller, for easier manipulation and hiding, but not so small and light that they are difficult to [[juggle]], as the magic and juggling disciplines have often overlapped since their successful combination by pioneers like [[Paul Vandy]].

An urban legend received cultural attention to many saying, "If the [[Earth]] were the size of a billiard ball, it would be smoother". It was used in 2008's Discover Magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/09/08/ten-things-you-dont-know-about-the-earth/#.VpDO6I-cGCg |title=Ten things you don't know about the Earth |publisher=Bad Astronomy |date=8 September 2008 |accessdate=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but mistook the diameter tolerance for smoothness. If the Earth were reduced to the size of a billiard ball, much of it, excluding the [[Himalayas]] and [[Mariana Trench]], would be smoother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billiards.colostate.edu/bd_articles/2013/june13.pdf |title=Is a Pool Ball Smoother than the Earth? |publisher=Billiards Digest |date=1 June 2013 |accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also: [[Earth#Shape|Earth's Shape]])

The phrase "as smooth as a billiard ball" is sometimes applied to describe a [[Baldness|bald person]], and the term "cue ball" is also slang for someone who sports a [[shaved head]].

In [[Polandball]], numbered pool balls are used to denote aboriginal, prehistoric, or native peoples who do not have a flag of their own. Green 6-balls also denote [[extraterrestrial intelligence|extraterrestrials]].

'''Clifton College Close''' is a [[cricket]] venue in [[Clifton College]], [[Bristol]], which was used by [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] for 96 [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches between 1871 and 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/351_f.html CricketArchive – First-class matches on Clifton College Close. Retrieved on 11 March 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is first recorded as a cricket venue in 1860 and remains in use for local matches in 2013.

The Close witnessed 13 of [[W. G. Grace]]'s first-class hundreds for Gloucestershire in the County Championship. Grace's children attended the college.

The Close featured in the poem by [[Old Cliftonian]] [[Sir Henry Newbolt]] – ''Vitaї Lampada''

:There's a breathless hush in the Close to-night
:Ten to make and the match to win
:A bumping pitch and a blinding light,
:An hour to play, and the last man in.
:And it's not for the sake of a ribboned coat.
:Or the selfish hope of a season's fame,
:But his captain's hand on his shoulder smote
:"Play up! Play up! And play the game!"

:The sand of the desert is sodden red –
:Red with the wreck of the square that broke
:The gatling's jammed and the colonel dead,
:And the regiment blind with dust and smoke.

:The river of death has brimmed its banks,
:And England's far, and Honour a name,
:But the voice of a schoolboy rallies the ranks –
:"Play up! Play up! And play the game!"

:This is the word that year by year,
:While in her place the school is set,
:Every one of her sons must hear,
:And none that hears it dare forget.
:This they all with a joyful mind
:Bear through life like a torch in flame,
:And falling fling to the host behind –
:"Play up! Play up! And play the game!"

'''HK Orange 20''' is an [[ice hockey]] team, which plays in the [[Slovak Extraliga]] since the 2007/2008 season.

The team was established after a disappointing performance by the [[Slovakia men's national junior ice hockey team]] in the previous world junior competition. This is partially due to nervousness after the Czech U18 team was relegated and the Slovak U20 team came very close.  The youth players from across the league were placed on the team, with a notable amount coming from [[HK Dukla Trenčín]] and [[HC Slovan Bratislava]].

The team only plays games on Fridays and Sundays. It is also excluded from the last week before the winter break and from the playoffs, as the team prepares for the [[IIHF World U20 Championship]].

The '''Hartford Golf Club Historic District''' encompasses a golf course and adjacent residential neighborhood in [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]] and [[Hartford, Connecticut]].  The area, developed between 1915 and 1936, includes the Hartford Golf Club, designed by [[Donald Ross (golfer)|Donald Ross]], the area's oldest golf course, and a neighborhood with a high concentration of high quality Colonial and Tudor Revival houses.  It is roughly bounded by Simsbury Road on the north, Bloomfield Avenue on the east, Albany Avenu to the south, and Mohegan Drive to the west.  The district was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

==Description and history==
The Hartford Golf Club was founded in 1896, and immediately became a magnet for the social and business elite of Hartford.  Its first golf course was built south of the present property, between Albany and Asylum Avenues.  That course's thirteen-hole layout was problematic due to the terrain, and the club in 1914 purchased the southern portion of its present holdings.  It hired Donald Ross to design the holes in this area, where fourteen holes were built.  An eighteen-hole course was then made out of those plus four holes south of Albany Avenue.  In 1945, the club purchased the northernmost portion of its land, which was developed with thirteen new holes, apparently also based on Donald Ross designs.  The land south of Albany Avenue was sold in 1955.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|86001370}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination:  Hartford Golf Club Historic District|publisher=[[National Park Service]] |author=Gregory E. Andrews and John Herzan |date=April 28, 1986 |accessdate=April 25, 2017}}  With {{NRHP url|id=86001370|photos=y|title=19 photos}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The golf club's 1914 purchased kicked off a residential construction boom to its southwest.  Over the next twenty years, a neighborhood of high quality [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] and [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] houses were built on large well-landscaped lots, and it came to be one of West Hartford's most fashionable neighborhoods of the period.  Roads were laid out in large rectangles, and properties adjacent to the golf were the largest and most lavish in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt;

[[Image:Indian clubs.jpg|thumb|upright|A pair of painted Indian clubs from the late 19th century.]]
'''Indian clubs''',  or '''Persian meels''' (also ''mils''), were a 19th-century type of [[exercise]] equipment, originating from the [[Indian subcontinent]],  used to present resistance in movement to develop strength and mobility. They consist of bowling-pin shaped wooden clubs of varying sizes and weights, which are swung in certain patterns as part of a strength exercise program. They can range in weight from a few pounds each to special clubs that can weigh as much as up to 100 pounds. They were used in carefully-choreographed routines in which the clubs were swung in unison by a group of exercisers, led by an instructor,  similar to the USA's 21st century [[aerobics]] or [[zumba]] classes. The routines would vary according to the group's ability along with the weights of the clubs being used.

Despite their common English name implying an Indian origin, the so-called Indian clubs were in fact originally found in [[Persia]], where they are referred to as meels or mils ({{lang-fa|میل|mil}}).&lt;ref name="BBC 2004"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3647621.stm |title=Muscular Shias return to roots |date=22 April 2004 |website=[[BBC News]] |access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Specimens of the Popular Poetry of Persia: As Found in the Adventures and Improvisations of Kurroglou, the Bandit-minstrel of Northern Persia and in the Songs of the People Inhabiting the Shores of the Caspian Sea|date=1842|publisher=Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland|page=457|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=22IPAQAAMAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest records of this type of resistance device  being used by wrestlers predates the 19th century, in ancient [[Persia]], [[Egypt]] and the rest of the [[Middle East]]. Their  practice has continued to the present day, notably in the [[varzesh-e bastani]] tradition practiced in the [[zurkaneh]] of [[Iran]]. From Persia, the [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughals]] brought meels to India, where they are still used by [[pehlwani|pehlwan]] (wrestlers) today. When the 19th century British colonists came across meels in India, they naturally referred to them as "Indian clubs," ignoring their Persian origin.

Exceptionally popular during the fitness movement of the late [[Victorian era]], used by military cadets and well-heeled ladies alike, they  appeared as a gymnastic event in the [[gymnastics at the 1904 Summer Olympics|1904]] and [[gymnastics at the 1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Olympics]]. Gymnasiums were built solely to cater to club exercise groups. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries they became increasingly common in Europe, the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and the [[United States]].

Circa 1913/14 the Bodyguard unit of the British [[suffragette]] movement carried Indian clubs as concealed weapons for use against the truncheons of the police&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/925307642|title=My own story|last=1858-1928,|first=Pankhurst, Emmeline,|isbn=1784871257|location=London|oclc=925307642}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{cite needed|date=April 2017}}

The popularity of Indian clubs waned in Europe during the 1920s and 1930s as organized sports became more prevalent. Regimented exercise routines, like those requiring Indian clubs, were relegated to professional athletes and the military, who had access to more effective and modern [[strength training]] equipment.

While torches and other stick-like objects have been used in [[juggling]] for centuries, the modern [[juggling club]] was inspired by Indian clubs, which were first repurposed for juggling by DeWitt Cook [[History of juggling|in the 1800s]].

There are physical fitness enthusiasts reviving the usage of Indian Clubs in the early 21st century, citing the [[aerobic exercise]] and safety advantages over traditional free weight regimens. There are nostalgic replicas of the original clubs being manufactured, as well as modern engineering updates to the concept, such as the Clubbell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clubbell training|url=https://stumptuous.com/clubbell-training|website=Stumptuous.COM|date=18 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=English|first1=Nick|title=The Surprising Benefits of Club Training for Strength - BarBend|url=https://barbend.com/surprising-benefits-club-training-strength/|website=BarBend|accessdate=2 April 2017|date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Labour and Amateur Sports Confederation''' (French: Confédération Sportive Internationale Travailliste et Amateur, '''CSIT''') is an international multi-sports organization. The organization celebrated its 100 years anniversary in 2013. The core principles of contributing to physical activity and sports have stayed in its action policy: it is a right of man and woman to practice sport by his/her own conditions. The key concept of the CSIT’s sport policy has always been in sport for all. – The policy stems from the historic ideas of the [[Socialist Workers' Sport International|international worker sport movement.]]

Nowadays, the main activities that the CSIT is organizing are the major and small sports events, more precisely Sport for All - games for amateurs and workers, competitive and non-competitive, for young and old, men and women from all over the world. Sports events are considered as festivals of friendship, cultural exchange, events promoting awareness of tolerance, respect, sustainability and fair play in sport environment addressed to unlimited size of participants; all those major and small events welcome the CSIT members, other non-member organizations, cooperation partners, governmental bodies, trade unions and business companies with sports activities for employees and amateurs worldwide.

Within the world of international sport, the CSIT maintains its support for everyone to benefit from sporting activities regardless of their qualifications, talent, nationality, age, sex and social circumstances.

During last two decades the CSIT has grown rapidly up to a global organization with altogether 31 national member organizations. They are in alphabetical order: FAST (Algeria), UNTA (Angola), ASKOE (Austria), AFSTB (Belgium), FROS (Belgium), BWF Sport &amp; Health (Bulgaria), CWCIE (China), PASEK (Cyprus), DAI (Denmark), JOUD (Estonia), KALEV (Estonia), TUL (Finland), FFST (France), FSGT (France), Rad- und Kraftfahrerbund ”Solidarität” Deutchland 1896 e.v. (Germany), AFWSI (Iran), AAI (Ireland), HAPOEL (Israel), ACSI (Italy), AICS (Italy), LTSA (Latvia), ”ZALGIRIS” (Lithuania), INDET (Mexico), NCS (Netherlands), INATEL (Portugal), CSE (Romania), ”Atomsport” (Russia), ZZBSS (Slovenia), SATUS (Switzerland), ONCST (Tunisia) and HIS (Turkey).

In addition there are two (sub) continental members: one from Americas (Confederacao Pan-Americana de Desporto do Trabalhador COPADET) and the other from Europe (Balkan Association for Workers’ Sport BAWS).  Furthermore, in January 2018 there were eight candidate members in process to become regular CSIT members; namely ANASTACAM (Cameron), UCEC (Spain, Catalonia), ICSF (Iraq), WSFI (India, LIBERTAS  (Italy), CSEN (Italy), MASA (Mongolia) and FederSwiss – Sport for All (Switzerland).

== Objective ==

The relevance of the CSIT sport policy is growing with importance, especially when commercialization and the lack of facilities and economic resources are reducing sports participation to passive entertainment for the vast majority of people. The CSIT is an organization, which aims at promoting and broadening workers' and amateurs' sport activities and thus developing into a world-wide movement. All activities pursue aspirations for democracy, solidarity and improvement of the quality of life through sport. The movement should encompass all sports federations and hence it would be possible to provide better opportunities for varied physical exercise for all citizens.

As stated above the CSIT stands for promotion of tolerance, respect, fair play, friendship, intercultural dialogue and integration through sport. A “Zero Tolerance” - Policy towards violence, fanatic behaviour and racism is pursued accurately.

== Fields of Activity ==

As listed the fields of the CSIT activities are as follows:
* '''Sports Championships from young to seniors'''  The championships are not games for professional top athletes, but for all workers and amateurs from different countries and cultures all over the world. Not only organizing competitions is in the foreground, but also organizing a huge festival with the objective of gathering sports friends as a worldwide family to advance the making of lifelong friendships, the exchange of information and experiences.
* '''Sports for All Activities: Sports for Elderly People (Seniors 55+)'''   The task is to organize events also for elderly ones by gathering them to the following experiences: to  practice and discovery of specific sports and physical activities, the exchange of training programs and knowledge relating to these and the exchange about culture, tourism and way of life of each country.
* '''Young Leaders Platform'''   The purpose of the Younger Leaders Platform is to share projects, events and camps, diffuse ideas and innovations, give information about different organizations, strengthen networks and ways of collaboration, learn to know better each other and develop a mutual support by sharing the expertise.

== Relevant Activities and Experiences ==

The achievement of the following aims is the most important task of the CSIT:
* to  bring together workers and amateur sports organizations of the entire world and to promote the foundation of new organizations,
* to co-operate with international organizations with the same goals and values,
* to support member organizations with their tasks and activities in all the fields of sport and physical culture, also through agreements with international organizations and authorities,
* to promote all activities that aim to improve the practice of sports by human beings of two sexes considering their age and their physical aptitudes in order to protect and improve their health;
* to achieve the aims by respecting the amateur status of athletes, the values of amateurism and the educational values of sport,
* to encourage to practice sport and physical activity in nature while considering the protection of the environment,
* to use sport as a means to promote peace and mutual understanding among people and to contribute to development of the world of social associations at any level,
* to sustain cultural advancement and to improve health including psychophysical conditions of the member unions as well as its individual members.

== Pillars of CSIT ==
The objectives of the CSIT are conducted in praxis by clearly defined pillars. They are the CSIT World Sports Games, the CSIT Single Championships, the International Tournaments, the International Festivals, the Sport for All-activities, the International Projects and the Health, Recreation and Fitness Activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42531">In the [[United States]], most universities and colleges [[List of college athletic programs by U.S. state|that sponsor athletics programs]] have adopted an official nickname for its associated teams. Often, these nicknames have changed for any number of reasons, which might include a change in the name of the school itself, a term becoming dated or otherwise changing meaning, or changes in racial perceptions and sensitivities. In the case of the latter, many schools have recently deprecated nicknames that some might consider offensive to [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], a group that has been a traditional inspiration for athletic teams.

==Changes==
* [[Adams State Grizzlies]], formerly the "Indians"
* [[Akron Zips]], called the "Zippers" from 1927 to 1950; this was changed when the term became most associated with the type of [[zipper|clothing fastener]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uakron.edu/about_ua/history/athletics_history_traditions.dot |title=Athletics History &amp; Traditions |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[University of Akron]] |accessdate=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''ESPN College Football Encyclopedia'', p. 74, New York: ESPN Books, 2005, {{ISBN|1-4013-3703-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Army Black Knights]], the current nickname was derived from newspapers calling the team the "Black Knights of the [[Hudson River|Hudson]]" in the 1930s. It was changed from the "Cadets" in 1999. Cadets is still considered an acceptable use, however.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

** [[LSU Tigers and Lady Tigers]]
** [[Texas Tech Red Raiders and Lady Raiders]]

===As a result of a school name change or merger===
* [[Binghamton Bearcats]] - Before adopting its current nickname in 2000, the school now legally known as the State University of New York at Binghamton and branded since 1992 as Binghamton University changed its nickname twice, each time corresponding with a change in the school's name:
** Originally, the school was a satellite of Syracuse University known as Triple Cities College, and had no nickname. When it became independent from Syracuse in 1950, it adopted the name of Harpur College and the nickname "Donkeys".
** When Harpur joined the [[State University of New York]] system in 1965 and adopted its current legal name, the school nickname changed to "Colonials".
* [[Case Western Reserve Spartans]] - Before the schools merged, Case Institute of Technology used the nicknames of the "Scientists" (1918–1938) and the "Rough Riders (1930–1971). Western Reserve was known as the "Pioneers" (1921–1928) and the "Red Cats" (1928–1971).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.case.edu/its/archives/Sports/teams.htm Team Colors, Mascots, Names], Case Western Reserve University, retrieved June 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; While the schools merged in 1967, the undergraduate student bodies (and athletic departments) were separate until 1971, and during the transition, Western Reserve used the athletic identity of its undergraduate arm, Adelbert College.
* [[Cleveland State Vikings]] - Fenn College used the nickname of the "Foxes" until the school was renamed in 1965.
* [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers]] - When Coastal was founded in 1954 as a junior college, the school's nickname was "Trojans". It adopted its current nickname shortly after becoming a part of the University of South Carolina in 1960, due to a desire for a nickname more compatible with the "Gamecocks" of its parent. The nickname remained even after Coastal became an independent institution in 1993. 
* [[Colorado State Rams]] - Colorado A&amp;M used the nickname of the "Aggies".&lt;ref&gt;ESPN, 238.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Connecticut Huskies]] - Connecticut Agricultural College used the nickname "Aggies". The school was renamed Connecticut State College in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uconn.edu/history/yesteryear/archives/academics/ct_agricultural.php Yesteryear Archives: Connecticut Agricultural to UConn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527124204/http://www.uconn.edu/history/yesteryear/archives/academics/ct_agricultural.php |date=2010-05-27 }}, University of Connecticut, retrieved August 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year, the "Huskies" nickname was adopted.
* [[Maryland Terrapins]] - Maryland Agricultural College used the nickname of the "Aggies" and the "Farmers". The school was renamed Maryland State College in 1916 and the University of Maryland in 1920.
* [[Michigan State Spartans]] - Michigan Agricultural College used the nickname of the "Aggies" alongside unofficial nicknames of the "Fighting Farmers" and "Farmers" until 1925.&lt;ref name=espn509/&gt;
* [[Milwaukee Panthers]] - The institution through which the current University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee traces its history, originally the Wisconsin State Normal School and after several name changes [[Wisconsin State College–Milwaukee]], used "Green Gulls" as its nickname until 1956. At that time, it merged with the University of Wisconsin's graduate [[University of Wisconsin–Extension|extension]] campus in Milwaukee to form UW–Milwaukee, with the nickname changing to "Cardinals".
* [[Mississippi State Bulldogs]] - Mississippi A&amp;M changed its nickname from the "Aggies" to the "Maroons" when the school was renamed Mississippi State College in 1932. In 1961, the school was renamed Mississippi State University and the nickname was changed to the "Bulldogs".&lt;ref name=espn542&gt;ESPN, p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[NC State Wolfpack]] - North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (North Carolina A&amp;M) was known as the "Aggies" or "Farmers". The school changed its name to the current North Carolina State University in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsu.edu/installation/NCSUHistory.html NC State History], Chancellor's Installation, North Carolina State University, retrieved May 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[North Georgia Nighthawks]] - In January 2013, [[North Georgia College &amp; State University]], nicknamed "Saints" and "Lady Saints", was merged with [[Gainesville State College]], a two-year technical school with no athletic program, to create the [[University of North Georgia]]. The new school adopted the nickname of "Nighthawks" for all teams.
* [[UMass Lowell River Hawks]] - The University of Lowell, itself the product of a 1971 merger between [[Lowell State College]] and the [[Lowell Technological Institute]], used "Chiefs" as its nickname before it was absorbed into the [[University of Massachusetts]] system in 1991.
* [[Texas–Rio Grande Valley Vaqueros|UTRGV Vaqueros]] - In November 2014, the [[University of Texas Rio Grande Valley]], which began full operation in July 2015 with the merger of the [[University of Texas–Pan American]] (UTPA) and [[University of Texas at Brownsville]], announced that the nickname of the new school would be Vaqueros. The pre-merger UTPA Broncs became the UTRGV athletic program after the merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UT-RGV mascot recommended to be the Vaquero |url=http://www.themonitor.com/news/local/ut-rgv-mascot-colors-announced/article_25556888-6517-11e4-824d-0017a43b2370.html |first=Victoria |last=Brito |newspaper=[[The Monitor (Texas)|The Monitor]] |location=[[McAllen, Texas]] |date=November 5, 2014 |accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maracanã''' ({{lang-pt|Estádio do Maracanã}}, &lt;small&gt;standard [[Brazilian Portuguese]]: &lt;/small&gt;{{IPA-pt|esˈtadʒi.u du maɾakɐˈnɐ̃|}}&lt;small&gt;, local pronunciation: &lt;/small&gt;{{IPA-pt|iʃˈtadʒu du mɐˌɾakɐˈnɐ̃|}}), officially Estádio Jornalista [[Mário Filho]] ({{IPA-pt|iʃˈtadʒ(i)u ʒoʁnaˈliʃtɐ ˈmaɾi.u ˈfiʎu|IPA}}), is a  [[Association football|football]] stadium in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. The stadium is part of a complex that includes an [[arena]] known by the name of [[Ginásio do Maracanãzinho|''Maracanãzinho'']], which means "The Little Maracanã" in Portuguese. Owned by the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro state government]], it is, as is the [[Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro|Maracanã neighborhood]] where it is located, named after the [[Maracanã River (Rio de Janeiro)|Rio Maracanã]], a now canalized river in Rio de Janeiro.

The stadium was opened in 1950 to host the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]], in which Brazil was [[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|beaten 2–1]] by [[Uruguay]] in the deciding game, in front of 199,854 spectators on 16 July 1950.&lt;ref name="rsssfbrasil.com"&gt;http://www.rsssfbrasil.com/miscellaneous/attendances.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The venue has seen attendances of 150,000 or more at 26 occasions, the last being on 29 May 1983, as 155,253 spectators watched [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]] beat [[Santos FC|Santos]] 3-0. The stadium has seen have crowds of more than 100,000 284 times.&lt;ref name="rsssfbrasil.com"/&gt; 
But as [[terrace (stadium)|terraced sections]] have been replaced with seats over time, and after the more or less total renovation for the [[FIFA World Cup 2014]], its original capacity has been reduced to the current 78,838, but remaining as the largest stadium in Brazil. The stadium is mainly used for football matches between the major football clubs in Rio de Janeiro, including [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]], [[Fluminense Football Club|Fluminense]], [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]] and [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]]. It has also hosted a number of concerts and other sporting events.

The total attendance at the last (and indeed decisive game, but not a final) game of the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] was ''199,854'', making it the world's largest stadium by capacity when it was inaugurated. After its 2010–13 renovation, the rebuilt stadium currently seats 78,838 spectators, making it the largest stadium in Brazil and the second in [[South America]] after [[Estadio Monumental "U"|Estadio Monumental]] in [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="maximumcapacityestadão"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maracanã fica mais moderno sem abrir mão de sua história |url=http://www.estadao.com.br/especiais/maracana-fica-mais-moderno-sem-abrir-mao-de-sua-historia,182163.htm |accessdate=22 September 2012 |language=Portuguese |publisher=Estado de S.

The Maracanã was partially rebuilt in preparation for the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]], and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]], for which it hosted several matches, including the final. It also served as the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] and [[2016 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]], with the main track and field events taking place at the [[Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos|Estádio Olímpico]].

==Name==
The official name of the stadium, [[Mário Filho]], was given in honor of an old [[Pernambuco|Pernambucan]] journalist, the brother of [[Nelson Rodrigues]], who was a strong vocal supporter of the construction of the Maracanã.

The stadium's popular name is derived from the [[Maracanã River (Rio de Janeiro)|Maracanã River]], whose point of origin is in the jungle-covered hills to the west, crossing various ''[[bairro]]s'' (neighborhoods) of Rio's ''Zona Norte'' (North Zone), such as [[Tijuca]] and [[São Cristóvão (Rio de Janeiro)|São Cristóvão]], via a drainage canal which features sloping sides constructed of concrete. Upon flowing into the ''Canal do Mangue'', it empties into [[Guanabara Bay]]. The name "''Maracanã''" derives from the indigenous [[Tupi–Guarani languages|Tupi–Guarani]] word for a type of parrot which inhabited the region. The stadium construction was prior to the formation of the later [[Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro|Maracanã neighborhood]], that was once part of Tijuca.

The stadium of [[Red Star Belgrade]], the [[Red Star Stadium]], is popularly called ''Marakana'' in honor of the Brazilian stadium.

==History==

===Construction===
After winning the right to host the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]], the Brazilian government sought to build a new stadium for the tournament. The construction of Maracanã was criticized by [[Carlos Lacerda]], then Congressman and political enemy of the mayor of the city, general Ângelo Mendes de Morais, for the expense and for the chosen location of the stadium, arguing that it should be built in the West Zone neighborhood of [[Jacarepaguá]]. At the time, a tennis stadium stood in the chosen area. Still it was supported by journalist [[Mário Filho]], and Mendes de Morais was able to move the project forward. The competition for the design and construction was opened by the municipality of Rio de Janeiro in 1947, with the construction contract awarded to engineer Humberto Menescal, and the architectural contract awarded to seven Brazilian architects, Michael Feldman, Waldir Ramos, Raphael Galvão, Oscar Valdetaro, Orlando Azevedo, Pedro Paulo Bernardes Bastos, and Antônio Dias Carneiro.&lt;ref name="architects"&gt;{{cite web |title= El fútbol vuelve al histórico Maracanã tras nueve meses de espera |url= http://www.elpais.com.uy/06/01/22/ultmo_197140.asp |accessdate= 20 October 2008 |date= 22 January 2006 |language= Spanish |work= [[El País (Montevideo)|El País]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090109095316/http://www.elpais.com.uy/06/01/22/ultmo_197140.asp |archivedate= 9 January 2009 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first cornerstone was laid at the site of the stadium on 2 August 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soccer Hall: 1950 FIFA World Cup |url=http://national.soccerhall.org/history/WorldCup_1950.htm |accessdate=23 March 2007 |publisher=soccerhall.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330073432/http://national.soccerhall.org/history/WorldCup_1950.htm |archivedate=30 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the first World Cup game scheduled to be played on 24&amp;nbsp;June 1950, this left a little under two years to finish construction. However, work quickly fell behind schedule, prompting FIFA to send Dr. [[Ottorino Barassi]], the head of the Italian FA, who had organized the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934 World Cup]], to help in Rio de Janeiro. A work force of 1,500 constructed the stadium, with an additional 2,000 working in the final months. Despite the stadium having come into use in 1950, the construction was only fully completed in 1965.

=== Opening and 1950 FIFA World Cup ===
[[File:Jogo no Estádio do Maracanã, antes da Copa do Mundo de 1950.tif|thumb|Opening game of the Maracanã Stadium, shortly before the 1950 FIFA World Cup. |195x195px]]
[[File:Selo da Copa de 1950 Cr 1,20.jpg|thumb|right|[[Postage stamp]] featuring the Maracanã, commemorating the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]].|195x195px]]
The opening match of the stadium took place on 16 June 1950. Rio de Janeiro All-Stars beat São Paulo All-Stars 3–1; [[Valdir Pereira|Didi]] became the player to score the first ever goal at the stadium. While the major part of the stadium was finished, it still looked like a construction site; it lacked toilet facilities and a press box. Brazilian officials claimed it could seat over 200,000 people, while the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] estimated it could seat 180,000 and other sources pegged capacity at 155,000. What is beyond dispute is that Maracanã overtook [[Hampden Park]] as the largest stadium in the world.&lt;ref name="Sambafoot"&gt;{{cite web |title= Sambafoot.com: Maracanã, the largest stadium of the world |url= http://www.sambafoot.com/en/articles/30_Maracana_the_largest_stadium_of_the_world_page_1.html |accessdate=23 March 2007 |publisher= Sambafoot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the stadium's unfinished state, FIFA allowed matches to be played at the venue, and on 24 June 1950, the first World Cup match took place, with 81,000 spectators in attendance.

In that first match for which Maracanã had been built, [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] beat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] with a final score 4–0, with [[Ademir Marques de Menezes|Ademir]] becoming the first scorer of a competitive goal at the stadium with his 30th-minute strike. Ademir had two goals in total, plus one each from [[Baltazar (footballer)|Baltasar]] and [[Jair da Rosa Pinto|Jair]]. The match was refereed by Englishman [[George Reader]]. Five of Brazil's six games at the tournament were played at Maracanã (the exception being their 2–2 draw with [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in São Paulo). Eventually, Brazil progressed to the final round, facing [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in the match (part of a round-robin final phase) that turned out to be the tournament-deciding match on 16 July 1950. Brazil only needed a draw to finish as champion, but Uruguay won the game 2–1, shocking and silencing the massive crowd. This defeat on home soil instantly became a significant event in Brazilian history, being known popularly as the ''[[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|Maracanazo]]''. The official attendance of the final game was 199,854, with the actual attendance estimated to be about 210,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Futebol; the Brazilian way of life |url=http://www.ofutebol.com/excerpt.shtml |accessdate=23 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317040832/http://www.ofutebol.com/excerpt.shtml |archivedate=17 March 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sambafoot.com: Maracanã, the largest stadium of the world (part 2) |url=http://www.sambafoot.com/en/articles/30_Maracana_the_largest_stadium_of_the_world_page_2.html |page=2 |accessdate= 23 March 2007 |publisher= sambafoot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In any case, it was the largest crowd ever to see a football game—a record that is highly unlikely to be threatened in an era when most international matches are played in all-seater stadiums. At the time of the World Cup, the stadium was mostly grandstands with no individual seats.

Since the World Cup in 1950, Maracanã Stadium has mainly been used for club games involving four major football clubs in [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]]— [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco]], [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]], [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]] and [[Fluminense Football Club|Fluminense]]. The stadium has also hosted numerous domestic football cup finals, most notably the [[Copa do Brasil]] and the [[Campeonato Carioca]]. On 21 March 1954, a new official attendance record was set in the game between Brazil and [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], after 183,513 spectators entered the stadium with a ticket and 194,603 (177,656 p.) in [[Fla-Flu]] (1963). In 1963, stadium authorities replaced the square goal posts with round ones, but it was still two years before the stadium would be fully completed. In 1965, 17 years after construction began, the stadium was finally finished. In September 1966, upon the death of Mário Rodrigues Filho, the Brazilian journalist, columnist, sports figure, and prominent campaigner who was largely responsible for the stadium originally being built, the administrators of the stadium renamed the stadium after him: ''Estádio Jornalista Mário Rodrigues Filho''. However, the nickname of ''Maracanã'' has continued to be used as the common referent. In 1969, [[Pelé]] scored the 1,000th goal of his career at Maracanã, against [[CR Vasco da Gama]] in front of 65,157 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[Book Almanaque do Santos]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the stadium hosted the games of the final round of the [[1989 Copa America|Copa America]]; in the same year, [[Zico]] scored his final goal for [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]] at the Maracanã, taking his goal tally at the stadium to 333, a record that still stood as of 2011. An upper stand in the stadium collapsed on 19 July 1992, in the second game of the finals of [[1992 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]], between [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]] and [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]], leading to the death of three spectators and injuring 50 others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sports Disasters |url= http://www.emergency-management.net/sport_ev.htm |accessdate=23 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the disaster, the stadium's capacity was greatly reduced as it was converted to an all-seater stadium in the late 1990s. Meanwhile, the ground was classified as a national landmark in 1998, meaning that it could not be demolished.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The stadium hosted the first ever [[2000 FIFA Club World Championship|FIFA Club World Cup final match]] between [[CR Vasco da Gama]] and [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians Paulista]], which Corinthians won on [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalties]].

===21st century, renovations and 2014 FIFA World Cup===
[[Image:Stadion Rio de Janeiro Finale WM 2014 (22117945206).jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Panorama from inside the stadium during the closing ceremony of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]]]
Following its 50th anniversary in 2000, the stadium underwent renovations which would increase its full capacity to around 103,000. After years of planning and nine months of closure between 2005 and 2006, the stadium was reopened in January 2007 with an all-seated capacity of 87,000.

For the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics and Paralympics, a major reconstruction project was initiated in 2010. The original seating bowl, with a two-tier configuration, was demolished, giving way to a new one-tier seating bowl.&lt;ref name="stadiumguide.com"&gt;[http://www.stadiumguide.com/maracana/]&lt;/ref&gt; The original stadium's roof in concrete was removed and replaced with a fiberglass tensioned membrane coated with [[polytetrafluoroethylene|polytetra-fluoroethylene]]. The new roof covers 95% of the seats inside the stadium, unlike the former design, where protection was only afforded to some seats in the upper ring and the bleachers above the gate access of each sector. The old boxes, which were installed at a level above the stands for the [[2000 FIFA Club World Championship]], were dismantled in the reconstruction process. The new seats are colored yellow, blue and white, which combined with the green of the match field, form the Brazilian national colors. In addition, the grayish tone has returned as the main façade color of the stadium.

On 30 May 2013, a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] game between [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[England national football team|England]] scheduled for 2 June was called off by a local judge because of safety concerns related to the stadium. The government of Rio de Janeiro appealed the decision&lt;ref name=BRAxENG/&gt; and the game went ahead as originally planned, the final score being a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref name="BRAxENG"&gt;{{cite news |title= Brazil v England suspended over Maracanã safety concerns |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22725420 |accessdate=30 May 2013 |newspaper=[[BBC Sport]] |date= 30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2334655/Brazil-2-England-2--match-report-Wayne-Rooney-Alex-Oxlade-Chamberlain-wonder-goals-England-great-draw-Maracana-Brazil.html |title= Brazil 2 England 2 |date=2 June 2013 |work=Daily Mail |accessdate= 6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This match marked the reopening of the new Maracanã.&lt;ref name="stadiumguide.com"/&gt;

On 12 June 2014, the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] opened with Brazil defeating Croatia 3–1, but that match was held in São Paulo. The first game of the World Cup to be held in Maracanã was a 2–1 victory by Argentina over Bosnia-Herzegovina on Sunday, 15 June 2014. Host Brazil ended up never playing a match in the Maracanã during the tournament, as they failed to reach the final after [[Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)|being eliminated in the semi-finals]] 7-1 by Germany. In the final, Germany defeated Argentina 1–0 in extra time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2128535-15-biggest-stories-of-the-2014-fifa-world-cup#articles/2128535-15-biggest-stories-of-the-2014-fifa-world-cup/page/13 15 Biggest Stories of the 2014 FIFA World Cup]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disrepair after the 2016 Summer Olympics===
[[File:Estádio Maracanã 1 by Diego Baravelli.jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph of Maracanã's playing field in February 2017]]
The stadium laid dormant in the months after the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics, with photos surfacing in early 2017 of a dried up playing field covered in brown spots and missing turf, ripped-out seats, and damage to windows and doors. A debt of R$3 million ($939,937 USD) to the local energy company led to power being shut off at Maracanã. At the heart of the issue is a legal wrangling between the stadium's owner, operator and the organizing committee for the Rio Olympics over responsibility for maintaining the grounds. Maracanã SA, the operator, charges that the Olympic committee did not return the venue in an acceptable condition, while the committee says the things they need to fix should not keep Maracanã from operating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/01/football/maracana-stadium-rio-2016-olympics/ Why the legendary Maracanã now looks like a ghost stadium]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within six months of the games, daily tours of the stadium were halted due to vandalism at the stadium and violent robberies in the area. Items of value have been looted from the stadium including fire extinguishers, televisions and a bronze bust of journalist [[Mário Filho]], for whom the stadium was named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=CNN|first1=Flora Charner and Shasta Darlington|title=How the Maracanã became a 'ghost' stadium|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/01/football/maracana-stadium-rio-2016-olympics/|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=sport|first1=Guardian|title=Rio Olympic venues already falling into a state of disrepair|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/10/rio-olympic-venues-already-falling-into-a-state-of-disrepair|work=The Guardian|date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New managers ===
On 5 April 2017, the French group [[Lagardère Group|Lagardère]] signed an agreement to administer the Maracanã. In total, Lagardère will invest more than R$500 million by the end of the concession, won by [[Odebrecht]] in 2013 and valid until 2048. The [[Folha de São Paulo]] newspaper informed that the group estimates that it will need to spend about R$15 million on emergency reforms at the stadium. In 2013, the former managers of Odebrecht together with [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG]] and IMX, a company owned by Brazilian billionaire [[Eike Batista]], won the bid to manage the stadium for 35 years. The company was associated with Brazilian building company OAS and the [[Amsterdam Arena]]. At the time, Lagardère was in second place in the bidding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2017/04/1873008-grupo-frances-acerta-compra-da-gestao-do-maracana.shtml?mobile# Grupo francês acerta compra da gestão do Maracanã]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-football events==
The fight [[Masahiko Kimura vs. Hélio Gracie]] between Japanese judoka Masahiko Kimura and Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighter Hélio Gracie was held at the Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro on October 23, 1951.

===Music===
* To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the stadium, on 16 January 1980, [[Frank Sinatra]] performed to a crowd of 175,000.&lt;ref name="tina"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=OW2Ss2GeIrkC&amp;q=Frank+Sinatra+%22175,000%22+guinness&amp;dq=Frank+Sinatra+%22175,000%22+guinness&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipvdji_4vYAhVIuY8KHTeDA5MQ6AEILDAB|title=Guinness Book of World Records 1987|first=Alan|last=Russell|date=1 October 1986|publisher=Sterling|accessdate=15 December 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tina Turner]] and [[Paul McCartney]] made the Guinness Book of World Records with performances at the stadium. Both concerts, in January 1988 ([[Break Every Rule Tour]]) and April 1990 ([[The Paul McCartney World Tour]]), respectively, attracted crowds of over 180,000 people.&lt;ref name="tina"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3865897.html|title=A record 180,000 turn out for Tina|date=18 January 1988|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=50502|title=Arts and Media/Music Feats &amp; Facts/Solo Rock Show Crowd|date=25 May 2006|website=archive.org|accessdate=9 December 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525134623/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=50502|archivedate=25 May 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 18 June 1983, [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] performed for 137,000 fans at the stadium, which marks the record attendance for the band.

'''Maxwell Leo''' "'''Max'''" '''Howell''' [[Officer of the Order of Australia|AO]] (23 July 1927 – 3 February 2014) was an Australian educator and [[rugby union]] player. He played 5 Tests and 27 non-Test games for Australia between 1946 and 1948. He went on to become a physical education teacher and Professor at the [[University of Queensland]]. In 2003 he was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of Australia]] "for service to education as a pioneer in the development of sports studies and sport science as academic disciplines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Wallaby Max Howell dies at 86 after a distinguished career in sports history education|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/rugby/former-wallaby-max-howell-dies-at-86-after-a-distinguished-career-in-sports-history-education/story-fnii0ksb-1226816960095|publisher=couriermail.com.au|accessdate=5 February 2014|date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Rugby Mourns The Passing of Max Howell AO |url=http://www.rugby.com.au/News/NewsArticle/tabid/1699/ArticleID/10798/Default.aspx|publisher=rugby.com.au|accessdate=5 February 2014|date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his career as player he went to North America. Aligned with his sporting exploits, he pursued undergraduate and graduate study in Australia and North America in physical education, education psychology, exercise physiology, and sport history.
He earned doctorate degrees from the University of California at Berkeley(''Facilitation of motor learning by knowledge of performance analysis results'' Ed.D 1954)  and from the University of Stellenbosch, South Africa(''An historical survey of the role of sport in society, with particular reference to Canada since 1700''. PhD 1969) He was also awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree from the University of Alberta, Canada.
During his academic career, Max held teaching and administrative posts at the University of British Columbia, the University of Alberta, San Diego State University, the University of Ottawa, and the University of Queensland.
At Alberta, Max began the graduate program in sport history from which a number of scholars in sport history have graduated, he was Dean of the College of Professional Studies at San Diego State University, and he was the Foundation Chair and first Professor of Human Movement Studies at the University of Queensland. He was renowned for his capacity to stimulate graduate students in the field of sport history and significantly influenced programs in Canada, America, and Australia.
He published articles and books on a range of topics that included physiotherapy, motor learning, exercise physiology, comparative physical education, sport in antiquity, Canadian sport history, the history of sport in Australia, and more recently he wrote about Australian history and produced some fictional works. He is the author of two autobiographical works: ''The shepherd was sleeping: a true story of love and tragedy''. Auckland: Celebrity Books 1998. ''Tragedy and laughter on the road to oblivion: around the final bend,'' North Charleston, SC: CreateSpace, [2013],

He was the President of the North American Society for Sport History (NASSH), President of the Canadian Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation, and President of the Canadian Association of Sport Sciences.
NASSH is honouring him with the annual ''Max and Reet Howell Memorial Address.''&lt;ref&gt;

In [[ice hockey]], a '''penalty shot''' is a type of [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalty]] awarded when a team loses a clear scoring opportunity on a [[Breakaway (hockey)|breakaway]] because of a foul committed by an opposing player. A player from the non-offending team is given an attempt to score a [[Goal (ice hockey)|goal]] without opposition from any defending players except the [[goaltender]].  This is the same type of shot used in a [[Overtime (ice hockey)#Shootout|shootout]] to decide games in some leagues.

==Award==
[[File:SHL referee penalty shot.jpg|thumb|A referee giving the signal for a penalty shot.]]
A penalty shot is awarded to a player who is deemed to have lost a clear scoring chance on a breakaway by way of a penalty infraction by an opposing player.  A breakaway, in this case, means that there are no other players between the would-be shooter and the goaltender of the defending team. Generally, the penalty shot is awarded in lieu of what would normally be a minor penalty, so the fouled team will not get both a penalty shot and a power play from a single infraction, even if they did not score on the former.

According to [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) rules, various infractions during a breakaway that can lead to a penalty shot being awarded include a goaltender deliberately dislodging a goal-post ([[delay of game (ice hockey)|delay of game]]), a defending player using a stick or any other part of his body to interfere with the attacking player, a goaltender or other player throwing his stick to distract or hinder the attacking player, or any other foul committed against the attacking player from behind.  In addition to this, a penalty shot is awarded to the opposing team if a non-goalie player intentionally covers the puck in his own team's goal crease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=NHL
 |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26552
 |title=Table 13 - Rule 25 - Penalty Shot Summary of Penalty Shots
 |accessdate=September 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]] (SPHL), since its inception in 2004, a penalty shot is automatically awarded for a minor penalty in the final two minutes of [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]]. This rule was slightly changed prior to the 2008–09 season when the SPHL changed their overtime rules, shortening minor penalties in overtime to one minute. Now any infraction occurring in the final minute of overtime will result in a penalty shot. This rule only applies to regular season games. {{further|Penalty (ice hockey)}}

Upon observing any of the above scenarios, an [[Official (ice hockey)|official]] will signal a penalty shot by raising his crossed arms above his head with his fists clenched, and then point to centre ice. In the NHL, officials signal a penalty shot by just pointing to centre ice. A player is then picked to take the shot.  This is usually (though not always) the player who was fouled on the preceding play.  In some cases, the [[Captain (ice hockey)|captain]] of the attacking team may pick a player from those on the ice at the time of the infraction.  Only a goaltender or alternate goaltender may be selected to defend the penalty shot, although the original goaltender usually stays in the net.

According to NHL rules, if an infraction which would usually attract a penalty shot occurs while the defending team's goaltender is off the ice (i.e. an empty net scenario), a goal shall be awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=NHL
 |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26308
 |title=Rule 5 - Awarded Goals
 |accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
Following the announcement of the penalty shot, the official places the puck at centre ice.  The identified shooter is allowed to skate a short distance to the puck in order to gain momentum and then, unlike [[Penalty kick (football)|penalty kicks]] in [[Association football|soccer]] and [[penalty stroke]]s in [[field hockey]], the player is allowed to skate with the [[Hockey puck|puck]] before shooting.

[[File:Penalty shot (ice hockey).ogv|thumb|Penalty shot.]]
All players other than the selected shooter and the selected goaltender must move to either side of the ice surface in front of their respective benches.

If a penalty shot is awarded and the penalized team had pulled their goaltender in favour of an [[extra attacker]], the player fouled is  automatically awarded a penalty shot goal, regardless of whether the puck went in.

The goaltender must remain in the [[Hockey rink#Goal area|crease]] until the attacking player has gained possession of the puck.  After this point he may move out of the crease to gain a better defending position. If the goaltender exits the crease prior to the attacker touching the puck, the official allows the play to continue, and any goal scored stands.  If the penalty shot is unsuccessful, however, the puck is returned to centre ice and the shot is re-taken, thus penalizing the goaltender by giving another penalty shot.

During the attempt, the puck must move continuously towards the goal once touched.  A goal may not be scored from a rebound off of the goaltender, the goal itself or the end boards (however, a goal can be scored from a shot which strikes the goal frame or the goaltender and then goes into the net as a result). Once the puck crosses the end line, the attempt is considered over, regardless of whether a shot was taken.

The goaltender may attempt to stop the shot using any means, except throwing his stick or any other object. Should the goaltender throw any object during the attempt, a goal is automatically awarded.

If the penalty shot is successful, the puck is placed at center ice and play resumes as normal.  If the shot is unsuccessful, the puck is placed at either of the faceoff positions in the zone where the play occurred, and play resumes.  The time necessary to complete the penalty shot is not taken off of the game clock.

==Strategy==
[[File:VHK Vsetín v Salith Šumperk 2008-12-21 (1).ogv|thumb|150px|Penalty shot goal]]
Strategy is considered to be very important during penalty shots and [[overtime (ice hockey)|overtime shootouts]] for both the shooter and the goaltender. Both shooters and goaltenders commonly consult their teammates and coaches for advice on the opposing player's style of play. Shooters often consider the goaltender's strengths and weaknesses (such as a fast glove or stick [[Save (ice hockey)|save]]), preferred goaltending style (such as [[Butterfly style|butterfly]] or [[stand-up style|stand-up]]) and method of challenging the shooter. Goaltenders often consider the shooter's shot preference, expected angle of attack, a patented move a shooter commonly uses and even handedness of the shooter.

Most shooters attempt to [[deke (ice hockey)|out-deke]] the goaltender in order to create a better scoring chance. [[Minnesota Wild]] forward [[Mikko Koivu]], [[Detroit Red Wings]] forward [[Pavel Datsyuk]], [[Washington Capitals]] forward [[TJ Oshie]] and [[New York Rangers]] forward [[Martin St. Louis]] are examples of players who commonly use this strategy. However, it is not uncommon for a shooter to simply shoot for an opening without deking. This is commonly referred to as [[list of ice hockey terminology|sniping]]. This is most commonly performed when a goaltender challenges a shooter by giving them an open hole (by keeping a glove, pad or stick out of position or being out of sound goaltending position altogether to tempt the shooter to aim for the given opening).

Very rarely a shooter may take a [[slapshot]] or [[wrist shot]] from the [[point (ice hockey)|point]] or top of the [[slot (ice hockey)|slot]]. This is almost exclusively performed when a shooter either has a high level of confidence in their shot or they attempt to catch the goaltender by surprise. [[Boston Bruins]] forward [[Brian Rolston]], Minnesota Wild forward [[Thomas Vanek]] and [[Philadelphia Flyers]] defenseman [[Chris Pronger]] have all used this strategy with success. In fact, Pronger succeeded in using this strategy in the [[2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2006 Stanley Cup Finals]] against [[Carolina Hurricanes]] goaltender [[Cam Ward]] as a member of the [[Edmonton Oilers]].

Players sometimes use the rarity of point-blank shots as a deking method. [[Sheldon Souray]], owner of one of the hardest slapshots in the NHL, has succeeded by faking a slapshot and simply flipping the puck in. Sometimes a player will even fake a wrist shot by lifting their opposite leg (left leg for a right-handed shooter) or just by flicking their stick directly above the puck. Thomas Vanek also uses this technique.

==History==
[[File:Mike Condon &amp; Ondrej Palat.png|thumb|200px|[[Ondřej Palát]] of the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] (blue) taking a penalty shot against [[Mike Condon (ice hockey)|Mike Condon]] of the [[Montreal Canadiens]] (white).]]
The penalty shot was invented in the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] in the [[1921–22 PCHA season]]. League president [[Frank Patrick (ice hockey)|Frank Patrick]] was fed up with deliberate fouls on players with good scoring opportunities and introduced the free shot. The first shot taken was on December 6, 1921, and the first goal was scored on December 12, 1921 by [[Tom Dunderdale]] on [[Hugh Lehman]]. The shot was taken from one of three dots painted on the ice {{Convert|35|ft}} from the goal. Players had to skate to the dot and shoot the puck from the dot.&lt;ref&gt;Boileau and Wolf 2000, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The penalty shot was added to the rule books of the NHL for the [[1934–35 NHL season|1934–35 season]], allowing them to be awarded when a player was fouled while in "a good scoring position."&lt;ref name="gaz-intro"&gt;{{cite news |work=Montreal Gazette |title=N.H.L. Coaches Are Picking Their Penalty Shot Artists |date=October 20, 1934 |page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first season, the puck was placed in a {{convert|10|ft|adj = on}} circle, {{Convert|38|ft}} from the goalmouth. The player could shoot while stationary within the circle, or could shoot while moving, as long as the shot was taken within the circle.&lt;ref name="gaz-intro" /&gt; The goaltender had to be stationary until the puck was shot, and no more than {{Convert|1|ft}} in front of the goal mouth.&lt;ref name="gaz-intro" /&gt;

The first NHL penalty shot was awarded to the [[Montreal Canadiens]]' [[Armand Mondou]] on November 10, 1934; he was stopped by the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]' [[George Hainsworth]]. On November 13, [[Ralph Bowman|Ralph "Scotty" Bowman]] of the [[St. Louis Eagles]] scored the first penalty shot goal in NHL history. [[Erik Cole]] of the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] became the first NHL player to attempt two penalty shots in one game playing against the Buffalo Sabres and [[Martin Biron]] on November 9, 2005, scoring once. In the Hurricanes' next game Cole was given another penalty shot but missed the net guarded by the [[Florida Panthers]]' [[Roberto Luongo]]. Cole and [[Esa Pirnes]] (October 10 and October 12, 2003) are the only players in the NHL to have taken penalty shots in consecutive games. There have been three occasions when an NHL team successfully converted on two penalty shots in a single game - first on February 11, 1982 when [[Thomas Gradin]] and [[Ivan Hlinka]] of the [[Vancouver Canucks]] scored on shots against [[Detroit Red Wings]] goaltender [[Gilles Gilbert]], second on December 30, 2009 when [[Ryane Clowe]] and [[Joe Thornton]] of the [[San Jose Sharks]] converted penalty shots against [[Washington Capitals]] goalie [[Michal Neuvirth]], and most recently on March 19, 2017 when [[Lukáš Sedlák]] and [[Brandon Dubinsky]] of the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] scored on shots against [[New Jersey Devils]] goaltender [[Cory Schneider]]. On February 6, 2014 [[Max Pacioretty]] of the [[Montreal Canadiens]] was the first player to be awarded two penalty shots in the same period, against the [[Vancouver Canucks]]. He was unsuccessful on both attempts on Roberto Luongo, but still managed to score a hat trick that night. 

The occurrence of a penalty shot being called during regular season overtime in the NHL is a comparative rarity since the institution of a limited, five-minute sudden-death overtime for tie-breaking purposes following the [[2000-01 NHL season]] (the overtime concept for regular season games itself being re-instituted for [[1983–84 NHL season#League business|the 1983-84 season]] onwards), with only three skaters per side in such a period since the [[2015-16 NHL season]]. 

Since then, in Stanley Cup play, 46 penalty shots have been called, and only ten&lt;ref name="duckcup"&gt;{{cite web | title = Anaheim Ducks win Stanley Cup | url = https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/hkn_stanley_cup;_ylt=ApG5xgDzac1UTUZl5PNv2zCs0NUE | accessdate = 2007-06-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060630113935/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/hkn_stanley_cup | archivedate = 2006-06-30 | df =  }} &lt;/ref&gt; in the Final since the first one in NHL play in 1937. The first eight&lt;ref name="duckcup" /&gt; resulted in no score. The first successful penalty shot in NHL Stanley Cup Final history occurred on June 5, 2006, when Chris Pronger of the Edmonton Oilers beat [[Cam Ward]] of the Carolina Hurricanes, following an illegal covering of the puck by Carolina's [[Niclas Wallin]]. {{As of |2010}}, the most recent failed attempt occurred in the 2007 Final, when [[Antoine Vermette]] of the [[Ottawa Senators]] had his shot turned aside by [[Jean-Sébastien Giguère]] of the [[Anaheim Ducks]].

For possibly the first time in professional hockey, a player was awarded two penalty shots on the same play. This occurred on Friday, November 27, 2009 in a game from the [[ECHL]] league between the [[Utah Grizzlies]] and the [[Alaska Aces (ECHL)|Alaska Aces]]. Vladimir Nikiforov of the Utah Grizzlies was pulled down from behind on a breakaway and as the play continued the opposing team knocked the net off of its moorings intentionally. Once the referee stopped play he awarded Nikiforov two shots, with the second being negated if a goal was scored on the first, however the goaltender, [[Scott Reid (ice hockey)|Scott Reid]] stopped both shots.

The '''Prix des Chênes''' is a [[Conditions races|Group 3]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in [[France]] open to two-year-old [[thoroughbred]] [[Colt (horse)|colts]] and [[gelding]]s. It is run at [[Longchamp Racecourse|Longchamp]] over a distance of 1,600 metres (about 1 mile), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.

==History==
The event was originally open to two-year-olds of either gender. It was established in 1882, and was contested over 1,600 metres at Longchamp.

The race was abandoned during World War I, with no running from 1914 to 1919.

Due to World War II, the Prix des Chênes was cancelled in 1939 and 1940. It was held at [[Tremblay Park|Le Tremblay]] in 1943, and was cancelled again in 1944.

The race was cut to 1,400 metres in 1964. It reverted to 1,600 metres in 1966.

The Prix des Chênes left Longchamp after 1988. For brief spells it was staged at [[Saint-Cloud Racecourse|Saint-Cloud]] (1989–90, 1994), [[Évry, Essonne|Évry]] (1991–93) and [[Chantilly Racecourse|Chantilly]] (1995). It returned to Longchamp and was closed to fillies in 1996.

The race formerly served as a trial for the [[Prix Jean-Luc Lagardère|Grand Critérium]]. It is now more usually a trial for the [[Critérium International (horse race)|Critérium International]].

Modern '''rugby union numbering schemes''' normally now have the starting players [[number (sports)|numbered]] from 1 to 15, and the replacements numbered 16 onwards. But [[rugby union]] players have not always been identified by individual labels, nor have the systems used always been the same.

==History of the use of numbers on shirts==
The first use of numbered shirts was the match between [[New Zealand rugby union team|New Zealand]] and [[Queensland Rugby Union|Queensland]] at [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] in 1897&lt;ref name="rugbyfootballhistory.com"&gt;[http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/player_num.htm] Rugby Football History; Player Numbering&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the spectators to identify the players. In that match New Zealand wore the numbers 1 to 15 starting at fullback, while the hosts wore the numbers 16 to 30.

The practice was adopted for various major internationals but no definitive system was adopted.  The matter was brought before the [[International Rugby Board|IRB]] by the [[Rugby Football Union|English]] and [[Welsh Rugby Union|Welsh]] Rugby Unions in 1921 but it was decided that the identification of players by marking their shirts was a matter to be determined by the team themselves.  Most teams used numbers but in the 1930s, the Welsh used letters.  In the early days, a "back-row" was truly a back row, with all three of these players packing down with their shoulders driving the second-row (rather than with the flankers driving the props directly as is usual today). Therefore, in many numbering systems these three players were numbered to reflect that (rather than with the two flankers having consecutive numbers as it is today).

{{rquote|right|''&lt;big&gt;This, Sir, is a rugby match, not a cattle sale.&lt;/big&gt;''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''James Aikman Smith,'''&lt;br&gt;former president of the [[SFU|Scottish Rugby Union]]}}

{{nrut|Scotland}} first adopted a numbering system in 1928 for the match against {{nrut|France}}, but dropped it again immediately.  Thus when Scotland played {{nrut|England}} that year, King [[George V]] who attended the game asked why the Scottish players were not numbered, the former president of the [[Scottish Rugby Union|Scottish Football Union]] (as it was then) [[James Aikman Smith]] answered ''This sir is a rugby match not a cattle sale''.

By the 1950s, the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] had produced a booklet called ''Know the Game'' in which it is stated that ''there are no hard and fast rules governing the names of the positions or the numbers worn'' but it lists the custom in Britain as being 1 for the fullback, to 15 for the lock (now known as the number 8). [[Rugby league]] still uses this ''reverse'' numbering system.

A number of different systems are used to publish team lists in newspapers, match programmes and online. Most list the backs 15–9, followed by the forwards 1–8, although traditionalists prefer 15–9, 1–5, 6,8,7, i.e. the forwards in scrum order. Match programmes often list the players in order from 15 to 1.

By 1950 all the home nations used numbers; England, Scotland and Wales used the system described above, whilst France and Ireland did the reverse using what we would now describe as the modern system. By the 1960/1 season however they had all agreed to use the France/Ireland system, with 1 being loosehead prop and 15 being the fullback.

==Modern numbering==
[[Image:Charlie Beech and Micky Young.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Leicester (green, white and red); the traditional letters denoting their positions can be seen on the front of their shirts above the club badge.]]

There is nothing in the Laws of Rugby Union that determine if or how players should be individually identified by marking their clothing.  However, since 1967, player numbering has been standardised by [[World Rugby]] for international matches (1–15, with 1 being loosehead prop and 15 being the fullback, and the replacements numbered from 16 onwards).  [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English Premiership]] sides have also adopted this standard numbering system to better aid the understanding of spectators new to the sport, thus Leicester have had to abandon their traditional letter system, though they have since reinstated them by printing a small letter appropriate to the player's position next to the club badge on the left breast.&lt;ref&gt;http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m4/may2011/6/2/alesana-tuilagi-pic-getty-749200069.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/ABC-Club-action-Leicester-Tigers-clash-Aussies/story-12082324-detail/story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421082639/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/ABC-Club-action-Leicester-Tigers-clash-Aussies/story-12082324-detail/story.html |archivedate=21 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa, the blindside flanker wears 7 and openside flanker wears 6.

Substitutes are usually numbered as follows:
* 16: hooker
* 17–18: props
* 19: second row
* 20: loose forward
* 21: scrumhalf (or second loose forward)
* 22–23: backs

See [[Rugby union positions]].

==Numbering in seven-a-side rugby==
In [[rugby sevens]], although World Rugby requires that players wear numbers, it does not dictate a specific scheme tied to the player's position. Accordingly, most teams use permanent squad numbering, although numbering generally starts with the forwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/165305.html |title=Eight month tours and Aberavon |first=John |last=Griffiths |work=Ask John |publisher=''ESPN Scrum'' |date=6 June 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptional systems==
[[Image:Starting-An-Attack-.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A painting of the [[England national rugby union team|England]] versus {{nrut|Wales}} rugby match in 1931. Note letters, which are not used any more.]]

Traditionally, some clubs (notably [[Leicester Tigers]] and [[Bristol Rugby|Bristol]]) have used alternative schemes consisting of letters, [[Bath Rugby|Bath]] and [[Richmond F.C.|Richmond]] have used a scheme without a number 13. Other common variations in the numbering are the interchange of 6 and 7 (particularly in South Africa and Argentina) or of 11 and 14. 

Other exceptions include:
* [[West Hartlepool RFC]] hung up their No. 5 jersey in memory of their lock John How who died of a heart condition in a 1994 league match. 
* Waitete Rugby Club (affiliated to the [[King Country Rugby Football Union]] in New Zealand) replace the number 5 with 55, in honour of [[Colin Meads]].
* The rugby team of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]] which used to use a system of ancient Thai numbers,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} making identification by opposing teams virtually impossible. 
* [[Will Greenwood]], who normally played at inside centre, preferred to wear the number 13 shirt rather than the usual number 12 assigned to this position for superstitious reasons.  During the [[2003 Rugby World Cup Final]] he played inside centre wearing number 13 and [[Mike Tindall]] played outside him in the number 12 shirt.

In [[chess]], a '''sacrifice''' is a move giving up a [[Chess piece|piece]] with the objective of gaining tactical or positional [[compensation (chess)|compensation]] in other forms. A sacrifice could also be a deliberate [[Exchange (chess)|exchange]] of a chess piece of higher value for an opponent's piece of lower value.

Any chess piece except the [[king (chess)|king]] may be sacrificed. Because players usually try to hold on to their own pieces, offering a sacrifice can come as an unpleasant surprise to one's opponent, putting him off balance and causing much precious time to be wasted trying to calculate whether the sacrifice is sound or not and whether to accept it. Sacrificing one's [[queen (chess)|queen]] (the most valuable piece), or a string of pieces, adds to the surprise, and such games can be awarded {{chessgloss|brilliancy prizes}}.&lt;ref name='BP1'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E14F73E541B7B93C3A8178FD85F4C8685F9 | title = Chess:; A 23-Move Bind Winds Up With Brilliant Queen Sacrifice | accessdate = 2011-03-07 | last = Horowitz | first = Al | date = December 28, 1967 | work = [[The New York Times]] | publisher = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{algebraic notation|pos=tocleft}}

==Types of sacrifice==

===Real versus sham===
[[Rudolf Spielmann]] proposed a division between sham and real sacrifices:
*In a ''real sacrifice'', the sacrificing player will often have to play on with less {{chessgloss|material}} than his opponent for quite some time.
*In a ''sham sacrifice'', the player offering the sacrifice will soon regain material of the same or greater value, or else force mate.  A sham sacrifice of this latter type is sometimes known as a pseudo sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Spielman, "The Art of Sacrifice in Chess", 1995, Dover, {{ISBN|0-486-28449-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In compensation for a real sacrifice, the player receives dynamic advantages which he must capitalize on, or risk losing the game due to the material deficit.  Because of the risk involved, real sacrifices are also called ''speculative sacrifices''.

====Real sacrifices {{anchor|real sacrifice}}====
'''Attack on the king'''. A player might sacrifice a pawn or piece to get open lines around the vicinity of the opponent's king, to get a {{chessgloss|kingside}} {{chessgloss|space}} advantage, to destroy or damage the opposing king's pawn cover, or to keep the opposing king in the {{chessgloss|center}}.  Unless the opponent manages to fend off the attack, he is likely to lose. The [[Greek gift sacrifice]] is a canonical example.

'''Development'''. It is common to give up a pawn in the [[opening (chess)|opening]] to speed up one's development. [[Gambit]]s typically fall into this category. Developing sacrifices are frequently returned at some point by the opponent before the development edge can turn into a more substantial threat such as a kingside {{chessgloss|attack}}.

'''Strategic/positional'''. In a general sense, the aim of all real sacrifices is to obtain a positional advantage. However, there are some speculative sacrifices where the compensation is in the form of an open file or diagonal or a weakness in the opponent's [[pawn structure]]. These are the hardest sacrifices to make, requiring deep [[chess strategy|strategic]] understanding.

====Sham sacrifices {{anchor|sham sacrifice}}====
'''Checkmate'''. A common benefit of making a sacrifice is to allow the sacrificing player to [[checkmate]] the opponent. Since checkmate is the ultimate goal of chess, the loss of material (see [[Chess piece relative value]]) does not matter in a successful checkmate. Sacrifices leading to checkmate are typically ''forcing'', and often [[check (chess)|check]]s, leaving the opponent with only one or a few options (example, checking the king with the knight, queen takes the knight, then rook checkmates the king with absence on the queen).

'''Avoiding loss'''. The counterpart to the above is saving a lost game. A sacrifice could be made to force [[stalemate]] or [[perpetual check]], to create a [[fortress (chess)|fortress]], or otherwise force a [[draw (chess)|draw]], or to avoid even greater loss of material.

'''Material gain'''. A sacrifice might initiate a combination that results in an overall material gain, making the upfront investment of the sacrifice worthwhile. A sacrifice leading to a pawn [[promotion (chess)|promotion]] is a special case of this type of sacrifice.

'''Simplification'''. Even if the sacrifice leads to net material loss for the foreseeable future, the sacrificing player may benefit because they are already ahead in material and the exchanges simplify the position making it easier to win. A player ahead in material may decide that it is worthwhile to get rid of one of the last effective pieces the opponent has.

The tactical sham sacrifices can be categorized further by the mechanism in why the sacrifice is made. Some sacrifices may fall into more than one category.&lt;ref&gt;This classification scheme was presented by Hans Olav Lahlum in a series of articles in ''Norsk Sjakkblad'', [http://sjakk.no/nsf/norsk_sjakkblad/06_nr2.pdf no. 2 2006] (p. 44), [http://sjakk.no/nsf/norsk_sjakkblad/06_nr3.pdf no. 3 2006] (p. 44), [http://sjakk.no/nsf/norsk_sjakkblad/06_nr4.pdf no. 4 2006] (p. 44), [http://sjakk.no/nsf/norsk_sjakkblad/06_nr5.pdf no. 5 2006] (p. 35), and [http://sjakk.no/nsf/norsk_sjakkblad/06_nr6.pdf no. 6 2006] (p. 31) {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''deflection sacrifices'', the aim is to distract one of the opponent's pieces from a square where it is performing a particular duty.
*In ''destruction sacrifices'', a piece is sacrificed in order to knock away a materially inferior—but tactically more crucial piece—so that the sacrificing player can gain control over the squares the taken chessman controlled.
*A ''magnet sacrifice'' is similar to a deflection sacrifice, but the motivation behind a magnet sacrifice is to pull an opponent's piece to a tactically poor square, rather than pulling it away from a crucial square.
*In a ''clearance sacrifice'', the sacrificing player aims to vacate the square the sacrificed piece stood on, either to open up lines for his own pieces, or to put another, more useful piece on the same square.
*In a ''[[tempo (chess)|tempo]] sacrifice'', the sacrificing player abstains from spending time to prevent the opponent from winning material because the time saved can be used for something even more beneficial, for example pursuing an attack on the king or guiding a passed pawn towards promotion.
*In a ''suicide sacrifice'', the sacrificing player aims to rid himself of the remaining pieces capable of performing legal moves, and thereby obtain a stalemate and a draw from a poor position.

===Other types of sacrifices===

====Forced versus non-forced====
Another way to classify sacrifices is to distinguish between ''forcing'' and ''non-forcing'' sacrifices. The former type leave the opponent with no option but acceptance, typically because not doing so would leave them behind in material with no compensation. Non-forcing sacrifices, on the other hand, give the opponent a choice. A common error is to not recognize when a particular sacrifice can be safely declined with no ill-effects.

Black played '''1... Qxg3?''' and White drew with '''2. Qg8+! Kxg8''' (on any other move Black will get mated) '''3. Rxg7+!'''. White intends to keep checking on the seventh {{chessgloss|rank}}, and if Black ever captures the rook it is stalemate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1252040 Evans vs. Reshevsky, USA 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;

This save from Evans has been dubbed "The [[Swindle (chess)|Swindle]] of the Century".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michess.org/webzine_199907/okeefe.shtml Stalemate!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618041831/http://www.michess.org/webzine_199907/okeefe.shtml |date=18 June 2008 }} Jack O’Keefe, Michigan Chess Association.&lt;/ref&gt;  White's rook is known as a [[desperado (chess)|desperado]].

If Black takes the knight he has to give up his own knight on f6 to avoid mate on h7. Instead, he simply ignored the bait and continued developing.

In this position, Black moves '''22... Qg1+'''  forcing the white rook to take black's queen by '''23. Rxg1''' ; the king cannot take the queen because it would have been in check from the knight on h3.  Having forced the rook out of a position where it was defending the f-file and into a position where it blocked the king from making any move, the black knight delivers a [[smothered mate]] by '''23... Nf2#''' .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1075508|title=chessgames.com|pages=James McConnell vs. Paul Morphy, New Orleans 1849|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1055">The '''shuffle offense''' is an offensive strategy in [[basketball]], developed in the early 1950s by [[Bruce Drake]] at the [[University of Oklahoma]]. It was later used by [[Bob Spear (basketball)|Bob Spear]], who was the first head basketball coach of the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in 1957–71. The shuffle offense has all five players rotate in each of the five shuffle positions. This offense would be an option for a team that has good ball-handlers but is not blessed with height or a strong dominant post player (which may be why Spear used it at Air Force, which has a height restriction).

Coach [[Dean Smith]] of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] also taught the shuffle offense.

The '''Sierra Leone Under-19 cricket team''' represents the country of [[Sierra Leone]] in Under-19 international cricket. Emmanuel Pessima is the all times runs scorer of the Sierra Leone U-19 Cricket Team and also the only Batsman that has given the team over 61 runs not out

Sierra Leone have only competed internationally at Under-19 level for the last couple of years but have already been very successful, qualifying in 2009 for the [[2009 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup Qualifier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketeurope4.net/DATABASE/ARTICLES2/articles/000056/005626.shtml Uganda and Sierra Leone through] cricketeurope4.net 19/02/11&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, due to visa reasons, Sierra Leone were unable to make it to Canada for the event and so missed out on the chance to qualify for the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketeurope4.net/DATABASE/ARTICLES2/articles/000066/006617.shtml Sierra Leone out of Under 19 World Cup Qualifier] cricketeurope4.net 19/02/11&lt;/ref&gt; They are also in a minority of affiliate cricket nations who field an Under-19 side.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1668">{{about|a type of shot in [[cricket]]}}
{{Unreferenced|date=May 2009}}'''Slog''' refers to a type of shot in many forms of [[cricket]] where the [[batsman (cricket)|batsman]] attempts to hit the [[cricket ball|ball]] as far as possible with the aim to hit a [[six (cricket)|six]] or at the least a four. It is an extremely dangerous shot to play since the ball is almost certainly going to be in the air for a long period of time and great technique and power is required from the batsman to actually clear the field.

A slog carries a negative connotation in that it implies power hitting over grace and correct technique.

When playing a 'Slog', a batsman is likely to want to score quickly therefore it is likely to be used in a [[Twenty20]], [[Pro40]] or [[one day cricket|one day]] match. A slog can also be useful in [[test cricket]] if a team has a good lead and needs to [[declaration (cricket)|declare]] so it has as much time as possible to bowl the opposition players out. The slog can be risky. Firstly there is a high possibility of missing the ball with the bat and simply getting [[bowled]]. [[Leg before wicket|LBWs]] are also common when playing the slog but if contact is made there is no guarantee that the ball will simply not loop up to a [[fielding (cricket)|fielder]]. A slog is therefore likely to be played in times of desperation when runs are required extremely quickly or in variations of the game such as 'Plank Cricket' where continuous defensive shots are frowned upon and may even result in disqualification.
Slog sweep is one of the most commonly played cricketing shots.

'''Stadio Pierluigi Penzo''' is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Venice]], [[Italy]].  It is the largest sports facility in Venice and the home ground of [[Venezia F.C.]]. The stadium was first opened in 1913 and takes its name from [[World War I]] pilot Pier Luigi Penzo.&lt;ref name=OfficialSite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veneziaclubs.it/stadio-pierluigi-penzo/|title=Stadio "Pierluigi Penzo"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201054316/http://www.veneziaclubs.it:80/stadio-pierluigi-penzo/|archivedate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally constructed from wood, the stadium was largely upgraded with a concrete main stand in the 1920s and further improvements were made in the decades that followed. The record attendance of 26,000 was for a football match in 1966, a [[Serie A]] match against [[A.C. Milan]].

On 11 September 1970, a tornado hit Venice and caused extensive damage to the stadium. Due to the club's decline the stadium was only partially reinstated, and the capacity was reduced to just over 5,000.&lt;ref name=OfficialSite/&gt; The club rose back up to Serie A in 1998 and additional makeshift stands were added, bringing capacity back up to 13,400, but it has since been reduced again to the current capacity of 7,450.&lt;ref name=StadiumGuide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiumguide.com/pierluigipenzo/|title=Stadio Pierluigi Penzo - Venice - The Stadium Guide|website=www.stadiumguide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is notable as it is primarily accessible by boat.&lt;ref name=StadiumGuide/&gt;

==Plot==
{{More plot|date=April 2015}}
Jimmy Dolan is a college basketball assistant coach who wants to find a new star for his team since he believes this will get him a promotion to head coach at the school. He sees a home video of a prospect named Saleh and travels to [[Africa]] to recruit him. Upon arriving in this continent, Dolan finds himself confronted not only with the challenges of basketball but also with the challenges of adjusting to and learning how to live in the midst of a brand-new culture. Though Dolan is initially opposed by Saleh's father who is also the leader of the village, he later agrees to let his son play. Dolan and Saleh both teach each other life lessons before they take the court for one final game with everything on the line. One of the most dramatic scenes in the film involves the instruction of Saleh by Dolan regarding the "Jimmy Dolan Shake and Bake."
