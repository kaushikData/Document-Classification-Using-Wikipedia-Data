The '''7400 series''' of [[transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL) [[integrated circuit]]s are the most popular [[logic family|family]] of TTL integrated circuit logic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.computerhistory.org/semiconductor/timeline/1963-TTL.html The Computer History Museum, 1963 Standard Logic Families Introduced, retrieved 2008 April 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Lancaster, "TTL Cookbook", Howard W. Sams and Co., Indianapolis, 1975, {{ISBN|0-672-21035-5}}, preface&lt;/ref&gt; Quickly replacing [[diode–transistor logic]], it was used to build the mini and mainframe computers of the 1960s and 1970s. Several generations of [[Pin-compatibility|pin-compatible]] descendants of the original family have since become ''de facto'' standard electronic components.

== Overview ==
The 7400 series contains hundreds of devices that provide everything from basic [[logic gate]]s, [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s, and counters, to special purpose bus transceivers and [[arithmetic logic unit]]s (ALU). Specific functions are described in a [[list of 7400 series integrated circuits]]. Some TTL logic parts were made with an extended military-specification temperature range. These parts are prefixed with '''54''' instead of '''74''' in the part number. A short-lived '''64''' prefix on [[Texas Instruments]] parts indicated an industrial temperature range; this prefix had been dropped from the TI literature by 1973.  Since the 1970s, new product families have been released to replace the original 7400 series. more recent TTL logic families are developed [[CMOS]] or BiCMOS technology rather than TTL.

Today, [[surface-mount]]ed CMOS versions of the 7400 series are used in various applications in electronics and for [[glue logic]] in computers and industrial electronics. The original [[through-hole]] devices in [[dual in-line package]]s (DIP/DIL) were the mainstay of the industry for many decades. They are useful for rapid [[breadboard]]-prototyping and for education and remain available from most manufacturers. The fastest types and very low voltage versions are typically [[surface-mount]] only, however.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=Need citation for surface mount being faster and/or lower voltage}}

The first part number in the series, the 7400, is a 14-pin IC containing four two-input [[NAND gate]]s. Each gate uses two input pins and one output pin, with the remaining two pins being power (+5 V) and ground. This part was made in various through-hole and surface-mount packages, including flat pack and plastic/ceramic dual in-line. Additional characters in a part number identify the package and other variations.

While designed as a family of digital logic, some TTL chips were used in analogue circuits, such as [[Schmitt trigger]]s{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Like the [[4000 series]], the newer [[CMOS]] versions of the 7400 series are also usable as analogue amplifiers using negative feedback (similar to [[operational amplifier]]s with only an inverting input){{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.  However, this type of circuit suffers from significant harmonic distortion and shortened component life.  As the parts are not designed to operate in the partially on/off region except when switching states, heat buildup can be severe{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

=== History ===
Although the 7400 series was the first ''de facto'' industry standard TTL logic family (i.e. second-sourced by several semiconductor companies), there were earlier TTL logic families such as:

The 7400 quad [[NAND gate]] was the first product in the series, introduced by [[Texas Instruments]] in a military grade metal flat package (7400W) in October 1964. The extremely popular commercial grade plastic [[Dual in-line package|DIP]] (7400N) followed in the third quarter of 1966.&lt;ref&gt;http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/texas/ic.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5400 and 7400 series were used in many popular [[minicomputers]] in the 1970s and early 1980s. Some models of the DEC [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]]-series 'minis' used the [[74181]] [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] as the main computing element in the [[Central processing unit|CPU]].  Other examples were the [[Data General Nova]] series and [[Hewlett-Packard]] 21MX, 1000, and 3000 series.

Hobbyists and students equipped with [[wire wrap]] tools, a '[[breadboard]]' and a 5-volt [[power supply]] could also experiment with digital logic referring to how-to articles in [[Byte Magazine|''Byte'' magazine]] and ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' which featured circuit examples in nearly every issue.  In the early days of large-scale IC development, a prototype of a new large-scale integrated circuit might have been developed using TTL chips on several circuit boards, before committing to manufacture of the target device in IC form.  This allowed simulation of the finished product and testing of the logic before the availability of software simulations of integrated circuits.

In 1965, typical quantity-one pricing for the SN5400 (military grade, in ceramic welded [[Flatpack (electronics)|flat-pack]]) was around 22 [[USD]].&lt;ref&gt;

As of 2007, individual commercial-grade chips in molded epoxy (plastic) packages can be purchased for approximately 0.25 USD each, depending on the particular chip.

7400 series parts were constructed using [[bipolar transistor]]s, forming what is referred to as [[transistor–transistor logic]] or '''TTL'''.  Newer series, more or less compatible in function and logic level with the original parts, use [[CMOS]] technology or a combination of the two ([[BiCMOS]]).  Originally the bipolar circuits provided higher speed but consumed more power than the competing [[4000 series]] of CMOS devices.  Bipolar devices are also limited to a fixed power supply voltage, typically 5&amp;nbsp;V, while CMOS parts often support a range of supply voltages.

[[Milspec]]-rated devices for use in extended temperature conditions are available as the 5400 series.  Texas Instruments also manufactured [[radiation-hardened]] devices with the prefix ''RSN'', and the company offered [[beam-lead]] bare dies for integration into hybrid circuits with a ''BL'' prefix designation.

Regular-speed TTL parts were also available for a time in the 6400 series – these had an extended industrial temperature range of −40&amp;nbsp;°C to +85&amp;nbsp;°C.  While companies such as [[Mullard]] listed 6400-series compatible parts in 1970 data sheets,&lt;ref&gt;Mullard FJH 101 Data Sheet, from the Mullard ''FJ Family TTL Integrated Circuits 1970'' databook, retrieved from http://www.datasheetarchive.com/preview/437512.html {{Webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515111834/http://www.datasheetarchive.com/preview/437512.html |date=2016-05-15 }} may 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; by 1973 there was no mention of the 6400 family in the Texas Instruments ''TTL Data Book''.  Some companies have also offered industrial extended temperature range variants using the regular 7400-series part numbers with a prefix or suffix to indicate the temperature grade.

As integrated circuits in the 7400 series were made in different technologies, usually compatibility was retained with the original TTL logic levels and power supply voltages.  An integrated circuit made in CMOS is not a TTL chip, since it uses [[field-effect transistor]]s (FETs) and not bipolar junction transistors, but similar part numbers are retained to identify similar logic functions and electrical (power and I/O voltage) compatibility in the different subfamilies.
Over 40 different logic subfamilies use this standardized part number scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://focus.ti.com/lit/ml/scyb004b/scyb004b.pdf |title=Logic reference guide: Bipolar, BiCMOS, and CMOS Logic Technology |publisher=[[Texas Instruments]] |access-date=2018-07-19 |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}}

Many parts in the CMOS HC, AC, and FC families are also offered in "T" versions (HCT, ACT, and FCT) which have input thresholds that are compatible with both TTL and 3.3&amp;nbsp;V CMOS signals.  The non-T parts have conventional CMOS input thresholds.

The 74H family is the same basic design as the 7400 family with resistor values reduced. This reduced the typical [[propagation delay]] from 9&amp;nbsp;ns to 6&amp;nbsp;ns but increased the power consumption. The 74H family provided a number of unique devices for CPU designs in the 1970s. Many designers of military and aerospace equipment used this family over a long period and as they need exact replacements, this family is still produced by Lansdale Semiconductor.&lt;ref name="LansdaleSemi"&gt;[http://www.lansdale.com Lansdale Semiconductor home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 74S family, using [[Schottky diode|Schottky]] circuitry, uses more power than the 74, but is faster. The 74LS family of ICs is a lower-power version of the 74S family, with slightly higher speed but lower power dissipation than the original 74 family; it became the most popular variant once it was widely available.

The 74F family was introduced by [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] and adopted by other manufacturers; it is faster than the 74, 74LS and 74S families.

Through the late 1980s and 1990s newer versions of this family were introduced to support the lower operating voltages used in newer [[Central processing unit|CPU]] devices.

== Part numbering ==
[[Image:YUNTEN.gif|thumb|right|A 4-bit, 2 register, six-instruction computer made entirely of 74-series chips]]
{{See also|List of 7400-series integrated circuits}}

Part number schemes varied by manufacturer. The part numbers for 7400-series logic devices often use the following designators:

* Often first, a two or three letter prefix, denoting the manufacturer and flow class of the device (e.g. SN for [[Texas Instruments]] using a commercial processing, SNV for Texas Instruments using military processing, M for [[STMicroelectronics|ST Microelectronics]], DM for [[National Semiconductor]], UT for [[Cobham plc|Cobham PLC]], SG for [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]]). These codes are no longer closely associated with a single manufacturer, for example, [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] manufactures parts with MM and DM prefixes, and no prefixes.
* Two digits, where "74" denotes a commercial temperature range device and "54" denotes a military temperature range.  Historically, "64" denoted a short-lived series with an intermediate "industrial" temperature range. 
* No, or up to four letters denoting the logic subfamily (such as "LS", "HCT" or nothing for basic bipolar TTL).
* Two or more arbitrarily assigned digits that identify the function of the device. There are [[List of 7400 series integrated circuits|hundreds of different devices]] in each family.
* Additional suffix letters and numbers may be appended to denote the package type, quality grade, or other information, but this varies widely by manufacturer.

For example, "SN5400N" signifies that the part is a 7400-series IC probably manufactured by [[Texas Instruments]] ("SN" originally meaning "Semiconductor Network"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Robert L. |last2=Miller |first2=John R. |title=Designing with TTL Integrated Circuits |year=1971 |page=15 |url=https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_tiTexasInsSeriesMorrisDesigningWithTTLIntegratedCi_11927910}}&lt;/ref&gt;) using commercial processing, is of the military temperature rating ("54"), and is of the TTL family (absence of a family designator), its function being the ''quad 2-input NAND gate'' ("00") implemented in a plastic through-hole [[Dual in-line package|DIP]] package ("N").

Many [[logic family|logic families]] maintain a consistent use of the device numbers as an aid to designers. Often a part from a different 74x00 subfamily could be substituted ("[[pin-compatibility|drop-in replacement]]") in a circuit, with the same function and [[pin-out]] yet more appropriate characteristics for an application (perhaps speed or power consumption), which was a large part of the appeal of the 74C00 series over the competing [[4000 series|CD4000B]] series, for example.  But there are a few exceptions where incompatibilities (mainly in [[pin-out]]) across the subfamilies occurred, such as:
* some flat-pack devices (e.g. 7400W) and surface-mount devices,
* some of the faster CMOS series (for example 74AC),
* a few low-power TTL devices (e.g. 74L86, 74L9 and 74L95) have a different pin-out than the regular (or even 74LS) series part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:K131la3.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet K131LA3, equivalent to 74H00]]
[[File:Electronic component ttl.jpg|thumb|right|Czechoslovak MH74S00, Texas Instruments SN74S251N, East German DL004D (74LS04), Soviet K155LA13 (7438)]]
[[File:UCY7473.png|thumb|right|Polish UCY7473]]

Some manufacturers, such as Mullard and Siemens, had [[Pin-compatibility|pin-compatible]] TTL parts, but with a completely different numbering scheme; however, data sheets identified the ''7400-compatible'' number as an aid to recognition.

At the time the 7400 series was being made, some European manufacturers (that traditionally followed the [[Pro Electron]] naming convention), such as [[Philips]]/[[Mullard]], produced a series of TTL integrated circuits with part names beginning FJ. Some examples of FJ series are:
* FJH101 (=7430) single 8-input NAND gate,
* FJH131 (=7400) quadruple 2-input NAND gate,
* FJH181 (=7454N or J) 2+2+2+2 input AND-OR-NOT gate.

The [[Soviet Union]] started manufacturing TTL ICs with 7400-series pinout in the late 1960s and early 1970s, such as the K155ЛA3, which was pin-compatible with the 7400 part available in the United States, except for using a metric spacing of 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm between pins instead of the {{convert|0.1|in|mm|2}} pin-to-pin spacing used in the west.&lt;ref name=ussr&gt;{{cite web

Another peculiarity of the Soviet-made 7400 series was the packaging material used in the 1970s–1980s. Instead of the ubiquitous black resin, they had a brownish-green body colour with subtle swirl marks created during the moulding process. It was jokingly referred to in the Eastern Bloc electronics industry as the "elephant-dung packaging", due to its appearance.

The [[Soviet integrated circuit designation]] is different from the Western series:
* the technology modifications were considered different series and were identified by different numbered prefixes – К155 series is equivalent to plain 74, К555 series is 74LS, etc.;
* the function of the unit is described with a two-letter code followed by a number:
** the first letter represents the functional group – logical, triggers, counters, multiplexers, etc.;
** the second letter shows the functional subgroup, making the distinction between logical NAND and NOR, D- and JK-triggers, decimal and binary counters, etc.;
** the number distinguishes variants with different number of inputs or different number of elements within a die – ЛА1/ЛА2/ЛА3 (LA1/LA2/LA3) are 2 four-input / 1 eight-input / 4 two-input NAND elements respectively (equivalent to 7420/7430/7400).
Before July 1974 the two letters from the functional description were inserted after the first digit of the series. Examples: К1ЛБ551 and К155ЛА1 (7420), К1ТМ552 and К155ТМ2 (7474) are the same ICs made at different times.

Clones of the 7400 series were also made in other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries:&lt;ref name=ia6/&gt;
* [[Bulgaria]] (Mikroelektronika [[Botevgrad]]) used a designation somewhat similar to that of the Soviet Union, e.g. ''1ЛБ00ШМ'' (1LB00ShM) for a 74LS00. Some of the two-letter functional groups were borrowed from the Soviet designation, while others differed. Unlike the Soviet scheme, the two or three digit number after the functional group matched the western counterpart. The series followed at the end (i.e. ''ШМ'' for LS). Only the LS series is known to have been manufactured in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* [[Czechoslovakia]] ([[Tesla (Czechoslovak company)|TESLA]]) used the 7400 numbering scheme with manufacturer prefix MH. Example: MH7400.
* [[Poland]] ([[:pl:CEMI|Unitra CEMI]]) used the 7400 numbering scheme with manufacturer prefixes UCA for the 5400 and 6400 series, as well as UCY for the 7400 series. Examples: UCA6400, UCY7400. Note that ICs with the prefix MCY74 correspond to the [[4000 series]] (e.g. MCY74002 corresponds to 4002 and not to 7402).
* [[Hungary]] ([[Tungsram]], later Mikroelektronikai Vállalat / MEV) also used the 7400 numbering scheme, but with manufacturer suffix – 7400 is marked as 7400APC.
* [[Romania]] used trimmed 7400 numbering with own manufacturing prefix CDB. Example: CDB4123E is 74123.
* [[East Germany]] ([[:de:Halbleiterwerk Frankfurt (Oder)|HFO]]) also used trimmed 7400 numbering without manufacturer prefix or suffix. The prefix D (or E) designates digital IC, and not the manufacturer. Example: D174 is 7474. 74LS clones were designated by the prefix DL; e.g. DL000 = 74LS00. In later years East German made clones were also available with standard 74* numbers, usually for export.&lt;ref name=ddr&gt;[https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~heha/basteln/Konsumg%C3%BCter/DDR-Halbleiter/  GDR semiconductor datasheet comparison] {{link language|de}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A specialist form of [[business intelligence]], '''accounting intelligence''' is the general name for the set of technologies used to extract, analyse and present information from accounting and [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] applications such as [[JD Edwards]], [[Oracle E-Business Suite]] or [[SAP AG|SAP]].

==Accounting intelligence compared to business intelligence==
Accounting intelligence differs from standard business intelligence in some key ways:-

* Accounting intelligence applications are specifically designed to analyse data from specific ERP systems. Business intelligence is a more general tool that can be applied to any application that uses a database.
* In an accounting intelligence, there is no staggering of data in a [[data warehouse]] or [[OLAP]] cube. Information is extracted directly from the ERP at the time that a query is run.  A Business Intelligence application typically involves a batch process to extract data from the live database, and store it in a denormalised form. This process is normally referred to as [[extract, transform, load]], or ETL. Typically around 75-80% of the development cost expended when creating a business intelligence system, goes into the design and development of the ETL process.
* Accounting intelligence applications leverage the structure of the chart of accounts and other dimensions, so for example dimension structures can be automatically created based on inbuilt hierarchies, level of detail or account category codes. Time-based functions specifically allow for Year to Date, Cumulative, Period, rolling average and year on year analysis.
* Querying an accounts database directly means the information returned is up to the second real time data.  Discrepancies in the accounts can be corrected and a fresh trial balance, P&amp;L or Balance Sheet viewed immediately. Some aggregation in accounting systems is performed by the ERP when new journal entries are posted, so there is no need to use a cube to aggregate every journal entry from scratch.
* As there is no ETL process, accounting intelligence solutions are typically much simpler to install, implement and maintain than traditional business intelligence solutions. Inquiries and reports typically created by end users rather than software developers.
* Accounting intelligence solutions can make [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|SOX]] compliance easier for many companies, as there is no need to separately audit both the accounts themselves and a separate data warehouse and ETL process.

'''Key advantages compared to business intelligence'''

* Accounting intelligence system ensures that an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is the single source of all operational reporting and analysis, and that it can be relied upon to give accurate and secure information.
* Out of the box solution, much quicker to implement than a standard BI solution.
* As there is no data warehouse, there is no need to separately audit the staged data.
* Data returned is real time, live data, not a snapshot.

'''Key disadvantages compared to business intelligence'''

* Can only be applied to specific ERP systems, such as JDE, Oracle E-Business and SAP.
* Can not integrate data from outside the ERP system.

'''Airline reservation systems''' ('''ARS''') are part of the so-called [[passenger service system]]s (PSS), which are applications supporting the direct contact with the passenger.

ARS eventually evolved into the [[computer reservations system]] (CRS). A computer reservation system is used for the reservations of a particular airline and interfaces with a [[global distribution system]] (GDS) which supports travel agencies and other distribution channels in making reservations for most major airlines in a single system.

== Overview ==
Airline reservation systems incorporate airline schedules, [[fare basis code|fare tariffs]], passenger reservations and ticket records. An airline's direct distribution works within their own reservation system, as well as pushing out information to the GDS. The second type of direct distribution channel are consumers who use the internet or mobile applications to make their own reservations. Travel agencies and other indirect distribution channels access the same GDS as those accessed by the airline reservation systems, and all messaging is transmitted by a standardized messaging system that functions on two types of messaging that transmit on SITA's high level network (HLN). These messaging types are called Type A [usually EDIFACT format] for real time interactive communication and Type B [TTY] for informational and booking type of messages. Message construction standards set by IATA and ICAO, are global, and apply to more than air transportation. Since airline reservation systems are business critical applications, and they are functionally quite complex, the operation of an in-house airline reservation system is relatively expensive.

Prior to deregulation, airlines owned their own reservation systems with travel agents subscribing to them. Today, the GDS are run by independent companies with airlines and travel agencies being major subscribers.

As of February 2009, there are only four major GDS providers in the market: [[Amadeus CRS|Amadeus]], [[Travelport]] (which operates the Apollo, [[Worldspan]] and [[Galileo CRS|Galileo]] systems), [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]] and Shares. There is one major Regional GDS, Abacus, serving the Asian market and a number of regional players serving single countries, including Travelsky (China), [[Infini (CRS)|Infini]] and [[Axess (CRS)|Axess]] (both Japan) and Topas (South Korea).  Of these, Infini is hosted within the Sabre complex, Axess is in the process of moving into a partition within the Worldspan complex, and Topas agencies will be migrating into Amadeus.

Reservation systems may host "ticket-less" airlines and "hybrid" airlines that use [[e-ticket]]ing in addition to ticket-less to accommodate code-shares and [[interline travel|interlines]]. 

In addition to these "standardized" GDS, some airlines have proprietary versions which they use to run their flight operations. A few examples are Delta's OSS and Deltamatic systems and EDS SHARES.  SITA Reservations remains the largest neutral multi-host airline reservations system, with over 100 airlines currently managing inventory.

== Inventory management ==
In the airline industry, available seats are commonly referred to as inventory. The inventory of an airline is generally classified into service classes (e.g. first, business or economy class) and up to 26 [[booking class]]es, for which different prices and booking conditions apply. Inventory data is imported and maintained through a schedule distribution system over standardized interfaces. One of the core functions of inventory management is inventory control. Inventory control steers how many seats are available in the different booking classes, by opening and closing individual booking classes for sale. In combination with the fares and booking conditions stored in the Fare Quote System, the price for each sold seat is determined. In most cases, inventory control has a real time interface to an airline’s [[Yield management]] system to support a permanent optimization of the offered booking classes in response to changes in demand or pricing strategies of a competitor.

== Availability display and reservation (PNR) ==
Users access an airline’s inventory through an availability display. It contains all offered flights for a particular city-pair with their available seats in the different booking classes. This display contains flights which are operated by the airline itself as well as code share flights which are operated in co-operation with another airline. If the city pair is not one on which the airline offers service, it may display a connection using its own flights or display the flights of other airlines. The availability of seats of other airlines is updated through standard industry interfaces. Depending on the type of co-operation, it supports access to the last seat (last seat availability) in real-time. Reservations for individual passengers or groups are stored in a so-called [[passenger name record]] (PNR). Among other data, the PNR contains personal information such as name, contact information or special services requests (SSRs) e.g. for a vegetarian meal, as well as the flights (segments) and issued tickets. Some reservation systems also allow to store customer data in profiles to avoid data re-entry each time a new reservation is made for a known passenger. In addition, most systems have interfaces to CRM systems or customer loyalty applications (aka frequent traveler systems). Before a flight departs, the so-called passenger name list (PNL) is handed over to the departure control system that is used to check-in passengers and baggage. Reservation data such as the number of booked passengers and special service requests is also transferred to flight operations systems, crew management and catering systems. Once a flight has departed, the reservation system is updated with a list of the checked-in passengers (e.g. passengers who had a reservation but did not check in (no shows) and passengers who checked in, but did not have a reservation (go shows)). Finally, data needed for revenue accounting and reporting is handed over to administrative systems.

== Fare quote and ticketing ==
[[File:Airline Fare Chart.png|thumb|alt=Table of Airline Fares|List of fares for travel on [[Delta Air Lines]] from San Francisco, CA to Boston, MA.  Applicable booking classes, as well as specific restrictions such as minimum stay and advance purchase can be seen.]]
The Fares data store contains fare tariffs, rule sets, routing maps, class of service tables, and some tax information that construct the price&amp;nbsp;– "the fare". Rules like booking conditions (e.g. minimum stay, advance purchase, etc.) are tailored differently between different city pairs or zones, and assigned a class of service corresponding to its appropriate inventory bucket. Inventory control can also be manipulated manually through the availability feeds, dynamically controlling how many seats are offered for a particular price by opening and closing particular classes.

The compiled set of fare conditions is called a [[fare basis code]]. There are two systems set up for the interchange of fares data&amp;nbsp;— [[Airline Tariff Publishing Company|ATPCO]] and SITA, plus some system to system direct connects. This system distributes the fare tariffs and rule sets to all GDSs and other subscribers. Every airline employs staff who code air fare rules in accordance with yield management intent. There are also revenue managers who watch fares as they are filed into the public tariffs and make competitive recommendations. Inventory control is typically manipulated from here, using availability feeds to open and close classes of service.

The role of the ticketing complex is to issue and store electronic ticket records and the very small number of paper tickets that are still issued. Miscellaneous charges order (MCO) is still a paper document; IATA has working groups defining the replacement document the electronic multipurpose document (EMD) as at 2010. The electronic ticket information is stored in a database containing the data that historically was printed on a paper ticket including items such as the ticket number, the fare and tax components of the ticket price or exchange rate information. In the past, airlines issued paper tickets; since 2008, IATA has been supporting a resolution to move to 100% electronic ticketing. So far, the industry has not been able to comply due to various technological and international limitations. The industry is at 98% electronic ticket issuance today, although electronic processing for MCOs was not available in time for the IATA mandate.

== History ==
[[File:Magnetronic Reservisor.jpg|thumb|Agent set of the Magnetronic Reservisor system]]

Until the 1950s, airline reservations used manual systems at centralized reservation centers, which consisted of groups of people in a room with physical cards that represented inventory, in this case, seats on airplanes. In the late 1950s, [[American Airlines]] wanted a system that would allow real-time access to flight details in all of its offices, and the integration and automation of its booking and ticketing processes. It introduced an electronic reservations system, [[Reservisor|Magnetronic Reservisor]], in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnetronic Reservisor|url=http://airchive.com/html/museums/american-airlines-cr-smith-museum-ft-worth-texas/1950s-magentronic-reservisor-reservations-machine/845|publisher=American Airlines C.R. Smith Museum|accessdate=3 August 2014|quote=The Magnetronic Reservisor, introduced in 1952, was the first electronic reservations system in the airline industry}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, it developed the [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]] (Semi-Automated Business Research Environment). Sabre's breakthrough was its ability to keep inventory correct in real time, accessible to [[travel agent|agents]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt; {{ cite web | url = https://scottscheapflights.com/resources/history/how-sabre-changed-airline-reservations/ | title = How Sabre Changed Airline Reservations | work = Scott's Cheap Flights | accessdate = July 24, 2017 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[deregulation]] of the airline industry, in the [[Airline Deregulation Act]], meant that airlines, which had previously operated under government-set fares ensuring airlines at least broke even, now needed to improve efficiency to compete in a [[free market]].  In this deregulated environment, the ARS and its descendants became vital to the travel industry.

}}

A '''bagel machine''' is a machine that automatically produces [[Bagel|bagels]]. It rolls, presses, and shapes dough into perfect circles.

== History ==
In 1950, [[Daniel Thompson (inventor)|Daniel Thompson,]] son of Mickey Thompson, began designing an automatic bagel-making machine when he was 29. His father had been trying to make a working automatic bagel-making machine for most of his life to advance his baking business,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-daniel-thompson-20150920-story.html|title=Daniel Thompson dies at 94; his invention made bagel a household word|last=Woo|first=Elaine|date=2015-09-19|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;and Daniel was following in his footsteps.  

In 1958, Daniel Thompson started construction of the first successful automatic bagel-making machine in his garage in [[Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles]]. He called it “The Thompson Bagel Machine”. A few years later, he patented his design. One year later, in 1961, he and his wife established the "Thompson Bagel Machine Manufacturing Corporation".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/09/22/daniel-thompson-who-brought-bagels-to-the-masses-but-miffed-purists-dead-at-94/|title=The inventor who revolutionized and maybe ruined the bagel, dead at 94|last=Kaplan|first=Sarah|date=2015-09-22|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years after he started construction of the bagel machine, he leased the successful and perfected design to [[Murray Lender]], who owned a family-run bagel-making business.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The first automated bagel-making machines were introduced to [[New Haven, Connecticut]], [[Buffalo, New York]], and [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in 1963, producing between 200 and 400 bagels per hour. The largest machines could produce as many as 5,000 bagels in an hour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bagels had very quickly become extremely popular and were in an abundance supermarkets and restaurants because of Daniel Thompson’s bagel making machine. The price of the bagel has dropped significantly because they are now being mass produced everywhere in the world.

== Impact ==
Before Thompson's automatic bagel-making machine was invented, making bagels was a slow process. Very few bakers actually made them. After the automatic bagel machine was invented, many more bagels were  produced and the bagel became much more common. The automatic bagel-making machine popularized the bagel, leading to it being featured in many supermarkets and restaurants around the world. Today, far more bagels are being produced than ever before.

== Use and features ==
The bagel machine automatically mass creates bagels by rolling the bagels, shaping the bagels, and pressing the bagels until they are a circular shape.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Banktivity, formerly known as iBank is a personal finance management suite designed for macOS and iOS platforms by IGG Software and debuted in 2003 as a Mac desktop software. There have been a total of 6 releases for the desktop version since its inception. Over this same period, [[IGG Software|IGG Software Inc.]] also released iOS versions for the iPhone (2009) and the iPad (2012) and Apple Watch. Features differ between the apps, specifically the lack of reporting on the iPhone version.

In February 2016 IGG Software officially dropped the iBank name and rebranded as Banktivity. The name was derived from "Bank" and "Activity"according to IGG Software's president Ian Gillespie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mactrast.com/2016/02/igg-software-renames-popular-ibank-personal-finance-app-to-banktivity/|title=IGG Software Renames Popular 'iBank' Personal Finance App to 'Banktivity'|date=3 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by [[Forbes]], [[Macworld|MacWorld]], [[MacLife]] Magazine, Endgadet and others, Banktivity is considered in the Mac user community as viable alternative to Quicken for Mac.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/2097965/ibank-5-review-personal-finance-mac-app-corners-the-market-on-your-money.html|title=iBank 5 review: Personal finance Mac app corners the market on your money|work=Macworld|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertberger/2017/10/15/5-much-better-alternatives-to-quicken-and-mint/#10fc0ca729c5|title=5 Much Better Alternatives To Quicken And Mint|last=Berger|first=Rob|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.reformer.com/stories/playing-with-the-big-boys,194311|title=Playing with the big boys|work=The Brattleboro Reformer|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=39IDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA59&amp;lpg=RA1-PA59&amp;dq=igg+software#v=onepage&amp;q=igg%20software&amp;f=false|title=Mac Life|last=Inc|first=Future US|date=November 2008|publisher=[[Future US, Inc.]]|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://machow2.com/best-personal-finance-software-mac/|title=10 Best Quicken Alternatives For Mac|date=2014-05-01|work=MacHow2|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/02/20/igg-software-ibank-and-its-climb-from-one-man-shop-to-intuit-co/|title=IGG Software, iBank and its climb from one-man shop to Intuit competitor|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ben Hibon''' is a Swiss animation director. Hibon was born in Geneva, Switzerland, where he completed studies in Fine Art. He moved to London in 1996 to study Graphic Design at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, followed by a master's degree at the same school.

Hibon created in-game sequences for the [[Capcom|Capcom's]] 2005 video game ''[[Killer7]]''. He also designed and directed a segment for ''[[Tokyo Zombie]]'', a Japanese horror film written and directed by the infamous Sakichi Sato.

Hibon's short film ''[[Codehunters]]'' premiered at the MTV Asia Awards 2006 held in Bangkok, Thailand. Since its release, ''Codehunters'' has been shown in more than 50 festivals all around the world, and received nominations at the Raindance Film Festival and the Rushes Shorts Festival. It won a gold award for Best Animation at the Promax/BDA Asia awards in 2006, the Imagina Award 07 for best short film, a D&amp;AD Nomination for Animation, and most recently the highly coveted Golden Nica award at the Prix Ars Electronica 2007.

In early 2007, Sony PlayStation commissioned Hibon to create and direct an animated series inspired by their flagship [[PlayStation 3]] game ''[[Heavenly Sword]]''. The episodes, made available weekly as a lead-up to the game's release, are also featured on the game disc as extras.

Hibon assisted [[David Yates]] in directing the animated short of ''The Tale of The Three Brothers'' in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1]]''. He is currently lined up to direct ''Pan'', a dark contemporary version of the story of ''Peter Pan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=29549|title=Ben Hibon Handling Pan|work=empireonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bitwalk''' (formerly "Bitwalking" until 2018) is a [[digital currency]] introduced by project founders, Franky Imbesi and Nissan Bahar.&lt;ref name="BBC ref 01"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Volpicelli, Gian|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3331865/These-boots-EARNING-Crypto-currency-app-Bitwalking-tracks-steps-pays-people-stroll-around.html#ixzz3smwrDC3Q|title=Bitwalking app tracks your steps and rewards you for getting fit &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online|publisher=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=2015-12-01|date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each Bitwalking dollar (BW$) is earned by walking approximately 10,000 steps, or 5 miles (8&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Simmons, Dan|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34872563|title=Bitwalking dollars: Digital currency pays people to walk - BBC News|publisher=bbc.com|accessdate=2015-12-01|date=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While each BW$ will be equivalent to $1 in the Bitwalking online store, the real-world conversation rate of each BW$ is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Wilson, Mark|title=Earn yourself spendable Bitwalking dollars with your daily perambulations|url=http://betanews.com/2015/11/21/earn-yourself-spendable-bitwalking-dollars-with-your-daily-perambulations/|website=BetaNews|accessdate=4 December 2015|date=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A free [[mobile app]]lication is used to count and convert a user's steps into Bitwalking dollars.&lt;ref name="BBC ref 01" /&gt; The Bitwalking dollars generated by the app accumulate daily in the user's account until transferred or spent. The app is available on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices and in a limited number of countries including the [[UK]], [[Japan]], [[Malawi]], and [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mathews, Lee|title=Bitwalking is digital currency you earn just by walking|url=http://www.geek.com/mobile/bitwalking-is-digital-currency-you-earn-just-by-walking-1640125/|website=Geek|accessdate=4 December 2015|date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of Bitwalking dollars a user can claim  per day was capped at 3BW$ at launch.&lt;ref name="BBC ref 01" /&gt; Bitwalking dollars can't now be spent neither in the Bitwalking in-app marketplace nor exchanged for cash, but the company have stated future plans to set up an automatic online exchange.&lt;ref name="BBC ref 01" /&gt;

The mobile app is currently not available for Android and iOS devices until further notice, as the staff is working hard on the next generation of Bitwalking.

Bitwalk currently has one major competitor in the space, Sweatcoin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sweatcoin.club|title=Sweatcoin App|last=Club|first=Sweatcoin|date=|website=|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is available for both iPhone and Android and can be used in the US, UK, Canada, Ireland and Australia.

'''Blis Technologies''' Limited is a [[biotechnology]] company that manufactures advanced [[probiotics]] for the mouth and throat.&lt;ref name=stuff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/68789679/blis-technologies-positive-on-sales-ahead|title=Blis Technologies positive on sales ahead|first1=Alan|last1=Wood|date=22 May 2015|access-date=20 June 2018|publisher=Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company's founder, John Tagg, has conducted research investigating the amount of bacteria present within a diet and their effects on personal hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10542787|title=From tooth decay to body odour, professor claims bacteria can beat the bugs|publisher=The New Zealand Herald|first1=Angela|last1=Gregory|date=13 November 2008|access-date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After contracting [[rheumatic fever]] at age 12, Tagg later decided, as a young microbiology student, to seek an effective way of countering the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=John|last1=Gibb|date=19 December 2013|access-date=20 June 2018|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/funding-rheumatic-fever-fight|title=Funding for rheumatic fever|publisher=Otago Daily Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2000, he left his academic position at the [[University of Otago]] to launch Blis Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.otago.ac.nz/profiles/otago004042.html|title=Professor John Tagg Interview|publisher=University of Otago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later the first oral probiotic – ''ThroatGuard'', containing BLISK12 – was marketed. A wide variety of products have been subsequently developed, with many now sold internationally in lozenges, gum, power and other forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0211/S00172.htm|title=Blis announce launch of new products|publisher=Scoop Media|date=21 November 2002|access-date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blis' products have been sold globally&lt;ref name=stuff /&gt;, while the company itself is headquartered in [[Dunedin, New Zealand]]. Blis Technologies is publicly listed on the [[New Zealand Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzx.com/instruments/BLT|title=BLT|publisher=NZX|access-date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and Innovation==

Blis Technologies hold the world-first patent for their strain of the oral bacteria, Streptococcus salivarius, claimed to be beneficial for humans, which won the 2010 Frost &amp; Sullivan award for Global Entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nbr.co.nz/article/blis-technologies-wins-international-award-122366|title=Blis Technologies Wins International Award|publisher=The National Business Review|first1=Niko|last1=Kloeten|date=30 April 2010|access-date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was also acknowledged by multinational [[Deloitte]] as the ''Fastest Growing Mature Business'' in [[New Zealand]] for 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.deloitteprivate.co.nz/fast50/2016/company/blis-technologies-limited/|title=NZ Fast 50, Blis Technologies, ranked 22|publisher= Deloitte Private}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent Developments==
A secondary product to ThroatGuard, containing BLIS K12 in a powder form suitable for children and infants, was developed and branded ''ToddlerProtect''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-harold-katz/probiotics-_b_2877882.html|title= Recent Studies Show Benefits of BLIS K12 Probiotic|publisher= The Huffington Post|first1=Harold|last1=Katz|date=19 March 2013|access-date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third product was later rolled in 2006, ''TravelGuard'', suitable for travelers exposed to airborne germs.

In September 2005, Blis announced the launch of ''FreshBreath'', aimed with promoting and maintaining fresher breath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/beat-bad-breath-keep-mouth-bacteria-happy/|title=Beat bad breath, keep mouth bacteria happy|publisher= Scientific American|first1=Deborah|last1=Franklin|access-date=20 June 2018|date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blis Technologies introduced a new probiotic to the New Zealand market in October 2012, focused on fighting the bacteria associated with tooth decay and periodontal disease. The BLIS M18 (Streptococcis salivarius) strain was developed and launched into the market under the brand name ''HealthyTeeth''. Several clinical trials found BLIS M18 to promote the health of the oral cavity.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In 2011, Blis K12 received [[GRAS]] (generally recognised as safe) status from the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]], enabling the [[probiotic]] to be used as a food additive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/business/178489/blis-k12-fda-certification-opens-way-global-launch |title=Blis K12 FDA certification opens way for global launch|publisher=Otago Daily Times|first1=Sally|last1=Rae|access-date=20 June 2018|date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bus lane''' or '''bus-only lane''' is a [[lane]] restricted to [[bus]]es, often on certain days and times, and generally used to speed up [[public transport]] that would be otherwise held up by [[traffic congestion]]. Bus lanes are a key component of a high-quality [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) network, improving bus travel speeds and reliability by reducing delay caused by other traffic.

A dedicated bus lane may occupy only part of a roadway which also has lanes serving general automotive traffic; the related term '''busway''' describes a roadway completely dedicated for use by buses.

==History==
The world's first designated bus lane was created in [[Chicago]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apta.com/research/stats/history/mileston.cfm Milestones in U.S. Public Transportation History] (from the [[American Public Transportation Association|APTA]] website. Retrieved 6 December 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/ntd.htm History of the NTD and Transit in the US] (from the [[National Transit Database|NTD]] website. Retrieved 6 December 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first bus lanes in Europe were established in 1963 in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Hamburg]], when the [[Trams in Hamburg|tram system]] was closed and the former segrated tram tracks were converted for bus travel. Other large German cities soon followed, and the implementation of bus lanes was officially sanctioned in the German highway code in 1970. Many experts from other countries ([[Japan]] among the first) studied the German example and implemented similar solutions. On 15 January 1964 the first bus lane in France was designated along the ''quai du Louvre'' in [[Paris]] and the first [[contraflow lane]] was established on the old ''pont de l’Alma'' on 15 June 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amtuir.org/06_htu_bus_100_ans/oa_1961_1970/oa_1961_1970.htm ''Les zones bleues et les couloirs pour autobus''] (from the [[AMTUIR]] website, Musée des Transports Urbains. Retrieved 6 December 2007.{{fr_icon}})&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February 1968 the first bus lane in [[London]] was put into service on [[Vauxhall Bridge]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The first contraflow bus lane in the UK was introduced in King's Road, [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] as a temporary measure when the road was made one-way (eastwards to Cemetery Junction) on 16 June 1968. The initial reason was to save the expense of rerouting the [[trolleybus]], which was due to be scrapped on 3 November of that year. However the experiment proved so successful that it was made permanent for use by motor buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/15th-august-1969/39/when-mrs-barbara-castle-in-her-role-of-minister-of|title=WHEN Mrs. Barbara Castle, in her role of Minister of - 15th August 1969 - The Commercial Motor Archive|website=archive.commercialmotor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1972 there were over {{convert|140|km}} of with-flow bus lanes in 100 cities within [[OECD]] member countries, and the network grew substantially in the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3927/is_199912/ai_n8873097/pg_2 ''Assessing travel time impacts of measures to enhance bus operations''] - Jepson, D.; Ferreira, L., ''Road &amp; Transport Research'', December 1999. Retrieved 6 December 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[El Monte Busway]] between El Monte and Downtown [[Los Angeles]] was the first dedicated busway in the US, constructed in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtc.ca.gov/library/blueprint/bp_rapidbus.htm Los Angeles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611191716/http://www.mtc.ca.gov/library/blueprint/bp_rapidbus.htm |date=11 June 2007 }} (from the [[Metropolitan Transportation Commission (San Francisco Bay Area)|San Francisco Metropolitan Transportation Commission]] website. Retrieved 6 December 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Bus lanes may be located in different locations on a street, such as on the sides of a street near the curb, or down the center. They may be long, continuous networks, or short segments used to allow buses to bypass bottlenecks or reduce route complexity, such as in a contraflow bus lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nacto.org/publication/transit-street-design-guide/transit-lanes-transitways/transit-lanes/|title=Transit Lanes - National Association of City Transportation Officials|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bus lanes may be demarcated in several ways. Descriptive text such as "BUS LANE" may be marked prominently on the road surface, particularly at the beginning and end. Some cities use a diamond-shaped pavement marking to indicate an exclusive bus lane. The road surface may have a distinctive color, usually red, which has been shown to reduce prohibited vehicles from entering bus lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nacto.org/publication/transit-street-design-guide/transit-lanes-transitways/lane-elements/pavement-markings-color/|title=Pavement Markings &amp; Color - National Association of City Transportation Officials|newspaper=National Association of City Transportation Officials|language=en-US|access-date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Road sign]]s may communicate when a bus lane is in effect.

Bus lanes may also be physically separated from other traffic using bollards, curbs, or other raised elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nacto.org/publication/transit-street-design-guide/transit-lanes-transitways/lane-elements/separation-elements/|title=Separation Elements - National Association of City Transportation Officials|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cities, such as [[The Hague]] in the Netherlands, buses are allowed to use reserved [[tramway track|tram tracks]], usually laid in the middle of the road and raised slightly above the road surface.

== Operation ==
Bus lanes may have separate sets of dedicated [[traffic signals]], to allow [[Traffic-light signalling and operation|transit signal priority]] at intersections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nacto.org/publication/transit-street-design-guide/intersections/signals-operations/|title=Signals &amp; Operations - National Association of City Transportation Officials|newspaper=National Association of City Transportation Officials|language=en-US|access-date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peak-only bus lanes are enforced only at certain times of the day, usually during [[rush hour]], reverting to a general purpose or parking lane at other times. Peak-only bus lanes may be in effect only in the main direction of travel, such as towards a downtown during morning rush hour traffic, with the buses using general purpose lanes in the other direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nacto.org/publication/transit-street-design-guide/transit-lanes-transitways/transit-lanes/peak-bus-lane/|title=Peak-Only Bus Lane - National Association of City Transportation Officials|newspaper=National Association of City Transportation Officials|language=en-US|access-date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entire streets can be designated as bus lanes (such as [[Oxford Street]] in London, [[Princes Street]] in Edinburgh, or Fulton Street in Downtown Brooklyn), allowing buses, taxis and delivery vehicles only, or a contra-flow bus lane can allow buses to travel in the opposite direction to other vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Highwaycode/Signsandmarkings/index.htm|title=Signs Giving Orders|work=[[Highway Code]]|accessdate=10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some locations allow bicyclists or taxis to use bus lanes, however where bus or bicycle volumes are high, mixed traffic operations may result in uncomfortable conditions or delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nacto.org/publication/transit-street-design-guide/transit-lanes-transitways/transit-lanes/shared-bus-bike-lane/|title=Shared Bus-Bike Lane - National Association of City Transportation Officials|newspaper=National Association of City Transportation Officials|language=en-US|access-date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain other vehicles may also be permitted in bus lanes, such as [[taxicab|taxis]], [[high occupancy vehicle]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, or [[bicycle]]s. [[Police]], [[ambulance service]]s and [[fire brigade]]s can also use these lanes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tpm/tal/trafficmanagement/trafficadvisoryleaflet207 The Use of Bus Lanes by Motorcycles] (from Traffic Advisory Leaflet 2/07, [[Department for Transport]], United Kingdom) {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808120139/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tpm/tal/trafficmanagement/trafficadvisoryleaflet207|date=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands mixed bus/cycle lanes are uncommon. According to the Sustainable Safety guidelines they would violate the principle of homogeneity and put road users of very different masses and speed behaviour into the same lane, which is generally discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/sustainable-safety/|title=Sustainable Safety|date=2 January 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
Bus lanes can become ineffective if weak enforcement allows use by unauthorized vehicles&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10404011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10404011 |title=1779 cheats spotted in single morning using bus lanes |author=McNaughton, Maggie |date=3 October 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[parking violation|illegal parking]].

Evidence from the operation of urban arterials in [[Brisbane, Australia]] shows that a properly enforced bus lane, operating as designed without interference, can substantially increase passenger throughput. In 2009 and 2010 traffic surveys showed that in Brisbane on a number of urban arterials with Bus and Transit lanes, non-compliance rates were approaching 90%. Following enhanced enforcement of the lanes, non-compliance rates dropped and overall efficiency of the Bus and Transit lanes improved with an up to 12% increase in total passenger throughput in the lane. Average bus journey times dropped, in some cases, by up to 19%.&lt;ref&gt;Lyndon, S. Marinelli, P.A. Macintosh, K. and McKenzie, S.

Some cities, including San Francisco and New York, employ automated camera enforcement, using either stationary cameras adjacent to the bus lane, or cameras on the front of buses to automatically issue citations to vehicles obstructing the bus lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfmta.com/services/permits-citations/camera-enforcement|title=Red Light Camera and Other Automated Enforcement|date=2 May 2013|work=SFMTA|access-date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/1286/bus-lane-camera-violations|title=Bus Lane Camera Violations|work=NYC 311|access-date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Bus lanes give priority to buses, cutting down on journey times where roads are congested with other traffic and increasing the reliability of buses. The introduction of bus lanes can significantly assist in the reduction of [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airquality.co.uk/reports/cat05/1004010934_MeasurementvsEmissionsTrends.pdf |accessdate=14 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807100412/http://www.airquality.co.uk/reports/cat05/1004010934_MeasurementvsEmissionsTrends.pdf |archivedate=7 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bus lanes marked with colored pavement have been shown to reduce intrusions into bus lanes, speeding travel time and increasing bus reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/agendaitems/2015/6-2-15%20Item%2012%20%20Church%20St.%20Rapid%20Pilot%20-%20Final%20Report_1.pdf|title=Church Street Transit Lanes Final Report|last=San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency|first=|date=February 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The busiest bus lane in the United States is the [[Lincoln Tunnel XBL]] (exclusive bus lane) along the [[Lincoln Tunnel Approach and Helix]] in [[Hudson County, New Jersey]], which carries approximately 700 buses per hour during morning peak times an average of one bus every 5.1 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arctunnel.com/about/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913022242/http://www.arctunnel.com/about/|date=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[Cross Harbour Tunnel]] in [[Hong Kong]] carries 14,500 buses per day,&lt;ref&gt;http://gia.info.gov.hk/general/201003/03/P201003030140_0140_62651.doc&lt;/ref&gt; or an average of about 605 an hour all day (not just peak times), but the bus lane must give way to all the other road users resulting in long queues of buses.{{elucidate|date=June 2015}}

==Criticism==
The installation of bus lanes requires additional space to either be constructed (increasing the impact of the road on the surrounding area, and possibly requiring [[eminent domain|taking of private land]]),&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10428321"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10428321 |title=Transport plan will force homes and businesses to move |author=Dearnaley, Mathew |date=12 March 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or space must be taken from existing lanes, reduce the space available for private vehicles.

The '''Chinese Furniture Museum''' ({{zh|c=中國家具博物館|p=Zhōngguó Jiājù Bówùguǎn}}) or '''China's Furniture Museum'''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tycg.gov.tw/site/index.aspx?site_id=123&amp;site_content_sn=469 |title=Taoyuan County Government - China's Furniture Museum |publisher=Tycg.gov.tw |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[museum]] in [[Taoyuan District]], [[Taoyuan City]], [[Taiwan]]. The museum's purpose is to continue and promote the culture of traditional [[Chinese furniture]] and to coordinate with the forest resources of Taoyuan City and the quality traditional furniture craftsmanship of [[Daxi District]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==History==
The idea for the museum was originally established by the suggestion of the Minister of [[Ministry of Culture (Republic of China)|Council for Cultural Affairs]] [[Chen Chi-lu]] after an inspection tour around Taiwan in 1984 to visit all of the cultural centers around the island.&lt;ref name="tyccc.gov.tw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyccc.gov.tw/englishweb/info7/ch/chinese.asp#01|title=:::The Chinese Furniture Museum-Department of Cultural Affairs,Taoyaun:::|work=tyccc.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the museum started in September 1996 in three phases due to budget considerations. The phase one construction mainly focused on the special exhibitions of traditional Chinese furniture and furniture made in [[Daxi District|Daxi]]. The phase two construction focused on the furniture in early Taiwanese life and the traditional art furniture making. And the phase three construction focused on the peripheral facilities to the museum and space for research. All of the construction works were completed in December 1992.

==Architecture==
The museum is located on the basement level inside the Cultural Affairs Bureau of [[Taoyuan City Government]] occupying an area of 900 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superspace.moc.gov.tw/en/local_culture_page.asp?rid=247 |title=文化部-地方文化館 |publisher=Superspace.moc.gov.tw |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyccc.gov.tw/englishweb/info7/ch/chinese.asp |title=:::The Chinese Furniture Museum-Cultural Affairs Bureau Taoyuan County Government::: |publisher=Tyccc.gov.tw |date=1996-09-30 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==

'''Clarence Frank Birdseye II''' (December 9, 1886 – October 7, 1956) was an [[People of the United States|American]] [[inventor]], [[entrepreneur]], and naturalist, and is considered to be the founder of the modern [[frozen food]] industry.

== Early life and Education ==
Clarence Birdseye was the sixth of nine children of Clarence Frank Birdseye, a lawyer in an insurance firm, and Ada Jane Underwood.&lt;ref name="Kurlansky"&gt;{{cite book | title=Birdseye : The Adventures of a Curious Man | publisher=Doubleday | last=Kurlansky | first=Mark | year=2012 | edition=1st | location=New York | isbn=0385527055}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first years were spent in [[Brooklyn]], New York, where his family owned a townhouse in Cobble Hill. From childhood, Birdseye was obsessed with natural science and with [[Taxidermy]], which he taught himself by correspondence. At the age of eleven he advertised his courses in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24551578 | work=BBC News | title=Are people snobbish about frozen food? | date=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blfrfood.htm|title=The History of Frozen Foods - Clarence Birdseye|publisher=Inventors.about.com|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/birdseye_hi.html|title=Who Made America? - Innovators - Clarence Birdseye|publisher=Pbs.org|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was fourteen, the family moved to the suburb of [[Montclair, New Jersey]], where Birdseye graduated from  [[Montclair High School (New Jersey)|Montclair High School]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last = Mattern | first =  Joanne | title = Clarence Birdseye: Frozen Food Innovator | publisher = ABDO Publishing Company | year = 2011 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CyJ3AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He matriculated at [[Amherst College]], where his father and elder brother had earned degrees. There he excelled at science, although an average student in other subjects. His obsession with collecting insects led his college classmates to nickname him "Bugs". This was subsequently changed to "Bob". Birdseye's biographer, Mark Kurlansky notes that after 1906, he was never again referred to as Clarence.&lt;ref&gt;Kurlansky, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the summer after his freshman year Birdseye worked for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] in [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]] as an “assistant naturalist”, at a time when the agency was concerned with helping farmers and ranchers get rid of predators, chiefly coyotes.&lt;ref name="Maslin"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/26/books/mark-kurlanskys-birdseye-the-adventures-of-a-curious-man.html?nl=books&amp;emc=booksupdateemb11_20120427&amp;pagewanted=all |title=The Inventor Who Put Frozen Peas on Our Tables |date=April 25, 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Janet Maslin}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1908 the Birdseye family experienced a financial crisis "of an unclear nature,"&lt;ref&gt;Kurlansky, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in Birdseye's having to withdraw from college after completing only two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Kelly| first = Mike | title = Clarence Birdseye In Labrador| publisher = The Consecrated Eminence: blog of The Archives &amp; Special Collections at Amherst College | year = 2013 | url = https://consecratedeminence.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/clarence-birdseye-in-labrador/ | accessdate= 19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years later, in 1917, both Birdseye's father and elder brother, Kellogg, were charged and convicted in a scheme to defraud the firm for which they worked, and were sentenced to prison. It is not known whether this event was connected to the difficulties that had forced Birdseye to leave Amherst. 

After leaving college, Birdseye was once again hired by the [[United States Agriculture Department]], this time for a project surveying animals in the American West. He also worked with entomologist Willard Van Orsdel King (1888-1970)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first1=Tom |title=Chilled: How Refrigeration Changed the World and Might Do So Again |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2015 |isbn=978-1472911421 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Montana, where, in 1910 and 1911, he captured several hundred small mammals from which King removed several thousand ticks for research, isolating them as the cause of [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], a notable breakthrough. 
Birdseye's next field assignment, intermittently from 1912 to 1915, was in [[Labrador]] in the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] (now part of [[Canada]]), where he became further interested in food preservation by freezing, especially fast freezing. He purchased land at [[Muddy Bay]] where he built a ranch for raising foxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lXecCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Encounters: An Anthropological History of Southeastern Labrador|last=Kennedy|first=John C.|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|year=2015|isbn=9780773583443|location=Montreal and Kingston|pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taught by the [[Inuit]] how to [[ice fishing|ice fish]] under very thick ice. In -40&amp;nbsp;°C weather, he discovered that the fish he caught froze almost instantly, and when thawed, tasted fresh. He recognized immediately that the frozen seafood sold in [[New York (state)|New York]] was of lower quality than the frozen fish of Labrador. He saw that this knowledge would be lucrative. His journals from this period, which meticulously record these observations, are held in the Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College.

Conventional freezing methods of the time were commonly done at higher temperatures, thus the freezing occurred much more slowly, giving ice crystals more time to grow. It is now known that fast freezing produces smaller ice crystals, which cause less damage to the tissue structure. When 'slow' frozen foods thaw, cellular fluids leak from the ice crystal-damaged tissue, giving the resulting food a mushy or dry consistency upon preparation. Birdseye solved this problem. 

In 1922, Birdseye conducted fish-freezing experiments at the Clothel Refrigerating Company, and then established his own company, Birdseye Seafoods Inc., to freeze fish fillets with chilled air at -43&amp;nbsp;°C (-45&amp;nbsp;°F). In 1924, his company went bankrupt for lack of consumer interest in the product. That same year he developed an entirely new process for commercially viable [[Flash freezing|quick-freezing]]: packing fish in cartons, then freezing the contents between two refrigerated surfaces under pressure. Birdseye created General Seafood Corporation to promote this method.

==Industrial development==
In 1925, General Seafood Corporation moved to [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]]. There it employed Birdseye's newest invention, the double belt freezer, in which cold brine chilled a pair of stainless steel belts carrying packaged fish, freezing the fish quickly. His invention was issued US Patent #1,773,079, marking the beginning of today's frozen foods industry.&lt;ref&gt;Birdseye, Clarence. (12 August 1930). Method of preparing food products. U.S. Patent No. 1,773,079. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;/ref&gt; Birdseye patented other machinery which cooled even more quickly. In 1927, he extended the process to quick-freezing meat, poultry, fruit, and vegetables.

In 1929, Birdseye sold his company and [[patent]]s for $22 million to [[Goldman Sachs]] and the [[Post Cereals|Postum Company]], which eventually became [[General Foods Corporation]], which founded the [[Birds Eye]] Frozen Food Company. Birdseye continued to work with the company, further developing frozen food technology. In 1930, the company began sales experiments in 18 retail stores around [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], to test consumer acceptance of quick-frozen foods. The initial product line featured 26 items, including 18 cuts of frozen meat, spinach and peas, a variety of fruits and berries, blue point oysters, and fish fillets. Consumers liked the new products, and today this is considered the birth of retail frozen foods. The "Birds Eye" name remains a leading frozen-food brand. Birdseye was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/staff-blog/2005/02/11/clarence_birdseye_hall_of_famer.html|title=Clarence Birdseye: Hall of Famer|last=|first=|date=2005-02-11|work=Inc.com|access-date=2017-09-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929065103/https://www.inc.com/staff%2Dblog/2005/02/11/clarence_birdseye_hall_of_famer.html|archive-date=2011-09-29|dead-url=yes|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Birdseye died on October 7, 1956, of a [[heart attack]] at the [[Gramercy Park Hotel]]. He was 69 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Clarence Birdseye Is Dead at 69.

A '''computer reservation system''' or '''central reservation system'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaweb.net/global-distribution-systems/central-reservation-system.html |title=Central Reservation System &amp;#124; Online Hotel Marketing Services, Hong Kong and Philippines Hotel, Spa and Restaurant Software |publisher=Iaweb.net |date=2010-07-06 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''CRS''') is a [[computer]]ized system used to store and retrieve information and conduct transactions related to [[air travel]], [[hotel]]s, [[car rental]], or other activities. Originally designed and operated by airlines, CRSs were later extended for the use of [[travel agency|travel agencies]]. [[Global distribution system]]s (GDS) book and sell tickets for multiple airlines. Most airlines have [[outsource]]d their CRSs to GDS companies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The ineluctable middlemen |url= http://www.economist.com/node/21560866 |newspaper=The Economist |date=25 August 2012 |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also enable consumer access through [[Internet]] gateways. Modern GDS's typically allow users to book hotel rooms, rental cars, airline tickets as well as other activities and tours. They also provide access to railway reservations and bus reservations in some markets, although these are not always integrated with the main system. These are also used to relay computerized information for users in the hotel industry, making reservation and ensuring that the hotel is not overbooked. 

[[Airline reservations system]]s may be integrated into a larger [[passenger service system]], which also includes an airline inventory system and a [[departure control system]].

==History==

===Origins===
In 1946, [[American Airlines]] installed the first automated booking system, the experimental [[electromechanical]] [[Reservisor]]. A newer machine with temporary storage based on a [[magnetic drum]], the Magnetronic Reservisor, soon followed. This system proved successful, and was soon being used by several airlines, as well as [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton Hotels]] and [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] for [[inventory]] control. It was seriously hampered by the need for local human operators to do the actual lookups; ticketing agents would have to call a booking office, whose operators would direct a small team operating the Reservisor and then read the results over the telephone. There was no way for agents to directly query the system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The [[MARS (ticket reservation system)|MARS-1]] train ticket reservation system was designed and planned in the 1950s by the [[Japanese National Railways]]' R&amp;D Institute, now the [[Railway Technical Research Institute]], with the system eventually being produced by [[Hitachi]] in 1958.&lt;ref name="mars1"&gt;[http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/dawn/0030.html 【Hitachi and Japanese National Railways】 MARS-1], [[Information Processing Society of Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the world's first seat reservation system for trains.&lt;ref name="dawn"&gt;[http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/dawn/history.html Early Computers: Brief History], [[Information Processing Society of Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt; The MARS-1 was capable of reserving seat positions, and was controlled by a [[transistor computer]] with a [[central processing unit]] and a 400,000-bit magnetic drum memory unit to hold seating files. It used many [[Processor register|registers]], to indicate whether seats in a train were vacant or reserved to accelerate searches of and updates to seat patterns, for communications with terminals, printing reservation notices, and [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays.&lt;ref name="mars1"/&gt;

===Remote access===
In 1953, [[Trans-Canada Airlines]] (TCA) started investigating a computer-based system with remote [[Computer terminal|terminals]], testing one design on the [[University of Toronto]]'s [[Manchester Mark 1]] machine that summer. Though successful, the researchers found that input and output was a major problem. [[Ferranti Canada]] became involved in the project and suggested a new system using [[punched card]]s and a [[transistor]]ized computer in place of the unreliable [[Vacuum tube|tube]]-based Mark I. The resulting system, [[ReserVec]], started operation in 1962, and took over all booking operations in January 1963. Terminals were placed in all of TCA's ticketing offices, allowing all queries and bookings to complete in about one second with no remote operators needed.

In 1953, American Airlines [[chief executive officer|CEO]] [[C. R. Smith]] chanced to sit next to R. Blair Smith, a senior [[IBM]] sales representative, on a flight from Los Angeles to New York. C.R. invited Blair to visit their Reservisor system and look for ways that IBM could improve the system. Blair alerted [[Thomas Watson, Jr.|Thomas Watson Jr.]] that American was interested in a major collaboration, and a series of low-level studies started. Their idea of an automated [[airline reservations system|airline reservation system]] (ARS) resulted in a 1959 venture known as the [[Sabre (computer system)|Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment]] (SABRE), launched the following year.&lt;ref&gt;R. Blair Smith, OH 34. Oral history interview by Robina Mapstone, May 1980. Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. http://www.cbi.umn.edu/oh/display.phtml?id=9&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the network was completed in December 1964, it was the largest civil [[data processing]] system in the world.

Other airlines  established their own systems. [[Pan American World Airways]] launched its [[PANAMAC]] system in 1964. [[Delta Air Lines]] launched the [[Delta Automated Travel Account System]] (DATAS) in 1968. [[United Airlines]] and [[Trans World Airlines]] followed in 1971 with the [[Apollo Reservation System]] and [[Programmed Airline Reservation System]] (PARS), respectively. Soon, travel agents began pushing for a system that could automate their side of the process by accessing the various ARSes directly to make reservations. Fearful this would place too much power in the hands of agents, American Airlines executive [[Robert Crandall]] proposed creating an industry-wide computer reservation system to be a central clearing house for U.S. travel; other airlines demurred, citing fear of [[United States antitrust law|antitrust prosecution]].

===Travel agent access===
In 1976, United began offering its Apollo system to travel agents; while it would not allow the agents to book tickets on United's competitors, the marketing value of the convenient terminal proved indispensable. SABRE, PARS, and DATAS were soon released to travel agents as well. Following [[Airline Deregulation Act|airline deregulation]] in 1978, an efficient CRS proved particularly important; by some counts, [[Texas Air]] executive [[Frank Lorenzo]] purchased money-losing [[Eastern Air Lines]] specifically to gain control of its SystemOne CRS.

Also in 1976 [[Videcom international]] with [[British Airways]], [[British Caledonian]] and CCL launched [[Travicom]], the world's first multi-access reservations system (wholly based on Videcom technology), forming a network providing distribution for initially two and subsequently 49 subscribing international airlines (including British Airways, British Caledonian, [[TWA]], [[Pan American World Airways]], [[Qantas]], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Air France]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Scandinavian Airlines System|SAS]], [[Air Canada]], [[KLM]], [[Alitalia]], [[Cathay Pacific]] and [[Japan Airlines|JAL]]) to thousands of travel agents in the UK. It allowed agents and airlines to communicate via a common distribution language and network, handling 97% of UK airline business trade bookings by 1987. The system went on to be replicated by Videcom in other areas of the world including the Middle East (DMARS), New Zealand, Kuwait (KMARS), Ireland, Caribbean, United States and Hong Kong. Travicom was a trading name for Travel Automation Services Ltd.   When BA (who by then owned 100% of Travel Automation Services Ltd) chose to participate in the development of the Galileo system Travicom changed its trading name to Galileo UK and a migration process was put in place to move agencies from Travicom to Galileo.

European airlines also began to invest in the field in the 1980s initially by deploying their own reservation systems in their homeland, propelled by growth in demand for travel as well as technological advances which allowed GDSes to offer ever-increasing services and searching power. In 1987, a consortium led by Air France and West Germany's Lufthansa developed [[Amadeus (computer system)|Amadeus]], modeled on SystemOne. Amadeus Global Travel Distribution was launched in 1992. In 1990, Delta, [[Northwest Airlines]], and Trans World Airlines formed [[Worldspan]], and in 1993, another consortium (including British Airways, KLM, and [[United Airlines]], among others) formed the competing company [[Galileo CRS|Galileo International]] based on Apollo. Numerous smaller companies such as [[KIU System (CRS&amp;GDS)|KIU]] have also formed, aimed at niche markets not catered for by the four largest networks, including the [[low-cost carrier]] segment, and small and medium size domestic and regional airlines.

*Sabre Holdings was purchased by private investors [[Silver Lake Partners]] and [[Texas Pacific Group]] on March 30, 2007, for about US$5 billion.  Full year 2008 Sabre Holdings revenues were about US$3 billion.
*In December 2006, [[Travelport]], which owns Galileo, agreed to buy and merge with the [[Worldspan]] GDS. The combined company would then control a 46.3% market share using 2002 airline booking data.
*Worldspan's market share is 16.9% globally and 31% in the U.S. according to 2006 [[MIDT]] airline transaction data.
*In March 2007, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines switched from its own reservations system (CORDA) to Amadeus as a result of the merger with Air France.
*In February 2010, JetBlue converted its reservation system over to the SabreSonic Customer Sales and Service platform.

==Trends==
For many years the GDSs had a dominant position in the travel industry. To bypass the GDS and avoid high GDS fees, airlines have started to distribute flights directly from their websites.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Michael (2010): Value Creation in Travel Distribution, https://www.amazon.com/dp/0557612462&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility to bypass the GDS are direct connections to the Travel Agencies. [[American Airlines]]' direct connects are a prominent example of this development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://directconnect.aa.com/Default.aspx |title=American Airlines - Direct Connect |publisher=Directconnect.aa.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|right|Digital egg timer.jpg|120|Egg timer.jpg|60|Digital egg timer with animated falling sand|Egg timer of the traditional hourglass type}} 

An '''egg timer''' or '''kitchen timer''' is a device the primary function of which is to assist in timing during cooking; the name comes from the first timers initially being used for the timing of cooking [[Egg (food)|eggs]]. Early designs simply counted down for a specific period of time. Some modern designs can time more accurately by depending on water temperature rather than an absolute time.

==Technology==

Traditionally egg timers were small [[hourglass]]es&lt;ref name="telegraph prince"&gt;{{cite news|last=Prince|first=Rose|title=Christmas wish lists: Hamish Anderson, Richard Corrigan, Skye Gyngell, Rose Prince, Sophie Dahl, Sir Terence Conran, Sam and Sam Clark and Yotam Ottolenghi|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinkpicturegalleries/6709505/Christmas-wish-lists-Hamish-Anderson-Richard-Corrigan-Skye-Gyngell-Rose-Prince-Sophie-Dahl-Sir-Terence-Conran-Sam-and-Sam-Clark-and-Yotam-Ottolenghi.html?image=3|accessdate=3 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name has come to be synonymous with this form. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} As technology progressed [[clockwork|mechanical]] countdown timers were developed which had an adjustable dial and could be applied to a wide range of timed cooking tasks. Most recently [[Timer#Digital Timers|digital timers]] have also been manufactured and a wide selection of software is available to perform this task on a computer or mobile phone. The task is simple to perform on most microwaves and oven timers.
[[File:Kitchen timer.jpg|thumb|120|Mechanical clockwork egg/kitchen timer]]
New products have been developed which potentially allow for better egg timing; these use the temperature of the water in which the eggs are being cooked to indicate the cooking state of the eggs. This kind of timer has the potential to more accurately indicate the state of the egg while it is being cooked as they do not rely on certain conditions (water hardness, hob temperature, atmospheric pressure).
[[File:Mechanical egg timer internals.jpg|thumb||120|Clockwork mechanism of a mechanical egg timer.]]
One such product is made of translucent plastic with a heat-sensitive coloured disc in the middle which changes colour at {{convert|80|C|F|lk=in}}. The plastic around the disc changes temperature relatively steadily and gradually from the outside to the inside of the plastic mimicking how an egg heats up while cooking. This allows an observer to see the colour creep inwards through the disc and stop the boiling at the stage required. As it mimics the boiling of an egg, it will be accurate even if the boiling process is disrupted, a lower temperature is used and regardless of the quantity of eggs being cooked.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://ergonomics.about.com/od/buyingguide/fr/egg_perfect.htm Egg-Perfect Egg Timer Ergonomic Review] About.com review.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other similar products use electronics to sense the water temperature and play a certain tune or series of beeps to indicate the state of the eggs.

Eggs consist of [[Ovalbumin|protein]]s which [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] when heat is applied. They lose their shape and become long strands rather than tight masses. They then tangle with each other causing the liquid of the egg to become more and more [[Viscosity|viscous]].

Most traditional egg timers have a set time of about three minutes, that being the approximate time it takes to [[cooking|cook]] an average sized [[chicken|hen's]] [[egg (food)|egg]] in water. Hard-boiled eggs take longer to cook.  The three minute egg timer is for soft-[[boiled eggs]].
&lt;ref name="Herbst"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[The New Food Lover's Companion]]| last=Herbst| first=Sharon Tyler| authorlink=Sharon Tyler Herbst| year=2001| publisher=Barron's Educational Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The egg changes rapidly during the first few minutes of cooking.  The changes cannot be seen through the [[eggshell]], so timing is important.

==Memo Park Timer==
Countdown timers not specifically for eggs are also available for general kitchen and timing use. The clockwork Memo Park Timer had a countdown of up to 60 minutes and was sold attached to a [[keyring]], its original purpose being to remind motorists when their [[parking meter]] was due to expire.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Gareth; Pallister, David. ''Timer clue to Brighton bombing'', [[The Guardian]]; 10 May 10 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''electric dragbike''' is an [[Electric motorcycles and scooters|electric motorcycle]] used for [[drag racing]].

Electric dragsters have come of age with new developments in [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and motor technology. Electric motors powered by lithium cells can deliver power-to-weight ratios similar to high performance [[gasoline engine]]s. Drag races last around ten seconds so battery range is not an issue. A number of electric dragbikes and [[electric dragster|dragsters]] (cars) are competing with [[Top Fuel]] classes.  Electric drag racing records are listed at [[NEDRA]].&lt;ref name="nedrarecord"&gt;[http://www.nedra.com/record_holders.html Record Holders] ''Nedra''. Retrieved: 17 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Batteries==
Electric dragbike tend to use [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] or [[Nickel-metal hydride battery|nickel-metal hydride]] cells due to their higher energy density which means they are less bulky to carry. In addition fewer cells are needed compared to a car as the "payload" of bike and rider is lighter. Typical weights: {{Convert|80|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} rider, {{Convert|200|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} bike excluding battery weight.

A '''food truck''' is a large vehicle equipped to cook and sell food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/food-truck | title=food truck | publisher=Oxford Dictionaries | accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some, including [[ice cream truck]]s, sell frozen or prepackaged food; others have on-board kitchens and prepare food from scratch. Sandwiches, hamburgers, french fries, and other regional fast food fare is common. In recent years, associated with the [[pop-up restaurant]] phenomenon, food trucks offering gourmet cuisine and a variety of specialties and ethnic menus, have become particularly popular.&lt;ref name=lempert&gt;{{cite web | url=http://supermarketnews.com/viewpoints/evolution-time-food-trucks-1025/ | title=Evolution: The Time for Food Trucks Has Arrived! | publisher=Supermarket News | date=25 October 2010 | accessdate=21 February 2015 | author=Lempert, Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food trucks, along with portable [[food booth]]s and [[food cart]]s, are on the front line of the [[street food]] industry that serves an estimated 2.5 billion people every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9781138023680/|title=Street Food: Culture, Economy, Health and Governance|publisher=Routledge|editor1-last=De Cássia Vieira Cardoso|editor1-first=Ryzia|editor2=Michèle Companion|editor3=Stefano Roberto Marras|year=2014|isbn=9781138023680}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="faobn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spotlight: School Children, Street Food and Micronutrient Deficiencies in Tanzania |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |location=Rome, Italy |date=February 2007 |url=http://www.fao.org/AG/magazine/0702sp1.htm |accessdate=2008-02-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZgB8eh79?url=http://www.fao.org/AG/magazine/0702sp1.htm |archivedate=2015-06-30 |df= }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the United States, the Texas [[chuckwagon]] is a precursor to the American food truck. In the later 1800s, herding cattle from the Southwest to markets in the North and East kept cowhands on the trail for months at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Bill|title=American Chuck Wagon Association|url=http://americanchuckwagon.org/chuck-wagon-history.html|accessdate=2014-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, the "father of the Texas Panhandle", [[Charles Goodnight]],&lt;ref&gt;In the Driftway. (1928). [Article]. Nation, 126(3281), 589-590.&lt;/ref&gt; a Texas cattle rancher, fitted a sturdy old [[United States Army]] wagon with interior shelving and drawers, and stocked it with kitchenware, food and medical supplies. Food consisted of dried beans, coffee, cornmeal, greasy cloth-wrapped bacon, salt pork, beef, usually dried or salted or smoked, and other easy to preserve food stuffs. The wagon was also stocked with a water barrel and a sling to kindle wood to heat and cook food.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, P. (1996). Camping it up. [Article]. Texas Monthly, 24(9), 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.history.com/news/hungry-history/from-chuck-wagons-to-pushcarts-the-history-of-the-food-truck | title=From Chuck Wagons to Pushcarts: The History of the Food Truck | publisher=HISTORY.com (A&amp;E Television Networks) | date=August 8, 2014 | accessdate=13 December 2014 | author=Butler, Stephanie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early relative of the modern food truck is the lunch wagon, as conceived by food vendor Walter Scott in 1872. Scott cut windows in a small covered wagon, parked it in front of a newspaper office in Providence Rhode Island, and sold sandwiches, pies and coffee to pressmen and journalists. By the 1880s, former lunch-counter boy, Thomas H. Buckley, was manufacturing lunch wagons in Worcester, Massachusetts. He introduced various models, like the Owl and the White House Cafe, with features that included sinks, refrigerators and cooking stoves, also colored windows and other ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/who-made-that-food-truck.html | title=Who Made That Food Truck? | publisher=''New York Times' | date=May 2, 2014 | accessdate=13 December 2014 | author=Engber, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later versions of the food truck were mobile [[canteen (place)|canteens]], which were created in the late 1950s. These mobile [[canteen (place)|canteens]] were authorized by the U.S. Army and operated on stateside army bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/chron2b/1957b.html |title=1957 |publisher=Redstone.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114043901/http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/chron2b/1957b.html |archivedate=January 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile food trucks, nicknamed "roach coaches" or "gut trucks", have been around for years, serving construction sites, factories, and other [[blue-collar]] locations.&lt;ref name="nymag"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nymag.com/shopping/features/58998/ | title=Intentionally Temporary | publisher=''New York Magazine'' | date=23 September 2009 | accessdate=18 February 2015 | author=Urstadt, Bryant}}&lt;/ref&gt; In big cities of the U.S. the food truck traditionally provided a means for the on-the-go person to grab a quick bite at a low cost. Food trucks are not only sought out for their affordability but as well for their nostalgia; and their popularity continues to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study identifies factors that contribute to food trucks' fast spread|url=http://ns.umich.edu/new/releases/22337-study-identifies-factors-that-contribute-to-food-trucks-fast-spread|website=Michigan News|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the food truck resurgence was fueled by a combination of post-recessionary factors. Due to an apparent combination of economic and technological factors combined with street food being "hip" or "chic", there has been an increase in the number of food trucks in the United States.&lt;ref name="mashable.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryssdal, Kai,  [http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/07/30/food-truck-nation/ Food Truck Nation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711074028/http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/07/30/food-truck-nation/ |date=2012-07-11 }}, American Public Media, Friday, July 30, 2010. Retrieved: September 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction business was drying up, leading to a surplus of food trucks, and chefs from high-end restaurants were being laid off.

Once more commonplace in American coastal big cities like New York and LA, gourmet food trucks are now to be found as well in the suburbs, and in small towns across the country.&lt;ref name="dallasmorningnews-parks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wboxfox21-smalltown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.wboc.com/food-on-the-go/ |title=Food on the go |publisher=WBOC/Fox21 |accessdate=1 July 2015 |author=Greene, Cleo |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Zi3Se7Mf?url=http://content.wboc.com/food-on-the-go/ |archivedate=2 July 2015 |df= }} Published Dec. 2014 ()&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-safety"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/08/health/food-trucks-safety/ | title=Are food trucks safe? | publisher=CNN | date=8  April 2013 | accessdate=1 July 2015 | author=Cicero, Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food trucks are also being hired for special events, like weddings, movie shoots, and corporate gatherings, and also to carry advertising promoting companies and brands.&lt;ref name="wsj-weddings"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303714704576383682135167132 | title=Every Bride Expects a Lovely Food Truck | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=14 Jun 2011 | accessdate=20 January 2016 | author=Reddy, Sumathi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The gourmet food truck==
A modern-day food truck is not simply an ordinary taco truck one might find at a construction site.&lt;ref&gt;Olivia BarkerUSA, T. (n.d). [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/LIFE/usaedition/2011-08-11-food-trucks_CV_U.htm A foodie-fueled trend takes its act on the road]. USA Today.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine noted that the food truck had "largely transcended its roach-coach classification and is now a respectable venue for aspiring chefs to launch careers."&lt;ref name=nymag /&gt; These gourmet trucks' menus run the gamut of ethnic and fusion cuisine. Often focusing on limited but creative dishes at reasonable prices, they offer customers a chance to experience food they otherwise may not. Finding a niche seems to be a path to success for most trucks. While one truck may specialize in outlandish burgers, another may serve only lobster rolls.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Food trucks are now even [[Zagat]] rated.

Tracking food trucks has been made easy with social media like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], where a favorite gourmet truck can be located at any moment, with updates on specials, new menu items and location changes.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, A. (2011). Will tweet for food. The impact of twitter and New York City food trucks, online, offline, and inline.

The popularity of food trucks lead to the creation of associations that protect and support their business rights, such as the [[Philadelphia Mobile Food Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.us/philadelphia/news/local/2012/03/18/street-food-carts-and-trucks-have-grown-in-stature/ |title=Street food cards and trucks have grown in stature |publisher=Metro |date=2012-03-18 |accessdate=2013-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191721/http://www.metro.us/philadelphia/news/local/2012/03/18/street-food-carts-and-trucks-have-grown-in-stature/ |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and economics==
Food trucks are subject to the same range of concerns as other [[foodservice]] businesses. They generally require a fixed address to accept delivery of supplies. A commercial kitchen may be needed for food prep. There are a variety of permits to obtain, and a health code to observe. Labor and fuel costs are a significant part of the overhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hospitalitymagazine.com.au/food/profiles/the-business-of-street-food | title=The business of street food | publisher=Hospitality Magazine | date=23 August 2012 | accessdate=13 December 2014 | author=Bowling, Danielle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/five-things/starting-your-own-food-truck/4268/ | title=Starting your own food truck | publisher=PBS | date=October 15, 2010 | accessdate=21 February 2015 |author1=Bellow, Lily |author2=Jackeline Pou }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal definitions and requirements for food trucks vary widely by country and locality. For example, in Toronto, Canada, some of the requirements include business and liability insurance, a Commercial Vehicle Operator’s Registration for the truck, permits for each municipality being operated in (downtown, various suburbs), a food handler certificate, appropriate driver's licenses for drivers, assistant's licenses for assistants, and a health inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://torontofoodtrucks.ca/food-truck-faqs | title=Food Truck FAQs | publisher=Toronto Food Trucks (Freshdaily Inc.) | accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the rising number and popularity of food trucks push them into the food mainstream, region by region, problems with local legislators and police reacting to new situations, and brick-and-mortar restaurants fearing competition, have to be worked through, in some cases creating significant business uncertainty.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443404004577576992254177540 | title=Street Fight: Food Trucks vs. Restaurants | publisher=''Wall Street Journal'' | date=9 Aug 2012 | accessdate=21 February 2015 | author=Needleman, Sarah E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="japantoday"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/food/view/great-eats-on-the-go | title=Great eats on the go | publisher=JapanToday | date=3 Jun 2013 | accessdate=13 December 2014 | author=Shannon, Lauren}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hilary-gowins/three-cities-show-how-food-trucks_b_5621679.html | title=Three Cities Show How Food Trucks Live and Die on Political Whim | publisher=Huffington Post | date=26 July 2014 | accessdate=14 December 2014 | author=Gowins, Hilary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago long held the distinction of being the only city in the United States that did not allow food trucks to cook on board, which required trucks to prepare food in a commercial kitchen, then wrap and label the food and load it into a food warmer.

===Health concerns===
Food trucks have unique health risks compared to regular land-based restaurants when it comes to [[food safety]] and the prevention of [[foodborne illness]]. Most food trucks do not have access to adequate clean and hot water necessary to [[Hand washing|wash hands]] or to rinse off vegetables, as required by most health codes or regulations.&lt;ref name="Woolhouse"&gt;{{cite news |last=Woolhouse |first=Megan |last2=Rocheleau |first2=Matt |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/06/04/food-trucks-more-likely-shut-down-for-health-risk-than-restaurants-city-records-show/OL7A7oukeGSB98PkKQiujN/story.html |title=A major issue for some Boston food trucks?

In June 2017, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reviewed the 2016 city health records and found food truck had been cited for violations 200 times, with half of the violations being minor in nature and the other half being serious violations. When compared to fixed location restaurants, the city closed nine of the 96 licensed food trucks in 2016 and closed only two out of 100 restaurants. A majority of the serious violations were related to the lack of water and hand washing.&lt;ref name="Woolhouse" /&gt; An earlier study showed that Boston food trucks, on average, received 2.68 violations per inspection between 2011 and July 2013, while restaurants received 4.56 citations for violations per inspection. For "critical foodborne violations"—defined by the city as activities that contribute to foodborne illness, such as improper labeling of ingredients—food trucks and restaurants were roughly equivalent, with 0.87 violations per inspection for food trucks, and 0.84 for restaurants.&lt;!-- That's not a reference: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bennie|title=Food trucks as safe as restaurants, study says|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Around the world ==

===Asia===
[[File:Roasted Chicken Leg Steaks Truck at CWT42 20160213.jpg|thumb|A food truck in Taiwan]]
In Asia, the cuisine offered by food trucks requires simple skills, basic facilities and a relatively small amount of capital. They are plentiful, with large potential for income and often a very large sector for employment. Individuals facing difficulty finding work in formal sectors, will often venture into this industry, as it allows entire families to involve themselves in the preparing and cooking of foods sold to the public. The appeal involved in sustaining a food truck lie not only in the low capital requirement, but also in the flexibility of hours, with minimal constraints to locale. Street foods predominantly reflect local culture and flavor. Food trucks appeal to consumers in that they are often an inexpensive means of attaining quick meals. Location and word of mouth promotion has been credited for their widening success.&lt;ref&gt;Winarno, F.G. &amp; Allain, A.

The Belgian Food Truck Association is lobbying to legalize food trucks on the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Les Food Trucks ont désormais leurs emplacements officiels, à Bruxelles|url=https://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/bruxelles/detail_les-food-truck-ont-desormais-leurs-emplacements-officiels-a-bruxelles?id=8350737|accessdate=4 November 2016|work=RTBF Info|date=8 September 2014|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brussels municipality|Brussels]] was the first European city to propose locations for food trucks at football matches.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Belgium also holds the Brussels Food Truck Festival, the largest of its kind in Europe, every year in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rtbf.be/info/societe/detail_le-brussels-food-truck-festival-attend-70-000-gourmands?id=8966773 | title=Le Brussels Food Truck festival attend 70 000 gourmands | publisher=RTBF | date=27 Apr 2015 | accessdate=20 January 2016 | language=fr}} Original French: "le plus grand festival du genre en Europe"; Google translation: "the largest festival of its kind in Europe"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

In Canada, food trucks, also commonly known as ''cantines'' (French for cafeteria) in Quebec, are present across the country, serving a wide variety of cuisines, including anything from [[grilled cheese sandwiches]] to [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]].

===France===
Although food trucks are common at outdoor markets (For example, pizza trucks are common in [[Marseille]] and [[southern France]] since the 1960s), American-style trucks selling restaurant-quality food first appeared in Paris in 2012. Their owners needed to obtain permission from four separate government agencies, including the [[Prefecture of Police]], but the trucks' offerings—including tacos and hamburgers—have reportedly been very popular.&lt;ref name="moskin20120604"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/04/world/europe/food-trucks-add-american-flavor-to-paris.html?src=me&amp;ref=general&amp;pagewanted=all | title=Food Trucks in Paris?

===Mexico===

Although street food in Mexico is unregulated, food trucks are becoming increasingly popular as of 2013 and owners have created an association to pursue the professionalization and expansion of this commercial sector. In addition to the food trucks catering on the streets, there are regular bazaars organized to introduce their products to the consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeoutmexico.mx/df/compras-estilo/asociacion-mexicana-de-food-trucks|title=Asociación Mexicana de Food Trucks|publisher=Time Out México|date=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this popularity the Local Authorities have issued a series of special regulations to incorporate them to legal schemes that would help to order this commerce form. as new food truck business model emerged, some local bodybuilders begin to make food trucks from new vehicles from major car-makers.

===United Kingdom===
With the advent of motorised transport during [[World War II]], food trucks came into common use. [[Field kitchen|Mobile canteens]] were used in almost all theatres of war to boost morale and provide food as a result of the successful [[tea lady]] experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=51297&amp;sos=0 |title=Your Mobile Canteen in Action |publisher=Imperial War Museum |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food trucks today are known as snack vans and can be found on nearly all major trunk roads at the side of the road or in areas that have a large pedestrian population, such as at village fetes or town centers. These vans can specialise in myriad different food types, such as donuts, hamburgers, chili and chips, as well as ethnic food. Some people prefer to stop at snack vans when travelling, due to the low price, rather than stop at a motorway [[motorway service area|service station]] where prices can be extremely high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2013/sep/26/food-snack-vans-britain-gallery | title=Snack vans: food on the go – in pictures | publisher=The Guardian | date=26 September 2013 | accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Future of Life Institute''' ('''FLI''') is a volunteer-run research and outreach organization in the [[Boston]] area that works to mitigate [[existential risks]] facing humanity, particularly [[existential risk from artificial general intelligence|existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence]] (AI). Its founders include MIT cosmologist [[Max Tegmark]], Skype co-founder [[Jaan Tallinn]], and its board of advisors includes entrepreneur [[Elon Musk]] and cosmologist [[Stephen Hawking]] (prior to his death in 2018).

==Background==
The FLI mission is to catalyze and support research and initiatives for safeguarding life and developing optimistic visions of the future, including positive ways for humanity to steer its own course considering new technologies and challenges.&lt;ref name=huffpo_article&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-hawking/artificial-intelligence_b_5174265.html | title=Transcending Complacency on Superintelligent Machines | publisher=Huffington Post | date= 19 April 2014 | accessdate = 26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cser_news&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cser.org/fli/ | title=CSER News: 'A new existential risk reduction organisation has launched in Cambridge, Massachusetts' | publisher=Centre for the Study of Existential Risk | date = 31 May 2014 | accessdate = 19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; FLI is particularly focused on the potential risks to humanity from the development of human-level artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name=chronicle&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chronicle.com/article/Is-Artificial-Intelligence-a/148763/ | title = Is Artificial Intelligence a Threat? | publisher = Chronicle of Higher Education | accessdate = 18 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute was founded in March 2014 by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] cosmologist [[Max Tegmark]], [[Skype]] co-founder [[Jaan Tallinn]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]] graduate student and [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]] medalist Viktoriya Krakovna, [[Boston University|BU]] graduate student Meia Chita-Tegmark (Tegmark's wife), and [[University of California, Santa Cruz|UCSC]] physicist [[Anthony Aguirre]]. As of 2017, the Institute's 14-person Scientific Advisory Board comprises 13 men and one woman, and includes a computer scientist [[Stuart J. Russell]], biologist [[George M. Church|George Church]], cosmologists [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Saul Perlmutter]], theoretical physicist [[Frank Wilczek]], entrepreneur [[Elon Musk]], and actors and science communicators [[Alan Alda]] and [[Morgan Freeman]].&lt;ref name=atlantic_article&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/but-what-does-the-end-of-humanity-mean-for-me/361931/ |title=But What Would the End of Humanity Mean for Me? |publisher=The Atlantic | date = 9 May 2014 | accessdate = 11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fli_who_page&gt;{{cite web | url=http://futureoflife.org/who | title = Who we are | publisher= Future of Life Institute | accessdate = 11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=salon_article&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2014/10/05/our_science_fiction_apocalypse_meet_the_scientists_trying_to_predict_the_end_of_the_world/ |title = Our science-fiction apocalypse: Meet the scientists trying to predict the end of the world | publisher = Salon | accessdate = 8 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
FLI operates grassroots-style to recruit volunteers and younger scholars from the local community in the Boston area.&lt;ref name=chronicle /&gt;

== Events ==
On May 24, 2014, FLI held a panel discussion on "The Future of Technology: Benefits and Risks" at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], moderated by [[Alan Alda]].&lt;ref name=chronicle /&gt;&lt;ref name=fli_events_page&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.futureoflife.org/events | title = Events | publisher= Future of Life Institute | accessdate = 11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "miri june newsletter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://intelligence.org/2014/06/01/miris-june-2014-newsletter/ | title= Machine Intelligence Research Institute - June 2014 Newsletter | accessdate = 19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panelists were synthetic biologist [[George M.

On January 2, 2015 through January 5, 2015, the Future of Life Institute organized and hosted "The Future of AI: Opportunities and Challenges" conference, which brought together the world's leading AI builders from academia and industry to engage with each other and experts in economics, law, and ethics. The goal was to identify promising research directions that can help maximize the future benefits of AI.&lt;ref name=ai_conference&gt;{{cite web | url=http://futureoflife.org/misc/ai_conference |title=The Future of AI: Opportunities and Challenges  |publisher=Future of Life Institute| accessdate = 19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute circulated an [[Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence|open letter on AI safety]] at the conference which was subsequently signed by [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Elon Musk]], and many artificial intelligence experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence: an Open Letter|url=http://futureoflife.org/misc/open_letter|publisher=Future of Life Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, FLI organized a private gathering of what ''The New York Times'' called "heavy hitters of A.I." (including [[Yann LeCun]], Elon Musk, and [[Nick Bostrom]]) to discuss concerns that A.I. research could lead to dangerous results.&lt;ref name="nyt0617"&gt; {{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/09/technology/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-artificial-intelligence.html |title=Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and the Feud Over Killer Robots |last=Metz |first=Cade |work=NYT |quote=The private gathering at the Asilomar Hotel was organized by the Future of Life Institute, a think tank built to discuss the existential risks of A.I. and other technologies. |date=June 9, 2018 |accessdate=June 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:European Output of Printed Books ca. 1450–1800.png|thumb|300px|European output of printed books from the 15th through the 18th century]]

The '''global spread of the printing press''' began with the invention of the [[printing press]] with [[movable type]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in [[Mainz]], [[Germany]] {{Circa|1439}}. [[Western world|Western]] [[History of printing|printing technology]] was adopted in all world regions by the end of the 19th century, displacing the [[manuscript]] and [[block printing]].

In the [[Western world]], the operation of a press became synonymous with the enterprise of publishing and lent its name to a new branch of media, the "[[Newspaper|press]]" (see [[List of the oldest newspapers]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=387}}: {{quote|At the same time, then, as the printing press in the physical, technological sense was invented, 'the press' in the extended sense of the word also entered the historical stage. The phenomenon of publishing was born.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spread of the Gutenberg press ==

=== Germany ===
[[File:DBP 1954 198 Gutenberg.jpg|thumb|Modern stamp commemorating the [[Gutenberg Bible]], the first major European work printed by mechanical movable type]]

Gutenberg's first major print work was the [[42-line Bible]] in [[Latin]], printed probably between 1452 and 1454 in the German city of [[Mainz]]. After Gutenberg lost a lawsuit against his investor [[Johann Fust]], Fust put Gutenberg's employee [[Peter Schöffer]] in charge of the print shop. Thereupon Gutenberg established a new one with the financial backing of another money lender. With Gutenberg's monopoly revoked, and the technology no longer secret, printing spread throughout Germany and beyond, diffused first by emigrating German printers, but soon also by foreign apprentices.

=== Europe ===
In rapid succession, printing presses were set up in Central and Western Europe. Major towns, in particular, functioned as centers of diffusion ([[Cologne]] 1466, [[Rome]] 1467, [[Venice]] 1469, [[Paris]] 1470, [[Kraków]] 1473, [[London]] 1477). In 1481, barely 30 years after the publication of the 42-line Bible, the small Netherlands already featured printing shops in 21 cities and towns, while Italy and Germany each had shops in about 40 towns at that time. According to one estimate, "by 1500, 1000 printing presses were in operation throughout Western Europe and had produced 8 million books"&lt;ref&gt;E. L. Eisenstein: "The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe", Cambridge, 1993, pp. 13–17, quoted in: [[Angus Maddison]]: "Growth and Interaction in the World Economy: The Roots of Modernity", Washington 2005, p.17f.&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 1550s there were "three hundred or more" printers and booksellers in Geneva alone.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein Elizabeth L. (1979) — The Printing Press as an Agent of Change, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; The output was in the order of twenty million volumes and rose in the sixteenth century tenfold to between 150 and 200 million copies.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."&gt;Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean (1976): "The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing 1450–1800", London: New Left Books, quoted in: Anderson, Benedict: "[http://www.perio.unlp.edu.ar/catedras/system/files/anderson_benedict-_comunidades_imaginadas.pdf Comunidades Imaginadas. Reflexiones sobre el origen y la difusión del nacionalismo]", Fondo de cultura económica, Mexico 1993, {{ISBN|978-968-16-3867-2}}, pp. 58f.&lt;/ref&gt;  Germany and Italy were considered the two main centres of printing in terms of quantity and quality.

=== Rest of the world ===
The near-simultaneous discovery of sea routes to the West ([[Christopher Columbus]], 1492) and East ([[Vasco da Gama]], 1498) and [[Age of Discovery|the subsequent establishment of trade links]] greatly facilitated the global spread of Gutenberg-style printing.  Traders, colonists, but perhaps most importantly, missionaries exported printing presses to the new European oversea domains, setting up new print shops and distributing printing material.  In the Americas, the first extra-European print shop was founded in [[Mexico City]] in 1544 (1539?), and soon after [[Jesuits]] started operating the first printing press in Asia ([[Goa]], 1556).

For a long time however, movable type printing remained mainly the business of Europeans working from within the confines of their colonies. According to Suraiya Faroqhi, lack of interest and religious reasons were among the reasons for the slow adoption of the printing press outside Europe: Thus, the printing of Arabic, after encountering strong opposition by [[Ulama|Muslim legal scholars]] and the [[manuscript]] scribes, remained prohibited in the [[Ottoman empire]] between 1483 and 1729, initially even on penalty of death,&lt;ref&gt;Suraiya Faroqhi, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cQ8ZLZh9WjwC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=printing+Qu%27ran&amp;ei=v5jbS8qMBo-GzgSw8eGcCQ&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=printing%20Qu%27ran&amp;f=false ''Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire''], pp, 134-136, I.B.Tauris, 2005, {{ISBN|1-85043-760-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85043-760-4}};[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PvwUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA803&amp;dq=Islam+block+printing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=QTncS9WLKp2WyAS2yPnGCQ&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Encyclopaedia of Islam: Fascicules 111-112 : Masrah Mawlid], Clifford Edmund Bosworth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watson| 1968|p=435}}; {{harvnb|Clogg| 1979|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some movable Arabic type printing was done by [[Pope Julius II]] (1503−1512) for distribution among Middle Eastern Christians,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krek| 1979|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the oldest [[Qur’an]] printed with movable type was produced in Venice in 1537/1538 for the Ottoman market.

In India, reports are that Jesuits "presented a polyglot Bible to the Emperor [[Akbar]] in 1580 but did not succeed in arousing much curiosity."&lt;ref name="Angus Maddison 65"&gt;Angus Maddison: Growth and Interaction in the World Economy: The Roots of Modernity, Washington 2005, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; But also practical reasons seem to have played a role. The [[English East India Company]], for example, brought a printer to [[Surat]] in 1675, but was not able to cast type in Indian scripts, so the venture failed.&lt;ref name="Angus Maddison 65"/&gt;

North America saw the adoption by the Cherokee Indian [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]] who published the tribe's first newspaper ''[[Cherokee Phoenix]]'' from 1828, partly in his native language, using the Cherokee alphabet recently invented by his compatriot [[Sequoyah]].

In the 19th century, the arrival of the Gutenberg-style press to the shores of [[Tahiti]] (1818), [[Hawaii]] (1821) and other Pacific islands, marked the end of a global diffusion process which had begun almost 400 years earlier. At the same time, the "old style" press (as the Gutenberg model came to be termed in the 19th century), was already in the process of being displaced by industrial machines like the [[Friedrich Koenig|steam powered press]] (1812) and the [[rotary press]] (1833), which radically departed from Gutenberg's design, but were still of the same development line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolza| 1967}}; {{harvnb|Gerhardt| 1971}}; {{harvnb|Gerhardt| 1978|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, printing presses were established in 77 Italian cities and towns. At the end of the following century, 151 locations in Italy had seen at one time printing activities, of which 130 (86%) were north of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borsa| 1976|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these two centuries a total of 2894 printers were active in Italy, with only 216 of them located in southern Italy. Ca. 60% of the Italian printing shops were situated in six cities (Venice, Rome, Milan, Naples, Bologna and Florence), with the concentration of printers in Venice being particularly high (ca. 30%).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borsa| 1977|pp=166–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Đurađ IV Crnojević used the printing press brought to Cetinje by his father [[Ivan I Crnojević]] to print the first books in southeastern Europe, in 1493. The [[Crnojević]] printing press operated from 1493 through 1496, turning out religious books of which five have been preserved: ''Oktoih prvoglasnik'', ''Oktoih petoglasnik'', ''Psaltir'', ''Molitvenik'' and ''Četvorojevanđelje'' (the first Bible in Serbian language). Đurađ managed the printing of the books, wrote prefaces and afterwords, and developed sophisticated tables of Psalms with the lunar calendar. The books from the Crnojević press were printed in two colors, red and black, and were richly ornamented. They served as models for many of the subsequent books printed in Cyrillic.

Until the reign of [[Peter the Great]] printing in Russia remained confined to the print office established by Fedorov in Moscow. In the 18th century, annual printing output gradually rose from 147 titles in 1724 to 435 (1787), but remained constrained by state censorship and widespread illiteracy.&lt;ref name="Klaus Appel 96ff."&gt;{{harvnb|Appel| 1987|pp=96ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to religious qualms, [[Sultan Bayezid II]] and successors prohibited printing in [[Arabic script]] in the [[Ottoman empire]] from 1483 on penalty of death, but printing in other scripts was done by Jews as well as the Greek and Armenian communities (1515 Saloniki, 1554 [[Bursa]] (Adrianople), 1552 Belgrade, 1658 Smyrna). In 1727, Sultan Achmed III gave his permission for the establishment of the first legal print house for printing secular works in Arabic script (religious publications still remained forbidden),&lt;ref name="Watson 1968, 436"/&gt; but printing activities did not really take off until the 19th century.

'''The Hilton Cleveland Downtown Hotel''' '''''(HCDH)''''' is a [[skyscraper]] on the corner of [[Ontario Street]] and Lakeside Avenue along [[The Mall (Cleveland)|The Mall]] in [[downtown Cleveland]], Ohio, United States. It opened in 2016, has 600 rooms and stands 32 stories in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/architecture/index.ssf/2015/06/first_look_new_downtown_hilton.html|title=First look: new downtown Hilton offers stunning views of downtown, Lake Erie (photos)|work=Cleveland.com|accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of four Hilton properties in downtown Cleveland, the other three being [[Hilton Garden Inn (Cleveland)|Hilton Garden Inn]], the [[DoubleTree Hotel Cleveland]], and Hampton Inn.

The building was constructed under a partnership between the city of [[Cleveland]] and [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] for the purposes of attracting larger conventions to the city of Cleveland. The agreement was entered into under the first chief executive of Cuyahoga County, [[Ed FitzGerald]]'s administration and the three-term Cleveland mayor [[Frank G. Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/architecture/index.ssf/2015/04/hilton_downtown_cleveland_conv.html|title=Hilton Downtown Cleveland convention hotel is on track for completion in time for Republican National Convention|work=Cleveland.com|accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotel is the tallest and largest in the city. Previously, the largest hotel in the city was the [[Renaissance Cleveland Hotel]] which has 500 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Peter S. (29 April 1990). "Hotel Disasters Have Put Key Issue Under Fire". Los Angeles Times (latimes.com). Retrieved 2014-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first major hotel constructed in the city since the building of the [[Marriott at Key Center]] in 1991 at a height of 320 feet with 385 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;"Cleveland Marriott Downtown at Key Center". Emporis.com. Retrieved 2015-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The new Hilton is managed by Teri Agosta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20150120/FREE/150129975/teri-agosta-named-general-manager-of-the-600-room-hilton-cleveland|title=CrainsCleveland.com : Subscription Center|work=Crainscleveland.com|accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Impetus for hotel==
Following the completion of the new [[Global Center for Health Innovation]] and spurred by a tax over run that was raised by the county to construct that facility, the first chief executive of Cuyahoga County, [[Ed FitzGerald]] spearheaded the notion that the county needed to mount a hotel project to meet demand for bigger conventions that would overlook Cleveland simply because it no longer had a large enough hotel to accommodate over 500 guests at a time in one location.

This was due to the fact that back in the 1990s, the [[Stouffer's]] company (who owned the hotel at the time) renovated the 1000 room [[Hotel Cleveland]] at [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] (connected to the iconic [[Terminal Tower]]) down to just 500 rooms. Not many Clevelanders knew this, but tourist groups and convention planners certainly did. This had become something of a liability to the tourism of Cuyahoga County and Cleveland was no longer be considered a convention town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/cuyahoga-county/index.ssf/2014/12/11_things_ed_fitzgerald_will_be_remembered_for_in_cuyahoga_county.html|title=11 actions Ed FitzGerald, Cuyahoga County's first executive, will be remembered for|work=Cleveland.com|accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acknowledged that the Hilton Hotel project was instrumental in landing the [[2016 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrea-poe/republican-national-conve_2_b_10357560.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financing==
The Hotel cost $272 million.
The city of Cleveland passed legislation that led to the financing structure for the hotel in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/cityhall/index.ssf/2013/12/cleveland_city_council_passes.html|title=Cleveland City Council passes Convention Center Hotel financing plan, after all|work=Cleveland.com|accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cuyahoga County followed suit by passing approval for the project in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideastream.org/news/cuyahoga-county-oks-272-million-downtown-cleveland-hotel-projectr ]{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lead architect on the project was the Atlanta firm of [[Cooper Carry]]. The project is [[LEED certified]] and has an extensive use of glass to create three slender modern towers jutting up from a four-story concrete pedestal base. It contains a main and junior ballroom. The hotel is an homage to the visionary civic minded [[Daniel Burnham]] Cleveland [[Group Plan]] that was instituted in 1903, as per this fact the hotel's new bar is called the Burnham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coopercarry.com/project/hilton-cleveland-downtown/ |title=Hilton Cleveland Downtown |publisher=Cooper Carry |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The skyscraper was erected by the [[New York City]] firm [[Turner Construction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turnerconstruction.com/experience/project/656E/hilton-cleveland-downtown |title=Hilton Cleveland Downtown &amp;#124; Turner Construction Company |publisher=Turnerconstruction.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyderabad''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|ər|ə|b|a:|d|audio=Hyderabad.ogg}} {{respell|HY|dər|ə|baad}}) is the capital of the [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Telangana]] and ''[[de jure]]'' capital of [[Andhra Pradesh]].{{refn|According to the [[Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014]] part 2 Section 5:(1) On and from the appointed day, Hyderabad in the existing State of [[Andhra Pradesh]], shall be the common capital of the State of [[Telangana]] and the State of Andhra Pradesh for such period not exceeding ten years.&lt;br /&gt;(2) After expiry of the period referred to in sub-section (1), Hyderabad shall be the capital of the State of Telangana and there shall be a new capital for the State of Andhra Pradesh.&lt;br /&gt;The common capital is defined as the existing area notified as the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation under the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act, 1955. Though Andhra Pradesh uses facilities in Hyderabad during the transition period, Telangana state is responsible for day-to-day administration of the city. City MLAs are members of the [[Legislature of Telangana]] (§&amp;nbsp;3 and 18(1) of the Act).|group=upper-alpha}} Occupying {{convert|650|km2|sqmi}} along the banks of the [[Musi River (India)|Musi River]], it has a population of about {{nowrap|6.9 million}} and a [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] population of about {{nowrap|7.75 million}}, making it the [[List of most populous cities in India|fourth most populous city]] and [[List of million-plus urban agglomerations in India|sixth most populous urban agglomeration]] in India. At an average altitude of {{convert|542|m|ft}}, much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes, including [[Hussain Sagar]]—predating the city's founding—north of the city centre.

Established in 1591 by [[Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah]], Hyderabad remained under the rule of the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] for nearly a century before the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] captured the region. In 1724, Mughal viceroy [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asif Jah I|Asif Jah I]] declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty, known as the [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizams of Hyderabad]]. The [[Hyderabad State|Nizam's dominions]] became a [[princely state]] during the [[British Raj]], and remained so for {{nowrap|150 years}}, with the city serving as its capital. The city continued as the capital of [[Hyderabad State (1948–56)|Hyderabad State]] after it was brought into the [[Indian Union]] in 1948, and became the capital of Andhra Pradesh after the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]]. Since 1956, [[Rashtrapati Nilayam]] in the city has been the winter office of the [[President of India]]. In 2014, the newly formed state of Telangana [[Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014|split from Andhra Pradesh]] and the city became the joint capital of the two states, a transitional arrangement scheduled to end by 2025.

Relics of Qutb Shahi and Nizam rule remain visible today; the [[Charminar]]—commissioned by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah—has come to symbolise Hyderabad. [[Golconda]] fort is another major landmark. The influence of [[Indo-Persian culture|Mughlai culture]] is also evident in the region's [[Hyderabadi cuisine|distinctive cuisine]], which includes [[Hyderabadi biryani]] and [[Hyderabadi haleem]]. The Qutb Shahis and Nizams established Hyderabad as a cultural hub, attracting men of letters from different parts of the world. Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire in the mid-19th century, with artists migrating to the city from the rest of the Indian subcontinent. The [[Telugu film industry]] based in the city is the country's second-largest producer of motion pictures. 

Hyderabad was historically known as a pearl and diamond trading centre, and it continues to be known as the "City of Pearls". Many of the city's traditional [[bazaar]]s remain open, including [[Laad Bazaar]], [[Begum Bazaar]] and [[Sultan Bazaar]]. Industrialisation throughout the {{nowrap|20th century}} attracted major Indian research, manufacturing and financial institutions, including [[Defence Research and Development Organization]], [[Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited]], Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, the [[National Geophysical Research Institute]] and the [[Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology]]. [[Special economic zone]]s dedicated to [[information technology]] have encouraged companies from India and around the world to set up operations in Hyderabad. The emergence of [[pharmaceutical]] and [[biotechnology]] industries in the 1990s led to the area's naming as India's "[[Genome Valley]]". With an output of {{US$}}74&amp;nbsp;billion, Hyderabad is the fifth-largest contributor to India's overall [[gross domestic product]].

According to [[John Everett-Heath]], the author of ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of World Place Names'', ''Hyderabad'' means "Haydar's city" or "lion city", from ''[[haydar]]'' (lion) and ''[[-abad|ābād]]'' (city), and was named to honour the [[Caliph]] [[Ali Ibn Abi Talib]], who was also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battles.&lt;ref name="Everett-Heath2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise dictionary of world place names|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=223|isbn=978-0-19-860537-9|last=Everett-Heath|first=John|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Petersen, a scholar of Islamic architecture, says the city was originally called ''Baghnagar'' (city of gardens).&lt;ref name="AnPet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Islamic architecture|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=112|isbn=978-0-415-06084-4|last=Petersen|first=Andrew|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; One popular theory suggests that the founder of the city, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of the [[Golconda Sultanate]], named it after [[Bhagmati]], a local ''[[nautch]]'' (dancing) girl with whom he had fallen in love.

According to German traveller [[Heinrich von Poser]], whose travelogue of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] was translated by Gita Dharampal-Frick of [[Heidelberg University]], there were two names for the city: "On 3 December 1622, we reached the city of Bagneger or Hederabat, the seat of the king Sultan Mehemet Culi Cuttub Shah and the capital of the kingdom".&lt;ref name="TH-Hyd name"&gt;{{cite news|title=The city of love: Hyderabad|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/the-city-of-love-hyderabad/article9198014.ece|last=Nanisetti|first=Serish|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=7 October 2016|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; French traveller [[Jean de Thévenot]] visited the Deccan region in 1666–1667 refers to the city in his book ''Travels in India'' as "Bagnagar and Aiderabad".&lt;ref name="TH-Hyd name" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asia in the Making of Europe|volume=3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YPPiumz4vx0C|publisher=[[University Of Chicago Press]]|page=?|isbn=978-0-226-46768-9|last1=Lach|first1=Donald F|last2=Kley|first2=Edwin J.

The Kakatiya dynasty was reduced to a vassal of the [[Khalji dynasty]] in 1310 after its defeat by Sultan [[Alauddin Khalji]] of the [[Delhi Sultanate]].

The Hyderabad area was under the control of the [[Musunuri Nayaks]] at this time, who, however, were forced to cede it to the Bahmani Sultanate in 1364.

=== Music and films ===
[[South Indian music]] and dances such as the [[Kuchipudi]] and [[Bharatanatyam]] styles are popular in the Deccan region. As a result of their culture policies, [[North Indian music]] and dance gained popularity during the rule of the Mughals and Nizams,&lt;ref name="Nigam&amp;Bhatnagar"&gt;{{cite book|title=Romance of Hyderabad culture|page=44|last1=Nigam|first1=Mohan Lal|last2=Bhatnagar|first2=Anupama|publisher=Deva Publication|year=1997|oclc=644231278}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with [[tawaif]] (courtesans). These courtesans were revered as the epitome of etiquette and culture, and were appointed to teach singing, poetry and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy.&lt;ref name="rekha"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Women in the Hyderabad State in 19th and 20th centuries|url=http://jhss.org/articleview.php?artid=143|last=Rekha|first=Pande|editor=Tiwari, Pushpa|journal=Journal of History and Social Science|year=2012|issn=2229-5798|accessdate=6 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104122459/http://jhss.org/articleview.php?artid=143|archivedate=4 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise to certain styles of court music, dance and poetry.

'''Hyper-interactive teaching technology''' or '''H-ITT''' is a form of technology used primarily to interact between the [[student]]s and [[teacher]]s.  Students generally are given an H-ITT [[transmitter]], which is similar to a [[remote control]], which allows them to answer questions in [[Voting|poll]] or [[quiz]] form.

It also means that the interaction between the teacher, the students and among the students is very high. The term is frequently used to denote a constant conversation among the students themselves, and learning with each other, which is not usually the case in a conventional teaching medium.

'''Instrument flight rules''' ('''IFR''') is one of two sets of regulations governing all aspects of [[civil aviation]] aircraft operations; the other is [[visual flight rules]] (VFR).

The U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s (FAA) ''Instrument Flying Handbook'' defines IFR as: "Rules and regulations established by the FAA to govern flight under conditions in which flight by outside visual reference is not safe. IFR flight depends upon flying by reference to instruments in the [[cockpit|flight deck]], and navigation is accomplished by reference to electronic signals."&lt;ref name='FAA-H-8083-51A'&gt;{{citation

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a term used by pilots and controllers to indicate the type of flight plan an aircraft is flying, such as an IFR or VFR flight plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Basic information==

===Comparison to visual flight rules===
{{Main|Visual flight rules}}
To put instrument flight rules into context, a brief overview of visual flight rules (VFR) is necessary. It is possible and fairly straightforward, in relatively clear weather conditions, to fly a plane solely by reference to outside visual cues, such as the horizon to maintain orientation, nearby buildings and terrain features for navigation, and other aircraft to maintain separation. This is known as operating the aircraft under VFR, and is the most common mode of operation for small aircraft. However, it is safe to fly VFR only when these outside references can be clearly seen from a sufficient distance; when flying through or above clouds, or in fog, rain, dust or similar low-level weather conditions, these references can be obscured. Thus, cloud ceiling and flight visibility are the most important variables for safe operations during all phases of flight.&lt;ref name='NASA/CR-2000-210288'&gt; {{cite book

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The minimum weather conditions for ceiling and visibility for VFR flights are defined in FAR Part 91.155, and vary depending on the type of [[airspace]] in which the aircraft is operating, and on whether the flight is conducted during daytime or nighttime.  However, typical daytime VFR minimums for most airspace is 3 [[statute miles]] of flight visibility and a distance from clouds of 500' below, 1,000' above, and 2,000' feet horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | url = http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2010/janqtr/pdf/14cfr91.155.pdf
 | accessdate = 2010-11-27}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Flight conditions reported as equal to or greater than these VFR minimums are referred to as [[visual meteorological conditions]] (VMC).

Any aircraft operating under VFR must have the required equipment on board, as described in FAR Part 91.205&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgFAR.nsf/0/D97FA35A1232A3988625768F005C12DE?OpenDocument|title=FAR Part  91 Sec. 91.205 effective as of 10/20/2009|author=|date=|website=rgl.faa.gov|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which includes some instruments necessary for IFR flight). VFR pilots ''may'' use cockpit instruments as secondary aids to navigation and orientation, but are not required to; the view outside of the aircraft is the primary source for keeping the aircraft straight and level (orientation), flying to the intended destination [[pilotage|(navigation)]], and not hitting anything (separation).&lt;ref name='flying_rc'&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual flight rules are generally simpler than instrument flight rules, and require significantly less training and practice. VFR provides a great degree of freedom, allowing pilots to go where they want, when they want, and allows them a much wider latitude in determining how they get there.&lt;ref name='flying_lw'&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instrument Flight Rules===
When operation of an aircraft under VFR is not safe, because the visual cues outside the aircraft are obscured by weather, instrument flight rules must be used instead. IFR permits an aircraft to operate in [[instrument meteorological conditions]] (IMC), which is essentially any weather condition less than VMC but in which aircraft can still operate safely. Use of instrument flight rules is also required when flying in "Class A" airspace regardless of weather conditions. Class A airspace extends from 18,000 feet above mean sea level to flight level 600 (60,000 feet [[pressure altitude]]) above the contiguous 48 United States and overlying the waters within 12 miles thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/D32C5D905064AF1286257BE80061CDC5?OpenDocument |title=FAR Part 71 Sec. 71.33 |access-date=24 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flight in Class A airspace requires pilots and aircraft to be instrument equipped and rated and to be operating under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). In many countries commercial airliners and their pilots must operate under IFR as the majority of flights enter Class A airspace; however, aircraft operating as commercial airliners must operate under IFR even if the flight plan does not take the craft into Class A airspace, such as with smaller regional flights.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Regulations Title 14, Chapter I, Subchapter E, [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=bbf147e9365fd8eeb50e73177f8c1bd8&amp;node=sp14.2.71.a&amp;rgn=div6 §71.31], [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=bbf147e9365fd8eeb50e73177f8c1bd8&amp;node=sp14.2.71.a&amp;rgn=div6 §71.33]&lt;/ref&gt; Procedures and training are significantly more complex compared to VFR instruction, as a pilot must demonstrate competency in conducting an entire [[Cross-country flying|cross-country flight]] solely by reference to instruments.

Instrument pilots must meticulously evaluate weather, create a very detailed flight plan based around specific instrument departure, en route, and arrival procedures, and dispatch the flight.&lt;ref name='flying_rc'/&gt;&lt;ref name='flying_rg'&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Separation and clearance==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}

The distance by which an aircraft avoids obstacles or other aircraft is termed ''separation''. The most important concept of IFR flying is that separation is maintained regardless of weather conditions. In [[controlled airspace]], [[air traffic control]] (ATC) separates IFR aircraft from obstacles and other aircraft using a flight ''clearance'' based on route, time, distance, speed, and altitude. ATC monitors IFR flights on [[radar]], or through aircraft position reports in areas where radar coverage is not available. Aircraft position reports are sent as voice radio transmissions. In the United States, a flight operating under IFR is required to provide position reports unless ATC advises a pilot that the plane is in radar contact.  The pilot must resume position reports after ATC advises that radar contact has been lost, or that radar services are terminated.

IFR flights in controlled airspace require an ATC ''clearance'' for each part of the flight. A clearance always specifies a ''clearance limit'', which is the farthest the aircraft can fly without a new clearance. In addition, a clearance typically provides a heading or route to follow, altitude, and communication parameters, such as frequencies and [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]] codes.

In uncontrolled airspace, ATC clearances are unavailable.  In some states a form of separation is provided to certain aircraft in uncontrolled airspace as far as is practical (often known under ICAO as an advisory service in class G airspace), but separation is not mandated nor widely provided.

Despite the protection offered by flight in controlled airspace under IFR, the ultimate responsibility for the safety of the aircraft rests with the pilot in command, who can refuse clearances.

==Weather==
[[File:IFR on top.jpg|thumb|IFR flying with clouds below]]
It is essential to differentiate between flight plan type (VFR or IFR) and weather conditions (VMC or IMC).  While current and forecast weather may be a factor in deciding which type of flight plan to file, weather conditions themselves do not affect one's filed flight plan. For example, an IFR flight that encounters [[visual meteorological conditions]] (VMC) en route does not automatically change to a VFR flight, and the flight must still follow all IFR procedures regardless of weather conditions. In the US, weather conditions are forecast broadly as VFR, MVFR (Marginal Visual Flight Rules), IFR, or LIFR (Low Instrument Flight Rules).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweather.gov/adds/metars/description/page_no/4 Aviation Weather Center - METARs Help Page (4 of 5)] National Weather Center. Retrieved 29 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The main purpose of IFR is the safe operation of aircraft in [[instrument meteorological conditions]] (IMC). The weather is considered to be MVFR or IMC when it does not meet the minimum requirements for [[visual meteorological conditions]] (VMC).  To operate safely in IMC ("actual instrument conditions"), a pilot controls the aircraft relying on [[flight instruments]] and ATC provides separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCloy |first=John |title=Safety Pilot in IMC |work=IFR magazine |url=http://www.ifr-magazine.com/safety_pilot.html |accessdate=2009-05-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905150824/http://www.ifr-magazine.com/safety_pilot.html |archivedate=5 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important not to confuse IFR with IMC. A significant amount of IFR flying is conducted in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). Anytime a flight is operating in VMC and in a volume of airspace in which VFR traffic can operate, the crew is responsible for seeing and avoiding VFR traffic; however, because the flight is conducted under Instrument Flight Rules, ATC still provides separation services from other IFR traffic, and can in many cases also advise the crew of the location of VFR traffic near the flight path.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Although dangerous and illegal, a certain amount of VFR flying is conducted in IMC.  A scenario is a VFR pilot taking off in VMC conditions, but encountering deteriorating visibility while en route. Continued VFR flight into IMC can lead to [[spatial disorientation]] of the pilot which is the cause of a significant number of general aviation crashes. VFR flight into IMC is distinct from "VFR-on-top", an IFR procedure in which the aircraft operates in VMC using a hybrid of VFR and IFR rules, and "VFR over the top", a VFR procedure in which the aircraft takes off and lands in VMC but flies above an intervening area of IMC. Also possible in many countries is "Special VFR" flight, where an aircraft is explicitly granted permission to operate VFR within the controlled airspace of an airport in conditions technically less than VMC; the pilot asserts they have the necessary visibility to fly despite the weather, must stay in contact with ATC, and cannot leave controlled airspace while still below VMC minimums.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

During flight under IFR, there are no visibility requirements, so flying through clouds (or other conditions where there is zero visibility outside the aircraft) is legal and safe. However, there are still minimum weather conditions that must be present in order for the aircraft to take off or to land; these vary according to the kind of operation, the type of navigation aids available, the location and height of terrain and obstructions in the vicinity of the airport, equipment on the aircraft, and the qualifications of the crew. For example, [[Reno-Tahoe International Airport]] (KRNO) in a mountainous region has significantly different [[instrument approach]]es for aircraft landing on the same runway surface, but from opposite directions.  Aircraft approaching from the north must make visual contact with the airport at a higher altitude than when approaching from the south because of rapidly rising terrain south of the airport.&lt;ref&gt;See KRNO [[approach plate]]s for "LOC RWY 16R", "ILS RWY 16R", and "ILS or LOC/DME RWY 34L".&lt;/ref&gt; This higher altitude allows a flight crew to clear the obstacle if a landing is aborted. In general, each specific instrument approach specifies the minimum weather conditions to permit landing.

Although large airliners, and increasingly, smaller aircraft, carry their own [[terrain awareness and warning system]] (TAWS),&lt;ref name="skybrary.aero"&gt;[http://www.skybrary.aero/bookshelf/books/2328.pdf "Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems—TAWS"]. Skybrary. Retrieved 11 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; these are primarily backup systems providing a last layer of defense if a sequence of errors or omissions causes a dangerous situation.&lt;ref name="skybrary.aero"/&gt;

==Navigation==
Because IFR flights often take place without visual reference to the ground, a means of navigation other than looking outside the window is required.  A number of [[navaids|navigational aids]] are available to pilots, including ground-based systems such as [[Distance Measuring Equipment|DME]]/[[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]]s and [[Non-directional beacon|NDB]]s as well as the satellite-based [[Global Positioning System|GPS/GNSS]] system.  Air traffic control may assist in navigation by assigning pilots specific headings ("radar vectors").  The majority of IFR navigation is given by ground- and satellite-based systems, while radar vectors are usually reserved by ATC for sequencing aircraft for a busy approach or transitioning aircraft from takeoff to cruise, among other things.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Autopilot===
[[Autopilot]] allows automatic piloting.

Modern [[flight management system]]s have evolved to allow a crew to plan a flight as to route and altitude and to specific time of arrival at specific locations.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} This capability is used in several trial projects experimenting with ''four-dimensional'' approach clearances for commercial aircraft, with time as the fourth dimension.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} These clearances allow ATC to optimize the arrival of aircraft at major airports, which increases airport capacity and uses less fuel providing monetary and environmental benefits to airlines and the public.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Procedures==
{{Main|Instrument approach|Flight procedure}}
Specific procedures allow IFR aircraft to transition safely through every stage of flight.  These procedures specify how an IFR pilot should respond, even in the event of a complete radio failure, and loss of communications with ATC, including the expected aircraft course and altitude.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Departures are described in an IFR clearance issued by ATC prior to takeoff. The departure clearance may contain an assigned heading, one or more waypoints, and an initial altitude to fly. The clearance can also specify a [[departure procedure]] (DP) or [[standard instrument departure]] (SID) that should be followed unless "NO DP" is specified in the notes section of the filed flight plan.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Here is an example of an IFR clearance for a Cessna aircraft traveling from Palo Alto airport (KPAO) to Stockton airport (KSCK).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| "Cessna 21756, cleared to Stockton Airport via turn right heading zero-six-zero within one mile of the airport. Radar vectors San Jose, then as filed. Maintain three thousand expect five thousand five minutes after departure. Departure frequency is one two one decimal three. Squawk four two six three."
|}

Detailed explanation:

;"Cessna 21756": Verifies that only this specific aircraft is cleared.

;"cleared to Stockton Airport": '''Clearance Limit''': the farthest destination the aircraft is allowed to go under IFR (in most cases it is the destination airport).

;"via turn right heading zero-six-zero within one mile of the airport.": The pilot is expected to execute the right turn to 060° magnetic heading without further ATC prompting within one mile of the departure airport.

;"Radar vectors San Jose": The departure controller will provide directional guidance to the San Jose VOR.

;"Then as filed.": After arriving at the San Jose VOR, the pilot will likely resume navigation without ATC prompts along the airways and intersections that were filed in their flight plan.

;"Maintain three thousand ...": After takeoff, climb to an indicated altitude of 3000 feet above sea level.

;"... expect five thousand five minutes after departure.": The next altitude assignment is probably going to be 5000 feet above sea level.  However, pilots must follow actual ATC altitude assignments throughout the flight.  This portion of the clearance provides a backup if communications are lost, allowing the flight to continue and climb to 5000 feet.

;"Departure frequency is one two one decimal three.": After the aircraft is airborne and the tower controller tells the pilot to "contact departure", pilots are to contact the departure controller on this communication frequency.

;"Squawk four two six three.": The pilot should set the aircraft's transponder code to 4263 so that ATC can positively identify the flight on radar.

The clearance scheme, used by ATC, can be easily remembered using the acronym
;"CRAFT":'''C'''learance Limit - '''R'''oute - '''A'''ltitudes - '''F'''requencies - '''T'''ransponder (Squawk)

En route flight is described by IFR charts showing navigation aids, fixes, and standard routes called ''[[Airway (aviation)|airways]]''. Aircraft with appropriate navigational equipment such as GPS, are also often cleared for a ''direct-to'' routing, where only the destination, or a few navigational waypoints are used to describe the route that the flight will follow. ATC will assign altitudes in its initial clearance or amendments thereto, and navigational charts indicate minimum safe altitudes for airways.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The approach portion of an IFR flight may begin with a [[standard terminal arrival route]] (STAR), describing common routes to fly to arrive at an [[initial approach fix]] (IAF) from which an [[instrument approach]] commences. 
An instrument approach terminates either by the pilot acquiring sufficient visual reference to proceed to the runway, or with a [[missed approach]] because the required visual reference is not seen in time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Qualifications==

===Pilot===
To fly under IFR, a pilot must have an [[instrument rating]] and must be ''current'' (meet recency of experience requirements).
In the United States, to file and fly under IFR, a pilot must be instrument-rated and, within the preceding six months, have flown six [[instrument approach]]es, as well as [[holding (aviation)|holding]] procedures and course interception and tracking with [[navaid]]s. Flight under IFR beyond six months after meeting these requirements is not permitted; however, currency may be reestablished within the next six months by completing the requirements above. Beyond the twelfth month, examination ("instrument proficiency check") by an instructor is required.&lt;ref&gt;US Code of Federal Regulations, 14 CFR 61.57(c) and (d)&lt;/ref&gt;

Practicing instrument approaches can be done either in the [[instrument meteorological conditions]] or in [[visual meteorological conditions]] – in the latter case, a [[safety pilot]] is required so that the pilot practicing instrument approaches can wear a view-limiting device which restricts his field of view to the instrument panel. A safety pilot's primary duty is to observe and avoid other traffic.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

For all [[Instrument landing system#ILS categories|ILS Cat II or Cat III]] approaches, additional crew training is required and a certain number of low visibility approaches must either be performed or simulated within a fixed time for pilots to be 'current' in performing them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In the UK, an IR (UK restricted) - formerly the "IMC rating" - which permits flight under IFR in airspace classes B to G in instrument meteorological conditions, a non-instrument-rated pilot can also elect to fly under IFR in visual meteorological conditions outside controlled airspace. Compared to the rest of the world, the UK's flight crew licensing regime is somewhat unusual in its licensing for meteorological conditions and airspace, rather than flight rules.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Aircraft===
The aircraft must be equipped and type-certified for instrument flight, and the related navigational equipment must have been inspected or tested within a specific period of time prior to the instrument flight.

In the United States, instruments required for IFR flight in addition to those that are required for VFR flight are: [[heading indicator]], [[altimeter|sensitive altimeter]] adjustable for [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]], [[clock]] with a sweep-second pointer or digital equivalent, [[attitude indicator]], [[airband|radios]] and suitable [[avionics]] for the route to be flown, [[alternator]] or [[electrical generator|generator]], [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] rate-of-turn indicator that is either a [[turn coordinator]] or the [[turn and bank indicator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2009-title14-vol2/pdf/CFR-2009-title14-vol2-sec91-205.pdf|title=14 CFR 91.205|author=|date=|website=gpo.gov|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1999 single-engine helicopters could not be FAA-certified for IFR, and [[Helicopter Association International]] estimates that 326 lives were lost in 133 accidents that would likely not have happened if those helicopters had been flying under IFR.&lt;ref name=vert2015-04&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Hirschberg |url=http://www.verticalmag.com/digital_issue/2015/v14i2/files/12.html |title=Resurrecting single-engine helicopter IFR |work=Vertical Magazine |date=April–May 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419022931/http://www.verticalmag.com/digital_issue/2015/v14i2/files/12.html |archive-date=2015-04-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kista''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈɕiːsta}}) is a district in the [[Districts of Sweden#Stockholm|borough]] of [[Rinkeby-Kista]], [[Stockholm Municipality|Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. It has a strategic position located in between Sweden's main airport, the [[Stockholm Arlanda Airport|Stockholm-Arlanda International Airport]] and central Stockholm, and alongside the main [[European route E4|national highway E4]] economic artery. Kista comprises residential and commercial areas, the latter in the highly technological [[telecommunication]] and [[information technology]] industry.&lt;ref name="OECD2013"/&gt; There are large research efforts in this entire area, which therefore is dubbed Kista Science City. It is known{{By whom?|date=October 2017}} as the research park of [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]].

Kista is the largest [[Information and communications technology|Information and Communications Technology (ICT)]] cluster in Europe,&lt;ref name="kista.com"&gt;http://www.kista.com&lt;/ref&gt; and the world's second largest&lt;ref&gt;Page 84.

It is the largest corporate area in Sweden, important to the national economy&lt;ref name="Kim2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kim|first=Junmo|title=Globalization and Industrial Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__lZdK1S4OkC&amp;pg=PA73|date=10 July 2005|isbn=978-1-4697-2393-8|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the presence of, among others, [[Ericsson Group]], the largest corporation in Sweden.

Kista Science City is the location where a large portion of the research and development of the world's [[LTE (telecommunication)|4G LTE]] mobile telephony infrastructure is being developed, a European [[ETSI]] standard used worldwide and Kista Science City has been the largest such cluster in Europe for decades.{{When?|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref name="kista.com"/&gt; A majority is done at [[Ericsson|Ericsson corporation]], with 100,000 employees worldwide, but with its research and worldwide Headquarters in the Kista Science City.

Kista was named after an old farm "Kista Gård", still located in the area. The construction of the modern parts were started in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="AntonellaEmma2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Antonella|first1=Noya|last2=Emma|first2=Clarence|last3=Gary|first3=Craig|title=Local Economic and Employment Development (LEED) Community Capacity Building Creating a Better Future Together: Creating a Better Future Together|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_TFVEFrqSsC&amp;pg=PA119|date=7 December 2009|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-07329-6|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the streets in Kista are named after towns and places in [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], and [[Faroe Islands]]. Before the opening of the [[Mall of Scandinavia]], [[Kista Galleria]] was the biggest shopping center in the [[Stockholm County|Stockholm region]]. 
Because of its [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] industries, it became in the 1980s referred to as "Chipsta"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=Z-dXAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Chipsta+kista&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8qjzjkswI8&amp;sig=ZCf-NhrPh8iVUvsLFXXgD6OkEco&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiMjKqUu87eAhVJqIsKHQ89CrkQ6AEwDXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Chipsta%20kista&amp;f=false|title=Urban Innovation Systems: What makes them tick?|last=Winden|first=Willem van|last2=Braun|first2=Erik|last3=Otgaar|first3=Alexander|last4=Witte|first4=Jan-Jelle|date=2014-04-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317917458|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, after Sweden joined the EU in 1995, also as Europe's "Silicon Valley".&lt;ref name="AntonellaEmma2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordichardware.se/Coverage/overclocking-at-intel.html|title=Overclocking at Intel|publisher=Nordichardware.se|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
Kista is the largest corporate area in Sweden and important to the national economy.&lt;ref name="OECD2013"&gt;{{cite book|title=OECD Green Growth Studies Green Growth in Stockholm, Sweden|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4G3oCqJJJScC&amp;pg=PA70|date=23 May 2013|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-19515-8|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The construction of the industrial section of Kista began in the 1970s with companies such as SRA (Svenska Radioaktiebolaget, now a part of [[Ericsson]]), RIFA AB (later Ericsson Components AB, and later still Ericsson Microelectronics AB, and now Infineon Technologies), and IBM Svenska AB (the Swedish branch of [[International Business Machines|IBM]]). [[Ericsson]] has had its headquarters in Kista since 2003.&lt;ref name="Kim2005"/&gt;

== Research and higher learning ==

Kista hosts entire departments of both [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]], such as Wireless@KTH, and [[Stockholm University]] (formerly jointly known as "the IT University").&lt;ref name="DesaiNijkamp2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Sameeksha Desai|Desai]]|first1=Sameeksha|last2=Nijkamp|first2=Peter|last3=Stough|first3=Roger R.|title=New Directions in Regional Economic Development: The Role of Entrepreneurship Theory and Methods, Practice and Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6eY4LtrIOcC&amp;pg=PA249|date=July 2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-0-85793-351-5|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also Swedish national research institutes (pure research, no students) such as the [[Swedish Institute of Computer Science]] and [[Swedish Defence Research Agency|Swedish Defence Research Agency, FOI]] who has its Headquarters there, just as [[Ericsson]],  [[IBM|Swedish IBM]] and [[Tele 2]], among others has.

Also the Swedish Co-location Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eitdigital.eu/about-us/locations/stockholm-node/|title=EIT Digital Stockholm Node|last=|first=|date=|work=EIT Digital corporate website|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; of EU innovation and entrepreneurial education organisation [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology|EIT]] Digital is located in Kista and offers a 2-year Master program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/program/TIVNM/20182/genomforande?l=en|title=Master's Programme, ICT Innovation, 120 credits (TIVNM), Programme syllabus for studies starting in autumn 2018, Implementation of the education {{!}} KTH|website=www.kth.se|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in colaboration with [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]].

A '''ladle transfer car''' is a [[material handling]] tool which is used in [[foundries]]. The car carries a metal [[ladle (metallurgy)|ladle]], typically torpedo-shaped (with two pointed ends), from one location to another for processing molten liquid metal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transfer-cart.com] ''special transfer cart on-rail''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hundred-percent.com.cn/product/454258866-210247392/KPT_50T_ladle_transfer_trailer_for_steel_plant.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120908021822/http://www.hundred-percent.com.cn/product/454258866-210247392/KPT_50T_ladle_transfer_trailer_for_steel_plant.html |archivedate=2012-09-08 |df= }}''ladle transfer trailer for steel plant''&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be called a '''molten steel transporter''' or a '''Tundish transfer car'''.

The ladle is placed on rail trucks but can be removed to pour out the molten liquid.

[[Image:Mangle.jpg|thumb|A Norahammars Bruk model 3005-2 mangle from 1934]]
A '''mangle''' or '''wringer''' is a mechanical laundry aid consisting of two rollers in a sturdy frame, connected by cogs and, in its home version, powered by a hand crank or electricity. While the appliance was originally used to wring water from wet laundry, today mangles are used to press or flatten sheets, tablecloths, kitchen towels, or clothing and other laundry.

== History ==

===Clothes press===
[[File:Mangling av tøy Foto Norsk Folkemuseum 1962, NF.06675-006.jpg|thumb|With the dominant hand on the handle and the other hand on the mangle, the user presses on the roll while it is pushed back and forth. Photo: Norwegian Folk Museum 1962]]The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' dates the first use of the word in English from 1598, quoting [[John Florio]] who, in his 1598 dictionary, ''A World of Words'', described "a kind of press to press buckram, fustian, or dyed linen cloth, to make it have a luster or gloss." The word comes from the Dutch ''mangel'', from ''mangelen'' "to mangle", which in turn derives from the medieval Latin ''mango'' or ''manga'' which ultimately comes from the Greek ''manganon'', meaning "axis" or "engine".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some northern European countries used a table version for centuries, the device consisting of the rolling pin, a wood cylinder around which the damp cloth was wrapped, and the mangle board, a curved or flat length of wood which was used to roll and flatten the cloth. The oldest known model is a Norwegian mangle board, found near [[Bergen]] and dated 1444&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mangle boards of Scandinavia, Germany and the Netherlands|url=https://www.mangleboard.com/|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the second half of the 19th century, commercial laundries began using steam-powered mangles or ironers. Gradually, the electric washing machine's spin cycle rendered this use of a mangle obsolete, and with it the need to wring out water from clothes mechanically. [[Box mangle]]s were large and primarily intended for pressing laundry smooth; they were used by wealthy households, large commercial laundries, and self-employed "mangle women". Middle-class households and independent washerwomen used upright mangles for wringing water out of laundry, and in the later 19th century they were more widely used than early washing machines. The rollers were typically made of wood, or sometimes [[rubber]].

The Steel Roll Mangle Co. of 108 Franklin Street, Chicago, Illinois offered a gas heated home mangle for pressing linens in 1902. In the 1930s electric mangles were developed and are still a feature of many laundry rooms. They consist of a rotating padded drum which revolves against a heating element which can be stationary, or can also be a rotating drum. Laundry is fed into the turning mangle and emerges flat and pressed on the other side. This process takes much less time than [[ironing]] with the usual [[Iron (appliance)|iron]] and ironing board.

There were many electric rotary ironers on the American market including Solent, Thor, Ironrite and Apex. By the 1940s the list had grown to include Bendix, General Electric, Kenmore and Maytag.&lt;ref&gt;It is thought the Maytag machine was produced by Bendix with a Maytag name&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950s home ironers or mangles as they came to be called were becoming popular time savers for the homemaker.

===Drying clothes===
[[File:Mangle at the Apprentice House, Quarry Bank Mill.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Mangle on display at the Apprentice House at the [[Quarry Bank Mill]] in the UK.]]
When home [[washing machine]]s were first invented, they were just for washing: a tub on legs or wheels. A hand-cranked mangle appeared on top after 1843 when John E. Turnbull of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] patented a "Clothes Washer With Wringer Rolls."&lt;ref&gt;Mario Theriault, ''Great Maritime Inventions 1833-1950'', Goose Lane, 2001, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The first geared wringer mangle in the UK is thought to date to about 1850, when one was invented by Robert Tasker of [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taskers.com/Info1.asp?Key=6   Taskers history] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914002112/http://www.taskers.com/Info1.asp?Key=6 |date=September 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a smaller, upright version of the [[box mangle]].

== Current use ==
[[File:Modern mangle in a Swedish laundry room.jpg|alt=An electric mangle is a chest-high, rectangular cabinet with an opening in the front. From the opening, a long sheet of cloth nearly as wide as the machine spills out into a tray below. Controls at the right of the front face of the machine operate a light which illuminates the opening, and the feed of the cloth in and out of the mangle.|thumb|A modern, motorized mangle in a residential building's [[tvättstuga|laundry room in Sweden]].]]
Small domestic pressing mangles may be more common in some countries than in others. They are typically not sold in North American home appliance stores or departments. In contrast to their use in homes, mangles have become an essential feature of commercial or large-scale laundries. They are typically used to press flat items such as sheets or tablecloths, and also are far quicker and more energy-efficient for removing most of the water than a [[clothes dryer]]. Skilled operators can also press shirts and pants (trousers) on a mangle.

With some modification, they make an inexpensive alternative to an etching/relief [[printing press]].

A significant benefit of mangling is reduced dust. When washing, the ends of the surface fibers tend to loosen and stick out when dried. The clothes are then much more sensitive to trap dust, dirt and grease, and to shed off fibers. Mangling presses the fiber ends back onto the fiber, so that the clothes remain clean longer. This can reduce dust as much as 10-60 times.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Mangles are most often used for bed sheets, tablecloths and towels, which would be time-consuming to iron by hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3544">'''Mary Macaulay''' (January 27, 1865 – July 19, 1944) was a [[telegraph]] operator and labor union official who became International Vice President of the [[Commercial Telegraphers Union of America]] (CTUA) in 1919. She was the first woman telegrapher to hold a national elective office in a union.
[[File:Macaulay 2.jpg|thumb|right|Mary Macaulay, International Vice President, Commercial Telegraphers Union of America. Source: ''Commercial Telegraphers' Journal'', 1919, p. 458.]]

==Involvement with telegraphers' unions and the suffrage movement==

In about 1880, she began work as a commercial operator for [[Western Union]].  She joined the telegraphers' union, the Brotherhood of Telegraphers, which was affiliated with the [[Knights of Labor]].  She joined in their strike against Western Union in 1883. When the strike ended unsuccessfully, she left Western Union and began work as a press operator in [[Amsterdam, New York]], where she sent and received press dispatches.  This was the beginning of a long career as a press telegrapher; she subsequently operated for the ''Rochester Post Express'' in [[Rochester, New York]], the Consolidated wire at the ''[[Buffalo Evening News]]'' in [[Buffalo, New York]], and for the [[United Press Association]] in the offices of the ''Lockport Union Sun'' in [[Lockport, New York]]. While in Lockport, she was elected vice president of Local 41 of the CTUA.&lt;ref&gt;“Miss Mary J. Macaulay of Lockport”, ''Commercial Telegraphers Journal'', February 1910: 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Macaulay was an early supporter of the [[women's suffrage movement]]; during her employment in Rochester, she also served as secretary to [[Susan B. Anthony]].&lt;ref&gt;“Miss Mary J. Macaulay”, ''New York Times'' obituary, July 21, 1944: 584-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1919 strike and election as international vice president==

In June, 1919, the CTUA went on strike against Western Union after the telegraph company discharged several telegraphers for belonging to the union. However, the strike was unsuccessful; after the union's president, S. J. Konenkamp, resigned, a new slate of officers was elected, including 
Mary Macaulay, who became International Vice President.  One of her first actions was to set up a defense fund for strikers who had been arrested in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In the following year, federal charges against the strikers were dropped. She served as International Vice President until 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Jepsen, Thomas C., ''My Sisters Telegraphic: Women in the Telegraph Office'', 2000, Ohio University Press, pp. 182-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and retirement==

In 1927, she retired from her work as press telegrapher for the ''Lockport Union Sun'' and returned to [[LeRoy, New York]]. She was an active member of Saint Peter's Catholic Church in that city, and left her entire estate to the church in her will.

; Playlist Exchange. : The NCS can build and transfer playlist information to the MOS.  This allows the NCS to control the sequence that media objects are played or presented by the MOS.
; Status Exchange. : The MOS can inform the NCS of the status of specific clips or the MOS system in general.  The NCS can notify the MOS of the status of specific playlist items or running orders.

MOS was developed to reduce the need for the development of [[Device driver|device specific drivers]]. By allowing developers to embed functionality and handle events, vendors were relieved of the burden of developing device drivers. It was left to the manufacturers to interface newsroom computer systems. This approach affords broadcasters flexibility to purchase equipment from multiple vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmaker.us/TheMOSStory.html |title=Newsmaker |publisher=Newsmaker.us |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also limits the need to have [[Computer operator|operators]] in multiple locations throughout the studio as, for example, multiple [[character generator]]s (CG) can be fired from a single control [[workstation]], without needing an operator at each CG console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topic/Media_Object_Server |title=Media Object Server – eNotes.com Reference |publisher=Enotes.com |date=2002-03-21 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOS enables [[journalists]] to see, use, and control media devices inside [[Associated Press]]'s [[ENPS]] system so that individual pieces of newsroom [[Video production|production]] technology speak a common [[XML]]-based language.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author=WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois, USA |url=http://www.enps.com/pages/enps_integration/what_is_mos |title=ENPS and MOS |publisher=Enps.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of MOS ==

The first meeting of the MOS protocol development group occurred at the [[Associated Press]] [[ENPS]] developer's conference in [[Orlando, Florida]] in 1998. The fundamental concepts of MOS were released to the public domain at that conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosprotocol.com/mos_faq.htm#MOS_group |title=Mos Faq |publisher=Mosprotocol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an [[open protocol]], the MOS Development Group encourages the participation of broadcast equipment vendors and their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mosprotocol.com/how_to_participate_in_mos.htm |title=How to Participate in MOS |publisher=Mosprotocol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927040738/http://www.mosprotocol.com/how_to_participate_in_mos.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 companies are said to work with AP on MOS-related projects. Compatible hardware and software includes [[video editing]], [[File server|storage]] and [[Content management system|management]]; [[Broadcast automation|automation]]; machine control; [[Teleprompter|prompters]]; character generators; [[Digital audio editor|audio editing]], store and management; [[web publishing]], [[Interactive television|interactive TV]], [[Electronic field production|field transmission]] and [[Motion graphics|graphics]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Current development is happening on two tracks: a [[Network socket|socket-based]] version, and a [[web service]] version. The current official versions of the MOS protocol, as of January 2011, are 2.8.4 (sockets) and 3.8.4 (web service).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosprotocol.com/MOS%20Files/2.8.4/MOS_Protocol_Version_2.8.4.htm |title=MOS Protocol 2.8.4 (Current) |publisher=Mosprotocol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 proposals began to introduce IP Video support in the MOS protocol. This proposal allows representations of live IP Video sources such as NDI ([[Network Device Interface]]) to be included as MOS objects alongside MOS objects representing files to be played off disk&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sienna-tv.com/ndi/ndimonitor.html|title=NDIMonitor|website=www.sienna-tv.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] based implementation called jmos that is currently compatible with MOS specification 2.8.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/jmos/ |title=jmos – Open java implementation for Media Object Server Communications Protocol (MOS) – Google Project Hosting |publisher=Code.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences awarded an Emmy to the MOS Group for "Development and Standardization of Media Object Server (MOS) Protocol."&lt;ref&gt;http://mosprotocol.com/forums/topic/mos-emmy-statues-nominations-and-voting/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Motorola Timeport L7089.jpg|thumb|[[Motorola]] Timeport, the first tri-band mobile phone (1999)]]
In [[telecommunications]], a '''multi-band device''' (including '''dual-band''', '''tri-band''', '''quad-band''' and '''penta-band''' devices) is a communication device (especially a [[mobile phone]]) that supports multiple [[radio frequency]] bands. All devices which have more than one channel use multiple frequencies; a band however is a group of frequencies containing many channels. Multiple bands in mobile devices support [[roaming]] between different regions where different standards are used for mobile telephone services. Where the bands are widely separated in frequency, parallel transmit and receive signal path circuits must be provided, which increases the cost, complexity and power demand of multi-band devices.

The term '''quad-band''' describes a device that supports four frequency bands: 850 and 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz, mostly used in [[the Americas]] ([[ITU region]] 2), and the 900 and 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz bands used elsewhere.  Most [[GSM]]/[[UMTS]] phones support all four bands, while most [[CDMA2000]]/1xRTT phones (mostly North America and voice transmission only) do not, and so are considered only '''dual-band''' devices.  A few phones support both of the domestic frequencies but only one foreign one for limited [[roaming]], making them '''tri-band''' phones.

The term '''penta-band''' describes a device that supports a fifth frequency band, commonly the 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz band in much of the world.  The [[Advanced Wireless Services]] (AWS) 1700&amp;nbsp;MHz band also seeing increased usage.

==4G LTE bands==
In the [[United States]] only, the two largest carriers are instead implementing 4G LTE in the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band, which was reallocated from [[TV broadcasting]] during the [[digital television transition in the United States|DTV transition]].  [[TV station]]s were forced to move to lower [[UHF]] and even far worse [[VHF]] frequencies with poorer [[mobile TV]] and even regular [[terrestrial TV]] performance{{Citation needed|reason=UHF has no poorer reception that UHF with roof-top antennas. The DTV transition did not address mobile TV signals. Some TV stations, such as KGO-TV, broadcasting analog on VHF, elected to remain VHF after the transition, and broadcast UHF during the transition; the FCC offered such stations the choice between VHF and UHF.|date=October 2013}}, because the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band has better [[radio propagation]] characteristics that allow [[mobile phone signal]] to penetrate deeper into buildings with less [[attenuation]] than the 1700&amp;nbsp;MHz or 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz bands.

[[AT&amp;T Mobility]] devices use former [[TV channel]] 55 nationwide (purchased from [[Qualcomm]]'s defunct [[MediaFLO]] [[pay TV]] service), and also channel 56 in densely populated areas such as [[California]] and the [[Northeast Corridor]].  [[Verizon Wireless]] holds frequencies just above TV channel 51, which is still in use, causing [[adjacent-channel interference]] that is preventing the carrier from using them until the planned top-down [[spectrum repacking]] occurs.  It more recently acquired higher blocks within the former TV band, which it plans to use first.

[[Image:Rapala.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rapala]] Original Floater in Clown Pattern]]
The '''Original Floater''' is a [[wobbler (fishing)|wobbler]] type of [[fishing lure]], manufactured by [[Rapala]]. It is the first lure created by founder [[Lauri Rapala]], in [[Finland]] in 1936. It was made of [[Cork (material)|cork]], and wrapped in [[tinfoil]] from cheese and chocolate, and covered in melted [[film negative]]s as a cheap alternative to [[lacquer]].

Today, the original floater is made in seven different sizes and fourteen different colors. It can be found in many anglers' [[Fishing_tackle#Tackle_boxes|tackle box]]es, and is the best-selling lure Rapala makes, and possibly best-selling in the world.

The lure, when retrieved, swims with an action that mimics that of a wounded [[Bait fish|baitfish]]. It was designed this way by Lauri Rapala, because of his observations as a boy and young man of the behaviors of [[minnow]]s and fish in lakes near his home in Finland, where he noticed that in a school of minnows, an [[injury|injured]] minnow swimming with an odd wobble made it the target of a larger fish looking for a meal.

After seeing this, he crafted this lure, with the help of some of his friends, originally to help him catch more fish without having to constantly re[[Bait (luring substance)|bait]] the thousands of [[Fishin hook|hook]]s he had used to catch [[pike (fish)|pike]] and [[perch]]. But his lures, being quite good at catching fish compared to conventional methods of the time, made its way around the world, increasing in popularity, so that the whole Rapala family had to help with creating these lures. Lauri's sons learned to make the lures, and became so skilled that one of his sons, Ensio, won a national craftsmanship award for his lure. The same son also invented a machine to help mass production of this lure.

'''Pentazole''' is an [[aromatic]] chemical molecule consisting of a five-membered ring with all nitrogen atoms, one of which is bonded to a hydrogen atom.  It has a molecular formula HN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Although strictly speaking a homocyclic, inorganic compound, pentazole has historically been classed as the last in a series of heterocyclic [[azole]] compounds containing one to five nitrogen atoms. This set contains [[pyrrole]], [[imidazole]], [[pyrazole]], [[triazole]]s, [[tetrazole]], and pentazole.

==Derivatives==
Substituted analogs of pentazole are collectively known as pentazoles.  As a class, they are unstable and often highly explosive compounds.  The first pentazole synthesized was [[phenylpentazole]], where the pentazole ring is highly stabilized by [[conjugated system|conjugation]] with the phenyl ring.  The derivative [[4-Dimethylaminophenylpentazole|4-dimethylaminophenylpentazole]] is among the most stable pentazole compounds known, although it still decomposes at temperatures over 50&amp;nbsp;°C.  It is known that [[Polar effect|electron-donating groups]] stabilize [[aryl]] pentazole compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burke|first=L. A.|author2=Fazen P.

The cyclic '''pentazolium''' cation ({{chem|N|5|+}}) is not known due to its probable antiaromatic character; whereas the open-chained [[pentazenium]] cation ({{chem|N|5|+}}) is known. Butler ''et al.''  first demonstrated the presence of the cyclic {{chem|N|5|-}} in solution through the decomposition of substituted aryl pentazoles at low temperature. The presence of {{chem|N|5|H|}} and {{chem|N|5|-}} (held in solution through the interaction with zinc ions) was proven primarily using &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N NMR techniques of the decomposition products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayHTMLArticleforfree.cfm?JournalCode=CC&amp;Year=2003&amp;ManuscriptID=b301491f&amp;Iss=8 | doi = 10.1039/b301491f| title = First generation of pentazole (HN5, pentazolic acid), the final azole, and a zinc pentazolate salt in solution: A new N-dearylation of 1-(p-methoxyphenyl) pyrazoles, a 2-(p-methoxyphenyl) tetrazole and application of the methodology to 1-(p-methoxyphenyl) pentazole | journal = Chemical Communications| issue = 8| pages = 1016| year = 2003| last1 = Butler| first1 = R.

The mechanism predicted four different regimes where each reaction takes place. The third reaction, known as radical consumption layer, where most of the heat is released, and the first reaction also known as fuel consumption layer occurs in a narrow region at the flame. The fourth reaction is the [[hydrogen]] [[oxidation]] layer, whose thickness is much larger than the former two layers. Finally, the [[Carbon Monoxide]] [[oxidation]] layer is largest of all, corresponding to the second reaction, oxidizes very slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0010-2180(88)90051-X|title=Asymptotic structure and extinction of methane-air diffusion flames|journal=Combustion and Flame|volume=73|pages=23–44|year=1988|last1=Seshadri|first1=K.|last2=Peters|first2=N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0010-2180(90)90058-Y|title=The inner structure of methane-air flames|journal=Combustion and Flame|volume=81|issue=2|pages=96–118|year=1990|last1=Seshadri|first1=K.|last2=Peters|first2=N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Picotux''' is one of the smallest [[computer]]s running [[Linux]].  There are several different kinds of picotux available, but the main one is the '''picotux 100'''.  It is 35&amp;nbsp;mm × 19&amp;nbsp;mm × 19&amp;nbsp;mm and just barely larger than an [[8P8C]] modular connector. Two communication interfaces are provided, 10/100 [[Mbit/s]] half/full duplex [[Ethernet]] and a serial port with up to 230,400 bit/s. Five additional lines can be used for either general input/output or serial handshaking.

The picotux 100 operates a 55 [[MHz]] [[32-bit]] [[ARM7]] Netsilicon NS7520 [[Central processing unit|processor]], with 2 MB of [[Flash Memory]] (750 KB of which contains the OS) and 8 MB [[SDRAM]] Memory. The [[operating system]] is [[μClinux]] 2.4.27 [[Big Endian]]. [[BusyBox]] 1.0 is used as main [[Unix shell|shell]]. The picotux system runs at 250 m[[Ampere|A]] only and 3.3 [[Volt|V]] +/- 5%.

[[Image:Polythiophenes fluorescence NMR tube.jpg|thumb|Polythiophenes demonstrate interesting optical properties resulting from their conjugated backbone, as demonstrated by the [[fluorescence]] of a substituted polythiophene solution under UV irradiation.]]

'''Polythiophenes''' (PTs) are [[polymer]]ized [[thiophene]]s, a [[sulfur]] [[heterocyclic compound|heterocycle]]. They can become [[Conductive polymer|conducting]] when oxidized.  The study of polythiophenes and related conductive polymers was recognized by the awarding of the 2000 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] to [[Alan J. Heeger]], [[Alan MacDiarmid]], and [[Hideki Shirakawa]] "for the discovery and development of conductive polymers". The most notable property of these materials, [[electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]], results from the [[Delocalized electron|delocalization of electrons]] along the polymer backbone – hence the term "synthetic metals". Conductivity however is not the only interesting property resulting from electron delocalization. The optical properties of these materials respond to environmental stimuli, with dramatic color shifts in response to changes in [[solvent]], [[temperature]], [[Electric potential|applied potential]], and binding to other molecules. Changes in both color and conductivity are induced by the same mechanism, twisting of the polymer backbone and disrupting conjugation, making conjugated polymers attractive as [[Sensor#Chemical sensors|sensors]] that can provide a range of optical and electronic responses.

A number of comprehensive [[review]]s have been published on PTs, the earliest dating from 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Street |first1=G. B. |last2=Clarke |first2=T.

==Mechanism of conductivity and doping==
Electrons are delocalized along the conjugated backbones of conducting polymers, usually through overlap of π-orbitals, resulting in an extended π-system with a filled valence band. By removing electrons from the π-system ("p-doping"), or adding electrons into the π-system ("n-doping"), a charged unit called a [[bipolaron]] is formed (see Figure 1). [[Image:Polythiophenes Bipolaron.png|frame|'''Figure 1.''' Removal of two electrons (p-doping) from a PT chain produces a bipolaron.]] Doping is performed at much higher levels (20–40%) in conducting polymers than in semiconductors (&lt;1%). The bipolaron moves as a unit along the polymer chain, and is responsible for the macroscopically observed conductivity of the polymer. For some samples of [[poly(3-dodecylthiophene)]] doped with [[iodine]], the conductivity can approach 1000 S/cm.&lt;ref name="mccullough_etal_1993"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja00064a070|title=Self-orienting head-to-tail poly(3-alkylthiophenes): new insights on structure-property relationships in conducting polymers|year=1993|last1=McCullough|first1=Richard D.|last2=Tristram-Nagle|first2=Stephanie|last3=Williams|first3=Shawn P.|last4=Lowe|first4=Renae D.|last5=Jayaraman|first5=Manikandan|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=115|pages=4910|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In comparison, the conductivity of [[copper]] is approximately 5×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; S/cm.) Generally, the conductivity of PTs is lower than 1000 S/cm, but high conductivity is not necessary for many applications of conducting polymers (see [[Polythiophene#Applications|below]] for examples).

Simultaneous oxidation of the conducting polymer and introduction of counterions, p-doping, can be accomplished [[Electrochemistry|electrochemically]] or [[Chemistry|chemically]]. During the electrochemical synthesis of a PT, counterions dissolved in the solvent can associate with the polymer as it is deposited onto the electrode in its oxidized form. By doping the polymer as it is synthesized, a thick film can build up on an electrode—the polymer conducts electrons from the substrate to the surface of the film. Alternatively, a neutral conducting polymer film or solution can be doped post-synthesis.

Reduction of the conducting polymer, n-doping, is much less common than p-doping. An early study of electrochemical n-doping of [[poly(bithiophene)]] found that the n-doping levels are less than those of p-doping, the n-doping cycles were less efficient, the number of cycles required to reach maximum doping was higher, and the n-doping process appeared to be kinetically limited, possibly due to counterion diffusion in the polymer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0013-4686(90)87029-2|title=Electrochemical characterization of "n" doped polyheterocyclic conducting polymers—I.

A variety of reagents have been used to dope PTs. [[Iodine]] and [[bromine]] produce highly conductive materials,&lt;ref name="mccullough_etal_1993" /&gt; which are unstable owing to slow evaporation of the halogen.&lt;ref name="loponen_etal_1991"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0379-6779(91)91111-M|title=Doping and dedoping processes in poly (3-alkylthiophenes)|year=1991|last1=Loponen|first1=M. |last2=Taka|first2=T. |last3=Laakso|first3=J. |last4=Vakiparta|first4=K. |last5=Suuronen|first5=K. |last6=Valkeinen|first6=P. |last7=Osterholm|first7=J. |journal=Synthetic Metals|volume=41|pages=479}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organic acid]]s, including [[trifluoroacetic acid]], [[propanoic acid|propionic acid]], and [[Sulfonic acid#Sulfonic acids|sulfonic acids]] produce PTs with lower conductivities than iodine, but with higher environmental stabilities.&lt;ref name="loponen_etal_1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bartuš |first=Ján |title=Electrically Conducting Thiophene Polymers |journal=Journal of Macromolecular Science A |year=1991 |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=917–924 |doi=10.1080/00222339108054069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxidative polymerization with [[iron(III) chloride|ferric chloride]] can result in doping by residual [[catalysis|catalyst]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0379-6779(00)00587-7|title=The FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-doped poly(3-alkyithiophenes) in solid state|year=2001|last1=Qiao|first1=X. |journal=Synthetic Metals|volume=122|pages=449|issue=2|last2=Wang|first2=Xianhong|last3=Mo|first3=Zhishen}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] [[mass spectrometry]] (MALDI-MS) studies have shown that poly(3-hexylthiophene)s are also partially halogenated by the residual oxidizing agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ma002140z|title=MALDI-MS Evaluation of Poly(3-hexylthiophene) Synthesized by Chemical Oxidation with FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|year=2001|last1=McCarley|first1=Tracy Donovan|last2=Noble|last3=Dubois |first3=C.

==Structure and optical properties==

===Conjugation length and chromisms===
The extended π-systems of conjugated PTs produce some of the most interesting properties of these materials—their optical properties. As an approximation, the conjugated backbone can be considered as a real-world example of the "electron-in-a-box" solution to the [[Schrödinger equation]]; however, the development of refined models to accurately predict [[Absorption spectroscopy|absorption]] and [[Fluorescence spectroscopy|fluorescence]] spectra of well-defined oligo(thiophene) systems is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;Bässler, H. "Electronic Excitation". In ''Electronic Materials: The Oligomer Approach''; Müllen, K.; Wegner, G., Eds.; Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, Germany, 1998, {{ISBN|3-527-29438-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conjugation relies upon overlap of the π-orbitals of the [[Aromaticity|aromatic rings]], which, in turn, requires the thiophene rings to be coplanar (see Figure 2, top). [[Image:Polythiophenes Conjugation.png|frame|'''Figure 2.''' Conjugated π-orbitals of a coplanar and a twisted substituted PT.]] The number of coplanar rings determines the conjugation length—the longer the conjugation length, the lower the separation between adjacent [[energy level]]s, and the longer the absorption wavelength. Deviation from coplanarity may be permanent, resulting from mislinkages during synthesis or especially bulky [[side chain]]s; or temporary, resulting from changes in the environment or binding. This twist in the backbone reduces the conjugation length (see Figure 2, bottom), and the separation between energy levels is increased. This results in a shorter absorption wavelength.

Determining the maximum effective conjugation length requires the synthesis of regioregular PTs of defined length. The absorption band in the visible region is increasingly [[Bathochromic shift|red-shifted]] as the conjugation length increases, and the maximum effective conjugation length is calculated as the saturation point of the red-shift. Early studies by ten Hoeve ''et al.'' estimated that the effective conjugation extended over 11 repeat units,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja00015a067|title=Substituted .. – undecithiophenes, the longest characterized oligothiophenes|year=1991|last1=Ten Hoeve|first1=W.|last2=Wynberg|first2=H.|last3=Havinga|first3=E.

A variety of environmental factors can cause the conjugated backbone to twist, reducing the conjugation length and causing an absorption band shift, including solvent, temperature, application of an electric field, and dissolved [[ion]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The absorption band of poly ([[3-Thiophene acetic acid|3-thiophene acetic acid]]) in aqueous solutions of [[Polyvinyl alcohol|poly(vinyl alcohol)]] (PVA) shifts from 480&amp;nbsp;nm at [[pH]] 7 to 415&amp;nbsp;nm at pH 4.

Shifts in PT absorption bands due to changes in temperature result from a conformational transition from a coplanar, rodlike structure at lower temperatures to a nonplanar, coiled structure at elevated temperatures. For example, poly(3-(octyloxy)-4-methylthiophene) undergoes a color change from red–violet at 25&amp;nbsp;°C to pale yellow at 150&amp;nbsp;°C. An [[isosbestic point]] (a point where the absorbance curves at all temperatures overlap) indicates coexistence between two phases, which may exist on the same chain or on different chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ma00034a012|title=Rod-to-coil transition in alkoxy-substituted polythiophenes|year=1992|last1=Roux|first1=Claudine|last2=Leclerc|first2=Mario|journal=Macromolecules|volume=25|pages=2141|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all thermochromic PTs exhibit an isosbestic point: highly regioregular poly(3-alkylthiophene)s (PATs) show a continuous blue-shift with increasing temperature if the side chains are short enough so that they do not melt and interconvert between crystalline and disordered phases at low temperatures.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Regioregularity===
The asymmetry of 3-substituted thiophenes results in three possible couplings when two monomers are linked between the 2- and the 5-positions. These couplings are: 
*2,5', or head–tail (HT), coupling.
*2,2', or head–head (HH), coupling
*5,5', or tail–tail (TT), coupling
These three diads can be combined into four distinct triads, shown in Figure 3. [[Image:Polythiophenes Triads.png|frame|'''Figure 3.'''The four possible triads resulting from coupling of 3-substituted thiophenes.]]The triads are distinguishable by [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]], and the degree of regioregularity can be estimated by integration.&lt;ref name="barbarella_etal_1994"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ma00089a022|title=Regiochemistry and Conformation of Poly(3-hexylthiophene) via the Synthesis and the Spectroscopic Characterization of the Model Configurational Triads|year=1994|last1=Barbarella|first1=Giovanna|last2=Bongini|first2=Alessandro|last3=Zambianchi|first3=Massimo|journal=Macromolecules|volume=27|pages=3039|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Regiochemical Analysis of Water Soluble Conductive Polymers:  Sodium Poly(ω-(3-thienyl)alkanesulfonates)|journal=Macromolecules|year=1996|volume=29|page=5416|author=Diaz-Quijada, G.

Regioregularity affects the properties of PTs. A regiorandom copolymer of 3-methylthiophene and 3-butylthiophene possessed a conductivity of 50 S/cm, while a more regioregular copolymer with a 2:1 ratio of HT to HH couplings had a higher conductivity of 140 S/cm.&lt;ref&gt;Elsenbaumer, R.

===Solubility===
Unsubstituted PTs are conductive after doping, and have excellent environmental stability compared with some other conducting polymers such as [[polyacetylene]], but are intractable and soluble only in solutions like mixtures of [[arsenic]] trifluoride and arsenic pentafluoride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ar00121a001|title=Conducting polymer solutions|year=1986|last1=Frommer|first1=Jane E.|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|volume=19|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1987 examples of organic-soluble PTs were reported.

==Synthesis==
PTs can be synthesized electrochemically, by applying a potential across a solution of the monomer, or chemically, using [[Oxidizing agent|oxidants]] or [[Coupling reaction|cross-coupling]] catalysts. All methods have their advantages and disadvantages.

===Electrochemical synthesis===
In an electrochemical polymerization, a solution containing thiophene and an [[electrolyte]] produces a conductive PT film on the [[anode]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Electrochemical polymerization is convenient, since the polymer does not need to be isolated and purified, but it can produce polymers with undesirable alpha-beta linkages and varying degrees of regioregularity.

[[Image:Polythiophenes Electropolymerization.png|frame|'''Figure 4.''' Initial steps in the electropolymerization of thiophenes.]]

As shown in Figure 4, oxidation of a monomer produces a [[Radical ion|radical cation]], which can then couple with a second radical cation to form a dication dimer, or with another monomer to produce a radical cation dimer. Deposition of long, well-ordered chains onto the electrode surface is followed by growth of either long, flexible chains, or shorter, more crosslinked chains, depending upon the polymerization conditions.

The quality of an electrochemically prepared PT film is affected by a number of factors. These include the electrode material, current density, temperature, solvent, electrolyte, presence of water, and monomer concentration.&lt;ref name="schopf_and_kossmehl_1997" /&gt; Two other important but interrelated factors are the structure of the monomer and the applied potential. The potential required to oxidize the monomer depends upon the electron density in the thiophene ring π-system. Electron-donating groups lower the oxidation potential, while electron-withdrawing groups increase the oxidation potential. Thus, 3-methylthiophene polymerizes in acetonitrile and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate at a potential of about 1.5 V vs. SCE ([[saturated calomel electrode]]), while unsubstituted thiophene polymerizes at about 1.7 V vs. SCE. [[Steric effects|Steric hindrance]] resulting from branching at the α-carbon of a 3-substituted thiophene inhibits polymerization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/j100311a030|title=Effects of steric factors on the electrosynthesis and properties of conducting poly(3-alkylthiophenes)|year=1987|last1=Roncali|first1=J.|last2=Garreau|first2=R.|last3=Yassar|first3=A.|last4=Marque|first4=P.|last5=Garnier|first5=F.|last6=Lemaire|first6=M.|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume=91|pages=6706|issue=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This observation leads to the so-called "polythiophene paradox": the oxidation potential of many thiophene monomers is higher than the oxidation potential of the resulting polymer. In other words, the polymer can be irreversibly oxidized and decompose at a rate comparable to the polymerization of the corresponding monomer.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This remains one of the major disadvantages of electrochemical polymerization, and limits its application for many thiophene monomers with complex side groups.

===Chemical synthesis===
Chemical synthesis offers two advantages compared with electrochemical synthesis of PTs: a greater selection of monomers, and, using the proper catalysts, the ability to synthesize perfectly regioregular substituted PTs. While PTs may have been chemically synthesized by accident more than a century ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meyer |first=Victor |authorlink=Viktor Meyer |title=Ueber den Begleiter des Benzols im Steinkohlentheer |language=German |trans-title=On the companion of benzene in stone coal &lt;!-- better translation required --&gt; |journal=[[Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft]] |date=January–June 1883 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=1465–1478 |doi=10.1002/cber.188301601324}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first planned chemical syntheses using metal-catalyzed polymerization of 2,5-dibromothiophene were reported by two groups independently in 1980. Yamamoto ''et al.'' used [[magnesium]] in [[tetrahydrofuran]] (THF) and nickel(bipyridine) dichloride, analogous to the [[Kumada coupling]] of Grignard reagents to aryl halides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yamamoto |first1=Takakazu |first2=Kenichi |last2=Sanechika |first3=Akio |last3=Yamamoto |title=Preparation of thermostable and electric-conducting poly(2,5-thienylene) |journal=Journal of Polymer Science C |date=January 1980 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=9–12 |doi=10.1002/pol.1980.130180103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lin and Dudek also used magnesium in THF, but with a series of [[acetylacetone|acetylacetonate]] catalysts ([[palladium(II) acetylacetonate|Pd(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[nickel(II) acetylacetonate|Ni(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Metal acetylacetonates#Cobalt acetylacetonates|Co(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[Tris(acetylacetonato)iron(III)|Fe(acac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John W-P. |last1=Lin |first2=Lesley P. |last2=Dudek |title =Synthesis and properties of poly(2,5-thienylene) |journal=Journal of Polymer Science A|date=September 1980 |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=2869–2873 |doi=10.1002/pol.1980.170180910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later developments produced higher molecular weight PTs than those initial efforts, and can be grouped into two categories based on their structure. Regioregular PTs can be synthesized by catalytic cross-coupling reactions of bromothiophenes, while polymers with varying degrees of regioregularity can be simply synthesized by oxidative polymerization.

Regioregular PTs were described by McCullough ''et al.'' in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C39920000070|title=Enhanced electrical conductivity in regioselectively synthesized poly(3-alkylthiophenes)|year=1992|last1=McCullough|first1=Richard D.|last2=Lowe|first2=Renae D.|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications|pages=70|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown in Figure 5 (top), [[Image:Polythiophenes Crosscoupling.png|frame|'''Figure 5.''' Cross-coupling methods for preparing regioregular PATs.]] selective bromination produces 2-bromo-3-alkylthiophene, which is followed by lithiation, [[transmetalation]] and then [[Kumada coupling|Kumada cross-coupling]] in the presence of a nickel catalyst. This method produces approximately 100% HT–HT couplings, according to NMR spectroscopy analysis of the diads. In the method subsequently described by Rieke ''et al.'' in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ma00065a036|title=Use of highly reactive zinc leads to a new, facile synthesis for polyarylenes|year=1993|last1=Chen|first1=Tian An|last2=O'Brien|first2=Richard A.|last3=Rieke|first3=Reuben D.|journal=Macromolecules|volume=26|pages=3462|issue=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2,5-dibromo-3-alkylthiophene is treated with highly reactive "Rieke zinc"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jo00004a021|title=The direct formation of functionalized alkyl(aryl)zinc halides by oxidative addition of highly reactive zinc with organic halides and their reactions with acid chlorides, .alpha.,.beta.-unsaturated ketones, and allylic, aryl, and vinyl halides|year=1991|last1=Zhu|first1=Lishan|last2=Wehmeyer|first2=Richard M.|last3=Rieke|first3=Reuben D.|journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry|volume=56|pages=1445|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form a mixture of organometallic isomers (Figure 5, bottom). Addition of a catalytic amount of Pd(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; produces a regiorandom polymer, but treatment with Ni(dppe)Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yields regioregular PAT in quantitative yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja00051a066|title=The first regioregular head-to-tail poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) and a regiorandom isopolymer: nickel versus palladium catalysis of 2(5)-bromo-5(2)-(bromozincio)-3-hexylthiophene polymerization|year=1992|last1=Chen|first1=Tian An|last2=Rieke|first2=Reuben D.|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=114|pages=10087|issue=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the McCullough and Rieke methods produce structurally homogenous PATs, they require low temperatures, the careful exclusion of water and oxygen, and brominated monomers. In contrast, the oxidative polymerization of thiophenes using ferric chloride described by Sugimoto in 1986 can be performed at room temperature under less demanding conditions.&lt;ref name="sugimoto_etal_1986"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sugimoto |first1=R. |last2=Taketa |first2=S. |last3=Gu |first3=H.

A number of studies have been conducted in attempts to improve the yield and quality of the product obtained using the oxidative polymerization technique.

The mechanism of the oxidative polymerization using ferric chloride has been controversial. Sugimoto ''et al.'' did not speculate on a mechanism in their 1986 report.&lt;ref name="sugimoto_etal_1986" /&gt; In 1992, Niemi ''et al.'' proposed a radical mechanism, shown in Figure 6(top). [[Image:Polythiophenes FeCl3 mechanisms.png|frame|'''Figure 6.''' Proposed mechanisms for ferric chloride oxidative polymerizations of thiophenes.]] They based their mechanism on two assumptions. First, since they observed polymerization only in solvents where the catalyst was either partially or completely insoluble (chloroform, [[toluene]], carbon tetrachloride, [[pentane]], and [[hexane]], and not [[diethyl ether]], [[xylene]], acetone, or [[formic acid]]), they concluded that the active sites of the polymerization must be at the surface of solid ferric chloride. Therefore, they discounted the possibilities of either two radical cations reacting with each other, or two radicals reacting with each other, "because the chloride ions at the surface of the crystal would prevent the radical cations or radicals from assuming positions suitable for dimerization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Niemi |first1=V. M. |last2=Knuuttila |first2=P. |last3=Österholm |first3=J. E. |last4=Korvola |first4=J. |title=Polymerization of 3-alkylthiophenes with ferric chloride |journal=Polymer |volume=33 |pages=1559–1562 |doi=10.1016/0032-3861(92)90138-M |year=1992 |issue=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, using 3-methylthiophene as a prototypical monomer, they performed [[Computational chemistry|quantum mechanical calculations]] to determine the energies and the total atomic charges on the carbon atoms of the four possible polymerization species (neutral 3-methylthiophene, the radical cation, the radical on carbon 2, and the radical on carbon 5).

[[Image:Polythiophenes 3mt.PNG|100px|3-methylthiophene]]

Since the most negative carbon of the neutral 3-methylthiophene is also carbon 2, and the carbon with the highest odd electron population of the radical cation is carbon 2, they concluded that a radical cation mechanism would lead to mostly 2–2, H–H links.  They then calculated the total energies of the species with the radicals at the 2 and the 5 carbons, and found that the latter was more stable by 1.5 kJ/mol. Therefore, the more stable radical could react with the neutral species, forming head-to-tail couplings as shown in Figure 6 (top).

Andersson ''et al.'' offered an alternative mechanism in the course of their studies of the polymerization of 3-(4-octylphenyl)thiophene with ferric chloride, where they found a high degree of regioregularity when the catalyst was added to the monomer mixture slowly. They concluded that, given the selectivity of the couplings, and the strong oxidizing conditions, the reaction could proceed via a carbocation mechanism (Figure 6, middle).&lt;ref name="andersson_etal_1994" /&gt;

The radical mechanism was directly challenged in a short communication in 1995, when Olinga and François noted that thiophene could be polymerized by ferric chloride in acetonitrile, a solvent in which the catalyst is completely soluble. Their analysis of the kinetics of thiophene polymerization also seemed to contradict the predictions of the [[radical polymerization]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0379-6779(94)02457-A|title=Kinetics of polymerization of thiophene by FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in choloroform and acetonitrile|year=1995|last1=Olinga|first1=T.|journal=Synthetic Metals|volume=69|pages=297|last2=François|first2=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbarella ''et al.'' studied the oligomerization of 3-(alkylsulfanyl)thiophenes, and concluded from their quantum mechanical calculations, and considerations of the enhanced stability of the radical cation when delocalized over a planar conjugated oligomer, that a radical cation mechanism analogous to that generally accepted for electrochemical polymerization was more likely (Figure 6, bottom).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jo960982j|title=Regioselective Oligomerization of 3-(Alkylsulfanyl)thiophenes with Ferric Chloride|pmid=11667817|year=1996|last1=Barbarella|first1=Giovanna|last2=Zambianchi|first2=Massimo|last3=Di Toro|first3=Rosanna|last4=Colonna|first4=Martino|last5=Iarossi|first5=Dario|last6=Goldoni|first6=Francesca|last7=Bongini|first7=Alessandro|journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry|volume=61|issue=23|pages=8285–8292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the difficulties of studying a system with a heterogeneous, strongly oxidizing catalyst that produces difficult to characterize rigid-rod polymers, the mechanism of oxidative polymerization is by no means decided. However, the radical cation mechanism shown in Figure 6 is generally accepted as the most likely route for PT synthesis.

==Applications==
[[File:Polythiophenes Pedotpss.png|thumb|left|'''Figure 7.''' PEDOT-PSS ([[Clevios]] P).]]As an example of a static application, [[PEDOT|poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS)]] product ("Clevios P", see figure) from [[Heraeus]] has been extensively used as an antistatic coating (as packaging materials for electronic components, for example). [[Agfa-Gevaert|AGFA]] coats 200 m × 10 m of [[photographic film]] per year with PEDOT:PSS because of its [[antistatic]] properties. The thin layer of PEDOT:PSS is virtually transparent and colorless, prevents electrostatic discharges during film rewinding, and reduces dust buildup on the negatives after processing.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

PEDOT also have been proposed for dynamic applications where a potential is applied to a polymer film. PEDOT-coated windows and mirrors become opaque or reflective upon the application of an electric potential, a manifestation of its [[electrochromism|electrochromic properties]].&lt;ref name="heuer_etal_2002" /&gt; Widespread adoption of [[electrochromic]] windows promise significant savings in [[air conditioning]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosseinsky|first1=D.

A number of applications have been proposed for conducting PTs, but have not achieved commercialization. Potential applications include [[field-effect transistors]],&lt;ref&gt;Garnier, F. "Field-Effect Transistors Based on Conjugated Materials".

Static applications rely upon the intrinsic [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] of the materials, combined with their ease of processing and material properties common to polymeric materials. Dynamic applications utilize changes in the conductive and optical properties, resulting either from application of electric potentials or from environmental stimuli.

PTs have been touted as sensor elements. In addition to [[sensor|biosensor applications]], PTs can also be functionalized with receptors for detecting metal ions or [[optical isomer|chiral molecules]] as well. PTs with pendant [[crown ether]] functionalities exhibit properties that vary with the alkali metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adma.19930051113|title=Molecular recognition of alkali-ions by crown-ether-functionalized poly(alkylthiophenes)|year=1993|last1=Bäuerle|first1=Peter|last2=Scheib|first2=Stefan|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=5|pages=848|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and main-chain&lt;ref name="marsella_and_swager_1993" /&gt;(Figure 8).

The ritual is administered by a body called [[Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer#Corporation of the Seven Wardens|The Corporation of the Seven Wardens]].&lt;ref name="ritual"&gt;"[http://www.ironring.ca The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer ]", ''[[#The Corporation of the Seven Wardens|The Corporation of the Seven Wardens]]'', Retrieved 4 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the ritual each participant is conferred the [[Iron Ring]].

==History==
The ritual traces its origins to professor [[H. E. T. Haultain]] of the [[University of Toronto]], who believed and persuaded other members of the [[Engineering Institute of Canada]] that there needed to be a ceremony and standard of ethics developed for graduating engineers. The ritual was created in 1922 by [[Rudyard Kipling]] at the request of Haultain, representing seven past-presidents of the [[Engineering Institute of Canada]].&lt;ref name="hist_finger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iron_ring"&gt;"[http://www.eir.ca/engineers/ironring.php?link=4 Engineer-in-Residence/ Iron Ring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706175651/http://www.eir.ca/engineers/ironring.php?link=4 |date=6 July 2011 }}", ''[[Professional Engineers Ontario]]'', Retrieved 4 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The seven past-presidents were the original seven Wardens of the Corporation.

An inaugural ceremony was held in the evening of 25 April 1925, at the University Club of Montreal, when the obligation was taken by six engineers,&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Ross, Consulting Engineer, acting as the Senior Supervising Engineer of the ceremony; J.M.R. Fairbairn, Chief Engineer, Canadian Pacific Railway; Harold Rolph, President, John S. Metcalf and Co., Consulting Engineers; N.M. Lash, Chief Engineer, Bell Telephone Co.; J.M. Robertson, Consulting Engineer; and John Chalmers, Engineer for John Quinlan &amp; Co., Contractors.&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom were involved with Kipling in its development. On 1 May 1925, three of these newly obligated engineers&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ross, Dr. Fairbairn and Mr. Rolph.&lt;/ref&gt; met at the University of Toronto with a number of the officers of the Engineering Alumni Association and obligated 14 of them in the Senate Chamber of the university becoming the first local chapter (referred to as a camp) to do so. Fairbairn met with Harry F. McLean, president of Dominion Construction and Kipling in Montreal at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel to discuss the details of the ritual. Fairbairn later visited McLean at his home in Merrickville, Ontario, to secure a sizeable donation from McLean, philanthropist, on behalf of the Corporation of the Seven Wardens, the custodian and administrator of the ritual, to ensure its survival. The Ritual and the conferring of the Iron Ring continues to be administered by The Corporation of the Seven Wardens Inc./''Société des Sept Gardiens inc.'' through camps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ironring.ca/contact.php|title=Camp Contacts - The Iron Ring|website=www.IronRing.ca|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with the universities granting degrees in engineering in Canada.

==Ritual==
The ritual takes place separately at individual Camps across Canada usually situated near an engineering university. The ceremonies are separate, organised by one of 26 camps of the Corporation of the Seven Wardens for administrative purposes.

[[File:Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer Oath.jpg|thumb|right|The obligation spoken by Canadian Engineers at the Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]]
The [[moral obligation|Obligation]], which is not an [[oath]] but a solemn expression of intention, is subscribed to at the [[ceremony]]. The Obligation essentially states the duties and responsibilities of the engineer. Following the Obligation, the [[Iron Ring]] is placed on the [[little finger]] of the working hand,&lt;ref name="hist_finger"&gt;"[http://www.order-of-the-engineer.org/?page_id=15 Order Of The Engineer-History ]", ''[[Order of the Engineer]].org'', Retrieved 4 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and is worn by the engineer as a [[symbol]] and a reminder. As originally conceived, the engineer's iron ring rubs against the drawings and paper upon which the Engineer writes and even in modern times, serves as a reminder when working on a computer.

The Obligation is [[privacy|private]], though not necessarily [[secrecy|secret]].&lt;ref name="ringceremony"/&gt; However, it is customary for those who have gone through it to not discuss the details of the Calling with others, even engineers from other countries. The ceremony is open only to candidates or those who have already undergone the ritual.&lt;ref name="ringceremony"&gt;Compiled by Dr. J. Jeswiet, "[http://www.networx.on.ca/~njdevil/mainpage/E_Eng/Academic/jj-ring.htm#4 Information Relevant to the Iron Ring Ceremony ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192330/http://www.networx.on.ca/~njdevil/mainpage/E_Eng/Academic/jj-ring.htm |date=6 July 2011 }}", 22 November 2001; Retrieved 4 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the preparation for the ritual, candidates are instructed not to discuss the details of the ritual with the media. A reminder of this is provided at the end of the ceremony in the form of a written instruction that states: "''The Rule of Governance provides that there shall be no publicity in connection with the Ritual." ''&lt;ref name="ringceremony"/&gt;

Commemorating the 75th anniversary, the Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer domestic-rate stamp was issued on 25 April 2000. Designer Darrell Freeman's "head-to-foot" layout incorporates the symbolic iron ring that is presented as part of the ceremony. The ring also visually links the four engineering achievements featured on this stamp.&lt;ref name="comm_stamp"&gt;"[http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/personal/collecting/stamps/archives/2000/2000_apr_ritual.jsf Commemorative Stamp-Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer, 1925–2000 ]", ''[[Canada Post]]'', 25 April 2000; Retrieved 4 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer has a very simple purpose: To direct the newly qualified engineer toward a consciousness of the profession and its social significance and indicating to the more experienced engineer their responsibilities in welcoming and supporting the newer engineers when they are ready to enter the profession.&lt;ref name="camp1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.camp1.ca/wordpress/?page_id=2|title=The Wardens of Camp One -   The Calling of an Engineer|website=www.Camp1.ca|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ring symbolizes the pride which engineers have in their profession, while simultaneously reminding them of their humility. The ring serves as a reminder to the engineer and others of the engineer’s obligation to live by a high standard of professional conduct.&lt;ref name="camp1"/&gt;

==Iron Ring==
{{main|Iron Ring}}
[[File:Ironring2005.JPG|thumb|200px|Iron Ring, iron version, circa 2005]]
The Iron Ring may be made from either iron or [[stainless steel]]. Presently, only Camp One of the Corporation in [[Toronto]] continues to confer rings made from iron; stainless steel rings are conferred at all other locations across Canada. The Iron Ring does not certify a person as a [[Professional Engineer]],&lt;ref name="ritual"/&gt; which requires registration with a relevant professional organisation followed by examination and practical experience.

==Corporation of the Seven Wardens==
The Corporation of the Seven Wardens (French: ''Société des Sept Gardiens'') is the body that holds the rights and the duty to carry out The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer. It is organised into 26 regional branches, called ''camps'', numbered by order of establishment. The term ''camp'' is used to describe these regional branches because it conveys a smaller, close-knit sense of community.

'''Tangential firing''' is a method of firing a fuel to heat air in [[thermal power station]]s. The flame envelope rotates ensuring thorough mixing within the furnace, providing complete [[combustion]] and uniform heat distribution.

==Overview==
The most effective method for producing intense [[turbulence]] is by the impingement of one flame on another. This action is secured through the use of [[Coal burner|burners]] located in each of the four corners of the [[furnace]], close to the floor or the water-screen. The burner [[nozzles]] are so directed that the streams of [[coal]] and air are projected along a line [[tangent]] to a small circle, lying in a [[horizontal plane]], at the center of the furnace. Intensive mixing occurs where these streams meet. A [[Scrubber|scrubbing]] action is present which assures contact between the [[combustible]] and [[oxygen]], thus promoting rapid [[combustion]] and reducing [[carbon]] loss. A rotative motion, similar to that of a [[cyclone]], is imparted to the flame body, which spreads out and fills the furnace area. The [[Combustion|ignition]] at each burner is aided by the flame from the preceding one.

==Advantages==
With tangential firing the furnace is essentially the burner, consequently air and coal quantities need not be accurately proportional to the individual fuel nozzle assemblies. Turbulence produced in the furnace cavity is sufficient to combine all the fuel and air. This continuously ensures uniform and complete combustion so that test performance can be maintained throughout daily operation. With other types of firing the fuel and air must be accurately proportioned to individual burners making it difficult to always equal test results.

With this type of firing, combustion is extremely rapid, and short flame length results. The mixing is so intense that combustion rates exceeding 35,000 Btu/(ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·h) or 360&amp;nbsp;kW/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are practical under certain conditions. However, since there is considerable impingement of flame over the furnace walls it is absolutely necessary that they be fully water-cooled. This sweeping of the water-cooled surfaces, in the furnace, by the gas increases the [[evaporation]] rate. Thus, in addition to absorption by [[radiation]] from the flame envelope, there is transfer by [[convection]], and the resulting furnace temperatures are lower than with other types of burners, even though the heat liberation rates may be somewhat higher. Tangentially fired furnaces are usually clean in the upper zone and, as a result, both the furnace and the [[boiler]] are comparatively free from objectionable [[slag]] deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzi, M.E., Otto, ed. ''Combustion Engineering''. 1st ed. New York: Comustion Engineering, INC., 1955. 8.16-8.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Technology of ''The Saga of Seven Suns''}}
The '''technology of ''The Saga of Seven Suns''''' is a key aspect of the fictional setting of ''[[The Saga of Seven Suns]]'' series of [[science fiction]] novels written by [[Kevin J. Anderson]]. In this series, humans have colonized multiple planets in the galaxy, which is also home to various alien races: the [[Ildirans]], [[Klikiss]], [[faeros]], [[hydrogues]], [[verdani]] and [[wentals]].

== Earth Defense Force/Hansa ==

===Artificial intelligence===
* '''Compies''' – "Competent Computerized Companions" come in a variety of makes and models (Teacher, Friendly, Governess etc.), and are referred to by the first two letters of their serial numbers. such as DD, EA, UR, OX etc.
* '''Soldier compies''' – Using Klikiss robot technology, gained when William Andeker was given permission by the robots to study them, and the robot ''Jorax'' sacrificed himself for this cause, the soldier compies were then designed using this new knowledge. They contained core Klikiss robot programming which ''Sirix'' and the other robots were later able to activate, effectively taking control of the Soldier Compies so as to be used for their own means and agendas.

===Energy source===

Ekti is a fictional allotrope of hydrogen which is used to power the Ildiran stardrive, the only feasible method of interstellar travel at the start of the series. Earth ships have modified and improved drives attached.

Ekti is harvested from gas giants as their atmosphere is mostly Hydrogen. Hydrogen being the most abundant element in the universe can also be found in interstellar nebulae as well as planets close to and farthest away from the Sun. To extract the Hydrogen which in turn is converted to Ekti large Skymines are used. These plants are usually manned by Roamers, nomadic breakaway Earthers, but occasionally by Ildirans and the Hansa. In extracting Hydrogen from nebula large Nebular Skimmers slowly collect the Hydrogen for transport to be converted into Ekti, where it is shipped off. Harvesting of it is limited after gas giant aliens start destroying extractors.

===Ship-based weapons===
* '''Jazer''' – A powerful [[Laser]] type energy weapon, "Jacketed" in a [[magnetic field]] sheath. It fires bolts of high-energy particles. Can cause significant damage to other vessels or to the ground from orbit.
* '''Railgun''' – An extremely powerful electromagnetic field based weapon. It fires solid kinetic projectiles made of superdense depleted uranium. Can cause damage of a small nuclear warhead.
* '''Fracture pulse drone''' – Self-propelled drone missiles which emit a devastating high-frequency "fracture pulse", capable of swiftly shattering solid matter.
* '''Carbon–carbon smashers''' – Designed specifically for the war against the hydrogues. they were designed to break the complex [[carbon-carbon bond]]s of the diamond hulled hydrogue warglobes.

===Personal weapons===
* '''Personal jazer''' – A smaller version of the jazer with a less significant energy output; it is still, however, a very effective weapon that must be mounted on the shoulder.
* '''Twitcher''' – A small hand held non-fatal, but effective weapon. It causes spasming (hence the name) and loss of muscle control making a person limp and therefore no longer a threat.
* '''Cutter''' – A small hand-held laser.

== Ildiran ==

===Ship-based weapons===
* '''Kinetic missile launchers''' – are used by Ildiran Empire. The descriptions in the story are vague, but imply some kind of RKV (relativistic kill vehicle), in other words exactly what the name implies—a missile that uses its own kinetic energy and mass as a weapon. At a certain speed or size (or both) no warhead would be required.
* '''High energy cutting beams''' – Are Used by Ildiran Empire. Again the description is vague, but the name implies it is a kind of particle beam weapon. In that respect it would be not that different from the Jazer.
* '''Planet-splitters''' – These extremely powerful weapons rival even the strongest of the Hansa weapons, capable of destroying a small ship in two shots.
* '''Lasers''' – Outdated weapons of concentrated light that were historically used against the Shana Rei.
* '''Sun Bombs''' – These large bombs detonate with the power of a concentrated supernova. While a mainly historical and discarded weapon they are the most powerful defence against darkness and even rival the Faeros for power.

===Personal weapons===
* '''Crystal katana''' – Ildirans are known for their strength and hand to hand combat skills. The katana is the most traditional weapon of the Ildirans.
* '''Jousting laser''' – Laser Jousting is a popular Ildiran sport. It involves mirror-armoured Ildirans riding Ildiran native creatures in an arena, fighting with laser based weapons, and defending themselves with a mirrored shield. The Jousting Laser itself is a weak basic laser weapon, designed for sport, not battle, but it has been used in such a manner and can be quite effective.

===Transportation===
* '''Stardrive''' – The Stardrive is an Ildiran technology, given to Mankind on discovery of the [[Generation ship]] the Caillie in 2244. They promptly visit Earth and search for the remaining 10 [[Generation ship]]s. It works on the principal of high speed [[Faster-than-light|Faster Than Light Travel]] however the star drive propels a ship at only a small fraction greater of that speed. The drive uses [[ekti]] (a fictional allotrope of Hydrogen) as a fuel and creates a barrier around the ship, a time distortion is created within this barrier. The time within the ship is much slower than the time outside the barrier in normal space. This allows for a shorter awareness of the journey. During its creation the time barrier was found by accident, the scientist first discovered the time distortion in initial tests without having intended for it to happen.

== Klikiss ==

===Artificial Intelligence===
* '''Klikiss robots''' – Klikiss robots were built and designed by the original [[Klikiss]] before their disappearance ten thousand years ago; they were reactivated in approximately the 1940s [[Common Era|C.E.]] by the Ildirans. The robots themselves are very intricate in terms of design, with largely unknown inner workings. Though they all look identical, they each consider themselves unique in some respect, as they assign names to each member of their race. They have blunt speech mannerisms, and often do not reveal too much about themselves or their motives. Although they do not expose them very often, the Klikiss robots are equipped with a variety of built-in weapons systems and advanced wings that allow them to fly. It is worth noting that their infrastructures are practically indestructible, with nothing seemingly able to deal them damage; three robots were hit by a monsoon and came back with only superficial damage, and later a large number of them could exist at the core of a gas giant with no trouble whatsoever. However Ildiran, Human and Klikiss weaponry has proved somewhat effective in destroying or at least damaging the robots, and the Klikiss, with knowledge of the robots construction are able to dismantle the robots with relative ease on the battlefield. The Klikiss robots were programmed specifically to fear and cower beneath the Klikiss themselves. As the klikiss race was built on war, they needed new recipients of their wrath after all renegade hives had been defeated and consumed into a single enormous hive. (The robots can be seen on the UK edition cover of ''[[Scattered Suns]]''.)
* '''Ship-based weapons''' – Unnamed weapons have been noted in the series. Laser type weapons and projectile weapons are mentioned, also a strong and powerful energy beam has been mentioned to be created when Swarm Ships gather together in a cylindrical shape and charge then displace energy of high volumes able to destroy an entire EDF Manta in one shot.

===Personal weapons===
* '''Bell mouth''' – This appears to be some sort of large hand held energy weapon that fires a bolt of what is described as [[Plasma (physics)|'plasma'.]]
* '''Web gun''' – This appears to be a small tubular weapon that fires a liquid resin that solidifies into a restraining web.

===Transportation===
* '''TransPortals''' – These large [[trapezoidal]] artifacts, discovered on [[Llaro]] were originally built thousands of years ago by the Klikiss, and through unknown [[physics]] are able to transport matter instantaneously to one of an unknown number of Transportals throughout the Spiral Arm, and perhaps the entire Milky Way. In 2427, Louis Colicos was able to activate the Transportal on [[Rheindic Co]].

===Ships===
* '''SwarmShip''' – Individual Klikiss ships connect to form a swarmship. The swarmship also rearranges to form a cannon, which shoots blue-white energy capable of destroying an EDF Manta in one shot.

== Hydrogues ==

===Weapons===

On the exterior of the Hydrogue War Globe are triangular pyramids that fire an electricity based "lightning" weapon, and also a cold based weapon capable of freezing large areas.

===Transportation===
* '''Transgates''' – Transgates are large versions of Transportals, built in the centres of gas giants by the [[hydrogues]] as a way to transport between their home worlds without revealing their existence.
* '''Space propulsion''' Though rarely done as to conceal their existence. Hydrogue ships can propel themselves with no engine or ekti.

== Wentals ==

===Weapons===

Wentals use themselves as weapons. The liquids they control appear to be highly corrosive to the surface of hydrogue warglobes. They may also be shaped into point shaped cylindar projectiles to be fired out of Human and Ildiran gunports or combined with the Verdani in a spherical shape to engulf faeros.

== Faeros ==

===Weapons===

[[faeros]] are giant fireballs, and simply ram into their enemies or surround them and melt them.
* '''Transgates''' – Transgates are large versions of Transportals, built in the centres of Suns by the [[faeros]] as a way to travel between their home worlds without revealing their existence.

== Verdani ==

===Weapons===

The [[verdani]] have been described as using seed pods, which are capable of cutting through the thick diamond hulled ships of the hydrogues. They also have big ships described as seed ships, that need a green priest to join with them. The trees themselves can use vines to destroy warglobes. They may also join with the wentals, forming a spherical shape with a verdani frond inside that is able to engulf faeros.

'''''The Dream Master''''' (1966), originally published as a novella titled '''''He Who Shapes''''', is a science fiction novel by American writer [[Roger Zelazny]]. Zelazny's originally intended title for it was '''''The Ides of Octember'''''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120401212238/http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/triffid/trimmings/volume2/08_The_Lesser_Spotted_Roger_Zelazny.htm The Lesser Spotted Science Fiction Writer - Part 7: Roger Zelazny]&lt;/ref&gt; The novella won a [[Nebula Award]] in 1966.

==Plot summary==
''The Dream Master'' is set in a future where the forces of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and technology have created a world where humanity suffocates psychologically beneath its own mass while abiding in relative physical comfort. This is a world ripe for [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] innovations, such as the "neuroparticipant therapy" in which the protagonist, Charles Render, specializes. In neuroparticipation, the patient is hooked into a gigantic simulation controlled directly by the analyst's mind; the analyst then works with the patient to construct dreams—nightmares, wish-fulfillment, etc.--that afford insight into the underlying neuroses of the patient, and in some cases the possibility of direct intervention. (For example, a man submerging himself in a fantasy world sees it utterly destroyed at Render's hands, and is thus "cured" of his obsession with it.)

Render, the leader in his field, takes on a patient with an unusual problem. Eileen Shallot aspires to become a neuroparticipant therapist herself, but is somewhat hampered by congenital blindness. Not having experienced visual sensation in the same way as her patients, she would be unable to convincingly construct visual dreams for them; indeed, in a case of eye-envy, her own neurotic desire to see through the eyes of her patients might prevent her from treating them effectively. However, she explains to Render, if a practicing neuroparticipant therapist is willing to work with her, he can expose her to the full range of visual stimuli in a controlled environment, free of her own attachments to the issue, and enable her to pursue her career.

Despite his better sense and the advice of colleagues, Render agrees to go along with the treatment. But as they progress, Eileen's hunger for visual stimulation continues to grow, and she begins to assert her will against Render's, subsuming him into her own dreams.

==Other media==
In 1981 Zelazny wrote a film outline based on ''The Dream Master'' that 20th Century Fox purchased and later developed into the film ''[[Dreamscape (1984 film)|Dreamscape]]''. Because he wrote the outline but neither the treatment or script, his name did not appear in the credits. Assertions that he had his name removed from the credits are unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;"...And Call Me Roger": The Literary Life of Roger Zelazny, Part 4, by Christopher S. Kovacs.

==History==
&lt;br&gt;For the first half-century of its existence, the United Nations felt protected by its flag and the reality that it was a neutral, benevolent actor in world events. If United Nations personnel were directly targeted, it was generally viewed as an isolated event. In the early 1990s, the security environment for the United Nations changed and became more threatening. There was a rise in the number of deaths and injuries to personnel as a result of malicious acts. The mandate of the United Nations also evolved, resulting in a larger number of United Nations personnel, notably from the humanitarian agencies, being deployed on potentially hazardous missions.
At the same time, peacekeeping missions were being established in areas at war or in situations of high risk. Increasingly, humanitarian personnel were being deployed alongside peacekeeping military units in integrated multidisciplinary missions.

'''An evolving security management system :''' The UN’s security management system was designed for the operational requirements which existed in the UN’s early days. By the 1990s, the system was no longer able to fulfill its responsibilities adequately, despite the best efforts and dedication of all those involved. To allow the United Nations to meet new demands in a changing environment, the General Assembly authorized an increase in the staff of the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator (UNSECOORD), primarily in the field. In 2001, the General Assembly authorized the creation of a full-time United Nations Security Coordinator at the level of Assistant Secretary-General. By 2002, the number of professional security officer posts in the field numbered 100 Professional and 200 locally-recruited posts.

The United Nations Security Coordinator oversaw the activities of the UN field security management system and was a senior official appointed by the Secretary-General. The Office was responsible for all policy and procedural matters related to security; ensuring a coherent response by the United Nations to any emergency situation; coordinating, planning and implementing inter-agency security programmes and acting as the focal point for inter-agency cooperation concerning all security matters and, on behalf of the Secretary-General, taking all decisions related to the relocation/evacuation of personnel and their eligible dependents from very insecure areas.
In addition to UNSECOORD, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) had in place its own separate security structure for civilian personnel in UN peacekeeping operations. Political missions of the Department of Political Affairs that were administratively backstopped by DPKO remained under the UN field security management system.&lt;br&gt;Each of the major UN locations around the world had their own Security and Safety Services which operated independently from the UN security management system and from any central direction.
The Security and Safety Service (SSS) was first established at UN Headquarters in 1948. For decades, SSS in New York and at seven other Secretariat headquarters locations around the world (Geneva, Vienna, Nairobi, Bangkok, Beirut, Addis Ababa and Santiago), operated independently of each other and had no common governance structure. Their role was to provide security and safety for headquarters personnel, premises and operations at those locations, as well to protect delegates and visitors to the premises and provide personal security details for senior United Nations officials and visiting dignitaries.
Between 2002 and 2003, efforts were made by the United Nations Security Coordinator to professionalize the Organization’s security for its personnel through improved recruitment and training, and to institutionalize security coordination among United Nations agencies, Funds, and Programmes through the establishment of an Inter-Agency Security Management Network (IASMN). However, security structures in PKOs and SPMs, as well as  in SSS locationscontinued to function as separate entities to the structure in place for the field.&lt;br&gt;In early August 2003, independent security experts carried out an analysis of the UN security management system and concluded that the development and implementation of an overall security governance and accountability framework, including Headquarters, humanitarian and development personnel and civilian personnel in peacekeeping missions would lead to a strengthened and unified security management system.

'''The Ahtisaari panel :''' Despite the growing security concerns and the efforts to address them the UN Headquarters at the Canal Hotel in Baghdad was attacked on 19 August 2003, which came as a devastating shock. The attack, carried out by a suicide bomber driving a truck filled with explosives, killed 22 United Nations personnel and visitors, including SRSGT De Mello,and injured more than 150 people.
The attack was the first significant and targeted attack against the United Nations calling to attention the limited coordination and cohesion of security provisions for UN staff and permises globally.  The attacks led to an urgent second review of the security system by the Independent Panel on the Safety and Security of United Nations Personnel, known as the Ahtisaari panel.
 “''The United Nations could, in theory, be the target of attacks anywhere at any time, from Baghdad to Kabul, Nairobi, Jakarta, Geneva or New York. There are no indications that the perpetrators of the attacks in Baghdad would refrain from attacking other UN targets worldwide.''” – Ahtisaari Panel report.
The Ahtisaari panel called for a new, drastically revised security strategy for the United Nations. The panel recommended that the core elements of the new strategy include clear articulation of the responsibilities of the United Nations to ensure the security of its personnel; the establishment of professional assessment tools for the analysis of threat and risks for United Nations operations worldwide; a robust security management system with adequate disciplinary measures to counter non-compliance; accountability at all managerial levels for the implementation of security regulations; and significant increases in resources to develop and maintain the necessary security infrastructure.

'''UNDSS is born'''
A concerted effort was subsequently made across the United Nations system to overhaul and improve staff security arrangements. In 2004, a radical proposal for strengthening and unifying the United Nations security management system was presented to the 59th session of the General Assembly in Report A/59/365 of 11 October 2004.
This resulted in the adoption of General Assembly Resolution (A/RES/59/276 December 2004) that created the Department of Safety and Security which merged the security management component of the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator (UNSECOORD) and  the Security and Safety Services (SSS) at Headquarters and at Offices away from Headquarters, (including the regional commissions),.
Furthermore, the Resolution mandated that the new Department be headed by a senior UN official at the rank of Under-Secretary-General for a non-renewable term of five years. The General Assembly also adopted measures to reinforce security operations in all locations and decided to establish a unified capacity for policy, standards, coordination, communications, compliance and threat and risk assessment.
The United Nations Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) was formally established on 1 January 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2039">'''VHSIC''' ('''Very High Speed Integrated Circuit''') was a 1980s [[United States|U.S.]] government program. The program's mission was to research and develop very high speed integrated circuits.

The [[United States Department of Defense]] launched the VHSIC program in 1980 as a joint tri-service (Army/Navy/Air Force) program.  The program led to advances in [[integrated circuit]] materials, lithography, packaging, testing, and algorithms, and created numerous [[computer-aided design]] tools.  A well-known part of the program's contribution is [[VHDL]], a hardware description language.  The program also redirected the military's interest in [[GaAs]] ICs back toward the commercial mainstream of [[CMOS]] circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Advanced Signal Processing | author = David J.

==Background==
{{main|Bacs}}
In 1968, the Joint Stock Banks Clearing Committee chaired by Dennis Gladwell, set-up the Inter-Bank Computer Bureau to modernise the existing paper-based [[standing order (banking)|standing order]] system. Secure electronic funds transfer between banks was introduced from later that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|page=10|edition=Vol 3|title=Ninth Report of Session 2010–11|publisher=[[House of Commons Treasury Committee]]|date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; significantly reducing both the processing time and human error associated with paper-based transactions, particularly bulk payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bacs Ltd and Charteris in new initiative to help major Bacs users |url=http://www.charteris.com/news/2004/bacs-ltd-and-charteris-in-new-initiative-to-help-major-bacs-users |publisher=Charteris plc |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 the company adopted the name "Bankers Automated Clearing Services Limited", soon shortened to [[Bacs]], which was formally adopted as the company's name in 1985.&lt;ref name=BACSCpHst&gt;{{cite web|title=Bacs Corporate History|url=https://www.bacs.co.uk/About/pages/corporateoverview.aspx|publisher=Bacs|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cruickshank Report===
In November 1998 [[HM Treasury]] commissioned a review of competition within the UK banking sector, to be chaired by [[Donald Cruickshank|Sir Don Cruickshank]]. Reporting in March 2000, [https://www.vocalink.com/media/1603/cruickshank_report_2000.pdf The Cruickshank Report] of competition within the UK banking sector recommended that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/eb025071|title=The Cruickshank report on competition in UK banking: Assessment and implications|date=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Clearance scheme ownership and management should be split from infrastructure operation and delivery 
*Infrastructure management should be conducted on a commercial basis with fair and open access to third parties
*A need for a low-cost way to transfer money quickly&lt;ref name="The Cruickshank report"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cruickshank report: Competition in the banking industry under scrutiny|url=http://competition.practicallaw.com/7-101-1508|publisher=Practical Law Company|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, on 1 December 2003, Bacs Payment Schemes Ltd (BPSL) was split from Bacs Limited. BPSL was established as a [[not for profit]] company with members from the banking industry, the purpose of which is to promote the use of automated payment schemes and govern the rules of the Bacs scheme. Bacs Limited owns the infrastructure to run the Bacs scheme. Bacs Limited was permitted to continue to use the Bacs name for one year, becoming Voca Limited on 12 October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bacs|url=https://www.bacs.co.uk/NewsCentre/Pages/FAQs.aspx|publisher=Bacs|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LINK Interchange Network Ltd===
{{main|LINK (UK)}}
[[LINK (UK)|LINK Interchange Network Ltd]] was formed in 1985 to create interoperability between [[Automated Teller Machine|ATMs]] across the United Kingdom. It became an international network in the 1990s through connection with the [[MasterCard]] and [[Visa Inc|Visa]] networks. In October 2002 LINK launched the first service that used ATMs as a retail channel, enabling the facility to top-up a mobile phone at an ATM, bringing banking and mobile phones together for the consumer.&lt;ref name="Top Up and Go"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Up and Go|url=http://www.topupandgo.com/why-choose-atms.aspx|publisher=Top Up and Go|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faster Payments Service==
In 2005 a joint proposal from Voca and LINK was selected to deliver the payment-processing infrastructure for the [[Faster Payments Service]], a near real-time interbank transfer for internet and telephone banking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peachey|first=Kevin|title=How fast is faster payment plan?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7411338.stm|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=news.bbc.co.uk/|date=22 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After forming a strong working partnership, which brought Voca's bulk processing together with LINK's real-time payment switching, the companies agreed to merge on 2 July 2007 to form '''VocaLink'''. Since its launch in 2008, over 3 billion real-time faster payment transactions have been processed by VocaLink.&lt;ref name="Voca LINK merger"&gt;{{cite web|title=OFT approves Voca-Link merger|url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/it-business/2893/oft-approves-voca-link-merger/|publisher=www.computerworlduk.com|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK payments infrastructure==
VocaLink operates its services out of two [[data centers]] based in the UK; based in [[Harrogate]]&lt;ref name="VocaLink Harrogate Data Centre"&gt;{{cite web|title=Retail Banking Supplement: Upwardly mobile|url=http://www.fstech.co.uk/fst/N-D09feature_RetailBankingSupp_MobileBanking.php|publisher=FSTech|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dunstable]].

===Bacs===
Bacs provides two payment products to consumers:
* Bacs Direct Credits, payer-initiated interbank transfers. VocaLink processes 2 billion of these payments every year, including over 90% of all UK salaries and 98% of state benefits.
* Direct Debits, transfers initiated by authorised payees. Three-quarters of UK adults have at least one direct debit commitment; the average person has at least six.&lt;ref name="Importance of Direct Debit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Late payments debt high enough to put UK SMEs out of business|url=http://www.sourcewire.com/news/74306/late-payments-debt-high-enough-to-put-uk-smes-out|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=www.sourcewire.com|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
VocaLink provides the underlying BacsTEL-IP infrastructure for Bacs,&lt;ref name="Voca flicks the SOA switch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voca flicks the SOA switch - Voca has overhauled its IT architecture in preparation for pan-European payments.|url=http://www.information-age.com/technology/applications-and-development/273486/voca-flicks-the-soa-switch|publisher=www.information-age.com|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which processes over 5.6 billion of clearing and settlement of automated payments a year,&lt;ref name="VocaLink Key Partnership for Payments"&gt;{{cite web|title=VocaLink|url=https://www.paymentsuk.org.uk/news-events/events/vocalink|publisher=The Payments Council|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a value of £4.2 trillion.

===LINK===
VocaLink provides the switching infrastructure behind LINK, the busiest ATM switching system in the world which switches over 3.5 billion card-initiated transactions from 130 million enabled cards annually.&lt;ref name="Das LINK"&gt;{{cite web|title=LINK - the UK ATM network|url=http://www.link.co.uk/about-link/|accessdate=16 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430060357/http://www.link.co.uk/about-link/|archive-date=30 April 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faster Payments Service===
VocaLink designed, built and operates the infrastructure for the Faster Payments Service on behalf of the Faster Payments Scheme. Running in parallel with Bacs and [[CHAPS]], launched in 2008 it enables interbank transfers in real time. Since 2008, over three billion Faster Payments transactions have been securely processed by VocaLink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realbusiness.co.uk/article/15026-late-payments-debt-high-enough-to-put-uk-smes-out-of-business|title=Late payments debt high enough to put UK SMEs out of business|author=Vanessa Zainzinger|publisher=Real Business|date=28 September 2012|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile payments==

===Paym===
{{main|Paym}}
VocaLink provides the underlying technology to [[Paym]], a [[mobile payment]] system for the UK developed by the Payments Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paym overview|url=http://www.paymentscouncil.org.uk/mobile_payments/overview_of_paym/|publisher=Payments Council|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recipients are identified by their [[mobile phone]] number instead of bank details such as [[sort code]] and account number.&lt;ref name=BBC26836380&gt;{{cite news|title=Payments via mobile number to start this month|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26836380|publisher=BBC News|date=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched through participating banks and building societies in April 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is involved?|url=http://www.paymentscouncil.org.uk/mobile_payments/who_is_involved/|publisher=Payments Council|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and once users opt-in will by the end of 2014 support 9 out of 10 UK bank accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Papworth|first=Jill|title=Paym promises mobile-to-mobile current account payments|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/10/payem-mobile-current-account-payments|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zapp===
VocaLink has developed Zapp, a function that will reside within mobile banking apps to allow users to make real-time payments to retailers when shopping online or in-store. The service will be open to all financial institutions, merchants, acquirers and consumers, when it launches in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25727333|title=UK lenders to offer Zapp payments in banking apps|author=Leo Kelion|publisher=BBC News|date=January 15, 2014|accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2016}}

A Zapp payment works through secure digital 'tokens', which means that customers don’t reveal any of their financial details to retailers. This also means that merchants do not need to store card details.

Zapp has been developed by VocaLink who operate the UK payments infrastructure. VocaLink processes over 90% of UK salaries, more than 70% of household bills and 98% of state benefits. In 2013 VocaLink processed over 10 billion transactions with a value of over £5 trillion.

On 12 July 2010 through [[Euro Alliance of Payment Schemes|EAPS]], LINK opened all UK cash machines to the similar German [[Girocard]] scheme operated by [[Zentraler Kreditausschuss]].&lt;ref name="LINK mit Zentraler Kreditausschuss"&gt;{{cite web|title=UK ATMs open to German Girocard Holders|url=http://www.link.co.uk/media/news-releases/news-releases-archive/uk-atms-open-to-german-girocard-holders/|publisher=LINK|accessdate=16 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229053208/http://link.co.uk/media/news-releases/news-releases-archive/uk-atms-open-to-german-girocard-holders/|archive-date=29 December 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the VocaLink agreement with the Pulse network allows [[Discover card]] and [[Diners Club]] International cardholders to use LINK ATMs.&lt;ref name="DINERS CLUB"&gt;{{cite news|title=DINERS CLUB INTERNATIONAL CARDS GAIN ACCESS TO THE LINK ATM NETWORK|url=https://www.dinersclub.com/about-us/press/diners-club-international-cards-gain-access-to-the-link-atm-network|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; VocaLink also provides a gateway service to [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[MasterCard]] and [[China Union Pay]].

Between 2007 and 2012, VocaLink operated a [[Single Euro Payments Area]] clearing and settlement mechanism, participating as a member of the [[European Automated Clearing House Association]]. The service was discontinued as a consequence of the low participation of VocaLink's shareholder UK banks into the platform.&lt;ref name="VocaLink SEPA"&gt;{{cite web|title=VocaLink ditches Sepa services|url=http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=22884|publisher=Finextra|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, VocaLink signed a deal with the Swedish Automated Clearing House [[Bankgirot]], to outsource part of the Swedish payments system. This was the first time that the processing of a national payments scheme has been transferred to a non-domestic player.&lt;ref name="VocaLink BGC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bankgirocentralen BGC AB launches strategic partnership with VocaLink|url=http://www.bgc.se/templates/NewsPage____6813.aspx|publisher=BGC|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, in partnership with [[BCS Information Systems]], VocaLink launched an immediate payments service, [[Fast And Secure Transfers]] (FAST) in [[Singapore]], enabling fourteen Singaporean banks to offer the ability to transfer funds between bank accounts in real time.

'''Wayne Cao''' (born '''Nguyễn Cảo'''; December 7, 1946) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician and former member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], where he represented the district of [[Calgary-Fort]] as a [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative]].  He was first elected in the [[Alberta general election, 1997|1997 provincial election]] and was re-elected four times.  He is perhaps best known as the sponsor of the legislation that led to the enshrining of ''[[Alberta (song)|Alberta]]''.  In April 2008, he elected as the Legislature's Deputy [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] and Chair of Committees and served in that position for the 27th Legislature.  Mr. Cao also served as a member of the Standing Committee on Resource Stewardship.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.assembly.ab.ca/committees/resourcestewardship/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Cao was born December 7, 1946 in northern Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachers.ab.ca/Quick+Links/Publications/Other+Publications/Proceedings+of+Under+the+Umbrella+Round+Two/umbrella04.htm |title=Speech by Wayne Cao from the Alberta Teachers' Association website |accessdate=2008-04-15}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied [[engineering]], [[mathematics]], and [[computing science]] in [[Saigon]] and at the [[University of Auckland]] and the [[University of Waterloo]].&lt;ref name="leg bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_bio&amp;rnumber=11  |title=Wayne Cao's Legislative Assembly of Alberta biography |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=2010-03-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061005100827/https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_bio&amp;rnumber=11 |archivedate = 2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Vietnam War]], he came to [[California]] as a [[refugee]] - he boarded an American [[helicopter]] just before the [[fall of Saigon]] - and settled in [[Calgary]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="Calgary Sun"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.calgarysun.com/election/candidates.html |title=Calgary candidate profiles, Alberta election 2008 |publisher=[[Calgary Sun]] |accessdate=2008-04-16 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080304160950/http://www.calgarysun.com/election/candidates.html |archivedate=2008-03-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=6b036756-754f-4340-9518-73d0b0b1c7b4&amp;k=58288 |title=Vietnamese-Albertans honoured with Centennial Medals |publisher=[[Edmonton Journal]] |date=February 5, 2006 |accessdate=2008-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830103602/http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=6b036756-754f-4340-9518-73d0b0b1c7b4&amp;k=58288 |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He worked for [[Shell Petroleum]] for twenty-six years before taking [[early retirement]] in 1997 to enter politics.&lt;ref name="leg bio"/&gt;  During this time, he also lectured at the [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="leg bio"/&gt;

== Political career ==

Cao first sought public office in the [[Alberta general election, 1997|1997 provincial election]], when he ran in the riding of [[Calgary Fort|Calgary-Fort]] as the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative]].&lt;ref name="results"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/process/election_results.html |title=Alberta's past election results |accessdate=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected handily, and was re-elected in each of the next three elections.&lt;ref name="results"/&gt;  He supported [[Jim Dinning]] in the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta leadership election, 2006|2006 P.C. leadership race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Alberta/2006/10/05/1957089.html |title=Dinning supported by most of Tory caucus |publisher=[[Edmonton Sun]] |date=October 5, 2006 |accessdate=2008-04-16}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative initiatives===

Cao has moved a large number of [[private member's bill]]s.  Of these, the only one to pass was 2001's ''Alberta Official Song Act'', which established a contest for the province's official song, with the winner to be selected by an all party committee of the legislature.  It passed with the support of members from all parties, although [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative]] [[Rob Renner]] felt that the province's official song should be something that was already known to most Albertans rather than a new song composed for the occasion, and [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]] [[Hugh MacDonald (politician)|Hugh MacDonald]] argued that no official song was necessary, since Alberta already had an "unofficial song", [[Don Quixote (album)|Alberta Bound]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard | url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files%5Cdocs%5Chansards%5Chan%5Clegislature_25%5Csession_1%5C20010523_1330_01_han.pdf |format=PDF| house=Legislative Assembly of Alberta | date=May 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which MacDonald recalled hearing [[Ian Tyson]] sing at the closing ceremonies of the [[1988 Winter Olympics]], although the song, along with [[Four Strong Winds]], was actually sung at the opening ceremonies by Tyson and [[Gordon Lightfoot]], the song's composer and singer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Cam |last=Cole |title=Memory of five alive |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/features/2010/story.html?id=f2687ada-bd7c-4296-a92c-63c0a4d80505&amp;k=16701&amp;p=1 |date=February 12, 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-16 |publisher=[[Vancouver Sun]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104064655/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/features/2010/story.html?id=f2687ada-bd7c-4296-a92c-63c0a4d80505&amp;k=16701&amp;p=1 |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ensuing competition selected ''[[Alberta (song)|Alberta]]'', composed by Mary Kieftenbeld, as the province's official song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/11/17/songcontest_051117.html |title=Secrecy shrouds Albertans' song lyrics |date=November 17, 2005 |accessdate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cao followed this bill with efforts to encourage the translation of [[O Canada]] into all languages spoken by Canadians; he composed a [[Vietnamese (language)|Vietnamese]] version and sang it on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waynecao.com/oldsite/bio.asp |title=Cao's biography from his website |accessdate=2007-07-02 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702070635/http://www.waynecao.com/oldsite/bio.asp |archivedate=2007-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WayneCaoDeputySpeaker2.jpg|left|thumb|Wayne Cao, Deputy Speaker, Legislature, Alberta, Canada 2008]]

Cao also made headlines in 2007 with the ''School (Canadian History Content) Amendment Act'', which would have mandated that 75% of the instructional hours in high school [[social studies]] courses be devoted to [[History of Canada|Canadian history]].&lt;ref name="Canadian content"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/story.html?id=a70bed30-3f41-4586-8800-39f28889d2ca&amp;k=52083 |title=Critics see no future in history bill |publisher=[[Calgary Herald]] |first=Jason |last=Fekete |date=November 15, 2007 |accessdate=2008-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206124342/http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/story.html?id=a70bed30-3f41-4586-8800-39f28889d2ca&amp;k=52083 |archivedate=December 6, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several MLAs spoke in opposition to the bill, including [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]] [[Bill Bonko]] (who felt, as a former school trustee, that any percentage should be mandated by local school boards) and [[Harry B. Chase|Harry Chase]], [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrat]] [[David Eggen]] (who suggested that global history was as or more important than [[Canadians|Canadian]] history), and [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative]] Education Minister [[Ron Liepert]] (who agreed with Eggen and who extolled the virtues of the recently implemented existing social studies curriculum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard | url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files%5Cdocs%5Chansards%5Chan%5Clegislature_26%5Csession_3%5C20071203_1300_01_han.pdf |format=PDF| house=Legislative Assembly of Alberta | date=December 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Outside of the legislature, Progressive Conservatives [[Neil Brown (Canadian politician)|Neil Brown]] and [[Len Webber]] expressed reservations about the decision being made at the political, rather than local, level.&lt;ref name="Canadian content"/&gt;  The legislature adjourned before the bill came to a vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-bill07.htm |title=Bill Status Report for the 26th Legislature - 3rd Session (2007) |accessdate=2008-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604234245/http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-bill07.htm |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cao also sponsored the ''Employment Standards (Parental Leave) Amendment Act'', which would have combined the provisions for adoptive leave and [[maternity leave]] and extended them to 27 weeks (Alberta's maternity leave provisions were, at the time, the least generous in the country).&lt;ref name="May 16"&gt;{{cite hansard | url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files%5Cdocs%5Chansards%5Chan%5Clegislature_24%5Csession_4%5C20000516_1330_01_han.pdf |format=PDF| house=Legislative Assembly of Alberta | date=May 16, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He first introduced the bill in 1999, but the legislature adjourned before it reached second reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-b99_p.htm |title=Bill Status Report for the 24th Legislature - 3rd Session (1999) |accessdate=2008-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803201430/http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-b99_p.htm |archivedate=2007-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He re-introduced it in 2000, when several MLAs, including Liberals [[Don Massey]], [[Laurie Blakeman]], [[Linda Sloan]], and [[Percy Wickman]] and Progressive Conservatives [[Moe Amery]], [[Karen Kryczka]], and [[Mary Anne Jablonski]], spoke in support of the bill on second reading.&lt;ref name="May 16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="May 23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="November 15"/&gt;  Only [[Shiraz Shariff]] spoke against, citing concerns that the business community hadn't been sufficiently consulted.&lt;ref name="May 23"&gt;{{cite hansard | url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files%5Cdocs%5Chansards%5Chan%5Clegislature_24%5Csession_4%5C20000523_1330_01_han.pdf |format=PDF| house=Legislative Assembly of Alberta | date=May 23, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill passed second reading with 34 votes in favour and four ([[Gary Friedel]], [[Richard Magnus]], [[Barry McFarland]], and [[Rob Renner]]) against.&lt;ref name="November 15"&gt;{{cite hansard | url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files%5Cdocs%5Chansards%5Chan%5Clegislature_24%5Csession_4%5C20001115_1330_01_han.pdf |format=PDF| house=Legislative Assembly of Alberta | date=November 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the legislature adjourned while the bill was still in committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-b00_p.htm |title=Bill Status Report for the 24th Legislature - 4th Session (2000) |accessdate=2008-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803201419/http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-b00_p.htm |archivedate=2007-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Cao sponsored the ''Alberta Volunteer Service Medal Act'', which would have established a medal for exceptional volunteers.&lt;ref name="April 21"&gt;{{cite hansard | url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files%5Cdocs%5Chansards%5Chan%5Clegislature_27%5Csession_1%5C20080421_1330_01_han.pdf |format=PDF| house=Legislative Assembly of Alberta | date=April 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It received bipartisan support from Progressive Conservatives [[Jonathan Denis]], [[Carl Benito]], [[Neil Brown (Canadian politician)|Neil Brown]], and [[Greg Weadick]] and Liberals [[Hugh MacDonald (politician)|Hugh MacDonald]] and [[Darshan Kang]], but was ultimately [[hoist (motion)|hoisted]] on a motion from Progressive Conservative [[Fred Horne]].&lt;ref name="April 21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="April 28"&gt;{{cite hansard | url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files%5Cdocs%5Chansards%5Chan%5Clegislature_27%5Csession_1%5C20080428_1330_01_han.pdf |format=PDF| house=Legislative Assembly of Alberta | date=April 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill's opponents included Liberal [[Harry B. Chase]] (who felt that the government's role in volunteer recognition should come in the form of support, rather than in the form of after-the-fact recognition) and Progressive Conservatives [[Richard Marz]] (who argued that medals should be restricted to those who had risked their lives), [[Heather Forsyth]] (who was concerned by the level of bureaucracy in the bill), [[George Rogers (Canadian politician)|George Rogers]] (who suggested that it duplicated existing government programs), [[Ray Prins]] (who was concerned that by singling out individual volunteers it would demean the contributions of those who weren't recognized), and [[Doug Griffiths]] (who echoed Rogers' arguments and also expressed concern that the proposed award would have a built in bias in favour of volunteers with large organizations).&lt;ref name="April 21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="April 28"/&gt;

His other private member's bills have included 1997's ''Highway Traffic Amendment Act'', 2002's ''Environmental Protection and Enhancement (Residential Land Disclosure) Amendment Act'', 2003's ''Financial Summit Act'', and 2004's ''Government Accountability (Identification of Expenditures) Amendment Act'', none of which reached second reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-bill97.htm |title=Bill Status Report for the 24th Legislature - 1st Session (1997) |accessdate=2008-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803201506/http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-bill97.htm |archivedate=2007-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-bill02.htm |title=Bill Status Report for the 25th Legislature - 2nd Session (2002) |accessdate=2008-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803201442/http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-bill02.htm |archivedate=2007-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2003 Bills"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-bill03.htm |title=Bill Status Report for the 25th Legislature - 3rd Session (2003) |accessdate=2008-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803201322/http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-bill03.htm |archivedate=2007-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-bill04.htm |title=Bill Status Report for the 25th Legislature - 4th Session (2004) |accessdate=2008-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113224551/http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-bill04.htm |archivedate=2008-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his private member's bills, Cao has sponsored a government bill, the ''Tobacco Tax Amendment Act'' of 2003.&lt;ref name="2003 Bills"/&gt;  The bill was in response to an increase in the number of Albertans buying tobacco products out of province, after the government imposed taxes on the import of tobacco products to Alberta that saw taxes on such goods more than double.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard | url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files%5Cdocs%5Chansards%5Chan%5Clegislature_25%5Csession_3%5C20030415_2000_01_han.pdf |format=PDF| house=Legislative Assembly of Alberta | date=April 15, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It passed after little debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard | url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files%5Cdocs%5Chansards%5Chan%5Clegislature_25%5Csession_3%5C20030512_2000_01_han.pdf |format=PDF| house=Legislative Assembly of Alberta | date=May 12, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cao also sponsored a successful [[private bill]] in 1998, the ''Tanya Marie Bryant Adoption Termination Act''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-b98_p.htm |title=Bill Status Report for the 24th Legislature - 2nd Session (1998) |accessdate=2008-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803201511/http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-b98_p.htm |archivedate=2007-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry''''', is a [[2005 in literature|2005]] [[non-fiction]] book by [[John Markoff]].  The book details the [[History of computing hardware (1960s-present)|history of the personal computer]], closely tying the ideologies of the [[collaboration]]-driven, [[World War II]]-era [[defense industry|defense research community]] to the embryonic [[cooperatives]] and [[psychedelics]] use of the American [[counterculture of the 1960s]].

The book follows the history chronologically, beginning with [[Vannevar Bush]]'s description of his inspirational [[memex]] machine in his 1945 article "[[As We May Think]]". Markoff describes many of the people and organizations who helped develop the ideology and technology of the computer as we know it today, including [[Doug Engelbart]], [[Xerox PARC]], [[Apple Computer]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].

Markoff argues for a direct connection between the counterculture of the late 1950s and 1960s (using examples such as [[Kepler's Books]] in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]] [[California]]) and the development of the computer industry. The book also discusses the early split between the idea of commercial and free-supply computing.

The main part of the title, "What the Dormouse Said," is a reference to a line at the end of the 1967 [[Jefferson Airplane]] song "[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]": "Remember what [[The Dormouse|the dormouse]] said: feed your head."&lt;ref name=AmSci&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lanier|first1=Jaron|title=Early Computing's Long, Strange Trip.

He also describes how a new culture of drugs, sex and rock and roll was created at the same time as the computers, sometimes in the same rooms, by some of the same people.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is itself a reference to [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.
