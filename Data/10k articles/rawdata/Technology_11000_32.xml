An '''ABA routing transit number''' ('''ABA RTN''') is a nine-digit [[code]], used in the [[United States]], which appears on the bottom of [[Negotiable instrument|negotiable instruments]] such as [[cheque|checks]] to identify the [[financial institution]] on which it was drawn. The ABA RTN was originally designed to facilitate the sorting, bundling, and shipment of paper checks back to the drawer's (check writer's) account.  As new payment methods were developed ([[ACH Network|ACH]] and [[wire transfer|Wire]]), the system was expanded to accommodate these payment methods.

The ABA RTN is necessary for the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s to process [[Fedwire]] funds transfers, and by the [[ACH Network]] to process [[wiktionary:direct deposit|direct deposit]]s, bill payments, and other such automated transfers.

The ABA RTN system was developed in 1910 by the [[American Bankers Association]].&lt;ref name="bo04"&gt;{{harv|Bankers' Hotline|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Since 1911, the American Bankers Association has partnered with a series of registrars, currently [[Accuity]], to manage the ABA routing number system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accuitysolutions.com/co-press-release.html?id=20080114QK8G3EH8]&lt;/ref&gt; Accuity is the Official Routing Number Registrar and is responsible for assigning ABA RTNs and managing the ABA RTN system. Accuity publishes the ''American Bankers Association Key to Routing Numbers'' semi-annually.  The "Key Book" contains the listing of all ABA RTNs that have been assigned.

There are approximately 26,895 active ABA RTNs currently in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fededirectory.frb.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828003522/http://www.fededirectory.frb.org/ |archive-date=2008-08-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every financial institution in the United States has at least one. The Routing Number Policy allows for up to five ABA RTNs to be assigned to a financial institution.  Many institutions have more than five ABA RTNs as a result of mergers.

ABA RTNs are only for use in payment transactions within the United States.  They are used on paper check, wire transfers, and ACH transactions.  On a paper check, the ABA RTN is usually the middle set of nine numbers printed at the bottom of the check. Domestic transfers that use the ABA RTN will usually be returned to the paying bank.

Incoming international wire transfers also use a BIC code, also known as a SWIFT code, as they are administered by the [[SWIFT|Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)]] and defined by [[ISO 9362]]. In addition, many international financial institutions use an [[IBAN]] code.

The [[IBAN]] was originally developed to facilitate payments within the European Union but the format is flexible enough to be applied globally. It consists of an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, followed by two check digits that are calculated using a mod-97 technique, and Basic Bank Account Number ([[BBAN]]) with up to thirty alphanumeric characters. The BBAN includes the domestic bank account number and potentially routing information. The national banking communities decide individually on a fixed length for all BBAN in their country.

== History ==
[[Image:The Burroughs transit machine - an adding machine that types statements with carbon copies.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In 1911 the new Burroughs Transit Machine, made by the [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs Adding Machine Company]], was advertised in the first edition of the bank directory ''Key to Numerical System of the [[American Bankers Association|American Bankers' Association]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|McNally]], pp. 497–512&lt;/ref&gt;]]The bank numbers in the [[United States]] were originated by the [[American Bankers Association]] (ABA) in 1911. Banks had been disagreeing on identification. The ABA arranged a meeting of clearing house managers in Chicago in December 1910. The gathering chose a committee to assign each bank in the country convenient numbers to use. In May 1911, the American Bankers Association released the codes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|McNally]], p. V&lt;/ref&gt; The numerical committee was W. G. Schroeder, C. R. McKay, and J. A. Walker.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|McNally]], p. VIII&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher of the new directory was [[Rand McNally|Rand-McNally]] and Company.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|McNally]], p. III&lt;/ref&gt; The ABA clearing house codes are like the sub-headings in a decimal outline. The prefixes mean locations and the suffixes banking firms within those locations. Half of the prefixes represent major cities the other half represent regions of the United States. Lower prefixes are used for higher populations, first based on the 1910 U. S. Census. Likewise, within each prefix area banks are numbered in order of city population and bank seniority, although single-bank towns are numbered in alphabetical order. When a new bank is being organized, the current publisher of the directory of banks assigns it a transit code.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|McNally]], pp. V-VI&lt;/ref&gt; The American Bankers Association asked banks to use the directory exclusively so banks would agree on how to sort checks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|McNally]], pp. VI-VIII&lt;/ref&gt; The book was abbreviated ''Key to Numerical System of The American Bankers Association,'' and as the ''Key''. It was published by Rand McNally &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|McNally]], p. VI&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 by Rand McNally moved its corporate headquarters to Skokie, Illinois, and became more interested in publishing maps.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|RM Acq]], p. Our History&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Skokie is a company called Accuity, which from its history has been the official registrar of ABA bank numbers since 1911. By 2014  it was the publisher of the semi-annual ''ABA Key to Routing Numbers'' and was owned by Reed Business Information, British publisher of reference works for professionals, which in turn is owned by Reed-Elsevier, English-Dutch publisher of online format reference works for professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Acuity, Bankers']], p. About us&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|Reed Elsevier]], p. Our history&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years the ABA's identification numbers for banks accommodated the [[Federal Reserve Act]], the Expedited Funds Act and the Check 21 Act. By 2014 the ''Key'' included the U. S. Federal Reserve's nine-digit magnetic-ink routing numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sources|ABA]], p. Key to Routing Numbers—Accuity&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formats==
[[File:Knuth-check2.png|300px|thumb|right|A check showing the fraction form (top middle-right, ''11-3167/1210'' plus branch number 01) and MICR form (bottom left, ''129131673'') of the transit number.]]
The ABA RTN appears in two forms on a standard check – the fraction form and the [[MICR]] (magnetic ink character recognition) form.&lt;ref name="bo04" /&gt; Both forms give essentially the same information, though there are slight differences.

The MICR forms are the main form&amp;nbsp;– it is printed in magnetic ink, and is machine-readable; it appears at the bottom left of a check, and consists of nine digits.

The fraction form was used for manual processing before the invention of the MICR line, and still serves as a backup in check processing should the MICR line become illegible or torn; it generally appears in the upper right part of a check near the date.

The MICR number is of the form
: XXXXYYYYC
where XXXX is Federal Reserve Routing Symbol, YYYY is ABA Institution Identifier,
and C is the Check Digit, while the fraction is of the form:
: PP-YYYY/XXXX
where PP is a 1 or 2 digit Prefix, no longer used in processing, but still printed, representing the bank's check processing center location, with 1 through 49 for processing centers located in a major city, and 50 through 99 representing processing is done at a non-major city in a particular state. Sometimes a branch number or the account number are printed below the fraction form; branch number is not used in processing, while the account number is listed in MICR form at the bottom. Further, the Federal Reserve Routing Symbol and ABA Institution Identifier  may have fewer than 4 digits in the fraction form. The essential data, shared by both forms, is the Federal Reserve Routing Symbol (XXXX), and the ABA Institution Identifier (YYYY), and these are usually the same in both the fraction form and the MICR, with only the order and format switched (and left-padded with 0s to ensure that they are 4 digits long).

The prefix and the Federal Reserve Routing Symbol (XXXX) are determined by the bank's geographical location and treatment by the Federal Reserve type, while the remaining data (YYYY, and Branch number, if present) depends on the specific bank, and are unique within a Federal Reserve district.

In the check depicted above right, the fraction form is ''11-3167/1210'' (with ''01'' below it) and MICR form is ''129131673'' which are analyzed as follows:
* the ''prefix'' 11 corresponds to San Francisco,
* 3167 (common to both) is the ABA Institution Identifier,
* 1210 and 1291 are the Federal Reserve Routing Symbols (generally equal, here different probably due to obfuscation, see image file history for more information), with the initial "12" corresponding to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the third digits ("1" and "9") corresponding to check processing centers, and the fourth digits ("0" and "1") corresponding to where the bank is located&amp;nbsp;– "0" indicates "in the Federal Reserve city of San Francisco", while "1" indicates "in the state of California".
* the final "3" in the MICR is the check digit, and
* the "01" below the fraction form is the branch number.

In the case of a MICR line that is illegible or torn, the check can still be processed without the check digit. Typically, a repair strip or sleeve is attached to the check, then a new MICR line is imprinted. Either 021200025 or 0212-0002 (with a hyphen, but no check digit) may be printed, and both are 9 digits. The former (with check digit) is preferred to ensure better accuracy, but requires computing the check digit, while the latter is easily determined by inspection of the fraction, with minimal clerical handling.

===MICR Routing number format===
The MICR routing number consists of 9 digits:
: XXXXYYYYC
where XXXX is Federal Reserve Routing Symbol, YYYY is ABA Institution Identifier,
and C is the Check Digit.

====Federal Reserve====
The Federal Reserve uses the ABA RTN system for processing its customers' payments.  The ABA RTNs were originally assigned in the systematic way outlined below, reflecting a financial institution's geographical location and internal handling by the Federal Reserve. Following consolidation of the Federal Reserve's check processing facilities, and the consolidation in the banking industry, the RTN a financial institution uses may not reflect the "Fed District" where the financial institution's place of business is located.  Check processing is now centralized at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.&lt;ref name="bur05"&gt;{{Harv|Burnett|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two digits of the nine digit RTN must be in the ranges 00 through 12, 21 through 32, 61 through 72, or 80.

The digits are assigned as follows:
* 00 is used by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]]
* 01 through 12 are the "normal" routing numbers, and correspond to the 12 [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s. For example, 0260-0959-3 is the routing number for Bank of America incoming wires in New York, with the initial "02" indicating the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]].
* 21 through 32 were assigned only to [[Cooperative banking|thrift institutions]] (e.g. [[credit union]]s and savings banks) through 1985, but are no longer assigned (thrifts are assigned normal 01–12 numbers). Currently they are still used by the thrift institutions, or their successors, and correspond to the normal routing number, plus 20. (For example, 2260-7352-3 is the routing number for Grand Adirondack Federal Credit Union in New York, with the initial "22" corresponding to "02" (New York Fed) plus "20" (thrift).)
* 61 through 72 are special purpose routing numbers designated for use by non-bank payment processors and clearinghouses and are termed Electronic Transaction Identifiers (ETIs), and correspond to the normal routing number, plus 60.
* 80 is used for [[traveler's check]]s

The first two digits correspond to the 12 [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s as follows:

{| class="wikitable"

|-
|11 || 31 || 71 || [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Dallas]]
|-
|12 || 32 || 72 || [[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco|San Francisco]]
|}

The third digit corresponds to the Federal Reserve check processing center originally assigned to the bank.&lt;ref name="bur05" /&gt;

The fourth digit is "0" if the bank is located in the Federal Reserve city proper, and otherwise is 1–9, according to which state in the Federal Reserve district it is.&lt;ref name="bur05" /&gt;

====ABA Institution Identifier====
The fifth through eighth digits constitute the bank's unique ABA identity within the given Federal Reserve district.&lt;ref name="bur05" /&gt;

====Check digit====
The ninth, [[check digit]] provides a [[checksum]] test using a position-weighted sum of each of the digits. High-speed check-sorting equipment will typically verify the checksum and if it fails, route the item to a reject pocket for manual examination, repair, and re-sorting. Mis-routings to an incorrect bank are thus greatly reduced.

The following condition must hold:&lt;ref name="bo04" /&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;3 (d_1 + d_4 + d_7) + 7 (d_2 + d_5 + d_8) + (d_3 + d_6 + d_9) \mod 10 = 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
: ([[Modulo operation|Mod]] or modulo is the remainder of a division operation.)
In terms of weights, this is 371 371 371. This allows one to catch any single-digit error (incorrectly inputting one digit), together with most transposition errors. 1, 3, and 7 are used because they (together with 9) are [[coprime]] to 10; using a coefficient that is divisible by 2 or 5 would lose information (because &lt;math&gt;5 \cdot 0 = 5 \cdot 2 = 5 \cdot 4 = 5 \cdot 6 = 5 \cdot 8 = 0 \mod 10&lt;/math&gt;), and thus would not catch some substitution errors. These do not catch transpositions of two digits that differ by 5 (0 and 5, 1 and 6, 2 and 7, 3 and 8, 4 and 9), but captures other transposition errors.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

As an example, consider 111000025 (which is a valid routing number of [[Bank of America]] in [[Virginia]]). Applying the formula, we get:

: &lt;math&gt;3 (1+0+0) + 7 (1+0+2) + (1+0+5) \mod 10  = 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

====Routing symbol====
The symbol that delimits a routing transit number is the [[MICR]] [[E-13B]] transit character (Unicode value U+2446): ⑆

If your computer cannot display this character, it may be seen [http://www.decodeunicode.org/en/u+2446 here].

===Fraction format===
The fraction form looks like a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]], with a [[numerator]] and a [[denominator]].

The numerator consists of two parts separated by a dash. The prefix (no longer used in check processing, yet still printed on most checks) is a 1 or 2 digit code (P or PP) indicating the region where the bank is located. The numbers 1 to 49 are cities, assigned by size of the cities in 1910. The numbers 50 to 99 are states, assigned in a rough spatial geographic order, and are used for banks located outside one of the 49 numbered cities.

The second part of the numerator (after the dash) is the bank's ABA Institution Identifier, which also forms digits 5 to 8 of the nine digit routing number (YYYY).

The denominator is also part of the routing number; by adding leading zeroes to make up four digits where necessary (e.g. 212 is written as 0212, 31 is written as 0031, etc.), it forms the first four digits of the routing number (XXXX).

There might also be a fourth element printed to the right of the fraction: this is the bank's branch number. It is not included in the MICR line. It would only be used internally by the bank, e.g. to show where the signature card is located, where to contact the responsible officer in case of an overdraft, etc.

For example, a check from Wachovia Bank in Yardley, PA, has a fraction of 55-2/212 and a routing number of 021200025. The prefix (55) no longer has any relevance, but from the remainder of the fraction, the first 8 digits of the routing number (02120002) can be determined, and the check digit (the last digit, 5 in this example) can be calculated by using the [[#Internal checksums|check digit formula]] (thus giving 021200025).

====ABA Prefix Table====
This table is up to date as of 2009. One weakness of the current routing table arrangement is that Alaska, American Samoa, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands share the same routing code.

      <comment>instead of referring to an easily misleading 800 year period of a "zhou dynasty" it's better to speak of "western zhou" (1046-771), "eastern zhou"/"spring and autumn period" (771-475), and "warring states period" (475-221)</comment>

'''Ancient Chinese glass''' refers to all types of [[glass]] manufactured in [[China]] prior to the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1911). In Chinese history, glass played a peripheral role in the arts and crafts, when compared to ceramics and metal work.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002a&lt;/ref&gt; The limited archaeological distribution and use of glass objects are evidence of the rarity of the material. Literary sources date the first manufacture of glass to the 5th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Jenyns 1981&lt;/ref&gt; However, the earliest archaeological evidence for glass manufacture in China comes from the [[Warring States period]] (475 BC to 221 BC).

Chinese learned to manufacture glass comparatively later than the Mesopotamians, Egyptians and Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, p 140&lt;/ref&gt; Imported glass objects first reached China during the late [[Spring and Autumn period]] – early [[Warring States period]] (early 5th century BC), in the form of polychrome ‘[[eye bead]]s’.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, p 6&lt;/ref&gt; These imports created the impetus for the production of indigenous glass beads.

During the Han period (206 BC to 220 AD) the use of glass diversified. The introduction of glass casting in this period encouraged the production of moulded objects, such as bi disks and other ritual objects.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991 p140&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese glass objects from the Warring States period and [[Han Dynasty]] vary greatly in chemical composition from the imported glass objects. The glasses from this period contain high levels of [[barium oxide]] (BaO) and [[lead]], distinguishing them from the soda-lime-silica glasses of Western Asia and Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr and Wood 2004, pp 474-477&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Han Dynasty (AD 220), the lead-barium glass tradition declined, with glass production only resuming during the 4th and 5th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;An Jiayao 2002, pp 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical composition of Warring States and Han period glasses==

&lt;blockquote&gt;At present, it is accepted that in China, glassmaking began around the 5th century BCE during the late Spring and Autumn to early Warring States periods. Chemical analyses of glass samples dating to this time have identified no less than three glass systems: potash-lime, lead-barium, and potash; of these, lead-barium was the most significant in early China.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher F. Kim (2012), [http://brown.edu/Departments/Joukowsky_Institute/undergrad/prizes/Kim2012.pdf Early Chinese Lead-Barium Glass; Its Production and Use from the Warring States to Han Periods (475 BCE-220 CE)], PDF file&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the Warring States period and the Han Dynasty (5th century BC to early 3rd century AD) glass was imported from regions outside of East Asia, such as Mesopotamia. Imported Western faience and glass probably inspired the production of the first Chinese glasses. The main group of objects with Western influences are eye beads or dragonfly-eyed beads.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr and Wood 2004, p474&lt;/ref&gt; The key difference between Near Eastern eye beads and Chinese eye beads is their chemical composition. The coloured glasses used to produce the Chinese eye beads have a high lead and barium content. This type of composition was exclusive to China; and it was used to produce a range of glass objects until the end of the Han Dynasty.

Table 1 shows examples of chemical compositions of some Chinese glass objects.

''Table 1: Elemental compositions of Chinese glass from the Warring States Period to Han Dynasty. Data from the first 4 objects was taken from Brill et al. 1991; data from glass garment plaque was taken from Cheng Zhuhai and Zhou Changyuan 1991; and data from the ritual disk was taken from Shi Meiguang 1991.''

The Chinese lead-barium glasses typically present 5 to 15% BaO. The source of barium in the glass in not clear; however it is possible that ancient Chinese glassmakers used witherite (a mineral form of [[barium carbonate]]) as an ingredient.&lt;ref name="Brill et al. 1991, p 34"&gt;Brill et al. 1991, p 34&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a separate ingredient implies that barium had a specific function. This function could have been to flux the glass, by lowering the melting point of the melt; or stabilize the glass, by making it less soluble to water.&lt;ref name="Brill et al. 1991, p 34" /&gt; It could also have been added to opacify the glass. [[Electron microprobe]] analysis of glass fragments have shown that the [[turbidity]] of certain lead-barium glasses is produced by barium disilicate crystals.&lt;ref name="Brill et al. 1991, p 34" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shi Meiguang et al. 1992, p 24&lt;/ref&gt; This turbidity gives the glasses a jade-like appearance.

==Glass objects in the Warring States and Han Periods==
The period between the Warring States period and the Han Dynasty shaped the early Chinese glass industry. Most of the glass objects from this period come from archaeological excavations of tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Fukang 1991, p 157&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, most glass objects have fairly secure dating and context. During this period Chinese mainly used glass to produce two distinct types of objects, [[polychrome]] eye beads and [[monochrome]] funerary objects&lt;ref name="Braghin 2002b"&gt;Braghin 2002b&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye Beads===
The earliest types of glass objects found in China are polychrome eye beads or dragonfly-eyed beads. The beads are found in burials from the late Spring and Autumn and early Warring States periods (early 5th century BC) up to late Warring State – early Western Han period.&lt;ref name="Braghin 2002b" /&gt; Most beads have a monochrome glass body covered by several layers of coloured glass. The layers of different colour glass are applied in alternating fashion to produce concentric circles.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, p 4&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns of circles resemble eyes, giving the beads their name. This style of bead originated in the Near East during the mid 2nd millennium BC. The stylistic influence later spread to the [[Mediterranean]], [[Central Asia]] and China.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr and Wood 2004, p 474&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 5th century BC, the imported eye beads were considered exotic objects. They were mainly deposited in high status burials, such as the tomb of a male aristocrat of the Qi state at Langjiazhuang, Shadong.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, pp 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; This situation changes during the middle and late Warring States Period. Eye beads from this period are manufactured from Chinese lead-barium glass and are mainly found in the regions of the middle [[Yangzi River]] Valley, indicating a connection to the Chu kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, pp 8-14&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the beads became more common and available to a larger part of the Chinese society. Evidence of this is the presence of eye beads in medium and small burials, with modest funerary furnishings, as well as large, high-status burials.

The use of eye beads in burials rapidly declined at the beginning of the Western Han period. This is believed to be a result of the invasion of Chu kingdom territories by Qin and Han armies at the end of the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, p 14&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse of the Chu kingdom would have brought production of eye-beads to an end.

===Monochrome opaque objects===
During the Warring States and Han periods, Chinese glassworkers took advantage of the similarities between glass and [[jade]]. In this period many glass objects, found in burial contexts, were made of opaque green, light green or milky white glass.&lt;ref&gt;Gao Zhixi 1991, 119&lt;/ref&gt; These objects have similar shapes to their jade counterpart, and were no doubt imitating that precious stone. Among these objects there were bi disks, ‘glass garments’ (or glass suits), sword accessories and vessels, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Jenyns, R. 1981, p 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenn 1991, pp 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cheng Zhuhai and Zhou Changyuan 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="An Jiayao 1991, p 7"&gt;An Jiayao 1991, p 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shi Meiguang et al. 1992"&gt;Shi Meiguang et al. 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Bi'' disks====
A [[Bi (jade)|''bi'' disk]] is a ritual object that resembles a flattened [[torus]]. The earliest archeological specimens were carved from stone (usually [[nephrite]]) and date back to the late Neolithic period; they became important burial elements during the 3rd millennium BC.&lt;ref name="Braghin 2002b" /&gt; They were placed on or near the head of the deceased person.

Glass ''bi'' disks are the most numerous kind of monochrome glass objects. They first became abundant in the Chu kingdom during the Warring States period. ''Bi'' disks from this period tend to be between 7.9 and 9.4&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Gao Zhixi 1991, p 119&lt;/ref&gt; The glass ''bi'' disks look very similar to their stone contemporaries, usually decorated on one side with a simple grain or cloud pattern typical of jade objects. They are mainly found in medium to small-sized tombs, indicating the middle strata of society rather than the elite.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, p 23&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that glass ''bi'' disks were regarded as cheaper alternatives to jade ''bi'' disks.

====Glass burial suit plaques====
Plaques from glass burial suits or glass garments are directly linked to jade objects.&lt;ref&gt;Fenn el al. 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, pp 28 -31&lt;/ref&gt; Several pieces of burial suit plaques have been found in a few wooden-chambered burials from the late West Han Dynasty. The plaques come in different shapes, with rectangular being the most common. Some of these rectangular pieces have perforations in 4 corners, indicating that they were strung together, or sewn into a fabric, to form a protective burial suit.&lt;ref name="Braghin 2002b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Other shapes, such as circular, triangular and rhomboidal, are often decorated with moulded patterns. All the glass plaque shapes have jade counterparts, suggesting that glass burial suits were a cheaper alternative to jade burial suits.

====Vessels====
The earliest known Chinese glass vessels come from Western Han Dynasty tombs. To this date only two tombs are known to have had glass vessels among their funerary objects: the tomb of the Liu Dao, Prince of Chu in [[Xuzhou]] (128 BC), [[Jiangsu Province]]; and the tomb of Liu Sheng, Prince Jing of Zhongshan (113BC) at [[Mancheng]].&lt;ref&gt;Braghin 2002b, pp 31-34&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb at Xuzhou contained 16 light green cylindrical cups;&lt;ref name="Shi Meiguang et al. 1992"/&gt; while Prince Liu Sheng’s tomb contained 2 shallow double-handled cups and a plate.&lt;ref name="An Jiayao 1991, p 7" /&gt; All of the vessels were traditional Chinese shapes and made of lead-barium glass. Vessels in these forms were normally made out of [[lacquer]] or ceramic, although some jade vessels in those shapes are also known.&lt;ref name="Braghin 2002b" /&gt; All vessels were produced by mould casting.

[[File:Stainless steel bifilar sundial (dial).jpg|thumb|Stainless steel bifilar sundial in Italy]]
[[File:Stainless steel bifilar sundial (gnomons).jpg|thumb|Particular of the steel threads]]
&lt;!--{{main|:fr:Cadran bifilaire}}--&gt;

A '''bifilar dial''' is a type of [[sundial]] invented by the German mathematician Hugo Michnik in 1922. It has two non-touching threads parallel to the dial.  Usually the second thread is [[orthogonal]]-(perpendicular) to the first.
{{sfn|Michnik|1922}}
The intersection of the two threads' shadows gives the [[local apparent time]].

When the threads have the correctly calculated separation, the hour-lines on the horizontal surface are uniformly drawn. The angle between successive hour-lines is constant. The hour-lines for successive hours are 15 degrees apart.

==History==
The bifilar dial was invented in April 1922 by the mathematician and maths teacher, Hugo Michnik, from [[Beuthen]], [[Upper Silesia]]. He studied the horizontal dial- starting on a conventional XYZ [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesian framework]] and building up a general projection which he states was an exceptional case of a [[Steiner's theorem (geometry)|Steiner transformation]]. He related the trace of the sun to [[conic section]]s and the angle on the dial-plate to the [[hour angle]] and the calculation of [[local apparent time]], using conventional hours and the historic [[Hour#Counting from sunset|Italian]] and [[Hour#Babylonian hours|Babylonian hours]]. {{sfn|Michnik|1922}} He refers in the paper, to a previous publication on the theory of sundials in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Beiträge zur Theorie der Sonnenuhren, Leipzig, 1914&lt;/ref&gt;

His method has been applied to vertical near-declinant dials, and a more general declining-reclining dial.

Work has been subsequently done by Dominique Collin.{{sfn|Collin|2000}}

== Horizontal bifilar dial ==
This was the dial that Hugo Michnik invented and studied. By simplifying the general example so:
:* the wires cross [[orthogonal]]ly- one running north-south and the other east-west
:* The east west wire passes under the north south dial, so the &lt;math&gt;h_2 = h_1 \sin\varphi\quad &lt;/math&gt; (latitude)
the shadow is thrown on a dial-plate marked out like a simple [[Sundial#Equatorial sundials|equatorial sundial]].

=== The proof ===
The first wire &lt;math&gt;f_1\,&lt;/math&gt; is orientated '''north-south''' at a constant distance &lt;math&gt;h_1\,&lt;/math&gt; from the dial plate &lt;math&gt;\Pi\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The second wire &lt;math&gt;f_2\,&lt;/math&gt; is orientated '''east-west''' at a constant distance &lt;math&gt;h_2\,&lt;/math&gt; from the dial plate &lt;math&gt;\Pi\,&lt;/math&gt; (thus &lt;math&gt;f_2\,&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;f_1\,&lt;/math&gt; which lies on the plane of the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] ).

In this proof &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced phi) is the [[latitude]] of the dial plate.

Respectively, &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal D_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal D_2)&lt;/math&gt; are the vertical projections of wires &lt;math&gt;f_1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2\,&lt;/math&gt; on the dial plate &lt;math&gt;\Pi\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Point &lt;math&gt;O\,&lt;/math&gt; is the point on the dial plate directly under the two wires' intersection.&lt;br&gt; That point is the origin of the X,Y co-ordinate system referred to below.

The X-axis is the east-west line passing through the origin. The Y-axis is the north-south line passing through the origin. The positive Y direction is northward.

One can show that if the position of the sun is known and determined by the [[Equatorial coordinate system#Spherical coordinates|spherical coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;t_\odot&lt;/math&gt; et &lt;math&gt;\delta\,&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced t-dot and delta, respectively the known as the [[hour angle]] et [[declination]]), the co-ordinates &lt;math&gt;x_I\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_I\,&lt;/math&gt; of point &lt;math&gt;I\,&lt;/math&gt;, the intersection on the two shadows on the dial-plate &lt;math&gt;\Pi\,&lt;/math&gt; have values of :

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
x_I &amp;=&amp; h_1 \frac {\sin t_\odot}{\sin\varphi\ \operatorname{tan}\delta\ + \ \cos\varphi\cos t_\odot} \\
\ &amp;\ &amp; \ \\
y_I &amp;=&amp; h_2 \frac{-\cos\varphi\ \operatorname{tan}\delta\ + \ \sin\varphi\cos t_\odot}{\sin\varphi\ \operatorname{tan}\delta\ + \ \cos\varphi\cos t_\odot}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Eliminating the variable &lt;math&gt;\delta\,&lt;/math&gt; in the two preceding equations, one obtains a new equation defined for &lt;math&gt;x_I\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_I\,&lt;/math&gt; which gives, as a function of the latitude &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and the solar hour angle solaire &lt;math&gt;t_\odot&lt;/math&gt;, the equation of the [[Algebraic curve|trace of the sun]] associated with the local apparent time. In its simplest form this equation is written:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x_I}{y_I + h_2/\operatorname{tan}\varphi} = \frac{h_1 \sin\varphi}{h_2}\ \operatorname{tan}t_\odot
&lt;/math&gt;
This relation shows that the hour traces are indeed [[line segment]]s and the meeting-point of these line segments is the point &lt;math&gt;C\,&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;math&gt;x_C = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;math&gt;y_C = -h_2 / \operatorname{tan}\varphi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

In other words, point C is south of point O (where the wires intersect), by a distance of &lt;code&gt;&lt;math&gt;h_2 / \operatorname{tan}\varphi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the latitude.{{sfn|Michnik|1922}}

;Special case
If one arranges the two wire heights &lt;math&gt;h_2\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_1\,&lt;/math&gt; such :

:&lt;code&gt; &lt;math&gt;h_2 = h_1 \sin\varphi\quad &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

then the equation for the hour lines can be simply written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x_I - x_C}{y_I - y_C} = \operatorname{tan}t_\odot&lt;/math&gt;
at all times,  the intersection &lt;math&gt;I\,&lt;/math&gt; of the shadows on the dial plate &lt;math&gt;\Pi\,&lt;/math&gt; is such that the angle &lt;math&gt;\widehat{OCI}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the [[hour angle]] &lt;math&gt;t_\odot&lt;/math&gt; of the sun so thus represents solar time.

So provided the sundial respects the la condition &lt;math&gt;h_2 = h_1 \sin\varphi\quad &lt;/math&gt; the trace of the sun corresponds to the hour-angle shown by [[Ray (geometry)|lines (rays)]] centred on the point &lt;math&gt;C\,&lt;/math&gt; and the 13 rays that correspond to the hours 6:00, 7:00, 8:00, 9:00... 15:00, 16:00, 17:00, 18:00 are regularly spaced at a constant angle of 15°, about point C. {{efn|This property was named the '''''homogenity of hour lines '''''' {{lang-fr|homogénéité des lignes horaires}} by the French mathematician Dominique Collin.}}{{sfn|Michnik|1922}}

===A practical example===
A London dial is the name given to dials set for 51° 30' N. A simple London bifilar dial has a dial plate with 13 line segments drawn outward from a centre-point C, with each hour's line drawn 15° clockwise from the previous hour's line. The midday line is aligned towards the north.

The north-south wire is 10 cm (&lt;math&gt;h_1&lt;/math&gt;) above the midday line. That east-west wire is placed at a height of 7.826 (&lt;math&gt;h_2&lt;/math&gt;) centimeters- equivalent to 10cm x sin(51° 30'). This passes through C. The east-west wire crosses the north-south wire 6.275 cm north of the centre-point C- that being the equivalent of - 7.826 (&lt;math&gt;h_2&lt;/math&gt;) divided by tan (51° 30').

For a Bifilar sundial, for latitude 51.5, with the north-south string 10 centimeters above the dial-face, the east-west string should be 7.826 centimeters above the dial-face.

Point C, where the hour-lines meet, and about which the hour-lines are drawn, at 15-degree intervals, should be 6.275 centimeters behind (south of) where the two strings intersect. --&gt;

== Reclining-declining bifilar sundials ==

Whether a sundial is a bifilar, or whether it's the familiar flat-dial with a straight style (like the usual horizontal and vertical-declining sundials), making it reclining, vertical-declining, or reclining-declining is exactly the same. The declining or reclining-declining mounting is achieved in exactly the same manner, whether the dial is bifilar, or the usual straight-style flat dial.

For any flat-dial, whether bifilar, or ordinary straight-style, the north celestial pole has a certain altitude, measured from the plane of the dial.

# '''Effective latitude''':If that dial-plane is horizontal, then it's a horizontal dial (bifilar, or straight-style). Then, of course the north celestial pole's altitude, measured from the dial-plane, is the latitude of the location. Well then, if the flat-dial is reclined, declined, or reclined-&amp;-declined, everything is the same as if it the dial were horizontal, with the celestial pole's altitude, measured with respect to the dial-plane, treated as the latitude.
# '''Dial-North''':Likewise, the north celestial pole's longitude, measured with respect to the plane of the dial, with respect to the downward direction (or the direction that a marble would roll, if the dial is reclining) on the dial-face, is the direction that is treated as north, when drawing the hour-lines. I'll call that direction "dial-north".
# '''Equatorial Longitude (hour-angle) of dial-north''':It's necessary to find the equatorial longitude of the dial-north direction (drawn on the dial). In the case of the horizontal dial, of course that's an hour-angle of zero, the south meridian. That determines what time ("dial-north time") is represented by the dial-north line. Other times, before and after that, can then have their lines drawn according to their differences from dial-north time--in the same way as they' be drawn on a horizontal dial-face according to their differences from 12 noon (true solar time).&lt;!--{{sfn|||p=}}--&gt;

[[File:Chopping block in China 01.jpg|thumb|A circular chopping block used in a restaurant in Haikou, Hainan, China]]
'''Butcher block''', '''butcher's block''' is a style of assembled [[wood]] (often [[hard maple]], [[teak]], or [[walnut]]) used as heavy duty chopping blocks, [[table (furniture)|table]] tops, and [[cutting board]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ovgMDZLba68C Old-House Journal]'' 09 1992, pg.38&lt;/ref&gt; It was commonly used in [[butcher shop]]s and meat processing plants but has now become popular in home use.&lt;ref name="bbdef"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mapleblock.com/detail/the-language-of-butcher-block-61/ |title=Butcher Block Terms |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902093259/http://www.mapleblock.com/detail/the-language-of-butcher-block-61/ |archivedate=September 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OEbb"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/butcher%27s%2Bblock | title=Oxford English Dictionary: butcher's block | accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic styles of butcher block: end grain and edge grain.&lt;ref name=bbdef /&gt;&lt;!-- It is contentious as to whether edge grain blocks (which certainly exist) are considered "butcher's block" or not. --&gt;

Butcher blocks have been used in butcher shops for centuries, and still are in many European countries.  Increasingly, though, butcher block is being used in domestic kitchens as an alternative to stone and laminate countertops.  This has created a new industry in the kitchen design arena and many furniture manufacturers and hardwood flooring companies are getting into the production of butcher blocks and butcher block countertops, in part because the countertops can be constructed from left-over wood that would otherwise be discarded.
== Basic care ==
Proper care of a butcher block is important for longevity of the material and, to a degree, food safety.
[[File:Black Walnut Workbench.jpg|thumb|right|A [[black walnut]] workbench in a bake lab]]
If the material is regularly exposed to water and not well cleaned, then [[mold]] can form.  The seams where the wood is joined can buckle as the wood expands and contracts.  Keeping the material well oiled allows it to maintain a rich color and its water repelling properties. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://icastle.com/articles/butcher-block-countertops | title=Butcher Block Countertops: 6 Pros and Cons | accessdate=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

To properly care for the butcher block any foreign material should first be removed, it can be disinfected with [[vinegar]] (or in extreme cases, [[bleach]]), allowed to dry well, and refreshed with [[mineral oil]] or other food safe [[sealant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.houzz.com/ideabooks/6653868/list/how-to-clean-and-care-for-your-butcher-block | title=How to Clean and Care for Your Butcher Block | accessdate=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CV-2000''' was one of the world's first home [[video tape recorder]]s (VTR), introduced by [[Sony]] in August, 1965.&lt;ref name="popular_mechanics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a2726/4255160/ |title=The 10 Video Formats HD DVD Will Meet in Heaven |accessdate=2008-03-25 |last=Derene |first=Glenn |date=2008-03-20 |publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'CV' in the model name stood for 'Consumer Video'. This was Sony's domestic format throughout the 1960s.&lt;ref name="LabGuy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labguysworld.com/Sony_CV-2000D.htm |title=Sony CV-2000D First Consumer Videocorder |accessdate=2008-03-27 |date=2005-01-09 |publisher=LabGuy's World }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/product/1960/cv-2000.html Sony.com History]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CV-2000 was developed by Sony engineer [[Nobutoshi Kihara]]. On its release, each machine cost US$695. It used {{convert|1/2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} [[video tape]] in a [[reel-to-reel]] format, meaning the tape had to be manually threaded around the [[helical scan]] video head drum. The CV-2000 was one-tenth the weight and price of other [[analog video]] recording products of its era.&lt;ref name="EETimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eetimes.com/special/special_issues/millennium/companies/sony.html |title=Sony: electronics ordered 'to go' |accessdate=2008-03-25 |last=Hara |first=Yoshiko |publisher=[[Electronic Engineering Times|EETimes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; It recorded television programs in [[Black-and-white|black and white]] using the [[skip field]] process, which produced a maximum 200-lines resolution. The tape moved at a speed of 7.5&amp;nbsp;inches per second.&lt;ref name="Retro_Thing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrothing.com/2005/11/the_sony_cv2000.html |title=The Sony CV-2000 Reel-to-Reel Video Recorder |accessdate=2008-03-27 |date=November 2005 |publisher=Retro Thing }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each reel of video tape cost US$40, and could hold one hour of video. Although CV-2000 was aimed at the home market, it was mainly used in business and educational institutions.&lt;ref name="popular_mechanics"/&gt;

Ten models were developed in the CV series: CV-2000, TCV-2010, TCV-2020, CV-2100, TCV-2110, TCV-2120, CV-2200, DV-2400, CV-2600 and CV-5100.&lt;ref name="LabGuy"/&gt; Sony also sold an optional 'Video Camera Ensemble', known as the VCK-2000. This add-on kit contained a separate video camera, a microphone, and a tripod.&lt;ref name="Retro_Thing"/&gt;

One of its shortcomings as a format was the omission of the ability to adjust [[Video tape tracking|tracking]], which made interchangeability of tapes between different machines almost impossible. Sony's later AV series machines included this feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smecc.org/sony_cv_series_video.htm smecc.org] Sony CV series video&lt;/ref&gt; The CV video recorders fell into disuse with the arrival of the [[EIAJ-1|EIAJ type 1]] standard that was used by many companies, including Sony with their AV series machines.

'''Cantera''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] chemical kinetics software used for solving chemically reacting laminar flows. It has been used as a third-party library in external reacting flow simulation codes, such as FUEGO and CADS, using [[Fortran]], [[C++]], etc. to evaluate properties and chemical source terms that appear in the application's governing equations. Cantera was originally written and developed by Prof. Dave Goodwin of [[California Institute of Technology]]. It is written in C++ and can be used from C++, [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Matlab]] and Fortran.

'''China Oilfield Services''' (COSL)  is an [[oil]]field services company. It is a majority owned subsidiary of Chinese state owned company [[CNOOC]] Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China Oilfield Considers Selling Shares in China |author=Wing-Gar Cheng |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=2006-12-19 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=aZfjWr4ywU9I&amp;refer=asia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has a listed sister company in Hong Kong, [[CNOOC Limited]].

China Oilfield Services usually purchases off shore vessels (OSVs) and operates them in [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] in off shore projects of CNOOC. It also operates in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and the [[Caspian Sea]].

==Overseas==
{{Unsourced|section|date= September 2018}}
COSL's overseas revenue surged 133% year on year in the first half of 2015 to 209.8 million yuan, driven by demand for its services in [[Indonesia]], [[West Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].

COSL had an office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia briefly in the early 2000s when it had its first western Vice President, Alan Good, a British born Oilman who helped launch the company internationally and pushed for further growth in the international sector.

COSL also maintains an office in Houston, TX as COSL America

==Stock==
{{Unsourced|section|date= September 2018}}
Globally, the number of listed players in the oilfield services sector is just over 100, with a combined [[market capitalisation]] of about US$250 billion. The top five account for 40% of the industry's market capitalisation. The two largest companies in this sector are [[Schlumberger]] with a 2007 year-end market cap of US$117.6 billion and [[Halliburton]] with a 2007-year end market cap of US$33.4 billion.

According to Mr Chen, US firms tend to be the most expensive with [[enterprise values]] running two to three times [[book value]]s, compared with one or less in Europe and Asia.

COSL claims a 95% share of China's market for [[offshore drilling]] services, 70% of the [[marine (ocean)|marine]] support and [[transportation]] market, 60% of the well survey services market and more than 50% of the seismic data collection market.

Globally, about 15% of oil companies' capital expenditure goes to exploration, 35% to field development and 50% to production.

COSL posted a 22.7% year-on-year rise in interim net profit to 555.9 million Yuan, ($115 million).


==Acquisitions==
On 23 September 2008, COSL acquired Norway's [[Awilco Offshore]] ASA (AWO) for 17.1 billion yuan (2.51 billion U.S. dollars), which is to be merged into '''COSL Drilling Europe AS''', a wholly owned subsidiary of COSL. The deal received backing from the relevant government departments of Norway and [[Statoil]], the state oil company of Norway. The deal increased the number of COSL's [[Drilling rig|operating rigs]] to 22 from 15 and created the world's eighth largest rig fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/23/content_10098328.htm news.xinhuanet.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Reaves Messina''' (born January 7, 1981) is the inventor of the [[hashtag]] as it is currently used on [[social media]] platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/fashion/hashtags-a-new-way-for-tweets-cultural-studies.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Twitter's Secret Handshake|author=Parker, Ashley|date=June 10, 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30340622|title=BBC News – Hashtag inventor: It was an 'accidental trip over a simple idea':|date=December 5, 2014|work=BBC|accessdate=2014-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/chris-messina-talks-about-inventing-the-hashtag-on-twitter-2013-11|title=The Inventor of the Twitter Hashtag Explains Why He Didn't Patent It|website=Business Insider|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 tweet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/223115412|title=🅲🅷🆁🅸🆂 🅼🅴🆂🆂🅸🅽🅰︎ on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messina proposed vertical/associational grouping of messages, trends, and events on Twitter by the means of hashtags. Simply put the hashtag was to be a type of [[Tag (metadata)|metadata tag]] that allowed users to apply dynamic, [[User-generated content|user-generated]] tagging which made it possible for others to easily find messages with a specific theme or content; it allowed easy, informal markup of [[folk taxonomy]] without need of any formal [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] or [[markup language]]. Hashtags have since been referred to as the "eavesdroppers", "wormholes", "time-machines", and "veins" of the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/decade-ago-hashtag-reshaped-internet-180964605/|title=A Decade Ago, the Hashtag Reshaped the Internet|last=Panko|first=Ben|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{quote|How do you feel about using # (pound) for groups.

Although Twitter's initial response to Messina's proposed use of hashtags was negative "these things are for nerds"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/decade-ago-hashtag-reshaped-internet-180964605/|title=A Decade Ago, the Hashtag Reshaped the Internet|last=Panko|first=Ben|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a series of events, including the devastating fire in San Diego County [[2007 California wildfires|later that year]], saw the first widespread use of #sandiegofire to allow users to easily track updates about the fire. The use of hashtags itself then eventually spread like wild-fire on Twitter, and by the end of the decade could be seen in most emerging as well as established social media platforms including Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube. So much so that Instagram had to officially place a "30 hashtags" limit on its posts to prevent people from abusing the use of hashtags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://help.instagram.com/351460621611097|title=How do I use hashtags? {{!}} Instagram Help Center|website=help.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A limit which [[Instagrammer|Instagrammers]] eventually circumvented by posting hashtags in the comments section of their posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itchban.com/blog/2017/1/7/instagram-max-hashtags-how-to-post-up-to-60|title=Instagram Max Hashtags: How to post up to 60|work=itchban|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018 more than 85% of the top 50 websites by traffic on the Internet use hashtags&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites|title=Website Ranking: Top Websites Rank In The World - SimilarWeb|website=www.similarweb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their use is highly common with millennials, Gen Z, politicians, influencers, and celebrities worldwide. 

Messina subsequently went on to become the Developer Experience Lead at [[Uber (company)|Uber]] from 2016 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/technology/2016/06/05/uber-app-urbanhail-startup-ride-prices|title=Uber denies access to Harvard startup that compared ride-hailing prices|date=June 5, 2016|website=Boston.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/computing/2014/summer/originstory.shtml|title=#OriginStory – Carnegie Mellon University {{!}} CMU|last=(CMU)|first=Carnegie Mellon University|website=www.cmu.edu|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as of 2018 ranks as the No. 1 hunter on [[Product Hunt|ProductHunt.com]]. He is a [[technology evangelist]] who is an advocate for [[Open-source model|open source]], [[open standards]], [[microformats]], and [[OAuth]]. Messina is also known for his involvement in helping to create the [[BarCamp]], [[Spread Firefox]], and [[coworking]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/technology/21iht-cowork.1.10263648.html|title=Coworking, a cooperative for the modern age|author=Fost, Dan|date=February 21, 2008|work=The International Herald Tribune|publisher=iht.com|accessdate=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
Messina was employed as an Open Source Advocate at [[Digital identity|identity]] company [[Vidoop]] and before that was the co-founder of marketing agency [[Citizen Agency]]. He worked at Google as an Open Web Advocate,&lt;ref name="Techcrunch"&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/07/chris-messina-google/ Happy Birthday, Chris Messina, And Enjoy Advocating The Open Web At Google]. TechCrunch (January 7, 2010).

From 2016 to January 2017, Messina lead the Developer Experience team at [[Uber (company)|Uber]] where he enforced the terms and conditions of Uber's proprietary APIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/chris-messina-hashtag-inventor-joins-uber-developer-experience-lead-google-2016-1?r=UK&amp;IR=T|title=The guy who invented the hashtag is joining Uber to build the 'future'|website=Business Insider|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/chris-messina/today-is-my-last-day-at-uber-f6d5b3c0548e#.njml8577u|title=Today is my last day at Uber|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Messina co-founded Citizen Agency, a company which describes itself as "Internet consultancy that specializes in developing community-centric strategies around product research, design, development and marketing"&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070613131452/http://www.citizenagency.com/ CitizenAgency.com]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Tara Hunt]] and [[Ben Metcalfe (Internet)|Ben Metcalfe]], who has since left the company.

Messina was an advocate of [[open-source software]], most notably [[Firefox]] and [[Flock browser|Flock]]. As a volunteer for the [[Spread Firefox]] campaign, he designed the 2004 Firefox advert which appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on December 16, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www-archive.mozilla.org/press/mozilla-2004-12-15.html |title=Mozilla Foundation Places Two-Page Advocacy Ad in The New York Times |publisher=mozilla.org |accessdate=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he won a [[Google-O'Reilly Open Source Award]] for Best Community Amplifier for [[BarCamp]], [[Microformats]] and Spread Firefox.&lt;ref name="Open Source Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/opensource/osa-hall-of-fame.html|title=Google-O'Reilly Open Source Awards – Hall of Fame |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Messina launched Molly, an AMA-style website where the questions are answered using the person's social media posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/02/19/hashtag-creator-launches-molly-to-build-a-personal-bot-from-your-social-media-footprint/|title=Hashtag creator launches Molly to make a personal bot from your social media footprint|last=Johnson|first=Khari|date=2018-02-19|work=[[VentureBeat]]|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inventing the Hashtag ==
{{quote|"I had no interest in making money (directly) off hashtags. They are born of the Internet, and should be owned by no one. The value and satisfaction I derive from seeing my funny little hack used as widely as it is today is valuable enough for me to be relieved that I had the foresight not to try to lock down this stupidly simple but effective idea."|Chris Messina. Explaining why he didn't patent the hashtag|source=https://www.quora.com/Twitter-Hashtags-1/Why-didnt-the-creator-of-the-hashtag-patent-the-concept/answer/Chris-Messina}}[[File:Animation occupywallstreet hashtag.gif|alt=Hashtag use can be seen in countless campaigns on the internet|thumb|440x440px|Social campaigns have begun to be titled in a hashtag form.]]The International Telecommunication Union approved in November 1988 a recommendation that put the hash sign on the right side of the 0 in the button arrangement for push buttons on telephones. This same arrangement is still used today in most software phones (see Android dialer for example). The ITU recommendation had 2 design options for the hash: a European version where the hash sign was built with a 90 degree angle and a North American version with an 80 degree angle. The North American version seems to have prevailed as most hash signs in Europe now follow the 80 degree inclination.
The pound sign was adopted for use within [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] networks circa 1988 to label groups and topics. Channels or topics that are available across an entire IRC network are prefixed with a hash symbol (as opposed to those local to a server, which use an [[ampersand]]).

The use of the pound sign in IRC inspired [[Chris Messina (open source advocate)|Chris Messina]] to propose a similar system to be used on Twitter to tag topics of interest on the microblogging network. He posted the first hashtag on Twitter. Messina’s suggestion to use the hashtag was not adopted by Twitter, but the practice took off after hashtags were widely used in tweets relating to the [[2007 California wildfires#San%20Diego%20County|2007 San Diego forest fires]] in Southern California. According to Messina, he suggested use of the hashtag to make it easy for "lay" users to search for content and find specific relevant updates; they were for people who do not have the technological knowledge to navigate the site. Therefore, the hashtag "was created organically by Twitter users as a way to categorize messages."  Today they are for anyone, either with or without technical knowledge, to easily impose enough annotation to be useful without needing a more formal system or adhering to many technical details.

Internationally, the hashtag became a practice of writing style for Twitter posts during the [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests]]; Twitter users inside and outside Iran used both English- and [[Persian language|Persian]]-language hashtags in communications during the events. The first published use of the term "hash tag" was in a blog post by Stowe Boyd, "Hash Tags = Twitter Groupings," on August 26, 2007, according to lexicographer [[Ben Zimmer]], chair of the [[American Dialect Society]]'s New Words Committee.
[[File:'freethenipple' hashtag.jpg|alt=Both the #MeToo and #FreeTheNipple movements use hashtags in their title|thumb|440x440px|Both the #MeToo and #FreeTheNipple movements use hashtags in their title]]
Beginning July 2, 2009, Twitter began to hyperlink all hashtags in tweets to Twitter search results for the hashtagged word (and for the standard spelling of commonly misspelled words). In 2010, Twitter introduced "[[Twitter#Trending%20topics|Trending Topics]]" on the Twitter front page, displaying hashtags that are rapidly becoming popular. Twitter has an algorithm to tackle attempts to [[Spamming|spam]] the trending list and ensure that hashtags trend naturally.

Although the hashtag started out most popularly on Twitter as the main social media platform for this use, the use has extended to other social media sites including Instagram, Facebook, Flickr, Tumblr, and Google+.

==Press==
Messina was featured with Hunt, also his ex-girlfriend, in "So Open it Hurts", in ''San Francisco Magazine'' (August 2008). The article detailed their very public and open relationship shared on the internet, and the lessons they derived from that experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/so-open-it-hurts |title=So open it hurts |publisher=modernluxury.com |accessdate=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conversion coatings''' are [[coating]]s for metals where the part‘s surface is subjected to a chemical or electro-chemical process by the coating material which converts it into a decorative or protective substance. Examples include [[chromate conversion coating]]s,  [[phosphate conversion coating]]s, [[Bluing (steel)|bluing]], [[black oxide]] coatings on steel, and [[anodizing]]. They are used for corrosion protection, to add decorative color and as paint primers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rit.edu/affiliate/nysp2i/sites/rit.edu.affiliate.nysp2i/files/pdfs/plating_or_conversion_coatings_final2e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://core.materials.ac.uk/repository/eaa/talat/5202.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electrochemsci.org/papers/vol3/3090993.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EPANET''' is a [[public domain]], [[water supply network|water distribution system]] modeling software package developed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) Water Supply and Water Resources Division. It performs extended-period simulation of hydraulic and water-quality behavior within pressurized pipe networks and is designed to be "a research tool that improves our understanding of the movement and fate of drinking-water constituents within distribution systems".&lt;ref&gt;Rossman, L. A., "Computer Models/EPANET" in L. Mays, ed., Water Distribution Systems Handbook, Chapter 12, McGraw-Hill companies, Inc., New York, NY, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; EPANET first appeared in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Rossman, L. A., "the EPANET Water Quality Model" in B. Coulbeck, ed., Integrated Computer Applications in Water Supply, Vol. 2, Research Studies Press Ltd., Somerset, England, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EPANET 2''' is available both as a standalone program and as an open-source toolkit ([[Application Programming Interface]] in [[C programming language|C]]). Its computational engine is used by many software companies that developed more powerful, proprietary packages, often [[GIS]]-centric. The EPANET ".inp" input file format,&lt;ref name=manual2000&gt;Rossman, L. A., "EPANET 2 Users Manual", 2000&lt;/ref&gt; which represents network topology, water consumption, and control rules, is supported by many free and commercial modeling packages. Therefore, it is arguably considered as the [[De facto standard|industry standard]].

==Features==
EPANET provides an integrated environment for editing network input data, running hydraulic and [[water quality]] simulations, and viewing the results in a variety of formats. EPANET provides a fully equipped and extended period of hydraulic analysis that can handle systems of any size. The package also supports the simulation of spatially and temporally varying water demand, constant or variable speed pumps, and the minor head losses for bends and fittings. The modeling provides information such as flows in pipes, pressures at junctions, propagation of a contaminant, chlorine concentration, water age, and even alternative scenario analysis. This helps to compute pumping energy and cost and then model various types of [[valve]]s, including shutoffs, check pressure regulating and [[flow control (data)|flow control]].

EPANET’s water quality modeling functionality allows users to analyze the movement of a reactive or non-reactive [[Flow tracer|tracer]] material which spreads through the network over time. It rates the reactive material as is grows, tracks the percentage of flow from the given nodes. The package employs the global reaction rate [[coefficient]] which can be modified on a pipe-by-pipe basis. The storage tanks can be modeled as complete mix, [[plug flow]] or two-compartment reactors.

The [[Visual networking|visual network editor]] of EPANET simplifies the process of building piping network models and editing their properties. These various types of [[data reporting]] visualization tools are used to assist to analyze the networks, which include the graphics views, tabular views, and special reports.

==Hydraulic simulation==

===Headloss in pipe segments===
EPANET hydraulics engine computes headlosses along the pipes by using one of the three formulas:
*[[Hazen–Williams equation|Hazen-Williams]] formula: used to model full flow conditions under simplified conditions (turbulent flow, temperature around 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and viscosity similar to water) http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/wswrd/dw/epanet.html
*[[Darcy-Weisbach friction factor|Darcy-Weisbach]] formula: used to model pressurized flow under a broader range of hydraulic conditions
*Chezy-Manning formula: used to model pressurized flow by using Chezy's roughness coefficients for Manning's equation
Since the pipe segment headloss equation is used within the network solver, the formula above is selected for the entire model.

===Head-flow Curves of Pumps===
Within EPANET, [[Centrifugal pump|pumps]] are modeled using a head-flow curve, which defines the relationship between hydraulic head imparted to the system by the pump and flow conveyed by the pump. The model calculates the flow conveyed by the pump element for a given system head condition based on this curve. EPANET can also model a pump as a constant power input, effectively adding a given amount of energy to the system downstream of the pump element.&lt;ref name=manual2000 /&gt;

===Network solver===
The network hydraulics solver employed by EPANET uses the "Gradient Method" first proposed by Todini and Pilati,&lt;ref&gt;Todini E. &amp; Pilati S. 1988. A gradient algorithm for the analysis of pipe networks. In B. Coulbeck and C.H. Orr (eds) Computer Applications in Water Supply, Volume 1 (System analysis and simulation), John Wiley &amp; Sons, London, pp. 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a variant of [[Newton-Raphson]] method.

==Water-quality simulation==
EPANET includes the capability to model water age and predict flow of non-reactive and, under simplified conditions, reactive materials.&lt;ref name=manual2000 /&gt; This capability is frequently used to predict chlorine residuals within water distribution systems. While the internal water quality simulation capabilities only evaluates decay or growth of a single constituent, an extension is available (EPANET-MSX), which allows modeling of interactions between constituents.

==EPANET Toolkit==
EPANET's computational engine is available for download as a separate [[Dynamic-link library|dynamic link library]] for incorporation into other applications.&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency [http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/wswrd/dw/epanet.html "Programmer's Toolkit"], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], Updated 5 January 2012. Retrieved on 21 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The source code for EPANET 2 is available on the EPA's EPANET website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/wswrd/dw/epanet.html#downloads&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the EPANET toolkit, written in C, was rewritten in Java in a more [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] style. The code in Java is available on Github: https://github.com/Baseform/Baseform-Epanet-Java-Library.

==Compatibility==
EPANET uses a binary file format, but also includes the capability for importing and exporting data in [[AutoCAD DXF|dxf]], metafile, and ASCII file formats. EPANET's ASCII file format is called an input file within EPANET, and uses a file extension ".inp".&lt;ref name=manual2000 /&gt; The input file can include data describing network topology, water consumption, and control rules, and is supported by many free and commercial modeling packages.

While EPANET is used as the computational engine for most water distribution system models, most models are developed and maintained in hydraulic modeling packages based on EPANET's computational engine. Some of the major hydraulic modeling packages are:

It was invented at the beginning of the 20th century by the German [[:de:Willy Abel|Willy Abel]] (1875-1951) who also invented the bread cutter. The first egg slicers were produced in [[Berlin-Lichtenberg]].&lt;ref name="Berliner Zeitung"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/heimatmuseum-zeigt-mehr-als-hundert-jahre-lichtenberger-industriegeschichte-der-eierschneider-war-ein-welterfolg,10810590,9266810.html | title=The Egg Slicer was a World-Wide Success (in German)| date=April 23, 1997 | accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch comedic duo [[Van Kooten en De Bie|Van Kooten en de Bie]] created a mock documentary about a Dutch egg slicer factory in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Het officiële Koot&amp;Bie-kanaal|title=De Eiersnijder - Van Kooten en De Bie|date=2017-11-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6ybHWcdmW4|accessdate=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Epergne, Thomas Pitts I, London, 1761 - Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art - DSC08880.JPG |thumb|right|Sterling epergne]]

'''Epergne''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|p|ɜːr|n|}} or {{IPAc-en|eɪ|ˈ|p|ɛər|n}}) is a type of table [[centerpiece]], usually made of [[silver]], but may be made of any metal or glass or porcelain.

==Design==
An epergne generally has a large central "bowl" or basket sitting on three to five feet.  From this center "bowl" radiate branches supporting small baskets, dishes, or [[candleholder]]s.&lt;ref name="athome"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bryson |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Bryson |title=[[At Home: A Short History of Private Life]] |year=2010 |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-7679-1938-8 |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be between two and seven branches. Epergnes were traditionally made from silver, however from around the start of the 20th century, glass was also employed.

==Use==
An epergne may be used to hold any type of food or dessert. It may also be used as a designer object to hold candles, flowers or ornaments for a holiday etc. 

In traditional use, an epergne is a fancy way to display side dishes, fruit, or sweetmeats, or can be used for chips, dips, or other finger foods etc.

==Name==
The [[wikt:derivation|derivation]] is probably from the [[French language|French]] ''épargne'' meaning "saving," the idea being that dinner guests were saved the trouble of passing dishes (although an epergne in French is called a ''surtout''). In addition the word ''épergne'' in French can also mean "spare", another way of saying "to save", or a spare, meaning "reserve or extra".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6323">{{Antennas|components}}

In a radio [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], the '''feed line''' ('''feedline'''), or '''feeder''', is the cable or other [[transmission line]] that connects the antenna with the radio [[transmitter]] or [[Radio receiver|receiver]].   In a transmitting antenna, it feeds the [[radio frequency]] (RF) [[electric current|current]] from the transmitter to the antenna, where it is radiated as [[radio wave]]s.  In a receiving antenna it transfers the tiny RF voltage induced in the antenna by the radio wave to the receiver.  In order to carry RF current efficiently, feed lines are made of specialized types of cable called [[transmission line]].    The most widely used types of feed line are [[coaxial cable]], [[twin-lead]], [[ladder line]], and at [[microwave]] frequencies, [[waveguide]].

Particularly with a transmitting antenna, the feed line is a critical component that must be adjusted to work correctly with the antenna and transmitter.  Each type of transmission line has a specific [[characteristic impedance]].  This must be matched to the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the antenna and the transmitter, to transfer power efficiently to the antenna.  If these impedances are not matched it can cause a condition called [[standing wave]]s on the feed line, in which the RF energy is reflected back toward the transmitter, wasting energy and possibly overheating the transmitter.  This adjustment is done with a device called an [[antenna tuner]] in the transmitter, and sometimes a [[matching network]] at the antenna.  The degree of mismatch between the feedline and the antenna is measured by an instrument called an [[SWR meter]] (standing wave ratio meter), which measures the ''[[standing wave ratio]]'' (SWR) on the line.  

==Twin-lead==
{{Main|Twin-lead}}
Twin lead is used to connect [[FM radio]]s and [[television receiver]]s with their antennas, although it has been largely replaced in the latter application by coaxial cable, and as a feedline for low power transmitters such as [[amateur radio]] transmitters.  It consists of two wire [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] running parallel to each other with a precisely constant spacing, molded in [[polyethylene]] [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] material in a flat ribbon-like cable.  The distance between the two wires is small relative to the [[wavelength]] of the RF signal carried on the wire.  Furthermore, the RF [[Electric current|current]] in one wire is equal in [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and opposite in [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] to the RF current on the other wire (it is inverted).  Thus, if both wires [[Radiation|radiate]] energy equally, the radiated energies will cancel each other out and there will be near zero radiation at any distance from the wire. Twin lead is also immune to external noise or RF energies.  Any unwanted external noise or unwanted RF energy induced on the wire from external energy sources will be induced in both wires at the same time and equally in magnitude and direction.  At the end of the transmission line the inverted signal wire is restored to normal (non-inverted now) and added back to the original non-inverted signal wire by the receiving circuitry.  Any noise will now be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction and cancel itself out.  

Twin lead is considered a [[Balanced line]].

==Coaxial cable==
[[File:Antenne gp vhf 2.jpg|thumb|Coaxial cable feedline emerging from a VHF [[ground plane antenna]]. ]]
{{Main|Coaxial cable}}

Coaxial cable is probably the most widely used type of feedline, used for frequencies below the [[microwave]] ([[Superhigh frequency|SHF]]) range.    It consists of a wire center conductor and a braided or solid metallic "shield" conductor, usually [[copper]] or [[aluminum]] surrounding it.    The center conductor is separated from the  outer shield by a [[dielectric]], usually plastic foam, to keep the separation between the two conductors precisely constant.  The shield is covered with an outer plastic insulation jacket.  In ''hard coax'' cable, used for high power transmitting applications like [[television transmitter]]s, the shield is a rigid or flexible metal pipe containing a compressed gas such as [[nitrogen]], and the internal conductor is held centered with periodic plastic spacers.  It is a type of [[unbalanced line]], the shield conductor is usually connected to electrical [[ground (electricity)|ground]].  Coaxial cable's advantage is that the enclosing shield conductor isolates the cable from external electromagnetic fields, so it is very immune to interference.
{{breakafterimages}}

==Waveguide==
[[File:Radar antenna feed waveguide.png|thumb|Complicated waveguide feed of a military radar]]
{{Main|Waveguide}}

[[Waveguide]] is used at [[microwave]] ([[Superhigh frequency|SHF]]) frequencies, at which other types of feedline have excessive power losses.  A waveguide is a hollow metallic conductor or pipe.  It can have a circular or square cross-section.  Waveguide runs are often pressurized with nitrogen gas to keep moisure out. The [[RF signal]] travels through the pipe similarly to the way sound travels in a tube. The metal walls keep it from radiating energy outwards and also prevent interference from entering the waveguide.  Because of the cost and maintenance waveguide entails, microwave antennas often have the output stage of the transmitter or the [[RF front end]] of the receiver located at the antenna, and the signal is fed to or from the rest of the transmitter or receiver at a lower frequency, using coaxial cable. 

A waveguide is considered an unbalanced [[transmission line]].

This is a comparison of a few common feed line characteristics.

A '''Hiboy''' is a specialized, high-clearance type of farm [[tractor]] designed to operate in high crops without damaging them.  The largest producer of hiboys is [[Hagie Manufacturing|Hagie Manufacturing Company]] of [[Clarion, Iowa]], United States.  The most common uses of hiboys are for [[detasseling]], spraying herbicides, and applying [[glyphosate]] directly to weeds growing above crop height with a wick or wiper.

National Bureau of Standards (NBS) mathematician and computer expert Ida Rhodes demonstrates her pioneering work in computer translation of languages.

'''Ida Rhodes''' (born '''Hadassah Itzkowitz'''; May 15, 1900 – February 1, 1986&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) was an American [[mathematician]] who became a member of the [[clique]] of influential women at the heart of early [[computer]] development in the [[United States]].

==Childhood==
Hadassah Itzkowitz was born in a Jewish village between [[Nemyriv]] and [[Tulchyn]] in the [[Ukraine]]. She was 13 years old in 1913 when her parents, David and Bessie Sinkler Itzkowitz, brought her to the United States (her name was changed upon entering the U.S.)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u7nqH3RzUusC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=ida+rhodes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GouZxj_XId&amp;sig=wWcLV04OxRVzuLayvU7i7sYHOts&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt_rTJwu_RAhUS72MKHSO4BvQQ6AEIUTAN#v=onepage&amp;q=ida%20rhodes&amp;f=false|title=Notable Women in Mathematics: A Biographical Dictionary|last=Morrow|first=Charlene|last2=Perl|first2=Teri|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780313291319|location=|pages=180|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Rhodes was awarded the New York State Cash Scholarship and a [[Cornell University]] Scholarship&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; and began studying [[mathematics]] at [[Cornell University]] only six years after coming to the United States, from 1919-1923.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; During her time at Cornell University she worked as a nurse's aid at [[Ithaca City Hospital]]. She was elected to the honorary organizations [[Phi Beta Kappa]] (1922) and [[Phi Kappa Phi]] (1923).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
She received her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in mathematics in February, 1923 and her [[Master's degree|MA]] in September of the same year, graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]].

Rhodes had her first encounter with Albert Einstein in 1922 and in 1936 encountered him again in 1936 at Princeton, where a group of mathematicians traveled to spend the weekend in informal seminars. 
She later studied at [[Columbia University]] in 1930-31. She held numerous positions involving mathematical computations before she joined the [[Mathematical Tables Project]] in 1940, where she worked under [[Gertrude Blanch]], whom she would later credit as her mentor.

Ida Rhodes was a pioneer in the analysis of systems of [[Computer programming|programming]], and with [[Betty Holberton]] designed the [[C-10 programming language]] in the early 1950s for the [[UNIVAC I]]. She also designed the original computer used for the [[Social Security Administration]]. In 1949, the [[Department of Commerce]] awarded her a Gold Medal for "significant pioneering leadership and outstanding contributions to the scientific progress of the Nation in the functional design and the application of electronic digital computing equipment".

Though she retired in 1964, Rhodes continued to consult for the Applied Mathematics Division of the [[National Bureau of Standards]] until 1971. Her work became much more widely known after her retirement, as she took the occasion to travel around the globe, lecturing and maintaining international correspondence. In 1976, the Department of Commerce presented her with a further Certificate of Appreciation on the 25th Anniversary of UNIVAC I, and then at the 1981 Computer Conference cited her a third time as a "UNIVAC I pioneer." She died in 1986.

In an unusual case of an old specialized algorithm still in use, and still credited to the original developer, Rhodes was responsible for the "Jewish Holiday" algorithm used in calendar programs to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rapp|first1=Katie|title=Ida Rhodes and the Problem with ‘Water Goats’|url=https://www.nist.gov/blogs/taking-measure/ida-rhodes-and-problem-water-goats|website=Taking Measure|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhodes|first1=Ida|title=Computation of the dates of the Hebrew New Year and Passover|journal=Computers and Mathematics with Applications|date=1977|volume=3|issue=3|pages=183–190|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122177900931|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the National Bureau of Standards (now [http://www.nist.gov NIST]), she also did original work in machine translation of natural languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhodes|first1=Ida|last2=Alt|first2=Franz L.|title=Hindsight technique in machine translation of natural languages|journal=Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards|date=1962|volume=66B|issue=2|pages=47–51|url=https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/66B/jresv66Bn2p47_A1b.pdf|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhodes|first1=Ida|title=Syntactic integration carried out mechanically|journal=Information Storage and Retrieval|date=1963|volume=1|issue=4|pages=215–219|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0020027163900184|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Integrated Sensor is Structure''' ('''ISIS''') was a program managed by the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[United States Air Force Research Laboratory|Research Laboratory]] to research the feasibility of using an unmanned [[airship]] as a high-altitude [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[Surveillance#Aerial|surveillance]] platform. It is sometimes called '''Integrated Sensor is the Structure''', as a fundamental innovation was the use of the airship structure as the sensing component of a state-of-the-art [[radar]] system.

In 2006, contracts were awarded to [[Raytheon]] for development of a large-area, light, [[Active electronically scanned array]] antenna which could be bonded to the structure of a blimp,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 8 August 2006 | url = http://investor.raytheon.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=84193&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=893481 | title = DARPA Asks Raytheon to Develop Radar for 'Integrated Sensor Is Structure' Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northrop Grumman]] for antenna development, and [[Lockheed Martin]] for development of the airship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Singer | first = Jeremy | date = August 9, 2006 | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14275624/ | title = Pentagon’s airship plans are up in the air | format = | work = [[MSNBC]] | accessdate = 16 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As proposed, the {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=on}}-long surveillance airship could be launched from the US and stationed for up to 10 years at an altitude of {{convert|65000|ft|m}}, observing the movement of vehicles, aircraft, and people below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ISIS on Station|url=http://www.codeonemagazine.com/images/C1_Vol24_No3_new_1271449318_8621.pdf|accessdate=19 July 2017|work=Code One Magazine|issue=24 (3)|publisher=Lockheed Martin|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that altitude, the airship would be beyond the range of most surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles. The airship would be filled with [[helium]] and powered, at least in part, by solar-powered hydrogen fuel cells.

On March 12, 2009, the USAF announced that it had budgeted $400 million for work on ISIS .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Barnes | first = Julian E. | date = March 13, 2009

The model blimp was to have radar coverage of about 7,176 square yards (6,000 square meters) and be tested at an altitude of {{convert|6|mi|km}} above the ground. The contract initially awarded $100 million to the two companies, with the rest to follow in phases, with a completion date of March 2013.&lt;ref name=Ratnam/&gt;

As of 2012, the development of the airframe had been delayed to focus on "radar risk reduction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warwick|first1=Graham|title=Airship Programs – Not So Buoyant, Says GAO|url=http://aviationweek.com/blog/airship-programs-not-so-buoyant-says-gao|accessdate=19 July 2017|work=Aviation Week Network|date=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Defense]] ended the program in 2015. $471 million had been spent from 2007 through 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=d’Oliveira|first1=Flavio Araripe|last2=de Melo|first2=Francisco Cristovão Lourenço|last3=Devezas|first3=Tessaleno Campos|title=High-Altitude Platforms — Present Situation and Technology Trends|journal=Journal of Aerospace Technology and Management|date=July 2016|volume=8|issue=3|page=254|doi=10.5028/jatm.v8i3.699 |url=http://www.redalyc.org/html/3094/309446752001/|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Introduction to Outer Space''''' is a pamphlet about [[space exploration]] edited by the [[White House]] the 26 March 1958.  At first, a report of the [[President's Science Advisory Committee]] presided by Dr [[James R. Killian]] in the aftermath of the [[Sputnik 1]] launch, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] found it so informative and interesting that he decided to make it available to everybody for 15 cents.   It presents in simple terms to the layman the future of [[space exploration]].

It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;Dwaybe A. Day, "[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/506/1 Boldly going: Star Trek and spaceflight]", in ''The Space Review'', 28 November 2005. URL accessed on 15 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; that the ''Introduction to Outer Space'', produced in an effort to garner support for a [[NASA|national space program]] in the wake of the [[Sputnik program|Sputnik]] flight, was the origin of the phrase "[[Where no man has gone before]]", as the booklet read on its first page:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first of these factors is the compelling urge of man to explore and to discover, the thrust of curiosity that leads men to try to go where no one has gone before. Most of the surface of the earth has now been explored and men now turn on the exploration of outer space as their next objective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/spp/guide/usa/intro1958.html "Introduction to Outer Space"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8964">A '''building joint''' is a junction where [[building]] elements meet without applying a static load from one element to another. When one or more of these vertical or horizontal elements that meet are required by the local [[building code]] to have a [[fire-resistance rating]], the resulting opening that makes up the joint must be [[firestop]]ped in order to restore the required [[Compartmentalization (fire protection)|compartmentalisation]].

Such joints are often subject to movement, as a function of the building's design basis. For a sample [[certification listing]] indicating [[fire test]]ed [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20081010142218/http://www.trakloc.com/drawings/Deflection-CEJ%20481%20H%20-%20Trakloc.pdf click here.] [[Firestop]]s must be able to demonstrate the ability to withstand operational movement prior to [[fire test]]ing. Firestops for such building joints can be qualified to [https://web.archive.org/web/20100405085109/http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=2079.html UL 2079 -- Tests for Fire Resistance of Building Joint Systems].

Whether or not the building elements forming the joint have a fire-resistance rating, the joint design must still consider the anticipated operational movement of each joint. Timing is also important, as freshly poured concrete shrinks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cement.ca/cement.nsf/0/2A4A1D82ADCA0FCE852568AB00111731?OpenDocument|title=Cement Association of Canada - Drying Shrinkage|publisher=Cement Association of Canada|accessdate=2008-05-05|last=|first=}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly during the first few months of a new building, potentially causing joint size changes.

==Perimeter slab edge==

Firestopping at the "perimeter slab edge", which is gaps between the floors and the backpan of the [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] or precast concrete panels, slow the passage of fire and combustion gases between floors. The firestop at the perimeter slab edge is considered a continuation of the fire-resistance rating of the floor slab. The curtain wall itself, however, is not ordinarily required to have a rating. Fire [[passive fire protection|compartmentalisation]] is based upon compartments enclosed on all sides to avoid fire and smoke migration beyond each engaged compartment. A non-fire-resistance rated curtain wall prevents the complete compartment (or envelope) from being fire-resistance rated. The provision of firestopping at the joint of the floor slab and curtain wall can still add to the overall fire safety of the building by slowing the advance of the fire in the building interior from floor to floor. The use of fire sprinklers has been shown to mitigate the spread of fire by keeping the fire from growing to a size large enough to cause structural damage and break the exterior glass. If the building is not equipped with sprinklers, the fire can travel up the outside of the curtain wall if the glass on the floor of fire origin is shattered due to radiant heat, causing flames to lick up the outside of the building, resulting in the glass in floors above to break. Falling glass can endanger pedestrians, firefighters and firehoses below. An example of mode of fire spread is the First Interstate Bank Fire in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lafire.com/famous_fires/880504_1stInterstateFire/exsummary/LAFD-ExecutiveSummary.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807161346/http://www.lafire.com/famous_fires/880504_1stInterstateFire/exsummary/LAFD-ExecutiveSummary.htm |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }} Los Angeles Fire Department

==Head-of-Wall (HOW)==
Where fire-resistance rated wall assemblies, be they [[masonry]] or [[drywall]], meet the underside of the floor slab above, a movement joint results, which can be subject to compression, as the freshly placed [[concrete]] cures and shrinks all over a new building. This joint must be firestopped in a flexible manner. For [[Concrete masonry unit|concrete block]] walls that are not load-bearing, the contractor is often instructed to stop the wall about 25mm short of the slab above. The drywaller has to fasten a track to the underside of the slab above, which holds the metal studs. The drywall is then either stopped short allowing for a flexible buffer to be inserted or caulked in place, or one may use purpose-made tracks that hold the studs but permit vertical movement without damage to the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2210">'''Laydown delivery''' is a mode of attack using a freefall [[nuclear weapon]]: the bomb's descent to the target is slowed by ribbon [[parachute]] so that it actually lands on the ground before [[detonation|detonating]].&lt;ref&gt;William Potter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dAunDfJnzx4C&amp;pg=PA69 "Tactical Nuclear Weapons: Options for Control"], Volume 19, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Laydown delivery requires the weapon's case to be reinforced so that it can survive the force of impact and generally involves a time-delay [[fuze]] to trigger [[detonation]] e.g. 45 seconds after hitting the ground. Laydown mode can be used to increase the effect of the weapon's blast on built-up targets such as [[submarine pen]]s or to transmit a [[shock wave]] through the ground to attack deeply-buried targets. An attack of this type produces large amounts of [[radioactive fallout]].

It has the additional advantage of allowing the carrier aircraft to fly very low and still escape from ground zero without being damaged or destroyed by effects of the nuclear explosion. That is particularly important for high-yield nuclear weapons such as the [[B83_nuclear_bomb|B83]] and [[B53 nuclear bomb]]s. Low-altitude delivery also helps hide the aircraft from [[surface-to-air missile]]s. It was for that reason that laydown was selected for the [[Vickers Valiant]] bomber of the [[Royal Air Force]], as the design became increasingly vulnerable to Soviet weapons, especially the [[S-75 Dvina|SA-2 missile]]. The low-level laydown delivery was referred to as "Equipment 2 Foxtrot" in RAF parlance; alternatives included "2 Echo" [[toss bombing]] and "2 Hotel", a particular climbing delivery method used by the [[Avro Vulcan]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristan Stoddart, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a3uKiTYlSugC&amp;pg=PA105 "Losing an Empire and Finding a Role"], Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, pp. 104–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lead azide ''' ([[lead|Pb]]([[nitrogen|N]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an [[inorganic compound]].  More so than other [[azide]]s, {{chem|Pb|(|N|3|)|2}} is explosive.  It is used in [[detonator]]s to initiate [[secondary explosive]]s.  In a commercially usable form, it is a white to [[Buff (colour)|buff]] powder.

==Preparation and handling==
Lead azide is prepared by [[metathesis (chemistry)|metathesis]] between [[sodium azide]] and [[Lead(II) nitrate|lead nitrate]]. [[Dextrin]] can be added to the solution to stabilize the precipitated product.  The solid is not very [[hygroscopic]], and water does not reduce its impact sensitivity. It is normally shipped in a dextrinated solution that lowers its sensitivity. When protected from humidity, it is completely stable in storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fedoroff |first= Basil T. |author2=Henry A. Aaronson |author3=Earl F. Reese |author4=Oliver E. Sheffield |author5=George D. Clift  |title= Encyclopedia of Explosives and Related Items (Vol. 1) |publisher= US Army Research and Development Command TACOM, ARDEC |year= 1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative method involves dissolving lead acetate in a sodium azide solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdasyn.org/synfiles/bleiazid.htm|title=λ » LambdaSyn  – Synthese von Bleiazid|website=www.lambdasyn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Verneker | first1 = V.

==Production history==
Lead azide in its pure form was first prepared by [[Theodor Curtius]] in 1891. Due to sensitivity and stability concerns, the dextrinated form of lead azide (MIL-L-3055) was developed in the 1920s and 1930s with large scale production by DuPont Co beginning in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Energetic Materials, Technology of the Inorganic Azides |volume=2 |publisher=Plenum Press |year=1977 |last1=Fair |first1=Harry David |last2=Walker |first2=Raymond F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detonator development during World War II resulted in the need for a form of lead azide with a more [[brisance|brisant]] output. RD-1333 lead azide (MIL-DTL-46225), a version of lead azide with sodium [[Carboxymethyl cellulose|carboxymethylcellulose]] as a precipitating agent, was developed to meet that need. The Vietnam War saw an accelerated need for lead azide and it was during this time that Special Purpose Lead Azide  (MIL-L-14758) was developed; the US government also began stockpiling lead azide in large quantities. After the Vietnam War, the use of lead azide dramatically decreased.  Due to the size of the US stockpile, the manufacture of lead azide in the US ceased completely by the early 1990s. In the 2000s, concerns about the age and stability of stockpiled lead azide led the US government to investigate methods to dispose of its stockpiled lead azide and obtain new manufacturers.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

==Explosive characteristics==
Lead azide is highly sensitive and usually handled and stored under water in insulated rubber containers. It will explode after a fall of around 150&amp;nbsp;mm (6&amp;nbsp;in) or in the presence of a static discharge of 7 millijoules. Its [[Explosive velocity|detonation velocity]] is around {{convert|5180|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

[[Ammonium acetate]] and [[sodium dichromate]] are used to destroy small quantities of lead azide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tpub.com/gunners/7.htm|title=Primary (Initiating) Explosives|website=www.tpub.com|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=October 2016}}

Lead azide has immediate deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) this means that even small amounts undergo full detonation(after being hit by flame or static electricity).

Lead [[azide]] reacts with [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], or alloys containing these metals to form other azides. For example, [[copper azide]] is even more explosive and too sensitive to be used commercially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lazari|first=Gerasimi|last2=Stamatatos|first2=Theocharis C.|last3=Raptopoulou|first3=Catherine P.|last4=Psycharis|first4=Vassilis|last5=Pissas|first5=Michael|last6=Perlepes|first6=Spyros P.|last7=Boudalis|first7=Athanassios K.|date=2009-04-13|title=A metamagnetic 2D copper(II)-azide complex with 1D ferromagnetism and a hysteretic spin-flop transition|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2009/DT/b823423j#!divAbstract|journal=Dalton Transactions|language=en|issue=17|doi=10.1039/B823423J|issn=1477-9234}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=October 2016}}

Lead azide was a component of the six .22 caliber Devastator rounds fired from a [[Röhm RG-14]] revolver by [[John Hinckley, Jr.]] in his assassination attempt on U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] on March 30, 1981. The rounds consisted of lead azide centers with lacquer-sealed aluminum tips designed to explode upon impact.&lt;ref&gt;The Exploding Bullets, by Pete Barley and Charles Babcock, Washington Post, 4 Apr, 1981. Retrieved 28 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linux adoption''' is the [[Adoption (software implementation)|adoption]] of [[Linux]] computer [[operating system]]s (OS) by households, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and governments.

Many factors have resulted in the expanded use of Linux systems by traditional desktop users as well as operators of server systems, including the desire to minimize software costs, increase [[network security]] and support for [[open source|open-source]] philosophical principles.&lt;ref name="Cornet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whylinuxisbetter.net/ |title=Why Linux is Better |accessdate=15 March 2009 |last=Cornet |first=Manu |year=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years several governments, at various levels, have enacted policies shifting state-owned computers to Linux from [[proprietary software]] regimes.

In August 2010, Jeffrey Hammond, principal analyst at [[Forrester Research]], declared, "Linux has crossed the chasm to mainstream adoption," a statement attested by the large number of enterprises that had transitioned to Linux during the [[late-2000s recession]]. In a company survey completed in the third quarter of 2009, 48% of surveyed companies reported using an open-source operating system.&lt;ref name="Kerner12Aug10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3898206/LinuxCon-Analysts-Linux-Is-Winning.htm |title=LinuxCon Analysts: Linux Is Winning |accessdate=12 August 2010 |last=Kerner |first=Sean Michael |date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Linux Foundation]] regularly releases publications regarding the [[Linux kernel]], Linux OS [[Linux distribution|distributions]], and related themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications |title=Publications of the Linux Foundation |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such publication, "Linux Adoption Trends: A Survey of Enterprise End Users," is freely available upon registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/linux-foundation/linux-adoption-trends-end-user-survey |title=Linux Adoption Trends: A Survey of Enterprise End Users |accessdate=2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the term Linux adoption, refers to adoption of a Linux OS made for "desktop" computers, the original intended use (or adoption on servers, that is essentially the same form of OS). Adoption of that form on personal computers is still low relatively, while adoption of the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system is very high. The term Linux adoption, often overlooks that operating system&lt;!-- the talk of desktop Linux adoption predates Android.. (possibly Android will get popular soon on desktops/laptops, while maybe not (at first..) more popular than Windows.. would quickly be more popular than traditional desktop Linux.. --&gt; or other uses such as in [[Chrome OS]]&lt;!--must be by now, most popular "desktop" "Linux", by far--&gt; that also use the [[Linux kernel]] (but have almost nothing else in common, not even the name – Linux – usually applied; while Android is the most popular variant – in fact the most popular operating system in the world).

==Linux adopters==
{{Main article|List of Linux adopters}}
Outside of traditional web services, Linux powers many of the biggest Internet properties (e.g., [[Google]],&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Corbet, [https://lwn.net/Articles/357658/ "KS2009: How Google uses Linux"], ''LWN.net'', 21 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amazon.com|Amazon]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Shankland, [http://www.cnet.com/news/how-linux-saved-amazon-millions "How Linux saved Amazon millions"], ''CNET'', 7 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook]], [[eBay]], [[Twitter]] or [[Yahoo!]]&lt;ref&gt;Steven J.

Linux is used on desktop computers, servers and supercomputers, as well as a wide range of devices.

[[File:Ubuntu 11.04 Installation SS.png|thumb|Installation screen of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], a popular distribution of Linux.]]

===={{anchor|DESKTOP}}Measuring desktop adoption====
Because Linux desktop distributions are not usually distributed by retail sale, there are no sales numbers that indicate the number of users. One downloaded file may be used to create many CDs and each CD may be used to install the operating system on multiple computers. On the other hand, the file might be used only for a test and the installation erased soon after. Due to these factors estimates of current Linux desktop often rely on webpage hits by computers identifying themselves as running Linux.

{{As of|2017|2}}, ''W3Counter'' estimated "Linux" web browser market share to be 4.63%, while "Android" versions 6, 5 and 4 combined (which is based on the [[Linux kernel]]) were estimated to be 33.77%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php?year=2017&amp;month=2|title = Global Web Stats|accessdate = 3 March 2015|website = W3Counter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Linux Counter'' uses an alternate method of estimating adoption, asking users to register and then using a mathematical model to estimate the total number of desktop users. In November 2014 this method estimated 73 million Linux users.&lt;ref name="LinuxCounter2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LinuxCounter"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://counter.li.org/|title = The Linux Counter|accessdate =18 March 2009|last = Linux Counter|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014 [[Pornhub]] released usage statistics of their website and reported 1.7% Linux users.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTc3NDk OS Battle: Linux Takes 1.7% Desktop Marketshare] on [[Phoronix]] by [[Michael Larabel]] (28 August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] [[game engine]] gathers user statistics and showed in March 2016 0.4% Linux users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hwstats.unity3d.com/pc/os.html Platforms Top on 2016-03] ''Windows Player: 97.3%, OS X Player: 2.3%, Others (click to show): 0.4% Linux Player: 0.4%''&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] client tracks usage and reported in May 2015 around 1% Linux users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/140901-Linux-Steam-Users-Under-1 Linux Users Drop to Under 1% In Latest Steam Survey] by Steven Bogos on the [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] (26 May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, [[Aaron Seigo]] of [[KDE]] indicated that most web-page counter methods produce Linux adoption numbers that are far too low given the system's extensive penetration into non-North American markets, especially China. He stated that the North American-based web-measurement methods produce high Windows numbers and ignore the widespread use of Linux in other parts of the world. In estimating true worldwide desktop adoption and accounting for the Windows-distorted environment in the USA and Canada he indicated that at least 8% of the world desktops run Linux distributions and possibly as high as 10–12% and that the numbers are rising quickly. Other commentators have echoed this same belief, noting that competitors are expending a lot of effort to discredit Linux, which is incongruent with a tiny market share:&lt;ref name="Byfield04May09"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/12068_3818696_2/Linux-Desktop-Market-Share-Greater-Than-One-Percent.htm|title = Linux Desktop Market Share: Greater Than One Percent? |accessdate =6 May 2009|last = Byfield|first = Bruce|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schroder28May09"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.linuxtoday.com/blog/2009/05/1-linux-microso.html |title = Tiny 1% Linux = Big Microsoft Terror |accessdate =30 May 2009|last = Schroder|first = Carla|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I don't believe that the desktop Linux market share is barely 1%. I think it is a lot higher. I have no good data to share; I base my assessment on experience and knowing the industry. There is something else that is even more persuasive, and that is how Microsoft behaves. If Linux is so insignificant, why do they pay so much attention to it?|Carla Schroder, Linux Today&lt;ref name="Schroder28May09" /&gt;}}

In May 2009, Preston Gralla, contributing editor to [[Computerworld]].com, in reacting to the Net Applications web hit numbers showing that Linux use was over 1%, said that "Linux will never become an important desktop or notebook operating system". He reasoned that the upsurge in Linux desktop use recently seen was due to Linux netbooks, a trend he saw as already diminishing and which would be further eroded when [[Windows 7]] became available (and indeed, Linux netbooks did fall by the wayside, though whether they were solely responsible for the upsurge in Linux usage is open to question). He concluded: "As a desktop operating system, Linux isn't important enough to think about. For servers, it's top-notch, but you likely won't use it on your desktop – even though it did finally manage to crack the 1% barrier after 18 years".&lt;ref name="Gralla18May09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=338839 |title=Opinion: Why you shouldn't care about Linux on the desktop |accessdate=20 May 2009 |last=Gralla |first=Preston |date=May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521132147/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=338839 |archivedate=21 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Microsoft]] then-CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] indicated that Linux had a greater desktop market share than Mac, stating that in recent years Linux had "certainly increased its share somewhat". Just under a third of all [[Dell]] netbook sales in 2009 had Linux installed.&lt;ref name="Martin07Sep10"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2010/09/debunking-the-1-myth.html |title = Debunking the 1% Myth|accessdate =14 September 2010|last = Martin|first = Caitlyn|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caitlyn Martin, researching retail market numbers in the summer of 2010 also concluded that the traditional numbers mentioned for Linux desktop adoption were far too low:

{{quote|It seems like almost every day someone in the tech press or someone commenting in a technical forum will claim that Linux adoption on the desktop (including laptops) is insignificant. The number that is thrown around is 1%. These claims are even repeated by some who advocate for Linux adoption. Both the idea that Linux market share on the desktop is insignificant and the 1% figure are simply false and have been for many years...Where does the 1% number come from? There are two sources: very old data and web counters. The problem with using web counters to try and ascertain market share is that they generally only include websites that have paid to be counted. That pretty much guarantees that Windows will be overcounted.|Caitlyn Martin&lt;ref name="Martin07Sep10" /&gt;}}

====Reasons for adoption====
Reasons to change from other operating systems to Linux include better system stability, better [[Linux malware|malware]] protection, low or no cost, that most distributions come complete with application software and hardware drivers, simplified updates for all installed software, free software licensing, availability of application repositories and access to the [[source code]]. Linux desktop distributions also offer multiple desktop workspaces, greater customization, free and unlimited support through forums, and an operating system that doesn't slow down over time. Environmental reasons are also cited, as Linux operating systems usually do not come in boxes and other retail packaging, but are downloaded via the Internet. The lower system specifications also mean that older hardware can be kept in use instead of being recycled or discarded. Linux distributions also get security vulnerabilities patched much more quickly than non-free operating systems and improvements in Linux have been occurring at a faster rate than those in Windows.&lt;ref name="Cornet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Siu28Jul06"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntucat/the-linux-desktop-myth/|title = The Linux Desktop Myth|accessdate =19 March 2009|last = Siu|first = A.Y.|date=July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="Wallen03Sep08"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://resources.zdnet.co.uk/articles/features/0,1000002000,39483863-1,00.htm|title = Ten key differences between Linux and Windows|accessdate =19 March 2009|last = Wallen|first = Jack.|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallen17Aug08"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/linux-and-open-source/why-would-anyone-choose-windows-over-linux/|title = Why would anyone choose Windows over Linux?|accessdate =19 March 2009|last = Wallen |first = Jack |date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report in [[The Economist]] in December 2007 said:

{{cquote|Linux has swiftly become popular in small businesses and the home. That’s largely the doing of Gutsy Gibbon, the code-name for the Ubuntu 7.10 from Canonical. Along with distributions such as Linspire, Mint, Xandros, OpenSUSE and gOS, Ubuntu (and its siblings Kubuntu, Edubuntu and Xubuntu) has smoothed most of Linux’s geeky edges while polishing it for the desktop. No question, Gutsy Gibbon is the sleekest, best integrated and most user-friendly Linux distribution yet. It’s now simpler to set up and configure than Windows.&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10410912|title = Technology in 2008|accessdate =1 April 2008|last = The Economist|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Further investments have been made to improve desktop Linux usability since that 2007 report.

Indian bulk computer purchaser the Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu (ELCOT) started recommending only Linux in June 2008. Following testing they stated: "ELCOT has been using SUSE Linux and Ubuntu Linux operating systems on desktop and laptop computers numbering over 2,000 during the past two years and found them far superior as compared to other operating systems, notably the Microsoft Operating System."&lt;ref name="KingmanJune2008" /&gt;

In many developing nations, such as China, where, due to widespread [[software piracy]], [[Microsoft Windows]] can be easily obtained for free, Linux distributions are gaining a high level of adoption. Hence in these countries where there is essentially no cost barrier to obtaining proprietary operating systems, users are adopting Linux based on its merit, rather than on price.&lt;ref name="Dawson17Jun09" /&gt;

In January 2001, [[Microsoft]] then-CEO [[Bill Gates]] explained the attraction of adopting Linux in an internal memo that was released in the ''Comes vs Microsoft'' case. He said:

{{quote|Our most potent Operating System competitor is Linux and the phenomena around Open Source and free software. The same phenomena fuels competitors to all of our products. The ease of picking up Linux to learn it or to modify some piece of it is very attractive. The academic community, start up companies, foreign governments and many other constituencies are putting their best work into Linux.&lt;ref name="GroklawComesVsMSExhibit08256"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://groklaw.net/pdf/iowa/www.iowaconsumercase.org/011607/8000/PX08256.pdf|title = Comes vs Microsoft E-mail Exhibit |accessdate = 29 June 2009|last = Gates|first = Bill|date=January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

====Barriers to adoption====
The greatest barrier to Linux desktop adoption is probably that few desktop PCs come with it from the factory. A.Y. Siu asserted in 2006 that most people use Windows simply because most PCs come with Windows pre-installed; they didn't choose it. Linux has much lower market penetration because in most cases users have to install it themselves, a task that is beyond the capabilities of many PC users: "Most users won’t even use Windows restore CDs, let alone install Windows from scratch. Why would they install an unfamiliar operating system on their computers?"&lt;ref name="Siu28Jul06" /&gt;{{unreliable source|date=December 2016}}

[[TechRepublic]] writer Jack Wallen expands on this barrier, saying in August 2008:&lt;ref name="Wallen17Aug08" /&gt;

{{quote|Why would anyone choose Windows over Linux?...In my seriously biased opinion, I think this question is answered with a simple conspiracy theory: Microsoft is doing everything it can to keep the public blind to Linux. Think about it? Remember the whole Wintel conspiracy where MS and Intel played off of each other to continue their strangle-hold monopoly in the PC industry? That era played a huge part in the blinding of consumers. Top that with the business practices MS forces upon big box shops to ensure their operating system is sold on nearly every PC sold and you can see that conspiracy is more of a reality than one might think.&lt;ref name="Wallen17Aug08" /&gt; }}

Linus Torvalds stated, in his June 2012 interaction with students at [[Aalto University]],&lt;ref name="aalto"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFKxlYNfT_o |title = Q&amp;A session with Linus Torvalds: Why is Linux not competitive on desktop? |date = 15 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that although Linux was originally conceived as a desktop system, that has been the only market where it has not flourished. He suggested that the key reason that keeps Linux from getting a substantial presence in the desktop market is that the average desktop user does not want to install an operating system, so getting manufacturers to sell computers with Linux pre-installed would be the missing piece to fulfill the vision of Linux in the desktop market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18419231 |title = Linus Torvalds: Linux succeeded thanks to selfishness and trust |author = Leo Kelion |date = 13 June 2012 |publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that Chromebooks, by shipping with the Linux-based [[Chrome OS]], could provide the key turning point in such a transition, much like [[Android (operating system)|Android]] allowed Linux to spread in the mobile space.&lt;ref name="aalto" /&gt;

In September 2012, [[GNOME]] developer [[Michael Meeks (software developer)|Michael Meeks]] also indicated that the main reason for the lack of adoption of Linux desktops is the lack of manufacturers shipping computers with it pre-installed, supporting Siu's arguments from six years earlier. Meeks also indicated that users wouldn't embrace desktop Linux until there is a wider range of applications and developers won't create that wider range of applications until there are more users, a classic [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]] situation.&lt;ref&gt;McAllister, Neil (11 September 2012), [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/11/michael_meeks_linux_desktop/ GNOME hacker: Culture isn't holding desktop Linux back], [[The Register]], retrieved 12 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[openSUSE]] survey conducted in 2007, 69.5% of respondents said they [[dual boot]]ed a [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system in addition to a Linux operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.opensuse.org/opensuse/en/6/6c/Opensuse_survey_102_data_final.pdf |title=openSUSE 10.2 Survey Results |accessdate=19 November 2007 |date=4 May 2007 |format=PDF |work=openSUSE |publisher=openSUSE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516231251/http://files.opensuse.org/opensuse/en/6/6c/Opensuse_survey_102_data_final.pdf |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2007 Bill Whyman, an analyst at Precursor Advisors, noted that "there still isn't a compelling alternative to the [[Microsoft]] infrastructure on the desktop."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Robert A. |last = Guth |title = Linux Starts to Find Home on Desktops |date = 13 March 2007 |publisher = Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117374336173334742 |work = The Wall Street Journal Online |accessdate = 19 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Application support, the quality of peripheral support, and end user support were at one time seen as the biggest obstacles to desktop Linux adoption. According to a 2006 survey by The [[Linux Foundation]], these factors were seen as a "major obstacle" for 56%, 49%, and 33% of respondents respectively at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1462899608;fp;4194304;fpid;1 |title=Living (and dying) with Linux in the workplace |accessdate=19 November 2007 |last=Machlis |first=Sharon |date=22 March 2007 |work=Computerworld |publisher=IDG Communications |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221085731/http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id%3B1462899608%3Bfp%3B4194304%3Bfpid%3B1 |archivedate=21 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=420 |title = Five crucial things the Linux community doesn’t understand about the average computer user |accessdate = 19 November 2007 |last = Kingsley-Hughes |first = Adrian |date = 21 May 2007 |work = ZDNet |publisher = CNET Networks, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS6087894103.html |title=Why Windows wins and Linux loses |accessdate=19 November 2007 |last=Vaughan-Nichols |first=Steven J. |date=3 January 2007 |work=DesktopLinux.com |publisher=Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204050814/http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS6087894103.html |archivedate= 4 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACM"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Desktop Linux: Where Art Thou? |journal = ACM Queue |date=May 2004 |first = Bart |last = Decrem |volume = 2 |issue = 3 |pages = 48–56 |doi = 10.1145/1005062.1005067 |url = http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=155 |accessdate = 19 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS9755856281.html |title=Who are the Linux desktop users? |accessdate=19 November 2007 |last=Vaughan-Nichols |first=Steven J. |date=6 May 2007 |work=DesktopLinux.com |publisher=Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117181549/http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS9755856281.html |archivedate=17 November 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Dell to use Ubuntu on Linux PCs |date = 1 May 2007 |publisher = BBC |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6610901.stm |work = BBC News |accessdate = 19 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Antone |last = Gonsalves |title = Study: Lack Of App Support Stunting Linux |date = 1 December 2005 |publisher = CMP Media LLC |url = http://www.techweb.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=174403447 |work = TechWeb |accessdate = 19 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dell Ubuntu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/ubuntu?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;~ck=mn |title=Ubuntu |accessdate=19 November 2007 |work=Dell Home &amp; Home Office |publisher=Dell |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228203033/http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/ubuntu?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;~ck=mn |archivedate=28 February 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OSDL 2006"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.linux-foundation.org/images/a/a9/2006survey-analysis.pdf |title = 2006 Desktop Linux Client Survey: Analysis |accessdate = 19 November 2007 |year = 2006 |format = PDF |work = OSDL Desktop Linux Working Group |publisher = Linux Foundation }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=Balon Greyjoy |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Application support=====
{{See also|Virtual machine|Wine (software)}}

The November 2006 ''Desktop Linux Client Survey'' identified the foremost barrier for deploying Linux desktops was that users were accustomed to Windows applications which had not been ported to Linux and which they "just can't live without". These included [[Microsoft Office]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[Autodesk]] [[AutoCAD]], [[Microsoft Project]], [[Microsoft Visio|Visio]] and [[Intuit]] [[QuickBooks]].&lt;ref name="OSDL 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steven J. |last=Vaughan-Nichols |title=Where are the American Linux desktop users? |date=23 October 2007 |publisher=Ziff Davis Enterprise Holdings Inc. |url=http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS2619861157.html |work=DesktopLinux.com |accessdate=19 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121011218/http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS2619861157.html |archivedate=21 November 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a [[chicken or the egg]] situation where developers make programs for Windows due to its market share, and consumers use Windows due to availability of said programs.
In a DesktopLinux.com survey conducted in 2007, 72% of respondents said they used ways to run Windows applications on Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desktoplinux.com/cgi-bin/survey/survey.cgi?view=archive&amp;id=0813200712407 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120524145331/http://www.desktoplinux.com/cgi-bin/survey/survey.cgi?view=archive&amp;id=0813200712407 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 May 2012 |title=2007 Desktop Linux Market survey |accessdate=11 December 2007 |date=21 August 2007 |work=DesktopLinux.com |publisher=Ziff Davis Enterprise Holdings Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

51% of respondents to the 2006 Linux Foundation survey, believed that cross-distribution Linux desktop standards should be the top priority for the Linux desktop community, highlighting the fact that the fragmented Linux market is preventing application vendors from developing, distributing and supporting the operating system.&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OSDL 2006" /&gt; In May 2008, [[Gartner]] predicted that "version control and incompatibilities will continue to plague open-source OSs and associated middleware" in the 2013 timeframe.&lt;ref name="ZDNet Gartner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2216 |title=Gartner report forecasts bad news, good news for open source |accessdate=7 April 2008 |last=Rooney |first=Paula |date=1 April 2008 |work=ZDNet |publisher=CNET Networks, Inc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405204558/http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2216 |archivedate= 5 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2008, the design of Linux applications and the porting of Windows and Apple applications had progressed to the point where it was difficult to find an application that did not have an equivalent for Linux, providing adequate or better capabilities.&lt;ref name="Alternatives"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://linuxappfinder.com/alternatives |title = Windows and OS X Software Alternatives |accessdate = 19 March 2009 |last = Linux App Finder |year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TuxSoftware"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.tuxsoftware.com/home/ |title = Linux Software Search |accessdate = 19 March 2009 |last = TuxSoftware.com |year = n.d. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080822001523/http://www.tuxsoftware.com/home/ |archivedate = 22 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of application progress can be seen comparing the main productivity suite for Linux, [[OpenOffice.org]], to [[Microsoft Office]]. With the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 in October 2008 [[Ars Technica]] assessed the two:&lt;ref name="Paul13Oct08"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2008/10/openoffice-org-3-0-officially-released.ars |title = OpenOffice.org 3.0 officially released |accessdate = 19 March 2009 |last = Paul |first = Ryan |date=October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Although OpenOffice.org has not yet reached full parity with Microsoft Office, it is maturing at a rapid pace and is already capable of meeting the basic needs of many average computer users. It is an ideal choice for schools and is an increasingly viable choice for small businesses and home users that don't rely on the more advanced capabilities of Microsoft's office suite.&lt;ref name="Paul13Oct08" /&gt; }}

=====Peripheral support=====
In the past the availability and quality of open source [[device driver]]s were issues for Linux desktops. Particular areas which were lacking drivers included printers as well as wireless and audio cards.&lt;ref name="OSDL 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OSDL 2005"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.linux-foundation.org/images/3/3b/DTL_Survey_Report_Nov2005.pdf |title = 2005 Desktop Linux Client Survey Report |accessdate = 19 November 2007 |year = 2005 |format = PDF |work = OSDL Desktop Linux Working Group |publisher = Linux Foundation }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=Balon Greyjoy |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in early 2007, [[Dell]] did not sell specific hardware and software with [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 7.04 computers, including printers, projectors, [[Bluetooth]] keyboards and mice, [[TV tuner card|TV tuners]] and [[remote control handset|remote controls]], desktop [[modem]]s and [[Blu-ray disc]] drives, due to incompatibilities at that time, as well as legal issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dsn/en/document?c=us&amp;dl=false&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;docid=33C0764C597FC6CCE040A68F5B2872A3&amp;doclang=en |title = Hardware and Software Not Sold on Dell Ubuntu 7.04 Computers |accessdate = 19 November 2007 |date = 26 July 2007 |work = Dell USA |publisher = Dell }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2008, most Linux hardware support and driver issues had been adequately addressed. In September 2008, Jack Wallen's assessment was:

{{quote|Years ago, if you wanted to install Linux on a machine you had to make sure you hand-picked each piece of hardware or your installation would not work 100 percent...This is not so much the case now. You can grab a PC (or laptop) and most likely get one or more Linux distributions to install and work nearly 100 percent. But there are still some exceptions; for instance, hibernate/suspend remains a problem with many laptops, although it has come a long way.&lt;ref name="Wallen03Sep08" /&gt; }}

=====End-user support=====
Some critics have stated that compared to Windows, Linux is lacking in end-user support. Linux has traditionally been seen as requiring much more technical expertise.&lt;ref name="WSJ Mossberg"&gt;{{cite news |first = Walter S. |last = Mossberg |title = Linux's Free System Is Now Easier to Use, But Not for Everyone |date = 13 September 2007 |publisher = Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118963540721725614 |work = The Wall Street Journal Online |accessdate = 19 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crn.com/software/190900617 |title=A Linux OS For All |accessdate=19 November 2007 |last=Ohlhorst |first=Frank J. |date=21 July 2006 |work=CRN |publisher=CMP Media LLC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203004836/http://www.crn.com/software/190900617 |archivedate=3 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dell]]'s website described open source software as requiring intermediate or advanced knowledge to use.&lt;ref name="Dell Ubuntu" /&gt; In September 2007, the founder of the Ubuntu project, [[Mark Shuttleworth]], commented that "it would be reasonable to say that this is not ready for the mass market."&lt;ref name="WSJ Mossberg" /&gt;

In October 2004, [[Chief technical officer|Chief Technical Officer]] of Adeptiva Linux, Stephan February, noted at that time that Linux was a very technical software product, and few people outside the technical community were able to support consumers. Windows users are able to rely on friends and family for help, but Linux users generally use discussion boards, which can be uncomfortable for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Geoffrey P. |last = Ramos |title = Linux not ready for mass market |date = 29 October 2004 |publisher = IDG |url = http://www.techworld.com/opsys/news/index.cfm?NewsID=2510 |work = Techworld |accessdate = 19 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=424 |title = Three more things that the Linux community doesn’t get |accessdate = 19 November 2007 |last = Kingsley-Hughes |first = Adrian |date = 23 May 2007 |work = ZDNet |publisher = CNET Networks, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Dominic Humphries summarized the difference in user tech support:&lt;ref name="Humphries"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm |title = Linux is Not Windows |accessdate = 19 March 2009 |last = Humphries |first = Dominic |date=December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Windows users are more or less in a customer-supplier relationship: They pay for software, for warranties, for support, and so on. They expect software to have a certain level of usability. They are therefore used to having rights with their software: They have paid for technical support and have every right to demand that they receive it. They are also used to dealing with entities rather than people: Their contracts are with a company, not with a person.

Linux users are in more of a community. They don't have to buy the software, they don't have to pay for technical support. They download software for free &amp; use Instant Messaging and web-based forums to get help. They deal with people, not corporations.&lt;ref name="Humphries" /&gt; }}

More recently critics have found that the Linux user support model, using community-based forum support, has greatly improved. In 2008 Jack Wallen stated:&lt;ref name="Wallen03Sep08" /&gt;

{{quote|With Linux, you have the support of a huge community via forums, online search, and plenty of dedicated websites. And of course, if you feel the need, you can purchase support contracts from some of the bigger Linux companies (Red Hat and Novell, for instance).

However, when you use the peer support inherent in Linux, you do take a chance with time. You could have an issue with something, send out email to a mailing list or post on a forum, and within 10 minutes be flooded with suggestions. Or these suggestions could take hours or days to come in. It seems all up to chance sometimes.

Yet generally speaking, most problems with Linux have been encountered and documented, so the chances are good you'll find your solution fairly quickly.&lt;ref name="Wallen03Sep08" /&gt; }}

In addressing the question of user support, Manu Cornet said:

{{quote|One of the great assets of the Open Source community (and Linux in particular), is that it's a real community. Users and developers really are out there, on web forums, on mailing lists, on IRC channels, helping out new users. They're all happy to see more and more people switch to Linux, and they're happy to help them get a grip on their new system...you'll find literally thousands of places where nice people will answer you and walk you out of your problem most of the time&lt;ref name="Cornet" /&gt; }}

=====Other factors=====
Linux's credibility has also been under attack at times, but as Ron Miller of LinuxPlanet points out:&lt;ref name="LinuxPlanet"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/5401/1/ |title = Linux Criticism Revs Up |accessdate = 19 November 2007 |last = Miller |first = Ron |date = 20 May 2004 |work = LinuxPlanet |publisher = Jupitermedia Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...the fact that Linux is being criticized is probably a good thing.

First of all, it shows that Linux is making headway in the enterprise and beginning to have an impact on competitors and they are reacting to that. Secondly, it's healthy to take a long look at any solution and analyze its strengths and weaknesses and the economic ramifications of one choice over another.

Ultimately, consumers and decision makers need to look carefully at the data including the sources of the data and the criticism and decide if Linux is the right decision, but as more people choose Linux and it finds its place in the market, it is bound to wear a target. That's simply the price you pay for success in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="LinuxPlanet" /&gt; }}

There is continuing debate about the [[total cost of ownership]] of Linux,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Vincent |last=Ryan |title=Anti-Linux Comments Rile Supporters |date=19 June 2003 |publisher=NewsFactor Network |url=http://www.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=21764 |work=NewsFactor.com |accessdate=19 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203014025/http://www.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=21764 |archivedate=3 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jennifer |last=Mears |title=Novell boosts its Linux desktop |date=13 March 2006 |publisher=Network World, Inc. |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/031306-novell-linux.html |work=Network World |accessdate=19 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203000603/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/031306-novell-linux.html |archivedate= 3 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Gartner]] warning in 2005 that the costs of migration may exceed the cost benefits of Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Andy |last = McCue |title = Gartner sounds desktop Linux warning |date = 9 September 2005 |publisher = CNET Networks, Inc. |url = http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39217113,00.htm |work = silicon.com |accessdate = 19 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gartner reiterated the warning in 2008, predicting that "by 2013, a majority of Linux deployments will have no real software total cost of ownership (TCO) advantage over other operating systems."&lt;ref name="ZDNet Gartner" /&gt; However, in the Comes v. Microsoft lawsuit, Plaintiff's exhibit 2817&lt;ref&gt;[http://groklaw.net/pdf/Comes-2817.pdf Plaintiff's exhibit 2817]&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that Microsoft successfully lobbied Gartner for changing their TCO model in favour of Microsoft in 1998. Organizations that have moved to Linux have disagreed with these warnings. Sterling Ball, CEO of [[Ernie Ball]], the world's leading maker of premium guitar strings and a 2003 Linux adopter, said of total cost of ownership arguments: "I think that's propaganda...What about the cost of dealing with a virus? We don't have 'em...There's no doubt that what I'm doing is cheaper to operate. The analyst guys can say whatever they want."&lt;ref name="Becker2003"&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090707003009/http://news.cnet.com/2008-1082_3-5065859.html?tag=lh Rockin' on without Microsoft | Newsmakers | CNET News.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[SCO-Linux controversies]], the [[SCO Group]] had alleged that [[UNIX]] source code donated by IBM was illegally incorporated into Linux. The threat that SCO might be able to legally assert ownership of Linux initially caused some potential Linux adopters to delay that move. The court cases bankrupted SCO in 2007 after it lost its four-year court battle over the ownership of the UNIX copyrights. SCO's case had hinged on showing that Linux included intellectual property that had been misappropriated from UNIX, but the case failed when the court discovered that [[Novell]] and not SCO was the rightful owner of the copyrights. During the legal process, it was revealed that SCO's claims about Linux were fraudulent and that SCO's internal source code audits had showed no evidence of infringement.&lt;ref name="LinuxPlanet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Becker2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul12Jan09"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/01/sco-aims-to-reorganize-fight-on-with-corporate-garage-sale.ars |title = SCO aims to reorganize, fight on with corporate garage sale |accessdate = 19 March 2009 |last = Paul |first = Ryan |date=January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rival operating system vendor, [[Green Hills Software]], has called the [[open source]] paradigm of Linux "fundamentally insecure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Alexander |last = Wolfe |title = Green Hills calls Linux 'insecure' for defense |date = 4 September 2004 |publisher = CMP Media LLC |url = http://www.eetimes.com/article/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=18900949 |work = EE Times |accessdate = 19 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Army does not agree that Linux is a security problem. Brigadier General Nick Justice, the Deputy Program Officer for the Army's Program Executive Office, Command, Control and Communications Tactical (PEO C3T), said in April 2007:&lt;ref name="DoD" /&gt;

{{quote|Our job is to provide accurate and timely information to the soldier in the field so they can perform their mission. Open source software is part of the integrated network fabric which connects and enables our command and control system to work effectively, as people's lives depend on it.

===Netbooks===
{{Main article|Netbook#Linux|l1 = Netbook (Linux)}}
In 2008, [[Gartner]] analysts predicted that mobile devices like Netbooks with Linux could potentially break the dominance of [[Microsoft]]'s Windows as operating system provider, as the netbook concept focuses on OS-agnostic applications built as Web applications and browsing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9076698/Windows_is_collapsing_Gartner_analysts_warn|title=Windows is 'collapsing,' Gartner analysts warn - The researchers damn Windows in current form, urge radical changes |first=Gregg |last=Keizer |date=10 April 2008 |accessdate=2013-10-03 |publisher=[[Computer World]] |quote=''And increasingly, users work with "OS-agnostic applications," the two analysts said in their presentation.

===Web thin clients===
{{Main article|Thin client#Web_thin_client|l1 = Web thin client}}
{{Expand section|date = September 2013}}
In 2011, [[Google]] introduced the [[Chromebook]], a [[web thin client]] running the Linux-based [[Chrome OS]], with the ability to use [[web applications]] and [[remote desktop]] in to other computers running Windows, Mac OS X, a traditional Linux distribution or Chrome OS, using [[Chrome Remote Desktop]]. In 2012 Google and Samsung introduced the first version of the Chromebox, a small-form-factor desktop equivalent to the Chromebook.

By 2013, Chromebooks had captured 20–25% of the sub-$300 US laptop market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/10173494/Google-Chromebook-sales-soar-in-face-of-PC-decline.html|title = Google Chromebook sales soar in face of PC decline|date = 11 July 2013|accessdate = 3 September 2013|website = [[Daily Telegraph]]|last = Williams|first = Rhiannon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile devices===
[[File:Samsung Galaxy Note series 2.jpg|thumb|Android smartphones]]

''Note: The term "mobile devices" in the computing context refers to cellphones and tablets; ''{{asof|2013|lc = y}}'', the term does not include regular laptops, despite the fact that they have always been designed to be mobile.''

[[Android (operating system)|Android]], which is based on Linux and is open source, is the most popular mobile platform.

==== Discontinued Linux-based mobile operating systems ====
[[Firefox OS]] was another open source Linux-based mobile operating system, which has now been discontinued.

Nokia previously produced some phones running a variant of Linux (e.g. the [[Nokia N900]]), but in 2013, Nokia's handset division was bought by [[Microsoft]].

===Other embedded systems with graphical user interface===
[[Smartphone]]s are gradually replacing these kinds of embedded devices, but they still exist. An example are the [[Portable media player]]s. Some of the OEM firmware is Linux based. A community-driven fully free and open-source project is [[Rockbox]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

[[In-vehicle infotainment]] hardware usually involves some kind of display, either built into the [[Dashboard]] or additional displays. The [[GENIVI Alliance]] works on a Linux-based open platform to run the IVI. It may have an interface to some values delivered by the [[Engine control unit]] but is albeit completely separate system. There will be a special variant of [[Tizen]] for IVI, different for the Tizen for smartphones in several regards.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Hardware platforms without graphical user interface==

===Embedded systems without graphical user interface===
{{See also|Linux devices}}
Linux is often used in various single- or multi-purpose [[computer appliance]]s and [[embedded systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT4936596231.html|title=The Linux Devices Showcase&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312084819/http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT4936596231.html|archivedate=2009-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Customer-premises equipment]] are a group of devices that are embedded and have no graphical user interface in the common sense. Some are remotely operated via [[Secure Shell]] or via some Web-based user interface running on some [[Comparison of lightweight web servers|lightweight web server software]]. Most of the OEM firmware is based on the Linux kernel and other free and open-source software, e.g. [[Das U-Boot]] and [[Busybox]]. There are also a couple of community driven projects, e.g. [[OpenWrt]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Smaller scale embedded [[network-attached storage]]-devices are also mostly Linux-driven.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Servers===
{{further|Linux#Servers, mainframes and supercomputers}}

Linux became popular in the Internet [[Server (computing)|server]] market particularly due to the [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]] software bundle. In September 2008 [[Steve Ballmer]] (Microsoft CEO) claimed 60% of servers run Linux and 40% run [[Windows Server]].&lt;ref name="PC World September 2008"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.pcworld.com/article/151568/ballmer_still_searching_for_an_answer_to_google.html|title = Ballmer Still Searching for an Answer to Google|accessdate =4 June 2009|last = Niccolai|first = James|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to IDC's report covering Q2 2013, Linux was up to 23.2% of worldwide server revenue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/linux-is-king-nix-of-the-data-center-but-unix-may-live-on-forever/ | title=Linux is king *nix of the data center—but Unix may live on forever | accessdate = 2013-11-01 | last=Brodkin | first = Jon | date=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this does compensate for the potential price disparity between Linux and non-Linux servers. In May 2014, W3Techs estimated that 67.5% of the top 10 million (according to Alexa) websites run some form of Unix, and Linux is used by at least 57.2% of all those websites which use Unix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-unix/all/all | title=Usage Statistics and Market Share of Unix for Websites, May 2014 | work=W3Techs | date = May 2014 | accessdate= 14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Web servers====
Linux-based [[solution stack]]s come with all the [[Free and open-source software#Advantages and benefits of free and open-source software|general advantages and benefits of free and open-source software]]. Some more commonly known examples are:
* [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]]
* [[MEAN stack]]

According to the [[Netcraft]], {{asof|2013|lc=1}}, the Apache HTTP Server had the highest market share.&lt;ref&gt;Netcraft, [http://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey Survey] May, June, July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====LDAP servers====
{{Main article|Lightweight Directory Access Protocol}}
There are various freely available implementations of [[List of LDAP software#SERVER|LDAP servers]]. Additionally, [[Univention Corporate Server]], as an integrated management system based on Debian, supports the functions provided by Microsoft [[Active Directory]] for the administration of computers running Microsoft Windows.

====Routers====
Free routing software available for Linux includes [[Bird Internet routing daemon|BIRD]], [[B.A.T.M.A.N.]], [[Quagga (software)|Quagga]] and [[XORP]]. Whether on [[Customer-premises equipment]], on [[Personal computer hardware]] or on [[Server (computing)|server]]-hardware, the mainline Linux kernel or an adapted highly optimized Linux kernel is capable of doing [[routing]] at rates that are limited by the hardware bus throughput.

===Supercomputers===
{{Main article|Supercomputer operating systems}}
Linux is the most popular operating system among [[supercomputer]]s due to the [[free and open-source software#Advantages and benefits of free and open-source software|general advantages and benefits of free and open-source software]], like superior performance, flexibility, speed and lower costs. In November 2008 Linux held an 87.8 percent share of the world's top 500 supercomputers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.top500.org/stats/list/34/osfam Operating system Family share for 11/2009 | TOP500 Supercomputing Sites&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119022533/http://www.top500.org/stats/list/34/osfam |date=19 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Top500 OS.png]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CW23Nov09"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blogs.computerworld.com/linux_it_doesnt_get_any_faster|title = Linux: It doesn't get any faster|accessdate = 24 June 2009|last = Vaughn-Nichols|first = Steven J.|date = June 2009|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090626043246/http://blogs.computerworld.com/linux_it_doesnt_get_any_faster|archivedate = 26 June 2009|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PT13Jun08"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://practical-tech.com/infrastructure/linux-computer-smashes-petaflop-supercomputer-barrier/ |title = Linux Computer Smashes Petaflop Supercomputer Barrier|accessdate =15 October 2009|last = Practical Technology|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InTech01Sep03"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isa.org/InTechTemplate.cfm?Section=InTech&amp;template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=29241 |title=Linux elbows into super-computer turf |accessdate=15 October 2009 |last=Strothman |first=Jim |date=September 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050805073753/http://www.isa.org/InTechTemplate.cfm?Section=InTech&amp;template=%2FContentManagement%2FContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=29241 |archivedate=5 August 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent supercomputer the organization built, the Dawning 5000a, which was first run in 2008, used AMD chips and ran [[Windows HPC Server 2008]].&lt;ref name="Mims19Jan10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/24374/?a=f |title=China Details Homemade Supercomputer Plans |accessdate=20 January 2010 |last=Mims |first=Christopher |date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==
Many organizations advocate for Linux adoption. The foremost of these is the [[Linux Foundation]] which hosts and sponsors the key kernel developers, manages the Linux trademark, manages the Open Source Developer Travel Fund, provides legal aid to open source developers and companies through the Linux Legal Defense Fund, sponsors kernel.org and also hosts the Patent Commons Project.

The [[International Free and Open Source Software Foundation]] (iFOSSF) is a nonprofit organization based in [[Michigan]], USA dedicated to accelerating and promoting the adoption of FOSS worldwide through research and civil society partnership networks.

The [[Open Invention Network]] was formed to protect vendors and customers from patent royalty fees while using [[Open-source software|OSS]].

Other advocates for Linux include:
* [[IBM]] through its Linux Marketing Strategy
* [[Linux User Group]]s
* [[Asian Open Source Centre]] (AsiaOSC)
* [[Brazil|The Brazilian government]], under president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A lei é digitalizar|url=http://www.softwarelivre.gov.br|publisher=softwarelivre.gov.br|accessdate=23 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512082208/http://www.softwarelivre.gov.br/|archive-date=12 May 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}} {{Link language|pt}}&lt;!--Portuguese--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* In June 2008, the Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu (ELCOT), a bulk computer buyer for students in the [[India]]n state of [[Tamil Nadu]], decided to switch entirely to supplying Linux after Microsoft attempted to use its monopoly position to sell the organization Windows bundled with [[Microsoft Office]].

* In mid-2009, [[Asus]], as part of its ''It's better with Windows'' campaign, stopped offering Linux, for which they received strong criticism.

Vaughan-Nichols said "I'm sure that the real reason is Microsoft has pressured Asus into abandoning Linux. On ASUS' site, you'll now see the slogan 'ASUS recommends Windows 7' proudly shown.

* In June 2010, a [[Quebec Superior Court]] Judge Denis Jacques ruled that the provincial government broke the law when it spent [[Canadian dollar|Cdn$]]720,000, starting in the fall of 2006 to migrate 800 government workstations to Microsoft Windows Vista and Office 2007 without carrying out a "serious and documented search" for alternatives. The search for alternatives was legally required for any expenditures over Cdn$25,000. The court case was brought by ''Savoir Faire Linux'', a small [[Montreal]]-based company that had hoped to bid Linux software to replace the government's aging Windows XP. The judge dismissed the government's contention that Microsoft software was chosen because employees were already familiar with Windows and that switching to a different operating system would have cost more.&lt;ref name="CBC03Jun10"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2010/06/03/quebec-microsoft-lawsuit.html|title = Quebec broke law in buying Microsoft software|accessdate =3 June 2010|last = Nowak|first = Peter|date=June 2010 | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''M4''' was a French [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] (SLBM) deployed on the nuclear {{Sclass-|Redoutable|submarine|2||1967}}s (except the ''Redoutable'' herself, which was not refitted).&lt;ref name="FAS"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fas.org/nuke/guide/france/slbm/m-4.htm |title=M-4 / M-45 - France Nuclear Forces |work=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |year=2014 |accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They entered service on May 1, 1985. They were the first French [[MIRV]]-capable nuclear missiles, with six 150 [[kilotonne]] warheads.&lt;ref name="FAS"/&gt;

They were replaced by the improved [[M45 SLBM]] missile which is currently in active service aboard the

[[File:Unix manual.png|thumb|The man page on {{tt|man(1)}}, as seen in various [[Linux distribution]]s. This version of the utility predates Linux itself, but is now maintained by the [[Debian]] project.|330x330px]]

A '''man page''' (short for '''manual page''') is a form of [[software documentation]] usually found on a [[Unix]] or [[Unix-like]] [[Operating System|operating system]]. Topics covered include [[computer program]]s (including [[library (computing)|library]] and [[system call]]s), formal standards and conventions, and even abstract concepts. A [[User (computing)|user]] may invoke a man page by issuing the &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; [[Command (computing)|command]].

By default, &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; typically uses a [[terminal pager]] program such as &lt;code&gt;[[more (command)|more]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[[less (Unix)|less]]&lt;/code&gt; to display its output.

==History==
[[File:Screenshot of "Xman" program.png|thumb|''xman'', an early [[X11]] application for viewing manual pages]]
[[File:OpenBSD Manpages Section 8 Intro.png|thumb|[[OpenBSD]] section 8 intro manpage, displaying in a text console]]

In the first two years of the [[history of Unix]], no documentation existed.&lt;ref name="reader"&gt;{{cite techreport |first1=M. D. |last1=McIlroy |authorlink1=Doug McIlroy |year=1987 |url=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/reader.pdf |title=A Research Unix reader: annotated excerpts from the Programmer's Manual, 1971–1986 |series=CSTR |number=139 |institution=Bell Labs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[http://man.cat-v.org/unix-1st/ Unix Programmer's Manual]'' was first published on November 3, 1971. The first actual man pages were written by [[Dennis Ritchie]] and [[Ken Thompson]] at the insistence of their manager [[Douglas McIlroy|Doug McIlroy]] in 1971. Aside from the man pages, the ''Programmer's Manual'' also accumulated a set of short papers, some of them [[tutorial]]s (e.g. for general Unix usage, the [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language, and tools such as [[Yacc]]), and others more detailed descriptions of operating system features. The printed version of the manual initially fit into a single binder, but as of [[PWB/UNIX]] and the [[Version 7 Unix|7th Edition]] of [[Research Unix]], it was split into two volumes with the printed man pages forming Volume 1.&lt;ref name="evolution"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collyer.net/who/geoff/history.html |title=UNIX Evolution: 1975-1984 Part I - Diversity |last1=Darwin |first1=Ian  |last2=Collyer |first2=Geoffrey |accessdate=22 December 2012}} Originally published in ''Microsystems'' '''5'''(11), November 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later versions of the documentation imitated the first man pages' terseness. Ritchie added a "How to get started" section to the [[Version 3 Unix|Third Edition]] introduction, and [[Lorinda Cherry]] provided the "Purple Card" pocket reference for the [[Version 6 Unix|Sixth]] and [[Version 7 Unix|Seventh]] Editions.{{r|reader}} Versions of the software were named after the revision of the manual; the seventh edition of the ''Unix Programmer's Manual'', for example, came with the 7th Edition or Version 7 of Unix.&lt;ref name="fiedler198310"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-10/1983_10_BYTE_08-10_UNIX#page/n133/mode/2up | title=The Unix Tutorial / Part 3: Unix in the Microcomputer Marketplace | work=BYTE | date=October 1983 | accessdate=30 January 2015 | author=Fiedler, Ryan | pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Version 4 Unix|Fourth]] Edition the man pages were formatted using the [[troff]] typesetting package{{r|reader}} and its set of &lt;code&gt;-man&lt;/code&gt; macros (which were completely revised between the Sixth and Seventh Editions of the ''Manual'',&lt;ref name="evolution"/&gt; but have since not drastically changed). At the time, the availability of online documentation through the manual page system was regarded as a great advance. To this day, virtually every Unix command line application comes with a man page, and many Unix users perceive a program's lack of man pages as a sign of low quality; indeed, some projects, such as [[Debian]], go out of their way to write man pages for programs lacking one. The modern descendants of [[Berkeley Software Distribution|4.4BSD]] also distribute man pages as one of the primary forms of system documentation (having replaced the old &lt;code&gt;-man&lt;/code&gt; macros with the newer &lt;code&gt;-mdoc&lt;/code&gt;).

Few alternatives to &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; have enjoyed much popularity, with the possible exception of [[GNU Project|GNU Project's]] "&lt;code&gt;[[Texinfo|info]]&lt;/code&gt;" system, an early and simple [[hypertext]] system.
In addition, some Unix [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] applications (particularly those built using the [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] development environments) now provide end-user documentation in [[HTML]] and include embedded HTML viewers such as &lt;code&gt;yelp&lt;/code&gt; for reading the help within the application.

Man pages are usually written in English, but translations into other languages may be available on the system.

[[File:FreeBSD typeset man page.png|thumb|Part of the [[FreeBSD]] {{tt|man(1)}} manual page, typeset into [[portable document format|PDF]] format.]]
The default format of the man pages is [[troff]], with either the [[troff macros|macro package]] man (appearance oriented) or [[mdoc]] (semantic oriented). This makes it possible to typeset a man page into [[PostScript]], [[portable document format|PDF]], and various other formats for viewing or printing.

Most [[Unix]] systems have a package for the man2html command, which enables users to browse their man pages using an html browser (textproc/man2html on [[FreeBSD]] or ''man'' on some [[Linux]] distribution).

In 2010, [[OpenBSD]] deprecated [[troff]] for formatting manpages in favour of [[mandoc]], a specialised compiler/formatter for manpages with native support for output in [[PostScript]], [[HTML]], [[XHTML]], and the terminal.

In February 2013, the [[BSD]] community saw a new open source [http://mdoc.su/ mdoc.su] service launched, which unified and shortened access to the man.cgi scripts of the major modern BSD projects through a unique [[nginx]]-based deterministic [[URL shortening]] service for the *BSD man pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2013-01-2013-03.html#mdoc.su-%E2%80%94-Short-Manual-Page-URLs &lt;!--|archive-url=http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-announce/2013-May/001475.html--&gt; |title=FreeBSD Quarterly Status Report, January-March 2013 |publisher=[[FreeBSD]] |editor-first=Gabor |editor-last=Pali |date=12 May 2013 |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |date=19 February 2013 |url=http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-doc/2013-February/021465.html |mailinglist=freebsd-doc@freebsd.org |title=announcing mdoc.su, short manual page URLs |first=Constantine A. |last=Murenin |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdoc.su/ |title=mdoc.su — Short manual page URLs for FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and DragonFly BSD |first=Constantine A. |last=Murenin |date=23 February 2013 |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a hidden [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] in the man-db version of the man command that would cause the command to return "gimme gimme gimme" when run at 00:30 (a reference to the [[ABBA]] song [[Gimme!

== Command usage ==
To read a manual page for a Unix command, a user can type:

&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
man &lt;command_name&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Pages are traditionally referred to using the notation "name(section)": for example, {{man|1|ftp|FreeBSD||inline}}. The section refers to different ways the topic might be referenced - for example, as a system call, or a shell (command line) command or package, or a package's configuration file, or as a coding construct / header.

The same page name may appear in more than one section of the manual, such as when the names of [[system call]]s, user [[Command (computing)|command]]s, or [[Troff macro|macro packages]] coincide. Examples are {{man|1|man|ManKier||inline}} and {{man|7|man|ManKier||inline}}, or {{man|2|exit|Linux||inline}} and {{man|3|exit|Linux||inline}}. The syntax for accessing the non-default manual section varies between different man implementations. 

On Solaris and illumos, for example, the syntax for reading {{man|3c|printf|Solaris||inline}} is:
&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
man -s 3c printf
&lt;/source&gt;
On Linux and BSD derivatives the same invocation would be:
&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
man 3 printf
&lt;/source&gt;

which searches for ''[[printf]]'' in section 3 of the man pages.

== Manual sections ==
{{unref|section|date=November 2018}}
The manual is generally split into eight numbered sections, organized as follows (on [[Research Unix]], [[BSD]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]]):

{| class="wikitable"
!Section
!Description
|-
|1
|General [[Command (computing)|command]]s
|-
|2
|[[System call]]s
|-
|3
|[[library (computing)|Library]] functions, covering in particular the [[C standard library]]
|-
|4
|[[Special file]]s (usually devices, those found in /dev) and [[device driver|drivers]]
|-
|5
|[[File format]]s and conventions
|-
|6
|[[Video game|Game]]s and [[screensaver]]s
|-
|7
|Miscellanea
|-
|8
|System administration [[command (computing)|command]]s and [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]]s
|}

Unix [[System V]] uses a similar numbering scheme, except in a different order:

{| class="wikitable"
!Section
!Description
|-
|1
|General [[Command (computing)|command]]s
|-
|1M
|System administration [[command (computing)|command]]s and [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]]s
|-
|2
|[[System call]]s
|-
|3
|[[C library]] functions
|-
|4
|[[File format]]s and conventions
|-
|5
|Miscellanea
|-
|6
|[[Video game|Game]]s and [[screensaver]]s
|-
|7
|[[Special file]]s (usually devices, those found in /dev) and [[device driver|drivers]]
|-
|}

On some systems some of the following sections are available:

{| class="wikitable"
!Section
!Description
|-
|0
|[[C library]] [[header file]]s
|-
|9
|[[Kernel (computing)|Kernel]] routines
|-
|n
|[[Tcl]]/[[Tk (computing)|Tk]] keywords
|-
|x
|The [[X Window System]]
|}

Some sections are further subdivided by means of a suffix; for example, in some systems, section 3C is for C library calls, 3M is for the math library, and so on. A consequence of this is that section 8 (system administration commands) is sometimes relegated to the 1M subsection of the main commands section.  Some subsection suffixes have a general meaning across sections:
{| class="wikitable"
!Subsection
!Description
|-
|p || [[POSIX]] specifications
|-
|x || [[X Window System]] documentation
|}

Some versions of &lt;tt&gt;man&lt;/tt&gt; cache the formatted versions of the last several pages viewed.

== Layout ==
All man pages follow a common layout that is optimized for presentation on a simple [[ASCII]] text display, possibly without any form of highlighting or font control. Sections present may include: 

; NAME: The name of the command or function, followed by a one-line description of what it does.
; SYNOPSIS: In the case of a command, a formal description of how to run it and what command line options it takes.  For program functions, a list of the parameters the function takes and which header file contains its definition.
; DESCRIPTION: A textual description of the functioning of the command or function.
; EXAMPLES: Some examples of common usage.
; SEE ALSO: A list of related commands or functions.

Other sections may be present, but these are not well standardized across man pages.  Common examples include: OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ENVIRONMENT, BUGS, FILES, AUTHOR, REPORTING BUGS, HISTORY and COPYRIGHT.

'''Nahum Sharfman''' was an [[Israelis|Israeli]] tech [[entrepreneur]] who, along with [[Amir Ashkenazi]], founded [[Shopping.com]]. Shopping.com was later acquired by eBay for $650 million. He was also the Chairman of social content sharing site [[eSnips]] Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=161881&amp;privcapId=26789872&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to shopping.com, Sharfman co-founded the IT security company [[Commtouch]] for which he served as the [[Chairman of the Board]] from its inception in February 1991 to November 1997.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084577/000129697905000085/c10245_ex99-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Commtouch IPO'ed in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/spos/filing.ashx?filingid=1138663&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to starting his own ventures, Sharfman spent 11 years working for National Semiconductor. He received a Ph.D. in High Energy Nuclear Physics from Carnegie Mellon University and M.S. and B.S. degrees in Physics from the Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology.

Sharfman and his wife, Nava, died in a [[plane crash]] on the [[Mount Ainos]] in the [[Ioanian]] island of [[Kefallinia|Cephallonia]], [[Greece]] while en route to [[Corfu]] on April 29, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/29/breaking-nahum-sharfman-founder-of-shoppingcom-perishes-in-plane-crash&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nano electrokinetic thruster''' is a theoretical space propulsion system based on the principle of [[electro-osmosis]] (also electroosmotic flow). It allows for a high [[specific impulse]] and high [[thrust]]-to-power ratio as well as a high final velocity which makes it suitable for a wide variety of applications. Due to difficulties in the production of the needed [[carbon nanotubes]] experimental testing has not yet started.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diez|first1=F.J.|last2=Hernaiz|first2=G.|last3=Miranda|first3=J.J.|last4=Sureda|first4=M.|title=On the capabilities of nano electrokinetic thrusters for space propulsion|journal=Acta Astronautica|date=February–March 2013|volume=83|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.09.020|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576512003773|accessdate=11 November 2014|bibcode=2013AcAau..83...97D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The principle of electro-osmosis or electroosmotic flow creates a flow of an [[electrolyte]] through a very small tube in the nano-meter range. To achieve this flow there is a [[cathode]] and an [[anode]] at the ends of the tube over which a voltage is applied. Due to this voltage the ions in the electrolyte stored in a reservoir directly connected to the tube can be accelerated and ejected. This way [[electrical energy]] is transformed into [[kinetic energy]]. The amount of thrust created by one nano thruster is in the micro newton range, however due to its size it makes sense to arrange a big amount in an array to achieve sufficient thrust. The thrust, exit velocity of the [[ions]] and the [[mass flow rate]] of the electrolyte are influenced by the applied [[voltage]] which makes it easy to regulate those parameters. The applied voltage and the [[ph|pH-value]] of the electrolyte (amount of ions it contains) also vary the balance between thrust, efficiency and maximal exhaust velocity (determines the maximal achievable flight velocity). It is also theoretically possible to achieve a very high [[efficiency]] of nearly 100%&lt;ref name=patent&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garias|first1=Diez|title=ELECTROKINETIC NANOTHRUSTERS AND  APPLICATIONS THEREOF|url=http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US20140070663.pdf|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a high specific impulse and high thrust-to-power ratio. This system has not yet been built and experimentally tested because of difficulties with the production of the nano-tubes needed for it.&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

==Advantages==

Nano electrokinetic thrusters have a very high efficiency, specific impulse, exhaust velocity and thrust-to-power ratio which make them suitable for a wide variety of applications. Due to the fact that a thruster is made up out of an array of multiple nano thrusters it is easily possible to design thursters in all sizes and thrust ranges. These properties give the nano electrokinetic thrusters very good thrust control which makes it applicable for a wide range of spacecraft ranging from maneuvering thrusters for small spacecraft, such as satellites, to the primary propulsion system of interplanetary or interstellar spacecraft. This system also doesn't require additional [[Heat shield|heat]] or [[Radiation protection|radiation shielding]] to protect the rest of the space craft which make the system (not including fuel compartment) light in comparison to other designs.&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

==Disadvantages==

The production of the required carbon nano tubes is very expensive and with current production methods the amount of surface defects in the produced carbon nano tubes is high which reduces the efficiency significantly and makes it unreliable. This design also requires a high potential difference in the range of 300 to 500 volts as well as a sufficient storage tank for the liquid electrolyte needed which increase the weight of the overall system.&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

A '''nuclear reactor''', formerly known as an '''atomic pile''', is a device used to initiate and control a self-sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. Nuclear reactors are used at [[nuclear power plant]]s for [[nuclear power|electricity generation]] and in [[nuclear marine propulsion|propulsion of ships]]. Heat from [[nuclear fission]] is passed to a working fluid (water or gas), which in turn runs through [[steam turbine]]s. These either drive a ship's [[propeller]]s or turn [[electrical generator]]s' shafts. Nuclear generated steam in principle can be used for industrial process heat or for [[district heating]]. Some reactors are used to produce [[isotope]]s for [[Nuclear medicine|medical]] and [[industrial radiography|industrial]] use, or for production of [[weapons-grade]] [[plutonium]]. Some [[Research reactor|are run only for research]]. As of April 2014, the IAEA reports there are 435 nuclear power reactors in operation, in 31 countries around the world.&lt;ref name="Newman2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Newman, Jay |title=Physics of the Life Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vY5rXC4xlMgC|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-77258-5|page=652}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 2017, this increased to 447 operable reactors according to the World Nuclear Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/nuclear-basics/global-number-of-nuclear-reactors.aspx|title=Number of nuclear reactors - World Nuclear Association|website=www.world-nuclear.org|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
{{Main article|Nuclear reactor physics}}

[[File:Nuclear fission.svg|upright=1.15|thumb|An example of an induced nuclear fission event. A neutron is absorbed by the nucleus of a uranium-235 atom, which in turn splits into fast-moving lighter elements (fission products) and free neutrons. Though both reactors and [[nuclear weapons]] rely on nuclear chain-reactions, the rate of reactions in a reactor occurs much more slowly than in a bomb.]]

Just as conventional [[thermal power station|power-stations]] generate electricity by harnessing the [[thermal energy]] released from burning [[fossil fuels]], nuclear reactors convert the energy released by controlled [[nuclear fission]] into thermal energy for further conversion to mechanical or electrical forms.

===Fission===
{{main article|Nuclear fission}}

When a large [[fissile]] [[atomic nucleus]] such as [[uranium-235]] or [[plutonium-239]] absorbs a neutron, it may undergo nuclear fission. The heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, (the [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]]), releasing [[kinetic energy]], [[gamma rays|gamma radiation]], and [[free neutron]]s. A portion of these [[neutron]]s may later be absorbed by other fissile atoms and trigger further fission events, which release more neutrons, and so on. This is known as a [[nuclear chain reaction]].

To control such a nuclear chain reaction, [[neutron poison]]s and [[neutron moderators]] can change the portion of neutrons that will go on to cause more fission.&lt;ref name="DOE HAND"/&gt; Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to shut the fission reaction down if monitoring detects unsafe conditions.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Reactor Protection &amp; Engineered Safety Feature Systems |work=The Nuclear Tourist |url=http://www.nucleartourist.com/systems/rp.htm |accessdate=25 September 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly used moderators include regular (light) water (in 74.8% of the world's reactors), solid [[graphite]] (20% of reactors) and [[heavy water]] (5% of reactors). Some experimental types of reactor have used [[beryllium]], and [[hydrocarbons]] have been suggested as another possibility.&lt;ref name="DOE HAND"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=covers general theory of moderators. does not discuss specific options or percentages.|date=August 2012}}

===Heat generation===
The reactor core generates heat in a number of ways:
* The [[kinetic energy]] of fission products is converted to [[thermal energy]] when these nuclei collide with nearby atoms.
* The reactor absorbs some of the [[gamma rays]] produced during fission and converts their energy into heat.
* Heat is produced by the [[radioactive decay]] of fission products and materials that have been activated by [[neutron absorption]]. This decay heat-source will remain for some time even after the reactor is shut down.

===Cooling===
A [[nuclear reactor coolant]] — usually water but sometimes a gas or a liquid metal (like [[Liquid sodium#Heat transfer|liquid sodium]]) or [[molten salt]] — is circulated past the reactor core to absorb the heat that it generates. The heat is carried away from the reactor and is then used to generate steam. Most reactor systems employ a cooling system that is physically separated from the water that will be boiled to produce pressurized steam for the [[turbines]], like the [[pressurized water reactor]]. However, in some reactors the water for the steam turbines is boiled directly by the [[reactor core]]; for example the [[boiling water reactor]].&lt;ref name="HSWCOOLANT"&gt;{{cite web | title=How nuclear power works |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com | url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-power3.htm | accessdate=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactivity control===
{{main article|Nuclear reactor control|Nuclear reactor physics|Passive nuclear safety|Delayed neutron|Iodine pit|SCRAM|Decay heat}}
The rate of fission reactions within a reactor core can be adjusted by controlling the quantity of neutrons that are able to induce further fission events. Nuclear reactors typically employ several methods of neutron control to adjust the reactor's power output. Some of these methods arising naturally from the physics of radioactive decay and are simply accounted for during the reactor's operation, while others are mechanisms engineered into the reactor design for a distinct purpose.

The fastest method for adjusting levels of fission-inducing neutrons in a reactor is via movement of the [[control rod]]s. Control rods are made of [[neutron poison]]s and therefore tend to absorb neutrons. When a control rod is inserted deeper into the reactor, it absorbs more neutrons than the material it displaces—often the moderator. This action results in fewer neutrons available to cause fission and reduces the reactor's power output. Conversely, extracting the control rod will result in an increase in the rate of fission events and an increase in power.

The physics of radioactive decay also affects neutron populations in a reactor. One such process is [[delayed neutron]] emission by a number of neutron-rich fission isotopes. These delayed neutrons account for about 0.65% of the total neutrons produced in fission, with the remainder (termed "[[prompt neutron]]s") released immediately upon fission. The fission products which produce delayed neutrons have half lives for their [[Radioactive decay|decay]] by [[neutron emission]] that range from milliseconds to as long as several minutes, and so considerable time is required to determine exactly when a reactor reaches the [[critical mass (nuclear)|critical]] point. Keeping the reactor in the zone of chain-reactivity where delayed neutrons are ''necessary'' to achieve a [[critical mass]] state allows mechanical devices or human operators to control a chain reaction in "real time"; otherwise the time between achievement of [[critical mass (nuclear)|criticality]] and [[nuclear meltdown]] as a result of an exponential power surge from the normal nuclear chain reaction, would be too short to allow for intervention. This last stage, where delayed neutrons are no longer required to maintain criticality, is known as the [[prompt critical]] point. There is a scale for describing criticality in numerical form, in which bare criticality is known as ''zero [[dollar (reactivity)|dollars]]'' and the prompt critical point is ''one dollar'', and other points in the process interpolated in cents.

In some reactors, the [[coolant]] also acts as a [[neutron moderator]]. A moderator increases the power of the reactor by causing the fast neutrons that are released from fission to lose energy and become thermal neutrons. [[Thermal neutron]]s are more likely than [[fast neutron]]s to cause fission. If the coolant is a moderator, then temperature changes can affect the density of the coolant/moderator and therefore change power output. A higher temperature coolant would be less dense, and therefore a less effective moderator.

In other reactors the coolant acts as a poison by absorbing neutrons in the same way that the control rods do. In these reactors power output can be increased by heating the coolant, which makes it a less dense poison. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to [[scram]] the reactor in an emergency shut down. These systems insert large amounts of poison (often [[boron]] in the form of [[boric acid]]) into the reactor to shut the fission reaction down if unsafe conditions are detected or anticipated.&lt;ref name="TOURISTRP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Reactor Protection &amp; Engineered Safety Feature Systems |work=The Nuclear Tourist |url= http://www.nucleartourist.com/systems/rp.htm |accessdate=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most types of reactors are sensitive to a process variously known as xenon poisoning, or the [[iodine pit]]. The common [[fission product]] [[Xenon-135]] produced in the fission process acts as a neutron poison that absorbs neutrons and therefore tends to shut the reactor down. Xenon-135 accumulation can be controlled by keeping power levels high enough to destroy it by neutron absorption as fast as it is produced. Fission also produces [[iodine-135]], which in turn decays (with a half-life of 6.57 hours) to new xenon-135. When the reactor is shut down, iodine-135 continues to decay to xenon-135, making restarting the reactor more difficult for a day or two, as the xenon-135 decays into cesium-135, which is not nearly as poisonous as xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.2 hours. This temporary state is the "iodine pit." If the reactor has sufficient extra reactivity capacity, it can be restarted. As the extra xenon-135 is transmuted to xenon-136, which is much less a neutron poison, within a few hours the reactor experiences a "xenon burnoff (power) transient". Control rods must be further inserted to replace the neutron absorption of the lost xenon-135. Failure to properly follow such a procedure was a key step in the [[Chernobyl disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |title=Chernobyl: what happened and why? by CM Meyer, technical journalist. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211073343/http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |archivedate=11 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactors used in [[nuclear marine propulsion]] (especially [[nuclear submarine]]s) often cannot be run at continuous power around the clock in the same way that land-based power reactors are normally run, and in addition often need to have a very long core life without [[Reactor refueling|refueling]]. For this reason many designs use highly enriched uranium but incorporate burnable neutron poison in the fuel rods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tsetkov|first1=Pavel|last2=Usman|first2=Shoaib|editor=Krivit, Steven|title=Nuclear Energy Encyclopedia: Science, Technology, and Applications|year=2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-89439-2|pages=48; 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the reactor to be constructed with an excess of fissionable material, which is nevertheless made relatively safe early in the reactor's fuel burn-cycle by the presence of the neutron-absorbing material which is later replaced by normally produced long-lived neutron poisons (far longer-lived than xenon-135) which gradually accumulate over the fuel load's operating life.

===Electrical power generation===
The energy released in the fission process generates heat, some of which can be converted into usable energy. A common method of harnessing this [[thermal energy]] is to use it to boil water to produce pressurized steam which will then drive a [[steam turbine]] that turns an [[alternator]] and generates electricity.&lt;ref name="TOURISTRP"/&gt;

==Early reactors==
[[File:Stagg Field reactor.jpg|thumb|The [[Chicago Pile-1|Chicago Pile]], the first nuclear reactor, built in secrecy at the University of Chicago in 1942 during World War II as part of the US's [[Manhattan project]]. ]]

{{See also|Nuclear fission#History}}
The [[neutron]] was discovered in 1932 by British physicist [[James Chadwick]]. The concept of a nuclear chain reaction brought about by [[nuclear reaction]]s mediated by neutrons was first realized shortly thereafter, by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] scientist [[Leó Szilárd]], in 1933. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple reactor the following year while working at the [[Admiralty]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;L. Szilárd, [http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=GB630726 "Improvements in or relating to the transmutation of chemical elements,"] British patent number: GB630726 (filed: 28 June 1934; published: 30 March 1936).&lt;/ref&gt; However, Szilárd's idea did not incorporate the idea of nuclear fission as a neutron source, since that process was not yet discovered. Szilárd's ideas for nuclear reactors using neutron-mediated nuclear chain reactions in light elements proved unworkable.
[[File:Otto Hahn und Lise Meitner.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Hahn]] in their laboratory.]]
Inspiration for a new type of reactor using uranium came from the discovery by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Fritz Strassmann]] and [[Otto Hahn]] in 1938 that bombardment of uranium with neutrons (provided by an alpha-on-beryllium fusion reaction, a "[[neutron howitzer]]") produced a [[barium]] residue, which they reasoned was created by the fissioning of the uranium nuclei. Subsequent studies in early 1939 (one of them by Szilárd and Fermi) revealed that several neutrons were also released during the fissioning, making available the opportunity for the nuclear [[chain reaction]] that Szilárd had envisioned six years previously.

On 2 August 1939 [[Albert Einstein]] signed a letter to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (written by Szilárd) suggesting that the discovery of uranium's fission could lead to the development of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type", giving impetus to the study of reactors and fission. Szilárd and Einstein knew each other well and had worked together years previously, but Einstein had never thought about this possibility for nuclear energy until Szilard reported it to him, at the beginning of his quest to produce the [[Einstein-Szilárd letter]] to alert the U.S. government.

Shortly after, [[Hitler]]'s Germany invaded Poland in 1939, starting [[World War II]] in Europe. The U.S. was not yet officially at war, but in October, when the Einstein-Szilárd letter was delivered to him, Roosevelt commented that the purpose of doing the research was to make sure "the Nazis don't blow us up." The U.S. nuclear project followed, although with some delay as there remained skepticism (some of it from Fermi) and also little action from the small number of officials in the government who were initially charged with moving the project forward.

The following year the U.S. Government received the [[Frisch–Peierls memorandum]] from the UK, which stated that the amount of [[uranium]] needed for a [[chain reaction]] was far lower than had previously been thought. The memorandum was a product of the [[MAUD Committee]], which was working on the UK atomic bomb project, known as [[Tube Alloys]], later [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|to be subsumed]] within the [[Manhattan Project]].
[[File:ChicagoPileTeam.png|right|thumb|Some of the [[Chicago Pile-1|Chicago Pile Team]], including [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Leó Szilárd]].]]

Eventually, the first artificial nuclear reactor, [[Chicago Pile-1]], was constructed at the [[University of Chicago]], by a team led by [[Italians|Italian]] physicist [[Enrico Fermi]], in late 1942. By this time, the program had been pressured for a year by U.S. entry into the war. The Chicago Pile achieved [[critical mass|criticality]] on 2 December 1942&lt;ref&gt;The First Reactor, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Division of Technical Information&lt;/ref&gt; at 3:25&amp;nbsp;PM. The reactor support structure was made of wood, which supported a pile (hence the name) of graphite blocks, embedded in which was natural uranium-oxide 'pseudospheres' or 'briquettes'.

Soon after the Chicago Pile, the U.S. military developed a number of nuclear reactors for the [[Manhattan Project]] starting in 1943. The primary purpose for the largest reactors (located at the [[Hanford Site]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]), was the mass production of [[plutonium]] for nuclear weapons. Fermi and Szilard applied for a patent on reactors on 19 December 1944. Its issuance was delayed for 10&amp;nbsp;years because of wartime secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico, Fermi and Leo, Szilard {{US Patent|2708656}} "Neutronic Reactor" issued 17 May 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

"World's first nuclear power plant" is the claim made by signs at the site of the [[EBR-I]], which is now a museum near [[Arco, Idaho]]. Originally called "Chicago Pile-4", it was carried out under the direction of [[Walter Zinn]] for [[Argonne National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/hn/news960320.shtml|title=Chicago Pile reactors create enduring research legacy –  Argonne's Historical News Releases|work=anl.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experimental [[LMFBR]] operated by the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] produced 0.8&amp;nbsp;kW in a test on 20 December 1951&lt;ref&gt;[https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_200_816_259_0_43/http%3B/inlpublisher%3B7087/publishedcontent/publish/communities/inl_gov/about_inl/home_page_fact_sheets/sheets/experimental_breeder_reactor___i_4.pdf Experimental Breeder Reactor 1 factsheet], Idaho National Laboratory {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029200744/https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_200_816_259_0_43/http%3B/inlpublisher%3B7087/publishedcontent/publish/communities/inl_gov/about_inl/home_page_fact_sheets/sheets/experimental_breeder_reactor___i_4.pdf |date=29 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 100&amp;nbsp;kW (electrical) the following day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ans.org/pubs/magazines/nn/docs/2001-11-2.pdf | title=Fifty years ago in December: Atomic reactor EBR-I produced first electricity | publisher=American Nuclear Society Nuclear news | date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; having a design output of 200&amp;nbsp;kW (electrical).

Besides the military uses of nuclear reactors, there were political reasons to pursue civilian use of atomic energy. U.S. President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] made his famous [[Atoms for Peace]] speech to the [[UN General Assembly]] on 8 December 1953. This diplomacy led to the dissemination of reactor technology to U.S. institutions and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/the-nuclear-option.html|title=The Nuclear Option — NOVA {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first nuclear power plant built for civil purposes was the AM-1 [[Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant]], launched on 27 June 1954 in the [[Soviet Union]]. It produced around 5&amp;nbsp;MW (electrical).

After World War II, the U.S. military sought other uses for nuclear reactor technology. Research by the Army and the Air Force never came to fruition; however, the U.S. Navy succeeded when they steamed the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'']] (SSN-571) on nuclear power 17 January 1955.

The first commercial nuclear power station, [[Calder Hall nuclear power station|Calder Hall]] in [[Sellafield]], England was opened in 1956 with an initial capacity of 50 MW (later 200 MW).&lt;ref name=Kragh&gt;{{cite book |last=Kragh|first=Helge |title=Quantum Generations: A History of Physics in the Twentieth Century |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton NJ |year=1999 |page=286 |isbn=0-691-09552-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc17oct"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/17/newsid_3147000/3147145.stm |title=On This Day: 17&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;|accessdate=9 November 2006 |publisher=BBC News | date=17 October 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classifications===
Nuclear Reactors are classified by several methods; a brief outline of these classification methods is provided.

====Classification by type of nuclear reaction====

=====[[Nuclear fission]]=====
All commercial power reactors are based on nuclear fission. They generally use [[uranium]] and its product [[plutonium]] as [[nuclear fuel]], though a [[thorium fuel cycle]] is also possible. Fission reactors can be divided roughly into two classes, depending on the energy of the neutrons that sustain the fission [[chain reaction]]:
* [[Thermal reactor]]s (the most common type of nuclear reactor) use slowed or [[thermal neutron]]s to keep up the fission of their fuel. Almost all current reactors are of this type. These contain [[neutron moderator]] materials that slow neutrons until their [[neutron temperature]] is ''thermalized'', that is, until their [[kinetic energy]] approaches the average kinetic energy of the surrounding particles. Thermal neutrons have a far higher [[Nuclear cross section|cross-section]] (probability) of fissioning the [[fissile]] nuclei [[uranium-235]], [[plutonium-239]], and [[plutonium-241]], and a relatively lower probability of [[neutron capture]] by [[uranium-238]] (U-238) compared to the faster neutrons that originally result from fission, allowing use of [[low-enriched uranium]] or even [[natural uranium]] fuel. The moderator is often also the [[coolant]], usually water under high pressure to increase the [[boiling point]]. These are surrounded by a [[reactor vessel]], instrumentation to monitor and control the reactor, [[radiation shielding]], and a [[containment building]].
* [[Fast neutron reactor]]s use [[fast neutron]]s to cause fission in their fuel. They do not have a [[neutron moderator]], and use less-moderating coolants. Maintaining a chain reaction requires the fuel to be more highly [[isotope separation|enriched]] in [[fissile]] material (about 20% or more) due to the relatively lower probability of fission versus capture by U-238. Fast reactors have the potential to produce less [[transuranic]] waste because all [[actinides]] are fissionable with fast neutrons,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00750983| title = Fast-reactor actinoid transmutation| journal = Atomic Energy| volume = 74| page = 83| year = 1993| last1 = Golubev | first1 = V.

M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are more difficult to build and more expensive to operate. Overall, fast reactors are less common than thermal reactors in most applications. Some early power stations were fast reactors, as are some Russian naval propulsion units. Construction of prototypes is continuing (see [[fast breeder]] or [[Generation IV reactor#Fast reactors|generation IV reactors]]).

====Classification by moderator material====
Used by thermal reactors:
* [[Graphite-moderated reactor]]s
* Water moderated reactors
** [[Heavy-water reactor]]s (Used in Canada&lt;ref name="hyperphysics"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nave|first1=R|title=Light Water Nuclear Reactors|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/NucEne/ligwat.html |website=Hyperphysics |publisher = Georgia State University|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, India, Argentina, China, Pakistan, Romania and South Korea).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
** [[Light-water reactor|Light-water-moderated reactors]] (LWRs). Light-water reactors (the most common type of thermal reactor) use ordinary water to moderate and cool the reactors.&lt;ref name ="hyperphysics"/&gt; When at [[operating temperature]], if the temperature of the water increases, its density drops, and fewer neutrons passing through it are slowed enough to trigger further reactions. That [[negative feedback]] stabilizes the reaction rate. Graphite and heavy-water reactors tend to be more thoroughly thermalized than light water reactors. Due to the extra thermalization, these types can use [[natural uranium]]/unenriched fuel.
* Light-element-moderated reactors.
** [[Molten salt reactor]]s (MSRs) are moderated by light elements such as lithium or beryllium, which are constituents of the coolant/fuel matrix salts LiF and BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
** [[Liquid metal cooled reactor]]s, such as those whose coolant is a mixture of lead and bismuth, may use BeO as a moderator.
* Organically moderated reactors (OMR) use [[biphenyl]] and [[terphenyl]] as moderator and coolant.

====Classification by coolant====

[[File:Thermal reactor diagram.png|thumb|right|In thermal nuclear reactors (LWRs in specific), the coolant acts as a moderator that must slow down the neutrons before they can be efficiently absorbed by the fuel.]]
* Water cooled reactor. There are 104 operating reactors in the United States. Of these, 69 are pressurized water reactors (PWR), and 35 are boiling water reactors (BWR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nei.org/resourcesandstats/nuclear_statistics/usnuclearpowerplants/  | archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20081022204008/http://www.nei.org/resourcesandstats/nuclear_statistics/usnuclearpowerplants/  | dead-url=yes  | archive-date=22 October 2008  | title=U.S. Nuclear Power Plants. General Statistical Information | publisher=Nuclear Energy Institute | accessdate=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) Pressurized water reactors constitute the large majority of all Western nuclear power plants.
*** A primary characteristic of PWRs is a pressurizer, a specialized [[pressure vessel]]. Most commercial PWRs and naval reactors use pressurizers. During normal operation, a pressurizer is partially filled with water, and a steam bubble is maintained above it by heating the water with submerged heaters. During normal operation, the pressurizer is connected to the primary reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and the pressurizer "bubble" provides an expansion space for changes in water volume in the reactor. This arrangement also provides a means of pressure control for the reactor by increasing or decreasing the steam pressure in the pressurizer using the pressurizer heaters.
*** [[Pressurised heavy water reactor]]s are a subset of pressurized water reactors, sharing the use of a pressurized, isolated heat transport loop, but using [[heavy water]] as coolant and moderator for the greater neutron economies it offers.
** [[Boiling water reactor]] (BWR)
*** BWRs are characterized by boiling water around the fuel rods in the lower portion of a primary reactor pressure vessel. A boiling water reactor uses &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U, enriched as uranium dioxide, as its fuel. The fuel is assembled into rods housed in a steel vessel that is submerged in water. The nuclear fission causes the water to boil, generating steam. This steam flows through pipes into turbines. The turbines are driven by the steam, and this process generates electricity.&lt;ref name="nuclear_energy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lipper |first1=Ilan |first2=Jon |last2=Stone |url=http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/nuclear.htm |title=Nuclear Energy and Society |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=3 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401172451/http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/nuclear.htm |archivedate=1 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During normal operation, pressure is controlled by the amount of steam flowing from the reactor pressure vessel to the turbine.
** [[Pool-type reactor]]
* [[Liquid metal cooled reactor]]. Since water is a moderator, it cannot be used as a coolant in a fast reactor. Liquid metal coolants have included [[sodium]], [[NaK]], lead, [[lead-bismuth eutectic]], and in early reactors, [[mercury (element)|mercury]].
** [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor]]
** [[Lead-cooled fast reactor]]
* [[Gas cooled reactor]]s are cooled by a circulating inert gas, often [[helium]] in high-temperature designs, while [[carbon dioxide]] has been used in past British and French nuclear power plants. [[Nitrogen]] has also been used.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Utilization of the heat varies, depending on the reactor. Some reactors run hot enough that the gas can directly power a gas turbine. Older designs usually run the gas through a [[heat exchanger]] to make steam for a steam turbine.
* [[Molten salt reactor]]s (MSRs) are cooled by circulating a molten salt, typically a eutectic mixture of fluoride salts, such as [[FLiBe]]. In a typical MSR, the coolant is also used as a matrix in which the fissile material is dissolved.

====Classification by generation====
* [[Generation I reactor]] (early prototypes, research reactors, non-commercial power producing reactors)
* [[Generation II reactor]] (most current [[nuclear power plant]]s 1965–1996)
* [[Generation III reactor]] (evolutionary improvements of existing designs 1996-present)
* [[Generation IV reactor]] (technologies still under development{{says_who|date=September 2018}} unknown start date, possibly 2030)

In 2003, the French [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique]] (CEA) was the first to refer to "Gen II" types in Nucleonics Week.&lt;ref&gt;Nucleonics Week, Vol. 44, No. 39; p. 7, 25 September 2003 Quote: "Etienne Pochon, CEA director of nuclear industry support, outlined EPR's improved performance and enhanced safety features compared to the advanced Generation II designs on which it was based."&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mentioning of "Gen III" was in 2000, in conjunction with the launch of the [[Generation IV reactor#Generation IV International Forum|Generation IV International Forum]] (GIF) plans.

"Gen IV" was named in 2000, by the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) for developing new plant types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronuclear.org/info/generation-IV.htm |title=Generation IV |publisher=Euronuclear.org |accessdate=18 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317125012/http://www.euronuclear.org/info/generation-IV.htm |archivedate=17 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current technologies===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
[[File:Diablo canyon nuclear power plant.jpg|thumb|[[Diablo Canyon Power Plant|Diablo Canyon]] — a PWR]]
* [[Pressurized water reactor]]s (PWR)
:: These reactors use a pressure vessel to contain the nuclear fuel, control rods, moderator, and coolant. They are cooled and moderated by high-pressure liquid water. The hot radioactive water that leaves the pressure vessel is looped through a steam generator, which in turn heats a secondary (non-radioactive) loop of water to steam that can run turbines. They are the majority of current reactors. This is a [[thermal neutron]] reactor design, the newest of which are the [[VVER-1200]], [[Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor]] and the [[European Pressurized Reactor]]. [[United States Naval reactor]]s are of this type.
* [[Boiling water reactor]]s (BWR)
:: A BWR is like a PWR without the steam generator. A boiling water reactor is cooled and moderated by water like a PWR, but at a lower pressure, which allows the water to boil inside the pressure vessel producing the steam that runs the turbines. Unlike a PWR, there is no primary and secondary loop. The thermal efficiency of these reactors can be higher, and they can be simpler, and even potentially more stable and safe. This is a thermal neutron reactor design, the newest of which are the [[Advanced Boiling Water Reactor]] and the [[Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor]].
[[File:CANDU at Qinshan.jpg|thumb|The [[CANDU]] [[Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant]]]]
* [[Pressurised heavy water reactor|Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor]] (PHWR)
:: A Canadian design (known as [[CANDU]]), these reactors are [[heavy water|heavy-water]]-cooled and -moderated pressurized-water reactors. Instead of using a single large pressure vessel as in a PWR, the fuel is contained in hundreds of pressure tubes. These reactors are fueled with natural [[uranium]] and are thermal neutron reactor designs. PHWRs can be refueled while at full power, which makes them very efficient in their use of uranium (it allows for precise flux control in the core). CANDU PHWRs have been built in Canada, [[Argentina]], China, [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Romania]], and [[South Korea]]. India also operates a number of PHWRs, often termed 'CANDU-derivatives', built after the Government of Canada halted nuclear dealings with India following the 1974 [[Smiling Buddha]] nuclear weapon test.
:[[File:Elektrownia Ignalina.jpg|thumb|The [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]] — a RBMK type (closed 2009)]]
* Reaktor Bolshoy Moschnosti Kanalniy (High Power Channel Reactor) ([[RBMK]])
:: A Soviet design, built to produce plutonium as well as power. RBMKs are water cooled with a [[graphite]] moderator. RBMKs are in some respects similar to CANDU in that they are refuelable during power operation and employ a pressure tube design instead of a PWR-style pressure vessel. However, unlike CANDU they are very unstable and large, making [[containment building]]s for them expensive. A series of critical safety flaws have also been identified with the RBMK design, though some of these were corrected following the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Their main attraction is their use of light water and un-enriched uranium. As of 2010, 11 remain open, mostly due to safety improvements and help from international safety agencies such as the DOE. Despite these safety improvements, RBMK reactors are still considered one of the most dangerous reactor designs in use. RBMK reactors were deployed only in the former [[Soviet Union]].
[[File:Sizewell A.jpg|thumb|The [[Magnox]] [[Sizewell A]] nuclear power station]]
[[File:Torness Nuclear Power Station, Scotland.JPG|thumb|The [[Torness nuclear power station]] — an AGR]]
* [[Gas-cooled reactor]] (GCR) and [[advanced gas-cooled reactor]] (AGR)
:: These are generally graphite moderated and [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] cooled. They can have a high thermal efficiency compared with PWRs due to higher operating temperatures. There are a number of operating reactors of this design, mostly in the United Kingdom, where the concept was developed. Older designs (i.e. [[Magnox]] stations) are either shut down or will be in the near future. However, the AGCRs have an anticipated life of a further 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;years. This is a thermal neutron reactor design. Decommissioning costs can be high due to large volume of reactor core.
* [[Breeder reactor|Liquid-metal]] [[Fast breeder reactor#Fast breeder reactor|fast-breeder reactor]] (LMFBR)
[[File:Topaz nuclear reactor.jpg|thumb|right| Scaled - down model of [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor]]]]
:: This is a reactor design that is cooled by liquid metal, totally unmoderated, and produces more fuel than it consumes. They are said to "breed" fuel, because they produce fissionable fuel during operation because of [[neutron capture]]. These reactors can function much like a PWR in terms of efficiency, and do not require much high-pressure containment, as the liquid metal does not need to be kept at high pressure, even at very high temperatures. [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor]],[[BN-350]] and[[BN-600]] in USSR and [[Superphénix]] in France were a reactor of this type, as was [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station|Fermi-I]] in the United States. The [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant|Monju reactor]] in Japan suffered a sodium leak in 1995 and was [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant#Restart|restarted]] in May 2010. All of them use/used liquid [[sodium]]. These reactors are [[fast neutron]], not thermal neutron designs. These reactors come in two types:
[[File:Superphénix.jpg|thumb|The [[Superphénix]], one of the few FBRs]]
::: [[Lead-cooled fast reactor|Lead-cooled]]
:::: Using lead as the liquid metal provides excellent radiation shielding, and allows for operation at very high temperatures. Also, lead is (mostly) transparent to neutrons, so fewer neutrons are lost in the coolant, and the coolant does not become radioactive. Unlike sodium, lead is mostly inert, so there is less risk of explosion or accident, but such large quantities of lead may be problematic from toxicology and disposal points of view. Often a reactor of this type would use a [[lead-bismuth eutectic]] mixture. In this case, the bismuth would present some minor radiation problems, as it is not quite as transparent to neutrons, and can be transmuted to a radioactive isotope more readily than lead. The Russian [[Alfa class submarine]] uses a lead-bismuth-cooled fast reactor as its main power plant.
::: [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor|Sodium-cooled]]
:::: Most LMFBRs are of this type. The sodium is relatively easy to obtain and work with, and it also manages to actually prevent corrosion on the various reactor parts immersed in it. However, sodium explodes violently when exposed to water, so care must be taken, but such explosions would not be vastly more violent than (for example) a leak of superheated fluid from a [[Supercritical water reactor|SCWR]] or PWR. [[EBR-I]], the first reactor to have a core meltdown, was of this type.
* [[Pebble-bed reactor]]s (PBR)
:: These use fuel molded into ceramic balls, and then circulate gas through the balls. The result is an efficient, low-maintenance, very safe reactor with inexpensive, standardized fuel. The prototype was the [[AVR reactor|AVR]].
* [[Molten salt reactor]]s
::These dissolve the fuels in [[fluoride]] salts, or use fluoride salts for coolant. These have many safety features, high efficiency and a high power density suitable for vehicles. Notably, they have no high pressures or flammable components in the core. The prototype was the [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment|MSRE]], which also used the Thorium [[fuel cycle]]. As a breeder reactor type, it reprocesses the spent fuel, extracting both Uranium and transuranics, leaving [[Liquid fluoride thorium reactor|only 0.1% of transuranic waste]] compared to conventional once-through uranium-fueled light water reactors currently in use. A separate issue is the radioactive fission products, which are not reprocessable and need to be disposed of as with conventional reactors.
* [[Aqueous Homogeneous Reactor]] (AHR)
:: These reactors use soluble nuclear salts dissolved in water and mixed with a coolant and a [[neutron moderator]].

===Future and developing technologies===

====Advanced reactors====
More than a dozen advanced reactor designs are in various stages of development.&lt;ref name="UIC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Advanced Nuclear Power Reactors |publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] |url= http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf08.html |accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are evolutionary from the [[pressurized water reactor|PWR]], [[boiling water reactor|BWR]] and [[Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor|PHWR]] designs above, some are more radical departures. The former include the [[advanced boiling water reactor]] (ABWR), two of which are now operating with others under construction, and the planned [[passively safe]] [[Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor]] (ESBWR) and [[AP1000]] units (see [[Nuclear Power 2010 Program]]).
* The [[Integral Fast Reactor]] (IFR) was built, tested and evaluated during the 1980s and then retired under the Clinton administration in the 1990s due to nuclear non-proliferation policies of the administration. Recycling spent fuel is the core of its design and it therefore produces only a fraction of the waste of current reactors.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/reaction/interviews/till.html |title=Nuclear Reaction: Why Do Americans Fear Nuclear Power? |accessdate=9 November 2006 |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) |author=Till, Charles }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[pebble-bed reactor]], a [[high-temperature gas-cooled reactor]] (HTGCR), is designed so high temperatures reduce power output by [[Doppler broadening]] of the fuel's neutron cross-section. It uses ceramic fuels so its safe operating temperatures exceed the power-reduction temperature range. Most designs are cooled by inert helium. Helium is not subject to steam explosions, resists neutron absorption leading to radioactivity, and does not dissolve contaminants that can become radioactive. Typical designs have more layers (up to 7) of passive containment than light water reactors (usually&amp;nbsp;3). A unique feature that may aid safety is that the fuel-balls actually form the core's mechanism, and are replaced one-by-one as they age. The design of the fuel makes fuel reprocessing expensive.
* The [[Small, sealed, transportable, autonomous reactor]] (SSTAR) is being primarily researched and developed in the US, intended as a fast breeder reactor that is passively safe and could be remotely shut down in case the suspicion arises that it is being tampered with.
* The [[Clean And Environmentally Safe Advanced Reactor]] (CAESAR) is a nuclear reactor concept that uses steam as a moderator – this design is still in development.
* The [[Reduced moderation water reactor]] builds upon the [[Advanced boiling water reactor]](ABWR) that is presently in use, it is not a complete fast reactor instead using mostly [[epithermal neutron]]s, which are between thermal and fast neutrons in speed.
* The [[hydrogen-moderated self-regulating nuclear power module]] (HPM) is a reactor design emanating from the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] that uses [[uranium hydride]] as fuel.
* [[Subcritical reactor]]s are designed to be safer and more stable, but pose a number of engineering and economic difficulties. One example is the [[Energy amplifier]].
* Thorium-based reactors. It is possible to convert Thorium-232 into U-233 in reactors specially designed for the purpose. In this way, thorium, which is four times more abundant than uranium, can be used to breed U-233 nuclear fuel.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Juhasz|first1=Albert J.|last2=Rarick|first2=Richard A.|last3=Rangarajan|first3=Rajmohan|title=High Efficiency Nuclear Power Plants Using Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor Technology|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090038711.pdf|website=NASA|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; U-233 is also believed to have favourable nuclear properties as compared to traditionally used U-235, including better neutron economy and lower production of long lived transuranic waste.
** [[Advanced heavy-water reactor]] (AHWR)— A proposed heavy water moderated nuclear power reactor that will be the next generation design of the PHWR type. Under development in the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] (BARC), India.
** [[KAMINI]] — A unique reactor using Uranium-233 isotope for fuel. Built in India by [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre|BARC]] and Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research ([[IGCAR]]).
** India is also planning to build fast breeder reactors using the thorium – Uranium-233 fuel cycle. The FBTR (Fast Breeder Test Reactor) in operation at [[Kalpakkam]] (India) uses Plutonium as a fuel and liquid sodium as a coolant.

====Generation IV reactors====
[[Generation IV reactors]] are a set of theoretical nuclear reactor designs currently being researched. These designs are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030. Current reactors in operation around the world are generally considered second- or third-generation systems, with the first-generation systems having been retired some time ago. Research into these reactor types was officially started by the Generation&amp;nbsp;IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals. The primary goals being to improve nuclear safety, improve proliferation resistance, minimize waste and natural resource utilization, and to decrease the cost to build and run such plants.&lt;ref name="UIC1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Generation IV Nuclear Reactors |publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] |url= http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf77.html |accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gas-cooled fast reactor]]
* [[Lead-cooled fast reactor]]
* [[Molten salt reactor]]
* [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor]]
* [[Supercritical water reactor]]
* [[Very-high-temperature reactor]]

====Generation V+ reactors====
Generation V reactors are designs which are theoretically possible, but which are not being actively considered or researched at present. Though such reactors could be built with current or near term technology, they trigger little interest for reasons of economics, practicality, or safety.
* Liquid-core reactor. A closed loop [[Nuclear thermal rocket#Liquid core|liquid-core nuclear reactor]], where the fissile material is molten uranium or uranium solution cooled by a working gas pumped in through holes in the base of the containment vessel.
* [[Gaseous fission reactor|Gas-core reactor]]. A closed loop version of the [[Nuclear lightbulb|nuclear lightbulb rocket]], where the fissile material is gaseous uranium-hexafluoride contained in a fused silica vessel. A working gas (such as hydrogen) would flow around this vessel and absorb the UV light produced by the reaction. This reactor design could also function [[Gas core reactor rocket|as a rocket engine]], as featured in Harry Harrison's 1976 science-fiction novel ''Skyfall''. In theory, using UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; as a working fuel directly (rather than as a stage to one, as is done now) would mean lower processing costs, and very small reactors. In practice, running a reactor at such high power densities would probably produce unmanageable [[neutron flux]], weakening most [[IFMIF|reactor materials]], and therefore as the flux would be similar to that expected in fusion reactors, it would require similar materials to those selected by the [[IFMIF|International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility]].
** Gas core EM reactor. As in the gas core reactor, but with [[photovoltaic]] arrays converting the [[UV light]] directly to electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isjaee.hydrogen.ru/pdf/AEE04-07_Prelas.pdf |title=International Scientific Journal for Alternative Energy and Ecology, DIRECT CONVERSION OF NUCLEAR ENERGY TO ELECTRICITY, Mark A. Prelas |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024833/http://isjaee.hydrogen.ru/pdf/AEE04-07_Prelas.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is similar to the experimentally proved [[photoelectric effect]] that would convert the X-rays generated from [[aneutronic fusion]] into electricity, by passing the high energy photons through an array of conducting foils to transfer some of their energy to electrons, the energy of the photon is captured electrostatically, similar to a [[capacitor]]. Since X-rays can go through far greater material thickness than electrons, many hundreds or thousands of layers are needed to absorb the X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;Quimby, D.C., High Thermal Efficiency X-ray energy conversion scheme for advanced fusion reactors, ASTM Special technical Publication, v.2, 1977, pp. 1161–1165&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fission fragment reactor]]. A fission fragment reactor is a nuclear reactor that generates electricity by decelerating an ion beam of fission byproducts instead of using nuclear reactions to generate heat. By doing so, it bypasses the [[Carnot cycle]] and can achieve efficiencies of up to 90% instead of 40–45% attainable by efficient turbine-driven thermal reactors. The fission fragment ion beam would be passed through a [[magnetohydrodynamic generator]] to produce electricity.
* [[Hybrid nuclear fusion]]. Would use the neutrons emitted by fusion to fission a [[breeder reactor|blanket]] of [[fertile material]], like [[Uranium-238|U-238]] or [[thorium|Th-232]] and [[Nuclear transmutation|transmute]] other reactor's [[spent nuclear fuel]]/nuclear waste into relatively more benign isotopes.

====Fusion reactors====
{{Main article|Fusion power}}
Controlled [[nuclear fusion]] could in principle be used in [[fusion power]] plants to produce power without the complexities of handling [[actinides]], but significant scientific and technical obstacles remain. Several fusion reactors have been built, but only recently reactors have been able to release more energy than the amount of energy used in the process. Despite research having started in the 1950s, no commercial fusion reactor is expected before 2050. The [[ITER]] project is currently leading the effort to harness fusion power.

==Nuclear fuel cycle==
{{Main article|Nuclear fuel cycle}}
Thermal reactors generally depend on refined and [[enriched uranium]]. Some nuclear reactors can operate with a mixture of plutonium and uranium (see [[MOX]]). The process by which uranium ore is mined, processed, enriched, used, possibly [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessed]] and disposed of is known as the [[nuclear fuel cycle]].

Under 1% of the uranium found in nature is the easily fissionable U-235 [[isotope]] and as a result most reactor designs require enriched fuel.
Enrichment involves increasing the percentage of U-235 and is usually done by means of [[gaseous diffusion]] or [[gas centrifuge]]. The enriched result is then converted into [[uranium dioxide]] powder, which is pressed and fired into pellet form. These pellets are stacked into tubes which are then sealed and called [[Nuclear fuel|fuel rods]]. Many of these fuel rods are used in each nuclear reactor.

Most BWR and PWR commercial reactors use uranium enriched to about 4% U-235, and some commercial reactors with a high [[neutron economy]] do not require the fuel to be enriched at all (that is, they can use natural uranium). According to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] there are at least 100 [[research reactor]]s in the world fueled by highly enriched (weapons-grade/90% enrichment uranium). Theft risk of this fuel (potentially used in the production of a nuclear weapon) has led to campaigns advocating conversion of this type of reactor to low-enrichment uranium (which poses less threat of proliferation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=IAEA | url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2006/heu_symposium.html | title=Improving Security at World's Nuclear Research Reactors: Technical and Other Issues Focus of June Symposium in Norway | date=7 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fissile]] U-235 and non-fissile but [[fissionable]] and [[Fertile material|fertile]] U-238 are both used in the fission process. U-235 is fissionable by thermal (i.e. slow-moving) neutrons. A thermal neutron is one which is moving about the same speed as the atoms around it. Since all atoms vibrate proportionally to their absolute temperature, a thermal neutron has the best opportunity to fission U-235 when it is moving at this same vibrational speed. On the other hand, U-238 is more likely to capture a neutron when the neutron is moving very fast. This U-239 atom will soon decay into plutonium-239, which is another fuel. Pu-239 is a viable fuel and must be accounted for even when a highly enriched uranium fuel is used. Plutonium fissions will dominate the U-235 fissions in some reactors, especially after the initial loading of U-235 is spent. Plutonium is fissionable with both fast and thermal neutrons, which make it ideal for either nuclear reactors or nuclear bombs.

Most reactor designs in existence are thermal reactors and typically use water as a neutron moderator (moderator means that it slows down the neutron to a thermal speed) and as a coolant. But in a [[fast breeder reactor]], some other kind of coolant is used which will not moderate or slow the neutrons down much. This enables fast neutrons to dominate, which can effectively be used to constantly replenish the fuel supply. By merely placing cheap unenriched uranium into such a core, the non-fissionable U-238 will be turned into Pu-239, "breeding" fuel.

In [[thorium fuel cycle]] [[thorium-232]] absorbs a [[neutron]] in either a fast or thermal reactor. The thorium-233 [[beta decay]]s to [[protactinium]]-233 and then to [[uranium-233]], which in turn is used as fuel. Hence, like [[uranium-238]], thorium-232 is a [[fertile material]].

===Fueling of nuclear reactors===
The amount of energy in the reservoir of [[nuclear fuel]] is frequently expressed in terms of "full-power days," which is the number of 24-hour periods (days) a reactor is scheduled for operation at full power output for the generation of heat energy. The number of full-power days in a reactor's operating cycle (between refueling outage times) is related to the amount of [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] (U-235) contained in the fuel assemblies at the beginning of the cycle. A higher percentage of U-235 in the core at the beginning of a cycle will permit the reactor to be run for a greater number of full-power days.

At the end of the operating cycle, the fuel in some of the assemblies is "spent" and is discharged and replaced with new (fresh) fuel assemblies, although in practice it is the buildup of [[Neutron poison|reaction poisons]] in nuclear fuel that determines the lifetime of nuclear fuel in a reactor. Long before all possible fission has taken place, the buildup of long-lived neutron absorbing fission byproducts impedes the chain reaction. The fraction of the reactor's fuel core replaced during refueling is typically one-fourth for a boiling-water reactor and one-third for a pressurized-water reactor. The disposition and storage of this spent fuel is one of the most challenging aspects of the operation of a commercial nuclear power plant. This nuclear waste is highly radioactive and its toxicity presents a danger for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="nuclear_energy"/&gt;

Not all reactors need to be shut down for refueling; for example, [[pebble bed reactor]]s, [[RBMK|RBMK reactors]], [[molten salt reactor]]s, [[Magnox]], [[Advanced gas-cooled reactor|AGR]] and [[CANDU]] reactors allow fuel to be shifted through the reactor while it is running. In a CANDU reactor, this also allows individual fuel elements to be situated within the reactor core that are best suited to the amount of U-235 in the fuel element.

The amount of energy extracted from nuclear fuel is called its [[burnup]], which is expressed in terms of the heat energy produced per initial unit of fuel weight. Burn up is commonly expressed as megawatt days thermal per metric ton of initial heavy metal.

==Nuclear safety concerns and controversy==
{{Main article|Nuclear safety}}
Nuclear safety covers the actions taken to prevent [[nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents]] or to limit their consequences. The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed new safer (but generally untested) reactor designs but there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly.&lt;ref name=globen/&gt; Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at [[Timeline of the Fukushima nuclear accidents|Fukushima]] in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |title=The lessons of Fukushima  |author=Gusterson, Hugh  |date=16 March 2011  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606023005/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |archivedate=6 June 2013  |df=dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite multiple warnings by the NRG and the Japanese nuclear safety administration.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} According to [[UBS]] AG, the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |title=Fukushima Crisis Worse for Atomic Power Than Chernobyl, UBS Says |author=Paton, James |date=4 April 2011 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515064305/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |archivedate=15 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable.&lt;ref name=globen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/WWSEnergyPolicyPtI.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z.  |author2=Delucchi, Mark A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy |page=6 }}{{dead link|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interdisciplinary team from [[MIT]] has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005–2055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuclearpower-full.pdf |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |author=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=2003 |page=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear reactors have been launched into Earth orbit at least 34 times. A number of incidents connected with the unmanned nuclear-reactor-powered Soviet [[RORSAT]] radar satellite program resulted in spent nuclear fuel re-entering the Earth's atmosphere from orbit.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Natural nuclear reactors==
{{Main article|Natural nuclear fission reactor}}
Although nuclear fission reactors are often thought of as being solely a product of modern technology, the first nuclear fission reactors were in fact naturally occurring. A [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] can occur under certain circumstances that mimic the conditions in a constructed reactor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2334857802602777622 Video of physics lecture] – at Google Video; a natural nuclear reactor is mentioned at 42:40 mins into the video {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060804021811/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2334857802602777622 |date=4 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen natural fission reactors have so far been found in three separate ore deposits at the [[Oklo]] uranium mine in [[Gabon]], West Africa. First discovered in 1972 by French physicist [[Francis Perrin]], they are collectively known as the [[Natural nuclear fission reactor|Oklo Fossil Reactors]]. Self-sustaining [[nuclear fission]] reactions took place in these reactors approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, and ran for a few hundred thousand years, averaging 100&amp;nbsp;kW of power output during that time.&lt;ref&gt;Meshik, Alex P. (November 2005) [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ancient-nuclear-reactor/ "The Workings of an Ancient Nuclear Reactor."] ''Scientific American.'' p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a natural nuclear reactor was theorized as early as 1956 by [[Paul Kuroda]] at the [[University of Arkansas]].&lt;ref name="OCRWM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oklo: Natural Nuclear Reactors |work=Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management |url=http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/factsheets/doeymp0010.shtml |accessdate=28 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316101947/http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/factsheets/doeymp0010.shtml |archivedate=16 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANS1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Oklo's Natural Fission Reactors |work=[[American Nuclear Society]] |url= http://www.ans.org/pi/np/oklo |accessdate=28 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such reactors can no longer form on Earth in its present geologic period. Radioactive decay of formerly abundant uranium-235 over the time span of hundreds of millions of years has reduced the proportion of this naturally occurring fissile isotope to below the amount required to sustain a chain reaction.

The natural nuclear reactors formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became inundated with groundwater that acted as a neutron moderator, and a strong chain reaction took place. The water moderator would boil away as the reaction increased, slowing it back down again and preventing a meltdown. The fission reaction was sustained for hundreds of thousands of years.

These natural reactors are extensively studied by scientists interested in geologic radioactive waste disposal. They offer a case study of how radioactive isotopes migrate through the Earth's crust. This is a significant area of controversy as opponents of geologic waste disposal fear that isotopes from stored waste could end up in water supplies or be carried into the environment.

== Emissions ==
Nuclear reactors produce [[tritium]] as part of normal operations, which is eventually released into the environment in trace quantities.

As an [[isotope]] of [[hydrogen]], tritium (T) frequently binds to oxygen and forms [[tritiated water|T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]. This molecule is chemically identical to [[water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] and so is both colorless and odorless, however the additional neutrons in the hydrogen nuclei cause the tritium to undergo [[beta decay]] with a [[half-life]] of 12.3 years. Despite being measurable, the tritium released by nuclear power plants is minimal. The United States [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]] estimates that a person drinking water for one year out of a well contaminated by what they would consider to be a significant tritiated water spill would receive a radiation dose of 0.3 millirem.&lt;ref name=NRC_Tritium_Backgrounder&gt;{{cite report|date=February 2016|title=Backgrounder: Tritium, Radiation Protection Limits, and Drinking Water Standards|url=https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0620/ML062020079.pdf|publisher=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission|access-date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, this is an order of magnitude less than the 4 millirem a person receives on a round trip flight from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, a consequence of less atmospheric protection against highly energetic [[cosmic ray]]s at high altitudes.&lt;ref name=NRC_Tritium_Backgrounder /&gt;

The amounts of [[strontium-90]] released from nuclear power plants under normal operations is so low as to be undetectable above natural background radiation. Detectable strontium-90 in ground water and the general environment can be traced to weapons testing and the Chernobyl accident that occurred during the mid-[[20th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radionuclides in Groundwater|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/ops-experience/tritium/rn-groundwater.html|website=U.S. NRC|publisher=nrc.gov|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use South African English|date=November 2013}}'''Otto Walter Heinrich Oscar Brune''' (10 January 1901 – 1982) undertook some key investigations into [[Network synthesis filter|network synthesis]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) where he graduated in 1929.&lt;ref name=Seising/&gt;  His doctoral thesis was supervised by [[Wilhelm Cauer]] (and [[Ernst Guillemin]])&lt;ref&gt;Karl L. Wildes, Nilo A. Lindgren, ''A century of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, 1882-1982'', p157, MIT Press 1985 {{ISBN|0-262-23119-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested that he provide a proof of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the realisability of multi-port impedances.  Cauer himself had found a necessary condition but had failed to prove it to be sufficient. The goal for researchers then was "to remove the restrictions implicit in the Foster-Cauer realisations and find conditions on Z equivalent to realisability by a network composed of arbitrary interconnections of positive-valued R, C and L."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Perspectives in Mathematical System Theory, Control, and Signal Processing|last=Willems|first=Jan|last2=Hara|first2=Shinji|last3=Ohta|first3=Yoshito|last4=Fujioka|first4=Hisaya|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=9783540939177|location=Berlin|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a race to solve the problem and Brune won it.

Brune coined the term "[[positive-real]]" (PR) for that class of [[analytic function]]s that are realisable as an electrical network using passive components.&lt;ref&gt;Brune, 1931&lt;/ref&gt;  Brune also showed that if the case is limited to scalar PR functions then it is not necessary to allow ideal transformers (a limit to the usefulness of the theory) to be assured of a realisable network solution.  The eponymous "Brune cycle" continued fractions were invented by Brune to facilitate this proof.&lt;ref&gt;Cauer et al., pp&amp;nbsp;7&amp;ndash;8&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called Brune theorem is:&lt;blockquote&gt;a. The impedance ''Z''(''s'') of any electric network composed of passive components is positive real.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;b. If ''Z''(''s'') is positive real it is realisable by a network having as components passive (positive) ''R, C, L as well as ideal transformers T''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Brune is also responsible for the [[Brune test]] for determining the permissibility of interconnecting [[two-port network]]s. For his work, Brune is recognized as one of those who laid the foundation of network analysis by means of mathematics. For instance, American [[computer scientist]] [[Ernst Guillemin]] dedicated his book ''Synthesis of Passive Network'' to Brune, describing him with these words: "In my opinion the one primarily responsible for establishing a very broad and mathematically rigorous basis for realization theory generally was Otto Brune."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Fuzzification of Systems: The Genesis of Fuzzy Set Theory and its Initial Applications - Developments up to the 1970s|last=Seising|first=Rudolf|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=9783540717942|location=Berlin|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Brune was born in Kimberley, [[South Africa]] in 1901 and returned there in 1935.&lt;ref name=Seising&gt;Seising, p19&lt;/ref&gt;  He became Principal Research Officer at the National Research Laboratories, Pretoria.&lt;ref&gt;Wai-Kai Chen, ''Active Filters: Theory and Implementation'', p. 23, Wiley, 1986 {{ISBN|047182352X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''paracone''' is a 1960s [[atmospheric reentry]] or [[spaceflight|spaceflight mission]] [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Contingency aborts|abort]] concept using an inflatable [[ballute|ballistic]] cone.&lt;ref name=nasa1969&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yWUpAQAAIAAJ Analysis and design of space vehicle flight control systems, Volume 16: Abort], by A.L. Greensite, ''[[NASA]]'', 1969, accessed 2010-05-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.astronautix.com/p/paracone.html | title=Paracone concept | publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] | accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable feature of the paracone concept is that it facilitates an abort throughout the entire [[spaceflight|flight]] profile.&lt;ref name=nasa1969/&gt;&lt;!-- pp. 160 --&gt;

The '''phase-out of lightweight plastic bags in Australia''' is being pursued at local and state/territory level rather than nationally, with [[plastic bag]] bans implemented or pending in all [[states and territories of Australia|states and territories]] except [[New South Wales]]. Environmental groups have expressed their concern that [[Australia]] was lagging other countries in the [[phase-out of lightweight plastic bags]], including Botswana, Somalia and Tanzania.&lt;ref name="cormack"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cormack|first1=Lucy|title=Australia falling behind third world on global map of plastic bag bans|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/australia-falling-behind-third-world-on-global-map-of-plastic-bag-bans-20160407-go18ec.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 it was estimated that of the 5 billion plastic bags used annually by Australians, 150 million ended up as litter.&lt;ref name="cormack" /&gt;

In 2003 the [[Tasmania]]n town of [[Coles Bay, Tasmania|Coles Bay]] was the first location in Australia to ban plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2003-04-29-tasmania-carries-ecofight-bans-plastic-bags| title=Tasmania carries eco-fight, bans plastic bags| date=29 April 2003| publisher= Mail &amp; Guardian| accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in 2008 the then-Environment Minister [[Peter Garrett]] announced the [[Rudd Government (2007–10)|Rudd Government]]'s goal of a nationwide plastic bag ban by year's end, he later abandoned the initiative due to [[cost of living]] concerns and disagreement about the policy among state and territory governments.&lt;ref name="abc-2008-garrett"&gt;{{cite news|title=Garrett calls time on plastic bags|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-01-10/garrett-calls-time-on-plastic-bags/1008452|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=10 January 2008|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2008-end"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feneley|first1=Rick|title=Battle to bag the plastic goes on|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/battle-to-bag-the-plastic-goes-on-20081226-75l4.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to states and territories pursuing their own approaches.&lt;ref name="2010-tas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Darby|first1=Andrew|title=Ban on plastic bags spreads to Tasmania|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/ban-on-plastic-bags-spreads-to-tasmania-20101111-17pgm.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the "Zero Waste" program in South Australia led to the first statewide lightweight bag ban being introduced in October 2008. It is estimated that this move has saved 400 million bags annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerowaste.sa.gov.au/plastic|title=Plastic Bag Ban|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Zero Waste South Australia|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most recent jurisdiction to announce a ban on plastic bags is [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to commence on a date to be announced in early 2018.&lt;ref name="age-vic-ban" /&gt;

Since 2018, the country's two largest supermarket chains, [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] and [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]], voluntarily removed free lightweight plastic bags from their stores and began charging for reusable bags instead.&lt;ref name="coles-woolies"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slezak|first1=Michael|title=Woolworths and Coles to phase out single-use plastic bags|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/14/woolworths-to-phase-out-single-use-plastic-bags-over-12-months|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Guardian|date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reusable bags are sold at 15 cents in both chains.

==Background==
In [[Australia]], 6 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] HDPE bags were used in 2002.&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/waste/plastic-bags/index.html|title=Plastic bags|date=5 November 2009|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage reduced to 5.6 billion in 2004&lt;ref name="bag problems"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ecorecycle.sustainability.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/Plastic_Bag_Free_Challenge_-_Factsheet.pdf| title=Plastic Bag Fact Sheet | date=9 November 2005| publisher=Sustainability Victoria| accessdate=1 July 2012|format= pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.9 billion in 2007.&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU" /&gt; According to [[Keep Australia Beautiful]]'s 2015-16 National Litter Index, plastic bags made up 1% of the country's litter.&lt;ref name="thornton"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thornton |first1=Trevor |title=In banning plastic bags we need to make sure we're not creating new problems |url=https://theconversation.com/in-banning-plastic-bags-we-need-to-make-sure-were-not-creating-new-problems-81253 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Conversation |date=21 July 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="notreadysbs"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Christian |first1=Natasha |title=Why Australia may not be ready to ban plastic bags |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/why-australia-may-not-be-ready-to-ban-plastic-bags |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=SBS News |date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, ''[[The Project (Australian TV program)|The Project]]'' and [[Clean Up Australia]] launched a [[Change.org]] petition for the premiers of the three states without plastic bag bans - Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia - to "ban the bag".&lt;ref name="banthebag-news"&gt;{{cite news|title=Waleed Aly calls for nationwide ban|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/ban-the-bag-waleed-aly-calls-on-three-australian-premiers-to-ban-plastic-bags/news-story/7d8b5b5944bf7ec77fc6791380f15531|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=News.com.au|publisher=News Corp Australia|date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a segment on ''The Project'' about the petition, #BanTheBag became the top trending topic on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name="banthebag-news" /&gt; In February 2018, a motion was put in the Australian Federal Parliament calling for a nationwide ban of lightweight non-biodegradable plastic shopping bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/genpdf/chamber/hansardr/8f8fb221-5f56-4e53-b69a-e109f7156d20/0473/hansard_frag.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf|title=Plastic bag ban motion in Federal Parliament|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senate inquiries into recycling and marine plastic pollution also led to tripartisan recommendations by the Liberal, Labor and Greens parties to ban all single-use plastics in the country by 2023 and for all states and territories to ban plastic bags.&lt;ref name="zhou-senate"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zhou |first1=Naaman |title=All single-use plastics should be banned by 2023 Senate inquiry recommends |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/26/recycling-senate-inquiry-recommends-all-single-use-plastics-be-banned |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=26 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cormack-senate"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cormack |first1=Lucy |title=Plastic bag ban among recommendations by marine plastic senate inquiry |url=https://www.smh.com.au/environment/plastic-bag-ban-among-recommendations-by-marine-plastic-senate-inquiry-20160420-gob2lb.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=20 April 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Plastic Shopping Bags (Waste Avoidance) Bill'' passed the [[Parliament of South Australia]] on 13 November 2008, with a transitional period of 1 January to 4 May 2009.&lt;ref name="GLM-SA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Macfarlane|first1=Melanie|title=South Australia bans plastic shopping bags|url=http://www.greenlifestylemag.com.au/news/427/south-australia-bans-plastic-shopping-bags|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=G-Online|publisher=Green Lifestyle Magazine|date=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an official start date of 4 May 2009, South Australia was the first state or territory in Australia to ban plastic bags at the checkout, with retailers facing fines of up to $5,000 for distributing banned bags and retailer suppliers fined up to $20,000.&lt;ref name="sa20k"&gt;{{cite news|title=$20,000 for the wrong shopping bag|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/for-the-wrong-shopping-bag/news-story/1cc21937d58709af7c2870cdc4031c8d|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=News.Com.Au|agency=Australian Associated Press|date=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban does not extend to heavier plastic bags or fruit and vegetable bags.&lt;ref name="sa20k"/&gt;

The Northern Territory banned plastic bags with effect from 1 September 2011.&lt;ref name="nt-abc-today"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brennan|first1=Bridget|last2=Liston|first2=Gail|title=Plastic bag ban begins in Territory shops|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-01/20110901plastic-bag-ban-begins/2865780|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=1 September 2011|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodegradable and heavier bags remain legal.&lt;ref name="nt-abc-today" /&gt;

===Tasmania===
In 2003 [[Coles Bay, Tasmania|Coles Bay]] was the first Australian town to completely ban non-biodegradable plastic bags.&lt;ref name="cols-bay-push"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tas town pushes for nationwide bag ban|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/tas-town-pushes-for-nationwide-bag-ban/news-story/46b451f1ea13d036dea18e6dd8761ef4|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=News.Com.Au|date=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010 a Greens motion introduced to Tasmania's parliament to ban plastic bags received tripartisan support from Labor, the Liberals and the Greens.&lt;ref name="tas-tri"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tasmania to ban plastic shopping bags|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/tasmania-to-ban-plastic-shopping-bags/news-story/d6c62dbfa7302605efae0a3ae9dc906f|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=News.Com.Au|agency=AAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statewide ban began on 1 November 2013.&lt;ref name="mercury-1nov"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kempton|first1=Helen|title=Tasmania's shoppers adjust quickly to ban on plastic bags as new regulations kick in|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/tasmanias-shoppers-adjust-quickly-to-ban-on-plastic-bags-as-new-regulations-kick-in/news-story/329758beded5b88198e9f90e80c7fa1a|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Mercury|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 review found widespread support for the ban but a mixed environmental impact.&lt;ref name="jury-out"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paine|first1=Michelle|title=Jury still out on plastic bag success|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/jury-still-out-on-plastic-bag-ban-success/news-story/36fc7a481c1da865f55adf716740cdf4|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Mercury|date=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queensland===
In November 2016 the Queensland Government announced it would ban plastic bags from 2018, after the Opposition promised that it would implement a ban if it won the next state election.&lt;ref name="abc-qld-to-ban"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiggins|first1=Nick|title=Queensland to ban single-use plastic bags from 2018|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-25/queensland-to-ban-single-use-plastic-bags-from-2018/8056084|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=25 November 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Queensland to ban plastic shopping bags from 2018|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/25/queensland-to-ban-plastic-shopping-bags-from-2018|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Guardian|agency=Australian Associated Press|date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementing legislation passed the Queensland Parliament on 6 September 2017, accompanied by a [[Container deposit legislation in Australia|container refund recycling scheme]].&lt;ref name="qld-official-bt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Branco|first1=Jorge|title=Queensland's plastic bag ban is official, along with recycling refund|url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/politics/queensland/the-qld-plastic-bag-ban-is-official-along-with-a-recycling-refund-20170906-p4yvqw.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=Brisbane Times|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both initiatives are due to take effect on 1 July 2018.&lt;ref name="qld-official-bt" /&gt;

===Western Australia===
Two attempts by the [[City of Fremantle]] in 2013 and 2015 to introduce a citywide plastic bag ban were blocked through disallowance motions moved in the [[Western Australian Legislative Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kagi|first1=Jacon|title=Fremantle plastic bag ban binned again in WA Parliament|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-14/fremantle-plastic-bag-bag-blocked-by-state-parliament-again/6852518|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=14 October 2015|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, the Western Australian Government announced it would commence a statewide plastic bag ban on 1 July 2018.&lt;ref name="abc-wa"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trigger|first1=Rebecca|title=How will WA's plastic bag ban work?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-12/plastic-bag-ban-announced-in-wa-but-how-will-it-work/8895770|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=12 September 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wa-toban"&gt;{{cite news|title=WA to ban plastic bags next year|url=https://thewest.com.au/news/environment/wa-to-ban-plastic-bags-next-year-ng-s-1772065|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The West Australian|date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
In mid-2017, Victoria's state government expressed its preference for a national ban, while confirming it would be open to a state-level ban in future.&lt;ref name="vic-fed-alone"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heffernan|first1=Madeleine|last2=Preiss|first2=Benjamin|title=Victoria open to 'going it alone' on plastic bag ban if national deal not reached|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victoria-open-to-going-it-alone-on-plastic-bag-ban-if-national-deal-not-reached-20170725-gxi9av.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, [[Daniel Andrews]] stated that Victoria would introduce a ban on plastic bags, with the start date to be announced in early 2018 after consultation with industry and the community.&lt;ref name="age-vic-ban"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preiss|first1=Benjamin|title=Lightweight plastic bags to be banned in Victoria|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/lightweight-plastic-bags-to-be-banned-in-victoria-20171017-gz2s4i.html|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=The Age|agency=Fairfax Media|date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conversation-vic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thornton|first1=Trevor|title=Victoria's plastic bag ban: a good start, but we can do more|url=http://theconversation.com/victorias-plastic-bag-ban-a-good-start-but-we-can-do-more-86149|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=The Conversation|date=25 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government subsequently announced the plastic bag ban would commence by late 2019.&lt;ref name="theage-vic2019date"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cunningham |first1=Melissa |last2=Preiss |first2=Benjamin |title=Victoria set to ban plastic bags by next year |url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/victoria-set-to-ban-plastic-bags-by-next-year-20180627-p4znxv.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Age |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=27 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New South Wales===
The New South Wales Government currently has no plans to introduce a ban. In 2017 Premier [[Gladys Berejiklian]] stated that no regulation was needed because retailers responsible for 80% of plastic bags in the state (Coles, Woolworths and [[Harris Farm Markets|Harris Farm]]) would voluntarily stop providing free plastic bags themselves.&lt;ref name="nsw-not-needed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cormack|first1=Lucy|title=Plastic bag ban across NSW not needed if supermarkets act themselves: Premier|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/plastic-bag-ban-across-nsw-not-needed-if-supermarkets-act-themselves-premier-20170724-gxhfbx.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the country's largest supermarket chains, Woolworths and Coles, announced that they would stop providing free plastic bags to customers nationwide in 2018, and would sell thicker plastic bags for 15 cents each.&lt;ref name="ww-coles-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dulaney |first1=Michael |title=Woolworths and Coles to phase out plastic bags around the country |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-14/woolworths-to-phase-out-plastic-bags-around-the-country/8709336 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=14 July 2017 |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Withdrawing free bags is expected to save the retailers $170 million per year in reduced packaging costs while creating a revenue stream from selling thicker plastic bags.&lt;ref name="windfall" /&gt;

==Alternatives to plastic bags==
A side-effect of the plastic bag ban observed in South Australia was the increased use of [[bin bag|bin liners]], which have a greater environmental impact than plastic bags as they do not break down well in modern landfills.&lt;ref name="binliner2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chung|first1=Frank|title=Plastic bag ban: 'You don't actually need a plastic bin liner to put your rubbish out'|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/plastic-bag-ban-you-dont-actually-need-a-plastic-bin-liner-to-put-your-rubbish-out/news-story/629abba62ae7d5174208ca36d43615f2|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=News.com.au|agency=NewsCorp Australia|date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentally-friendly alternatives suggested instead of bin liners include [[composting]] food scraps and using free [[community newspaper]]s as liners instead.&lt;ref name="binliner2017" /&gt;

A 2007 report into shopping bag alternatives&lt;ref name=2007report&gt;{{cite report | last= Dili | first= Rae | date = 18 April 2007 | title = Comparison of existing life cycle analysis of shopping bag alternatives: Final Report | url = http://www.zerowaste.sa.gov.au/upload/resources/publications/plastic-bag-phase-out/LCA_shopping_bags_full_report%5B2%5D_2.pdf | publisher = Sustainability Victoria | format = PDF | access-date = 23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that paper bags were less environmentally friendly than plastic bags due to a higher [[carbon footprint]].&lt;ref name="wired-adler"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adler|first1=Ben|title=Banning Plastic Bags Is Great for the World, Right? Not So Fast|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/06/banning-plastic-bags-great-world-right-not-fast/|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=WIRED|date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, cotton bags were unsuitable due to the pesticides used and high volume of water needed to create them.&lt;ref name="wired-adler" /&gt; The "greenest" option was using recycled plastic bags.&lt;ref name="wired-adler" /&gt;

Concern has been expressed about potential unintended adverse health outcomes associated with the plastic bag ban rollout due to the lack of care by consumers in maintaining alternative shopping bags in a clean and healthy condition.  Overseas experiences in locations such as [[San Francisco]], where increased illness and even deaths were reported in the aftermath of similar bans to those in Australian states, suggest that this is a real concern.&lt;ref name="health-outcomes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Study links plastic bag ban with increase in food-related deaths|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/study-links-plastic-bag-ban-with-increase-in-foodrelated-deaths-20130208-2e2zf.html|accessdate=7 March 2018|work=Canberra Times|date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Positive-real functions''', often abbreviated to '''PR function''', are a kind of mathematical function that first arose in [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|electrical network analysis]]. They are [[Complex analysis#Complex functions|complex functions]], ''Z''(''s''), of a complex variable, ''s''.  A [[rational function]] is defined to have the PR property if it has a positive real part and is analytic in the right halfplane of the complex plane and takes on real values on the real axis.

In symbols the definition is,

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; \Re[Z(s)]&gt;0 \quad\text{if}\quad \Re(s) &gt; 0 \\
&amp; \Im[Z(s)]=0 \quad\text{if}\quad \Im(s)=0
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

In electrical network analysis, ''Z''(''s'') represents an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] expression and ''s'' is the [[complex frequency]] variable, often expressed as its real and imaginary parts;

:&lt;math&gt;s=\sigma+i\omega \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which terms the PR condition can be stated;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; \Re[Z(s)]&gt;0 \quad\text{if}\quad \sigma &gt; 0 \\
&amp; \Im[Z(s)]=0 \quad\text{if}\quad \omega=0
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The importance to network analysis of the PR condition lies in the realisability condition. ''Z''(''s'') is realisable as a [[one-port]] rational impedance if and only if it meets the PR condition.  Realisable in this sense means that the impedance can be constructed from a finite (hence rational) number of discrete ideal [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] linear elements ([[resistor]]s, [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s in electrical terminology).&lt;ref name=CauerMathisPauli&gt;E. Cauer, W. Mathis, and R. Pauli, "Life and Work of Wilhelm Cauer (1900 – 1945)", ''Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Symposium of Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS2000)'', Perpignan, June, 2000. [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall03/cs323/links/cauer.pdf Retrieved online] 19 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term ''positive-real function'' was originally defined by&lt;ref name=CauerMathisPauli /&gt; [[Otto Brune]] to describe any function ''Z''(''s'') which&lt;ref name=Brune1931a&gt;Brune, O, "Synthesis of a finite two-terminal network whose driving-point impedance is a prescribed function of frequency", Doctoral thesis, MIT, 1931. [http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/10661/36311006.pdf?sequence=1 Retrieved online] 3 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*is [[rational function|rational]] (the quotient of two [[polynomials]]),
*is real when ''s'' is real
*has positive real part when ''s'' has a positive real part
Many authors strictly adhere to this definition by explicitly requiring rationality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Network Theory |last=Bakshi |first=Uday |last2=Bakshi |first2=Ajay |year=2008 |publisher=Technical Publications |location=Pune |isbn=978-81-8431-402-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--U.A.Bakshi, J.S.Chitode --&gt; or by restricting attention to rational functions, at least in the first instance&lt;!-- Kendall Ling-chiao Su + --&gt;.&lt;ref name=Wing&gt;{{cite book |title=Classical Circuit Theory |last=Wing |first=Omar |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-09739-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a similar more general condition, not restricted to rational functions had earlier been considered by Cauer,&lt;ref name=CauerMathisPauli /&gt; and some authors ascribe the term ''positive-real'' to this type of condition&lt;!-- Wai-Kai Chen --&gt;, while other consider it to be a generalization of the basic definition.&lt;ref name=Wing /&gt;

==History==
The condition was first proposed by [[Wilhelm Cauer]] (1926)&lt;ref&gt;Cauer, W, "Die Verwirklichung der Wechselstromwiderst ände vorgeschriebener Frequenzabh ängigkeit", ''Archiv für Elektrotechnik'', '''vol 17''', pp355–388, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; who determined that it was a necessary condition.  [[Otto Brune]] (1931)&lt;ref name=Brune1931a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brune1931b&gt;Brune, O, "Synthesis of a finite two-terminal network whose driving-point impedance is a prescribed function of frequency", ''J. Math. and Phys.'', '''vol 10''', pp191–236, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; coined the term positive-real for the condition and proved that it was both necessary and sufficient for realisability.

==Properties==
*The sum of two PR functions is PR.&lt;!-- too obvious to mention? --&gt;
*The [[function composition|composition]] of two PR functions is PR. In particular, if ''Z''(''s'') is PR, then so are 1/''Z''(''s'') and ''Z''(1/''s'').
*All the [[zeros and poles]] of a PR function are in the left half plane or on its boundary the imaginary axis.
*Any poles and zeroes on the imaginary axis are [[zero (complex analysis)#Multiplicity_of_a_zero|simple]] (have a [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] of one).
*Any poles on the imaginary axis have real strictly positive [[residue (complex analysis)|residues]], and similarly at any zeroes on the imaginary axis, the function has a real strictly positive derivative.
*Over the right half plane, the minimum value of the real part of a PR function occurs on the imaginary axis (because the real part of an analytic function constitutes a [[harmonic function]] over the plane, and therefore satisfies the [[maximum principle]]).
*For a [[rational function|rational]] PR function, the number of poles and number of zeroes differ by at most one.

==Generalizations==
A couple of generalizations are sometimes made, with intention of characterizing the [[immittance]] functions of a wider class of passive linear electrical networks.

===Irrational functions===
The impedance ''Z''(''s'') of a network consisting of an infinite number of components (such as a semi-infinite [[Ladder_network#Ladder_topologies|ladder]]), need not be a rational function of ''s'', and in particular may have [[branch points]] on the negative real ''s''-axis. To accommodate such functions in the definition of PR, it is therefore necessary to relax the condition that the function be real for all real ''s'', and only require this when ''s'' is positive. Thus, a possibly irrational function ''Z''(''s'') is PR if and only if
*''Z''(''s'') is analytic in the open right half ''s''-plane (Re[''s''] &gt; 0)
*''Z''(''s'') is real when ''s'' is positive and real
*Re[''Z''(''s'')] ≥ 0 when Re[''s''] ≥ 0
Some authors start from this more general definition, and then particularize it to the rational case.

===Matrix-valued functions===
Linear electrical networks with more than one [[Port (circuit theory)|port]] may be described by [[impedance parameters|impedance or]] [[admittance parameters|admittance matrices]]. So by extending the definition of PR to matrix-valued functions, linear multi-port networks which are passive may be distinguished from those that are not. A possibly irrational matrix-valued function ''Z''(''s'') is PR if and only if
*Each element of ''Z''(''s'') is analytic in the open right half ''s''-plane (Re[''s''] &gt; 0)
*Each element of ''Z''(''s'') is real when ''s'' is positive and real
*The [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] part (''Z''(''s'') + ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;(''s''))/2 of ''Z''(''s'') is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive semi-definite]] when Re[''s''] ≥ 0

[[File:Arcade video game buttons.jpg|thumb|Generic [[arcade game]] buttons.]]

A '''push-button''' (also spelled '''pushbutton''') or simply '''button''' is a simple [[electrical switch|switch]] mechanism for controlling some aspect of a [[machine]] or a [[Process (engineering)|process]]. Buttons are typically made out of hard material, usually [[plastic]] or [[metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Push buttons and much more|url=http://www.thebuilderssupply.com/Push-buttons-and-much-more_b_14.html|publisher=thebuilderssupply.com|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface is usually flat or shaped to accommodate the human finger or hand, so as to be easily depressed or pushed. Buttons are most often [[Switch#Biased switches|biased switches]], although many un-biased buttons (due to their physical nature) still require a [[Spring (device)|spring]] to return to their un-pushed state.
Terms for the "pushing" of a button include '''pressing''', '''depressing''', '''mashing''', '''slapping''', '''hitting''', and '''punching'''.

== Uses ==
[[File:Calculator delete button.jpg|thumb|Buttons on a handheld [[calculator]].]]

The "push-button" has been utilized in [[calculators]], [[push-button telephone]]s, [[kitchen appliances]], and various other mechanical and electronic devices, home and commercial.

In industrial and commercial applications, push buttons can be connected together by a mechanical linkage so that the act of pushing one button causes the other button to be released. In this way, a stop button can "force" a start button to be released. This method of linkage is used in simple manual operations in which the machine or process has no [[electrical circuit]]s for control.

Red pushbuttons can also have large heads (called mushroom heads) for easy operation and to facilitate the stopping of a machine. These pushbuttons are called [[emergency stop]] buttons and for increased safety are mandated by the electrical code in many jurisdictions. This large mushroom shape can also be found in buttons for use with operators who need to wear [[glove]]s for their work and could not actuate a regular [[flush-mount]]ed push button.

[[File:Knopka 8 ugolnik.jpg|thumb|Button shaped as an octagon.]]

As an aid for operators and [[End-user|user]]s in industrial or commercial applications, a [[pilot light]] is commonly added to draw the attention of the user and to provide [[feedback]] if the button is pushed. Typically this light is included into the center of the pushbutton and a [[lens (optics)|lens]] replaces the pushbutton hard center disk. The source of the energy to illuminate the light is not directly tied to the contacts on the back of the pushbutton but to the action the pushbutton controls. In this way a start button when pushed will cause the process or machine operation to be started and a secondary contact designed into the operation or process will close to turn on the pilot light and signify the action of pushing the button caused the resultant process or action to start.

To avoid an operator from pushing the wrong button in [[error]], pushbuttons are often [[color-coded]] to associate them with their function. Commonly used colors are red for stopping the machine or process and green for starting the machine or process.

In [[popular culture]], the phrase "the button" (sometimes capitalized) refers to a (usually fictional) button that a military or government leader could press to launch [[nuclear weapon]]s.

=== Scram and scramble switches ===
Akin to [[fire alarm]] switches, some big red buttons, when deployed with suitable visual and audible warnings such as flashing lights and sirens for extreme exigent emergencies, are known as "scram switches" (from the slang term  [[wikt:scram|scram]], "get out of here"). Generally, such buttons are connected to large scale functions, beyond a regular fire alarm, such as automated shutdown procedures, complete facility power cut, fire suppression like halogen release, etc.

A variant of this is the scramble switch which triggers an alarm to activate emergent personnel to proactively attend to and go to such disasters. An air raid siren at an air base initiates such action, where the fighter pilots are alerted and "[[Scrambling (military)|scrambled]]" to their planes to defend the base.

'''Qi hardware''' is a project which produces copyleft hardware, in an attempt to apply the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s GNU GPL concept of [[copyleft]]ing software to the hardware layer. The project is both a community of popular [[open hardware]] websites and a company, co-founded by Wolfgang Spraul and Yi Zhang, that makes hardware products.

Copyleft hardware is essentially requiring that all plans for hardware design (i.e. [[circuit diagram|schematics]], [[bill of materials]] and [[printed circuit board|PCB]] layout data) are released under the [[Creative Commons license]] Attribution-ShareAlike ([[CC BY-SA]]) and that the software needed to both manufacture the device and at least some software, including [[device driver]]s, necessary to use the hardware is released under the GNU General Public License. Technology for copyleft hardware are to be [[software patent|patent-free]], and hence, all hardware which is Qi hardware is to be released early, often and publicly on the Internet.

The primary examples of Qi hardware projects are the [[Ben Nanonote|Ben NanoNote]] pocket computer, [[Elphel]] 353 video camera and [[Milkymist|Milkymist One video synthesizer]].

The '''Renewable Fuels Regulators Club''' (or '''REFUREC''') is a network of governmental institutions that offers a pan-European platform for discussion, information exchange and tackling cross-border issues relating to the [[biofuels]] market in the [[European Union]] and beyond.&lt;ref name="About the Renewable Fuels Regulators Club"&gt;[http://www.refurec.org/about About REFUREC] About section of the REFUREC website&lt;/ref&gt;

REFUREC was initiated in 2009 by the [[Renewable Fuels Agency]], a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Government]] [[non-departmental public body]], created by the [[Department for Transport]] to implement the [[Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation]] or RTFO.&lt;ref name="Year Two of the RTFO"&gt;[http://www.renewablefuelsagency.gov.uk/sites/rfa/files/Year_Two_RTFO_v2.pdf Year Two of the RTFO] RFA's Annual Report on the wider impacts of the RTFO with background information on the establishment of REFUREC, pdf p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The Renewable Fuels Regulators Club was established to help address consistent implementation and regulation of the biofuels market. By facilitating and fostering stronger working relations between counterparts working in the field throughout Europe, REFUREC aims to minimise the regulatory burden of the new rules, and to maximise the overall effectiveness of the [[Renewables Directive]].&lt;ref name="EC Transparency Platform"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/energy/renewables/transparency_platform/transparency_platform_en.htm EC Transparency Platform] Transparency Platform of the European Commission (according to article 24 of [[Directive 2009/28/EC]])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
REFUREC meets on a quarterly basis to share knowledge, ideas and strategies on how best to implement workable interpretations of the Renewables Directive across respective borders. The member states of the EU and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) have evolved different methods of regulating biofuel consumption. The different starting points, combined with the intrinsic subtleties and complexities of the legislation are what lead REFUREC to believe that this kind of close co-operation is key to successful implementation of the Renewables Directive.

The administrative part is provided by an informal, rotating secretariat. April 2011 - June 2012, the Spanish [[Comisión Nacional de Energía]] (CNE) led on the secretariat work&lt;ref name="CNE secretaría de REFUREC"&gt;[http://www.europapress.es/economia/energia-00341/noticia-economia-energia-cne-asume-secretaria-club-europeo-reguladores-biocarburantes-20110407121951.html CNE asume la secretaría de REFUREC] Europapress news item on the REFUREC secretariat function of the Spanish CNE&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully handed over in July 2012 to the Dutch Emissions Authority (Nederlandse Emissieautoriteit, Netherlands). October 2013 - September 2015, the Swedish Energy Agency coordinated the secretariat work. In October 2015, the Finnish Energy Authority took the lead and provided secretariat support for two years. Since September 2017, REFUREC is maintained by Orkustofnun, Iceland’s National Energy Authority.

==Meetings==
The inaugural meeting was held on 4 February 2010 in London, and was attended by representatives from the [[UK]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Slovak Republic]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], and the [[European Commission]]. To date, further workshops have been held in Brussels, Bonn, Madrid, The Hague, Copenhagen, Lisbon, Stockholm, Valletta, Dublin, Oslo, Luxembourg, Paris, Bratislava, Helsinki, Vienna, Tallinn and Reykjavik.

==Member organisations==
Since its kick-off meeting in 2009, membership has grown rapidly and currently organisations from 31 countries are participating.

[[File:Decameron 1432-cooking on spit.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Fowl roasting on a spit. Smoke from the fire rises to the smoke canopy, and is vented through the wall or ceiling; ''[[Decameron|The Decameron]]'', [[Flanders]], 1432.]]

A '''smoke canopy''' is a device hung over a fire to gather the smoke&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/forb/geutri/all.html&lt;/ref&gt; and vent it through a wall or roof. 

[[Fireplace]]s were not used during much of the Middle Ages, because there were no [[chimney]]s, which were not invented and popularized until the 12th century. Most fires for heating were placed on hearths in the middles of rooms, and the smoke was allowed to rise to vents in the roof or high in walls. Smoke canopies provided an alternative, gathering the smoke above a fire and venting, usually through a wall clearing the living area from harmful chemicals.

Most of the pictures we have of medieval smoke canopies show them being used in kitchens. They usually appeared over hearths that were placed against stone walls. Some were over free standing hearths, but this required special venting of the smoke.

Fire canopies are used to this day, especially in summer houses and mountain lodges as an alternative to expensive fireplace.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.es/books?id=HjDPRIC6QhwC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22smoke+canopy%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e_WMXSfJdv&amp;sig=wiUmXukOPoJZLGEVjIGaOFzL9A4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22smoke%20canopy%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Industrial Archeology (SIA)''' is a [[North America]]n [[nonprofit organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nonprofit Report for Society for Industrial Archeology | publisher = GuideStar | url = http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/23-7166954/society-industrial-archeology.aspx | accessdate = 2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to studying and preserving historic industrial sites, structures and equipment. It was founded in 1971 in [[Washington, D.C.]], and its members are primarily from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], although there is some crossover with similar [[industrial archaeology]] organizations in the [[United Kingdom]]. SIA's headquarters is currently located in the Department of Social Sciences at [[Michigan Technological University]] in [[Houghton, Michigan]]. In addition to the national organization, there are thirteen regional chapters throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the Society for Industrial Archeology (SIA) | publisher = Society for Industrial Archeology | url = http://www.sia-web.org/about/ | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Since its founding in October 1971, SIA members have gathered at an annual conference, which also serves as the annual business meeting required by its bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hyde | first = Charles K. | title = The Birth of the SIA and Reminiscences by Some of its Founders | journal = [[IA, The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology]] | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–16 | year = 1991 | jstor = 40968216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual conference is typically held each spring. The Fall Tour, a second annual gathering usually held in September or October, began in 1972. Both annual events feature visits to local industrial sites, both active and historical.  The conference additionally includes a day of paper sessions.  Industrial heritage study tours to other countries began in 1990 and occur on an irregular schedule.

SIA produces two official publications, the formal, [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] ''[[IA, The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology]]'' twice a year and the less formal quarterly ''Society for Industrial Archeology Newsletter (SIAN).''  The annual conference is typically accompanied by a custom guidebook profiling local industrial and cultural sites.  In addition, SIA produces occasional publications on special topics.

==Newsletter==
The ''Society for Industrial Archeology Newsletter (SIAN)'' ([[ISSN]] {{ISSN search link|0160-1067}}) is the Society's official [[newsletter]], published quarterly. ''SIAN'' publishes articles about recent events, summaries of the Society's annual conferences and fall tours, news about local chapters, brief abstracts of articles on industrial archeology-related subjects, and other notes and queries.

The first issue of ''SIAN'' was published in January 1972 and reported on the Society's founding. Volumes 1 through 9 consisted of six issues per calendar year, not including two special supplemental issues published in 1972. The current quarterly publication schedule with Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall issues began with Volume 10 in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SIA Newsletter |publisher=Society for Industrial Archeology |url=http://www.sia-web.org/publications/sia-newsletter/ |accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[AIAA]] Space Logistics Technical Committee, '''space logistics''' is

:... the theory and practice of driving space system design for operability, and of managing the flow of material, services, and information needed throughout a space system lifecycle.&lt;ref name=aiaa_sltc_def&gt;{{Cite web
  | author = AIAA STLC
  | title = Definition of Space Logistics
  | work = [https://info.aiaa.org/tac/SMG/SLTC/Web%20Pages/Definitions.aspx Space Logistics Definitions]
  | publisher = [[AIAA]] 
  | url = https://info.aiaa.org/tac/SMG/SLTC/Web%20Pages/Definitions.aspx
  | accessdate = 2011-09-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this definition in its larger sense includes terrestrial logistics in support of space travel, including any additional "design and development, acquisition, storage, movement, distribution, maintenance, evacuation, and disposition of space materiel", movement of people in space (both routine and for medical and other emergencies), and contracting and supplying any required support services for maintaining space travel.&lt;ref name=aiaa_sltc_def/&gt;

== History ==

[[Wernher von Braun]] spoke of the necessity (and the underdevelopment) of space logistics as early as 1960:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

&lt;/ref&gt;
:"We have a logistics problem coming up in space ... that will challenge the thinking of the most visionary logistics engineers. As you know, we are currently investigating three regions of space: near-Earth, the lunar region, and the planets. While it is safe to say that all of us have undoubtedly been aware of many or most of the logistics requirements and problems in the discussion, at least in a general way, I think it is also safe to state that many of us have not realized the enormous scope of the tasks performed in the logistics area. I hope the discussions bring about a better understanding of the fact that logistics support is a major portion of most large development projects. Logistics support, in fact, is a major cause of the success or failure of many undertakings."

==Background==
James D. Baker and Frank Eichstadt of [[SPACEHAB]] wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt&gt;{{cite journal
 | title = Commercial cargo transport service for ISS
 | journal = [[Acta Astronautica]]
 | date = May 2005
 | volume = 57
 | issue = 2
 | doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2005.04.001
|bibcode = 2005AcAau..57..257B }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
:The United States space exploration goals expressed in January 2004 call for the retirement of the [[Space Shuttle program]] following completion of [[International Space Station]] (ISS) construction. Since the Shuttle is instrumental in transporting large quantities of cargo to and from the ISS, this functional capability must be preserved to ensure ongoing station operations in a post-Shuttle era. Fulfilling ongoing cargo transport requirements to the ISS is a prime opportunity for NASA to reduce costs and preserve and repurpose the unique and limited Shuttle resource by acquiring cargo transportation services commercially. Further, implementing such a service prior to retirement of the Shuttle reduces risk to the vehicle and her crews by eliminating their use for routine cargo transport missions while accelerating the readiness for alternative ISS-support transportation.

:In January 2004, President Bush directed NASA to begin an initiative that focuses on exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond. This initiative calls for the completion of International Space Station (ISS) assembly by the end of the decade coincident with retirement of the Space Shuttle.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Bush, A Renewed Spirit of Discovery: The Presidents Vision for U.S. Space Exploration, January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Retirement of the Shuttle while ISS operations are still being conducted results in reduced capability to supply ISS logistics requirements. An examination of existing and planned logistics carriers shows that there are deficiencies in both capacity and capability to support ISS needs. [[SPACEHAB]]'s history of space station logistics delivery and existing ground infrastructure coupled with NASA's mandate and documented intent to acquire commercial space systems and services when possible has led SPACEHAB to develop a versatile and affordable cargo transport service for ISS .&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended, Public Law 85-568, 1984.
&lt;/ref&gt;

:Sustainable space exploration is impossible without appropriate supply chain management and unlike Apollo, future exploration will have to rely on a complex supply network on the ground and in space. The primary goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive supply chain management framework and planning tool for space logistics. The eventual integrated space logistics framework will encompass terrestrial movement of material and information, transfer to [[launch site]]s, integration of payload onto launch vehicles and launch to [[Low Earth Orbit]], in-space and planetary transfer, and planetary surface logistics. The MIT-led interplanetary supply chain management model will take a four-phase development approach:
:1. Review of supply chain management lessons learned from Earth-based commercial and military projects, including naval submarine and arctic logistics
:2. Space logistics network analyses based on modeling Earth-Moon-Mars orbits and expected landing-exploration sites
:3. Demand/supply modeling that embraces uncertainty in demand, cargo mix, costs, and supply chain disruptions
:4. Development of an interplanetary supply chain architecture.

==State of the ISS logistics capability in 2005==
A snapshot of the logistics of a single space facility, the International Space Station, was provided in 2005 via a comprehensive study done by James Baker and Frank Eichstadt.&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;  This article section makes extensive reference to that study.

===ISS cargo requirements===
{{asof|2004}}, the [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] [[Space Shuttle]], the [[Russia]]n [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]], and to a very limited extent, the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] vehicles were the only [[space transport]] systems capable of transporting ISS cargo.&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;

However, in 2004, it was already anticipated that the European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] (ATV) and Japanese [[H-II Transfer Vehicle|H-IIA Transfer Vehicle]] (HTV) would be introduced into service before the end of [[Assembly of the International Space Station|ISS Assembly]]. As of 2004, the US Shuttle transported the majority of the pressurized and unpressurized cargo and provides virtually all of the recoverable [[downmass|down mass]] capability (the capability of non-destructive reentry of cargo).&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;{{update after|2012|12|27}}

===Cargo vehicle capabilities===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:An understanding of the future ISS cargo requirements is necessary to size a commercial cargo vehicle designed to replace the Shuttle's capabilities and capacities and augment currently planned alternative vehicles. Accurate estimates of ISS cargo transfer requirements are difficult to establish due to ongoing changes in logistics requirements, crew tending levels, vehicle availabilities, and the evolving role the ISS will play in NASA's space exploration and research goals.
:An increased unpressurized cargo delivery requirement is shown during the years 2007–2010. This increased rate is a result of a current plan to preposition unpressurized spares on the ISS prior to Shuttle retirement. Provision of a commercial cargo carrier capable of transporting unpressurized spares to supplement the Shuttle eliminates the prepositioning requirement and aligns the estimated averages during 2007–2010 to approximately 24,000&amp;nbsp;kg for pressurized cargo and 6800&amp;nbsp;kg for unpressurized cargo. Considering the delivery capability of the remaining systems after the Shuttle is retired yields.
:Retirement of the Shuttle and reliance on the Progress, ATV, and HTV for ISS logistics will result in no significant recoverable down-mass capability. Further, no evidence suggests that any of these cargo transport systems can increase production and launch rates to cover the cargo delivery deficiency.

===Commercial opportunity===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:In addition to ISS support deficiencies, alternative opportunities for a commercial cargo transport system exist. The retirement of the Shuttle will also result in an inability to conduct Low Earth Orbit (LEO) research independent of the ISS. A commercial payload service could serve as a free-flying research platform to fulfill this need. As logistics support requirements for NASA's space exploration initiative emerge, existing commercial system can be employed.

:Finally, nascent interest in the development of non-government commercial space stations must take resupply issues into consideration. Such considerations will undoubtedly be subjected to a make/buy analysis. Existing systems which have amortized their development costs across multiple government and non-government programs should favor a “buy” decision by commercial space station operators. As these markets arise, commercial companies will be in a position to provide logistics services at a fraction of the cost of government-developed systems. The resulting economies of scale will benefit both markets. This conclusion was reached by a Price-Waterhouse study chartered by NASA in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Price Waterhouse, Analysis of NASA lease and purchase alternatives for the commercial Middeck augmentation module, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that the value of SPACEHAB's flight-asset-based commercial module service with an estimated net-present-value of $160 million would have cost the US government over $1 billion to develop and operate using standard cost plus contracting. SPACEHAB's commercial operations and developments (such as the Integrated Cargo Carrier) since 1991 represent further cost savings over government-owned and operated systems.

:Commercial companies are more likely to efficiently invest private capital in service enhancements, assured continued availability, and enhanced service capability. This tendency, commonplace in non-aerospace applications, has been demonstrated by SPACEHAB in the commercial space systems market via continued module enhancements and introduction of new logistics carriers.

:Shortfalls in ISS cargo transport capacity, emerging opportunities, and experience gained from SPACEHAB's existing ground and flight operations have encouraged development of Commercial Payload Service (CPS). As a commercially developed system, SPACEHAB recognizes that to optimize its capability and affordability requires that certain approaches in system development and operations be taken.

:The first approach levies moderate requirements on the system. Introducing fundamental capabilities on the front end and scarring for enhanced capabilities later reduces cost to launch and shortens development time.

:The second one is the utilization of existing technology and capabilities, where appropriate. A typical feature of NASA programs is the continual reach for newly developed technologies. While attractive from a technical advancement perspective, this quest is expensive and often fails to create operational capabilities. A commercially developed cargo module will maximize the use of existing technologies (off the shelf where possible) and seek technical advances only where system requirements or market conditions drive the need for such advances. Additionally, costs associated with the development of spacecraft are not limited to those associated with the vehicle systems. Significant costs associated with the infrastructure must also be considered. SPACEHAB's existing logistics and vehicle processing facilities co-located with the Eastern launch range and at the Sea Launch facilities enable avoidance of significant system development costs.

:Finally, SPACEHAB has realized cost and schedule reductions by employing commercial processes instead of Government processes. As a result, SPACEHAB's mission integration template for a Shuttle-based carrier is 14 months, compared to 22 months for a similar Shuttle-based Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM).&lt;ref&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Station program implementation plan, vol. 6: Cargo Physical Integration, SSP 50200-06, December 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rack transfer capability===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:The ISS utilizes the [[International Standard Payload Rack]] (ISPR) as the primary payload and experiment accommodations structure in all US operated modules. Transferring ISPRs onto and off the ISS requires passage through the hatch only found at the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) berthing locations. The diameter of the CBM combined with ISPR proportions typically drives cargo vehicle diameters to sizes only accommodated by 5 m payload fairings launched on Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELV).

===Recoverable reentry–pressurized payloads===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:The Russian Progress vehicle has long served as a cargo vehicle which, upon departing a space station, destructively reenters the atmosphere destroying all “cargo” on board. This approach works very effectively for removing unwanted mass from a space station. However, NASA has indicated that the return of payloads from the ISS is highly desirable [5]. Therefore, a commercial system must examine the implications of including a pressurized payload return capability either in the initial design or as an enhanced feature of the service to be introduced in the future. Providing such capability requires the incorporation of thermal protection subsystem, deorbit targeting subsystems, landing recovery subsystems, ground recovery infrastructure, and FAA licensure. The recovery of unpressurized payloads presents unique challenges associated with the exposed nature of unpressurized carriers. To implement a recoverable reentry system for unpressurized payloads requires the development of an encapsulation system. Encapsulation activities must either occur autonomously prior to reentry or as a part of the operations associated with loading the unpressurized cargo carrier with return cargo. In either case, additional cost associated with spacecraft systems or increased operational requirements will be higher than simply loading and departing a pressurized carrier for a destructive reentry.

===Mixed manifest capability===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:Typically, the avoidance of point solutions provides flexibility for a given system to provide variable capabilities. Designing a cargo carrier that mixes pressurized and unpressurized systems can lead to increased cost if all associated cargo accommodations must be flown on every flight. To avoid unnecessary costs associated with designing and flying structure that accommodates fixed relative capacities of all types of payloads, a modular approach is taken for CPS. Anticipated cargo transport requirements for ISS after the Shuttle is retired indicate that dedicated pressurized and unpressurized missions can support the ISS up-mass requirements. Utilizing common base features (i.e. service module, docking system, etc.) and modularizing the pressurized and unpressurized carrier elements of the spacecraft assures flexibility while avoiding point solutions.

===Propellant transfer===
Baker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:&lt;ref name=baker_eichstadt/&gt;
:The Russian Segment of the ISS (RSOS) has the capability via the probe and cone docking mechanisms to support propellant transfer. Incorporation of propellant transfer capability introduces international issues requiring the coordination of multiple corporate and governmental organizations. Since ISS propellant requirements are adequately provided for by the Russian Progress and ESA ATV, costs associated with incorporating these features can be avoided. However, the CPS’ modular nature coupled with the inherent capability of selected subsystems enables economical alternatives to propellant transfer should ISS needs require.

:Indirect costs considered in developing the CPS architecture include licensing requirements associated with [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] (ITAR) and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) commercial launch and entry licensing requirements. ITAR licensing drives careful selection of the vehicle subsystem suppliers. Any utilization or manufacturing of spacecraft subsystems by non-US entities can only be implemented once the appropriate Department of State and/or Commerce approvals are in place. FAA licensing requirements necessitate careful selection of the launch and landing sites. Vehicles developed by a US organized corporation, even if launched in another country, require review of the vehicle system, operations, and safety program by the FAA to ensure that risks to people and property are within acceptable limits &lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Administration-Office of Commercial Space Transportation, 14 CFR, November 2000 (Chapter III).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downmass==
While significant focus of space logistics is on ''upmass'', or payload mass carried up to orbit from Earth, space station operations also have significant downmass requirements. 
Returning cargo from [[low-Earth orbit]] to Earth is known as transporting ''downmass'', the total logistics payload mass that is returned from space to the surface of the Earth for subsequent use or analysis.&lt;ref name=nsfdc20120420/&gt;
Downmass logistics are important aspects of [[Research and development|research]] and [[manufacturing]] work that occurs in orbital space facilities.

For the [[International Space Station]], there have been periods of time when downmass capability was severely restricted.  For example, for approximately ten months from the time of the retirement of the Space Shuttle following the [[STS-135]] mission in July 2011—and the resultant loss of the Space Shuttle's ability to return payload mass—an increasing concern became returning downmass cargo from [[low-Earth orbit]] to Earth for subsequent use or analysis.&lt;ref name=nsfdc20120420&gt;
{{cite news |last=Bergin|first=Chris |title=Cargo up and down: Dragon to demonstrate the importance of downmass |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/04/cargo-up-down-spacexs-dragon-demonstrate-importance-downmass/ |accessdate=2012-04-23 |newspaper=NASA Spaceflight |date=2012-04-20 |quote=''"Cargo runs in general are vital to the Station, however, not least since the end of the massive capability enjoyed by the ISS via the Space Shuttle fleet. With the orbiters now retired, an array of resupply vehicles are aiming to take up the slack, ranging from the ongoing Russian Progress vehicles, to Europe’s ATV, Japan’s HTV and – to a very small extent – the Russian Soyuz vehicles.  However, it was the additional capability of the Shuttle’s downmass role with the ISS that was often understated during the final years of their flights to the Station, something the Russian, European and Japanese resupply vehicles could not mitigate once the fleet was retired, bar the very small downmass allowed by the Soyuz."''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During this period of time, of the four space vehicles capable of reaching and delivering cargo to the International Space Station, only the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] vehicle could return even a very small cargo payload to Earth. The Soyuz cargo downmass capability was limited as the entire [[space capsule]] was filled to capacity with the three ISS crew members who return on each Soyuz return.  None of the remaining [[Comparison of space station cargo vehicles|cargo resupply vehicles]] — the [[Russian Space Agency]] [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]], the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]], the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) [[H-II Transfer Vehicle|HTV]] — can return any downmass cargo for terrestrial use or examination.&lt;ref name=nsfdc20120420/&gt;

After 2012, with the successful berthing of the [[private spaceflight|commercially contracted]] [[SpaceX]] [[Dragon spacecraft|Dragon]] during the [[COTS Demo Flight 2|Dragon C2+]] mission in May 2012, and the [[SpaceX CRS-1|initiation of operational cargo flights]] in October 2012,&lt;ref name=bbc20121028&gt;

A '''strand jack''' (also known as '''strandjack''') is a [[jack (device)|jack]] used to lift very heavy (e.g. thousands tons or more with multiple jacks) loads for construction and engineering purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brighthubengineering.com/machine-design/19760-strand-jacks-what-are-they Strand Jacks – What are they?]&lt;/ref&gt;  Strandjacking was invented by [[Vorspann System Losinger|VSL]] Australia's Patrick Kilkeary &amp; Bruce Ramsay in 1969 for [[Prestressed concrete#Post-tensioned concrete|concrete post tensioning]] systems, and are now used all over the world for heavy lifting, to erect bridges, offshore structures, refineries, power stations, major buildings and other structures where the use of conventional cranes is either impractical or too expensive.

== Use ==
[[File:Litzenheber.gif|thumb|upright|Animation of a Strand jack]]
Strand jacks can be used horizontally for pulling objects and structures, and are widely used in the oil and gas industry for skidded loadouts. Oil rigs of 38,000 [[Tonne|t]] have been moved in this way from the place of construction on to a [[barge]].
Since multiple jacks can be operated simultaneously by hydraulic controllers, they can be used in tandem to lift very large loads of thousands of tons. Even the tandem use of two cranes is very difficult operation. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bygging-uddemann.se/supply/heavy-lifting-systems/strand-jacks.html Strand Jack Lifting]&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
A strand jack is a hollow [[hydraulic]] cylinder with a set of steel cables (the "strands") passing through the open centre, each one passing through two clamps - one mounted to either end of the cylinder.

The jack operates in the manner of a [[caterpillar]]'s walk: climbing (or descending) along the strands by releasing the clamp at one end, expanding the cylinder, clamping there, releasing the trailing end, contracting, and clamping the trailing end before starting over again. The real significance of this device lies in the facility for precision control.

The expansion and contraction can be done at any speed, and paused at any location.  Although a jack may lift only 1700 tons or so, there exist [http://www.dormanlongtechnology.com/en/Products/heavy_lift_control_systems.htm computer control systems] that can operate 120 jacks simultaneously, offering [[fingertip feel]] movement control over extremely massive objects.

== In construction ==
'''Strand jacking''' is a construction process whereby large pre-fabricated building sections are carefully lifted and precisely placed.  The alternative would be to do all assembly ''in situ'', even if expensive, technically risky, or dangerous.

Strand jacks for heavy lifting and skidding operations are owned and operated by a large number of construction and heavy lifting companies around the world.  They are currently manufactured by a small number of companies based in Europe.

== Notable uses ==
*[[Kursk submarine disaster]]
Uses outside of construction 
* [[Costa Concordia disaster]], in the ship salvage phase.

The '''timeline of underwater diving technology''' is a chronological list of notable events in the history of underwater diving.

==Pre-industrial==

* Ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] era.: There have been many instances of men swimming or diving for combat, but they always had to hold their breath, and had no diving equipment, except sometimes a hollow plant stem used as a [[Snorkel (swimming)|snorkel]].&lt;ref name="mergulhadores" /&gt;
* About 500 BC: (Information originally from [[Herodotus]]): During a naval campaign the Greek [[Scyllis]] was taken aboard ship as prisoner by the Persian King [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes I]]. When Scyllis learned that Xerxes was to attack a Greek flotilla, he seized a knife and jumped overboard. The Persians could not find him in the water and presumed he had drowned. Scyllis made his way among all the ships in Xerxes's fleet, cutting each ship loose from its moorings; he used a hollow reed as snorkel to remain unobserved. Then he swam nine miles (15 kilometers) to rejoin the Greeks off [[Cape Artemisium]].&lt;ref name="Beloe 1791" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones 1929" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Paton 1917" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost 1968" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marx 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scyllis" /&gt;
* The use of [[diving bell]]s was recorded by the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] in the 4th century BC: "...they enable the divers to respire equally well by letting down a [[cauldron]], for this does not fill with water, but retains the air, for it is forced straight down into the water."&lt;ref name="Bachrach 1998" /&gt;
* 1300 or earlier: Persian divers were using diving [[goggles]] with windows made of the polished outer layer of [[tortoiseshell material|tortoiseshell]].&lt;ref name="Marx 1990" /&gt;
* 15th century: [[Konrad Kyeser]], illustrated his manual of military technology ''[[Bellifortis]]'' with a diving suit fitted with a hose to the surface. The drawing is also visible in [[Hans_Talhoffer#Works|Ms.Thott.290.2º]]{{clarify|reason= what is Ms.Thott.290.2º?|date=October 2017}} attributed to [[Hans Talhoffer]], which reproduces sections of ''Bellifortis''.{{cn|date=October 2017}} 
* 15th century: [[Leonardo da Vinci]] made the first known mention of air tanks in Italy: he wrote in his Atlantic Codex (Biblioteca Ambrosiana, [[Milan]]) that systems were used at that time to artificially breathe under water, but he did not explain them in detail. Some drawings, however, showed different kinds of snorkels and an air tank (to be carried on the breast) that presumably should have no external connections. Other drawings showed a complete immersion kit, with a plunger suit which included a sort of mask with a box for air. The project was so detailed that it included a [[urine]] collector.&lt;ref name="da Vinci" /&gt;
* 1535: [[Guglielmo de Lorena]] and Francesco de Marchi dived on a Roman vessel in Lake Nemi using a one-man [[diving bell]] invented by Guglielmo.&lt;ref name="Eliav 2015" /&gt;
* 1616: [[Franz Kessler]] built an improved diving bell.&lt;ref name="Acott 1999" /&gt;
* Around 1620: [[Cornelius Drebbel]] may have made a crude [[rebreather]]: see [[Rebreather#History of rebreathers]].&lt;ref name="Acott 1999" /&gt;
* 1650: [[Otto von Guericke]] built the first air pump.&lt;ref name="Acott 1999" /&gt;
* 1715: 
** the ''chevalier'' (sir) [[Pierre Rémy de Beauve]], a French aristocrat who served as ''[[Gardes de la Marine|garde de la marine]]'' in [[Brest, France|Brest]], built one of the oldest known [[Standard diving dress|diving dresses]]. De Beauve's dress was equipped with a metal helmet and two hoses, one of them [[surface-supplied diving|air-supplied from the surface]] by a [[bellows]] and the other one for evacuation of the exhaled air.&lt;ref name="Musee de Scaphandre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Musee de Scaphandre 2" /&gt;
** the Englishman [[John Lethbridge]], a wool merchant, invented a diving barrel and successfully salvaged valuables from wrecks.&lt;ref name="Acott 1999" /&gt;

==Industrial era==
===Start of modern diving===
* 1772: the first diving dress using a compressed-air reservoir was successfully designed and built in 1772 by ''Sieur'' (old French for "sir" or "Mister") [[Fréminet]], a Frenchman from [[Paris]]. Fréminet conceived an autonomous breathing machine equipped with a helmet, two hoses for inhalation and exhalation, a suite and a reservoir, dragged by and behind the diver,&lt;ref name="Musee de Scaphandre 3" /&gt; although Fréminet later put it on his back.&lt;ref name="Perrier 2008" /&gt; Fréminet called his invention ''machine hydrostatergatique'' and used it successfully for more than ten years in the harbours of [[Le Havre]] and [[Brest, France|Brest]], as stated in the explanatory text of a 1784 painting.&lt;ref name="Cousteau 1955" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guienne" /&gt;
* 1774: [[John Day (carpenter)|John Day]] became the first person known to have died in an underwater accident while testing a "diving chamber" in [[Plymouth Sound]].&lt;ref name="Tall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecott" /&gt;
* 1776: [[David Bushnell]] invented the [[American Turtle|''Turtle'']], first submarine to attack another ship. It was used in the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Griswold 1820" /&gt;
* 1797: [[Karl Heinrich Klingert]] designed a full diving dress in 1797. This design consisted of a large metal helmet and similarly large metal belt connected by leather jacket and pants.&lt;ref name="Raanan 2010" /&gt;
* 1798: in June F. W. Joachim, employed by Klingert, successfully completed the first practical tests of Klingert's armor.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1800: [[:de:Peter Kreeft (Kapitän)|Captain Peter Kreeft]] of Germany dived several times with his helmet diving equipment to show it to king [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1800: [[Robert Fulton]] built a [[submarine]], the "[[Nautilus (1800)|Nautilus]]".&lt;ref name="Dickinson 1913" /&gt;
* 1837: Captain William H. Taylor demonstrated his "submarine dress" at the annual [[American Institute Fair]] at Niblo's Garden, New York City.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1839:

===Rebreathers===
{{main article|Rebreather#History}}
* 1808: on June 17, ''Sieur'' {{ill |Pierre-Marie Touboulic |fr}} from [[Brest, France|Brest]], a mechanic in [[Napoleon]]'s Imperial Navy, patented the oldest known [[oxygen rebreather]], but there is no evidence of any prototype having been manufactured. This early rebreather design worked with an oxygen reservoir, the oxygen being delivered progressively by the diver himself and circulating in a closed circuit through a [[Sponge (material)|sponge]] soaked in [[limewater]].&lt;ref name="plongeesout.com" /&gt; Touboulic called his invention ''Ichtioandre'' (Greek for 'fish-man').&lt;ref name="Ichtioandre drawing" /&gt;
* 1849: Pierre-Aimable de Saint Simon Sicard (a [[chemist]]) made the first practical oxygen rebreather. It was demonstrated in London in 1854.&lt;ref name="hds4537" /&gt;
*1853: Professor T. Schwann designed a rebreather in [[Belgium]]; he exhibited it in Paris in 1878.&lt;ref name="Bech" /&gt; It had a big backpack oxygen tank at pressure about 13 [[Bar (unit)|bar]], and two scrubbers containing [[sponge]]s soaked in [[caustic soda]].
* 1876: An English merchant seaman, [[Henry Fleuss]], developed the first workable self-contained diving rig that used compressed oxygen. This prototype of closed-circuit scuba used rope soaked in [[caustic potash]] to absorb carbon dioxide so the exhaled gas could be re-breathed.&lt;ref name="rebreather_hx" /&gt;

===Diving helmets improved and in common use===
* 1808: Brizé-Fradin designed a small bell-like helmet connected to a low-pressure backpack air container.&lt;ref name="hds4537" /&gt;
* 1820: Paul Lemaire d'Augerville (a [[Paris]]ian dentist) invented and made a diving apparatus with a copper backpack cylinder, and with a [[Rebreather#Counterlungs|counterlung]] to save air, and with an inflatable lifejacket connected. It was used down to 15 or 20 meters for up to an hour in salvage work. He started a successful salvage company.&lt;ref name="hds4537" /&gt;
* 1825: [[William H. James (inventor)|William H. James]] designed a self-contained diving suit that had compressed air in an iron container worn around the waist.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1827: Beaudouin in France developed a diving helmet fed from an air cylinder pressurized to 80 to 100 bar. The [[French Navy]] was interested, but nothing came of this.&lt;ref name="hds4537" /&gt;
* 1829: (1828?)
**[[Charles Anthony Deane]] and John Deane of [[Whitstable]] in [[Kent]] in England designed the first air-pumped [[diving helmet]] for use with a diving suit. It is said {{by whom|date=March 2017}}that the idea started from a crude emergency rig-up of a [[Firefighter|fireman]]'s water-pump (used as an air pump) and a knight-in-armour helmet used to try to rescue horses from a burning stable. Others say that it was based on earlier work in 1823 developing a "smoke helmet".&lt;ref name="Lonsdale 2012" /&gt; However the suit was not attached to the helmet, so a diver could not bend over or invert without risk of flooding the helmet and drowning. Nevertheless, the diving system is used in salvage work, including the successful removal of cannon from the British warship HMS Royal George in 1834-35. This 108-gun fighting ship sank in 65 feet of water at Spithead anchorage in 1783.&lt;ref name="Lonsdale 2012" /&gt;
** [[E.K.Gauzen]], a Russian naval [[technician]] of [[Kronshtadt]] [[naval base]] (a [[district]] of [[Saint Petersburg]]), offered a "diving [[machine]]". His invention was an air-pumped metallic [[helmet]] strapped to a [[leather]] suit (an overall). The bottom of the helmet was open. The helmet is strapped to the leather suit by metallic tape. Gauzen's diving suit and its further modifications were used by the Russian [[Navy]] until 1880. The modified [[diving suit]] of the Russian Navy, based on Gauzen's [[invention]], was known as "[[three-bolt equipment]]".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1837: Following up Leonardo's studies, and those of the astronomer [[Edmond Halley|Halley]], [[Augustus Siebe]] developed [[surface supplied diving]] apparatus which became known as [[standard diving dress]].&lt;ref name="spums_hx" /&gt; By attaching the Deane brothers helmet to a suit, Augustus Siebe developed the Siebe "Closed" Dress combination diving helmet and suit, considered the foundation of modern diving dress. This was a significant evolution from previous models of "open" dress that did not allow a diver to invert. (Siebe-Gorman went on to manufacture helmets continuously until 1975).&lt;ref name="Lonsdale 2012" /&gt;
* 1840: The Royal Navy uses Siebe closed dress for salvage and blasting work on the "Royal George", and subsequently the Royal Engineers standardise on this equipment.&lt;ref name="Lonsdale 2012" /&gt;
* 1843: The Royal Navy establishes the first diving school.&lt;ref name="Lonsdale 2012" /&gt;
* 1855: [[Joseph-Martin Cabirol]] patented a new model of standard diving dress, mainly issued from Siebe's designs. The suit was made out of rubberized canvas and the helmet, for the first time, includes a hand-controlled tap that the diver used to evacuate his exhaled air. The tap included on its turn a safety valve which prevented water from entering in the helmet. Until 1855 diving helmets were equipped with only three circular windows (for front, left and right sides). Cabirol's helmet introduced the later well known fourth window, situated in the upper front part of the helmet and allowing the diver to watch above him. Having been presented to the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|''Exposition Universelle'' in Paris]] Cabirol's diving dress won the silver medal. These original diving dress and helmet are now preserved at the ''[[Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers]]'' in Paris.&lt;ref name="Cabirol" /&gt;

===The first diving regulators===
[[File:Dykeri, fig 6, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|upright|Diving set by Rouquayrol and Denayrouze with barrel-shaped air tank on the diver's back, depicted here in its surface-supplied configuration.]]
* 1838: Dr. Manuel Théodore Guillaumet invented a twin-hose [[demand regulator]].  On June 19, 1838, in London, England, a Mr. William Edward Newton filed a patent (no. 7695:  "Diving apparatus") for a diaphragm-actuated, twin-hose demand valve for divers.&lt;ref name="Bevan 1990" /&gt; However, it is believed that Mr. Newton was merely filing a patent on behalf of Dr. Guillaumet. The illustration of the apparatus in Newton's patent application is identical to that in Guillaumet's patent application; furthermore, Mr. Newton was apparently an employee of the British Office for Patents, who applied for patents on behalf of foreign applicants.&lt;ref name="Guillaumet-Newton"/&gt; It is demonstrated in [[Surface supplied diving|surface-demand]] use. During the demonstration, use duration was limited to 30 minutes because the dive was in cold water without a diving suit.&lt;ref name="Mechanique appliquee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scaphandre autonome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Perrier 2008 p45"/&gt;
* 1860: in [[Espalion]] (France), mining engineer [[Benoît Rouquayrol]] designed a self-contained breathing set with a backpack cylindrical air tank that supplied air through the first demand [[diving regulator|regulator]] to be commercialized (as of 1865, see below). Rouquayrol calls his invention ''régulateur'' ('regulator'), having conceived it to help miners avoid drowning in flooded mines.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1864: [[Benoît Rouquayrol]] met navy officer [[Auguste Denayrouze]] for the first time, in Espalion, and on Denayrouze's initiative, they adapted Rouquayrol's invention to diving. After having adapted it, they called their recently patented device ''appareil plongeur Rouquayrol-Denayrouze'' ('Rouquayrol-Denayrouze diving apparatus'). The diver still walked on the seabed and did not swim. The air pressure tanks made with the technology of the time could only hold 30 atmospheres, allowing dives of only 30 minutes at no more than ten metres deep;&lt;ref name="Musee du Scaphandre 5" /&gt; during surface-supplied configuration the tank was also used for [[bailout]] in the case of a hose failure. The durations of 6 to 8 hours on a tankful without external supply recorded for the Rouquayrol set in the book ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' by [[Jules Verne]], are wildly exaggerated fiction.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1865: on August the 28th the French Navy Minister ordered the first Rouquayrol-Denayrouze diving apparatus and large scale production started.&lt;ref name="plongeesout.com"/&gt;

===Gas and air cylinders appear===
* Late 19th century: [[Industry]] began to be able to make high-pressure air and [[gas cylinder]]s. That prompted a few inventors down the years to design open-circuit compressed air breathing sets, but they were all constant-flow, and the demand [[Diving regulator|regulator]] did not come back until 1937.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Decompression sickness recognised as a problem===
* 1841: First documented case of decompression sickness occurred, reported by a mining engineer who observed pain and muscle cramps among [[coal miner]]s working in [[shaft mining|mine shaft]]s air-pressurized to keep water out.&lt;ref name="Acott 1999" /&gt;
* 1870: Bauer{{who|date=February 2017}} published outcomes of 25 paralyzed [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] workers.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* From 1870 to 1910 all prominent symptoms/causes of decompression sickness were established: explanations at the time included: cold or exhaustion causing reflex spinal cord damage; electricity caused by [[friction]] on compression; or organ [[wiktionary:Congestion|congestion]] and vascular stasis caused by decompression.&lt;ref name="Acott 1999" /&gt;
* 1871: The [[St Louis]] [[Eads Bridge]] employed 352 compressed air workers including Dr. Alphonse Jaminet as the physician in charge. There were 30 seriously injured and 12 fatalities. Dr. Jaminet himself suffered a case of decompression sickness when he ascended to the surface in four minutes after spending almost three hours at a depth of 95 feet in a [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]], and his description of his own experience was the first such recorded.&lt;ref name="eads_brooklyn" /&gt;
* 1872: The similarity between decompression sickness and [[iatrogenic]] air embolism as well as the relationship between inadequate decompression and decompression sickness were noted by Friedburg.{{clarify|reason= Which Friedberg?|date=February 2017}} He suggested that intravascular gas was released by rapid decompression and recommended: slow compression and decompression; four-hour working shifts; limit to maximum depth 44.1 [[Pounds per square inch|psig]] (4 [[Atmosphere (unit)|ATA]]); using only healthy workers; and recompression treatment for severe cases.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1873: Dr. Andrew Smith first used the term "caisson disease" to describe 110 cases of decompression sickness as the physician in charge during construction of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]].&lt;ref name="eads_brooklyn" /&gt; The project employed 600 compressed air workers. Recompression treatment was not used. The project chief engineer [[Washington Roebling]] suffered from caisson disease. (He took charge after his father [[John Augustus Roebling]] died of [[tetanus]].) Washington's wife, Emily, helped manage the construction of the bridge after his sickness confined him to his home in [[Brooklyn]]. He battled the after-effects of the disease for the rest of his life. During this project, decompression sickness became known as "The [Grecian] Bends" because afflicted individuals characteristically arched their backs: this is possibly reminiscent of a then fashionable women's dance maneuver known as the [[Grecian bend|Grecian Bend]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1878: [[Paul Bert]] published ''La Pression barométrique'', providing the first systematic understanding of the causes of DCS.&lt;ref name="Bert 1878" /&gt;

=== Twentieth century ===
* 1900: [[John P. Holland]] built the first [[submarine]] to be formally commissioned by the U.S. Navy, ''Holland'' (also called ''A-1'').&lt;ref name="Paine 2000" /&gt;
** [[Leonard Erskine Hill|Leonard Hill]] used a frog model to prove that decompression causes bubbles and that recompression resolves them.&lt;ref name="Acott 1999" /&gt;
* 1903: [[Siebe Gorman]] started to make a submarine [[escape set]] in England; in the years afterwards it was improved, and later was called the [[Davis Escape Set]] or [[Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus]].&lt;ref name="rebreather_hx" /&gt;
* from 1903 to 1907: Professor [[Georges Jaubert]], invented Oxylithe, a mixture of [[sodium peroxide|peroxides of sodium]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and potassium with a small amount of salts of copper or nickel, which produces oxygen in the presence of water.&lt;ref name="Larousse" /&gt;
* 1905:
** Several sources, including the 1991 [[United States Navy|US Navy]] Dive Manual (pg 1-8), state that the MK V Deep Sea Diving Dress was designed by the Bureau of Construction &amp; Repair in 1905, but in reality, the 1905 Navy Handbook shows British Siebe-Gorman helmets in use. Since the earliest know MK V is dated 1916, these sources are probably referring to the earlier MK I, MK II, MK III &amp; MK IV [[Morse Diving|Morse]] and [[August Schrader|Schrader]] helmets.&lt;ref name="Lonsdale 2012" /&gt;
** The first rebreather with metering valves to control the supply of oxygen was made.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1907: [[Draegerwerk|Draeger]] of [[Lübeck]] made a [[rebreather]] called the ''U-Boot-Retter.'' (submarine rescuer).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1908: 
**[[Arthur Boycott]], [[Guybon Damant]], and [[John Scott Haldane|John Haldane]] published "The Prevention of Compressed-Air Illness", detailed studies on the cause and symptoms of decompression sickness, and proposed a table of [[decompression stop]]s to avoid the effects.&lt;ref name="Acott 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boycott et al 1908" /&gt;

* 1910: the British [[Robert Davis (inventor)|Robert Davis]] invented his own submarine rescuer rebreather, the [[Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus]], for the Royal Navy submarine crews.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1912: 
** US Navy adopted the [[Haldane's decompression model|decompression tables published by Haldane, Boycott and Damant]]. Driven by Chief Gunner George Stillson, the navy set up a program to test tables and staged decompression based on [[Haldane's decompression model|the work of Haldane]].&lt;ref name="nedu" /&gt;
** [[Maurice Fernez]] introduced a simple lightweight underwater breathing apparatus as an alternative to helmet diving suits.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
** [[Draegerwerk|Draeger]] started the commercialization of his rebreather in both configuration types, mouthpiece and helmet.&lt;ref name="Diving heritage Draeger" /&gt;

* 1918: the "Ohgushi's Peerless Respirator" was first patented. Invented in 1916 by Riichi Watanabi and the blacksmith Kinzo Ohgushi, and used with either surface supplied air or a 150 bar steel scuba cylinder holding 1000 litres free air, the valve supplied air to a mask over the diver's nose and eyes and the demand valve was operated by the diver's teeth. Gas flow was proportional to bite force and duration. The breathing apparatus was used successfully for fishing and salvage work and by the military Japanese Underwater Unit until the end of the Pacific War.&lt;ref name="Ohgushi manual" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Monday 2004" /&gt;
* Around 1920: Hanseatischen Apparatebau-Gesellschaft made a 2-cylinder breathing apparatus with double-lever single-stage demand valve and single wide corrugated [[Breathing tube (in breathing apparatus)|breathing tube]] with mouthpiece, and a "duck's beak" exhalent valve in the regulator. It was described in a [[mine rescue]] handbook in 1930.

Gagnan's boss and owner of the Air Liquide company, [[Henri Melchior]], decided to introduce Gagnan to [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]], his [[son-in-law]], because he knows that Cousteau is looking for an efficient and automatic demand regulator. They met in Paris in December 1942 and adapted Gagnan's regulator to a diving cylinder.&lt;ref name="Musee du Scaphandre 4" /&gt;
* 1943: after fixing some technical problems, Cousteau and Gagnan patented the first modern demand regulator.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
** Air Liquide built two more aqualungs: these three are owned by Cousteau but also at the disposal of his first two diving companions [[Frédéric Dumas]] and [[Taillez]]. They use them to shoot the film ''Épaves'' (''Shipwrecks''), the first underwater film shot using scuba sets.&lt;ref name="Epaves" /&gt;
** In July Commeinhes reached 53 metres (about 174 feet) using his GC42 breathing set off the coast of Marseille.&lt;ref name="Taillez 1954 p52" /&gt;
** In October, and not knowing about Commeinhes's exploit, Dumas dived with a Cousteau-Gagnan prototype and reached 62 metres (about 200 feet) off [[Les Goudes]], not far from Marseille. He experienced what is now called [[nitrogen narcosis]].&lt;ref name="Cousteau and Dumas 1953 p37" /&gt;
* 1944: Commeinhes died in the liberation of [[Strasbourg]] in [[Alsace]]. His invention was overtaken by Cousteau's invention.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* Various nations use [[frogmen]] equipped with [[rebreather]]s for war actions: see [[Human torpedo]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* [[Hans Hass]] later said that during [[World War II|WWII]] the German diving gear firm [[Drägerwerk|Dräger]] offered him an open-circuit [[scuba set]] with a [[demand regulator]]. It may have been a separate invention, or it may have been copied from a captured Commeinhes-type set.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* Early 1944: the USA government, to try to stop men from being drowned in sunken army [[tank]]s, asked the company [[Mine Safety Appliances]] (MSA) for a suitable small escape breathing set. MSA provided a small [[Open-circuit scuba|open-circuit]] breathing set with a small (5 to 7 liters) air cylinder, a circular [[demand regulator]] with a two-lever system similar to Cousteau's design (connected to the cylinder by a nut and cone nipple connection), and one corrugated wide [[Breathing tube (in breathing apparatus)|breathing tube]] connected to a mouthpiece. This set was stated to be made from "off-the-shelf" items, which shows that MSA already had that regulator design; also, that regulator looks like the result of development and not a [[prototype]]; it may have arisen around 1943.&lt;ref name="HDT" /&gt; In an example recovered in 2003 from a submerged [[Sherman tank]] in the [[Bay of Naples]], the cylinder was bound round in tape and tied to a [[lifejacket]]. These sets were too late for the [[D-day]] landings in June 1944, but were used in the invasion of the south of France and in the [[Pacific war]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1944: Cousteau's first aqualung was destroyed by a stray [[artillery]] shell in an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] landing on the [[French Riviera]]: that leaves two.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Postwar===
* The public first heard about [[frogmen]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1945: In [[Toulon]], Cousteau showed the film ''Épaves'' to the Admiral [[André Lemonnier|Lemonnier]]. The Admiral then made Cousteau responsible for the creation of the underwater research unit of the French Navy (the GRS, Groupe de Recherches Sous-marines, nowadays called the CEPHISMER).&lt;ref name="Taillez 1954" /&gt; GRS' first mission was to clear of mines the French coasts and harbours. While creating the GRS, Cousteau only had at his disposal the two remaining Aqua-Lung prototypes made by l'Air Liquide in 1943.&lt;ref name="Cousteau and Dumas 1953" /&gt;
* 1946: 
**Air Liquide created [[Aqua Lung/La Spirotechnique|La Spirotechnique]] and started to sell Cousteau-Gagnan sets under the names of ''scaphandre Cousteau-Gagnan'' ('Cousteau-Gagnan scuba set'), CG45 ("C" for Cousteau, "G" for Gagnan and "45" for 1945, year of their first postwar patent) or [[Aqua-Lung]], the latter for commercialization in English-speaking countries. This word is correctly a [[tradename]] that goes with the Cousteau-Gagnan patent, but in Britain it has been commonly used as a [[Genericized trademark|generic]] and spelt "aqualung" since at least the 1950s, including in the [[British Sub-Aqua Club|BSAC]]'s publications and training manuals, and describing scuba diving as "aqualunging".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
** [[Henri Broussard]] founded the first post-[[World War II|WWII]] scuba diving club, the [[Club Alpin Sous-Marin]]. Broussard was one of the first men who Cousteau trained in the GRS.&lt;ref name="Double hose collection" /&gt;
** [[Yves Le Prieur]] invented a new version of his breathing set. Its fullface mask's front plate was loose in its seating and acted as a very big, and therefore, very sensitive diaphragm for a demand regulator: see [[Diving regulator#Demand valve]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
** The first known underwater diving club in Britain, "The Amphibians Club", is formed in [[Aberdeen]] by Ivor Howitt (who modified an old civilian [[gas mask]]) and some friends. They called underwater diving "[[fathom]]eering", to distinguish from [[diving (sport)|jumping into water]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
** The [[Cave Diving Group]] (CDG) is formed in Britain.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

** [[Georges Beuchat]] in France created the first surface buoy.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1948 or 1949: [[Rene's Sporting Goods]] shop in [[California]] imported aqualungs from France. Two graduate students, Andy Rechnitzer and Bob Dill obtained a set and began to use it for underwater research.  [[Hollywood]] noticed Aqualungs and was interested.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1949: [[William Beebe]] and [[Otis Barton]] made a record dive to 4,500 feet in the [[Benthoscope]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1950: a British naval diving manual printed soon after this said that the aqualung is to be used for walking on the bottom with a heavy diving suit and weighted boots, and did not mention Cousteau.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
** A report to Cousteau said that only 10 aqualung sets had been sent to the USA because the market there was saturated.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
** The first camera housing called Tarzan is released by [[Georges Beuchat]],{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* 1951:
** The movie "[[The Frogmen (1951 film)|The Frogmen]]" was released. It was set in the Pacific Ocean in [[World War II|WWII]]. In its last 20 minutes, it shows USA [[Frogman#Errors about frogmen found in public media|frogmen]], using bulky 3-cylindered aqualungs on a combat mission. This equipment use is [[anachronistic]] (in reality they would have used [[rebreather]]s), but it shows that aqualungs were available (even if not widely known of) in the USA in 1951.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

** [[Ted Eldred]] in Melbourne, Australia started making for public sale the [[Porpoise (make of scuba gear)]]. This was the world's first commercially available single-hose scuba unit and was the forerunner of most sport SCUBA equipment produced today. Only about 12,000 were made.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
** After World War II Lambertsen called his 1940-1944 rebreather LARU (for [[Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit]]) but as of 1952 Lambertsen renamed his invention and coined the acronym SCUBA (for "self-contained underwater breathing apparatus"). During the following years this acronym was used, more and more, to identify the Cousteau-Gagnan apparatus, taking the place of its original name (Aqualung). In Britain the word ''aqualung'', used for any demand-valve-controlled open-circuit scuba set, still continues to be used nowadays; in old times it was sometimes inaccurately for any scuba set including rebreathers.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Public interest in scuba diving takes off===

* 1953: ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' published an article about Cousteau's underwater archaeology at Grand Congloué island near Marseille. This started a massive public demand for aqualungs and diving gear, and in France and America the diving gear makers started making them as fast as they could. But in Britain [[Siebe Gorman]] and [[Heinke (diving equipment makers)|Heinke]] kept aqualungs expensive, and restrictions on exporting [[currency]] stopped people from importing them. Many British sport divers used home-made constant-flow breathing sets and ex-armed forces or ex-industrial rebreathers. In the early 1950s, [[diving regulator]]s made by [[Siebe Gorman]] cost £15, which was an average week's [[salary]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
** After the supply of war-surplus [[frogman]]'s [[Diving suit#Drysuits|drysuits]] ran out, free-swimming diving suits were not readily available to the general public, and as a result many scuba divers dived with their skin bare except for swimming trunks. That is why scuba diving used often to be called skindiving. Others dived in homemade drysuits, or in thick layers of ordinary clothes.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
** After the supply of war-surplus frogman's fins dried up, for a long time fins were not available to the public, and some had to resort to such things as gluing [[marine ply]] to [[plimsolls]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

** Later, [[Submarine Products Ltd]] in [[Hexham]] in [[Northumberland]], England designed round the Cousteau-Gagnan patent and marketed recreational diving breathing sets at an accessible price. This forced [[Siebe Gorman]]'s and [[Heinke (diving equipment makers)|Heinke]]'s prices down and started them selling to the sport diving trade. (Siebe Gorman gave its drysuit the [[tradename]] "Frogman".) Because of this better availability of aqualungs, [[British Sub-Aqua Club|BSAC]] adopted a policy that rebreathers were unacceptable for recreational diving.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}{{Original research inline|date=February 2017}} In the USA, some oxygen diving clubs developed down the years.

(A similar patent was filed in 1838 by William Newton in England.

[Note: The illustration of the apparatus in Newton's patent application is identical to that in Guillaumet's patent application; furthermore, Mr. Newton was apparently an employee of the British Office for Patents, who applied for patents on behalf of foreign applicants.]

In some [[science fiction]] stories, '''total conversion''' may mean higher or complete conversion of matter into energy, or vice versa in some proportion of [[Mass–energy equivalence|''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'']].

==Energy to matter conversion==
[[Positron]] and [[electron]] production: For [[photon]]s at high-energy ([[MeV]] scale and higher), photon-photon collisions can efficiently convert the photon energy into matter in the form of a positron and an electron:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/science/pair-production Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

{{SubatomicParticle|Gamma|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Gamma|link=yes}} →&amp;nbsp; {{SubatomicParticle|Positron|link=yes}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|Electron|link=yes}}

[[Proton]] and [[antiproton]] production: Conventional matter consists of protons and electrons, with electrons having insignificant mass compared to protons. One conventional model for producing protons from energy is extremely high-energy cosmic ray protons collide with nuclei in the interstellar medium, via the reaction: {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}} +  A → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Antiproton}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}} + A.  (A represents an atom, p a proton, and {{SubatomicParticle|Antiproton}} an antiproton.) A portion of the kinetic energy of the initial proton is used to create two additional nuclei: another proton plus an antiproton.

==Matter to energy conversion==
Conventional nuclear reactions such as [[nuclear fission]] and [[nuclear fusion]] convert relatively small amounts of matter only indirectly into useful energy, such as electricity or rocket thrust. For electricity production released nuclear energy in the form of heat is typically used to boil water to turn a turbine-generator.

Possibly matter is almost completely converted into energy in the cores of neutron stars and "black holes" by a process of nuclei collapse resulting in: proton → positron + 938&amp;nbsp;MeV, resulting in a  &gt;450&amp;nbsp;MeV positron-electron jet. Trace nuclei swept up in such a beam would achieve an approximate energy of (nucleus mass/electron mass) × 450&amp;nbsp;MeV, for example an iron atom could achieve about 45&amp;nbsp;TeV. An up to 45&amp;nbsp;TeV atom impacting a proton in the interstellar medium should result in the p + A process described above.

[[Ion]]-electron or positron-electron plasma with magnetic confinement theoretically allows direct conversion of particle energy to electricity by the separation of the positive particles from the negative particles with magnetic deflection. Direct conversion of particle energy to thrust is theoretically simpler, merely requiring magnetically directing a neutral plasma beam. Present lab production of relativistic 5 MeV positron-electron beams mimic on a small scale the relativistic jets from compact stars, and allow small scale studies how different elements interact with 5 MeV positron-electron beams, how energy is transferred to particles, the shock effect of GRBs, and possible direct thrust and electricity generation from neutral plasmas. Lab positron-electron plasmas could be useful for studying compact star jets and other phenomena. However thrust generation or magnetically separating neutral beams for electrical generation will probably only be useful if there is a practical continuous process for generating neutral plasma by nuclear reactions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lasers.llnl.gov/workshops/user_group_2012/docs/7.3_chen.pdf  Lab production of 5MeV positron-electron beams]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''U-Report''' is a free SMS social monitoring tool and real-time information system for community participation, designed to strengthen community-led development, citizen engagement, and positive change. SMS polls and alerts are sent out to U-reporters and real-time response information is collected. Results and ideas are shared back with the community. Issues polled include among others health, education, water, sanitation and hygiene, youth unemployment, HIV/ AIDS, disease outbreaks; social welfare sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undatarevolution.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/U-Report_1Pg_DataRev-1.pdf|title=U-Report Data Review|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative is currently operational in 41 countries and covers more than 3 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ukraine.ureport.in/|title=U-Report|website=ukraine.ureport.in|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Uganda]] became the first country in which [[UNICEF]] launched the U-Report mobile initiative in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unicefstories.org/2014/05/20/ureport-connecting-young-people-to-government/|title=UReport connecting young people to government – Stories of UNICEF Innovation|website=unicefstories.org|language=en-US|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's population is one of the youngest in the world with over 55% of the population younger than 18 years and 78% - up to 30 years. Also there is a high level of using phones - 48%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unicefstories.org/2014/05/20/ureport-connecting-young-people-to-government/|title=UReport connecting young people to government – Stories of UNICEF Innovation|website=unicefstories.org|language=en-US|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of U-Report in Uganda has prompted the launch of similar initiatives in [[Zambia]] in December 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zambiaureport.com/media/downloads/PP_Zambia_UNICEF_U-Report_SMS_pilot_MR260813.pdf|title=Звіт UNICEF по Замбії|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Nigeria]] in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cp-africa.com/2015/10/14/u-report-hits-1-million-responders-in-nigeria/|title=U-Report hits 1 million responders in Nigeria|date=2015-10-14|language=en-GB|work=CPAfrica|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Zambia, U-report was used to accelerate [[Prevention of HIV/AIDS|HIV prevention]] among adolescents and young people. As a result of the U-Report, a significant increase in voluntary [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV testing]] was recorded - 40% compared to an average of 24% before.

In Nigeria, U-Report concentrates [[survey (human research)|survey]]s on social and medical issues. The number of reporters in Nigeria has increased dramatically in subsequent years and Nigeria has become the first country out of 1 million reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cp-africa.com/2015/10/14/u-report-hits-1-million-responders-in-nigeria/|title=1 млн респондентів в Нігерії|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, 15 countries initiated a project with a total number of more than a million reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.unicef.org/innovation/unicefs-u-report-reaches-1-million-registered-users-worldwide/|title=UNICEF’s U-Report Reaches 1 Million Registered Users Worldwide - Stories of Innovation|date=2015-07-10|language=en-US|work=Stories of Innovation|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ukraine]] became the first in [[Europe]] and the world's 18th largest U-Report country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://12marathons.bit.ua/2017/06/u-report/|title=Простые технологии: как U-Report помогает молодым людям отстоять свое мнение – bit.ua|last=bit.ua|first=от|date=2017-06-19|language=ru-RU|work=bit.ua|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation took place on April 23, 2016 in [[Kiev|Kyiv]] with the participation of 1,500 people and the well-known Ukrainian music band Pianoboy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://orest.com.ua/music/543-bekhem-i-pianoboy-prizvali-molodezh-ukrainy-k-proektu-u-report|title=Бэкхем и Pianoбой призвали молодежь Украины к проекту U-Report - OREST|language=ru|work=OREST|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org.ua/ua/informatsiinyi-tsentr/news/3838-u-report|title=ЮНІСЕФ розпочинає в Україні нову молодіжну ініціативу – U-Report — Представництво ООН в Україні|website=www.un.org.ua|language=uk-ua|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the year of activity in December 2016, there were over 25,000 u-reporters in Ukraine with 53% younger than 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dsmsu.gov.ua/index/en/material/28212|title=В Мінмолодьспорту відбулось засідання Наглядової ради проекту ЮНІСЕФ U-Report {{!}} SITE_NAME|website=www.dsmsu.gov.ua|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for September 30 2018, there are 68,273 u-reporters in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ukraine.ureport.in/|title=Офіційний український сайт U-Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last country that joined the project was [[Malawi]], March 28, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unicefstories.org/2018/06/18/u-report-kicks-off-with-football-super-league-in-malawi/ https://www.mbc.mw/index.php/radio-2/item/6033-minister-advises-youth-to-use-social-media-positively|title=Малаві долучилася до проекту U-Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
UNICEF Innovation has been working with SMS systems since 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unicefstories.org/2014/09/22/small-messagesbig-changes-unicef-launches-rapidpro/|title=UNICEF запускає RAPIDPRO|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, when an open source platform called RapidSMS was developed. RapidPro is an open-source platform which allows the implementation of an SMS application without the need of a programmer. It provides real-time information and data analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://community.rapidpro.io/about-rapidpro/|title=About RapidPro|website=community.rapidpro.io|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by the UNICEF global Innovation Centre in collaboration with Nyuruka, a Rwandan software development firm. An additional advantage is the ability to create fields required for a specific context, in each country, different fields for the presentation of identical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://community.rapidpro.io/about-rapidpro/|title=About RapidPro|website=community.rapidpro.io|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two categories of information were identified based on data available from a sample of 6 countries ([[Mali]], [[Burundi]], [[Cameroon]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Central African Republic]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.unicef.org/innovation/discovering-the-endless-possibilities-with-u-report-big-data/|title=Discovering the endless possibilities with U-Report Big Data - Stories of Innovation|date=2015-06-29|language=en-US|work=Stories of Innovation|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; identification (age, gender, occupation) and location ( different administrative levels) and a set of best practices for naming variables.

[[Telegram (service)|Telegram]] was chosen first in early 2016 because it was one of the first messaging applications to provide an open API that allowed organizations to develop and integrate chatbots with other platforms. Telegram, however, had low penetration in the countries where U-Report operates, so it was never used at scale. Later in 2016, U-Report tested the [[Facebook Messenger]] [[Application programming interface|API]] for delivering U-Report surveys. By late 2017, the integration was still at an early stage, but the U-Report team viewed its partnership with Facebook as a critical investment that would result in cost savings to U-Report and U-Reporters because, unlike SMS, there is no per-message cost to use Facebook Messenger. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://messengers.digitalimpactalliance.org/unicef.html|title=Internet Messaging Applications for Development|website=messengers.digitalimpactalliance.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=How To Use Chatbots For Humanitarian &amp; Social Impact Initiatives - TOPBOTS|url=https://www.topbots.com/chatbots-for-social-good/|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, U-Report [[Indonesia]] was launched on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unicefstories.org/2015/12/16/u-report-indonesia-officially-launched/|title=U-Report Indonesia Officially Launched – Stories of UNICEF Innovation|website=unicefstories.org|language=en-US|accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data received can be disaggregated by age, gender, States, LGAs, Wards and settlements in real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undatarevolution.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/U-Report_1Pg_DataRev-1.pdf|title=Звіт U-Report за 2015 рік|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of U-Report in actionis in [[Liberia]] on sexual abuse in schools. To assess the magnitude of the situation, U-Report asked 13,000 users in Liberia whether teachers at their schools were exchanging grades for sex. An astonishing 86% of those polled said yes. Following U-Report’s discovery of a “Sex 4 Grades” epidemic, hotlines across the country were inundated by victims who now felt safe enough to reach out for support.
