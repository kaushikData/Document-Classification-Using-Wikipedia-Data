'''110 Propositions for France''' ({{lang-fr|'''110 Propositions pour la France'''}}) was the name of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]'s program for the [[French presidential election, 1981|1981 presidential election]] during which the Socialist Party's candidate, [[François Mitterrand]], was elected by 51.76% of the people. This program influenced significantly the policies enacted during Mitterrand's two terms (1981–88 and 1988–95).

== Propositions ==

=== International ===

*The 1st Proposition called for the withdrawal of [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet troops]] from [[Afghanistan]].
*The 2nd Proposition called for the "condemnation of the aid given by the [[Latin America–United States relations|United States to Latin American dictatorships]]."
*The 3rd Proposition called for support to Polish workers and respect for "the independence of trade unions" (see [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)]]).
*The 4th Proposition called for "[[List of Middle East peace proposals|Peace in the Middle East]] by the guarantee of [[Israel]]'s security in assured and recognized frontiers, the recognition of the right of the [[Palestinian people]] to a [[state of Palestine|homeland]], and the unity of [[Lebanon]]."
*The 5th Proposition called for the independence of [[Chad]] (then occupied by [[Libya]]), respect for [[Cambodia]]'s sovereignty, and support for the right of [[self-determination]] of [[Eritrea]] and [[Western Sahara]].
*The 6th Proposition called for "progressive and simultaneous [[disarmament]] in order to dissolve military blocs" with the maintenance of the "military balance."
*The 7th Proposition called for international action against [[nuclear proliferation]] and for the reinforcement of control of [[nuclear power plant|nuclear power stations]].
*The 8th Proposition called for the opening of European negotiations on collective security, withdrawal of Soviet [[SS-20 Saber|SS-20 ballistic missiles]] and of US [[MGM-31 Pershing]] missiles from European territory. This was eventually achieved by the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] (INF Treaty) of 1987, signed by US President [[Ronald Reagan]] and USSR head of state [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].
*The 9th Proposition called for the establishment of a "[[New International Economic Order]]." [[Development aid]] to [[Third World]] countries was to be increased to 0.70% of the [[gross national product]] of developed countries. This  has become the standard aim for the European Union and international standards; however, few countries achieve it, including France {{as of|2004|lc=on}}.
*The 10th Proposition called for the definition of a new [[global financial system]] with the reform of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[World Bank]] and of the [[European Currency Unit]].

=== Europe ===
*The 11th Proposition called for the "strict application of the [[Treaty of Rome]]" of 1957, the reinforcement of "democratisation of [European] institutions", the "defense of [[employment]] in Europe" by the establishment of "common industrial policies" and "[[protectionism|protection of sectors]]" threatened by Japanese and American products, and the establishment of common European regulations concerning the activities of [[multinational corporation]]s.
*The 13th Proposition called for the creation of a "[[Union for the Mediterranean|Council of the Mediterranean Peoples]]". The basic scheme for this was drawn up a few months after Mitterrand's death during the 1995 [[Barcelona Conference]].
*The 41st Proposition called for the reform of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]].

=== Employment: Social Growth by Control of Economics ===
The social and economic program was dominated by [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] measures.

*The 16th Proposition called for a "program of [[public works]]" and the construction of [[subsidized housing|social housing]] and communal facilities ([[preschool|nursery school]]s, school restaurants, etc.).
*The 17th Proposition called for the "stimulation of [[research]]," with the aim of having this sector represent 2.5% of GNP by 1985. It also aimed at supporting [[small and medium-sized enterprises]] (SME) by facilitating [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and encouraging [[innovation]].
*The 18th Proposition called for the creation of 150,000 jobs in the [[public sector]] in order to improve conditions of public access to [[health care in France|healthcare]], [[education in France|education]], and the [[La Poste (France)|postal service]]. 60,000 jobs should be created to assist [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s and local administrations.
*The 19th Proposition defined "social growth" as resting on the "dynamism of the public sector", the "encouragement of [[investment]]", the increase of low incomes and improvement of labour conditions.
*The 20th Proposition called for "the defense of the [[French franc|Franc]] against [[speculation]]," while "industrial and agricultural development" was to render growth less dependent on [[import]]s. The role of [[international trade|foreign trade]] in the [[GDP]] was to be decreased to 20% by 1990.
*The 21st Proposition called for the "[[nationalization]] of the nine industrial groups" specified in the Common Program of 1972 (between the Socialist Party, the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] and the [[Radical Party of the Left]]). This led to the [[13 February 1982 law of nationalization]].
*The 22nd Proposition called for the [[Contrat à durée indéterminée|CDI]] (''{{lang|fr|Contrat à durée indéterminée}}'', Indeterminate Length Contract) to become the base of labour relations, as well as for the extension of [[trade union]]s' capacities for involvement in businesses (protection of trade unions' representatives, etc.)
*The 23rd proposition on the reduction of [[35-hour workweek|working time to 35 hour]]s was partly enacted: the legal workweek (excluding overtime, paid at a higher rate) was reduced to 39 hours in 1982. The Socialist Party (PS) would enact the 35-hour workweek only in 2000, during [[Lionel Jospin]]'s [[Plural Left]] government, with the [[Martine Aubry|Aubry laws]].
*The 26th Proposition called for encouragement of [[saving]]s, in particular by the establishment of the [[Livret A]].
*The 27th Proposition called for financial incentives to assist in the realization of the economic and social policies' aims.
*The 28th Proposition called for [[price controls]] where competition "obviously does not work" ([[price gouging]]). The construction of [[supermarket]]s would be regulated.
*The 29th Proposition called for protection of [[handicraft|arts and crafts]] and [[small business]].
*The 31st Proposition called for the increase of the [[Economy of France|SMIC]] [[minimum wage]], as well as of incomes for [[disability|disabled people]] and [[guaranteed minimum income]]s for retired people. [[Unemployment benefits]] would also be increased.
*The 32nd Proposition called for the reduction of [[value-added tax]] on essential goods to 0%.
*The 34th Proposition led to the creation of a [[solidarity tax on wealth]] (ISF). The ISF was abolished in 1986 by [[Jacques Chirac]]'s right-wing government, and re-established in 1988 after Mitterrand's re-election. It also called for a reform of [[inheritance tax]], increasing the burden on larger estates and reducing it on smaller ones.
*The 35th Proposition called for the reduction of direct taxation on lower incomes and its increase for high incomes.

=== Other domestic issues ===
*The 45th Proposition envisioned either the reduction of the presidential [[term of office]] to five years, or the retention of the seven-year term with a ban on re-election. This proposition was not enacted by Mitterrand: indeed, he won re-election in 1988 and served another seven-year term. However, the presidential term was eventually reduced to 5 years after the [[French constitutional referendum, 2000|2000 referendum]] called for by former president Chirac.
*The 47th Proposition on [[proportional representation]] and on the inclusion of 30% of women on each electoral list led to the introduction of proportional representation for legislative elections. However, this measure was ultimately applied only for the [[French legislative election, 1986|1986 general elections]].
*The 51st Proposition called for reinforcement of the [[separation of powers|independence of the judicial branch]] and for the reform of the ''{{lang|fr|[[:fr:Conseil supérieur de la magistrature|Conseil supérieur de la magistrature]]}}'' (CSM). The Constitutional law of 27 July 1983 granted the CSM more independence, and later became articles 64 and 65 of the [[Constitution of France|Constitution]].
*The 52nd Proposition called for the repealing of exceptional judicial procedures (''{{lang|fr|[[:fr:Cour de sûreté de l'État (France)|Cour de sûreté]]}}'', created in 1963 to try crimes against [[national security]]; [[court-martial|courts-martial]] in peacetime), as well as for the repeal of the 1970 Anti-rioter Act and of the [[Alain Peyrefitte|Peyrefitte law]]. These measures were implemented by Justice Minister [[Robert Badinter]].
*The 53rd proposition was enacted, leading to the [[capital punishment in France|abolition of the death penalty]] in 1981 by Justice Minister [[Robert Badinter]].
*The 54th proposition on [[decentralization]] was also enacted, leading to the 1982-83 laws on state decentralization.
*The 56th Proposition called for state support of [[regionalism (politics)|regional identities]].
*The 80th proposition on the [[right of foreigners to vote]] in municipal elections was not enacted.
*The 94th Proposition called for the decentralization and pluralisation of TV and radio and for the creation of a ''{{lang|fr|[[:fr:Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel|Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel]]}}'' (CSA) on which the representatives of the government would be a minority. The rights of ''{{lang|fr|cibistes}}'' ([[citizens band radio]] users) would be recognized.
*The 95th Proposition called for a "guarantee of the independence of the [[Agence France-Presse]] toward the state" and for the application of the 1944 measures on the press.
*The 96th Proposition called for the prohibition of any kind of [[censorship in France|censorship]], including in barracks and prisons.
*The 97th, 98th and 99th Propositions stressed the importance of research and [[culture of France|culture]] (cinematic, theatrical, architectural, musical creations, etc.).
*The 100th Proposition proposed the abolition of the "price liberalization of books". The 1981 [[Lang Law]] enacted it by imposing a single fixed price on books, whatever the retailer (large retailers such as [[Fnac]] had to sell books at the same price as small, individual booksellers).
*The 104th Proposition called for the independence of [[sport]]s from the "powers of money and of the state", thus following [[Léo Lagrange]]'s insight during the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]].

'''Alcatraz Island''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|k|ə|ˌ|t|r|æ|z}}) is located in [[San Francisco Bay]], {{convert|1.25|mi}} offshore from [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name=ebonline&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | title=Alcatraz Island | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/13237/Alcatraz-Island | year=2009 | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small island was developed with facilities for a [[Alcatraz Island Lighthouse|lighthouse]], a military fortification, a military prison (1828), and [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|a federal prison]] from 1934 until 1963.&lt;ref name="Odier"&gt;{{cite book | last=Odier | first=Odier | title=The Rock: A History of Alcatraz: The Fort/The Prison | publisher=L'Image Odier | year=1982 | isbn=0-9611632-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in November 1969, the island was occupied for more than 19 months by a group of [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native Americans]] from San Francisco, who were part of a wave of Native [[activism]] across the nation, with public protests through the 1970s. In 1972, Alcatraz became part of a national recreation area and received designation as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986.

Today, the island's facilities are managed by the [[National Park Service]] as part of the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]]; it is open to tours. Visitors can reach the island in a little under 15 minutes by [[ferry]] ride from Pier 33, located between the [[San Francisco Ferry Building]] and [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco]]. [[Hornblower Cruises]] and Events, operating under the name Alcatraz Cruises, is the official ferry provider to and from the island.

Alcatraz Island is home to the abandoned prison, the site of the oldest operating [[lighthouse]] on the [[West Coast of the United States]], early military [[fortification]]s, and natural features such as [[rock pool]]s and a [[seabird]] colony (mostly [[western gull]]s, [[cormorant]]s, and [[egret]]s). According to a 1971 documentary on the history of Alcatraz, the island measures {{convert|1675|ft}} by {{convert|590|ft}} and is {{convert|135|ft}} at highest point during mean tide.&lt;ref name="docu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqHBkasgNgE|title=This Is An Alcatraz Documentary (Part 1)|publisher=Narrated by [[Howard Duff]]|year=1971|accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total area of the island is reported to be {{convert|22|acre}}.&lt;ref name=ebonline/&gt;

Landmarks on the island include the [[Alcatraz Cellhouse|Main Cellhouse]], [[Alcatraz Dining Hall|Dining Hall]], [[Alcatraz Library|Library]], [[Alcatraz Lighthouse|Lighthouse]], the ruins of the [[Warden's House (Alcatraz Island)|Warden's House]] and [[Social Hall (Alcatraz)|Officers' Club]], [[Parade Grounds]], [[Building 64]], [[Alcatraz Water Tower|Water Tower]], [[New Industries Building]], [[Model Industries Building]],
and the [[Recreation Yard (Alcatraz)|Recreation Yard]].

The first [[Spaniard]] to document the island was Juan Manuel Diaz, who charted San Francisco Bay and named one of the three islands he identified as "La Isla de los Alcatraces," which translates as "The Island of the [[Gannets]]" but is commonly believed to translate as "The Island of the [[Pelican]]s (Spanish for Pelicans is Pelicanos),"&lt;ref name=GNIS&gt;{{Cite GNIS|218080|Alcatraz Island}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.books-about-california.com/Pages/March_of_Portola/March_of_Portola_Chap_05.html |title=The March of Portolá and the Log of the San Carlos – Zoeth S.

Over the years, the Spanish version "Alcatraz" became popular and is now widely used. In August 1827, French Captain Auguste Bernard Duhaut-Cilly wrote "... running past Alcatraze's (Pelicans) Island ... covered with a countless number of these birds. A gun fired over the feathered legions caused them to fly up in a great cloud and with a noise like a hurricane."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Voyage to California, the Sandwich Islands, and Around the World in the Years 1826–1829 |author=Auguste Duhaut-Cilly |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |page=284 |isbn=978-0-520-21752-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brown pelican|California brown pelican]] (''Pelecanus occidentalis californicus'') is not known to nest on the island today. The Spanish built several small buildings on the island and other minor structures.&lt;ref name="docu"/&gt;

===Military garrison===
The earliest recorded owner of the island of Alcatraz is Julian Workman, to whom it was given by [[Mexico|Mexican]] governor [[Pio Pico]] in June 1846, with the understanding that Workman would build a lighthouse on it.&lt;ref name=PBUSDB&gt;{{cite journal |last1=The Rock |year=1915 |title=A Brief History of the Island of Alcatraz |journal=The Rock |volume=1 |issue=January |page=3 |publisher=Improvement Fund, Pacific Branch United States Disciplinary Barracks, Alcatraz, California |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_T1OAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Workman is the baptismal name of [[Workman-Temple family|William Workman]], co-owner of [[Rancho La Puente]] and personal friend of Pio Pico. Later in 1846, acting in his capacity as Military Governor of California, [[John C. Frémont]], champion of [[Manifest Destiny]] and leader of the [[Bear Flag Republic]], bought the island for $5,000 in the name of the [[United States government]] from Francis Temple.&lt;ref name="docu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/expeditionsofjoh02fr/expeditionsofjoh02fr_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "The expeditions of John Charles Frémont" |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sgha.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgha.net/articles/fh.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130112162937/http://www.sgha.net/articles/fh.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 12, 2013 |title=Famous Hauntings |publisher=Sgha.net |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A530641 |title=h2g2 – Alcatraz, San Francisco, California, USA |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, President [[Millard Fillmore]] ordered that Alcatraz Island be set aside specifically as a United States military reservation,&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; for military purposes based upon the U.S. acquisition of California from Mexico following the [[Mexican–American War]].&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/history/Nr/travel/wwIIbayarea/alc.htm |title=Alcatraz-World War II in the San Francisco Bay Area: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary |publisher=Nps.gov |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frémont had expected a large compensation for his initiative in purchasing and securing Alcatraz Island for the U.S. government, but the U.S. government later invalidated the sale and paid Frémont nothing. Frémont and his heirs sued for compensation during protracted but unsuccessful legal battles that extended into the 1890s.&lt;ref name="sgha.net"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt;

[[File:Alcatraz Island Lighthouse Tower.jpg|thumb|150px|The lighthouse tower adjacent to the prison cell house]]Following the acquisition of California by the United States as a result of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] (1848) which ended the [[Mexican–American War]], and the onset of the [[California Gold Rush]] the following year, the [[U.S. Army]] began studying the suitability of Alcatraz Island for the positioning of coastal batteries to protect the approaches to San Francisco Bay. In 1853, under the direction of [[Zealous B. Tower]], the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] began fortifying the island, work which continued until 1858, eventuating in [[Alcatraz Citadel|Fortress Alcatraz]]. The island's first garrison at Camp Alcatraz, numbering about 200 soldiers and 11 cannons, arrived at the end of that year.

When the [[American Civil War]] broke out in 1861, the island mounted 85 cannons (increased to 105 cannons by 1866) in casemates around its perimeter, though the small size of the garrison meant only a fraction of the guns could be used at one time. At this time it also served as the San Francisco Arsenal for storage of firearms to prevent them falling into the hands of [[Copperheads (politics)|Confederate sympathizers]].&lt;ref name="Hannings 2005 36"/&gt; Alcatraz, built as a "heavily fortified military site on the West Coast", formed a "triangle of defense" along with Fort Point and Lime Point, and ensured security to the bay. The island was also the site of the first operational lighthouse on the [[West Coast of the United States]].&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; Alcatraz never fired its guns offensively, though during the war it was used to imprison [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizers and [[privateer]]s on the west coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/Alcatraz.html |title=Historic Posts, Camps, Stations and Airfields: Post at Alcatraz Island |publisher=Militarymuseum.org |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110206060414/http://militarymuseum.org/Alcatraz.html| archivedate= February 6, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military prison====
{{Main|Alcatraz Citadel}}
Because of its isolation from the outside by the cold, strong, hazardous currents of the waters of San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz was used to house Civil War [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs) as early as 1861.

Following the war in 1866, the army determined  the fortifications and guns were being rapidly rendered obsolete by advances in military technology. Modernization efforts, including an ambitious plan to level the entire island and construct shell-proof underground magazines and tunnels, were undertaken between 1870 and 1876 but never completed (the so-called "parade ground" on the southern tip of the island represents the extent of the flattening effort).&lt;ref&gt;''Alcatraz Preservation Project: Exposing the Layers of An American Landmark'' (pamphlet), Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the army switched the focus of its plans for Alcatraz from coastal defense to detention, a task for which it was well suited because of its isolation. In 1867, a brick jailhouse was built (previously inmates had been kept in the basement of the guardhouse), and in 1868, Alcatraz was officially designated a long-term detention facility for military prisoners. The facility was later discontinued for POWs in 1946. Among those incarcerated at Alcatraz were Confederates caught on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]&lt;ref name="docu"/&gt; and some [[Hopi]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] men in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;"The most painful story of resistance to assimilation programs and compulsory school attendance laws involved the Hopis in Arizona, who surrendered a group of men to the military rather than voluntarily relinquish their children. The Hopi men served time in federal prison at Alcatraz". {{cite book |last=Child |first=Brenda J. |title=Boarding School Seasons: American Indian Families, 1900–1940 |publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|date=February 2000 |page=13 |isbn=0-8032-6405-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, the [[Spanish–American War]] increased the prison population from 26 to over 450, and from 1905 to 1907 it was commanded by U.S. Army General [[George W. McIver]]. After the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], civilian prisoners were transferred to Alcatraz for safe confinement. On March 21, 1907, Alcatraz was officially designated as the Western U.S. Military Prison, later Pacific Branch, U.S. Disciplinary Barracks, 1915.&lt;ref name="Hannings 2005 36"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hannings |first=Bud |title=Forts of the United States: An Historical Dictionary, 16th Through 19th Centuries |publisher=McFarland &amp; Co Inc|date=March 2005 |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |page=36 |isbn=978-0-7864-1796-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 construction began on the huge concrete main cell block, designed by Major Reuben Turner, which remains the island's dominant feature. It was completed in 1912. To accommodate the new cell block, the Citadel, a three-story barracks, was demolished down to the first floor, which was actually below ground level. The building had been constructed in an excavated pit (creating a dry "moat") to enhance its defensive potential. The first floor was then incorporated as a basement to the new cell block, giving rise to the popular legend of "dungeons" below the main cell block. The Fortress was deactivated as a military prison in October 1933 and transferred to the [[Bureau of Prisons]].&lt;ref name="Hannings 2005 36"/&gt;

During [[World War I]], the prison held [[conscientious objectors]], including [[Philip Grosser]], who wrote a pamphlet entitled ''Uncle Sam's Devil's Island'' about his experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Grosser, P., Block, H., Blackwell, A. S., &amp; Berkman, A. (1933). ''Uncle Sam's Devil's Island: Experiences of a Conscientious Objector in America during the World War''. Boston&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary===
{{main|Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary}}
[[File:Exterior of the alcatraz jailhouse.JPG|thumb|left|An exterior view of the Alcatraz [[Alcatraz Cellhouse|main cell block]] from the exercise yard.]]

The United States Disciplinary Barracks on Alcatraz were acquired by the [[United States Department of Justice]] on October 12, 1933, and the island became a [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]] in August 1934. Alcatraz was designed to hold prisoners who continuously caused trouble at other federal prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oliver |first=Marilyn Tower |title=Alcatraz Prison in American HIstory |year=1998 |publisher=Enslow Publishers Inc |location=Berkley Heights, NJ |isbn=0-89490-990-8|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 9:40 am on August 11, 1934, the first batch of 137 prisoners arrived at Alcatraz, arriving by railroad from the United States Penitentiary in [[Leavenworth, Kansas]] at [[Santa Venetia, California]], before being escorted to Alcatraz, handcuffed in high security coaches and guarded by some 60 special [[FBI agents]], [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] and railway security officials.&lt;ref name="docu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AH29"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/rock/rock-029.htm|title=For Desperate or Irredeemable Types United States Federal Penitentiary Alcatraz|publisher=A History of Alcatraz Island, 1847–1972, Historic Resources Study|accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the prisoners were notorious bank robbers and murderers.&lt;ref name="docu"/&gt; The prison initially had a staff of 155, including the first warden [[James A. Johnston]] and associate warden [[J. E. Shuttleworth]], both considered to be "iron men".&lt;ref name="docu"/&gt; The staff were highly trained in security, but not rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="docu"/&gt;
[[File:Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary - Cell 181 - Al Capone.jpg|250px|thumb|Cell 181 in Alcatraz where Al Capone was imprisoned]]
During the 29 years it was in use, the jail held some of the most notorious criminals in American history,&lt;ref name="docu"/&gt; such as [[Al Capone]], [[Robert Franklin Stroud]] (the "Birdman of Alcatraz"), [[George "Machine Gun" Kelly]], [[Bumpy Johnson]], [[Rafael Cancel Miranda]] (a member of the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]] who attacked the [[United States Capitol]] building in 1954),&lt;ref name="ESF"&gt;"Former Alcatraz inmate speaks about his time", ''San Francisco Examiner'', by D. Morita; October 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mickey Cohen]], [[Arthur Barker|Arthur R. "Doc" Barker]], and [[Alvin "Creepy" Karpis]] (who served more time at Alcatraz than any other inmate). It also provided housing for the Bureau of Prisons staff and their families.

During its 29 years of operation, the penitentiary claimed that no prisoner successfully escaped. A total of 36 prisoners made 14 escape attempts, two men trying twice; 23 were caught alive, six were shot and killed during their escape, two drowned, and five are listed as "missing and presumed drowned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/escapes1.htm |title=Alcatraz Escape Attempts |publisher=Alcatrazhistory.com |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most violent occurred on May 2, 1946, when a failed escape attempt by six prisoners led to the [[Battle of Alcatraz]].

On June 11, 1962, [[Frank Morris (prisoner)|Frank Morris]], [[John Anglin (criminal)|John Anglin]], and [[Clarence Anglin]] carried out [[June 1962 Alcatraz escape|one of the most intricate escapes ever devised]].

==Post-prison years==
Because the penitentiary cost much more to operate than other prisons (nearly $10 per prisoner per day, as opposed to $3 per prisoner per day at Atlanta),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ocean View Publishing Company |url=http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/rs5.htm |title=A Brief History of Alcatraz, p. 5 |publisher=Alcatrazhistory.com |date= |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and half a century of salt [[water saturation]] had severely eroded the buildings, then [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] ordered the penitentiary closed on March 21, 1963. In addition, citizens were increasingly protesting the environmental effects of sewage released into San Francisco Bay from the approximately 250 inmates and 60 Bureau of Prisons families on the island. That year, the [[United States Penitentiary, Marion|United States Penitentiary]] in [[Marion, Illinois]], on land, opened as the replacement facility for Alcatraz.

===Native American occupation===
{{Main|Occupation of Alcatraz}}
[[File:Alcatraz Island - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|left|A lingering sign of the [[Occupation of Alcatraz|1969–71 Native American occupation]]]]

Alcatraz Island was occupied by Native American activists for the first time on March 8, 1964. The event was reported by, among others, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''.

Beginning on November 20, 1969, a group of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] called [[Alcatraz-Red Power Movement|United Indians of All Tribes]], mostly college students from San Francisco, occupied the island to protest federal policies related to American Indians. Some of them were children of Native Americans who had relocated in the city as part of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]' (BIA) [[Indian termination policy]], which was a series of laws and policies aimed at the assimilation of Native Americans into mainstream American society, particularly by encouraging Native Americans to move away from the [[Indian reservations]] and into cities. A number of employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs also occupied Alcatraz at that time, including Doris Purdy, an amateur photographer, who later produced footage of her stay on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1md5YYKl-9g|title=Occupation of Alcatraz, 11-29-1969|date=November 27, 2008|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The occupiers, who stayed on the island for nearly two years, demanded the island's facilities be adapted and new structures built for an Indian education center, ecology center and cultural center. The American Indians claimed the island by provisions of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)]] between the US and the Sioux; they said the treaty promised to return all retired, abandoned, or out-of-use federal lands to the native peoples from whom they were acquired. Indians of All Tribes then claimed Alcatraz Island by the "[[Doctrine of Discovery|Right of Discovery]]", as indigenous peoples knew it thousands of years before any Europeans had come to North America. Begun by urban Indians of San Francisco, the occupation attracted other Native Americans from across the country, including [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) urban activists from [[Minneapolis]].

[[File:Alcatraz cellhouse, lighthouse and Warden's House ruins.jpg|thumb|left|The Alcatraz cellhouse, lighthouse, and Warden's House, which was burned out during the 1969–71 Native American occupation]] The Native Americans demanded reparation for the many treaties broken by the US government and for the lands that were taken from so many tribes. In discussing the Right of Discovery, the [[historian]] Troy R. Johnson states in ''The Occupation of Alcatraz Island'', that [[indigenous peoples]] knew about Alcatraz at least 10,000 years before any European knew about any part of North America.

During the nineteen months and nine days of occupation by the American Indians, several buildings at Alcatraz were damaged or destroyed by fire, including the recreation hall, the Coast Guard quarters and the warden's home. The origin of the fires is disputed. The U.S. government demolished a number of other buildings (mostly apartments) after the occupation had ended. [[Graffiti]] from the period of Native American occupation is still visible at many locations on the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csulb.edu/~aisstudy/alcatraz/index.html Alcatraz Island] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923165533/http://www.csulb.edu/~aisstudy/alcatraz/index.html |date=September 23, 2006 }}, California State University Long Beach&lt;/ref&gt;

During the occupation, President [[Richard Nixon]] rescinded the Indian termination policy, designed by earlier administrations to end federal recognition of tribes and their special relationship with the US government. He established a new [[Native American self-determination|policy of self-determination]], in part as a result of the publicity and awareness created by the occupation. The occupation ended on June 11, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Indians of All Tribes, ''Alcatraz Is Not an Island'', Berkeley, Wingbow Press, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Today, American Indigenous groups, such as the [[International Indian Treaty Council]], hold ceremonies on the island, most notably, their "Sunrise Gatherings" every [[Columbus Day]] and [[Thanksgiving Day]].

The [[Global Peace Foundation]] proposed to raze the prison and build a peace center in its place. During the previous year, supporters collected 10,350 signatures that placed it on the presidential primary ballots in San Francisco for February 5, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN0465051020080204?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews | title=Voters consider changing Alcatraz to peace center | date=February 4, 2008 | work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed plan was estimated at [[United States dollar|$]]1 billion. For the plan to pass, [[United States Congress|Congress]] would have to have taken Alcatraz out of the National Park Service. Critics of the plan said that Alcatraz is too rich in history to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Locke |first=Michelle |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2008/feb/02/activist_wants_transform_alcatraz_global_peace_cen/ |title=LJWorld.com / Activist wants to transform Alcatraz into global peace center |publisher=.ljworld.com |date=February 2, 2008 |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 6, 2008, the Alcatraz Island Global Peace Center Proposition C failed to pass, with 72% of voters rejecting the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc11.com/politics/15160200/detail.html |title=Elections and Results &amp;#124; KNTV Bay Area |publisher=NBC 11|date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coastal environment of the San Francisco Bay Area has caused deterioration and corrosion of building materials throughout Alcatraz. Beginning in 2011, the [[National Park Service]] began major renovations on the island, including the installation of solar panels on the cell house roof, slope stabilization near the Warden's House and the stabilization and rehabilitation of the outer cell house walls.

==Fauna and flora==

===Habitat===
[[File:Phalacrocorax penicillatus 1.jpg|thumb|[[Brandt's cormorant]] nesting on Alcatraz Island]]
* [[Cisterns]]. A bluff that, because of its moist crevices, is believed to be an important site for [[California slender salamander]]s.
* Cliff tops at the island's north end. Containing a onetime manufacturing building and a [[plaza]], the area is listed as important to nesting and roosting birds.
* The [[power station|powerhouse]] area. A steep embankment where native grassland and creeping [[Elymus (plant)|wild rye]] support a habitat for [[deer mice]].
* [[Tide pools]]. A series of them, created by long-ago quarrying activities, contains still-unidentified invertebrate species and marine algae.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} They form one of the few tide-pool complexes in the bay, according to the report.
* Western cliffs and cliff tops. Rising to heights of nearly {{convert|100|ft|m}}, they provide nesting and roosting sites for seabirds including [[pigeon guillemot]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[Heermann's gull]]s, and [[western gull]]s. [[Harbor seal]]s can occasionally be seen on a small beach at the base.
* The parade grounds. Carved from the hillside during the late 19th century and covered with rubble since the government demolished [[Corrections officer|guard]] housing in 1971, the area has become a habitat and breeding ground for [[black-crowned night heron]]s, [[western gull]]s, [[slender salamander]]s, and [[deer mice]].
* The Agave Path, a trail named for its dense growth of [[agave]]. Located atop a shoreline bulkhead on the south side, it provides a nesting habitat for [[night heron]]s.
* Alcatraz prison and its surroundings.

===Flora===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Alcatraz smt.jpg|thumb|Flowers on Alcatraz]]

Gardens planted by families of the original Army post, and later by families of the prison guards, fell into neglect after the prison closure in 1963. After 40 years, they are being restored by a paid staff member and many volunteers, thanks to funding by the Garden Conservancy and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy. The untended gardens had become severely overgrown and had developed into a nesting habitat and sanctuary for numerous birds. Now, areas of bird habitat are being preserved and protected, while many of the gardens are being restored to their original state.

In clearing out the overgrowth, workers found that many of the original plants were growing where they had been planted – some more than 100 years ago. Numerous heirloom rose hybrids, including a Welsh rose (Bardou Job) that had been believed to be extinct, have been discovered and propagated. Many species of roses, [[succulents]], and [[geraniums]] are growing among apple and fig trees, banks of sweet peas, manicured gardens of cutting flowers, and wildly overgrown sections of native grasses with blackberry and honeysuckle.

[[File:Codex-sangallensis915 196.jpg|thumb|Annales Alamannici in the [[Annales Sangallenses maiores]], starting with the year 709.]]
The '''''Annales Almannici''''', which are also referred to as the '''''Annals of St. Gall''''', provide one of the earliest records of Medieval Europe available.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Rosenberg and Anthony Grafton, ''Cartographies of Time: A History of the Timeline'', 1st ed., Analytic Design (New York, NY: Princeton Architectural Press, 2010). p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt;

They are notable for their short, cursory style and limited narrative.  To the modern scholar, they might appear to be incomplete, and for that reason, of limited value.  However, in recent years, historians such as Hayden White have argued that the style of the chronicles depict a worldview that is distinctly medieval where "things happen to people rather than one in which people do things."  For that reason, they provide insight into the medieval mind and what things the people of the Dark Ages considered important.&lt;ref&gt;H. White, “The value of narrativity in the representation of reality,” Critical Inquiry (1980): p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The core text of the ''Annales Alamannici'' covers the years 709 through to 799.  Spread over several [[Swabia]]n monasteries, the annals were continued independently in several places, in the [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau Abbey]] up to 939 (continued by [[Hermannus Contractus]]), in [[St. Gallen]] up to 926.  The [[Abbey of St. Gall|St. Gallen]] version was continued from 927 to 1059 as the ''[[Annales Sangallenses maiores]]''.

'''Automatic indexing''' is the ability for a [[computer]] to scan large volumes of [[documents]] against a [[controlled vocabulary]], [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], [[thesaurus]] or [[ontology]] and use those controlled terms to [[quickly]] and effectively index large document depositories. As the number of documents [[exponential growth|exponentially]] increases with the proliferation of the [[Internet]], automatic indexing will become essential to maintaining the ability to find relevant information in a sea of irrelevant [[information]]. Automatic Indexing is the process of analyzing an item to extract the information to be permanently kept in an index.

The automated process can encounter problems and these are primarily caused by two factors: 1) the complexity of the language; and, 2) the lack intuitiveness and the difficulty in extrapolating concepts out of statements on the part of the computing technology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Indexing and Abstracting: Fourth Edition|last=Cleveland|first=Ana|last2=Cleveland|first2=Donald|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2013|isbn=9781598849769|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are primarily linguistic challenges and specific problems involve semantic and syntactic aspects of language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
There are scholars who cite that the subject of automatic indexing attracted attention as early as the 1950s, particularly with the demand for faster and more comprehensive access to scientific and engineering literature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advanced Indexing and Abstracting Practies|last=Riaz|first=Muhammad|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|year=1989|isbn=|location=Delhi|pages=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was highlighted by the information explosion, which was predicted in the 1960s&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Automatic Text Summarization|last=Torres-Moreno|first=Juan-Manuel|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2014|isbn=9781848216686|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came about through the emergence of information technology and the World Wide Web. This phenomenon required the development of an indexing system that can cope with the challenge of storing and organizing vast amount of data and can facilitate information access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Language and Information Systems: 13th International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems, NLDB 2008 London, UK, June 24-27, 2008, Proceedings|last=Kapetanios|first=Epaminondas|last2=Sugumaran|first2=Vijayan|last3=Natural Language and Information Systems: 13th International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems, NLDB 2008 London, UK, June 24-27, 2008, Proceedings|first3=Myra|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2008|isbn=3540698574|location=Berlin|pages=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secrets of the Super Net Searchers: The Reflections, Revelations, and Hard-won Wisdom of 35 of the World's Top Internet Researchers|last=Basch|first=Reva|publisher=Information Today, Inc.|year=1996|isbn=0910965226|location=Medford, NJ|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New electronic hardware further advanced automated indexing since it overcame the barrier imposed by old paper archives, allowing the encoding of information at the molecular level.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The automatic indexing is also partly driven by the emergence of the field called [[computational linguistics]], which steered research that eventually produced techniques such as the application of computer analysis to the structure and meaning of languages.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Using Large Corpora|last=Armstrong|first=Susan|publisher=MIT Press|year=1994|isbn=0262510820|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Automatic indexing is further spurred by research and development in the area of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[Self-organization|self-organizing system]] also referred to as thinking machine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Basketball cards''' will feature one or more players of the [[National Basketball Association]], [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]], [[Olympic basketball]], [[Women's National Basketball Association]], [[Women's Professional Basketball League]], or some other basketball related theme. The first basketball cards were produced in 1910, in a series cataloged as ''College Athlete Felts B-33''. The complete series included ten different sports, with only 30-cards being associated with basketball. The cards were issued as a cigarette redemption premium by The number of  packages needed to redeem for the tobacco cards is not known.

The next series of basketball cards were issued in 1911, in two separate series; ''T6 College Series'', measuring approximately 6" by 8", and ''T51 College Series'', measuring approximately 2" by 3". These series included a variety of sports, with only 6-cards being associated with basketball. One card from the T6 series, and five cards from the T51 series. Both series were produced in two variations; one variation reading "College Series", the other, "2nd Series". The cards were acquired in trade for fifteen Murad cigarette coupons. The offer expired June 30, 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beta.beckett.com/item/3005659/Basketball-Set/Collection/1911-Murad-College-Series-T51-/?tab=Overview#tabContent |title=1911 Murad College Series T51 * Card Collection |publisher=Beckett |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basketball cards were not seen again until 1932, when C.A. Briggs Chocolate issued a 31-card set containing multiple sports. In exchange for a completed set of cards, Briggs offered baseball equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beta.beckett.com/item/3005667/Basketball-Set/Collection/1932-C-A-Briggs-Chocolate-/?tab=Overview#tabContent |title=1932 C.A.Briggs Chocolate * Card Collection |publisher=Beckett |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of basketball cards in the set is not known.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2337">'''Bertram de Shotts''' is known locally as a [[giant (mythology)|legendary giant]] that roamed the then village of [[Shotts]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-22433961&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scotland]] in the 15th Century. [[Shotts]] was then a dreary moorland place on the [[Great Road of the Shire]]. The road was an important route for tradesman carrying their wares around [[Scotland]]. Bertram de Shotts habitually savaged packmen and peddlers for treasure carried along the Great Road. Such was the menace of Bertram de Shotts, King [[James IV of Scotland]] ordered his death. Bertram de Shotts was probably in fact seven or eight feet high, yet nonetheless, his presence merited Giant status.

A gripping tale is told how a young man, namely Willielmo De Muirhead,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.motherbedford.com/Muirhead/Muirhead106.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 1st Laird of Muirhead, killed the Giant. With cunning patience he ambushed Bertram de Shotts, immobilising him by slicing both his hamstrings as he lay down to drink at St. Catherine's Well / [[Kate's Well]] in the then known Sallysburgh now [[Salsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;http://doorstephistory.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/bertram-de-shotts/&lt;/ref&gt; Disorientated, Bertram de Shotts was then decapitated in an unpleasant death. A proud, and now wealthy, De Muirhead then carried the blooded head to the King and was rewarded with a 'Hawk's Flight' of land. This land subsequently became Muirhead's Lauchope estate.

A relic of Bertram’s exploits is still to be seen in one of his hide-outs, [[Law’s Castle]], known to old residents as the Giant’s Cup and Saucer. Huge stones they are, standing sentinel in a desolate moorland bowl, in an unutterable silence, brooding and age old.

Despite Bertram de Shotts being a savage thief, the village Shotts is said, with much probability, to have derived its name from the legendary Giant.

Bertram is believed to have lived from around 1467 to 1505.

'''Blockula''' ('''Blåkulla''' in [[Swedish language|modern Swedish]]) was a legendary island where the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]] held his Earthly court during a [[witches]]' [[Sabbath (witchcraft)|Sabbat]]h. This island could only be reached by a magical flight. It was described as "a delicate large Meadow, whereof you can see no end".

There was said to be a large gate located in the meadow that led to a smaller meadow.  In the smaller meadow there stood a house.  In an enormous room in this house: "[…] there stood a very long Table, at which the Witches did sit down: And […] hard by this Room was another Chamber, where there were very lovely and delicate Beds."  

The Devil was dressed "in a gray Coat, and red and blue Stockings: He had a red Beard, a high-crown’d Hat, with Linnen of divers Colours, wrapt about it, and long Garters upon his Stockings". The Devil then "would go with them that he liked best, into a Chamber, where he committed venerous Acts with them: and this indeed all confessed, That he had carnal knowledge of them, and that the Devil had Sons and Daughters by them, which he did Marry together, and they did couple, and brought forth Toads and Serpents."

Blockula plays a major part in the [[witch-hunt]]s described in [[Joseph Glanvill]]'s 1682 work, ''[[Sadducismus Triumphatus]]''. This book detailed Blockula in an Appendix entitled: "True Account of What Happen’d in the Kingdom of Sweden In the Years 1669, 1670, and upwards: In Relation to some Persons that were accused for Witches; and {{sic|hide=yes|Tryed}} and Executed By the King’s Command". 

Blockula is originally the same place as the island [[Blå Jungfrun]], which was in old days called Blåkulla, and since medieval days rumored to be a place were the witches gathered. The perhaps first time Blockula was mentioned in a [[Witch-hunt|witch trial]] by an alleged witch was in 1597, but in reality, it was not until the witch mania of 1668-1676 that the place had any real importance in the persecution of witches.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:0394818237.01. SCLZZZZZZZ .jpg|right|thumb|A typical Busytown street scene.]] --&gt;
'''Busytown''' is a [[Fictional city|fictional town]] inhabited by an assortment of [[anthropomorphic]] [[animal]]s, as depicted in various books by the children's author [[Richard Scarry]]. Main characters of these books include the following: Huckle Cat, [[Lowly Worm]], Mr. Frumble, police Sergeant Murphy, Mr. Fixit, Bananas Gorilla and Hilda Hippo.

In the early 1990s [[Cinar]] produced the animated series ''[[The Busy World of Richard Scarry]]'', based around the inhabitants of Busytown. The series originally aired on [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] in the United States. A board game and a [[Richard Scarry's Busytown|computer game based on Busytown]] were also produced in the 1990s. Another animated series centered on Busytown, ''[[Busytown Mysteries]]'', ran in the late 2000s.

==Characters==
Although the books contain a wide assortment of characters from different countries and backgrounds, there are some who appear in most of the stories as stars or guests making cameo appearances. For example, Huckle Cat, Lowly Worm and Sergeant Murphy, often appear in the illustrations even if they are not mentioned in the text.

The most frequent characters include:

'''The [[Cat]] Family'''

:'''Father Cat''': Runs a [[grocery store]] and is sometimes referred to as '''Grocer Cat''', His first name is John.  He frequently does business with Farmer Alfalfa.  In the cartoon series ''[[The Busy World of Richard Scarry]]'', he works as a [[travel agent]].
:'''Mother Cat''': A typical housewife and mother. She cares for Huckle, Sally, Lowly, and her husband. Mother Cat's first name is Fiona. In the cartoon series ''[[The Busy World of Richard Scarry]]'', she works for the town's Newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Busy World of Richard Scarry - Newspaper Mom|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cqE_3zP8Zo|date=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Huckle Cat''': Their school-age son who is the protagonist of the series. He is 7 years old. Huckle is often shown in the cockpits of planes and flying with Rudolf von Flugel. It is implied that his ambition is to be a pilot when he grows up. (''Huck'' was the nickname for Scarry's son, Richard Scarry Jr.) Huckle Cat has [[red]] spots in [[The Busy World of Richard Scarry]] but he is 8 years old and has [[orange (colour)|orange]] spots in [[Busytown Mysteries]].
:'''Sally Cat''': Huckle's younger sibling. She is 5 years old. In her early appearances she was known as Little Sister. Sally Cat has [[red]] spots in [[The Busy World of Richard Scarry]] but she is 6 years old and has [[orange (colour)|orange]] spots in [[Busytown Mysteries]].
:'''[[Lowly Worm]]''': Huckle's best friend/pet. He often stays with the Cats as a house guest. Although he attends school with the Cat children, Lowly can also be seen in more adult situations, like driving a [[street sweeper]] or working in the operating room of the Busytown [[Hospital]]. Lowly Worm has appeared in [[The Busy World of Richard Scarry]], and [[Busytown Mysteries]].
:'''Grandma Cat''': lives in another town and it requires a journey by plane to visit her. She is a skilled driver.

'''The Pig Family''': Father Pig is a [[house painter]] married to a typical housewife, Mother Pig. They have twin children, Harry and Sally.

'''Sergeant Murphy''': a [[English Cocker Spaniel|cocker spaniel]] [[police]] [[motorcyclist]] who is often present in street and road scenes. He is married and has a little girl named Bridget. He is dedicated to his job and his passion for motorcycles is shown in the fact that he wears his crash [[helmet]] in bed. His name is reflection on the stereotypical Irish-American policeman.

'''Mayor Fox''':  a [[fox]] and the [[Mayor]] of Busytown. He always wears a [[monocle]], [[top hat]] and a ribbon of office.

'''Billy Dog''': a [[hound|hound dog]] who appears to be a [[bullying|bully]] at first, but has a heart of gold. He is good friends with Huckle, Hilda, and Lowly. He later gets glasses and usually wears a red sweater. He's about 6 years old.

'''Rudolf von Flugel''': a [[fox]] pilot who flies a red-coloured [[Germany|German]] [[World War I]] [[monoplane]] and dresses in the uniform of a German officer of the time. He often takes Huckle, Lowly and Little Sister up in his planes, though these flights frequently end in disaster. His name is the German word for wing (Flügel).

'''Smokey, Sparky and Snozzle''': a trio of [[pig]] [[firefighter]]s. Sparky and Snozzle wear a [[saucepan]] and [[colander]] as headgear, and one of them uses a [[trombone]] for a siren.

'''Mr. Fixit''': a [[fox]] repairman who boasts that he can fix anything, but does not often show this ability. He once attempted to fix Mrs. Cat's [[vacuum cleaner]] but it ran on the ceiling instead of the floor. He also fixes a tire on Marvin Mouse's car but the tire deflates. He even fixes Hilda Hippo's toaster but the toaster turns off and two slices of toast went flying.

'''Janitor Joe''': a [[fox]] who is a janitor in most places of Busytown, including, the theatre and Huckle's school.

'''Mr. Frumble''': a clueless [[pig]] who often loses and chases after his hat. He drives a pickle-shaped car and is prone to vehicular accidents. Sometimes he gets traffic tickets from Sergeant Murphy.

'''Wolfgang [[Wolf]]''', '''Benny [[Baboon]]''' and '''Harry [[Hyena]]''': a trio of layabouts who spend their time lazing in the sun or eating or getting into trouble. On one occasion they were deemed suitable enough to [[Exploration of the Moon|fly to the moon]] (with Lowly as a passenger).

'''Bananas [[Gorilla]]''': a [[gorilla]] who can be a thief whose passion for the [[banana|fruit that bears his name]] leads him to steal bunches of them from Grocer Cat, which leads to his pursuit by Sergeant Murphy. Bananas also has many watches on each wrist. He is 23 years old.

'''Miss Honey''': a [[brown bear]] is the school teacher at Busytown. She is ''very'' kind and motherly, and it is implied that she has children of her own, even though they are never explicitly shown or mentioned. Her pupils include the Cat children and Lowly Worm.

'''Nurse Nelly''': a [[cat]] [[nurse]] who often works as Dr. Lion's assistant both at his office and in the hospital.

The '''''Chronique de la Pucelle''''' or '''''Chronique de Cousinot''''' was composed by [[Guillaume Cousinot de Montreuil|Guillaume Cousinot]] (1400-1484), seigneur de Montreuil, the son of Guillaume Cousinot (d. circa 1442) who was chancellor to [[Louis I, Duke of Orléans]]. The younger Cousinot is a major contemporary source for the episode of the [[Hundred Years' War]] that featured the career of [[Joan of Arc]]. 

The careers of father and son were separated, and the two were identified in the 19th century as uncle and nephew by [[Auguste Vallet de Viriville]] (1815-1868), assistant-professor at the [[École Nationale des Chartes|''École des chartes'']], who published the ''Chronique'' in 1859; however, a few years later, the two Guillaume Cousinot were correctly identified as father and son by [[Jules Doinel]] (1842-1902), archivist at the departmental archives of the [[Loiret (département)|Loiret]] in [[Orléans]]. 

The father, Guillaume I Cousinot, was a distinguished lawyer (''avocat'') at the [[Parlement|Parlement de Paris]] at the beginning of the fifteenth century. In 1408, he was selected by [[Valentina Visconti, Duchess of Orléans]] to defend the memory of her late husband [[Louis I de Valois, Duke of Orléans]], assassinated the previous year by [[John the Fearless|Jean sans Peur]], [[Duke of Burgundy]]. Cousinot rose to the occasion and became a chief counsellor to the [[House of Orléans]], for which his worldly goods were confiscated during the eclipse of the Orléans faction by Jean sans Peur. Shortly before the [[Battle of Agincourt]], [[Charles, Duke of Orleans|Charles d'Orléans]], who was taken captive by the English at Agincourt, appointed Cousinot his chancellor. Cousinot administered the affairs of the duchy during Charles' 24-year captivity in England. Eventually [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] compensated Cousinot for his losses with lands in [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] and an ''[[hôtel particulier]]'', the ''hôtel du Grand-Saint-Martin'' in Orléans. 

The elder Guillaume Cousinot was the author of the ''Geste des Nobles'', an historical survey that begins with the distant, legendary origins of France, and gains historical credibility with the reign of [[John II of France]], then carries the career of Joan of Arc as far as [[Troyes]], where the narrative breaks off suddenly and inexplicably before the coronation of Charles VII.

The younger Guillaume Cousinot studied at the [[University of Orléans]] and, in the footsteps of his father, was a counsellor to the king, ''maÎtre des requêtes'' in the king's household and, in 1442, the first president of the ''Conseil delphinal'', the future Parlement of [[Dauphiné]]. He bought the seigneurie of [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]], near [[Vincennes]]. An administrator and trusted diplomat of Charles VII and of his son [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], his career was even more prominent than that of his father. He was taken prisoner by the English after an embassy to Scotland, and was ransomed by Charles VII.

The ''Chronique de la Pucelle'' was first published in 1661, as an anonymous work, by the historian and archivist Denis Godefroy (1615-1681). Its 19th century editor, Vallet de Viriville, kept the original title.

The '''National Museum of Colombia''' ({{lang-es|Museo Nacional de Colombia}}) is the [[National Museum]] of [[Colombia]] housing collections on its [[history of Colombia|history]], [[art of colombia|art]], [[culture of Colombia|culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatarchaeology.com/museum_details.php?museum=Colombian_National_Museum Colombian National Museum], [http://www.greatarchaeology.com/ Great Archaeology].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/South_America/Colombia/Departamento_de_Cundinamarca/Bogota-1579209/Things_To_Do-Bogota-National_Museum-BR-1.html National Museum, Bogotá], [[Virtual Tourist]].&lt;/ref&gt; Located in [[Bogotá]] downtown, is the biggest and oldest [[museum]] in Colombia. The National Museum of Colombia is a dependency of the [[Ministry of Culture (Colombia)|Colombian Ministry of Culture]].

The National Museum is the oldest in the country and one of the oldest in the continent, built in 1823. Its fortress architecture is built in stone and brick. The plant includes arches, domes and columns forming a sort of Greek cross over which 104 prison cells are distributed, with solid wall façade. It was known as the Panóptico (inspired by the [[Panopticon]] prison) and served as a prison until 1946. In 1948, the building was adapted for National Museum and restored in 1975. 
[[File:55 - Bogota - Décembre 2008.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Colombian mummy displayed in the museum]]
The museum houses a collection of over 20,000 pieces including works of art and objects representing different national history periods. Permanent exhibitions present archeology and ethnography samples from Colombian artefacts dating 10,000 years BC, up to twentieth century indigenous and afro- Colombian art and culture. Founders and New Kingdom of Granada room houses Liberators and other Spanish iconography; the round room exhibits a series of oleos from Colombia painting history.

Paintings by masters [[Débora Arango]], [[Fernando Botero]], [[Enrique Grau]], [[Ignacio Gomez Jaramillo]], [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], [[Alejandro Obregón]], [[Omar Rayo]], [[Andrés de Santa María]], and Guillermo Wiedemann are part of the Permanent Collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5207">'''Colon classification''' ('''CC''') is a system of [[library classification]] developed by [[S. R. Ranganathan]]. It was the first ever [[Faceted classification|faceted]] (or analytico-synthetic) [[Taxonomic classification|classification]]. The first edition was published in 1933. Since then six more editions have been published. It is especially used in [[library|libraries]] in [[India]].

Its name "colon classification" comes from the use of [[Colon (punctuation)|colons]] to separate facets in class numbers. However, many other classification schemes, some of which are completely unrelated, also use colons and other [[punctuation]] in various functions.

In CC, facets describe "personality" (the most specific subject), matter, energy, space, and time (PMEST).  These facets are generally associated with every item in a library, and so form a reasonably universal sorting system.&lt;ref&gt;GOPINATH (M A). Colon classification: Its theory and practice.

-
3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, the subject "research in the cure of tuberculosis of lungs by x-ray conducted in India in 1950" would be categorized as:

:Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research.India'1950

This is summarized in a specific call number:

:L,45;421:6;253:f.44'N5

== Organization ==

The colon classification uses 42 main classes that are combined with other letters, numbers and marks in a manner resembling the [[Library of Congress Classification]] to sort a publication.

=== Facets ===

CC uses five primary categories, or facets, to further specify the sorting of a publication. Collectively, they are called ''PMEST'':

:&lt;nowiki&gt;,&lt;/nowiki&gt; Personality, the most specific or focal subject.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Matter or property, the substance, properties or materials of the subject.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Energy, including the processes, operations and activities.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;.&lt;/nowiki&gt; Space, which relates to the geographic location of the subject.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; Time, which refers to the dates or seasons of the subject.

=== Classes ===

The following are the main classes of CC, with some subclasses, the main method used to sort the subclass using the PMEST scheme and examples showing application of PMEST.

== Example ==

A common example of the colon classification is:

* "Research in the cure of the tuberculosis of lungs by x-ray conducted in India in 1950s":
* Main classification is Medicine
** (Medicine)
* Within Medicine, the Lungs are the main concern
** (Medicine,Lungs)
* The property of the Lungs is that they are afflicted with Tuberculosis
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis)
* The Tuberculosis is being performed (:) on, that is the intent is to cure (Treatment)
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment)
* The matter that we are treating the Tuberculosis with are X-Rays
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray)
* And this discussion of treatment is regarding the Research phase
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research)
* This Research is performed within a geographical space (.) namely India
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research.India)
* During the time (') of 1950
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research.India'1950)
* And translating into the codes listed for each subject and facet the classification becomes
** L,45;421:6;253:f.44'N5

[[File:Gaelic British Isles.jpg|thumb|Map of the Gaelic-speaking world. The red area shows the maximum extent of [[Old Irish]]; the orange area shows places with [[Ogham]] inscriptions; and the green area are modern Gaelic-speaking areas.]]
{{IPA notice}}
Although '''Scottish Gaelic and Irish''' are closely related as [[Goidelic]] [[Celtic languages]] (or Gaelic languages), they are different in many ways. While most [[dialect]]s are not immediately [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually comprehensible]] (although many individual words and phrases are), speakers of the two languages can rapidly develop [[mutual intelligibility]].

==Phonetic and grammatical differences==

[[Scottish Gaelic]] in [[Islay]] and [[Argyll]] is fairly similar to [[Irish language|Irish]]. {{Citation needed|reason=according to who?|date=December 2017}} The extinct dialects of northeast [[Ulster]], particularly [[Rathlin Island]], were also close to Scottish Gaelic. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In Scotland, dialects also existed in southern [[Kintyre]] and [[Galloway]] which were probably similar to Irish, ''sliabh'' (mountain) being fairly common as an element in Galloway and Irish placenames, but quite rare in the Highlands.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} The dialects of these Scottish and Irish regions are also, in turn, the most similar to [[Manx language|Manx]].

While the dialects of northern Scotland and southern Ireland tend to differ the most from one another in terms of vocabulary, they do share some features which are absent in other dialect areas lying between them. For example, in both [[Munster Irish]] and the Gaelic of the north of Scotland, historically short vowels have been diphthongised or lengthened before long sonants. An example of this is the word ''clann'' meaning "children of the family". In Munster Irish and northern Scottish Gaelic it is pronounced {{IPA|[kɫaunˠ]}} whereas in Ulster and [[County Mayo]] it is {{IPA|[kɫanˠ]}} and in [[Connemara]] {{IPA|[kɫɑːnˠ]}}; the Manx form ''cloan'' is {{IPA|[kɫaunˠ]}} in the north and {{IPA|[kɫoːdnˠ]}} in the south. Similarly, ''im''  meaning "butter" is pronounced {{IPA|[iːmʲ]}} in [[Munster]], Southern [[Connacht]] and northern Scotland (and Manx), but {{IPA|[imʲ]}} in Ulster and Southern Scottish.

In addition, slender coronal stops ({{IPA|/tʲ/}} and {{IPA|/tʲʰ/}} in Scottish Gaelic; {{IPA|/tʲ/}} and {{IPA|/dʲ/}} in Irish, are affricated (such as {{IPA|[tʃ]}} and {{IPA|[dʒ]}}) in Mayo&lt;ref&gt;de Búrca, Seán (1958), The Irish of Tourmakeady, Co. Mayo, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, {{ISBN|0-901282-49-9}} pp=24–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mhac an Fhailigh, Éamonn (1968), The Irish of Erris, Co. Mayo, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, {{ISBN|0-901282-02-2}} pp=36–37&lt;/ref&gt; and Donegal,&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Heinrich (1959), Gaeilge Theilinn (in Irish), Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, {{ISBN|1-85500-055-5}} pp=9–10&lt;/ref&gt; the southern Highlands and in Manx, but not in Munster or the northern Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Dochartaigh, C. ''Survey of the Gaelic Dialects of Scotland I-V'' Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (1997) {{ISBN|1-85500-165-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the verb ''tá'' of Standard Irish, northern Scotland and Central-Southern Munster agree in [[lenition|leniting]] the initial ''t'', thus one hears ''thá'' in [[County Waterford]] and [[County Tipperary]], and ''tha'' in northern Scotland.  West Munster also lenites the ''t'', but only after the preverb ''a'' "that" (''an fear a thá ina sheasamh ag an ndoras'' "the man that's standing at the door", standard Irish ''an fear atá ina sheasamh ag an doras'', Scottish Gaelic ''am fear a tha na sheasamh aig an doras'').

The closest to Scottish Gaelic in modern Irish is the dialect currently spoken in [[County Donegal]], as illustrated by the sentence "How are you?".

:[[Scottish Gaelic]] — ''Ciamar a tha sibh?'' (plural/formal) or ''Ciamar a tha thu?'' (singular/informal), Lewis dialect ''Dè mar a tha sibh?'' (plural/formal) ''Dè mar a tha thu?'' (singular/informal) (dè &lt; cad è)
:[[Ulster Irish]] — ''Cad é mar atá sibh?'' (plural) ''Cad é mar atá tú?'' (singular), spelt in 'dialect spelling' as ''Caidé mar a tá sibh/tú?''
:[[Connacht Irish]] — ''Cén chaoi a bhfuil sibh?'' (plural), ''Cén chaoi a bhfuil tú?'' (singular), in colloquial speech ''Ce chuil sib/tú''
:[[Munster Irish]] — ''Conas táthaoi'' (plural), ''Conas taoi?'' (singular), ''Conas tánn sibh/tú?'', ''Conas atá sibh/tú?''

''Sibh'' is used in both Scottish Gaelic and Irish for the plural "you", while Scottish Gaelic [except for the far south] also uses ''sibh'' as a formal version of "you" (much like French uses ''vous''; see "[[T–V distinction]]"). Modern Irish does not use this formal/informal distinction when addressing people.  The use of ''sibh'' as 'polite' you is a retention from the Classical Irish usage of the plural personal pronouns to refer to the singular in polite communication, thus ''sinn'' "we" for ''mé'' "I, me" and ''sibh'' "you (plural)" for ''tú'' "you/thou". ''Thu'' is used in Scottish Gaelic when speaking to an individual friend, family member, or a younger person.

The negative particle in Scottish Gaelic, Manx and Northern Ulster Irish is ''cha/chan'' (''chan eil'', ''cha bhfuil/chan fhuil'' = "is not"; ''chan'' is from the Old Irish emphatic negative '''nichon'''). In standard Irish the negative particle is ''ní'' (''níl'' = "is not", a contraction of ''ní fhuil''); ''ní'' is a retention of the normal Old Irish negative; these are illustrated by the sentence "I have no money":

:Scottish Gaelic — ''Chan eil airgead agam.''
:Ulster Irish — ''Chan fhuil/Cha bhfuil airgead agam.''
:Manx – ''Cha nel argid aym.''
:Standard Irish — ''Níl airgead agam.''

Scottish Gaelic speakers may also sound as if they were using the Irish phrase, as ''Chan eil'' can frequently be shortened to '' 'n eil''.

The Classical Irish digraph ''éu'' [eːʷ] is still used in Scottish Gaelic spelling but is now obsolete in Irish, except in southern dialect writing, as a means to distinguish the vowel ''é'' when followed by a broad consonant from the regular dialect development ''é'' to ''i'' in the same environment, thus ''éan'' [ian] "bird" in comparison to ''d'éug'' [dʲe:g] "died; passed on"). ''Éa'' is now used instead of ''eu'' in Standard Irish. Both ''éa'' and ''éu'' existed in Classical Irish, to a large extent showing nominal case differences (with ''éu'' varying with ''éo'' in the dative of "éa"-words), however in both [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]], [[spelling reform]]s and standardisation (which took place in Ireland under the auspices of the [[government of Ireland]] during the 20th century, and much earlier in Scotland) independently went for different versions.

At times Scottish writers used the spelling ''eu'' to represent how the combination is pronounced in northern dialects, thus ''ia'', writing ''ian'' instead of ''eun'', before this sound change became the typical pronunciation. Manx spelling, based mainly on English, shows that ''ia'' is also the underlying form in Manx, the word being spelled ''eean''.

===Eclipsis===
The most obvious phonological difference between Scottish Gaelic and Irish is that the phenomenon of [[Irish initial mutations#Eclipsis|eclipsis]] in Irish is [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] (i.e. the result of an historical word-final nasal that may or may not be present in modern Irish) but fully [[Synchrony and diachrony|synchronic]] in Scottish Gaelic (i.e. it requires the actual presence of a word-final nasal except for a tiny set of frozen forms). Eclipsis is shown in the Irish orthography but not in Scottish Gaelic as it is conditioned by the actual environment.

For example, this means that phrases like Standard Irish {{lang|ga|ag an doras}}, standard Scottish Gaelic {{lang|gd|aig an doras}}&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;, Manx {{lang|gv|ec y(n) dorrys}} is pronounced as follows in different parts of the Gaelic speaking world:

*Southern Irish : {{IPA-ga|ɪɡə(n̪ˠ)ˈn̪ˠɔɾˠəsˠ, ɡɛ(n̪ˠ)ˈn̪ˠɔɾˠəsˠ|}}
*Western and Northern Irish: {{IPA-ga|ɛɡə(n̪ˠ)ˈd̪ˠɔɾˠəsˠ|}}
*Scottish Gaelic (casual pronunciation, especially [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]]): {{IPA-gd|ɛkʲ ə ˈn̪ˠɔɾəs̪|}}, more often {{IPA-gd|ɛkʲ ə(n̪ˠ) ˈt̪ɔɾəs̪|}}&lt;ref&gt;Gàidhlig Uidhist a Deas: (Téacsleabhar). 58. Gordon Mac Gill-Fhinnein. Institiúid Árd-Léinn Bhaile Átha Cliath, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of diachronic-type eclipsis are the numbers:
*Irish: {{lang|ga|bliana}} "year" &gt; {{lang|ga|ocht mbliana}} "8 years"
*Scottish Gaelic: {{lang|gd|bliadhna}} &gt; {{lang|gd|ochd bliadhna}}

One example of this is the Gaelic "joke" of non-native speakers confusing {{lang|gd|a mbod}} {{IPA|[əˈmod]}} "the penis" with {{lang|gd|am mòd}} {{IPA|[əmˈmɔːd]}} "the meeting/get-together" (similar in sentiment to the English speakers' "joke" about non-native speakers confusing "shit" and "sheet")

&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;In conservative speech, Scottish Gaelic feminine nouns also slenderise in the [[Dative case|dative (prepositonal) case]], giving {{lang|gd|aig an uinneig}}, and so a different final consonant. This feature is uncommon today except in more formal registers and is ignored here.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.akerbeltz.org/index.php?title=Feminine_nouns|title=Feminine nouns - Goireasan Akerbeltz|website=www.akerbeltz.org|language=gd|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthographic differences==
There are a number of distinctive [[Orthography|orthographical]] (written) differences. The spellings of both languages have been reformed in recent decades, which has led to further divergence, though conversely more recent spelling reforms in Scottish Gaelic have reduced the divergences to some extent.

One difference is that the accent is written as a [[grave accent]] ({{lang-gd|links=no|stràc throm}}, "heavy stroke/accent") in Scottish Gaelic, as opposed to the [[acute accent]]  ({{lang-ga|links=no|síneadh fada}}, "length accent"; {{lang-gd|stràc gheur|links=no}}, "sharp stroke/accent") used in Irish; hence the word for "welcome" is written as {{lang|gd|fàilte}} in Scottish Gaelic and in Irish as {{lang|ga|fáilte}}. Irish has no grave accent, only acute accents, while until recently Scottish Gaelic had both grave and acute accents which were used to differentiate between open and closed vowel sounds. However, recent spelling reform has meant that there are now only grave accents in Scottish Gaelic, the opposite of Irish.

Similarly, in Scottish Gaelic the prefix {{lang|gd|h-}} is always hyphenated, while in Irish it is attached to the beginning of the word, as illustrated by the languages' respective names for each other:
:Scottish Gaelic — {{lang|gd|Gàidhlig (na '''h-'''Alba)}}, {{lang|gd|Gàidhlig na '''h-'''Èireann}}
:Standard Irish — {{lang|ga|Gaeilge na '''h'''Alban}}, {{lang|gd|Gaeilge (na '''h'''Éireann)}}
Additionally, while the prefixes {{lang|gd|n-}} and {{lang|gd|t-}} are usually hyphenated in both languages, in Irish they are attached to the beginning of words whose first letter is capitalised (in Scottish Gaelic they are always hyphenated).

A number of letter combinations are possible in written Irish which are not found in Scottish Gaelic e.g. "ae", "bhf". Irish uses "cht" where Scottish Gaelic uses "chd", although "chd" itself was once common in written Irish, as was "cht" in Scottish Gaelic – both being used in Classical Gaelic.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In the combinations "sc"/"sg" and "st"/"sd", Irish now uses "sc" and "st", while Scottish Gaelic uses "sg" and both "sd" and ''st''.&lt;ref name="sqa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scottish Qualifications Authority|title=Gaelic Orthographic Conventions|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most obvious differences in spelling result from the deletion of silent [[lenition|lenited]] digraphs (mainly ''dh'', ''gh'', and ''th'') in Irish in spelling reforms, which was only sometimes done in Scottish Gaelic. Overall, Scottish Gaelic orthography is more conservative than that of Irish.

[[File sharing]] is a method of distributing [[electronically stored information]] such as [[computer program]]s and [[digital media]]. Below is a list of file sharing applications, most of them make use of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] technologies.

This comparison contains next to file sharing applications also [[download manager]]s that can be used as file sharing applications (using the torrent-protocol). For pure download managers see the [[Comparison of download managers]].

Note: BitTorrent-only clients have another comparison page (linked in section "Others comparison pages").

'''Declaration on [[Latvian Legion]]naires in World War II''' ({{Lang-lv|Deklarācija par latviešu leģionāriem Otrajā pasaules karā}}) was adopted by the sixth [[Saeima]] in its second-to-last meeting on October 29, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.diena.lv/arhivs/pienem-deklaraciju-par-legionariem-10348393 |title=Pieņem deklarāciju par leģionāriem |author=Juris Tihonovs |publisher=''[[Diena]]'' |language=Latvian |date=30 October 1998 |accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Saeima composed of 100 MPs, 50 votes were cast in favour, 8 against. The rapporteur MP, Jānis Mauliņš, said before the vote, that “this decision will be our position towards our soldiers who truly fought for the independence of Latvia”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saeima.lv/steno/st_98/st2810.html Latvijas Republikas 6.Saeimas rudens sesijas četrpadsmitā sēde 1998.gada 29.oktobrī]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration was answered with criticism by the [[State Duma|lower house of the parliament of Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestpravo.com/rossijskoje/di-akty/n0a.htm Обращение Государственной Думы Федерального Собрания Российской Федерации "К Сейму Латвийской Республики"]{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|its foreign ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160624022945/http://archive.mid.ru//bdomp/dip_vest.nsf/99b2ddc4f717c733c32567370042ee43/2d4ef90776fbd644c3256887004dff02%21OpenDocument  ЗАЯВЛЕНИЕ ПРЕДСТАВИТЕЛЯ МИД РОССИИ 3 ноября]{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a draft of another declaration, revoking the 1998 declaration, was submitted to the Saeima. It was rejected, by 63 votes to 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saeima.lv/steno/Saeima9/070315/Balsoj/003.htm Par lēmuma projekta ar dok. nr.628 nodošanu komisijām]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, members of the Saeima from the [[National Alliance (Latvia)|National Alliance]] filed a question to the prime minister asking how the resolutive part of the declaration - "the Latvian government is obliged to do the following: 1) demand the occupying countries and their successors in title to observe international law and pay Latvian citizens, their family members and heirs compensation for losses incurred as a result of illegal impressment into the armies of the occupying countries; 2) prevent insults against the honour and dignity of Latvian soldiers in Latvia and abroad." - gets implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://titania.saeima.lv/LIVS10/SaeimaLIVS_LmP.nsf/0/23ae493815294df7c225784f0029d829/$FILE/8_4-2-34-2011.pdf Deputātu jautājums Nr. 14/J10]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Delmas Treason Trial''' (1985&amp;ndash;1988) in [[South Africa]] was the prosecution of 22 anti-[[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] activists under security laws, with the intention of suppressing the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] (UDF).&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Gerhard, Gail.

'''''Doki Doki Literature Club!''''' is a 2017 American [[visual novel]] developed by Team Salvato for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ddlc.moe/|title=Doki Doki Literature Club!|website=ddlc.moe|access-date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story follows a male high school student who joins the school's Literature Club and interacts with its four female members. The game features a mostly linear story, with some alternate scenes and endings depending on the choices the player makes. While it appears at first glance to be a lighthearted [[Dating sim|dating simulator]], it is in fact a [[psychological horror]] game that involves heavy use of breaking the [[fourth wall]].&lt;ref name=polygon1&gt;{{cite web|title=Doki Doki Literature Club is an uncontrollably horrific visual novel|last=Rose|first=Victoria|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/22/16512204/doki-doki-literature-club-pc-explained|publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=October 22, 2017|accessdate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doki Doki Literature Club is a hidden horror game for the internet age|last=Josuweit|first=Amy|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/10/31/doki-doki-literature-club-horror-game/|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=October 31, 2017|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was developed in an estimated two-year period by a team led by Dan Salvato, known previously for his modding work for ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]''. According to Salvato, the inspiration for the game came from his mixed feelings toward [[anime]], and a fascination for surreal and unsettling experiences.&lt;ref name=interview /&gt; Upon its release, ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' received critical praise for its metafictional and horror elements, with ''[[PC Gamer]]'' calling it "one of the most surprising games of the year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doki Doki Literature Club! hides a gruesome horror game under its cute surface|last=Wright|first=Steven|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doki-doki-literature-club-hides-a-gruesome-horror-game-under-its-cute-surface/|publisher=[[PC Gamer]]|date=October 26, 2017|accessdate=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:DDLCPoemCreation.jpg|left|thumb|The poem writing mini-game in ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'']]
''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' is a visual novel, as such, the majority of the gameplay consists of the player reading the game's story with little impact on what direction the plot takes. At certain points in the game the player is prompted to make decisions which may affect how the story progresses. The game also features a poetry writing mechanic as part of the Literature Club.&lt;ref name=polygon1 /&gt; The player is given a list of various words to select from that will make up their poem. Each girl in the Literature Club has different word preferences, and will react when the player picks a word that they like. The player is able to create poems for only three of the four girls, which serves as a plot point in the game. Additional scenes can be unlocked for each girl if the player writes poems targeted at that girl's tastes, and chooses the correct dialogue options. If the player goes through all of the options, they will unlock an alternate ending. At one point in the game, the player is required to access the game's files and delete a specific file in order to progress further; throughout the game, files will be added and deleted automatically from the game.

==Plot==
The protagonist is invited by his childhood friend, Sayori, to join their high school's literature club. The protagonist then meets the other members of the club: Natsuki, Yuri, and the club president Monika.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get to Know Your Fellow Lovers Of Writing With Doki Doki Literature Club!|last=Couture|first=Joel|url=https://www.siliconera.com/2017/10/13/get-know-fellow-lovers-writing-doki-doki-literature-club/|publisher=Silicon Era|date=October 13, 2017|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist starts to participate in the club's activities such as writing and sharing poetry, and grows close to the four girls. Many of the poems written by the four girls foreshadow or hint at their troubled home life, or depressed state.

Whilst preparing for an upcoming school festival, Sayori reveals that she suffers from depression and confesses her love for the protagonist. As the day of the festival approaches, Sayori's usually bittersweet poem is replaced with a dark and morbid note repeatedly telling someone to get out of her head. When Sayori does not answer his text messages, the protagonist leaves the club meeting and rushes to Sayori's home, where he discovers that she has &lt;!-- NOT "hung". See the page [[Hanging]]: "In this specialised meaning of the common word hang, the past and past participle is hanged instead of hung." --&gt;hanged herself. The game begins to glitch, and as the protagonist wonders if they could have saved Sayori, the game abruptly ends.

The player is sent back to the main menu, with all previous save files erased. The game starts as usual, but what used to be Sayori's text and name is replaced with unreadable text. The game suddenly glitches and restarts; however, Sayori is absent, and any previous references to her are either completely removed or replaced by glitches and meshes of portions of other characters' sprites. Monika instead invites the protagonist to the club. Unsettling events begin occurring: the game rewinds after the protagonist finds Yuri cutting herself, features disturbing bad endings such as Natsuki’s neck snapping, and refuses to accept dialog options that do not favor Monika. Yuri becomes increasingly psychotic and obsessive towards the protagonist, brutally insulting Natsuki and Monika and trying to keep the protagonist with her. Just before the festival, Yuri presents the protagonist with a stained, illegible poem, and apparitions of a faceless Natsuki appear. Yuri later confesses her love to the protagonist, then stabs herself to death, out of grief or excitement, depending on whether the protagonist accepted her confession. Due to another glitch, the protagonist unwittingly spends the weekend sitting by her body. On Monday, Natsuki enters, vomits at the sight of Yuri's corpse, and flees. Monika then appears, apologizes, and deletes the "character files" for Yuri and Natsuki, causing the game to restart once again.

After being automatically taken to a new file, the protagonist is placed in a room with Monika seated across from them. Monika explains that she is aware that she is a character in a game, and that she is able to manipulate the game's files to alter the other characters' personalities or erase them altogether. She admits to making Sayori "more and more depressed" and "amplifying Yuri's [[Yandere|obsessive personality]]" to make them more unlikable so the player would focus on her instead, having had an identity crisis from not being designed as a potential love interest. She confesses her love directly not to the protagonist, but to the player. Monika will sit and talk to the player indefinitely about various topics until the player manually enters the game's directory and deletes Monika's character file. Upon doing this, the game glitches once more and Monika panics as she is deleted from the game's world. Monika initially lashes out at the player, but after a pause, she confesses that she still loves the player, and expresses regret for everything she has done. Monika then restores the other girls, and removes herself from the game.

===Possible endings===
Choices the player can make in the playthrough can lead to three possible conclusions.

The first (and default) ending, following Monika's removal from the directory, the game starts over once again with Sayori, Yuri and Natsuki all alive, playing out similarly to the initial playthrough. Shortly after meeting everyone, Sayori tells the player that now that she is the president of the literature club, she knows everything about the game and what happened with Monika, and intends to do the same thing Monika did. Monika immediately intervenes once more via text prompt and deletes Sayori to save the player. Monika then speaks audibly to the player, and sings a song titled "Your Reality" to the player while the credits roll and Monika slowly deletes the game. After the credits, the game displays a note from Monika, stating that she has disbanded the literature club because "there is no happiness" in it.

Another possible ending may take place if Monika's character file is prematurely deleted before starting a new game, resulting in Sayori becoming the default leader of the club. Upon realizing the true nature of the game and her role in it, Sayori will panic and hijack the controls, deletes all the character files, and forcefully closes it. Opening the game again will result to a black end screen followed by an image of Sayori hanging herself, staying with the screen after 10 minutes will reveal a message — "Now everyone can be happy." 

However, an alternate ending may occur if the player has viewed all of the optional scenes in a single playthrough, which requires saving and loading at several points before witnessing Sayori's initial suicide. Sayori instead accepts the nature of her reality and tearfully expresses her gratitude to the player for trying to make all of the girls happy. She bids goodbye, hoping that the player will visit once again sometime and concluding that the girls all love the player before deleting the game herself. After the credits, which also feature "Your Reality", the player is presented with a thank-you note from the game's developer, Dan Salvato.

In all outcomes, further playthroughs require the game to be re-installed or hard reset.

==Development and release==
Dan Salvato spent an estimated two years working on ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' in secret before releasing it as his first game.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Prior to its release, Salvato was known for creating the ''FrankerFaceZ'' extension for [[Twitch.tv]],&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; his [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]] work in the ''[[Super Smash Bros]]'' scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Powerful mod adds replay feature to Super Smash Bros.

''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' was first released on September 22, 2017 on [[itch.io]], and was later also released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doki Doki Literature Club! on Steam|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/698780|publisher=[[Valve Corporation]]|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is available as [[freeware]] with an optional [[pay what you want]] model. Paying US$10 or more unlocks a bonus "Fan Pack" that includes desktop and mobile wallpapers, the game's official soundtrack, and a digital concept art booklet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doki Doki Literature Club Fan Pack on Steam|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/717250|publisher=[[Valve Corporation]]|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvato cited his "love-hate relationship" with [[anime]] as inspiration for creating ''Doki Doki Literature Club!''. Discussing the horror elements of the game, Salvato explained that he was inspired by "things that are scary because they make you uncomfortable, not because they shove scary-looking things in your face."&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

'''Ethnogenesis''' (from [[Greek Language|Greek]] ''ethnos'' {{lang|grc|ἔθνος}}, "group of people, [[nation]]", and ''genesis'' {{lang|grc|γένεσις}}, "beginning, coming into being"; plural '''ethnogeneses''') is "the formation and development of an ethnic group."&lt;ref&gt;According to ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethnogenesis].&lt;/ref&gt; This can originate through a process of self-identification as well as come about as the result of outside identification.

The term is a mid-20th century neologism, refers to the observable phenomenon of emergence of new social groups that are identified as having a cohesive identity, i.e. an "ethnic group" in anthropological terms. Relevant sciences do not only observe this phenomenon but search for explanation of its causes. The term ''ethnogeny'' is also used as a variant of ''ethnogenesis''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/39846744/Ethnogesesis.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1527883691&amp;Signature=DnTxPmqi06w8%2BLfDbc2qeyg409E%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DEthnogenesis_A_Contested_Model_of_Early.pdf Andrew Gillett, "Ethnogenesis: A Contested Model of Early Medieval Europe", ''History Compass'' 4/2 (2006): 241–260 p. 244.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passive or active ethnogenesis==
Ethnogenesis can occur passively, in the accumulation of markers of group identity forged through interaction with the physical environment, cultural and religious divisions between sections of a society, migrations and other processes, for which ethnic subdivision is an unintended outcome. It can occur actively, as persons deliberately and directly 'engineer' separate identities to attempt to solve a political problem – the preservation or imposition of certain cultural values, power relations, etc.  Since the late eighteenth century, such attempts have often been related to [[language]] revival or creation of a new language, in what eventually becomes a "[[national literature]]".

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, societies challenged by the obsolescence of those [[narrative]]s which previously afforded them coherence have fallen back on ethnic or racial narratives as a means of maintaining or reaffirming their collective identity, or ''polis''.&lt;ref&gt;Geary, Patrick J. ''The Myth of Nations: The Medieval Origins of Europe.'' Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inclusive or exclusive nationalism ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

Ethnogenesis can be promoted to include or exclude any ethnic minority living within a certain country. In [[France]], the integrationalist policy of the [[French Republic]] was inclusive; their laws stated all persons born or legally residing in France proper (including overseas departments and territories) were "Frenchmen".  The law did not make any ethnic distinctions nor racial categories in between the "French" people. All people in France were Frenchmen and became citizens of the French Republic as far the country's law was concerned.

==Language revival==
Language has been a critical asset for authenticating ethnic identities.  The process of reviving an antique ethnic identity often poses an immediate language challenge, as obsolescent languages  lack expressions for contemporary experiences.  In Europe in the 1990s, examples of proponents of ethnic revivals were from [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] fringes in [[Wales]] and nationalists in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]].  Activists' attempts since the 1970s to revive the [[Occitan language]] in [[Southern France]] are a similar example.

Similarly, in the 19th century, the [[Fennoman]] [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] aimed to raise the [[Finnish language]] from peasant-status to the position of an official national language, which had been only [[Swedish language|Swedish]] for some time.  The Fennoman also founded the [[Finnish Party]] to pursue their nationalist aims. The publication in 1835 of the Finnish [[national epic]], ''[[Kalevala]]'', was a founding stone of Finnish nationalism and ethnogenesis.  Finnish was recognized as the [[official language]] of Finland only in 1892.  Fennomans were opposed by the [[Svecomans]], headed by [[Axel Olof Freudenthal]] (1836–1911).  He supported continuing the use of [[Swedish language|Swedish]] as the official language; it had been a minority language used by the educated elite in government and administration. In line with contemporary [[scientific racism]] theories, Freudenthal believed that Finland had two "[[race (historical definition)|races]]", one speaking Swedish and the other Finnish. The Svecomans claimed that the Swedish "Germanic race" was superior to the majority Finnish people. In [[Ireland]], revival of the [[Irish language]] was part of the reclaiming of [[Irish people|Irish]] identity in the republic.

Language has been an important and divisive political force in [[Belgium]] between the Dutch and Germanic [[Flemings]] and Franco-Celtic [[Walloons]] since the kingdom was created in 1831. [[Switzerland]] is divided among Alemannic [[ethnic German|German-speaking]] or ''[[Swiss German|Deutschschweizer]]'' against the [[French Swiss|French-speaking]] ''Romands'' or Arpitians, and the [[Italian language|Italian]]/[[Lombard language|Lombard]] and [[Romansch language|Romansh]]-speaking minorities in the south and east.

In [[Italy]], there were ethnological and linguistic differences between regional groups, from the [[Lombardy|Lombardians]] of the North to the [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilians]] of the south.  Mountainous terrain had allowed the development of relatively isolated communities and numerous dialects and languages before unification in the 19th century.

==Religion==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2007}}
The set of cultural markers that accompanies each of the major [[religion]]s may become a component of distinct ethnic identities, but they almost never exist in isolation.  Ethnic definitions are subject to change over time, both within and outside groups. For example, 19th-century Europeans classified Jews and Arabs as one 'ethnic' bloc, the [[Semitic people|Semites]] or [[Hamitic|Hamites]]. Later, the term Hamites came to be associated with [[Sub-Saharan African]]s instead.

Christian, Jewish, Hindu and Muslim followers have historically been aligned with ethnicities (and later nations) speaking different languages and having different cultures that arise on the basis of the languages that followers of each religion historically favoured:{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} ([[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Sanskrit Language|Sanskrit]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], respectively). The sources of religious differentiation are contested among [[sociology of religion|sociologists]] and among [[anthropology of religion|anthropologists]], as much as between the faith groups themselves.

The line between a well-defined religious [[sect]] and a discrete ethnicity cannot always be sharply defined. Sects that most observers would accept as constituting a separate ethnicity usually have, as a minimum, a firm set of rules related to maintenance of [[endogamy]], censuring those who 'marry out' or who fail to raise their children in the proper faith. Examples might include the [[Amish]], [[Druze]], [[Mormons]], [[Sikh]]s, [[Yazidi]] and [[Zoroastrians]]&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;[[#Harrison|Harrison]], p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Geographical factors can lead to both cultural and [[Genetics|genetic]] isolation from larger human societies.  Groups which settle remote habitats and intermarry over generations will acquire distinctive cultural and genetic traits, evolving from cultural continuity and through interaction with their unique environmental circumstances.  Ethnogenesis in these circumstances typically results in an identity that is less value-laden than one forged in contradistinction to competing populations.  Particularly in [[pastoral]] mountain peoples, social organization tends to hinge primarily on familial identification, not a wider [[collective identity]].

== Specific cases ==

===Ancient Greeks===
[[Anthony D. Smith]] notes that in general there is a lack of evidence which hampers the assessement of existence of nations or nationalisms in antiquity. The two cases where more evidence exists are those of ancient Greece and Israel. In Ancient Greece a cultural rather than political unity is observed. Yet, there were ethnic divisions within the wider Hellenic ethnic community, mainly the divisions between Ionians, Aeolians, Boeotians and Dorians. These groups were further divided into   city-states. Smith postulates that there is no more than a semblance of nationalism in ancient Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?hl=el&amp;lr=&amp;id=bEAJbHBlXR8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=ancient+greek+national+identity&amp;ots=fMkUNma1Fm&amp;sig=t3tg_wUoqqk70ONPdh13NuuwVZs&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Greece&amp;f=false Anthony D. Smith, National Identity, University of Nevada Press, 1991, pp  47, 48]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan M. Hall]]'s work “Ethnic Identity in Greek Antiquity” (1997), was acclaimed as the first full-length modern study on Ancient Greek ethnicity. According to Hall, Ancient Greek ethnic identity was much based on kinship, descent and genealogy, which was reflected in elaborate genealogy myths. On his view, genealogy is the most fundamental way any population defines itself as an ethnic group. There was a change in the way Greeks constructed their ethnic identity in the Persian Wars period (first half of  5th c BC). Before that (archaic period) Greeks tended to attach themselves to one another by a process of genealogical assimilation. After the Persian invasion, they tended to define themselves against the enemy they perceived as the barbarian “other”. An indication of this disposition is the Athenians' speech to their allies in 480 BC, mentioning that all Hellenes are bound with the ''homaimon'' (“same blood”), ''homoglosson'' (same language) and common religious practices. Hall believes that Hellenic identity was clearly envisaged in the 6th c. BC as being ethnic in character, cultural forms of identification emerged in the 5th century, and there is evidence that by the 4th century this identity was conceived more in cultural terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2004/2004-04-26.html Jonathan M.

=== Goths ===
Herwig Wolfram offers "a radically new explanation of the circumstances under which the [[Goths]] were settled in [[Gaul]], [[Hispania|Spain]] and [[Italy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Thomas J. Dunlap, tr.''History of the Goths'' (1979, 1988) Preface, p. x&lt;/ref&gt; Since "they dissolved at their downfall into a myth accessible to everyone" at the head of a long history of attempts to lay claim to a "Gothic" tradition, the ethnogenesis by which disparate bands came to self-identify as "Goths" is of wide interest and application. The problem is in extracting a [[ethnohistory|historical ethnography]] from sources that are resolutely Latin and Roman-oriented.

=== American Indian North American Southwest ===
With the arrival of the Spanish in southwestern North America, the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Jumano]] cultural sphere underwent social changes partly in reaction, which spurred their ethnogenesis, Clayton Anderson has observed.&lt;ref&gt;See Clayton Anderson, ''The Indian Southwest, 1580-1830: Ethnogenesis and Reinvention'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press) 1999; a broader scope is included in the articles in  Jonathan D. Hill (ed.), ''History, Power, and Identity: Ethnogenesis in the Americas, 1492-1992'', (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnogenesis in the [[Texas Plains]] and along the coast took two forms: a disadvantaged group identified with a stronger group and became absorbed into it, on the one hand, and on the other hand, cultural institutions were modified and in a sense reinvented. The 17th-century Jumano disintegration, a collapse in part by the widespread deaths from introduced diseases, was followed by their reintegration as [[Kiowa]], Nancy Hickerson has argued.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Parrott Hickerson, ''The Jumanos: Hunters and Traders of the South Plains'' (University of Texas Press) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exterior stresses that produced ethnogenetic shifts preceded the arrival of the Spanish and their horse culture: recurring cycles of drought had previously forced non-kin to band together or to disband and mobilize. Intertribal hostilities forced weaker groups to associate with stronger ones.

=== Southeastern North American Indians===
From 1539 to 1543, a Spanish expedition led by [[Hernando de Soto]] departed [[Cuba]] for [[Florida]] and the [[American Southeast]].  Although asked to practice restraint, Soto led 600 men on a violent rampage through present-day Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and East Texas. Frustrated with not finding gold or silver in the areas suspected to contain such valuable materials, they destroyed villages and decimated native populations. Despite his death in 1542, Soto's men continued their expedition until 1543 when about half of their original force reached Mexico. Their actions introduced European diseases that further weakened native populations.  The population collapse forced natives to relocate from their cities into the countryside, where smaller villages and new political structures developed, replacing the older chiefdom models of tribal governance. By 1700, the major tribal settlements Soto and his men had encountered were no more.  Smaller tribes began to form loose confederations of smaller, more autonomous villages. From that blending of many tribes, ethnogenesis led to the emergence of new ethnic groups and identities for the consolidated natives who had managed to survive the invasion of European people, animals, and diseases.  After 1700, most North American Indian "tribes" were relatively new composite groups formed by these refugees who were trying to cope with massive epidemics and violence brought by the Europeans who were exploring the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Alan|title=American Colonies:  The Settling of North America|date=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-200210-0|pages=72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North American Aboriginals in the Canadian West ===
The bringing of disease by the Europeans redistributed the indigenous communities and this caused a lot of war, disagreements (since they were going into each other's land and sacred areas), and a rise in mortality rates. Some Aboriginal groups were destroyed while some began to band together and create new Aboriginal groups within these areas of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/840250989|title=Clearing the Plains : disease, politics of starvation, and the loss of Aboriginal life|last=1961-|first=Daschuk, James W.

=== Creation of Moldovan identity ===
The separate [[Moldovans|Moldovan]] ethnic identification was promoted under Soviet rule when the Soviet Union set up an autonomous [[Moldavian ASSR|Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1924. It was set apart from the [[Ukrainian SSR]] on part of the territory between the [[Dniester]] and [[Southern Bug]] rivers ([[Transnistria]]). The scholar Charles King concluded&lt;ref&gt;Charles King, ''The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture'', Hoover Institution Press, 2000:54.&lt;/ref&gt; that this action was in part a prop to Soviet propaganda and help for a potential communist revolution in Romania. At first, a Moldovan ethnicity supported territorial claims to the then-Romanian territories of [[Bessarabia]] and [[Northern Bukovina]]. The claims were based on the fact that the territory of eastern Bessarabia with Chisinau had belonged to the Russian Empire between 1812 and 1918. After having been for 500 years part of the Romanian Principality of Moldova, Russia was awarded the East of Moldova as a recompensation for its losses during the Napoleonic Wars: that was the beginning of the 100 years Russian history in East Moldova. After the [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum|Soviet occupation of the two territories in 1940]], potential reunification claims were offset by the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. At the establishment of the Moldaivan ASSR, Chișinău was named its capital, a role which it continued to play after the formation of the [[Moldavian SSR]] in 1940.

The recognition of [[Moldovans]] as a separate ethnicity, distinct from [[Romanians]], remains today a controversial subject. On one side, the Moldovan Parliament adopted in 2003 "The Concept on National Policy of the Republic of Moldova", which states that Moldovans and Romanians are two distinct peoples and speak two different languages, Romanians form an ethnic minority in Moldova, and the Republic of Moldova is the legitimate successor to the Principality of Moldavia. However, Moldovans are recognized as a distinct ethnic group only by former Soviet states.

Moreover, in Romania, people from Wallachia and Transylvania call the Romanians inhabiting western Moldavia, now part of Romania, as Moldovans. People in Romanian Moldova call themselves Moldovans, as subethnic denomination, and Romanians, as ethnic denomination (like Kentish and English for English people living in Kent). Romanians from Romania call the Romanians of the Republic of Moldova Bessarabians, as identification inside the subethnic group, Moldovans as subethnic group and Romanians as ethnic group. The subethnic groups referred to here are historically connected to independent Principalities. The Principality of Moldavia/Moldova founded in 1349 had various extensions between 1349 and 1859 and comprised Bucovina and Bessarabia as regional subdivisions. That way, Romanians of southern Bukovina (today part of Romania and formerly part of the historical Moldova) are called Bukovinans, Moldovans and Romanians.

In the [[2004 Moldovan Census]], of the 3,383,332 people living in Moldova, 16.5% (558,508) chose Romanian as their mother tongue, and 60% chose Moldovan. While 40% of all [[urban area|urban]] Romanian/Moldovan speakers indicated Romanian as their mother tongue, in the countryside, barely one out of seven Romanian/Moldovan speakers indicated Romanian as his mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;National Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova: [http://www.statistica.md/recensamint.php?lang=ro Census 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311020813/http://www.statistica.md/recensamint.php?lang=ro |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical scholarship==
Within the historical profession, the term "ethnogenesis" has been borrowed as a [[neologism]] to explain the origins and evolution of so-called [[barbarian]] ethnic cultures,&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Pohl]]. "Aux origines d'une Europe ethnique. Transformations d'identites entre Antiquite et Moyen Age". ''Annales HSS'' 60 (2005): 183-208, and Pohl, "Conceptions of Ethnicity in Early Medieval Studies" ''Debating the Middle Ages: Issues and Readings'', ed. Lester K. Little and Barbara H. Rosenwein, (Blackwell), 1998, pp 13-24.([http://www.kroraina.com/bulgar/pohl_etnicity.html  On-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt; stripped of its metaphoric connotations drawn from biology, of "natural" birth and growth. That view is closely associated with the Austrian historian [[Herwig Wolfram]] and his followers, who argued that such ethnicity was not a matter of genuine genetic descent ("tribes").

Rather, using Reinhard Wenskus' term ''Traditionskerne'' ("nuclei of tradition"),&lt;ref&gt;Wenskus' comparative study of German ethnogeneses is ''Stammesbildung und Verfassung'' (Cologne and Graz) 1961&lt;/ref&gt; ethnogenesis arose from small groups of aristocratic warriors carrying ethnic traditions from place to place and generation to generation. Followers would coalesce or disband around these nuclei of tradition; ethnicities were available to those who wanted to participate in them with no requirement of being born into a "tribe". Thus, questions of race and place of origin became secondary.

Proponents of ethnogenesis may claim it is the only alternative to the sort of [[ethnocentric]] and [[historiography and nationalism|nationalist scholarship]] that is commonly seen in disputes over the origins of many ancient peoples such as the [[Franks]], [[Goths]], and [[Huns]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kulikowski]] (2006). ''Rome's Gothic Wars''. Cambridge University Press. Page 53&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been used as an alternative to the Near East's "race history" that had supported [[Phoenicianism]] and claims to the antiquity of the variously called [[Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac people]]s.

'''''f*INK Weekly Entertainment Guide ''''' was a free weekly guide owned by [[Martin Kean]] and [[Caroline McCaw]]. It was published each Wednesday from February to December, from 1996-2009 in [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]]. The aim of the guide was to provide free information about events to the local community using cheap one-colour printing but with a distinctive design style. Part of f*INK's mission was support of and collaboration with artist networks, bands and musicians, including those that grew out of the [[Dunedin sound]].

== History ==
In June 1996, [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]], [[Caroline McCaw]] and [[Martin Kean]] together with [[Allan Thommason]] (aka [[OziBsy]]) published the first issue of f*INK, in response to a lack of entertainment listings for band events and dance parties in the usual media outlets such as the [[Otago Daily Times]]. f*INK was the first of many A6-sized free paper gig guides in New Zealand, and has outlasted many similar guides.

f*INK's reputation as a consistent source of entertainment information meant that it was popular for more than twelve years. f*INK has also published articles during its history that document the growth of alternative communities in Dunedin and Otago. f*INK has published free comics in every issue of f*INK, notably work by [[Indira Neville]], and 'City of Tales' by Stefan Neville and [[Futurians (band)|Clayton Noone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hicksville.co.nz/Pavement%20Oct%20Nov%2099.htm ''Pavement Magazine'' Oct-Nov 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, f*INK published Dunedin maps and Arts &amp; Fashion maps that won support from the Dunedin City Council Visitor Centre. Kevin Thompson, the Visitor Centre manager in 1999 described the A3-sized fold-up maps as "a very good working tool for us."&lt;ref&gt;[[Evening Star (Dunedin)|THE STAR]], Sunday June 20, 1999, pp20.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition of ten years of f*INK issues was hosted by Dunedin Public Libraries in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dunedinpubliclibraries.wordpress.com/2007/06/15/fink-exhibition/ Dunedin Public Libraries]&lt;/ref&gt;

f*INK was recommended by two travel books/guides: [[Lonely Planet]] and [[Rough Guides]]. In the 2002 edition [[Lonely Planet]] New Zealand writes, "'''Entertainment''': The [[Otago Daily Times]] newspaper lists what's on around the city, but the best publication is the free f*INK, available around town or online at www.fink.net.nz." &lt;ref&gt;''Lonely Planet New Zealand''. Harding, P., Bain, C., Bedford, N. 11th Edition. Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd, Sydney, 2002. p591.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rough Guide to New Zealand'' of 2002 states, "For the latest on the Dunedin Sound, check out f*INK the free entertainment pamphlet available all around town, including the visitor centre (or see www.fink.net.nz), which keeps track of Dunedin's bands, singers and songwriters." &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aiIrweIMckQC&amp;pg=PA743&amp;lpg=PA743&amp;dq=fINK+dunedin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Pgbekihc-U&amp;sig=IH85LBleXCR_EZPiuN8aFBxLWzA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XhnESdH8B5GYsAPjhdVQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result ''The Rough Guide to New Zealand'' 2002]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication was sold in 2008 to Carmen Norgate, resurrecting the entertainment guide as 'INK, which was published weekly until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odt.co.nz/entertainment/arts/171274/festival-fanzines-zinefest Otago Daily Times, "A festival of fanzines Zinefest", By Shane Gilchrist, published on Sat, 30 Jul 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the [[ecumenical]] (i.e., universally celebrated) feasts of Christian churches, ranking with the feasts of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], of [[Easter]], and [[Pentecost]]. Ascension Day is traditionally celebrated on a Thursday, the fortieth day of [[Easter]] (following the accounts given in {{bibleverse||Mark|16:19|NLT}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|24:51|NLT}} and 
{{bibleverse||Acts|1:2|NLT}}), although some Christian denominations have moved the observance to the following Sunday.

==History==
The observance of this feast is of great antiquity. [[Eusebius]] seems to hint at the celebration of it in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Life of Constantine'' IV.54&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 5th century, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] says that it is of [[Apostolic Fathers|Apostolic]] origin, and he speaks of it in a way that shows it was the universal observance of the Church long before his time. Frequent mention of it is made in the writings of [[John Chrysostom|St. John Chrysostom]], [[Gregory of Nyssa|St. Gregory of Nyssa]], and in the ''[[Apostolic Constitution|Constitution of the Apostles]]''. The ''[[Egeria (pilgrim)|Pilgrimage of Aetheria]]'' speaks of the vigil of this feast and of the feast itself, as they were kept in the church built over the grotto in [[Bethlehem]] in which Christ is traditionally regarded as having been born.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Duchesne]], ''Christian Worship: Its Origin and Evolution'' (London, 1903), 491–515.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that prior to the 5th century the event narrated in the Gospels was commemorated in conjunction with the feast of Easter or Pentecost. Some believe that the much-disputed forty-third decree of the [[Synod of Elvira]] (c. 300) condemning the practice of observing a feast on the fortieth day after Easter and neglecting to keep Pentecost on the fiftieth day, implies that the proper usage of the time was to commemorate the Ascension along with Pentecost. Representations of the [[Sacred mysteries#Christian mysteries|mystery]] are found in [[diptych]]s and [[fresco]]es dating as early as the 5th century.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Western==
The Latin terms used for the feast, ''ascensio'' and, occasionally, ''ascensa'', signify that Christ was raised up by his own powers, and it is from these terms that the holy day gets its name. In the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Anglican Communion]], "Holy Thursday" is listed as another name for Ascension Day.&lt;ref name="Forster"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soane"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofengland.org/media/877842/5-table-vigils-fasts.pdf Church of England, "A Table of the Vigils, Fasts and Days of Abstinence to be observed in the year"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Blake]]'s poem "[[Holy Thursday (Songs of Innocence)|Holy Thursday]]" refers to Ascension Day; Thomas Pruen used the term to refer to Ascension Day in his ''Illustration of the Liturgy of the Church of England'', published in 1820;&lt;ref name="Pruen1820"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pruen |first=Thomas |title=An Illustration of the Liturgy of the Church of England|accessdate=11 May 2014|year=1820|publisher=W. Bulmer and W. Nicol|language=English |page=173 |quote=Ascension Day.

In [[Western Christianity]], the earliest possible date is April 30 (as in 1818 and 2285), the latest possible date is June 3 (as in 1943 and 2038). In [[Roman Catholicism]], the Ascension of the Lord is a [[Holy Day of Obligation]] and in the [[Anglican Communion]], Holy Thursday is a [[Principal Feast]].

The three days before Ascension Thursday are sometimes referred to as the [[Rogation days]], and the previous Sunday &amp;mdash; the Sixth Sunday of Easter (or the Fifth Sunday ''after'' Easter) &amp;mdash; as [[Rogation Sunday]].

Ascension has a [[vigil]] and, since the 15th century, an [[octave (liturgical)|octave]], which is set apart for a [[novena]] of preparation for Pentecost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules to Order the Christian Year |publisher=[[Church of England]] |year=2015 |url= https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/common-worship-rules/rulesyear.aspx |accessdate=14 May 2015 |quote=Rogation Days are the three days before Ascension Day, when prayer is offered for God's blessing on the fruits of the earth and on human labour.

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] in a number of countries that do not observe the feast as a public holiday has obtained permission from the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to move observance of the Feast of the Ascension from the traditional Thursday to the following Sunday, the Sunday before Pentecost. Similarly, [[The United Methodist Church]] allows the traditional celebration on Holy Thursday to be moved to Sunday.&lt;ref name="Hickman2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hickman|first=Hoyt L.|title=United Methodist Altars|date=1 July 2011|publisher=Abingdon Press|language=English |isbn=9781426730696|page=52}}&lt;!--|accessdate=14 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is in keeping with a trend to move [[Holy Day of Obligation|Holy Days of Obligation]] from weekdays to Sunday, to encourage more Christians to observe feasts considered important.&lt;ref name="stcloud"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sun" &gt;On the following Sunday in some areas: see [[#Sunday observance|Sunday observance]]&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to move a feast is made by the bishops of an [[ecclesiastical province]], i.e. an [[archbishop]] and the neighbouring bishops.

Richert, About.com&lt;/ref&gt; When celebrated on Sunday, the earliest possible date is May 3, and the latest is June 6.

==Eastern and Oriental Orthodox==
In the [[Eastern Church]] this feast is known in Greek as ''Analepsis'', the "taking up", and also as the ''Episozomene'', the "salvation from on high", denoting that by ascending into his glory Christ completed the work of our [[redemption (theology)|redemption]]. Ascension is one of the Twelve [[Great Feasts]] of the Orthodox [[liturgical year]].

[[File:Ascension2007-04.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Liturgy during the Feast of the Ascension in a Mumbai [[Syriac Orthodox Church in India|Syrian Orthodox Church]]]]
===Celebration===
The feast is always observed with an [[All-night vigil]]. The day before is the [[Afterfeast|Apodosis]] (leave-taking) of Easter (i.e., the last day of the Feast of Easter). Before the Vigil, the [[Paschal hours]] are said for the last time and the [[Paschal greeting]] is exchanged.

The ''Paroemia'' ([[Old Testament]] readings) at [[Vespers]] on the eve of the Feast are {{bibleverse||Isaiah|2:2–3|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Isaiah|62:10–63:3|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|63:7–9|KJV}}; and {{bibleverse||Zechariah|14:1–4|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Zechariah|14:8–11|KJV}}. A [[Lity (Orthodox Vespers)|Lity]] is celebrated. The [[troparion]] of the day is sung, which says:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
O Christ God, You have ascended in Glory,
Granting joy to Your disciples by the promise of the Holy Spirit.
Through the blessing they were assured
That You are the Son of God,
The Redeemer of the world!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

During the [[Polyeleos]] at [[Matins]], the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaphios]], which was placed on the altar on [[Holy Saturday]] (either at Matins or the [[Midnight Office]], depending on local custom) is taken from the altar and carried in procession around the church. It is then put in the place reserved for it. The Gospel is {{bibleverse||Mark|16:9–20|KJV}}. The kontakion is sung, which announces:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
When You did fulfill the dispensation for our sake,
And unite earth to Heaven:
You did ascend in glory, O Christ our God,
Not being parted from those who love You,
But remaining with them and crying:
I am with you and no one will be against you.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The [[megalynarion]] and [[irmos]] from Ode IX of the Canon (also sung at liturgy) is:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Magnify, O my soul, Christ the Giver of Life,
Who has ascended from earth to heaven!
We magnify you, the Mother of God,
Who beyond reason and understanding
gave birth in time to the Timeless One.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

At the [[Divine Liturgy]], special antiphons are sung in place of Psalms 102 and 145 and the Beatitudes. The [[Epistle]] is {{bibleverse||Acts|1:1–12|KJV}}, and the [[Gospel]] is {{bibleverse||Luke|24:36–53|KJV}}.

===Observance===
Ascension Thursday also commemorates the Holy [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian]] [[Martyr]]s of Persia (17th–18th centuries).

Ascension has an [[Afterfeast]] of eight days. The Sunday after Ascension is the Sunday of the [[Church fathers|Holy Fathers]] of the [[First Ecumenical Council]] at [[Nicaea]]. This council formulated the [[Nicene Creed]] up to the words, "He (Jesus) ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father; and shall come again, with glory, to judge the living and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end." The Afterfeast ends on the following Friday, the Friday before Pentecost. The next day is appropriately a [[All Souls Day|Saturday of the Dead]] (general commemoration of all faithful departed).

The Eastern Orthodox Church uses a different method of [[computus|calculating]] the [[date of Easter]], so the Eastern Orthodox commemoration of Ascension will usually be after the western observance (either one week, or four weeks, or five weeks later; but occasionally on the same day). The earliest possible date for the feast is May 13 (of the western calendar), and the latest possible date is June 16. Some of the Oriental Orthodox Churches, however, observe Ascension on the same date as the Western Churches.&lt;ref&gt;"The Church in Malankara switched entirely to the Gregorian calendar in 1953, following Encyclical No. 620 from Patriarch Mor Ignatius Aphrem I, dt. December 1952." [http://sor.cua.edu/Calendar/index.html Calendars of the Syriac Orthodox Church]. Retrieved 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain customs or rituals were connected with the liturgy of this feast, such as the blessing of beans and grapes after the Commemoration of the Dead in the Canon of the Mass, the blessing of [[first fruits]], afterwards done on [[Rogation Days]], the blessing of a candle, the wearing of mitres by [[deacon]] and [[subdeacon]], the extinguishing of the [[paschal candle]], and triumphal processions with torches and banners outside the churches to commemorate the entry of Christ into heaven.

The antiquarian [[Daniel Rock]] records the English custom of carrying at the head of the procession the banner bearing the device of the lion and at the foot the banner of the dragon, to symbolize the triumph of Christ in his ascension over the evil one (and can also be interpreted by analogy as the triumph of [[England]] over [[Wales]]). In some churches the scene of the Ascension was vividly reproduced by elevating the figure of Christ above the altar through an opening in the roof of the church. In others, whilst the figure of Christ was made to ascend, that of the [[devil]] was made to descend.

In England it was once common for churches to "[[beating the bounds|beat the bounds]]" on this day, and some continue the custom (e.g. the church of [[St Michael at the North Gate]] in [[Oxford]]). Members of the parish walk round the parish boundaries, marking boundary stones (e.g. by writing on them in chalk) and hitting them with sticks. According to some, it was once the young boys of the parish that were hit with sticks instead of the stones. Knowledge of the parish boundaries was once important, since churches had certain duties such as the care of children born out of wedlock in the parish.

In some countries ({{cn span|at least in [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Colombia]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]] (since the 1930s), [[Haiti]], [[Iceland]], [[Indonesia]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Madagascar]], [[Namibia]], The [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Swaziland]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Vanuatu]]|date=May 2018}}) it is a public holiday; Germany also holds its [[Fathers' Day]] on the same date.

Coinciding with the liturgical feast is the annual commemoration by the Christian labour movement (especially [[syndic]]al, in Belgium) of the [[encyclical]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' issued by the Roman Catholic [[Pope Leo XIII]] on May 15, 1891.

In [[Venice]] the ceremony of the [[Marriage of the Sea ceremony|Wedding with the Sea]] was traditionally celebrated on the Feast of the Ascension, while in [[Florence]] the Feast was observed by having a dove slide down a string from the high altar of the cathedral to ignite a large decorative container filled with fireworks in front of the main entrance of the cathedral.

In Portugal on "Wheatstalk Thursday", small bundles of poppies and wheatstalks are picked in the fields and placed at home until next year, for good fortune.

==Music==
The [[Church cantata#Ascension|feast has been associated]] with specific hymns and other church music. The oldest hymn in German related to the feast is the [[Leise]] "[[Christ fuhr gen Himmel]]", first published in 1480. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] composed several [[Bach cantata|cantata]]s and the ''[[Ascension Oratorio]]'' to be performed in church services on the feast day. He first performed ''[[Wer da gläubet und getauft wird, BWV 37]]'', on 18 May 1724, ''[[Auf Christi Himmelfahrt allein, BWV 128]]'', on 10 May 1725, ''[[Gott fähret auf mit Jauchzen, BWV 43]]'', on 30 May 1726 and the oratorio, ''[[Lobet Gott in seinen Reichen, BWV 11]]'', on 19 May 1735.

The '''''Fragmentary Annals of Ireland''''' or '''''Three Fragments''''' are a [[Middle Irish language|Middle Irish]] combination of chronicles from various [[Irish annals]] and narrative history. They were compiled in the [[kingdom of Osraige]], probably in the lifetime of [[Donnchad mac Gilla Pátraic]] (died 1039), [[king of Osraige]] and of [[king of Leinster]]. A major narrative within the text is the so-called "[[Osraige Chronicle]]" (as proposed by Radner) which greatly focuses on the exploits of the ninth century king of Osraige, [[Cerball mac Dúnlainge]], who was the paternal ancestor of the medieval [[Mac Giolla Phádraig]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Radner, pg. xxii&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Fragmentary Annals'' were copied in 1643 for the Rev. John Lynch by [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]] from a lost 15th-century vellum manuscript, which belonged to [[Giolla na Naomh Mac Aodhagáin]] (Nehemias MacEgan). Mac Aodhagáin, who died around 1443, was a professor of Irish [[Brehon Law]] in [[Earl of Ormond (Irish)|Ormond]]. The sole surviving manuscript of the ''Fragmentary Annals'', which is currently held by the [[Royal Library of Belgium]] in [[Brussels]], is not in Mac Fhirbhisigh's hand, but in that of an anonymous scribe, who made a fair copy of Mac Fhirbhisigh's text, adding some marginal comments of his own and an index. The manuscript (MS. 7, c. n. 17) is incomplete and includes five fragments of annals beginning in 573 and ending in 914. What has survived joins the synopsis of the hypothetical [[Chronicle of Ireland]].

Little is known of the lost exemplar from which Mac Fhirbhisigh worked. He appears to have modernized the orthography of the original text as he copied it. There are lacunae in places where the exemplar could no longer be read due to its poor condition. Mac Fhirbhisigh's copyist added dates, which he took from the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'' without troubling to confirm their accuracy or correct them where they were clearly in error.

The first fragment relates mainly to the [[Uí Néill|Northern Uí Néill]] and may have been compiled in Ulster, but the remaining fragments were evidently compiled in Osraige (Ossory), a kingdom which corresponded approximately to the later County Kilkenny and western County Laois. The original compiler evidently drew upon a variety of sources, some of which (e.g. annals) were probably more accurate and trustworthy than others (e.g. long bardic works). The fragments combine cold annalistic records with romantic tales and extravagant flights of fancy in a manner that is unique among the Irish annals.

Two modern editions of the ''Fragmentary Annals'' have been published:
* [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] (editor &amp; translator) ''Annals of Ireland: three fragments.'' (Dublin 1860)
* [[Joan N. Radner]] (editor &amp; translator) ''Fragmentary annals of Ireland'' (Dublin 1978)

The '''Galerie d'Apollon''' is a part of the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]], famous for its high vaulted ceilings with painted decorations.

The room was originally called the 'Petite Galerie' of the Louvre and was decorated by the artists of the Second [[School of Fontainebleau]], most notably [[Toussaint Dubreuil]], [[Jacob Bunel]] and his wife Marguerite Bahuche according to designs by [[Martin Fréminet]], for [[Henri IV of France]].

After a fire in the small gallery destroyed much of it on 6 February 1661, it was necessary to rebuild this part of the Louvre.&lt;ref name=MH&gt;[http://monumentshistoriques.free.fr/chateaux/le%20louvre/chronologie.html History of the Louvre] on [[Monument Historique]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural work was entrusted to [[Louis Le Vau]], who carried out reconstruction activities between 1661 and 1663, while [[Charles Le Brun]] was assigned responsibility for decorations by Colbert.&lt;ref name=MH/&gt; The sculptor [[François Girardon]] was responsible for the stucco sculptures. This was the first Royal Gallery for [[Louis XIV]], which served as a model for the [[Hall of Mirrors]] of the [[Palace of Versailles]]. 

==Brief Timeline==
[[File:Apollo Gallery, Louvre.JPG|thumb|Decorated ceiling of the Apollo Gallery]]
* Fire in 1661: Start of reconstruction in 1661 on the orders of the young Louis XIV&lt;ref name=MH/&gt;
* 1663-1677: Implementation of interior decoration. 
* 1692: The academy of painting and sculpture was installed at the Louvre, which encouraged young artists to finish the room with "reception" or "masterpieces"
* 1766-1781: the gallery was completed under the supervision of six academics.
* 1848-1851: Restoration work by [[Félix Duban]], painting the race of Apollo by [[Eugène Delacroix]], Muller ( Aurore ) and Guichard ( Triumph of the Earth or Cybele ).&lt;ref name=MH/&gt;
* 1999-2004: the French restoration service of historical monuments carried out restoration activities.


The thirteen-year-old [[Henry James]] wrote of the Gallery "the wondrous Galerie d'Apollon...drawn out for me as a long but assured initiation and seeming to form, with its supreme coved ceiling and inordinately shining parquet, a prodigious tube or tunnel through which I inhaled little by little, that is again and again, a general sense of ''glory''. The glory meant ever so many things at once, not only beauty and art and supreme design, but history and fame and power, the world in fine raised to the richest and noblest expression."&lt;ref&gt;Memory recorded in Henry James' autobiography "[[A Small Boy and Others]]" which he wrote at age seventy in 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Louvre, the Apollo gallery is both a national and [[world heritage site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=PA00085992 PA00085992] in the French database for national heritage&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glenesk Folk Museum''' is a museum located in the [[Glen Esk]] valley, in [[Tarfside]], [[Angus, Scotland]], which is run by members of the local community.&lt;ref name="HumphreysReid2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rob Humphreys|author2=Donald Reid|title=The Rough Guide to Scottish Highlands &amp; Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DvJgUpClmCkC&amp;pg=PT324|accessdate=28 February 2012|date=2 May 2011|publisher=Rough Guides Ltd|isbn=978-1-4053-8940-2|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is about {{convert|9|mi|km}} north of the village of [[Edzell]].

It also has a shop selling locally produced gifts and a tearoom. The museum organises demonstrations of local skills and crafts.

==History==
The Museum was established in 1955 by Greta Michie, a local schoolteacher&lt;ref name=ToDo&gt;{{cite web |title=Things to do |url=http://www.gleneskretreat.co.uk/#/things-to-do/4546628989 |publisher=Glenesk Retreat and Folk Museum |accessdate=28 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65n42CydX?url=http://www.gleneskretreat.co.uk/ |archivedate=28 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was inspired by folk museums in Scandinavia. The building used for the museum, known as 'the Retreat', had been constructed as a retirement cottage in the 1840s by Captain J.E. Wemyss.&lt;ref name=AngusGlens&gt;{{cite web|title=Glenesk Museum|url=http://www.angusglens.co.uk/esk/glenesk_museum.php|work=AngusGlens|publisher=Angus Council|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQ |url=http://www.gleneskretreat.co.uk/#/faq/4548065370 |publisher=Glenesk Retreat and Folk Museum |accessdate=28 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65n4Ea4Ei?url=http://www.gleneskretreat.co.uk/ |archivedate=28 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later expanded and used as a [[shooting lodge]], and later a [[summer house]] by the earls of Dalhousie, before falling into disuse. Lord and Lady Dalhousie assisted with the establishment of the museum on this site.&lt;ref name=AngusGlens/&gt;

The museum was refurbished and expanded in 2007.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

==Collections==
The museum's artefacts are arranged thematically into rooms, including spaces covering music and costume. There are reconstructions of rooms from the 1850s, including a children's room.&lt;ref name=Leaflet1&gt;{{cite web |title=The Retreat Glenesk |url=http://btckstorage.blob.core.windows.net/site2160/63954%20A4%20Tri%20fold21.pdf |publisher=The Glenesk Trust |accessdate=28 February 2012 |format=Leaflet |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65n4hMWGm?url=http://btckstorage.blob.core.windows.net/site2160/63954%20A4%20Tri%20fold21.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum also has a document archive for genealogical research, including Census records from 1841 to 1891 and a partial record of births, marriages and deaths in the Glen and the parishes of [[Edzell]] and [[Lethnot]].&lt;ref name=AngusGlens/&gt; This room has computers.&lt;ref name=Leaflet1/&gt;

The museum has a small collection of musical instruments, highlights of which include a trapezoidal Savart-style violin that was played for many years on the streets of Aberdeen by an itinerant musician, and a coach horn known to have been used locally as late as the 1930s on one of the last horse-drawn stagecoaches operating in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glenesk Retreat and Folk Museum|url=http://www.minim-uk.org/places/glenesk/glenesk-retreat-and-folk-museum/|website=MINIM-UK|publisher=[[Higher Education Funding Council for England]]|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities and events==
Since its foundation, the Retreat has sold locally produced goods, and this continues in the gift shop. There is also a [[tearoom]] with home-cooked food.&lt;ref name=AngusGlens/&gt;

The Retreat also has conference facilities, a function room, a nature trail and a children's play area.

Regular craft workshops are run on-site, along with other events which have included music recitals and storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Events |url=http://www.gleneskretreat.co.uk/#/events/4547718559 |publisher=Glenesk Retreat and Folk Museum |accessdate=28 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65n3r8V3e?url=http://www.gleneskretreat.co.uk/ |archivedate=28 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Osmar Schindler David und Goliath.jpg|thumb|''David and Goliath'', a colour lithograph by [[Osmar Schindler]] (c. 1888)]]
'''Goliath'''{{efn|({{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|ˈ|l|aɪ|ə|θ}}; {{lang-he-n|גָּלְיָת}}, ''{{transl|he|Golyat}}'') {{lang-ar|جالوت}} ''{{transl|ar|Ǧulyāt}}'' &lt;small&gt;(Christian term)&lt;/small&gt;, ''{{transl|ar|Ǧālūt}}'' &lt;small&gt;(Quranic term)&lt;/small&gt;)}} is described in the biblical [[Book of Samuel]] as a [[Philistines|Philistine]] giant defeated by the young [[David]] in [[single combat]]. The story signified [[Saul]]'s unfitness to rule, as Saul himself should have fought for the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]].{{sfn|Nelson|2000|p=519}}

The phrase "[[Goliath#Modern usage of "David and Goliath"|David and Goliath]]" (or "David versus Goliath") has taken on a more popular meaning, denoting an [[Underdog (term)|underdog]] situation, a contest where a smaller, weaker opponent faces a much bigger, stronger adversary.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/david-and-goliath | title=David and Goliath | encyclopedia=Oxford Advanced American Dictionary | accessdate=11 February 2015}} "used to describe a situation in which a small or weak person or organization tries to defeat another much larger or stronger opponent: ''The game looks like it will be a David and Goliath contest.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical account==
[[File:071A.David Slays Goliath.jpg|thumbnail|David hoists the severed head of Goliath as illustrated by [[Gustave Doré]] (1866).]]

===The Goliath narrative in 1 Samuel 17===
[[Saul]] and the [[Israelites]] are facing the [[Philistines]] in the [[Valley of Elah]]. Twice a day for 40 days, morning and evening, Goliath, the [[champion]] of the Philistines, comes out between the lines and challenges the Israelites to send out a champion of their own to decide the outcome in [[Single combat#Single combat|single combat]], but Saul is afraid. [[David]], bringing food for his elder brothers, hears that Goliath has defied the armies of God and of the reward from Saul to the one that defeats him, and accepts the challenge. Saul reluctantly agrees and offers his armor, which David declines, taking only his staff, sling and five stones from a brook.

David and Goliath confront each other, Goliath with his armor and javelin, David with his staff and sling. "The Philistine cursed David by his gods", but David replies: "This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly may know that God saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is God's, and he will give you into our hand."

David hurls a stone from his sling and hits Goliath in the center of his forehead, Goliath falls on his face to the ground, and David cuts off his head. The Philistines flee and are pursued by the Israelites "as far as [[Gath (city)|Gath]] and the gates of [[Ekron]]". David puts the armor of Goliath in his own tent and takes the head to [[Jerusalem]], and Saul sends [[Abner]] to bring the boy to him. The king asks whose son he is, and David answers, "I am the son of your servant [[Jesse]] the [[Bethlehem]]ite."

===Composition of the Book of Samuel and the Goliath narrative===
The [[Books of Samuel]], together with the books of [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]], make up a unified history of Israel which biblical scholars call the [[Deuteronomistic history]]. The first edition of the history was probably written at the court of Judah's King [[Josiah]] (late 7th century) and a revised second edition during the exile (6th century), with further revisions in the post-exilic period.{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=2 and fn6}}{{sfn|Person|2010|p=10–11}} Traces of this can be seen in the contradictions and illogicalities of the Goliath story - to take a few examples, David turns from Saul's adult shield-bearer into a child herding sheep for his father, Saul finds it necessary to send for him when as the king's shield-bearer he should already be beside his royal master, and then has to ask who David is, which sits strangely with David's status at his court.{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=262 fn62}} The Goliath story is made up of base-narrative with numerous additions made probably after the exile:{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=259-260 fn58}} 
:''Original story''
*The Israelites and Philistines face each other; Goliath makes his challenge to single combat;
*David volunteers to fight Goliath;
*David defeats Goliath, the Philistines flee the battlefield.
:''Additions''
*David is sent by his father to bring food to his brothers, hears the challenge, and expresses his desire to accept; 
*Details of the account of the battle;

==Textual considerations==

=== Goliath's height ===
[[File:David and Goliath.jpg|thumb|''Goliath laughs at David'', 1915, by [[Ilya Repin]]]]
[[File:Andrea Vaccaro - David with the Head of Goliath.jpg|thumb|''David with the Head of Goliath'', circa 1635, by [[Andrea Vaccaro]]]]

Goliath's stature as described in various ancient manuscripts varies: the oldest manuscripts, the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] text of Samuel, the 1st-century historian [[Josephus]], and the 4th-century Septuagint manuscripts, all give his height as "four [[cubit]]s and a [[Span (unit)|span]]" ({{convert|6|ft|9|in|disp=or}}), whereas the [[Masoretic Text]] gives this as "six cubits and a span" ({{convert|9|ft|9|in|disp=or}}).&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, C. S. (1992). "Goliath (Person)". In D. N. Freedman (ed.), ''The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary'' (Vol. 2, p. 1073). New York: Doubleday&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars generally agree that the shorter height found in the Greek text is older and more original.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. Daniel |last=Hays |title=Reconsidering the Height of Goliath |journal=[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]] |volume=48 |issue=4 |date=December 2005 |pages=701–14 |url=http://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/48/48-4/JETS_48-4_701-714.pdf |format=[[Portable Document File]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goliath and Saul===
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 029.jpg|thumb|''David Presents the Head of Goliath to King Saul'', q1627, [[Rembrandt]]]]
The underlying purpose of the story of Goliath is to show that Saul is not fit to be king (and that David is). Saul was chosen to lead the Israelites against their enemies, but when faced with Goliath he refuses to do so; Goliath is a giant, and Saul is a very tall man. Saul's exact height is not given, but he was a head taller than anyone else in all Israel (1 Samuel 9:2), which implies he was over {{convert|6|ft|m}} tall and supposed to be the obvious challenger for Goliath, yet, David is the one who eventually defeated him. Also, Saul's armour and weaponry are apparently no worse than Goliath's (and David, of course, refuses Saul's armour in any case). "David declares that when a lion or bear came and attacked his father's sheep, he battled against it and killed it, [but Saul] has been cowering in fear instead of rising up and attacking the threat to his sheep (i.e. Israel)."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

=== Elhanan and Goliath ===
2 Samuel 21:19 tells how Goliath the [[Gittite]] was killed by "[[Elhanan son of Jair|Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim]], the Bethlehemite." According to Baruch Halperin, "Most likely, storytellers displaced the deed from the otherwise obscure Elhanan onto the more famous character, David."&lt;ref name=Halperin&gt;{{cite book |last1=Halpern |first1=Baruch |title=David's Secret Demons: Messiah, Murderer, Traitor, King |date=2003 |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |isbn=9780802827975 |page=7-10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tn8PG4XfuBAC&amp;pg=PA8 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The fourth-century BC [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] explains the second Goliath by saying that Elhanan "slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath", constructing the name Lahmi from the last portion of the word "Bethlehemite" ("''beit-ha’lahmi''"), and the [[King James Bible]] adopted this into 2 Samuel 21:18–19, although the Hebrew text at this point makes no mention of the word "brother".&lt;ref name=Halperin/&gt;

=== Goliath and the Greeks ===
The armor described in 1 Samuel 17 appears typical of Greek armor of the sixth century BCE rather than of Philistines armor of the tenth century. Narrative formulae such as the settlement of battle by [[single combat]] between champions has been thought characteristic of the [[Homeric epics]] (the ''[[Iliad]]''), rather than of the ancient Near East. The designation of Goliath as a {{lang|he|איש הביניים}}, "man of the in-between" (a longstanding difficulty in translating 1 Samuel 17) appears to be a borrowing from Greek "man of the ''{{transl|grc|metaikhmion}}'' ({{lang|grc|μεταίχμιον}})", i.e. the space between two opposite army camps where [[Champion warfare|champion combat]] would take place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berlinarchaeology.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/yadin-goliaths-armor.pdf Azzan Yadin, "Goliath's Armor and the Israelite Collective Memory"]. ''[[Vetus Testamentum]]'' 54:373–95 (2004). See also [[Israel Finkelstein]], "The Philistines in the Bible: A Late Monarchic Perspective", ''[[Journal for the Study of the Old Testament]]'', 27:131:67. For a brief online overview, see [http://www.heardworld.com/higgaion/?p=398 Higgaion], a blog by Christopher Heard, Associate Professor of Religion at Pepperdine University.&lt;/ref&gt;

A story very similar to that of David and Goliath appears in the [[Iliad]], written circa 760–710&amp;nbsp;BCE, where the young [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] fights and conquers the giant Ereuthalion.&lt;ref name="FinkelsteinSilberman2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Israel Finkelstein|author2=Neil Asher Silberman|title=David and Solomon: In Search of the Bible's Sacred Kings and the Roots of the Western Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hvq6JbIHBDEC&amp;pg=PA198|date=3 April 2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-4363-6|pages=198–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' Book 7 ll.132–160.&lt;/ref&gt; Each giant wields a distinctive weapon—an iron club in Ereuthalion's case, a massive bronze spear in Goliath's; each giant, clad in armor, comes out of the enemy's massed array to challenge all the warriors in the opposing army; in each case the seasoned warriors are afraid, and the challenge is taken up by a stripling, the youngest in his family (Nestor is the twelfth son of [[Neleus]], David the seventh or eighth son of [[Jesse]]). In each case an older and more experienced father figure (Nestor's own father, David's patron Saul) tells the boy that he is too young and inexperienced, but in each case the young hero receives divine aid and the giant is left sprawling on the ground. Nestor, fighting on foot, then takes the chariot of his enemy, while David, on foot, takes the sword of Goliath. The enemy army then flees, the victors pursue and slaughter them and return with their bodies, and the boy-hero is acclaimed by the people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Litchfield West|M.L. West]], ''The East Face of [[Helicon (river)|Helicon]]. West Asiatic Elements in Greek Poetry and Myth'', Clarendon Press, Oxford 1997 pp. 370, 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goliath's name===
[[Tell es-Safi]], the biblical [[Gath (city)|Gath]] and traditional home of Goliath, has been the subject of extensive excavations by Israel's [[Bar-Ilan University]]. The archaeologists have established that this was one of the largest of the Philistine cities until destroyed in the ninth century BC, an event from which it never recovered. A [[Sherd|potsherd]] discovered at the site, and reliably dated to the tenth to mid-ninth centuries BC, is inscribed with the two names "'''alwt'''" and "'''wlt'''". While the names are not directly connected with the biblical Goliath ("'''glyt'''"), they are etymologically related and demonstrate that the name fits with the context of late-tenth/early-ninth-century BC Philistine culture. The name "Goliath" itself is non-Semitic and has been linked with the [[Lydia]]n king [[Alyattes I|Alyattes]], which also fits the Philistine context of the biblical Goliath story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gath.wordpress.com/2006/02/16/comment-on-the-news-item-in-bar-on-the-goliath-inscription/ Tell es-Safi/Gath weblog] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080109230143/http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~maeira/Goliath/Goliath%20Inscription.html Bar-Ilan University]; For the editio princeps and an in-depth discussion of the inscription, see now: Maeir, A.M., Wimmer, S.J., Zukerman, A., and Demsky, A.

''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research''.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar name, Uliat, is also attested in [[Carian language|Carian]] inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Vernet Pons, M. (2012).

''Kadmos'', 51, 143–164.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aren Maeir]], director of the excavation, comments: "Here we have very nice evidence [that] the name Goliath appearing in the Bible in the context of the story of David and Goliath … is not some later literary creation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/tall-tale-of-a-philistine-researchers-unearth-a-goliath-cerealbowl/2005/11/14/1131951099130.html?oneclick=true | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |agency=[[Reuters]] | title=Tall tale of a Philistine: researchers unearth a Goliath cereal bowl | date=November 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later traditions ==

=== Jewish ===
According to the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Sotah (Talmud)|Sotah]] 42b) Goliath was a son of [[Orpah]], the sister-in-law of [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]], David's own great grandmother (Ruth → Obed → Jesse → David). [[Ruth Rabbah]], a haggadic and homiletic interpretation of the [[Book of Ruth]], makes the blood-relationship even closer, considering Orpah and Ruth to have been full sisters. Orpah was said to have made a pretense of accompanying Ruth but after forty paces left her. Thereafter she led a dissolute life. According to the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] Goliath was born by [[polyspermy]], and had about one hundred fathers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]] Yebamoth, 24b.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Talmud stresses Goliath's ungodliness: his taunts before the Israelites included the boast that it was he who had captured the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and brought it to the temple of [[Dagon]]; and his challenges to combat were made at morning and evening in order to disturb the Israelites in their prayers. His armour weighed 60 tons, according to rabbi [[Hanina]]; 120, according to rabbi [[Abba bar Kahana]]; and his sword, which became the sword of David, had marvellous powers. On his death it was found that his heart carried the image of Dagon, who thereby also came to a shameful downfall.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief overview of Talmudic traditions on Goliath, see [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=336&amp;letter=G Jewish Encyclopedia, "Goliath"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Pseudo-Philo]], believed to have been composed between 135&amp;nbsp;BC and 70&amp;nbsp;AD, David picks up seven stones and writes on them his father's name, his own name, and the name of God, one name per stone; then, speaking to Goliath, he says "Hear this word before you die: were not the two woman from whom you and I were born, sisters? And your mother was Orpah and my mother Ruth&amp;nbsp;..." After David strikes Goliath with the stone he runs to Goliath before he dies and Goliath says "Hurry and kill me and rejoice." and David replies "Before you die, open your eyes and see your slayer." Goliath sees an angel and tells David that it is not he who has killed him but the angel. Pseudo-Philo then goes on to say that the angel of the Lord changes David's appearance so that no one recognizes him, and thus Saul asks who he is.&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, James H. 1983. ''The Old Testament pseudepigrapha'' vol 2. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday. {{ISBN|0-385-18813-7}} p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
Goliath appears in chapter 2 of the [[Qur'an]] (2: 247–252), in the narrative of David and Saul's battle against the Philistines.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', G. Vajda, ''Djalut''&lt;/ref&gt; Called "{{transl|ar|Jalut}}" in Arabic ("{{lang|ar|جالوت}}"), Goliath's mention in the Quran is concise, though it remains a parallel to the account in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Muslim scholars have tried to trace Goliath's origins, most commonly with the [[Amalek]]ites.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;''Hughes Dictionary of Islam'', T.P. Hughes, ''Goliath''&lt;/ref&gt; Goliath, in early scholarly tradition, became a kind of byword or collective name for the oppressors of the [[Israelite]] nation before [[David]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Muslim tradition sees the battle with the Philistines as a prefiguration of [[Muhammad]]'s [[battle of Badr]], and sees Goliath as parallel to the enemies that Muhammad faced.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

==Adaptations==
[[File:Michelangelo, David and Goliath 02.jpg|thumb|David and Goliath by [[Michelangelo]], on the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]]]
American actor [[Ted Cassidy]] portrayed Goliath in the TV series ''Greatest Heroes of the Bible'' in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1095791/|title='Greatest Heroes of the Bible' David &amp; Goliath (TV episode 1978)|publisher=imdb|accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian actor [[George Eastman (actor)|Luigi Montefiori]] portrayed this nine-foot-tall giant in [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s 1985 live-action movie ''[[King David (film)|King David]]'' as part of a flashback. This movie includes the King of the Philistines saying, "Goliath has challenged the Israelites six times and no one has responded." It's then on the seventh time that David meets his challenge.

The PBS series ''[[Wishbone (TV series)|Wishbone]]'' featured Goliath in its first-season episode "Little Big Dog".

Big Idea's popular ''[[VeggieTales]]'' episode was called "[[Dave and the Giant Pickle]]", where [[Phil Vischer]] voiced Goliath.

In 1972, [[Toho]] and [[Tsuburaya Productions]] collaborated on a movie called ''[[Daigoro vs. Goliath]]'', which follows the story relatively closely but recasts the main characters as [[Kaiju]].

In 1975, Israeli band [[Poogy]] release a song called ''Golyat'' on the album [[Crowded in the Ear|''Tzafoof BaOzen'']], loosely and humorously based on the story.

[[Suzanne Vega]]'s song ''Rock In This Pocket (Song Of David)'' on the album [[99.9F°|''99.9°F'']] is based on the story.

In 2005, Lightstone Studios released a direct-to-DVD movie musical titled "One Smooth Stone", which was later changed to "David and Goliath". It is part of the [[Liken the scriptures|Liken the Scriptures]] (now just Liken) series of movie musicals on DVD based on scripture stories. [[Thurl Bailey]], a former NBA basketball player, was cast to play the part of Goliath in this film.

In 2009, [[NBC]] aired [[Kings (U.S. TV series)|Kings]] which has a narrative loosely based on the Biblical story of [[King David]], but set in a kingdom that culturally and technologically resembles the present-day United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/what-would-jesus-watch-82121|title=WHAT WOULD JESUS WATCH?|last=Alston|first=Joshua|date=16 July 2009|website=Newsweek|publisher=NEWSWEEK LLC|access-date=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The part of Goliath is portrayed by a tank, which David destroys with a shoulder fired rocket launcher.

Goliath was portrayed by [[Conan Stevens]] in the 2013 TV miniseries ''[[The Bible (TV miniseries)|The Bible]]''.

===Italian Goliath film series (1960–1964)===
The Italians used Goliath as an action superhero in a series of biblical adventure films ([[Peplum (film genre)|peplum]]s) in the early 1960s. He possessed amazing strength, and the films were similar in theme to their [[Hercules]] and [[Maciste]] movies. After the classic ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'' (1958) became a blockbuster sensation in the film industry, the 1959 [[Steve Reeves]] film ''Terrore dei Barbari'' (''Terror of the Barbarians'') was retitled ''[[Goliath and the Barbarians]]'' in the United States, (after [[Joseph E. Levine]] claimed the sole right to the name of ''Hercules''); the film was so successful at the box office, it inspired Italian filmmakers to do a series of four more films featuring a beefcake hero named Goliath, although the films were not really related to each other. (The 1960 Italian film ''David and Goliath'' starring [[Orson Welles]] was not one of these, since that movie was a straightforward adaptation of the Biblical story).

The four titles in the Italian ''Goliath'' series were as follows:
 
* ''Goliath contro i giganti''/''[[Goliath Against the Giants]]'' (1960) starring [[Brad Harris]]
* ''Goliath e la schiava ribelle''/''[[Goliath and the Rebel Slave]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Tyrant of Lydia vs. The Son of Hercules'') (1963) starring [[Gordon Scott]]
* ''Golia e il cavaliere mascherato''/''Goliath and the Masked Rider'' (a.k.a. ''[[Hercules and the Masked Rider]]'')  (1964) starring [[Alan Steel]]
* ''Golia alla conquista di Bagdad''/''Goliath at the Conquest of Baghdad'' (a.k.a. ''[[Goliath at the Conquest of Damascus]]'', 1964) starring [[Peter Lupus]]

The name Goliath was later inserted into the film titles of three other Italian muscle man movies that were retitled for distribution in the United States in an attempt to cash in on the Goliath craze, but these films were not originally made as Goliath movies in Italy.

Both ''[[Goliath and the Vampires]]'' (1961) and ''[[Goliath and the Sins of Babylon]]'' (1963) actually featured the famed superhero Maciste in the original Italian versions, but American distributors didn't feel the name Maciste had any meaning to American audiences. ''[[Goliath and the Dragon]]'' (1960) was originally an Italian Hercules movie called ''The Revenge of Hercules''.

==Modern usage of "David and Goliath"==
In modern usage, the phrase "David and Goliath" has taken on a secular meaning, denoting an [[Underdog (term)|underdog]] situation, a contest where a smaller, weaker opponent faces a much bigger, stronger adversary; if successful, the underdog may win in an unusual or surprising way.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="macmillan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/david-and-goliath | title=David and Goliath | encyclopedia=Macmillan Dictionary | accessdate=11 February 2015}} "used for describing a situation in which a small person or organization defeats a much larger one in a surprising way"&lt;/ref&gt; It is arguably the most famous underdog story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bibleodyssey.org/en/passages/main-articles/david-and-goliath.aspx | title=David and Goliath (1 Sam 17) | publisher=Society of Biblical Literature | accessdate=18 February 2015 | author=Bodner, Keith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theology]] professor Leonard Greenspoon, in his essay, "David vs. Goliath in the Sports Pages", explains that "most writers use the story for its underdog overtones (the little guy wins) ... Less likely to show up in newsprint is the contrast that was most important to the biblical authors: David's victory shows the power of his God, while Goliath's defeat reveals the weakness of the Philistine deities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bibleodyssey.org/en/passages/related-articles/david-versus-goliath-in-the-sports-pages.aspx | title=David vs. Goliath in the Sports Pages | publisher=Society of Biblical Literature | accessdate=12 February 2015 | author=Greenspoon, Leonard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is widely used in news media to succinctly characterize underdog situations in many contexts without religious overtones. Recent headlines include: sports ("Haye relishes underdog role in 'David and Goliath' fight with Nikolai Valuev"—''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/03/david-haye-nikolai-valuev-donald-mcrae | title=Haye relishes underdog role in 'David and Goliath' fight with Nikolai Valuev | work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London | date=3 November 2009 | accessdate=3 November 2009 | author=McRae, Donald}} Smaller boxer battles gigantic WBA world heavyweight champion.&lt;/ref&gt;); business ("On Internet, David-and-Goliath Battle Over Instant Messages"—''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/24/nyregion/on-internet-david-and-goliath-battle-over-instant-messages.html | title=On Internet, David-and-Goliath Battle Over Instant Messages | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=24 June 2000 | accessdate=27 March 2015 | author=Blair, Jayson}} Tiny online start-up battles Internet giant.&lt;/ref&gt;); science ("David and Goliath: How a tiny spider catches much larger prey"—''[[ScienceDaily]]'';&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/06/140612095035.htm | title=David and Goliath: How a tiny spider catches much larger prey | publisher=ScienceDaily | date=12 June 2014 | accessdate=10 February 2016}} Tiny spider preys on ants up to almost four times its size.&lt;/ref&gt; politics ("Dissent in Cuba: David and Goliath"—''[[The Economist]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.economist.com/node/1537865 | title=Dissent in Cuba: David and Goliath | work=[[The Economist]] | date=16 January 2003 | accessdate=27 March 2015}} "A one-party election faces a small but unprecedented challenge."&lt;/ref&gt;); social justice ("David-and-Goliath Saga Brings Cable to Skid Row"—''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/21/news/mn-6603 | title=David-and-Goliath Saga Brings Cable to Skid Row | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=21 November 2001 | accessdate=27 March 2015 | author=Rivera, Carla}} Skid row resident battles telecoms giant to win cable access.&lt;/ref&gt;).

{{about|the book by Francisco López de Gómara|the book by Oviedo|Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés}}
[[File:Almagro en el Cuzco.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Page from ''"Historia General de las Indias"'' "Almagro in Cuzco".]]
'''''Historia general de las Indias''''' (''General History of the Indies'') is the account by [[Francisco López de Gómara]] of the [[conquest of Mexico|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]]. The first printing was in December 1552, in the workshop of Agustín Millán in Zaragoza, published under the title ''Primera y segunda parte de la Historia General de las Indias con todo el descubrimiento y cosas notables que han acaecido dende que se ganaron hasta el año de 1551. Con la conquista de México de la Nueva España'' (''First and Second Parts of the General History of the Indies, with the Discovery and Notable Events that have Occurred Since They Were Won until the Year 1551. With the Conquest of Mexico of New Spain'')

The work was revised and published with different titles in subsequent years. The [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]] forbade publication in 1556, but it was published in other languages up to 1605. For almost one hundred and fifty years it fell out of publication. Modern editions usually focus on the portion of the text relating to the conquest of Mexico.

==Subsequent editions==
[[File:Toda la tierra de las Indias.jpg|thumb|Map of "the Indies" (America) in a 1553 edition of the Historia general de las Indias.]]
In 1553 the work was republished by the same publisher, and under the same name as the original. Another edition of the work published in the same year was titled ''Hispania Victrix, primera y segunda parte de la Historia General de las Indias con todo el descubrimiento y cosas notables que han acaecido dende que se ganaron hasta el año de 1551. Con la conquista de México de la Nueva España'' (''Hispania Victrix, First and Second Parts of the General History of the Indies, with the Discovery and Notable Events that have Occurred Since it was Won until the Year 1551. With the Conquest of Mexico of New Spain''), published in Medina del Campo, in the house of Guillermo de Millis. In this printing, the work has an introductory letter dedicated to the ''emperador de romanos y rey de España [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos I de España]], señor de las Indias y del Nuevo Mundo'' (''Emperor of the Romans and King of Spain Carlos V, Lord of the Indies and of the New World''):

{{cita|"Muy soberano señor: La mayor cosa después de la creación del mundo, sacando la encarnación y muerte del que lo crio, es el descubrimiento de Indias; y así, las llaman Mundo Nuevo. Y no tanto le dicen nuevo por ser nuevamente hallado, cuanto por ser grandísimo, y casi tan grande como el viejo, que contiene a Europa, África y Asia. También se puede llamar nuevo por ser todas sus cosas diferentísimas de las del nuestro. Los animales en general, aunque son pocos en especie, son de otra manera; los peces del agua, las aves del aires, los árboles, frutas, yerbas, y grano de la tierra que no es pequeña...." (''Very sovereign lord: The greatest thing after the creation of the world, excluding the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] and death of the one who created it, is the discovery of the Indies; and like this, they are called the [[New World]]. And not only do they say new for being newly discovered, so much as because they are gigantic, and almost as large as the [[Old World]], which holds Europe, Africa and Asia. It can also be called new because of all the very different things from the ones in our world. The animals in general, although few in species, are of another mode; the fish of the water, the birds of the air, the trees, fruits, grasses, and grains of the earth which aren't small.....'')|Francisco López de Gómara &lt;ref name="jcyl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/v2/contextos/10128.htm|title=Introducción. Gómara, el historiador - Contextos - ARTEHISTORIA V2|publisher=artehistoria.jcyl.es|accessdate=2014-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1554 the author added dates, for which reason the release was titled ''"La historia General de las Indias y Nuevo Mundo, con más de la conquista del Perú y de México"'' (''The General History of the Indies and the New World, with More on the Conquest of Peru and Mexico''), published in [[Zaragoza]] in the house of Pedro Bernuz.

In the second part, the author added a dedication to ''"muy ilustre señor don [[Martín Cortés, 2nd Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca|Martín Cortés]], marqués del Valle"'' (''Very illustrious Don Martín Cortés, marquess of the Valley'') :

{{cita|"A ninguno debo intitular, muy ilustre Señor, la Conquista de México, sino a vuestra señoría, que es hijo del que lo conquistó, para que, así como heredó el mayorazgo, herede también la historia. En lo que uno consiste la riqueza, y en otro la fama; de manera que andarán junto honra y provecho..." &lt;ref name="jcyl" /&gt;}} (''"To no one should I entitle, illustrious sir, the conquest of Mexico, but to your lordship, who is son of who conquered it, so that, as you inherited the [[majorat]], you inherit as well the history. In that one makes up the wealth, the other makes up the fame; in the way that honor and providence walk together..."'')|Francisco López de Gómara

The book was a success and was translated into Italian, French, and English. It was published in Rome, [[Venice]], Paris and London, with new editions outside of Spain published between 1556 until 1605.

In Spain, the publication of the book was banned by royal decree in 1556, which also ordered confiscation of copies already published.

==The sources==
Gómara never traveled to America, but he took note of news that reached Spain, aided by the limited maps of the conquered territories. His sources were [[manuscripts]] and writings of friar [[Toribio de Benavente|Toribio de Benavente "Motolinia"]], [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]], [[Pedro de Alvarado]], [[Andrés de Tapia]] and the interviews he had with [[Hernán Cortés]].

==Opinions of historians contemporary to Gómara==

The Peruvian writer known as "[[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]]" used the book as a source for his book, ''"[[Comentarios Reales de los Incas]]"''. A copy of ''Historia general de las Indias'' annotated by Garcilaso de la Vega remains extant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/nd/ark:/59851/bmc571c0&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco Cervantes de Salazar]] copied much of Gomara's book to make his ''"[[Crónica de la Nueva España]]"''.

On the other side, [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], who had been a soldier in the expeditions and conquests, heavily criticized the book in his ''"[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España]]"'', in particular because Gómara had never set foot in the Americas, and for the book's praising of Hernán Cortés, without giving credit to others involved. Nevertheless, he referenced the timeline of the work while composing his own account.

Friar [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] detested the book for its glorification of Hernán Cortés. The Spanish Crown also disagreed with the excessive glorification of Cortés.

==Banning==
The publication of the book was banned by royal decree, a ban reaffirmed during the reign of [[Philip II of Spain]] and which was in effect for many years. There was never a formal explanation for the ban, but it could have been because of the excessive praise of Cortés, for the criticisms directed at the [[Catholic Monarchs]], if not for the manner in which it referred to [[Francisco de los Cobos]], secretary of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos V]]. The writer had the consolation that it was published in other languages.

{{cita|"El Príncipe. Corregidores, asistente, gobernadores, alcaldes e otros jueces e justicias cualesquier de todas las ciudades, villa e lugares destos reinos e señoríos, e a cada uno y cualquier de vos a quien esta mi cédula fuere mostrada o su treslado signado de escribano público. Sabed que Francisco López de Gómara, clérigo, ha hecho un libro intitulado ''Historia de las Indias y Conquista de México'', el cual se ha impreso; y porque no conviene que el dicho libro se venda, ni lea, ni se impriman más libros dél, sino los que están impresos se recojan y se traigan al Consejo Real de las Indias de Su Majestad....."|Decree in the village of Valladolid, 17 November 1553 &lt;ref name="jcyl" /&gt;}}

"The Prince. [[Corregidor (position)|Correidors]], assistant, governors, mayors and other magistrates and justices of any kind in all the cities, villages and lands of these realms and [[seigneury|seigneuries]], and to everyone and anyone to whom this my decree is shown, or its copy signed by public notary. Know that Francisco López de Gómara, clergyman, has written a book titled ''Historia de las Indias y Conquista de México'', which has been printed; and because it is not advisable that said book be sold, nor read, nor have more copies printed, that rather those that are printed be collected, and brought to the Consejo Real de las Indias de su Majestad....."

==Later publications==
In 1584, the work was published in French, translated by [[Martin Fumée]], as ''Histoire generalle des Indes'', which was republished numerous times in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. This translation greatly influenced sixteenth-century French thinkers, among whom [[Michel de Montaigne]], who drew on Fumée's edition numerous times in writing his essay "Des coches" (1588, essay III, 6 of the [[Essais]]).

In 1749 Gómara's work was republished, included in the second of a three volume collection by [[Andrés González de Barcia]], entitled ''Historiadores primitivos de las Indias Occidentales, Vol II'' (''Primitive Historians of the Occidental Indies, Volume II'') published in [[Madrid]]. This was the third edition in Spanish.

In 1826 it was published under the title ''Historia de las conquistas de Hernando Cortés'' (''History of the Conquests of Hernando Cortés'') by the publisher Ontiveros in [[México]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Historia de las conquistas de Hernando Cortés|author1=de Gómara, F.L.|author2=de San Antón Múñon Chimalpain Quauhtlehuanitzin b. 1579, D.F.|author3=de Bustamante, C.M.|author4=de San Antón Muñón Chimalpahin Cuauhtlehuanitzin, D.F.|date=1826|issue=v. 1-2|publisher=la testamentaría de Ontiveros|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iMYNAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852 and 1854 part of the book was published in ''Historia de la Conquista del Perú'' (''History of the Conquest of Peru'')

In 1943 it was published with the title ''Historia de las Indias y Conquista de México'' (''History of the Indies, and the Conquest of Mexico'') by the publisher Pedro Robredo, in two volumes.

In 1954 it was reedited and titled ''Historia general de las Indias "Hispania victrix", cuya segunda parte corresponde a la Conquista de Méjico'' (''General History of the Indies "Hispania Victrix", Whose Second Part Corresponds with the Conquest of Mexico'') by the publisher Iberia.

In 1988 it was published as ''Historia de la conquista de México'' (''History of the Conquest of Mexico''), by the publisher Porrúa, in the collection "Sepan cuantos..".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2197">The '''Kitab al Miraj''' (Arabic: كتاب المعراج "Book of the Ascension") is a [[Islam|Muslim]] book concerned with [[Muhammad]]'s ascension into [[Heaven]] (known as the ''[[Isra and Mi'raj|Miraj]]''), following his miraculous one-night journey from [[Mecca]] to [[Jerusalem]] (the ''Isra'').  The book is divided into 7 chapters, and was written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] using the [[Naskh (script)|Naskh script]]. 

Kitab al-Miraj is believed to have been written by Abu'l-Qasim 'Abdalkarîm bin Hawâzin bin 'Abdalmalik bin Talhah bin Muhammad al-Qushairî al-Nisaburi  أبو القاسم عبد الكريم بن هوازن بن عبد الملك بن طلحة بن محمد القشيري (born 376 [[Hijri year|A.H.]]/ 986 [[Common Era|CE]] - died 465 [[Hijri year|A.H.]]/ 1072 [[Common Era|CE]]).

In the second half of the 13th century, the book was translated into [[Latin]] (as ''Liber Scale Machometi'') and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and soon thereafter (in 1264 [[Common Era|CE]]) into [[Old French]].&lt;ref&gt;I.

[[Chinese mythology]] has been described as "rich in stories about homosexuality", reflecting ancient Chinese perspectives toward variance in sexuality and gender, rather than modern views. Chinese myths and traditional folk tales are greatly influenced by religious beliefs, particularly [[Taoist]], [[Confucian]], and [[Buddhist]].

Myths include instances of changing gender and sexual activity between members of the same sex, or between humans and supernatural creatures that assume a form of the same sex.

==Sexuality in Chinese myths==
[[Image:Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea - Project Gutenberg eText 15250.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|"The [[Eight Immortals]] Crossing the Sea", from ''Myths and Legends of China'', 1922, E.T.C. Werner.]]
[[Chinese mythology]] has been described as "rich in stories about homosexuality".&lt;ref name=GLBTQchinese1&gt;Xiaomingxiong (2002), p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The mythological stories and folklore of China reflect ancient Chinese perspectives toward homosexuality, rather than modern views. These myths are greatly influenced by religious beliefs, particularly [[Taoist]] and  [[Confucian]], and later incorporated [[Buddhist]] teachings.&lt;ref name=GLBTQchinese1/&gt; Homosexuality in Chinese myths or folk tales may involve explicit physical contact, but may also be represented by more "profound emotions and feelings", making it difficult to unambiguously differentiate a homoerotic relationship from other social relationships, such as a friendship or rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;Louie (2002), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual activity in Chinese myth is often described metaphorically, for example, in military terms. This leads some readers to interpret scenes of combat figuratively, as sexual metaphors. Popular folk stories are generally more explicit about same-sex romantic encounters than later literary re-tellings.&lt;ref name=Louie25&gt;Louie (2002), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Male and female homosexuality were considered to be unrelated in ancient China, and there are very few descriptions of lesbianism in traditional Chinese texts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruan Fangfu|Ruan, Fang Fu]] and Bullough, Vern L; ''Lesbianism in China'', Archives of Sexual Behavior, Volume 21, Number 3 / June, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Taoist, pre-Confucian tradition of China was predominantly shamanistic, with the majority of shamans being female. Male same-sex love was believed to have originated in the mythical south, thus homosexuality is sometimes still called "Southern wind". From this period, numerous spirits or deities were associated with homosexuality, bisexuality and transgenderism. These include [[Chou Wang]], [[Lan Caihe]] - one of the [[Eight Immortals]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eberhard|first=Wolfram|title=A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols: Hidden Symbols in Chinese Life and Thought|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London|year=1986|isbn=0-415-00228-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/journals/jras/1916-21.htm |title=The Eight Immortals |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shan Gu]], and [[Yu the Great]], and [[Gun (Chinese)|Gun]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 12, "Chinese Shamanism..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious Taoism is generally considered to be [[polytheism|polytheistic]]. Its many deities, although unified by the idea and practice of Tao, are often pictured as part of a heavenly hierarchy that mirrors the bureaucracy of [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial China]]. According to the beliefs of Religious Taoism, Chinese deities may be promoted or demoted for their actions. Some deities are also simply exalted humans, such as [[Guan Yu]], the god of honor and piety. The particular deities worshipped vary according to geographical regions and historical periods in China, though the general pattern of worship is more constant.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero (1981), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual abstinence is seen as virtuous if it results from self-denial, allowing greater attention to spiritual or heroic matters. This is not the case if abstinence is the result of castration. [[Eunuch]]s in Chinese myths are usually portrayed as "greedy, temperamental and cowardly", with a similar lack of self-discipline as women.&lt;ref name=Louie91&gt;Louie (2002), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythical lands==
Women's Kingdom (or Women's Country) is a country situated in Southern Tibet or on an isolated Island. The island is believed to be inaccessible to normal travel due to its being surrounded by water of less-than-usual density, causing ships to sink. Occasional travellers have found themselves transported to the island by whirlwinds and reported that it is inhabited solely by women. These women have a fully functional community without men, and the only relationships are therefore between women. These women reproduce themselves by sleeping outdoors, where they become pregnant through the action of the southern wind blowing across their bodies, or by bathing in pools of water. Any male babies that are born die before the age of three.&lt;ref&gt;Werner (2008), p. 369, "Women's Kingdom"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Spark (1998), p. 349, "Women's Country".&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Women's Kingdom exists in folklore. This is a mythical land, in which men and women have their social roles reversed. Men are called women, and run the household while wearing traditional women's clothes. Conversely, women dress in men's boots and hats and are in charge of public affairs. The folk belief in this Women's Kingdom is best known from the eighteenth-century novel ''Romance of the Flowers in the Mirror''.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Spark (1998), p. 349, "Women's Kingdom".&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Dragon gods - Project Gutenberg eText 15250.jpg|thumbnail|right|180px|Dragon-gods, from ''Myths and Legends of China'', 1922 by E. T. C. Werner. Dragons sometimes sexually assaulted older men.]]

==Supernatural encounters==
Homosexual encounters are common in Chinese folk stories. The ''[[Xian (Taoism)|Xian]]'' (animal spirits or fairies) often choose same-sex partners, usually young men or boys.&lt;ref name=GLBTQchinese2&gt;Xiaomingxiong (2002), p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Some stories show Xian asking the Lord of the Fairies permission to stay with their male lovers for some time, which could be as long as years, due to time's passing differently in the fairy realm. If the Lord of the Fairies remembers, he may cut the relationship short, hence such relationships are often short, with melancholic endings as the human participant is abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 351, "Xian"&lt;/ref&gt; A Xian-human relationship is seen in the tale of "The Scholar and the Flower Spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 297, "The Scholar and the Flower Spirit"&lt;/ref&gt;

One exception to the age preference for younger men is shown by the [[dragon]], a powerful mythological beast, and a phallic symbol of male potency.&lt;ref name=Louie25&gt;Louie (2002), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Xiaomingxiong]], [[Chinese dragons]] "consistently enjoy sexual relationships with older men", one example being in the tale of "Old Farmer and a Dragon", in which a sixty-year-old farmer is forcibly sodomised by a passing dragon, resulting in wounds from penetration and bites that require medical attention.&lt;ref name=GLBTQchinese2/&gt;

Other stories that feature homoerotic interactions or transgender figures include "The Farmer and the Pig" and "Fox Fairy and a Scholar".&lt;ref name=GLBTQchinese3&gt;Xiaomingxiong (2002), p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legendary figures and deities==
[[Guan Yu]], the deified military leader, is described in legend as "unmoved by beautiful women".&lt;ref name=Louie26&gt;Louie (2002), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This has been read as denoting asexuality by most commentators, rather than a homosexual subtext, but in folklore his relationships with his (not blood-related) brothers are assumed to have a homoerotic component.&lt;ref name=Louie33&gt;Louie (2002), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the literature of some taoist schools included homosexuality as one of the forms of sexual misconduct, [[Tu Er Shen]] is a deity in Chinese folklore who is popularly said to manage the love and sex between homosexual men. His name literally means "[[rabbit]] deity". According to "The Tale of the Rabbit God" in the ''[[Zi Bu Yu]]'', Tu Er Shen was originally a man called Hu Tianbao, who fell in love with a handsome young imperial inspector of the Fujian Province. One day Hu Tianbao was caught peeping on the inspector, at which point he confessed his reluctant affections for the other man. The imperial inspector had Hu Tianbao sentenced to death by beating. Since his crime was one of love, underworld officials decided to right the injustice by delegating Hu Tianbao as the god and safeguarder of homosexual affections.&lt;ref&gt;Szonyi, Michael "The Cult of Hu Tianbao and the Eighteenth-Century Discourse of Homosexuality." Late Imperial China - Volume 19, Number 1, June 1998, pp. 1-25, The Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In order to cater to the needs of modern homosexuals, worship of the Rabbit God has been resuscitated in [[Taiwan]]: a temple was founded in [[Yonghe City]] by a gay, Taoist priest.&lt;ref&gt;"Taoist homosexuals turn to the Rabbit God: The Rabbit Temple in Yonghe enshrines a deity based on an historic figure that is believed to take care of homosexuals" by Ho Yi, staff reporter, ''Taipei Times,'' Sunday, October 21, 2007, Page 17 [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2007/10/21/2003384192]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Atlas maior 1655 - vol 10 - Novus Atlas Sinensis - cover - P1080377.JPG|thumb|right|upright|''Novus Atlas Sinensis'' by [[Martino Martini]] from the collection of Lilly Library]]
The Lilly Library was founded in 1960 with the collection of [[Josiah K. Lilly, Jr.]], owner of [[Eli Lilly and Company|Lilly Pharmaceuticals]] in [[Indianapolis]]. J.K. Lilly was a collector most of his life. From the mid-1920s until his death, he devoted a great deal of his leisure time to building his collections of books and manuscripts, works of art, coins, stamps, military miniatures, firearms and edged weapons, and nautical models. J. K. Lilly's collections of books and manuscripts, totaling more than 20,000 books and 17,000 manuscripts, together with more than fifty oil paintings and 300 prints, were given by the collector to Indiana University between 1954 and 1957. These materials form the foundation of the rare book and manuscript collections of the Lilly Library.

The extent to which J. K. Lilly realized his collecting goals was summed up by Frederick B. Adams, Jr., at the dedication of the Lilly Library on October 3, 1960: "Mr. Lilly's books cover so many fields that it is difficult to believe that any one man's enthusiasm could encompass them all. It is equally astounding that he was able to acquire so many books of such scarcity and quality in the short space of 30 years. Money alone isn't the answer; diligence, courage, and imagination were also essential. The famous books in English and American literature, the books most influential in American life, the great works in the history of science and ideas--all these are among the 20,000 Lilly books in this building."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/tour/foyer.shtml Indiana University; Lilly Library ]- Accessed 2012-01-08&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of '''magic in the Greco-Roman world''' is a branch of the disciplines of [[classics]], [[ancient history]] and [[religious studies]]. In [[classical antiquity]], including the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] world of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], historians and archaeologists view the public and private rituals associated with [[religion]] as part of everyday life. Examples of this phenomenon are found in the various state and cult [[ancient Greek temple|temples]], Jewish [[synagogue]]s and [[church (building)|churches]]. These were important hubs for ancient peoples, representing a connection between the heavenly realms (the [[divinity|divine]]) and the earthly planes (the dwelling place of [[human]]ity). This context of magic has become an academic study, especially in the last twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simpson |first1=Jacqueline |title=Review of The Athlone History of Witchcraft and Magic in Europe.

== Terminology ==
{{See also|Magi}}
Pervasive throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Eastern Mediterranean]] and [[Western Asia]] until [[late antiquity]] and beyond, ''mágos'', "Magian" or "magician", was influenced by (and eventually displaced) Greek ''[[Goetia|goēs]]'' (γόης), the older word for a practitioner of magic, to include astrology, alchemy and other forms of esoteric knowledge. This association was in turn the product of the Hellenistic fascination for [[Pseudo-Zoroaster|(Pseudo&amp;#8209;)Zoroaster]], who was perceived by the Greeks to be the "[[Chaldea]]n", "founder" of the Magi and "inventor" of both astrology and magic, a meaning that still survives in the modern-day words "[[magic (supernatural)|magic]]" and "magician".{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Authors William Swatos and Peter Kivisto define [[magic (supernatural)|magic]] as "any attempt to control the environment or the self by means that are either untested or untestable, such as charms or spells."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swatos|first=William H.|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6TMFoMFe-D8C&amp;pg=PA279|year=1998|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0-7619-8956-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
{{See also|Destruction of the Library of Alexandria#Decree of Theodosius, Christian destruction of the Serapeum in 391|Paganism}}
[[Herodotus]], [[Xenophon]], [[Plutarch]] – did use ''magos'' in connection with their descriptions of (Zoroastrian) religious beliefs or practices, the majority seem to have understood it in the sense of "magician". Accordingly, the more skeptical writers then also identified the "magicians" – i.e. individual magians – as charlatans or frauds. In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium]]'' (202e), the Athenian identified them as maleficent, allowing however a measure of efficacy as a function of the god [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Andrew|title=Porphyry's Place in the Neoplatonic Tradition: A Study in Post-Plotinian Neoplatonism|page = 71ff|location=The Hague|publisher=M.

According to one source magic in general was held in low esteem and condemned by speakers and writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert|last=Fowler|title=Greek Magic, Greek Religion|journal=Illinois Classical Studies|volume=20|date=1995|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Dieter Betz|Betz]] notes book burnings in regards to texts such as the [[Greek Magical Papyri]], when he cites [[Ephesus]] in the ''Acts of the Apostles'' (Acts 19: 10). And on the account of [[Suetonius]], Augustus ordered the burning of 2,000 magical scrolls in 13 BC. Betz states: {{quotation|"As a result of these acts of suppression, the magicians and their literature went underground. The papyri themselves testify to this by the constantly recurring admonition to keep the books secret. [..] The religious beliefs and practices of most people were identical with some form of magic, and the neat distinctions we make today between approved and disapproved forms of religion-calling the former "religion" and "church" and the latter "magic" and "cult" - did not exist in antiquity except among a few intellectuals. It is known that philosophers of the [[Neopythagorean]] and [[Neoplatonic]] schools, as well as [[Gnostic]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] groups, used magical books and hence must have possessed copies. But most of their material vanished and what we have left are their quotations."&lt;ref name="Betz"/&gt;}} [[Albrecht Dieterich]] noted the importance of the Greek Magical Papyri for the study of ancient religions because most of the texts combine several religions, Egyptian, Greek, or Jewish, among others.&lt;ref name="Betz"&gt;{{cite web|first=Hans Dieter|last=Betz|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo3684249.html|year=1992|title=The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, Including the Demotic Spells, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Parker, "magic differs from religion as weeds differ from flowers, merely by negative social evaluation"; magic was often seen as consisting of practices that range from silly superstition to the wicked and dangerous.&lt;ref name=parker&gt;{{cite book|last=Parker|first=Robert|title=Polytheism and Society at Athens|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-927483-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fairbanks|first=Arthur|title=A Handbook of Greek Religion|publisher=American Book Company|year=1910|quote=Magic was not at all foreign to Greek thought, but it was entirely foreign to the worship of the greater gods. ... Worship, in truth, was no more magic or barter than it was purely spiritual adoration.|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, magic seems to have borrowed from religion, adopting religious ceremonies and divine names, and the two are sometimes difficult to clearly distinguish.&lt;ref name=luck /&gt;{{rp|2}} Magic is often differentiated from religion in that it is manipulative rather than supplicatory of the deities.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Some mainstream religious rites openly set out to constrain the gods.&lt;ref name=luck /&gt;{{rp|3–4}} Other rough criteria sometimes used to distinguish magic from religion include: aimed at selfish or immoral ends; and conducted in secrecy, often for a paying client.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Religious rites, on the other hand, are more often aimed at lofty goals such as salvation or rebirth, and are conducted in the open for the benefit of the community or a group of followers.&lt;ref name=luck /&gt;{{rp|3}}

Religious ritual had the intended purpose of giving a god their just due honor, or asking for divine intervention and favor, while magic is seen as practiced by those who seek only power, and often undertaken based on a false scientific basis.&lt;ref name=parker /&gt;{{rp|123, 158}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burk|first=Walter|title=Greek Religion|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1985|isbn=978-0-631-15624-6|quote=Conscious magic is a matter for individuals, for a few, and is developed accordingly into a highly complicated pseudo-science.|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the practice of magic includes rites that do not play a part in worship, and are ultimately [[irreligious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mauss|title=A General Theory of Magic|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|pages=29–30|isbn=978-0-415-25396-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associations with this term tend to be an evolving process in ancient literature, but generally speaking ancient magic reflects aspects of broader religious traditions in the Mediterranean world, that is, a belief in magic reflects a belief in [[deities]], [[divination]], and words of power.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The concept of magic however came to represent a more coherent and self-reflective tradition exemplified by [[Magician (paranormal)|magicians]] seeking to fuse varying non-traditional elements of Greco-Roman religious practice into something specifically called magic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} This fusing of practices reached its peak in the world of the [[Roman Empire]], in the 3rd to 5th centuries [[Common Era|CE]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Thorndike comments: "Greek science at its best was not untainted by magic".&lt;ref name="Thorndike62"&gt;{{cite book|first=Lynn|last=Thorndike|title=Place of Magic in the Intellectual History of Europe|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greek Magical Papyri|magic papyri]] we have left to study, present more Graeco-Egyptian, rather than Graeco-Roman beliefs. Betz further notes: {{quotation|"In this [[syncretism]], the indigenous ancient Egyptian religion has in part survived, in part been profoundly [[hellenized]]. In its Hellenistic transformation, the Egyptian religion of the pre-Hellenistic era appears to have been reduced and simplified, no doubt to facilitate its assimilation into Hellenistic religion as the predominant cultural reference. It is quite clear that the magicians who wrote and used the Greek papyri were Hellenistic in outlook. Hellenization, however, also includes the egyptianizing of Greek religious traditions. The Greek magical papyri contain many instances of such egyptianizing transformations, which take very different forms in different texts or layers of tradition.&lt;ref name="Betz"/&gt;}}

==History==
===Magic in Homeric times===
{{Original research|section|date=September 2008}} &lt;!-- Heavily based of personal interpretation of primary source material. --&gt;
In [[Greek literature]], the earliest magical operation that supports a definition of magic as a practice aimed at trying to locate and control the secret forces (the sympathies and antipathies that make up these forces) of the world (''[[physis]]'' {{lang|grc|φύσις}}) is found in Book X of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' (a text stretching back to the early 8th century BCE).&lt;ref name=odyssey&gt;{{cite book|author=Homer|translator = E.

# The use of a mysterious tool endowed with special powers (the [[wand]]).
# The use of a rare magical herb.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Pliny in ''Natural History'' XXV, 10–12 states his belief that the "origin of botany" was closely aligned with what he saw as the practise of magic, he in fact notes that Medea &amp; Circe were early investigators of plants – and that Orpheus was the first writer on the subject of botany.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A divine figure that reveals the secret of the magical act (Hermes).

These are the three most common elements that characterize magic as a system in the later [[Hellenistic]] and greco-Roman periods of history.

Another important definitional element to magic is also found in the story. Circe is presented as being in the form of a beautiful woman (a temptress) when Odysseus encounters her on an island. In this encounter Circe uses her wand to change Odysseus’ companions into swine. This may suggest that magic was associated (in this time) with practices that went against the natural order, or against wise and good forces (Circe is called a witch by a companion of Odysseus).&lt;ref name=odyssey /&gt;{{rp|X:43}} In this mode it is worth noting that Circe is representative of a power (the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]]) that had been conquered by the younger [[Olympian gods]] such as [[Zeus]], [[Poseidon]] and [[Hades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hesiod|title=Theogony|trans-title=Birth of the Gods|translator = S.

===Magic in Classical Greece===
The 6th century BCE gives rise to scattered references of magoi at work in Greece. Many of these references representing a more positive conceptualisation of magic. Among the most famous of these Greek magoi, between Homer and the Hellenistic period, are the figures of [[Orpheus]], [[Pythagoras]], and [[Empedocles]].

====Orpheus====
Orpheus is a mythical figure, said to have lived in [[Thrace]] "a generation before Homer" (though he is in fact depicted on 5th-century ceramics in Greek costume).&lt;ref name=drury&gt;{{cite book|last=Drury|first=Nevill|title=Magic and Witchcraft: From Shamanism to the Technopagans|location=London|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=September 2008}} Orphism, or the Orphic Mysteries, seems also to have been central to the personages of Pythagoras and Empedocles who lived in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. Pythagoras for example is said to have described Orpheus, as, "the...father of melodious songs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pythagoras|volume=4|page=177}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Aeschylus]] (the Greek Playwright) later describes him as he who "haled all things by the rapture of his voice,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aeschylus|title=Agamemnon|page=16.30}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; this suggests belief in the efficacy of song and voice in magic. Orpheus is certainly associated with a great many deeds: the most famous perhaps being his descent to the underworld to bring back his wife, Eurydice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Euripides|title=Alcestis|page=357ff}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orpheus’ deeds are not usually condemned or spoken of negatively. This suggests that some forms of magic were more acceptable. Indeed, the term applied to Orpheus to separate him, presumably, from magicians of ill repute is ''theios aner'' or ‘divine man’.&lt;ref name=drury /&gt;{{rp|34}}

====Pythagoras====
[[File:Kapitolinischer Pythagoras.jpg|thumb|250px|Pythagoras of Samos.]]
Magical powers were also attributed to the famous mathematician and philosopher [[Pythagoras]] (c. 570 – 495 BCE), as recorded in the days of Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aristotle|title= Fragment 191|translator=Ross|edition=3rd|page=130ff}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burkert|first=Walter|title=Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism|pages=162ff|location=Cambridge, Mass.|publisher=Harvard University Press|date=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditions concerning Pythagoras are somewhat complicated because the number of Vitae that do survive are often contradictory in their interpretation of the figure of Pythagoras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Cornelia J. |editor-last=de Vogel|title=Greek Philosophy: A Collection of Texts Volume 1: Thales to Plato}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the magical acts attributed to him include:

# Being seen at the same hour in two cities.
# A white eagle permitting him to stroke it.
# A river greeting him with the words "Hail, Pythagoras!"
# Predicting that a dead man would be found on a ship entering a harbor.
# Predicting the appearance of a white bear and declaring it was dead before the messenger reached him bearing the news.
# Biting a venomous snake to death (or in some versions driving a snake out from a village).&lt;ref group=notes&gt;These miracles of Pythagoras are found in Hellenistic collections such as Apollonius’ Historia Thaumasiai VI or Aelian's Varia Historia II.26 and IV.17. Empedocles, the extant fragments / edited with an introduction, commentary, and concordance by M. R. Wright.&lt;/ref&gt; These stories also hint at Pythagoras being one of these "divine man" figures, ''theios aner'', his ability to control animals and to transcend space and time showing he has been touched by the gods.

====Empedocles====
Empedocles (c. 490 – c. 430 BCE) too has ascribed to him marvelous powers associated with later magicians: that is, he is able to heal the sick, rejuvenate the old, influence the weather and summon the dead.&lt;ref name=pliny&gt;{{cite book|author= Pliny, the Elder|translator= H. Rackham|translator2= D. E. Eichholz|translator3= W. H. S. Jones|title=Natural History|location=London|publisher=Heinemann|date=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|XXXVI:27}} E.R. Dodds in his 1951 book, ''The Greeks and the Irrational'', argued that Empedocles was a combination of poet, magus, teacher, and scientist.&lt;ref name=luck /&gt;{{rp|42}} Dodds argued that since much of the acquired knowledge of individuals like Pythagoras or Empedocles was somewhat mysterious even to those with a rudimentary education, it might be associated with magic or at least with the learning of a Magus.&lt;ref name=dodds1&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodds|first=E. R.|title=The Greeks and the Irrational|location=Berkeley, California|publisher=University of California Press|date=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145–46}}{{Failed verification|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- Misinterpretation or misrepresentation of pages --&gt;

It is important to note that after Empedocles, the scale of magical gifts in exceptional individuals shrinks in the literature, becoming specialized. Individuals might have the gift of healing, or the gift of prophecy, but are not usually credited with a wide range of supernatural powers as are magoi like Orpheus, Pythagoras and Empedocles. Plato reflects such an attitude in his Laws (933a-e) where he takes healers, prophets and [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] for granted. He acknowledges that these practitioners existed in Athens (and thus presumably in other Greek cities), and they had to be reckoned with and controlled by laws; but one should not be afraid of them, their powers are real, but they themselves represent a rather low order of humanity. An early Christian analogy is found in the 1st century CE writings of the Apostle Paul. Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians conceptualizes the idea of a limitation of spiritual gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible|volume=1 Corinthians|chapter=12:7–11}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=September 2008}}

===Magic in the Hellenistic period===
The Hellenistic period (roughly the last three centuries BCE) is characterized by an avid interest in magic, though this may simply be because from this period a greater abundance of texts, both literary and some from actual practitioners, in Greek and in Latin remains. In fact many of the [[Greek Magical Papyri|magical papyri]] that are extant were written in the 1st centuries of the [[Common Era]], but their concepts, formulas and rituals reflect the earlier Hellenistic period, that is, a time when the systematization of magic in the Greco-Roman world seems to have taken place—particularly in the ‘melting pot’ of varying cultures that was Egypt under the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] and under Rome.{{Original research inline|date=September 2008}}

The ascendancy of Christianity by the fifth century had much to do with this. This is reflected by the [[Acts of the Apostles]], where [[Paul the Apostle]] convinces many [[Ephesus|Ephesians]] to bring out their magical books and burn them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible|volume=Acts|chapter=19:18–20}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the magical papyri reflects various levels of literary skill, but generally they are standard Greek, and in fact they may well be closer to the spoken language of the time than to poetry or artistic prose left to us in literary texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|first = Hans Dieter|last=Betz|authorlink=Hans Dieter Betz|title= The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, Including the Demotic Spells|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1992|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many terms are borrowed, in the papyri, it would seem, from the mystery cults; thus magical formulas are sometimes called teletai (literally, "celebration of mysteries"), or the magician himself is called ''mystagogos'' (the priest who leads the candidates for initiation).&lt;ref name=hull&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Studies in Biblical Theology|last=Hull|first=John M.|title=Hellenistic Magic and the Synoptic Tradition|location=London|publisher=SCM PRESS|date=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23ff.}} Much Jewish lore and some of the names for [[God]] also appear in the magical papyri. ''Jao'' for [[Yahweh]], [[Sabaoth]], and [[Adonai]] appear quite frequently for example.&lt;ref name=mills&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=Mary E.|title=Human Agents of Cosmic Power in Hellenistic Judaism and the Synoptic Tradition|pages=49–62|volume=41|journal=Journal for the Study of the New Testament Supplement Series|location=Sheffield|publisher=JSOT Press|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;There is a number of other texts among the Greek magical papyri also indebted to Judaism for some of their content. There is a "Charm of Solomon that produces a trance" in PGM IV.850–929, but its religious content is otherwise pagan. Various versions of the "Eighth Book of Moses" appear in PGM XIII.1–343; 343–646; 646–734, followed by a "Tenth (?) Hidden [Book of] Moses" in 734–1077, but the content of these too, is almost entirely pagan.&lt;/ref&gt; As magicians are concerned with secrets it must have seemed to many outsiders of [[Judaism]] that Yahweh was a secret deity, for after all no images were produced of the Jewish God and God's real name was not pronounced, as the basis of speculation on magic.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The texts of the Greek magical papyri are often written as we might write a recipe: "Take the eyes of a bat..." for example. So in other words the magic requires certain ingredients, much as Odysseus required the herb Moly to defeat the magic of Circe. But it is not just as simple as knowing how to put a recipe together. Appropriate gestures, at certain points in the magical ritual, are required to accompany the ingredients, different gestures it would seem produce various effects. A magical ritual done in the right way can guarantee the revealing of dreams and the rather useful talent of interpreting them correctly. In other cases certain spells allow one to send out a daemon or daemons to harm one's enemies or even to break up someone's marriage.

This self-defined negative aspect to magic (as opposed to other groups defining your practices as negative even if you don’t) is found in various ‘[[curse tablet]]s,’ (tabellae defixionum) left to us from the Greco-Roman world.&lt;ref name="Crawley"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=A.E.|last=Crawley|title=Curses|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of religion and Ethics|volume=4|page=367ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term defixio is derived from the Latin verb defigere, which means literally "to pin down," but which was also associated with the idea of delivering someone to the powers of the underworld.&lt;ref name="Crawley" /&gt; It was also possible to curse an enemy through a spoken word, either in his presence or behind his back. But due to numbers of curse tablets that have been found it would seem that this type of magic was considered more effective. The process involved writing the victim's name on a thin sheet of lead along with varying magical formulas or symbols, then burying the tablet in or near a tomb, a place of execution, or a battlefield, to give spirits of the dead power over the victim. Sometimes the curse tablets were even transfixed with various items – such as nails, which were believed to add magical potency.&lt;ref name="Crawley" /&gt;

For most magic acts or rituals, there existed magics to counter the effects. [[Amulet]]s were one of the most common protections (or counter-magics) used in the Greco-Roman world as protection against such fearful things as curses and the [[evil eye]]; which were seen as very real by most of its inhabitants.&lt;ref name=pliny /&gt;{{rp|XXVIII:38, XXIX:66, XXX:138}} While amulets were often made of cheap materials, precious stones were believed to have special efficacy. Many thousands of carved gems were found that clearly had a magical rather than an ornamental function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bonner|title=Studies in magical amulets, chiefly Graeco-Egyptian}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barrett |first1=Caitlín E. |title=Plaster Perspectives on "Magical Gems": Rethinking the Meaning of "Magic" |url=https://antiquities.library.cornell.edu/gems/plaster-perspectives-on-magical-gems |website=Cornell Collection of Antiquities |publisher=[[Cornell University Library]] |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526164252/https://antiquities.library.cornell.edu/gems/plaster-perspectives-on-magical-gems |archivedate=May 26, 2015 |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 26 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Amulets were a very widespread type of magic, because of the fear of other types of magic such as curses being used against oneself. Thus amulets were actually often a mixture of various formulas from [[Babylonia]]n, [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] elements that were probably worn by those of most affiliations so as to protect against other forms of magic.&lt;ref name=burkitt&gt;{{cite book|first=F.

Crawfor Burkitt|title=Church and Gnosis: a study of Christian thought and speculation in the second century|pages=35ff|location=New York|publisher=AMS Press|date=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amulets are often abbreviated forms of the formulas found in the extant magical papyri.&lt;ref name=burkitt /&gt;

Magical tools were thus very common in magical rituals. Tools were probably just as important as the spells and incantations that were repeated for each magical ritual. A magician's kit, probably dating from the third century, was discovered in the remains of the ancient city of [[Pergamon]] in [[Anatolia]] and gives direct evidence of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/search?redirect=true&amp;lookup=Pergamon&amp;collection=|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805084508/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/search?redirect=true&amp;lookup=Pergamon&amp;collection=|deadurl=yes|title=Search Tools|date=5 August 2012|archivedate=5 August 2012|website=tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The find consisted of a bronze table and base covered with symbols, a dish (also decorated with symbols), a large bronze nail with letters inscribed on its flat sides, two bronze rings, and three black polished stones inscribed with the names of supernatural powers.&lt;ref name=luck&gt;{{cite book|first=Georg|last=Luck|title=Arcana Mundi – Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds|location=Baltimore|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What emerges then, from this evidence, is the conclusion that a type of permanence and universality of magic had developed in the Greco-Roman world by the Hellenistic period if not earlier. The scholarly consensus strongly suggests that although many testimonies about magic are relatively late, the practices they reveal are almost certainly much older. However the level of credence or efficacy given to magical practices in the early Greek and Roman worlds by comparison to the late Hellenistic period is not well known.

== High and low magic ==
Magical operations largely fall into two categories: [[theurgy]] ({{lang|grc|θεουργία}} and [[goetia]] ({{lang|grc|γοητεία}}. Theurgy in some contexts appears simply to try and glorify the kind of magic that is being practiced – usually a respectable priest-like figure is associated with the ritual.&lt;ref name=luck /&gt;{{rp|51}} Of this, scholar [[E. R. Dodds]] claims:
{{quote|[[Proclus]] grandiloquently defines theurgy as, 'a power higher than all human wisdom, embracing the blessings of divination, the purifying powers of initiation, and in a word all operations of divine possession' (''Theol. Plat.'' p. 63). It may be described more simply as magic applied to a religious purpose and resting on a supposed revelation of a religious character. Whereas vulgar magic used names and formula of religious origin to profane ends, theurgy used the procedures of vulgar magic primarily to a religious end..| E. R. Dodds, The Greek and the Irrational&lt;ref name=dodds1 /&gt;{{rp|291}}}}

In a typical theurgical rite, contact with divinity occurs either through the soul of the theurgist or medium leaving the body and ascending to heaven, where the divinity is perceived, or through the descent of the divinity to earth to appear to the theurgist in a vision or a dream. In the latter case, the divinity is drawn down by appropriate "symbols" or magical formulae.&lt;ref name=luck /&gt;{{rp|51}} According to the Greek philosopher [[Plotinus]] (205–270), theurgy attempts to bring all things in the universe into sympathy, and man into connection with all things via the forces that flow through them.&lt;ref name=luck /&gt;{{rp|52}} ''Theurgia'' connoted an exalted form of magic, and philosophers interested in magic adopted this term to distinguish themselves from the ''magoi'' or ''góētes'' ({{lang|grc|γόητες}}, singular {{lang|grc|γόης}} ''góēs'', "sorcerer, wizard") — lower-class practitioners. ''Goetia'' was a derogatory term connoting low, specious or fraudulent ''mageia''.&lt;ref name=luck /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Luck| first=Georg|authorlink=Georg Luck|date=1999|chapter=Witches and Sorcerers in Classical Literature|editor1=Ankarloo|editor2=Clark|title=Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Ancient Greece and Rome|pages=99, 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Richard|date=1999&lt;!--|title=Imagining Greek and Roman Magic--&gt;|editor1=Ankarloo|editor2=Clark|title=Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Ancient Greece and Rome|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Goetia'' is similar in its ambiguity to ''charm'': it means both ''magic'' and ''power to (sexually) attract''.

== Personages of the Roman Empire ==
There are several notable historical personages of the 1st century CE who have many of the literary characteristics earlier associated with the Greek "divine men" (Orpheus, Pythagoras and Empedocles). Of particular note are [[Jesus]] the Christ, [[Simon Magus]] and [[Apollonius of Tyana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A. D.|last=Nock|title=Beginnings of Christianity|volume=5|editor-first1=F.J.F.|editor-last1=Jacson|editor-first2=K.|editor-last2=Lake|pages=164ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=E. M.|authorlink=E. M. Butler|title=Myth of the Magus|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1993|pages=66ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an outsider's point of view Jesus was a typical miracle-worker. He exorcised daemons, healed the sick, made prophecies and raised the dead. As Christianity grew and became seen as a threat to established traditions of religion in the Greco-Roman world (particularly to the Roman Empire with its policy of emperor worship) Jesus (and by inference his followers) were accused of being magic users.&lt;ref name=hull /&gt;{{rp|38}} Certainly Christian texts such as the [[Gospels]] told a life story full of features common to divinely touched figures: Jesus’ divine origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible|chapter=John|volume=1}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; his miraculous birth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible|chapter=Luke|volume=1}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his facing of a powerful [[demon|daemon]] ([[Satan]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible|chapter=Luke|volume=4}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; being but a few examples.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;These themes are shared amongst divine men figures: Abaris yielded to Pythagoras, and Zoraster had to resist evil daemons for examples&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lurker|first=Manfred|title=Dictionary of Gods and Goddesses, Devils and Demons|location=London ; New York|publisher=Routledge and K. Paul|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gospel of Matthew]] claims that Jesus was taken to [[Egypt]] as an infant, this was actually used by hostile sources to explain his knowledge of magic; according to one rabbinical story, he came back tattooed with spells.&lt;ref name=mills /&gt;{{rp|93–108}}&lt;ref name="JesusMagician"&gt;{{cite book|first=M.|last=Smith|title=Jesus the Magician|pages=150ff.}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued in rabbinical tradition that Jesus was mad, which was often associated with people of great power (dynamis).&lt;ref name="JesusMagician" /&gt; Scholars such as [[Morton Smith]] have even tried to argue that Jesus was a magician. Morton Smith, in his book, [[Jesus the Magician]], points out that the Gospels speak of the "descent of the spirit," the pagans of "possession by a daemon,". According to Morton Smith both are explanations for very similar phenomena.&lt;ref name="JesusMagician" /&gt; If so this shows the convenience that using the term "magic" had in the Roman Empire – in delineating between what "they do and what you do". However Barry Crawford, currently Co-Chair of the Society of Biblical Literature's Consultation on Redescribing Christian Origins, in his 1979 review of the book states that "Smith exhibits an intricate knowledge of the magical papyri, but his ignorance of current Gospel research is abysmal", concluding that the work has traits of a conspiracy theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Barry|last=Crawford|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|date=1979|pages=321–22}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon is the name of a magus mentioned in the canonical book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 8:9ff, in apocryphal texts and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=R.S.|last=Casey|title=Beginnings of Christianity|chapter=5|pages=151ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Book of Acts Simon the Magus is presented as being deeply impressed by the apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]]'s cures and [[exorcisms]] and by the gift of the Spirit that came from the apostles’ laying on of hands; therefore, he "believed and was baptized". But Simon asks the apostles to sell him their special gift so that he can practice it too. This seems to represent the attitude of a professional magician. In other words, for Simon, the power of this new movement is a kind of magic that can be purchased – perhaps a common practice for magicians in parts of the Greco-Roman world. The Apostles response to Simon was emphatic in its rejection. The early church drew a strong line of demarcation between what it practiced and the practices of magic users.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;There is a parallel story in Acts 13:6–12. (though in this case perhaps an insider being chastised).{{Original research inline|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the church continued to develop this demarcation Simon comes under even greater scrutiny in later Christian texts. The prominent Christian author [[Justin Martyr]] for example, claims that Simon was a magus of [[Samaria]], and that his followers committed the [[blasphemy]] of worshiping Simon as God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Justin|last=Martyr|title=Dialogue with Trypho|chapter=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The veracity of this is not certain, but proves the desire of the early Christians to escape an association with magic.

The third magus of interest in the period of the Roman Empire is [[Apollonius of Tyana]] (c. 40 AD-c. 120 AD).&lt;ref name=maria&gt;{{cite book|first=Maria|last=Dzielska|authorlink=Maria Dzielska|title=Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History|location=Rome|date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30–38}} Between 217 and 238 Flavius [[Philostratus]] wrote his ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'', a lengthy, but unreliable novelistic source.&lt;ref name=maria /&gt;{{rp|12–49, 140–142}} Philostratus was a protégé of the empress [[Julia Domna]], mother of the emperor [[Caracalla]]. According to him, she owned the memoirs of one [[Damis]], an alleged disciple of Apollonius, and gave these to Philostratus as the raw material for a literary treatment. Some scholars believe the memoirs of Damis are an invention of Philostratus, others think it was a real book forged by someone else and used by Philostratus. The latter possibility is more likely. In any case it is a literary fake.&lt;ref name=maria /&gt;{{rp|12–13, 19–49, 141}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jaap-Jan|last= Flinterman|title=Power, Paideia and Pythagoreanism|location=Amsterdam|date=1995|pages=79–88}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Philostratus’ biography Apollonius emerges as an ascetic traveling teacher. He is usually labeled a new Pythagoras, and at the very least he does represent the same combination of philosopher and magus that Pythagoras was. According to Philostratus Apollonius traveled far and wide, as far as India, teaching ideas reasonably consistent with traditional Pythagorean doctrine; but in fact, it is most likely that he never left the [[Greek East]] of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name=maria /&gt;{{rp|19–84}} In Late Antiquity [[Amulet|talismans]] allegedly made by Apollonius appeared in several Greek cities of the Eastern Roman Empire, as if they were sent from heaven. They were magical figures and columns erected in public places, meant to protect the cities from plagues and other afflictions.&lt;ref name=maria /&gt;{{rp|99–127, 163–165}}

== Jewish tradition ==
Jewish tradition, too, has attempted to define certain practices as "magic". Some Talmudic teachers (and many Greeks and Romans) considered Jesus a magician, and magical books such as the ''Testament of Solomon'' and the ''Eighth Book of Moses'' were ascribed to Solomon and Moses in antiquity.&lt;ref name=luck /&gt;{{rp|57}} The ''[[Wisdom of Solomon]]'', a book considered [[apocryphal]] by many contemporary Jews and Christians (probably composed in the first century BCE) claims that
{{quote|God... gave me true knowledge of things, as they are: an understanding of the structure of the world and the way in which elements work, the beginning and the end of eras and what lies in-between... the cycles of the years and the constellations... the thoughts of men... the power of spirits... the virtue of roots... I learned it all, secret or manifest.&lt;ref name=luck /&gt;{{rp|58}}&lt;ref name=winston&gt;{{cite book|translator=David Winston|title=The Wisdom of Solomon|location=Garden City, N.Y.|publisher=Doubleday|year=1979|pages=172ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The Wisdom of Solomon, pp. 172ff. The author of this apocryphal book was clearly familiar with Middle Platonism and may have belonged to the circle of Philo of Alexandria. {{Original research inline|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mills /&gt;}}
Thus Solomon was seen as the greatest scientist, but also the greatest occultist of his time, learned in astrology, plant magic, daemonology, divination, and ''physika'' ({{lang|grc|φυσική}} "science").&lt;ref name=luck /&gt;{{rp|58}}
These are the central aims of magic as an independent tradition – knowledge and power and control of the mysteries of the cosmos. Such aims can be viewed negatively or positively by ancient authors. The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] for example, writes that: "God gave him [Solomon] knowledge of the art that is used against daemons, in order to heal and benefit men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Josephus|first=Flavius|translator=William Whiston|title=The Works of Josephus : Complete and Unabridged|edition=New updated|location=Peabody, Mass|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|date=1987|chapter=: Antiq. Jud. 8.45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere however, "there was an Egyptian false prophet [a magician] that did the Jews more mischief... for he was a cheat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Josephus|first=Flavius|translator=William Whiston|title=The Works of Josephus : Complete and Unabridged|edition=New updated|location=Peabody, Mass|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|date=1987|chapter = War. 2. 13. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of magic can thus be an idiom loosely defined in ancient thinking. But whether magic is viewed negatively or positively the substance of it as a practice can be drawn out. That is, that magic was a practice aimed at trying to locate and control the secret forces of the cosmos, and the sympathies and antipathies that were seen to make up these forces.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

== Authors of the Roman Empire ==
The ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] (CE 23/24-79)&lt;ref name=pliny /&gt; is a voluminous survey of knowledge of the late Hellenistic era, based according to Pliny on a hundred or so earlier authorities. This rather extensive work deals with an amazing variety of issues: cosmology, geography, anthropology, zoology, botany, pharmacology, mineralogy, metallurgy and many others. Pliny was convinced of the powers of certain herbs or roots as revealed to humanity by the gods. Pliny argued that the divine powers in their concern for the welfare of humanity wish for humanity to discover the secrets of nature. Pliny indeed argues that in their wisdom the gods sought to bring humans gradually closer to their status; which certainly many magical traditions seek – that is by acquiring knowledge one can aspire to gain knowledge even from the gods. Pliny expresses a firm concept is firmly being able to understand this "cosmic sympathy" that, if properly understood and used, operates for the good of humanity.&lt;ref name=pliny /&gt;{{rp|II:62}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodds|first=E. R.|title=The Ancient Concept of Progress and Other Essays on Greek Literature and Belief|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|date=1973|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While here lies expressed the central tenets of magic Pliny is by means averse to using the term "magic" in a negative sense. Pliny argues that the claims of the professional magicians were either exaggerated or simply false.&lt;ref name=pliny /&gt;{{rp|XXV:59, XXIX:20, XXVII:75}} Pliny expresses an interesting concept when he states that those sorcerers who had written down their spells and recipes despised and hated humanity (for spreading their lies perhaps?).&lt;ref name=pliny /&gt;{{rp|XXVII:40}} To show this Pliny link arts of the magicians of Rome with the emperor Nero (who is often portrayed negatively), whom Pliny claims had studied magic with the best teachers and had access to the best books, but was unable to do anything extraordinary.&lt;ref name=pliny /&gt;{{rp|XXX:5–6}}

Pliny's conclusion, however, is cautious: though magic is ineffective and infamous, it nevertheless contains "shadows of truth", particularly of the "arts of making poisons". Yet, Pliny states, "there is no one who is not afraid of spells" (including himself presumably).&lt;ref name=pliny /&gt;{{rp|XXVIII:4}} The amulets and charms that people wore as a kind of preventive medicine he neither commends or condemns, but instead suggests that it is better to err on the side of caution, for, who knows, a new kind of magic, a magic that really works, may be developed at any time.&lt;ref name=pliny /&gt;{{rp|XXVIII:4}}

If such an attitude prevailed in the Greco-Roman world this may explain why professional magicians, such as [[Simon Magus]], were on the lookout for new ideas. Pliny devotes the beginning of Book 30 of his work to the magi of Persia and refers to them here and there especially in Books 28 and 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=W. H. S. |authorlink1=W. H. S. Jones |title=The Magi in Pliny |journal=Proceedings of the Cambridge Philological Society |date=28 February 2013 |volume=1 |pages=7–8 |doi=10.1017/S0068673500002522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny defines the Magi at times as sorcerers, but also seems to acknowledge that they are priests of a foreign religion, along the lines of the [[druid]]s of the [[Celts]] in Britain and Gaul. According to Pliny, the art of the magi touches three areas: "[[healing]]," "[[ritual]]," and "[[astrology]]."&lt;ref name=pliny /&gt;{{rp|XXX:1}}

To the Platonist philosopher [[Plutarch]] (c. 45–125)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Plutarch|encyclopedia=Perseus Encyclopaedia|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0004%3Ahead%3D%237166}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; we owe the treatise ''[[On Superstition]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=F. J. E.|last=Harrison|title=Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion|edition=3rd|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1922|pages=4ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch defines "'[[superstition]]" as "fear of the gods." Specifically, he mentions that fear of the gods leads to the need to resort to magical rites and [[taboo]]s, the consultation of professional sorcerers and witches, [[amulet]]s and [[incantation]]s, and unintelligible language in prayers addressed to the gods.&lt;ref name="Brenk"&gt;{{cite book|first=E.|last=Brenk|title=In Mist Apparelled: Religious Themes in Plutarch's "Moralia" and "Lives" |location=Leiden|publisher=E.J. Brill|date=1977|page= 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Plutarch himself takes [[dream]]s and [[omen]]s seriously, he reserves superstition for those who have excessive or exclusive faith in such phenomena.&lt;ref name="Brenk" /&gt; Clearly, it is a matter of discrimination. He also takes for granted other magical practices, such as hurting someone by the evil eye.&lt;ref name="Brenk" /&gt; He also believes in daemons that serve as agents or links between gods and human beings and are responsible for many supernatural events in human life that are commonly attributed to divine intervention.&lt;ref name="Brenk" /&gt; Thus, a daemon, not [[Apollo]] himself, is the everyday power behind the [[Pythia]]. Some daemons are good, some are evil, but even the good ones, in moments of anger, can do harmful acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillon|title=Middle Platonists|pages= 216ff}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general then, Plutarch actually accepts much of what we today might define as superstition in itself.  So what he is really defining as superstition are those practices not compatible with his own philosophical doctrine.

A later [[Platonist]], [[Apuleius]] (born c. 125),&lt;ref name="Apuleius"&gt;Apuleius. and John A. Hanson, Metamorphoses (Cambridge, London: Harvard University Press, 1989).{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives us a substantial amount of information on contemporary beliefs in magic, though perhaps through no initial choice of his own. Apuleius was accused of practicing magic, something outlawed under Roman law. The speech he delivered in his own defense against the charge of magic, in c. 160 CE, remains and it is from this Apologia that we learn how easy it was, at that time, for a philosopher to be accused of magical practices.&lt;ref name="Apuleius"/&gt;{{rp|loc=Introduction}} Perhaps in a turn of irony or even a tacit admission of guilt, Apuleius, in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (or ''[[The Golden Ass]]''), which perhaps has autobiographical elements, allows the hero, Lucius, to dabble in magic as a young man, get into trouble, be rescued by the goddess Isis, and then finds true knowledge and happiness in her mysteries.&lt;ref name="Tatum_28_29"&gt;{{cite book|first=J.|last=Tatum|title=Apuleius and the Golden Ass|location=Ithaca, New York|publisher= Cornell University Press|date=1979|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Plutarch, Apuleius seems to take for granted the existence of daemons. They populate the air and seem to, in fact, be formed of air. They experience emotions just like human beings, and despite this their minds are rational.&lt;ref name="Tatum_28_29" /&gt; In light of Apuleuis’ experience it is worth noting that when magic is mentioned in Roman laws, it is always discussed in a negative context. A consensus was established quite early in Roman history for the banning of anything viewed as harmful acts of magic. The laws of the [[Twelve Tables]] (451–450 BCE) for example expressly forbid anyone from enticing his neighbors’ crops into his fields by magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Cavendish|title=History of Magic|location=London|publisher=Arkana|date=1987|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=September 2008}} An actual trial for alleged violation of these laws was held before [[Spurius Albinus]] in 157 BCE.&lt;ref name=pliny /&gt;{{rp|XVIII:41–43}} It is also recorded that [[Cornelius Hispallus]] expelled the [[Chaldea]]n [[astrologers]] from Rome in 139 BCE ostensibly on the grounds that they were magicians.&lt;ref name="Tavenner_13"&gt;{{cite book|first=Eugene|last=Tavenner|title=Studies in Magic from Latin Literature|page=13}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 33 BCE, astrologers and magicians are explicitly mentioned as having been driven from Rome.&lt;ref name="Tavenner_13" /&gt; Twenty years later, [[Augustus]] ordered all books on the magical arts to be burned. In 16 CE magicians and astrologers were expelled from Italy, and this was reinstated by edicts of [[Vespasian]] in 69 CE and Domitian in 89 CE. The emperor [[Constantine I]] in the 4th century CE issued a ruling to cover all charges of magic. In it he distinguished between helpful charms, not punishable, and antagonistic spells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liebeschuetz|title=Continuity and Change in Roman Religion|pages=126–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases Roman authorities specifically decided what forms of magic were acceptable and which were not. Those that were not acceptable were termed "magic"; those that were acceptable were usually defined as traditions of the state or practices of the state's religions.

== Summary ==
John Middleton argues in his article "Theories of Magic"" in the ''Encyclopaedia of Religion'' that:

''Magic is usually defined subjectively rather than by any agreed upon content. But there is a wide consensus as to what this content is. Most peoples in the world perform acts by which they intend to bring about certain events or conditions, whether in nature or among people, that they hold to be the consequences of those acts.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=John|last=Middleton|title= Theories of Magic|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Religion|volume=9|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this view, the various aspects of magic that described, despite how the term "magic" may be defined by various groupings within the Greco-Roman world, is in fact part of a broader cosmology shared by most people in the ancient world. But it is important to seek an understanding of the way that groups separate power from power, thus "magic" often describes an art or practices that are much more specific. This art is probably best described, as being the manipulation of physical objects and cosmic forces, through the recitation of formulas and incantations by a specialist (that is a magus) on behalf of him/herself or a client to bring about control over or action in the divine realms. The Magical texts examined in this article, then, are ritual texts designed to manipulate divine powers for the benefit of either the user or clients. Because this was something done in secret or with foreign methods these texts represent an art that was generally looked upon as illegitimate by official or mainstream magical cults in societies.

==Background==
Mahoe leased a building from Fair Investments. At the end of the 4 years lease, both parties agreed orally to renew the lease.

However, as such leases to be legally enforceable under the Contracts Enforcement Act [1956], they must be in writing, and not merely agreed orally.

Later, one of the parties tried to get out of the lease, on the basis that it was not legally enforceable as the lease renewal was not put in writing.

The other party claimed, that even though it was not put in writing, the lease was still legally enforceable due to the doctrine of part performance.

==Held==
The court ruled that the doctrine of part performance applied here, making the renewal of the lease legally enforceable.

The '''Military Gallery''' ({{lang-ru|Военная галерея}}) is a gallery of the [[Winter Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. The gallery is a setting for 332 [[portrait]]s of [[Russian military ranks|generals]] who took part in the [[Napoleon's Invasion of Russia|Patriotic War of 1812]]. The portraits were painted by [[George Dawe]] and his Russian assistants [[Alexander Polyakov (artist)|Alexander Polyakov]] (1801-1835), a [[serf]], and [[Wilhelm August Golicke]].

The top-lit barrel-vaulted hall in which the gallery is accommodated was designed by architect [[Carlo Rossi (architect)|Carlo Rossi]] and constructed from June to November 1826. It replaced several small rooms in the middle of the main block of the Winter Palace - between the White Throne Hall and the Greater Throne Hall, just a few steps from the palace church. The gallery was opened in a solemn ceremony on 25 December 1826.
[[Image:1812Gallerylocation.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Plan showing the location of the Military Gallery within the palace]]
Less than ten years after its completion, it was destroyed by fire in 1837. The fire burned slowly and Dawe's portraits were saved from the flames. The architect [[Vasily Stasov]] recreated the hall exactly as it had been before.

As a cadet of the Nicholas Cavalry School, [[Vladimir Littauer]] was posted in 1912 to stand night-time guard in the Military Gallery. He describes the experience as an eerie one, standing under the rows of portraits in the "huge hall" lit only by a single bulb over a cluster of banners. The isolation of the solitary sentry was emphasized by the two to three minutes that footsteps could be heard down halls and corridors before the replacement guard arrived in the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Vladimir|last=Littauer|page=24|title=Russian Hussar|ISBN=1-59048-256-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
    
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, the gallery collection was enhanced by four portraits of [[grenadiers|Palace Grenadiers]], the special ceremonial unit created in 1827 from veterans of the [[Patriotic War of 1812]] to guard the entire building. The portraits were also painted by George Dawe, in 1828. More recently, the gallery acquired two paintings by [[Peter von Hess]] from the 1840s.

Today, as part of the [[State Hermitage Museum]], this room retains its original decoration.

'''Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC''' ({{lse|MONY}}) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[price comparison]] website-based  business specialising in financial services. The website enables consumers to compare prices on a range of products, including [[car insurance]], [[home insurance]], [[travel insurance]], [[mortgages]], [[credit cards]] and [[loans]]. The company also purchased [[MoneySavingExpert.com]] for £80 million from [[Martin Lewis (financial journalist)|Martin Lewis]] in 2012, becoming a subsidiary of Moneysupermarket. He remains a shareholder in the parent company, selling a small percentage of shares in 2015.

Moneysupermarket is listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[FTSE 250 Index]].

==History==
[[Simon Nixon]] founded two businesses in the mortgage market in the late 1980s, which eventually became Moneysupermarket.

This began when he established a mortgage subscription business in 1987. Nixon was a student at the [[University of Nottingham]] studying accounting, while also working a job selling mortgages. While working in the role, he noticed after a number of months there was no easy way for brokers to compare all the mortgage deals available. He worked evenings and weekends setting up best-buy tables so he could send out information to those who required it. He began it as a free service, before charging subscriptions at £11 a fortnight. After two years in business, Nixon was earning £10,000 a month from his subscription business, offering [[mortgage]] advice via post.&lt;ref name="moneyweek"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hohler|first1=Emily|title=My first million: Simon Nixon of Moneysupermarket|url=https://moneyweek.com/my-first-million-simon-nixon-of-moneysupermarket/|publisher=[[MoneyWeek]]|date=July 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, he persuaded Duncan Cameron to quit is IT degree course at [[Liverpool University]] and assist him with expanding the business. Together they formed Mortgage 2000 just as computers and the [[Internet]] were becoming regular fixtures in offices across the UK. Mortgage 2000 was aimed at accounting firms and financial advisors who had access to the Internet. Instead of simply offering a fortnightly update via post, subscribers could log on and check deals real-time via Mortgage 2000. The stats were updated daily, rather than fortnightly.&lt;ref name=moneyweek /&gt;

This expansion was hugely successful in the financial sector in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Higgins|first1=Ria|title=A Life in the Day: Simon Nixon, internet entrepreneur|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/a-life-in-the-day-simon-nixon-internet-entrepreneur-93krfxzbt5w|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, the Internet expanded from an office-based service into people's homes. Nixon spoke to [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] about spotting an opportunity when [[Freeserve]] began to offer free access to the Internet for homeowners in 1999 and saw a rapid expansion in Moneysupermarket from that point forward. Initially the website focused on a number of small comparison and sourcing markets for personal loans and [[credit cards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thelwell|first1=Emma|title=Simon Nixon: UK's richest young entrepreneur|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2954737/Simon-Nixon-UKs-richest-young-entrepreneur.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=February 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of providing [[Independent Financial Advisor]]s with the information, Moneysupermarket.com was marketed as a business to consumer business to compliment their ''Mortgage 2000'' offering.&lt;ref name=moneyweek /&gt; Nixon and Duncan made commissions varying from 30p to £30 for different deals their users signed up for in the year days. As these figures began to add up, they shut Mortgage 2000 and began to offer mortgage comparisons on Moneysupermarket.com.&lt;ref name=moneyweek /&gt;

This caused strain between the co-founders as Duncan was brought on board to run the IT side of Mortgage 2000. Once the potential for Moneysupermarket was realised, Mortgage 2000 only had limited potential. The focus away from Mortgage 2000 led Duncan to stop getting involved in the business in early 2002, but remained as a [[wikt:silent partner|silent partner]] in the business.&lt;ref name="independent2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prosser|first1=David|title=Simon Nixon: Checkout tills ringing for internet guru|url=https://www.independent.co.uk:80/news/business/analysis-and-features/simon-nixon-checkout-tills-ringing-for-internet-guru-452422.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|archivedate=2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507003614/http://www.independent.co.uk:80/news/business/analysis-and-features/simon-nixon-checkout-tills-ringing-for-internet-guru-452422.html|date=June 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Connon|first1=Heather|title=The man who made the tills ring at Moneysupermarket|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/22/business.newmedia|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Moneysupermarket announced their first major expansion with the launch of [[Travelsupermarket.com]]. The website ran in the same way as Moneysupermarket, but compared prices for a different market. Pricing for the travel market at the time wasn't [[consumer]]-friendly, often providing a "price from" advertisement. The initial goal of Travelsupermarket was to provide transparent pricing, describing the exact differences between the different prices provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berman|first1=Chloe|title=Interview: Travelsupermarket.com commercial director Chris Nixon|url=http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/articles/25916/interview-travelsupermarketcom-commercial-director-chris-nixon|publisher=Travel Weekly|date=November 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moneysupermarket was recognised in 2002 by [[The Sunday Times]]' Fast Track 100, as one of the fastest growing companies in the UK. The awards measured three financial years, between 2000 and 2002, to study the growth of the business. MoneySupermarket were judged to be the 80th fastest growing tech business in the [[United Kingdom]] during the three-year period. The company's sales grew from £5.4 million in 2000 to £13.6 million in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fasttrack.co.uk/company_profile/moneysupermarket-com-4/|title=Moneysupermarket.com - Fast Track|last=TWK|work=Fast Track|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of Moneysupermarket, [[Simon Nixon]] was announced as Entrepreneur of the Year at the National Business Awards in 2003.

By 2006, the group earned pre-tax profits of £11.7 million on revenues of £105m.&lt;ref name="moneyweek" /&gt; A year later, [[The Guardian]] announced that the website was processing 52% of all the price comparisons in the UK.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; In June 2007, Duncan Cameron sold his 47% stake in the business to co-founder [[Simon Nixon]] for £162 million.&lt;ref name="independent2"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that for household and car insurance, price comparison websites such as moneysupermarket.com rarely include all products on the market and that price comparisons are consequently incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/jun/22/insurance|title=Take care when using price comparison websites|date=2007-06-21|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after [[Simon Nixon]] became the main shareholder in the business, Moneysupermarket announced that the company was to be listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2812909/Moneysupermarket.com-IPO-disappoints.html|title=Moneysupermarket.com IPO disappoints|last=Bland|first=Ben|date=2007-07-26|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the floatation, the [[Financial Times]], [[The Guardian]] and [[The Independent]], all reported that the group had been valued at around £1 billion at the time of its [[initial public offering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/5f7f208c-2f76-11dc-a68f-0000779fd2ac|title=IPO values Moneysupermarket at £1bn|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/29/citynews.newmedia|title=Moneysupermarket.com to go public|last=Wearden|first=Graeme|date=2007-06-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/money/spend-save/comparison-sites-do-they-find-you-the-best-deals-1029634.html|title=Comparison sites: do they find you the best deals?|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floatation valuation was seen at the time as one of the largest tech IPOs in the [[United Kingdom]] for a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://citywire.co.uk/money/moneysupermarket-com-to-float-as-largest-lse-tech-stock-in-years/a284597|title=Moneysupermarket.com to float as largest LSE tech stock in years|work=Citywire Money|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Moneysupermarket announced that they had purchased [[MoneySavingExpert.com]] in a deal worth £87 million. After the acquisition was completed in September of that year, MoneySavingExpert remained as an editorially independent platform, as part of the contractually binding Editorial Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osborne|first1=Hilary|title=Martin Lewis sells MoneySavingExpert for £87m|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jun/01/martin-lewis-sells-moneysavingexpert|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founder, [[Martin Lewis (financial journalist)|Martin Lewis]], announced that he would remain as the chief editor of the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Lewis sells MoneySavingExpert.com for £87m|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18295587|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moneysupermarket announced in 2015 that [[Martin Lewis (financial journalist)|Martin Lewis]] would be selling 1.6% of his shares in Moneysupermarket, reducing his overall holdings in the company to 1.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Lewis nets £25m after selling Moneysupermarket.com shares|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/31/saving-expert-martin-lewis-sells-25m-moneysupermarket-shares|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cunningham|first1=Tara|title=Martin Lewis makes £25m from MoneySuperMarket share sale|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/11775753/Martin-Lewis-makes-25m-from-MoneySuperMarket-share-sale.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moneysupermarket recruited a new chief executive in October 2016 to replace Peter Plumb, who would be leaving the group in May 2017. Mark Lewis was announced as the new chief executive and had previously served as retail director at [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClean|first1=Paul|title=Moneysupermarket names John Lewis retail director as chief|url=https://www.ft.com/content/1bf0a4ac-9c55-11e6-a6e4-8b8e77dd083a|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was tipped to become its managing director before joining Moneysupermarket. In an interview with [[The Guardian]] he stated he wanted to return to digital retail after working with both CollectPlus and [[eBay]] previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kollewe|first1=Julia|title=Moneysupermarket appoints Mark Lewis as chief executive|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/moneysupermarket-appoints-mark-lewis-as-chief-executive|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third quarter of 2017, Moneysupermarket announced slight dips in their money and home services operations, but overall saw an increase on the previous year’s figures. The group reported a total revenue of £90.2 million, a six percent increase when compared to the previous year’s Q3 revenue figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityam.com/274003/moneysupermarketcom-reports-increased-revenue-third-quarter|title=Moneysupermarket.com reports increased revenue in third quarter of the year|last=|first=|date=|website=City A.M.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's best performer was its insurance revenues, which grew by 11 percent compared to the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/95a00d0f-d493-3770-8bc8-ebf82a20eefe|title=Moneysupermarket Q3 revenue rises 6%|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
From 2003 to 2006, Moneysupermarket underwent a ninefold growth in traffic. This resulted in them deploying an enterprise management and monitoring system to track availability and increase internal understanding of the users' experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Annesley|first1=Christian|title=Moneysupermarket plots usage for growth|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240076401/Moneysupermarket-plots-usage-for-growth|publisher=[[Computer Weekly]]|date=January 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sites such as Moneysupermarket collect data directly from merchants used to find quotations for any given comparison market. Retailers can also supply Moneysupermarket with products and prices by manually submitting their own lists. These would then be matched up against the original database so there aren't any duplications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How The MoneySuperMarket Site Works|url=http://www.moneysupermarket.com/hubs/how-moneysupermarket-works/|publisher=Moneysupermarket}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data feed files can also be used to collect data. In this scenario, a merchant would provide Moneysupermarket with information electronically in a set format. Like other [[comparison shopping website]]s, Moneysupermarket has previously used third-party [[affiliate network|affiliate]] networks to receive information and aggregate data. Another method used is to [[Web crawler|crawl]] the web for prices. This effectively takes away the submission aspect of smaller merchants, while Moneysupermarket still provide their clients with accurate pricing. It was estimated that this method was initially used in the early days of price comparison.&lt;ref name=explainedtelegraph&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Emma|title=Comparison sites explained|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/money-saving-tips/8368276/Comparison-sites-explained.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[comparison shopping website]]s such as Moneysupermarket have been able to use their inventory data to place retailer prices on a blog or content website as an advert. In return, the owner of that website will receive a commission percentage from Moneysupermarket. While this effects the overall commission earned by Moneysupermarket from merchants, it increases traffic and is now a common method used by comparison websites to drive traffic.&lt;ref name=explainedtelegraph /&gt;

==Operations==

===Moneysupermarket===
[[Simon Nixon]] founded Moneysupermarket.com, which is the main source of revenue for the Moneysupermarket group. Following the amalgamation of a number of companies dating back to 1989, Nixon formed the largest UK-based comparison website for insurance, finance, energy and a number of other markets. To date, it is the largest [[Comparison shopping website|comparison website]] in the UK by revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ralph|first1=Oliver|title=Going gets tough for GoCompare the SuperMeerkat|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8997ec7a-2f01-11e6-bf8d-26294ad519fc|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travelsupermarket===
Travelsupermarket was founded in 2000, as a travel comparison website and subsidiary of the Moneysupermarket.com group. Initially it competed with sites such as [[Expedia]] and [[Skyscanner]]. In 2005, it was named the best online travel company in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Results of the survey - Travel Awards 2005|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/733759/Results-of-the-survey.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=October 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MoneySavingExpert===
[[MoneySavingExpert.com]] is a subsidiary of the Moneysupermarket group, after it was acquired from [[Martin Lewis (financial journalist)|Martin Lewis]] in 2012 for a deal in the region of £87 million. It was founded in February 2003, after Lewis believed the UK needed a resource to provide basic financial advice.&lt;ref name=MSEabout&gt;MoneySavingExpert.com, [http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/site/about-the-site About]&lt;/ref&gt; The site had grown to attract 13 million monthly users by 2012, with 7 million subscribers opting in to receive weekly emails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/martin-lewis-sells-moneysavingexpertcom-for-87m-7810705.html |title=Martin Lewis sells MoneySavingExpert.com for £87m |first=Ellen E |last=Jones |work=The Independent |date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, he sold the website while remaining editor-in-chief.

In 2013, the group announced the launch of the Cheap Energy Club by Moneysupermarket subsidiary, [[MoneySavingExpert.com]]. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, stated in a number of interviews that he believed the energy market was broken. The service monitors the users energy tariff to ensure they are on the cheapest gas and electricity deal. The scheme requires the user to input data regarding your current [[energy tariff]]s and state the amount of saving for which you would be willing to switch [[Public electricity supplier|provider]]s. Tariffs that are available are then reviewed every month and you are notified when switching would trigger your target saving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gammell|first1=Kara|title=Moneysavingexpert.com launches 'Cheap Energy Club'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/household-bills/9847889/Moneysavingexpert.com-launches-Cheap-Energy-Club.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Moneysupermarket has a [[research]] arm, which frequently releases data about [[Britons]] and common trends they spot in their data. With energy consumption, the group released statistics suggesting that the UK wasted £1.6 billion on energy bills each year from leaving devices such as televisions on standby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/how-much-money-you-waste-11669591|title=This is how much money you waste each year by leaving devices on standby|last=Robson|first=Steve|date=2017-12-10|work=mirror|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other domestic trends spotted by the groups research found that a TV subscription costing UK households £357 annually could be reduced dramatically through [[Streaming media|streaming services]], often to less than £100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/tv-prices-rising-cut-the-cost-with-streaming-deals/|title=TV prices rising?

In February 2018, the group's research found that 20 percent of [[Scotland]] had never switched energy provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/nearly-a-fifth-of-scottish-households-have-never-switched-energy-provider/|title=Nearly a fifth of Scottish households have never switched energy provider - Sunday Post|work=Sunday Post|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adverts==
In 2010, adverts featured comedian [[Omid Djalili]] as the character of "HaggleHero".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2009/dec/30/omid-djalili-moneysupermarket|title=Watch Omid Djalili in Moneysupermarket.com ad|date=30 December 2009|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then from 2011 to 2013 showed adverts such as man surfing on an inflatable crocodile, another man in a jungle with gorillas and another man going into space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/moneysupermarket-surf-mother/1078211|title=Moneysupermarket 'surf' by Mother|date=4 July 2011|publisher=Campaign Live|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013 a new advert was launched showing a man named Bill running around [[Croydon]] with an army of cats whilst a spokesman played by [[James Lance]] saying that Bill is so Moneysupermarket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/moneysupermarketcom-running-cats-mother/1194703|title=Moneysupermarket.com "running with cats" by Mother|date=12 August 2013|publisher=Campaign Live|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, a new advert was launched featuring [[Snoop Dogg]] and his song "[[What's My Name? (Snoop Doggy Dogg song)|Who Am I (What's My Name)]]" features on the ad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCd_J-4BauA|title=MoneySuperMarket Ad Featuring Snoop Dogg|date=3 March 2014|publisher=You Tube|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, another new advert was launched featuring the Epic Elephunk walks around the road of [[Manhattan]] city while Graeme is riding the Elephunk the Elephant's back, the narrator claiming he is so Money Supermarket, and the chosen soundtrack being "[[Word Up! (song)|Word Up!]]" by [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]] on this ad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/moneysupermarketcom-epic-elephunk-mother/1307234|title=Moneysupermarket.com "epic elephunk" by Mother|date=4 August 2014|publisher=Campaign Live|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, another advertising campaign was launched featuring a man named Dave (played by Michael Van Schoik), walking down a street in L.A, dressed in a shirt, suit jacket, denim hot pants and high heels. He alongside two other people, struts confidently to the song "[[Don't Cha]]" by the [[Pussycat Dolls]], while showing off his prominent rear to stunned onlookers, including [[Sharon Osbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/6274146/booty-man-dancing-moneysupermarket-advert-divides-opinion.html|title=Businessman's bizarre 'sexy' strut|publisher=The Sun|date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed by the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK to be the most complained about advert in 2015 with 1,513 complaints. In their ruling, the ASA found that whilst it may be distasteful to some, it did not judge the ad was offensive and the complaint was not upheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/News-resources/Media-Centre/2016/2015-most-complained-about-ads.aspx#.VxDHCpN94_U|title=2015's most complained about ads|date=23 February 2016|publisher=ASA|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, another advert was launched. It shows a chubby construction worker named Colin (played by Kyle McIntire). He dances, gryates, does a worm dance and a split in front of his co-workers and the bemused office staff at the other building. The song featured in this ad is "[[Just a Little (Liberty X song)|Just a Little]]" by British pop group [[Liberty X]]. At the end of the advert, he also swings on a wrecking ball (a reference to the video of Miley Cyrus' [[Wrecking Ball (Miley Cyrus song)|Wrecking Ball]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/moneysupermarket-follows-epic-strut-pole-dancing-builder/1357516|title=MoneySupermarket follows 'epic strut' with pole-dancing builder|date=24 July 2015|publisher=Campaign Live|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, another TV campaign by agency [[Mother (advertising agency)|Mother]] was launched featuring a bodyguard named Gary. The song featured in the ad is "[[Big Bad Wolf (Duck Sauce song)|Big Bad Wolf]]" by [[Duck Sauce]], an American-Canadian DJ duo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/moneysupermarketcom-epic-wolf-mother/1378494 | title = Moneysupermarket.com "epic wolf" by Mother  | date = 2016-07-01 | website = [[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]] | publisher = [[Haymarket Media Group]] | access-date = 2016-03-02 | quote = Moneysupermarket.com's follow-up to last year's popular "epic strut" and "Colin" ads features a presidential bodyguard popping and locking to Duck Sauce's Big Bad Wolf.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, another advert was released. It showed all three of the 'epic' people having a dance off in a car park. The song featured in the advert is "[[Worth It]]" by [[Fifth Harmony]] featuring [[Kid Ink]]. The ad premiered during the first break of ''[[Britains Got Talent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/04/09/the-new-money-supermarket-ad-has-debuted-and-it-features-a-bit-of-an-epic-dance-off-5806344/|title=The new Money Supermarket ad has debuted – and it features a bit of an epic dance off|date=9 April 2016|work=Metro|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; It was revealed in an article by [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] that in 2016 three of Moneysupermarket's adverts made the top 10 list of most complained about commercials in the United Kingdom, a list produced by the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]]. Despite the potential negativity, the company's new Chief Executive stated that he believed the 2,500 complaints showed their adverts had people talking about the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/10/08/moneysupermarket-ceo-pleased-twerking-adverts-talked-about/|title=Moneysupermarket CEO: I’m pleased our twerking adverts were talked about|last=Burton|first=Lucy|date=2017-10-08|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nasadiya Sukta''' (after the incipit ''{{IAST|ná ásat}}'', or "not the non-existent"), also known as the '''Hymn of Creation''', is the 129th hymn of the [[Mandala 10|10th mandala]] of the [[Rigveda]] (10:129). It is concerned with [[cosmology]] and the [[origin of the universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Human Being in Depth: A Scientific Approach to Religion|author=Swami Ranganathananda |authorlink=Ranganathananda |publisher=SUNY Press|year=1991|isbn=0-7914-0679-2 |page=21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0vfFZh9BIIC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=Big+Bang+theory+and+Indian+philosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k3jTkO6cxd&amp;sig=p6dqgaH8XiCUAoGz1MdupdGle2M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8dOXT5GfAYr5rQer7czJAQ&amp;ved=0CHAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Big%20Bang%20theory%20and%20Indian%20philosophy&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
{{Hinduism small}}
The hymn has attracted a large body of literature of commentaries both in Indian [[darshanas|darshan]] and in Western [[philology]].&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger says of this hymn (10.129) "This short hymn, though linguistically simple... is conceptually extremely provocative and has, indeed, provoked hundreds of complex commentaries among Indian theologians and Western scholars. In many ways, it is meant to puzzle and challenge, to raise unanswerable questions, to pile up paradoxes." ''The Rig Veda''. (Penguin Books: 1981) p. 25. {{ISBN|0-14-044989-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Creation Hymn begins by paradoxically stating "not the non-existent existed, nor did the existent exist then" (''{{IAST|ná ásat āsīt ná u  [[Sat (Sanskrit)|sát]] āsīt tadânīm}}''), paralleled  in verse 2 by "then not death existed, nor the immortal" (''{{IAST|ná mṛtyúḥ āsīt amŕtam ná tárhi}}''). But already in verse 2 mention is made that there was "breathing without breath, of its own nature, that one" ''{{IAST|ânīt avātám svadháyā tát [[ekam|ékam]]}}''). In verse 3, being unfolds, "from heat ([[tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]) was born that one" (''{{IAST|tápasaḥ tát mahinâ ajāyata ékam}}''). Verse 4 mentions desire ([[kāma]]) as the primal seed, and the first poet-seers ([[Rishi|kavayas]]) who "found the bond of being  within non-being with their heart's thought".

[[Karel Werner]] describes the author's source for the material as one not derived from reasoning, but a "visionary, mystical or Yogic experience put into words." Werner writes that prior to creation, the Creation Hymn does not describe a state of "nothingness" but rather "That One (''tad ekam'')" which is, "Spaceless, timeless, yet in its own way dynamic and the Sole Force, this Absolute..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Werner |first=Karel |last2= |first2= |date=1977 |title=Symbolism in the Vedas and Its Conceptualisation|url= |journal=[[Numen]] |publisher= |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=223–240 |doi=10.2307/3269600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brereton (1999) argues that the reference to the sages searching for being in their spirit is central, and that the hymn's gradual procession from non-being to being in fact re-enacts creation within the listener (see [[sphoṭa|{{IAST|sphoṭa}}]]), equating poetic utterance and creation (see [[śabda]]).

According to one source,&lt;ref&gt;"Although, no doubt, of high antiquity, the hymn appears to be less of a primary than of a secondary origin, being in fact a controversial composition levelled especially against the ''{{IAST|Sāṃkhya}}'' theory."  Ravi Prakash Arya and K. L. Joshi. ''{{IAST|Ṛgveda Saṃhitā}}: Sanskrit Text, English Translation, Notes &amp; Index of Verses''. (Parimal Publications: Delhi, 2001) {{Listed Invalid ISBN|81-7110-138-7}} (Set of four volumes). Parimal Sanskrit Series No. 45; 2003 reprint: 81-7020-070-9, Volume 4, p. 519.&lt;/ref&gt; the hymn is undoubtedly late within the Rigveda, and expresses thought more typical of later [[Indian philosophy]].

An atheist interpretation sees the Creation Hymn as one of the earliest accounts of [[skeptical inquiry]] and [[agnosticism]].&lt;ref name="patri"&gt;Patri, Umesh and Prativa Devi. "[http://www.positiveatheism.org/india/s1990a22.htm Progress of Atheism in India: A Historical Perspective] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qh9396tk?url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/india/s1990a22.htm |date=2014-06-29 }}". Atheist Centre 1940-1990 Golden Jubilee. Vijayawada, February 1990. Retrieved 2007-04-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] quoted it in discussing India's "tradition of skeptical questioning and unselfconscious humility before the great cosmic mysteries."&lt;ref name="Lecture"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHsC5xbz4Kk&amp;t=44m08s Carl Sagan, ''Carl Sagan's: Cosmos Part 10 - The Edge of Forever 44:08'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metre==
Nasadiya Sukta consists of seven [[trishtubh]]s, although pada 7b is defective, being two syllables short,
:''{{IAST|yádi vā dadhé yádi vā ná}}''
:"if he has created it; or if not [...]"
Brereton (1999) argues that the defect is a conscious device employed by the rishi to express puzzlement at the possibility that the world may ''not'' be created, parallel to the syntactic defect of pada 7d, which ends in a subordinate clause without a governing clause:
:''{{IAST|só aṅgá veda yádi vā ná véda}}''
:"he verily knows; or if he does not know [...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brereton |first=Joel |last2= |first2= |date=1999 |title=Edifying Puzzlement: {{IAST|Ṛgveda}} and the Uses of Enigma|url= |journal=[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]] |publisher= |volume=10 |issue=129 |pages= |doi= |access-date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It should be noted that Brereton's interpretation might be guided by the grammar rules applicable to the English language. The Sanskrit language does not follow the same rules.

Then even nothingness was not, nor existence,
There was no air then, nor the heavens beyond it.
What covered it? Where was it? In whose keeping?
Was there then cosmic water, in depths unfathomed?

Then there was neither death nor immortality
nor was there then the torch of night and day.
The One breathed windlessly and self-sustaining.
There was that One then, and there was no other.

At first there was only darkness wrapped in darkness.
All this was only unillumined cosmic water.
That One which came to be, enclosed in nothing,
arose at last, born of the power of heat.

In the beginning desire descended on it -
that was the primal seed, born of the mind.
The sages who have searched their hearts with wisdom
know that which is kin to that which is not.

And they have stretched their cord across the void,
and know what was above, and what below.
Seminal powers made fertile mighty forces.
Below was strength, and over it was impulse.

But, after all, who knows, and who can say
Whence it all came, and how creation happened?
the devas (gods) themselves are later than creation,
so who knows truly whence it has arisen?

Whence all creation had its origin,
the creator, whether she/he fashioned it or whether she/he did not,
the creator, who surveys it all from highest heaven,
she/he knows - or maybe even she/he does not know.&lt;ref name="Transaltion"&gt;[http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_pdf/naasadiiya.pdf Avinash Sathaye, ''Translation of Nasadiya Sukta'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Proof of insurance''' ('''POI''') is any type of documentation that a person can provide to another individual proving that the person has valid [[insurance]] with an [[insurance company]].

The most common form of a POI is a paper card provided by the insurance company listing policy information and effective dates.

Where [[vehicle insurance]] is compulsory, many states require that a person carry proof of insurance in their automobiles or on their person while driving.  If a person is questioned by a law enforcement official, they must provide proof of insurance.  A citation is generally issued if the person cannot provide such documentation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="875">In '''''R v Mkize''''', an important case in [[South African criminal law]], especially as it pertains to the defence of automatism, the accused was charged with the murder of his sister, whom he had stabbed to death. The court found, on a balance of probabilities, that he had suffered an attack known as "epileptic equivalent." He was therefore unconscious, without judgment or will or purpose or reasoning; the stabbing was a result of blind reflex activity. There was no intention to kill. The verdict, therefore, was "not guilty."

==Characters==

===Humans and Genies===
*Shimmer (voiced by [[Eva Bella]]) – An optimistic genie with blue eyes and pink hair. She is enthusiastic and encouraging. She loves cleaning, glitter, and collecting genie bottles. Her pet is a [[gibbon monkey]] named Tala.
*Shine (voiced by [[Isabella Cramp]]) – A courageous genie with purple eyes and blue hair. She is an animal lover and is often hungry. Her pet is a [[Bengal tiger]] cub named Nahal. Due to her love of animals, she is very knowledgeable about the behaviors of magical creatures native to Zahramay Falls. Unlike her sister, she hates cleaning. A running gag involves Shine saying "It's like I always say..." only to humorously reveal that she has just made up whatever she says next.
*Leah (voiced by [[Alina Foley]]) – A blonde girl with green eyes who owns a genie bottle necklace, which includes Shimmer and Shine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Sweetest Thing |minutes=3 |series=Shimmer and Shine |quote=Boom Zahramay! Your best friends are on the way.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Shimmer and Shine usually mess up her wishes, Leah is patient and forgiving with them. Originally, she was forced to keep her genies existence a secret from her close friend Zac, but revealed her secret to him after being transported to Zahramay Falls. In the second season, Princess Samira grants Leah and Zac's wish to visit Zahramay Falls whenever they want. While visiting her genies in Zahramay Falls, Leah magically dons a genie disguise in order to blend in, as humans are normally not allowed in Zahramay Falls.
*Zac (voiced by Blake Bertrand in the first two seasons, Justin Felbinger from season three and onward) – Leah's neighbor with red hair and blue eyes, and best human friend. In the first season, he is oblivious to the fact that Leah has genies. Whenever something strange or unusual happens, he responds to it in a carefree manner. He also has a habit of telling humorous experiences he has had to Leah. In the second season, he learns that Leah has genies and gets a genie of his own named Kaz.
*Princess Samira (voiced by [[Nikki SooHoo]]) – The ruler of Zahramay Falls with violet eyes and ice blue hair, who is in charge of checking up on all the genies in training. She can grant wishes along with the younger genies. She occasionally rewards genies with magic Genie Gems that can have a variety of magical effects. She acts as Shimmer and Shine's mentor and teacher. Despite Zeta being her self-proclaimed rival, Samira likes Zeta and is willing to give her a second chance at becoming a genie-in-training, which in season three is revealed to be due to her past friendship with Zeta when they were both students under Empress Caliana and hopes that Zeta and her can one day become friends again.
*Zeta the Sorceress (voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]]) – A resident of Zahramay Falls with green eyes and purple hair, who is Princess Samira's rival and wishes to replace her as the most powerful person in Zahramay Falls. Zeta is a sorceress instead of a genie, as she has no desire to grant the wishes of others, relying on magic potions and magical items. Her plans are almost always thwarted by Shimmer, Shine, and Leah. However, her own arrogance and ignorance can cause her to foil her own schemes as well. Despite the trouble she causes, the girls and Zac don't hold it against her and generally try to be friendly towards her when not foiling her schemes. Though she tends to be antagonistic towards Leah and her genies, she can be civil towards them at times and even work with them such when she finds herself and/or Nazboo in danger usually when her schemes backfire, which usually results in them saving her. Before becoming a sorceress, she was a genie-in-training under Empress Caliana along with Samira, whom Zeta befriended when she was a new student, though later quit school due to her jealousy of Samira and decided to become a sorceress instead, though despite her current rivalry with Samira is shown to cherish their past friendship as she held onto a feather pen Samira gave her when they first met along with a picture of the two of them together when they were both still friends.
*Kaz (voiced by [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]]) – A genie in training with blue eyes and magenta hair who becomes Zac's genie in the second season. In contrast to Zac's easy-going and adventurous personality, Kaz is more cautious and scared easily. Despite their contrasting personalities, Zac and Kaz work well together and can be brave when he has to be. His cautious nature also means he puts more thought into how he grants Zac's wishes. Like most genies in Zahramay Falls, he has his own magic carpet, though sometimes uses Zac's Super Zoom Flyer, a magic carpet wished up by Zac. Kaz has a pet Ziffilon named Zain, who summoned by one of Zac's wishes after he learned that Kaz always wanted a Ziffilon as a pet. Though he and Zac get along well, he occasionally becomes unenthusiastic when granting wishes for Zac he would prefer not too. He was initially afraid of Zac's dog Rocket due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though eventually overcame his fear after Zac and the girls reminded him of how other genies were initially scared of Zain before they got to know him.
*Empress Caliana (voiced by [[Barbara Eden]]) – Princess Samira's famous, semi-retired mentor with purple eyes and blonde hair. Caliana was the one who gave Samira her special necklace back when she was a little genie-in-training. Empress Caliana was a great explorer when she was a little girl and made many groundbreaking discoveries, such as finding the Caliana Caves. She is also old friends with Rohan, the normally shy crystalline golem that guards the caves. When Zeta and Samira were younger, Caliana taught genies-in-training at her school in Genie Hall, where Zeta was her top student. While praising Zeta's potion making skills, she tried to teach her to be more considerate of others and assigned Samira to sit next to Zeta when Samira was a new student which lead to Samira befriending Zeta, though Zeta eventually became jealous of Samira when she became the class's new top student, which eventually lead Zeta to quit school and decide to become a Sorceress instead after her attempt to sabotage Samira backfired, though Caliana expressed hope to Samira that she would one day return. 
*Captain Zora (voiced by [[Kellie Pickler]] from season two finale, [[Kate Higgins]] from season three and onward) – A pirate genie who is Shine's idol. She is absentminded at times and can be very clumsy and forgetful, especially when she is on an adventure. She owns a flying pirate ship that she sometimes accidentally docks in odd places. Shine loves pirate genies and Captain Zora is her favorite of them all, so she gets very nervous and sometimes cannot talk clearly when she is around Zora.
*Layla (voiced by [[Danica McKellar]]) – An ice genie who is a good friend of Princess Samira. She possesses an ice gem necklace that gives her freezing powers and keeps her body cold. She originally lived in a genie bottle buried on a sandy beach in Zahramay Falls, but it was accidentally broken by Leah and her genies. She currently lives in an ice palace.
*Shaya (voiced by Kin Santiago) – A lightning genie in training who rides around on a flying cloud-board and can generate magical lightning. Leah and her genies help him catch a run away magic lightning bolt he created while practicing his magic. Though he is reluctant to work with Leah and her genies at first, he eventually learns the value of teamwork from them.
*Nila (voiced by Mila Brener) – A mermaid who lives in the waters near Zahramay Falls. Leah and her genies befriend Nila after Leah wishes to find a Mermaid after learning they are real. She helps the girls obtain the Mermaid Gem to change the girls back to their non-mermaid selves after Leah accidentally uses up her wishes which leaves the girls trapped in Mermaid form. After Nila and the girls obtain the gem by befriending its lonely Guardian, she teaches them the spell to activate the gem's power which can both transform into Mermaids as well as undo the transformation allowing the girls to visit Nila and go on underwater adventures with her. 
*Imma  (voiced by Grace Kaufman) – The Waterfall Genie who oversees the source of the rainbow waterfalls of Zahramay Falls in Rainbow Zahramay. The girls befriend her after Samira sends them on their first adventure to Rainbow Zahramay to investigate the cause of a weird mist produced by the falls that disrupts magic in Zahramay Falls and help Imma resolve the problem. Imma can use water magic that allows her to manipulate water using her magic staff which she also uses to activate the locks that control the flow of rainbow water to the falls.
* Wishy Washy Genie (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) - A male genie whose powerful magic is to remove or fix a wish that cannot be used on other genies. He can be very wishy washy, just like his name. But while on the their adventure to find his home, the children help him make decisions.
*Ayla (voiced by [[Liliana Mumy]]) – A hair-changing genie who has the power to change hairstyles.
*Minu (voiced by Kitana Turnbull) – A flitter genie.
*Nadia (voiced by Brittany Snow) - The dream genie who is the only genie capable of granting wishes involving dreams and specializes in dream magic which involve using magic dust. She is also in charge of crafting special dreams for everyone in Zahramay Falls. As a result, she knows about everyone in Zahramay Falls. However it is rare for her to make dreams actually come true. 
*Ezri (voiced by Gunnar Sizemore) - Nadia's assistant who like Nadia knows about everybody in Zahramay Falls as he recognizes Leah, Shimmer, Shine, and even Zeta on first meeting them.

===Animals===
All animals in the series are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].
*Tala – Shimmer's pet [[gibbon monkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/tala/41pirj|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707235316/http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/tala/41pirj|archivedate=July 7, 2017|title=Tala from Shimmer and Shine – Nick Asia|work=[[Nickelodeon (Southeast Asia)|Nickelodeon Southeast Asia]]|publisher=[[Viacom International|Viacom International, Inc.]]|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has green eyes and wears white pearls, like Shimmer does.

*Nahal – Shine's white [[Bengal tiger]] cub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/nahal/tynsbg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707235134/http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/nahal/tynsbg|archivedate=July 7, 2017|title=Nahal from Shimmer and Shine – Nick Asia|work=[[Nickelodeon (Southeast Asia)|Nickelodeon Southeast Asia]]|publisher=[[Viacom International|Viacom International, Inc.]]|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wears pink jewels and a gold circlet, like Shine does. She has a talent for playing the keyboard.
*Rocket – Zac's pet dog who appears in several episodes of the first season and reappears in the third season. He is a rambunctious dog with a tendency to drool and chew on things which often causes trouble, though is simply an overly playful pouch who means no real harm. He has encountered Shimmer, Shine, Tala, and Nahal at various times. The only pet native to Leah and Zac's world, he eventually is wished to Zahramay Falls by Zac though is mistakenly seen as a monster by genies like Kaz and animals native to genie world like Parisa and Zain who are unfamiliar with dogs at first due to dogs not being native to their world, with the exception of Shimmer, Shine, Tala, Nahal, and Samira. After helping Zac stop Zeta from stealing Samira's staff, Samira permits Rocket to accompany Zac when he visits Zahramay Falls. 
*Nazboo – Zeta's talking pet dragon, who caters to her every need and acts as Zeta's underling. He is somewhat clumsy and often accidentally causes Zeta's schemes to backfire. He can also get easily distracted by food or anything that piques his interest. He also enjoys getting an occasional tummy rubs from Zeta. Though he acts as Zeta's underling most of the time, he is friendly towards Leah, Zac, and their genies as well as their pets to the point he often greets them by saying "''Hi, Friends!''" even in the middle of one of Zeta's schemes. Unlike Zeta, he is generally more considerate of others and prefers to play fair in competitions though usually assists Zeta in cheating. In the third season, he is revealed to be from Manetikar, The Land of Dragons and befriended Zeta when she came to Manetikar to find a dragon for a pet. Feeling sorry for Zeta after her attempt to make one of the larger flying dragons her pet failed, he agreed to become her pet and went home with her to her lair in Zahramay Falls, where he has lived ever since. He has a sister and two brothers who resemble him in appearance and personality.
*Roya – Princess Samira's pet peacock, who resides in her palace. Roya is the polar opposite of Shimmer and Shine's pets, as she would much rather show off her feathers or practice walking gracefully than play or dance. Unlike Samira, Roya has a strong dislike for Zeta and Nazboo, to the point of literally chasing them out of Samira's Palace on one occasion. Once a year, she sheds a special feather with the ability to repair any magical object. 
*Parisa – Leah's pet Zahramay fox who possesses the ability to camouflage herself, making her practically invisible, whenever she wants. she also has a talent for painting. Parisa is introduced midway through the second season. Like Kaz and Zain, she was initially scared of Rocket, due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though not to the same degree that Kaz and Zain were.
*Zain – Kaz's pet Ziffilon (a griffin-like creature). Kaz had always wanted a pet Ziffilon before getting Zain, so Zac uses one of his wishes to wish up a Ziffilon for Kaz. Zain is by far the largest of the pets, as he is big enough for Kaz to ride on his back, though despite his size Zain gets scared easily even more so than Kaz. Like most Ziffilons his favorite food is Zlam Berries and is originally from Ziffilon Island. Though he gets along with the other pets, he is frightened by Rocket at first due to being unfamiliar with dogs though after Zac reminds Kaz and Zain how other genies were scared of Zain at first, he and Kaz manage to overcome their initial fear of Rocket. 
*Zoomicorns – Winged Unicorns native to Zahramay Falls and Rainbow Zahramay introduced in the second season. They are friendly and helpful creatures who occasionally aid the girls and allow them to ride them. There is also a game called Zoomicorn Toss, where players ride flying Zahramay Cloud Boards while trying to throw rings around a Zoomicorn's horn as it flies around, without the use of magic as using magic is considered unfair. The only known named Zoomicorn, is Gleam who lives in Rainbow Zahramay that is a friend of the Glitter Genie Afina whom the girls meet and befriend during one of their adventures in Rainbow Zahramay in the third season. 
*Scallywag – The magical pet of the Pirate Genie Captain Zora, who helps Zora remember things that she forgets such as names and the meaning if words and phrases used by pirates. Scallywag flies around by spinning her tail in helicopter like fashion. Her magic goes out of control when scared causing random magic effects. 
*Nazboo's Family – Nazboo's three siblings Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank who are introduced in the third season. They all small flightless dragons that resemble Nazboo in appearance and share his friendly playful nature as well as his love of food and tummy rubs, though Nazboo and his siblings tend to get into trouble when they are together much to Zeta's frustration and annoyance, when they come to visit Nazboo. His sister Razboo has purple scales and wears a bow on her head. His brother Kazboo has green scales and a mohawk, while his brother Frank has blue scales and wears a bowtie. While Kazboo and Razboo are capable of speech like Nazboo, Frank's vocabulary is apparently limit to saying his own name which doesn't rhyme with his other siblings' names.

The '''''Vân đài loại ngữ''''' ({{vi-nom|芸臺類語}}) is a 1773 [[Chinese-language literature of Vietnam|Chinese-language]] encyclopedia compiled by the Vietnamese scholar [[Lê Quý Đôn]]. Its title is variously translated into English as ''Categorized Sayings from the Van Terrace'' or ''Classified discourse from the library''.&lt;ref&gt;Sources of Vietnamese Tradition George Edson Dutton, George E. Dutton, Jayne Susan Werner - 2012- p603 "Categorized Sayings from the Van Terrace (Van dai loai ngu; Le Quy Don), pp170–74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Kelly, Anthony Reid -Asian Freedoms: The Idea of Freedom in East and Southeast Asia -1998 p223 "Le Quy Don, Van dai loai ngu [Classified discourse from the library], cf. 1773 work (Hanoi: Nhaxuat ban van hoa, 1961), vol. l,p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was heavily influenced by [[Song Dynasty]] [[Confucianism]].&lt;ref&gt;黃俊傑 ''中華文化與域外文化的互動與融合'' Volume 1 - 2006 Page 480 "黎貴悖深受宋儒特別是朱熹的影婪。他在(芸台類語)中抄錄二朱莒關於理、氣的論述.說:天地之間有理有氣。理也者.形而上之逍也.生物之本也。氣也者.形而下之器也.生物之具也。是也人物之生.必某此理.然後有性;必某此戎.然後有形。 天下未有無理之杖."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{tone|section|date=August 2015}}
There's a gang war going on, but that won't stop the inexperienced but eager wannabe film crew The Fuck Bombers from following their dreams of making the ultimate action epic. Ten years ago, yakuza mid-boss Ikegami led an assault against rival don Muto. Now, on the eve of his revenge, all Muto wants to do is complete his masterpiece, a feature film with his daughter in the starring role, before his wife is released from prison. And The Fuck Bombers are standing by with the chance of a lifetime: to film a real, live yakuza battle to the death on 35mm.
