'''''Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans''''' (previously ''Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans'') is a [[Gram-negative]], facultative anaerobe, non-motile bacterium that is often found in association with [[localized aggressive periodontitis]], a severe infection of the [[periodontium]]. It is also suspected to be involved in [[chronic periodontitis]].&lt;ref name=Henderson2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Henderson B, Ward JM, Ready D | title = Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans: a triple A* periodontopathogen? | journal = Periodontology 2000 | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 78–105 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20712635 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0757.2009.00331.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Less frequently, ''A. actinomycetemcomitans'' is associated with non-oral infections such as endocarditis. Its role in aggressive [[periodontitis]] was first discovered by [[Denmark|Danish]]-born [[periodontist]] [[Jørgen Slots]], a professor of [[dentistry]] and [[microbiology]] at the [[University of Southern California School of Dentistry]].

'Bacterium actinomycetem comitans' was first described by Klinger (1912) as coccobacillary bacteria isolated together with ''Actinomyces'' from actinomycotic lesions in humans. It was reclassified as ''Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans'' by Topley &amp; Wilson (1929) and as ''Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans'' by Potts ''et al.'' (1985). The species has attracted attention because of its association with localized aggressive periodontitis.&lt;ref name="pmid16957111"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nørskov-Lauritsen N, Kilian M | title = Reclassification of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus paraphrophilus and Haemophilus segnis as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans gen. nov., comb. nov., Aggregatibacter aphrophilus comb. nov. and Aggregatibacter segnis comb. nov., and emended description of Aggregatibacter aphrophilus to include V factor-dependent and V factor-independent isolates | journal = International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology | volume = 56 | issue = Pt 9 | pages = 2135–46 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16957111 | doi = 10.1099/ijs.0.64207-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==
Recent studies have shown a phylogenetic similarity of ''A. actinomycetemcomitans'' and ''Haemophilus aphrophilus'', ''H. paraphrophilus'', and ''H. segnis'', suggesting the new [[genus]] ''Aggregatibacter'' for them.&lt;ref name="pmid16957111" /&gt;

== Importance ==
It is one of the [[bacteria]] that might be implicated in destructive [[periodontal disease]]. Although it has been found more frequently in localized aggressive periodontitis,&lt;ref name="pmid1061986"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Slots J | title = The predominant cultivable organisms in juvenile periodontitis | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Dental Research | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–10 | date = January 1976 | pmid = 1061986 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0722.1976.tb00454.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; prevalence in any population is rather high. It has also been isolated from actinomycotic lesions (mixed infection with certain ''Actinomyces'' species, in particular ''A. israelii''). It possesses certain [[virulence]] factors that enable it to invade tissues, such as the pore-forming toxin leukotoxin A (LtxA). It has also been isolated from women with [[bacterial vaginosis]] and as an etiologic agent in endocarditis.&lt;ref name="AfricaNel2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Africa CW, Nel J, Stemmet M | title = Anaerobes and bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy: virulence factors contributing to vaginal colonisation | journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 6979–7000 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25014248 | pmc = 4113856 | doi = 10.3390/ijerph110706979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pore-forming toxin LtxA of ''A. actinomycetemcomitans'' may be a trigger of the autoimmune disease [[rheumatoid arthritis]] due to its ability to stimulate protein [[citrullination]], a post-translational protein modification targeted by autoantibodies in this disease.&lt;ref name=Konig2016&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konig MF, Abusleme L, Reinholdt J, Palmer RJ, Teles RP, Sampson K, Rosen A, Nigrovic PA, Sokolove J, Giles JT, Moutsopoulos NM, Andrade F | title = Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced hypercitrullination links periodontal infection to autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Science Translational Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 369 | pages = 369ra176 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27974664 | pmc = 5384717 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaj1921 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abbasi J | title = To Prevent Rheumatoid Arthritis, Look Past the Joints to the Gums | journal = JAMA | volume = 317 | issue = 12 | pages = 1201–1202 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28273301 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2017.0764 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Virulence factors ==
*Leukotoxin A (LtxA); kills [[Granulocyte|PMNs]], [[monocytes]], and other leukocytes expressing [[Cd18|integrin beta-2 (CD18)]]
*[[Cytolethal distending toxin]]
*Immunosuppression factors that inhibit blastogenesis, [[antibody]] production, and activate T-suppressor cells
*Inhibition of [[Granulocyte|PMN]] functions
*Resistant to [[complement system|complement]]-mediated killing
*Lipopolysaccharides
*Surface antigens
*Heat shock proteins
*Antimicrobial resistance

== ''A. actinomycetemcomitans'' serotypes ==
*a strain, for example ATCC 29523, frequently in oral cavity, variable leukotoxin expression
*b strain Y4, most frequently in localized aggressive periodontitis, high leukotoxin expression
*c strain ATCC 33384, low leukotoxin expression
*serotypes d, e, f, g
*within each serotype, leukotoxin expression can be highly variable between strains

== Small RNA ==
In bacteria [[Bacterial small RNA|small RNA]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are involved in gene regulation. Jorth et al. identified 9 sRNA by Northern blotting from computer predicted candidates in strain VT1169 and 202 sRNA by RNA seq in strain 624.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jorth P, Whiteley M | title = Characterization of a novel riboswitch-regulated lysine transporter in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 192 | issue = 23 | pages = 6240–50 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20889741 | pmc = 2981213 | doi = 10.1128/JB.00935-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jorth P, Trivedi U, Rumbaugh K, Whiteley M | title = Probing bacterial metabolism during infection using high-resolution transcriptomics | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 195 | issue = 22 | pages = 4991–8 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23974023 | pmc = 3811578 | doi = 10.1128/JB.00875-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic screen by RNA-seq and RT-PCR in HK1651 strain (a clinical isolate from an aggressive  periodontitis patient), quantified 70 sRNAs and further identified 17 differentially expressed sRNAs during growth phases.&lt;ref name="Oogai_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oogai Y, Gotoh Y, Ogura Y, Kawada-Matsuo M, Hayashi T, Komatsuzawa H | title = Small RNA repertoires and their intraspecies variation in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans | journal = DNA Research | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29211829 | pmc = 5909427 | doi = 10.1093/dnares/dsx050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Target prediction indicated possibility of sRNA interaction with several virulence genes. &lt;ref name="Oogai_2017" /&gt; This study confirmed the presence of one of previously identified Fur regulated [[Aggregatibacter iron-regulated sRNA|sRNAs JA04]] identified in strain HK1651.

'''Alison Murray''' is an American biochemist and [[Antarctic]] researcher, best known for her work demonstrating the existence of microbial life within an ice-sealed Antarctic lake (Lake Vida).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She studies how microorganisms persist and function in extremely cold and harsh environments, including those that lack oxygen and biological sources of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Microbes Found Living Beneath the Icy Surface of Antarctic Lake |url=https://www.dri.edu/newsroom/news-releases/4192-ancient-microbes-found-living-beneath-the-icy-surface-of-antarctic-lake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Murray was born and raised in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel, California]] and attended [[Carmel High School (Carmel, California)|Carmel High School]]. She received her B.S. in Biochemistry at [[California Polytechnic State University]], San Luis Obispo in 1989,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unr.edu/molecular-biosciences/faculty/alison-murray|title=Alison Murray|website=www.unr.edu|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by participation in a work-study program that turned into a Research Assistant position at the [[Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences|Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science]] (formerly, Bermuda Biological Station).

Following two years of work experience she joined the Biogeochemical Reactions in Estuaries - Land Margin Ecosystem Research Program at [[Tomales Bay]], earned her M.S. degree at [[San Francisco State University]] in Cell and Molecular Biology in 1994&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; where she studied with James T. Hollibaugh to develop  molecular fingerprinting approaches for marine microorganisms.

Murray's Ph.D. was earned in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology under the mentorship of [[Edward DeLong|Edward F. DeLong]], from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was during this time that she participated in two research expeditions to the Antarctic where she studied the ecology of planktonic marine Archaea ([[Crenarchaeota]]) with circumpolar distributions and demonstrated significant shifts in bacterial community composition and archaeal biomass over the extremes of the high latitude seasonal cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=A.

==Career and impact ==
Murray's postdoctoral research (1999-2001) was conducted at the Center for Microbial Ecology at [[Michigan State University]] in which she studied in the emerging field of functional genomics with Distinguished Professor [[James Tiedje|James M. Tiedje]]. She then moved to [[Desert Research Institute]] (DRI) in Reno, Nevada, USA in 2001 where she is a research professor.

Murray is best known for her work discovering the existence of microbial life at −13&amp;nbsp;°C existing within an ice-sealed the Antarctic Lake Vida,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Alison E.|last2=Kenig|first2=Fabien|last3=Fritsen|first3=Christian H.|last4=McKay|first4=Christopher P.|last5=Cawley|first5=Kaelin M.|last6=Edwards|first6=Ross|last7=Kuhn|first7=Emanuele|last8=McKnight|first8=Diane M.|last9=Ostrom|first9=Nathaniel E.|date=2012-12-11|title=Microbial life at −13 °C in the brine of an ice-sealed Antarctic lake|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/50/20626|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=109|issue=50|pages=20626–20631|doi=10.1073/pnas.1208607109|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3528574|pmid=23185006|bibcode=2012PNAS..10920626M}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest of several unique lakes found in the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]].

Her research has shown how microbes respond to different environmental gradients and how they contribute and control fundamental ecological processes resulting in a better understanding of how high latitude ecosystems function and how they might respond to broad scale perturbations such as climate change.

{{nihongo|'''Bandō Mitsugorō VIII'''|八代目 坂東 三津五郎|Hachidaime Bandō Mitsugorō}}&lt;ref name=name&gt;Bandō's name, being a stage name, is rendered in traditional order, not Western name order.&lt;/ref&gt; (19 October 1906 – 16 January 1975) was one of [[Japan]]'s most revered [[Kabuki]] actors from the 1930s until his death. He was a renowned ''[[tachiyaku]]'' and ''[[katakiyaku]]'', specializing in particular in the ''[[aragoto]]'' style. He was officially designated as a "[[Living National Treasure (Japan)|Living National Treasure]]" by the Japanese government in 1973.

==Lineage==
Eighth in the line of [[Bandō Mitsugorō]], he was adopted by [[Bandō Mitsugorō VII]]; his son and grandson would go on to take the name as well, becoming ninth and tenth in the line respectively.

==Early life==
Bandō made his stage debut at the age of 7, in 1913, as Bandō Yososuke III. He would take the name Minosuke VI in 1928, at the [[Meiji-za]] theatre.

==Career==
He later tried to adapt [[The Tale of Genji]] to the stage, but was prohibited from doing so by the authorities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} After a few years in a kabuki troupe run by the [[Toho]] company, he moved to [[Kansai]]; he lived there for nearly 20 years, performing in [[Osaka]] and other venues, and taking part in the final performances at the [[Ōsaka Kabuki-za]], which closed and became a department store in 1958.

In 1962, following his return to [[Tokyo]], and the death of his adopted father [[Bandō Mitsugorō VII]], Bandō celebrated a ''[[shūmei]]'' (naming ceremony) alongside his son-in-law, [[Bandō Mitsugorō IX]] and grandson [[Bandō Mitsugorō X]]. He took the name Mitsugorō VIII. Four years later, he performed at the opening ceremonies for Tokyo's [[National Theater (Tokyo)|National Theater]].

He performed as Kakogawa Honzō in ''[[Kanadehon Chūshingura]]'' (the Tale of the 47 Ronin) in December 1974, at the National Theater. This was among his final performances, as he died the following month at age 68.

==Death==
In January 1975, Bandō visited a [[Kyoto]] restaurant with friends and ordered four portions of ''fugu kimo'', the liver of the [[fugu]] fish, a dish whose sale was prohibited by local ordinances at the time.&lt;ref name="leaderpost"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kvRUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3DwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4571,837806&amp;hl=en | title=Japanese Actor Poisoned | work=The Leader-Post | date=20 January 1975 | accessdate=19 August 2013 | author=Roderick, John | pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming that he could survive the fish's poison, he ate the livers and died&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Whatever Doesn’t Kill Some Animals Can Make Them Deadly  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/science/22creature.html |quote=In 1975, the Kabuki actor Bando Mitsugoro VIII ordered four fugu kimo in a restaurant in Kyoto, claiming he could resist the poison.

'''Biobank Central''' is a web-based portal dedicated to advancing the use of human biological materials for research, in order to accelerate the development of new medical therapies and cures. A [[biobank]] is a repository that stores biological samples like DNA, tissue, blood, and blood serum. Biobank Central aims to spread public awareness about the critical role of biobanks in research and development, increase the amount of biological data available to researchers, and encourage sharing data among different biobanks around the world. The website provides up-to-date news about biorepositories, offers patient and public education programs, and hosts an open forum for international collaboration.

Biobank Central was launched by FasterCures on April 19, 2006, and in its first year of operation was sponsored by [[IBM Healthcare and Life Sciences]], [[Affymetrix]], [[Bioaccelerate Holdings Inc.]], and [[Invitrogen Corporation]].

The '''body mass index''' ('''BMI''') or '''Quetelet index''' is a value derived from the [[mass]] ([[Mass versus weight|weight]]) and [[height]] of an individual. The BMI is defined as the [[human body weight|body mass]] divided by the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[human height|body height]], and is universally expressed in [[Units of measurement|units]] of kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting from mass in [[kilogram]]s and height in [[metre]]s.

The BMI may also be determined using a table&lt;ref group=note&gt;e.g., the [http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/bmi_tbl.htm Body Mass Index Table] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310114919/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/bmi_tbl.htm |date=2010-03-10 }} from the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|NHLBI]].&lt;/ref&gt; or chart which displays BMI as a function of mass and height using contour lines or colours for different BMI categories, and which may use other units of measurement (converted to metric units for the calculation).&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, in the UK where people often know their weight in [[Stone (unit)|stone]] and height in feet and inches, – see {{cite web |url=http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42028000/gif/_42028890_bmi_gra_416x314.gif |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-29 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111002050/http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42028000/gif/_42028890_bmi_gra_416x314.gif |archive-date=2012-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BMI is an attempt to quantify the amount of tissue mass ([[muscle]], fat, and bone) in an individual, and then categorize that person as ''underweight'', ''normal weight'', ''overweight'', or ''obese'' based on that value. That categorization is the subject of some debate about where on the BMI scale the dividing lines between categories should be placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/why-being-overweight-means-you-live-longer-the-way-scientists-twist-the-facts-10158229.html |title=Why being 'overweight' means you live longer: The way scientists twist the facts |author=Malcolm Kendrick |publisher=[[The Independent (newspaper)|https://www.independent.co.uk]] |date=April 12, 2015 |access-date=12 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412201212/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/why-being-overweight-means-you-live-longer-the-way-scientists-twist-the-facts-10158229.html |archive-date=12 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight: under 18.5&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, normal weight: 18.5 to 25, overweight: 25 to 30, obese: over 30. People of Asian descent have different associations between BMI, percentage of body fat, and health risks than those of European descent, with a higher risk of [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]] and [[Atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] cardiovascular disease at BMIs lower than the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] cut-off point for overweight, 25&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, although the cut-off for observed risk varies among different Asian populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Appropriate body-mass index for Asian populations and its implications for policy and intervention strategies | journal = Lancet | volume = 363 | issue = 9403 | pages = 157–63 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14726171 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)15268-3 }}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolphe Quetelet]], a Belgian astronomer, mathematician, statistician and sociologist, devised the basis of the BMI between 1830 and 1850 as he developed what he called "social physics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eknoyan G | title = Adolphe Quetelet (1796-1874)--the average man and indices of obesity | journal = Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–51 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17890752 | doi = 10.1093/ndt/gfm517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern term "body mass index" (BMI) for the ratio of [[human body weight]] to squared height was coined in a paper published in the July 1972 edition of the ''[[Journal of Chronic Diseases]]'' by [[Ancel Keys]] and others. In this paper, Keys argued that what he termed the BMI was "...if not fully satisfactory, at least as good as any other relative weight index as an indicator of relative obesity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blackburn H, Jacobs D | title = Commentary: Origins and evolution of body mass index (BMI): continuing saga | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pages = 665–9 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24691955 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyu061 | url = https://academic.oup.com/ije/article-pdf/43/3/665/9728399/dyu061.pdf | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2223095/ |title= Beyond BMI: Why doctors won't stop using an outdated measure for obesity |author= Jeremy Singer-Vine |publisher= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]] |date= July 20, 2009 |access-date= 15 December 2013 |deadurl= no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110907125413/http://www.slate.com/id/2223095 |archive-date= 7 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keys A, Fidanza F, Karvonen MJ, Kimura N, Taylor HL | title = Indices of relative weight and obesity | journal = Journal of Chronic Diseases | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 329–43 | date = July 1972 | pmid = 4650929 | doi = 10.1016/0021-9681(72)90027-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interest in an index that measures [[body fat]] came with observed increasing obesity in prosperous [[Western world|Western]] societies. Keys explicitly judged BMI as appropriate for ''population'' studies and inappropriate for individual evaluation. Nevertheless, due to its simplicity, it has come to be widely used for preliminary diagnoses.&lt;ref name=nhlbi&gt;{{cite web|title= Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk|url= http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/risk.htm|publisher= National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute|access-date= 19 December 2014|deadurl= no|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141219195703/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/risk.htm|archive-date=19 December 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional metrics, such as waist circumference, can be more useful.&lt;ref name=nhsob&gt;{{cite web|title= Defining obesity|url= http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Obesity/Pages/Introduction.aspx|publisher= [[National Health Service|NHS]]|access-date= 19 December 2014|deadurl= no|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141218121754/http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Obesity/Pages/Introduction.aspx|archive-date= 18 December 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BMI is universally expressed in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres. If pounds and inches are used, a conversion factor of 703&amp;nbsp;(kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/(lb/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) must be applied. When the term BMI is used informally, the units are usually omitted.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BMI} = \frac{\text{mass}_\text{kg}}{\text{height}_\text{m}^2}
= \frac{\text{mass}_\text{lb}}{\text{height}_\text{in}^2}\times 703&lt;/math&gt;

BMI provides a simple numeric measure of a person's ''thickness'' or ''thinness'', allowing health professionals to discuss weight problems more objectively with their patients. BMI was designed to be used as a simple means of classifying average sedentary (physically inactive)  populations, with an average [[body composition]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
For such individuals, the value recommendations {{as of | 2014 | lc = on}} are as follows: a BMI from 18.5 up to 25&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; may indicate optimal weight, a BMI lower than 18.5 suggests the person is [[underweight]], a number from 25 up to 30 may indicate the person is [[overweight]], and a number from 30 upwards suggests the person is [[obesity|obese]].&lt;ref name=nhlbi /&gt;&lt;ref name=nhsob /&gt; Lean athletes often have a high muscle-to-fat ratio and therefore a BMI that is misleadingly high relative to their body-fat percentage.&lt;ref name=nhsob /&gt;

==Scalability==
BMI is proportional to the mass and inversely proportional to the square of the height. So, if all body dimensions double, and mass scales naturally with the cube of the height, then BMI doubles instead of remaining the same. This results in taller people having a reported BMI that is uncharacteristically high, compared to their actual body fat levels. In comparison, the [[Ponderal index]] is based on the natural scaling of mass with the third power of the height.

However, many taller people are not just "scaled up" short people but tend to have narrower frames in proportion to their height. Carl Lavie has written that, "The B.M.I. tables are excellent for identifying obesity and body fat in large populations, but they are far less reliable for determining fatness in individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/health/31brod.html|title=Weight Index Doesn&amp;#8217;t Tell the Whole Truth|date=31 August 2010|work=The New York Times|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501153306/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/health/31brod.html|archive-date=1 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
A frequent use of the BMI is to assess how much an individual's body weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person's height. The weight excess or deficiency may, in part, be accounted for by body fat ([[adipose tissue]]) although other factors such as muscularity also affect BMI significantly (see discussion below and [[overweight]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html|title=About Adult BMI  {{!}} Healthy Weight {{!}} CDC|date=2017-08-29|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] regards a BMI of less than 18.5 as underweight and may indicate [[malnutrition]], an [[eating disorder]], or other health problems, while a BMI equal to or greater than 25 is considered overweight and above 30 is considered [[obesity|obese]].&lt;ref name="BMI Classification"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/bmi/index.jsp?introPage=intro_3.html |title=BMI Classification |work=Global Database on Body Mass Index |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2006 |access-date=July 27, 2012 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418181049/http://www.who.int/bmi/index.jsp?introPage=intro_3.html |archive-date=April 18, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These ranges of BMI values are valid only as statistical categories.

===BMI in children (aged 2 to 20)===
[[File:BMIBoys 1.svg|thumb|BMI for age percentiles for boys 2 to 20 years of age.]]
[[File:BMIGirls 1.svg|thumb|BMI for age percentiles for girls 2 to 20 years of age.]]
BMI is used differently for [[child]]ren. It is calculated in the same way as for adults, but then compared to typical values for other children of the same age. Instead of comparison against fixed thresholds for underweight and overweight, the BMI is compared against the [[percentile]] for children of the same sex and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_BMI/about_childrens_BMI.htm|title = Body Mass Index: BMI for Children and Teens|publisher = Center for Disease Control|access-date = 2013-12-16|deadurl = no|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029061522/http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_BMI/about_childrens_BMI.htm|archive-date = 2013-10-29|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A BMI that is less than the 5th percentile is considered underweight and above the 95th percentile is considered obese. Children with a BMI between the 85th and 95th percentile are considered to be overweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Chapter 2: Use of Percentiles and Z-Scores in Anthropometry | title = Handbook of Anthropometry|last=Wang|first=Youfa| name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4419-1787-4|location=New York|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies in Britain have indicated that females between the ages 12 and 16 have a higher BMI than males of the same age by 1.0&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/deps/doh/survey02/summ03.htm|title = Health Survey for England: The Health of Children and Young People|website = Archive2.official-documents.co.uk|access-date = 16 December 2013|deadurl = yes|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120625003857/http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/deps/doh/survey02/summ03.htm#|archive-date = 2012-06-25|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Singapore====
In Singapore, the BMI cut-off figures were revised in 2005, motivated by studies showing that many Asian populations, including Singaporeans, have higher proportion of body fat and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases and [[diabetes mellitus]], compared with Caucasians at the same BMI. The BMI cut-offs are presented with an emphasis on health risk rather than weight.

====United States====
In 1998, the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] brought U.S. definitions in line with [[World Health Organization]] guidelines, lowering the normal/overweight cut-off from BMI 27.8 to BMI 25. This had the effect of redefining approximately 29 million Americans, previously ''healthy'', to ''overweight''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9806/17/weight.guidelines/ | title=Who's fat? New definition adopted | publisher=CNN | date=June 17, 1998 | access-date=2010-04-26 | deadurl=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122173108/http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9806/17/weight.guidelines/ | archive-date=November 22, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can partially explain the increase in the ''overweight'' diagnosis in the past 20 years, and the increase in sales of weight loss products during the same time. [[World Health Organization|WHO]] also recommends lowering the normal/overweight threshold for South East Asian body types to around BMI 23, and expects further revisions to emerge from clinical studies of different body types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=World Health Organization|first=|date=January 10, 2004|title=Appropriate body-mass index for Asian populations and its implications for policy and intervention strategies|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/bmi_asia_strategies.pdf|journal=The Lancet|volume=363|pages=|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(03)15268-3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 1994 showed that 59.8% of American men and 51.2% of women had BMIs over 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/databriefs/adultweight.pdf|title=Healthy weight, overweight, and obesity among U.S. adults|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513072652/http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/databriefs/adultweight.pdf|archive-date=2016-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morbid obesity—a BMI of 40 or more—was found in 2% of the men and 4% of the women. A survey in 2007 showed 63% of Americans are overweight or obese, with 26% in the obese category (a BMI of 30 or more). {{as of|2014}}, 37.7% of adults in the United States were obese, categorized as 35.0% of men and 40.4% of women; class 3 obesity (BMI over 40) values were 7.7% for men and 9.9% for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flegal KM, Kruszon-Moran D, Carroll MD, Fryar CD, Ogden CL | title = Trends in Obesity Among Adults in the United States, 2005 to 2014 | journal = JAMA | volume = 315 | issue = 21 | pages = 2284–91 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27272580 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2016.6458 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Public health===
The BMI is generally used as a means of correlation between groups related by general mass and can serve as a vague means of estimating [[adipose tissue|adiposity]]. The duality of the BMI is that, while it is easy to use as a general calculation, it is limited as to how accurate and pertinent the data obtained from it can be. Generally, the index is suitable for recognizing trends within sedentary or overweight individuals because there is a smaller margin of error.&lt;ref name="jxbvhf"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jeukendrup |first1=A. |authorlink1=Asker Jeukendrup |last2=Gleeson |first2=M. | name-list-format = vanc |year=2005 |title=Sports Nutrition |publisher=Human Kinetics: An Introduction to Energy Production and Performance |isbn=978-0-7360-3404-3}}{{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BMI has been used by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] as the standard for recording obesity statistics since the early 1980s.

This general correlation is particularly useful for consensus data regarding obesity or various other conditions because it can be used to build a semi-accurate representation from which a solution can be stipulated, or the [[Recommended Dietary Allowance|RDA]] for a group can be calculated. Similarly, this is becoming more and more pertinent to the growth of children, due to the fact that the majority of children are sedentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barasi |first=M. E. | name-list-format = vanc |year=2004 |title=Human Nutrition – a health perspective |isbn=0-340-81025-4}}{{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cross-sectional studies indicated that sedentary people can decrease BMI by becoming more physically active. Smaller effects are seen in prospective cohort studies which lend to support active mobility as a means to prevent a further increase in BMI.&lt;ref name="Dons"&gt;{{cite journal

===Clinical practice===
BMI categories are generally regarded as a satisfactory tool for measuring whether sedentary individuals are ''underweight'', ''overweight'', or ''obese'' with various exceptions, such as: athletes, children, the elderly, and the infirm.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Also, the growth of a child is documented against a BMI-measured growth chart. Obesity trends can then be calculated from the difference between the child's BMI and the BMI on the chart.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In the United States, BMI is also used as a measure of underweight, owing to advocacy on behalf of those with eating disorders, such as [[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia nervosa]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

===Legislation===
In France, Israel, Italy and Spain, legislation has been introduced banning usage of fashion show models having a BMI below 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3770696/france-banned-ultra-thin-models/|title=France Just Banned Ultra-Thin Models|author=Laura Stampler|work=TIME.com|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410084813/http://time.com/3770696/france-banned-ultra-thin-models/|archive-date=2015-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, a BMI below 18.5 is banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/israeli-law-bans-skinny-bmi-challenged-models/story?id=18116291|title=Israeli Law Bans Skinny, BMI-Challenged Models|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210120342/http://abcnews.go.com/International/israeli-law-bans-skinny-bmi-challenged-models/story?id=18116291|archive-date=2014-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done in order to fight [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] among models and people interested in fashion.

===Scaling===
The exponent in the denominator of the formula for BMI is arbitrary. The BMI depends upon weight and the ''square'' of height. Since mass increases to the ''3rd power'' of linear dimensions, taller individuals with exactly the same body shape and relative composition have a larger BMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor RS | title = Letter to the editor | journal = Paediatrics &amp; Child Health | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 258 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 21532785 | pmc = 2912631 | doi=10.1093/pch/15.5.258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematician Prof [[Lloyd N. Trefethen|Nick Trefethen]], who observed this said, “BMI divides the weight by too large a number for short people and too small a number for tall people. So short people are misled into thinking that they are thinner than they are, and tall people are misled into thinking they are fatter.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9815052/Short-people-fatter-than-they-think-under-new-BMI.html|title=Short people 'fatter than they think' under new BMI|date=21 January 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823193248/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9815052/Short-people-fatter-than-they-think-under-new-BMI.html|archive-date=23 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For US adults, exponent estimates range from 1.92 to 1.96 for males and from 1.45 to 1.95 for females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Weight-height relationships and body mass index: some observations from the Diverse Populations Collaboration | journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = 128 | issue = 1 | pages = 220–9 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 15761809 | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.20107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levitt DG, Heymsfield SB, Pierson RN, Shapses SA, Kral JG | title = Physiological models of body composition and human obesity | journal = Nutrition &amp; Metabolism | volume = 4 | pages = 19 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17883858 | pmc = 2082278 | doi = 10.1186/1743-7075-4-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ignores variation in physical characteristics===
The BMI overestimates roughly 10% for a large (or tall) frame and underestimates roughly 10% for a smaller frame (short stature). In other words, persons with small frames would be carrying more fat than optimal, but their BMI reflects that they are ''normal''. Conversely, large framed (or tall) individuals may be quite healthy, with a fairly low body fat percentage, but be classified as ''overweight'' by BMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265215.php|title=Why BMI is inaccurate and misleading|work=Medical News Today|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723131349/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265215.php|archive-date=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a height/weight chart may say the ideal weight (BMI 21.5) for a man {{convert|5|ft|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} is {{convert|150|lb|kg}}. But if that man has a slender build (small frame), he may be overweight at {{convert|150|lb|kg}} and should reduce by 10%, to roughly {{convert|135|lb|kg}} (BMI 19.4). In the reverse, the man with a larger frame and more solid build should increase by 10%, to roughly {{convert|165|lb|kg}} (BMI 23.7). If one teeters on the edge of small/medium or medium/large, common sense should be used in calculating one's ideal weight. However, falling into one's ideal weight range for height and build is still not as accurate in determining health risk factors as waist/height ratio and actual body fat percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/255712.php|title=BMI: is the body mass index formula flawed?|work=Medical News Today|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723095030/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/255712.php|archive-date=2015-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accurate frame size calculators use several measurements (wrist circumference, elbow width, neck circumference and others) to determine what category an individual falls into for a given height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/39097-bmi-not-accurate-health-measure.html|title=BMI Not a Good Measure of Healthy Body Weight, Researchers Argue|work=LiveScience.com|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721123646/http://www.livescience.com/39097-bmi-not-accurate-health-measure.html|archive-date=2015-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BMI also fails to take into account loss of height through aging. In this situation, BMI will increase without any corresponding increase in weight.

===Does not differentiate between muscle mass and fat mass===
Assumptions about the distribution between muscle mass and fat mass are inexact. BMI generally overestimates [[adipose tissue|adiposity]] on those with more lean body mass (e.g., athletes) and underestimates excess adiposity on those with less lean body mass. A study in June 2008 by Romero-Corral et al. examined 13,601 subjects from the United States' third [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] (NHANES III) and found that BMI-defined obesity (BMI &gt; 30) was present in 21% of men and 31% of women.

Using [[body fat percentage]]s (BF%), however, BF-defined obesity was found in 50% of men and 62% of women. While BMI-defined obesity showed high [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] (95% for men and 99% for women), BMI showed poor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] (36% for men and 49% for women). Despite this undercounting of obesity by BMI, BMI values in the intermediate BMI range of 20–30 were found to be associated with a wide range of body fat percentages. For men with a BMI of 25, about 20% have a body fat percentage below 20% and about 10% have body fat percentage above 30%.&lt;ref name="RomeroCorral2008"/&gt;

BMI is particularly inaccurate for people who are very fit or athletic, as their high muscle mass can classify them in the ''overweight'' category by BMI, even though their body fat percentages frequently fall in the 10–15% category, which is below that of a more sedentary person of average build who has a ''normal'' BMI number.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} For example, bodybuilder and eight-time [[Mr. Olympia]] [[Ronnie Coleman]] would be considered [[Classification of obesity|morbidly obese]] based on his BMI of 41.8.&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie Coleman is 5'11" tall and weighed 300 lbs during competition. {{cite web|title=Ronnie Coleman Pro Bodybuilding Profile, Bodybuilding.com|date=July 22, 2013|url=https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bodybuilders-ronnie.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Body composition for athletes is often better calculated using measures of body fat, as determined by such techniques as skinfold measurements or underwater weighing and the limitations of manual measurement have also led to new, alternative methods to measure obesity, such as the [[body volume index]].

===Variation in definitions of categories===
It is not clear where on the BMI scale the threshold for ''[[overweight]]'' and ''[[obesity|obese]]'' should be set. Because of this the standards have varied over the past few decades. Between 1980 and 2000 the U.S. Dietary Guidelines have defined overweight at a variety of levels ranging from a BMI of 24.9 to 27.1. In 1985 the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) consensus conference recommended that overweight BMI be set at a BMI of 27.8 for men and 27.3 for women.

In 1998 a NIH report concluded that a BMI over 25 is overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/HEALTH/9806/17/weight.guidelines/ |title=Who's fat? New definition adopted |date=June 17, 1998 |access-date=2014-07-15 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515082415/http://edition.cnn.com/HEALTH/9806/17/weight.guidelines/ |archive-date=May 15, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) decided that a BMI of 25 to 30 should be considered overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese, the standards the NIH set. This became the definitive guide for determining if someone is overweight.

The current WHO and NIH ranges of ''normal'' weights are proved to be associated with decreased risks of some diseases such as diabetes type II; however using the same range of BMI for men and women is considered arbitrary, and makes the definition of underweight quite unsuitable for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/medical.htm|title=Ideal Weight and definition of Overweight|author=Halls|work=Moose and Doc|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126140124/http://halls.md/ideal-weight/medical.htm|archive-date=2011-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that the vast majority of people labelled 'overweight' and 'obese' according to current definitions do not in fact face any meaningful increased risk for early death. In a quantitative analysis of a number of studies, involving more than 600,000 men and women, the lowest mortality rates were found for people with BMIs between 23 and 29; most of the 25–30 range considered 'overweight' was not associated with higher risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campos P, Saguy A, Ernsberger P, Oliver E, Gaesser G | title = The epidemiology of overweight and obesity: public health crisis or moral panic? | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–60 | date = February 2006 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyi254 | access-date =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variation in relationship to health===
A study published by ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (''JAMA'') in 2005 showed that ''overweight'' people had a death rate similar to ''normal'' weight people as defined by BMI, while ''underweight'' and ''obese'' people had a higher death rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flegal KM, Graubard BI, Williamson DF, Gail MH | title = Excess deaths associated with underweight, overweight, and obesity | journal = JAMA | volume = 293 | issue = 15 | pages = 1861–7 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15840860 | doi = 10.1001/jama.293.15.1861 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published by ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 2009 involving 900,000 adults showed that ''overweight'' and ''underweight'' people both had a mortality rate higher than ''normal'' weight people as defined by BMI. The optimal BMI was found to be in the range of 22.5–25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitlock G, Lewington S, Sherliker P, Clarke R, Emberson J, Halsey J, Qizilbash N, Collins R, Peto R | title = Body-mass index and cause-specific mortality in 900 000 adults: collaborative analyses of 57 prospective studies | journal = Lancet | volume = 373 | issue = 9669 | pages = 1083–96 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19299006 | pmc = 2662372 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60318-4 | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60318-4/fulltext | access-date = July 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an analysis of 40 studies involving 250,000 people, patients with coronary artery disease with ''normal'' BMIs were at higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease than people whose BMIs put them in the ''overweight'' range (BMI 25–29.9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Romero-Corral A, Montori VM, Somers VK, Korinek J, Thomas RJ, Allison TG, Mookadam F, Lopez-Jimenez F | title = Association of bodyweight with total mortality and with cardiovascular events in coronary artery disease: a systematic review of cohort studies | journal = Lancet | volume = 368 | issue = 9536 | pages = 666–78 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16920472 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69251-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that BMI had a good general correlation with body fat percentage, and noted that obesity has overtaken smoking as the world's number one cause of death. But it also notes that in the study 50% of men and 62% of women were obese according to body fat defined obesity, while only 21% of men and 31% of women were obese according to BMI, meaning that BMI was found to underestimate the number of obese subjects.&lt;ref name="RomeroCorral2008"/&gt;

A 2010 study that followed 11,000 subjects for up to eight years concluded that BMI is not a good measure for the risk of heart attack, stroke or death.

===BMI Prime===
BMI Prime, a modification of the BMI system, is the ratio of actual BMI to upper limit optimal BMI (currently defined at 25&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), i.e., the actual BMI expressed as a proportion of upper limit optimal. The ratio of actual body weight to body weight for upper limit optimal BMI (25&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is equal to BMI Prime. BMI Prime is a [[dimensionless number]] independent of units. Individuals with BMI Prime less than 0.74 are underweight; those with between 0.74 and 1.00 have optimal weight; and those at 1.00 or greater are overweight. BMI Prime is useful clinically because it shows by what ratio (e.g. 1.36) or percentage (e.g. 136%, or 36% above) a person deviates from the maximum optimal BMI.

For instance, a person with BMI 34&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has a BMI Prime of 34/25 = 1.36, and is 36% over their upper mass limit. In South East Asian and South Chinese populations (see [[#International variations|§ international variations]]) BMI Prime should be calculated using an upper limit BMI of 23 in the denominator instead of 25. BMI Prime allows easy comparison between populations whose upper-limit optimal BMI values differ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gadzik J | title = "How much should I weigh?"--Quetelet's equation, upper weight limits, and BMI prime | journal = Connecticut Medicine | volume = 70 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–8 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16768059 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waist circumference===
{{Main|Waist-to-height ratio|Waist-to-hip ratio}}
Waist circumference is a good indicator of [[visceral fat]], which poses more health risks than fat elsewhere. According to the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), waist circumference in excess of {{convert|102|cm}} for men and {{convert|88|cm}} for (non-pregnant) women, is considered to imply a high risk for type 2 diabetes, [[dyslipidemia]], hypertension, and CVD. Waist circumference can be a better indicator of obesity-related disease risk than BMI. For example, this is the case in populations of Asian descent and older people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-pro/guidelines/current/obesity-guidelines/e_textbook/txgd/4142.htm |title=Obesity Education Initiative Electronic Textbook - Treatment Guidelines |website=US National Institutes of Health |date= |author= |access-date=29 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501084223/https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-pro/guidelines/current/obesity-guidelines/e_textbook/txgd/4142.htm |archive-date=1 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|94|cm}} for men and {{convert|80|cm}} for women has been stated to pose "higher risk", with the NIH figures "even higher".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/849.aspx?CategoryID=51|title=Why is my waist size important?|website=UK HNS Choices|date=|author=|access-date=29 July 2016|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806210351/http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/849.aspx?CategoryID=51|archive-date=6 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waist-to-hip circumference ratio has also been used, but has been found to be no better than waist circumference alone, and more complicated to measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-definition/abdominal-obesity/|title=Waist Size Matters|website=Harvard School of Public Health|date=|author=|access-date=29 July 2016|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821092935/https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-definition/abdominal-obesity/|archive-date=21 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related indicator is waist circumference divided by height. The values indicating increased risk are: greater than 0.5 for people under 40 year of age, 0.5 to 0.6 for people aged 40–50, and greater than 0.6 for people over 50 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hospimedica.com/critical-care/articles/294746805/waist-height-ratio-better-than-bmi-for-gauging-mortality.html |title=Waist-Height Ratio Better Than BMI for Gauging Mortality |date=18 Jun 2013 |access-date=7 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417064352/http://www.hospimedica.com/critical-care/articles/294746805/waist-height-ratio-better-than-bmi-for-gauging-mortality.html |archive-date=17 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface-based body shape index ===
The Surface-based Body Shape Index (SBSI) is far more rigorous and is based upon four key measurements: the body surface area, vertical trunk circumference, waist circumference and height. Data on 11,808 subjects from the National Health and Human Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 1999–2004, showed that SBSI outperformed BMI, waist circumference, and [[Body Shape Index|A Body Shape Index (ABSI)]], an alternative to BMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A New Potential Replacement for Body Mass Index {{!}} RealClearScience|url = http://www.realclearscience.com/journal_club/2015/12/30/a_new_potential_replacement_for_body_mass_index_109492.html|website = www.realclearscience.com|access-date = 2015-12-31|deadurl = no|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160101113606/http://www.realclearscience.com/journal_club/2015/12/30/a_new_potential_replacement_for_body_mass_index_109492.html|archive-date = 2016-01-01|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rahman2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rahman SA, Adjeroh D | title = Surface-Based Body Shape Index and Its Relationship with All-Cause Mortality | journal = PLOS One | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = e0144639 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26709925 | pmc = 4692532 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0144639 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144639 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160525084053/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0144639 | df =  | deadurl = no | bibcode = 2015PLoSO..1044639R | archive-date = 2016-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SBSI} = \frac{(\text{H}^{7/4})(\text{WC}^{5/6})}{\text{BSA VTC}}&lt;/math&gt;

A simplified, dimensionless form of SBSI, known as SBSI&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, has also been developed.&lt;ref name="rahman2015" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SBSI^\star} = \frac{(\text{H}^{2})(\text{WC})}{\text{BSA VTC}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Modified body mass index===
Within some medical contexts, such as [[familial amyloid polyneuropathy]], serum albumin is factored in to produce a modified body mass index (mBMI). The mBMI can be obtained by multiplying the BMI by serum albumin, in grams per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsuchiya A, Yazaki M, Kametani F, Takei Y, Ikeda S | title = Marked regression of abdominal fat amyloid in patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy during long-term follow-up after liver transplantation | journal = Liver Transplantation | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 563–70 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18383093 | doi = 10.1002/lt.21395 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breakthrough therapy''' is a United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] designation that expedites drug development that was created by Congress under Section 902 of the 9 July 2012 [[Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darrow|first1=JJ|last2=Avorn|first2=J|last3=Kesselheim|first3=AS|title=New FDA breakthrough-drug category—implications for patients.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=27 March 2014|volume=370|issue=13|pages=1252–8|pmid=24670173|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhle1311493|doi=10.1056/nejmhle1311493}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yandell|first1=Kate|title=Picking Up the Pace|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/44773/title/Picking-Up-the-Pace/|work=The Scientist|date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA's "breakthrough therapy" designation is not intended to imply that a drug is actually a "breakthrough" or that there is high-quality evidence of treatment efficacy for a particular condition;&lt;ref name=healthnews&gt;{{cite news|vauthors=Schwitzer G|title=CBS proclaims 'cancer breakthrough' – doesn't explain what FDA means by that term | url=http://www.healthnewsreview.org/2016/05/cbs-proclaims-cancer-breakthrough-doesnt-explain-what-fda-means-by-that-term/ | work=Health News Review | date=13 May 2016 | accessdate = 9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25713472" /&gt; rather, it allows the FDA to grant [[Priority review (FDA)|priority review]] to drug candidates if preliminary [[clinical trial]]s indicate that the therapy may offer substantial treatment advantages over existing options for patients with serious or life-threatening diseases.&lt;ref name="pmid25713472"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kepplinger EE | title = FDA's Expedited Approval Mechanisms for New Drug Products | journal = Biotechnol Law Rep | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–37 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25713472 | pmc = 4326266 | doi = 10.1089/blr.2015.9999 | quote = The fourth expedited approval mechanism—the Breakthrough Therapy designation—applies to a new drug product if it "is intended, alone or in combination with 1 or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on 1 or more clinically significant endpoints."&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt; In its Final Guidance, FDA has interpreted "preliminary clinical evidence" to mean evidence "sufficient to indicate that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement in effectiveness or safety over available therapies, but in most cases is not sufficient to establish safety and effectiveness for purposes of approval."&lt;sup&gt;173&lt;/sup&gt; This generally will require more than data from in vitro studies or animal models.&lt;sup&gt;174&lt;/sup&gt; FDA expects preliminary clinical evidence to come from Phase 1 or 2 clinical trials.&lt;sup&gt;175&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA_2012"&gt;{{cite web | title=Fact Sheet: Breakthrough Therapies | publisher = United States Food and Drug Administration | url = https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/LawsEnforcedbyFDA/SignificantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/FDASIA/ucm329491.htm | deadurl=no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171009081511/https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/LawsEnforcedbyFDA/SignificantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/FDASIA/ucm329491.htm | date = 10 December 2014 | accessdate = 9 October 2017 | archivedate = 9 October 2017 | quote = A breakthrough therapy is a drug:&lt;br /&gt;{{bull}}intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and&lt;br /&gt;{{bull}}preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA has other mechanisms for expediting the review and approval process for promising drugs, including [[fast track (FDA)|fast track]] designation, [[accelerated approval (FDA)|accelerated approval]], and [[priority review (FDA)|priority review]].&lt;ref name="pmid25713472" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/SignificantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/FDASIA/ucm341027.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Requirements ==
A breakthrough therapy designation can be assigned to a drug if "it is a drug which is intended alone or in [[combination therapy|combination]] with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition" and if the [[clinical trial|preliminary clinical evidence]] indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development."&lt;ref name="FDA_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FDASIA_2015"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/FederalFoodDrugandCosmeticActFDCAct/SignificantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/FDASIA/ |title=Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |location=Silver Spring, MD |date=29 January 2015 |accessdate=20 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718082406/http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/FederalFoodDrugandCosmeticActFDCAct/SignificantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/FDASIA/ |archivedate=18 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Requests are reviewed by the [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] (CDER) and the [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research]] (CBER). CDER receives approximately 100 requests per year for breakthrough designation. Historically, about one third were approved. CBER receives 15–30 requests per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/DrugandBiologicApprovalReports/INDActivityReports/ucm373559.htm|title=IND Activity Reports - Breakthrough Therapy Designation Requests|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|last=Research|website=www.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsors must apply for breakthrough status separately for each indication they intend to label the drug for.

Breakthrough designation applications are submitted as an amendment to the [[Investigational new drug|IND]] applications before the initiation of clinical trials.&lt;ref name="fda.gov"&gt;http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm358301.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incentives ==
Drugs that have been granted breakthrough status are given priority review. The FDA works with the sponsor of the drug application to expedite the approval process. This expedited process can include rolling reviews, smaller clinical trials, and alternative trial designs.&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt;

== Issues ==
Critics have said that the name is misleading and provides companies that obtain a breakthrough designation for a drug candidate with a marketing advantage that may be undeserved.&lt;ref name="JAMAIM"&gt;{{cite journal| title =Editor's Note: Would a Breakthrough Therapy by Any Other Name Be as Promising? | journal =JAMA Intern. Med. | date =21 September 2015 | author =Joseph S. Ross | author2 =Rita F.

It was never meant to imply that these drugs are actually “breakthroughs,” and it does not ensure that they will provide clinical benefit, but still critics complain that they are based on preliminary evidence, including changes in surrogate markers such as laboratory measurements, that often don't reflect "meaningful clinical benefit."&lt;ref name=healthnews /&gt;
The FDA guidance states: "Not all products designated as breakthrough therapies ultimately will be shown to have the substantial improvement over available therapies suggested by the preliminary clinical evidence at the time of designation.  If the designation is no longer supported by subsequent data, FDA may rescind the designation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance for Industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions – Drugs and Biologics|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM358301.pdf|publisher=FDA|page=10|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''child disability allowance''' is a payment made by the [[government of New Zealand]] to the parent or [[legal guardian|guardian]] of a seriously disabled child who incurs regular costs by having a [[disability]]. It is not [[means-tested benefit|means-tested]].  The child must have been assessed as needing constant care and attention for at least 12 months because of a serious disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Disability Allowance|url=http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/a-z-benefits/child-disability-allowance.html|website=Work and Income|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4481">'''China Medical Board, Inc.''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] that promotes [[health education]] and [[medical research|research]] in the [[medical universities]] of China and Southeast Asia. Its mission is "to advance health, equity, and the quality of care in China and Southeast Asia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinamedicalboard.org/sites/chinamedicalboard.org/files/cmb-biennial-report-2012-2014-web.pdf China Medical Board Biennial Report 2012-2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Board was founded in 1914 as the second major project of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. With additional endowments from the Rockefeller Foundation, China Medical Board became an independent private foundation in 1928. From 1914 to 1951, China Medical worked to establish Peking Union Medical College. Its goal from the outset was full Chinese ownership, operations, financing, and faculty at Peking Union Medical College, which was achieved in 1950.

In 1951, China Medical Board could not operate in China for political reasons. During this time, China Medical Board focused its attention in advancing public health in other countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia. In 1980, it resumed activities in China and has been a continuous presence in China ever since.

Over the years, China Medical Board has supported 118 medical schools in 17 Asian countries, 28 of which are in China. Its work has focused on capacity building by providing facilities, educational material, laboratories, fellowships, and faculty development. In total, China Medical Board is estimated to have invested $1–5 billion in fostering public health in Asia. The current president of China Medical Board is Dr. Lincoln Chen, who is compensated over $400,000 annually plus benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)60965-X/abstract China Medical Board: a century of Rockefeller health philanthropy]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, China Medical Board has over $200 million in asset. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4965392&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Today, China Medical Board focuses on health policy and systems reform and medical professional education reform. It works with 24 medical universities throughout China and in parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)60965-X/abstract China Medical Board: a century of Rockefeller health philanthropy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Congress of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nurses and Midwives'''(CATSINaM) is the peak national body that represents, advocates for and supports Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nurses and midwives in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthinfonet.ecu.edu.au/key-resources/organisations?oid=698|title=Congress of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nurses and Midwives (CATSINaM)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407042130/http://www.healthinfonet.ecu.edu.au/key-resources/organisations?oid=698|archive-date=2018-04-07|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organisation is located in Canberra, in the ACT.

== Objectives ==

CATSINaM advocates for improved health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. CATSINaM seeks to increase the number of practising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nurses and midwives through improved recruitment and retention, and its [https://croakey.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CATSINaM17_ConferenceReport.pdf annual professional development conference] contributes to this strategy. The number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nurses and midwives grew from 2,246 or 0.79% of the Australian nursing and midwifery workforce in 2011 to 3,201 in 2016, or 1.02% of the nursing and midwifery workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catsinam.org.au/static/uploads/files/catsinam2017ar-web-optimised-wffzixbcwsmj.pdf|title=CATSINaM annual report 2016-2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310084353/http://catsinam.org.au/static/uploads/files/catsinam2017ar-web-optimised-wffzixbcwsmj.pdf|archive-date=2018-03-10|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CATSINaM develops and promotes strategies to ensure the [[cultural safety]] of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients and health professionals, particularly for CATSINaM members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nswnma.asn.au/creating-positive-change|title=Creating Positive Change|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325124049/http://www.nswnma.asn.au/creating-positive-change/|archive-date=2018-03-25|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CATSINaM advocates for a national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nursing and midwifery workforce strategy, cultural safety to be embedded into health practitioner legislation, and the development of a “health barometer” to measure race relations and cultural safety within the health system. In June 2017, CATSINaM secured a three-year funding agreement with the Australian Government Department of Health for the establishment of a ‘Leaders in Indigenous Nursing and Midwifery Education Network’ or [http://catsinam.org.au/static/uploads/files/catsinam2017ar-web-optimised-wffzixbcwsmj.pdf LINMEN]. 

CATSINaM provides policy advice to governments and a range of agencies, including universities, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia and the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, and works collaboratively with many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations. In 2016 CATSINaM began coordinating the establishment of an International Alliance of First Nations Nurses and Midwives. Alliance Members include: Australia, New Zealand, Hawai`i and Canada, with some other Pacific Island nations also 
included through the Pacific Nursing Section of the [[New Zealand Nurses Organisation]].

== History ==

CATSIN was founded in 1997 to formally represent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nurses and midwives. A grant from the Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH) to the [[Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation]] provided for the first national meeting of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
nurses in August 1997. Held in Sydney, the three-day meeting developed a series of recommendations for strategies and initiatives to advance the recruitment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into nursing. In 1998, CATSIN was incorporated and until July 2012, led by its founding Executive 
Director, [[Sally Goold|Dr Sally Goold OAM]], a Wiradjuri woman. In 2016, CATSINaM established two new award categories to formally honour the outstanding  achievements of members, and Sally Goold was the first inductee into the CATSINaM ‘Hall of Fame’.

Since 2013, CATSINaM has been led by CEO Janine Mohamed, a Nurrunga Kaurna woman from Point Pearce mission on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. Mohamed has urged the nursing and midwifery professions to follow the lead of the [[Australian Psychological Society]] in making a formal apology to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://croakey.org/a-call-to-acknowledge-the-harmful-history-of-nursing-for-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-people/|title=A call to acknowledge the harmful history of nursing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507155100/https://croakey.org/a-call-to-acknowledge-the-harmful-history-of-nursing-for-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-people/|archive-date=2018-05-07|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://croakey.org/australias-nursesmidwives-consider-call-to-apologise-for-harms-to-indigenous-people/|title=Australia’s nurses/midwives consider call to apologise for harms to Indigenous people|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507153447/https://croakey.org/australias-nursesmidwives-consider-call-to-apologise-for-harms-to-indigenous-people/|archive-date=2018-05-07|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

CATSINaM is a company limited by guarantee and operates within the Corporations Act 2001 (Commonwealth) as well as the CATSINaM 
Constitution registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). CATSINaM has an eight-member Aboriginal and or Torres Strait Islander Board of Directors who represent each state and territory, and must be currently registered as a nurse or midwife. They undertake a two-year tenure and have the option to be elected for a further two-year term to a maximum of four consecutive years. The Board elects CATSINaM’s President for a two-year term and he/she may serve up to two terms. CATSINaM is primarily funded by the Australian Government’s Department of Health, and also raises revenue through the provision of training services.

'''Don Cenobio Sauza''' (October 30, 1842 &amp;ndash; February 15, 1909), known as the "Father of Tequila,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iWYM-xq3p6AC&amp;pg=PA110 | title = Mexico | author = Marilen Andrist | pages = 110 | year = 1998 | publisher = Hunter Publishing, Inc|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the earliest and longest lasting distillers of the [[tequila]] spirit &amp;ndash;  founding the [[Sauza Tequila]] distillery – La Perseverancia – in 1873.

==Early life==
Cenobio Sauza was born on a farm in [[Jalisco]], [[Mexico]]. He was the third child of Hilario Sauza (died 1857) and Doña Margarita Madrigal Navarro. He worked on his father’s farm together with his siblings Adelaida, Juana, Fernanda, Luis and Herminia until he was sixteen.

In 1858 Cenobio traveled to Tequila to visit his cousin [[Ramón Corona|Ramon Corona Madrigal]]. Enamored with the county, Cenobio settled in Tequila and got a job working at the distillery of [[José Antonio Gómez Cuervo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://www.amazon.com/gp/sitbv3/reader?asin=0415948134&amp;pageID=S02Z&amp;checkSum=yuDPNTlmdYwnM5wB1BIa/5rsBg%208ZYT4YqTm45CRENM= | title = Intoxicated Identities: Alcohol's Power in Mexican History and Culture | author = Tim Mitchell | pages = 97 | year = 2004 | publisher = Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Tequila (Jalisco)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the book: "Historia de la Industria Tequila Sauza: Tres Generaciones y una Tradición" (1963) by Gabriel Agraz: {{cite web |url=http://www.tequila-z.com/libros.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329101027/http://www.tequila-z.com/libros.php |archivedate=2010-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There he learned how to farm [[agave]] and distill mezcal-tequila wine.

==Beginning his Career==
Cenobio began to export mezcal-tequila wine from Tequila to other parts of the country. In 1870, no longer content to just sell, Sauza leased the "La Gallardeña" distillery from Lazaro Gallardo.&lt;ref name="Chronological History of Tequila"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.elduendetequila.com/history-of-tequila.htm | title = Chronological History of Tequila}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sauza was successful enough that three years later, on September 1, 1873 he purchased the La Antigua Cruz (The Old Cross) distillery (the oldest registered tequila distillery, founded in 1805 by José Maria Castañeda) from Don Felix Lopez for 5,000 pesos and renamed it La Perseverancia (Perseverance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianchadwick.com/tequila/18-19th%20centuries.htm|title=Tequila's History: Part 2 of 3: 18th &amp; 19th Centuries}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former employee of Cuervo had successfully founded Sauza Tequila – becoming one of Cuervo's great rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Casa-Cuervo-SA-de-CV-Company-History.html | title = Casa Cuervo, S.A. de C.V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 Sauza was the first to export tequila to the [[United States]] when he crossed through the border at [[El Paso del Norte]] (Northern Pass) carrying three casks and six jugs of his mezcal-tequila wine. This was the beginning of the [[export]] market for tequila.&lt;ref name="Anthony Dias Blue 2004"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Hln0nEBZsoC&amp;pg=PA122 |title=The Complete Book of Spirits | author = Anthony Dias Blue | pages = 112 | year = 2004 | publisher = HarperCollins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and children==
Cenobio married Doña Margarita Muro, with whom he had seven children, all born in the city of Tequila:
* Jose Leopoldo Cenobio (born 1875)
* Alfonso Cenobio (born 1877)
* Jose Jorge Cenobio (born 1879)
* Benjamin Cenobio (born 1881)
* Eladio Cenobio (born 1883)
* Maria Graciela Cenobio (born 1885)
* Roberto Cenobio (born 1887)

==Growing Sauza Tequila==
The arrival of the railroad in Tequila increased Sauza’s business and in 1889 he purchased the "La Gallardeña" distillery from Lazaro Gallardo. The same year he also purchased the Hacienda de San Martin de las Cañas from Vicente Orendain.&lt;ref name="Chronological History of Tequila"/&gt; This became Sauza’s headquarters and was simply known as La Hacienda. Cenobio planted more than 2 million agave and started producing about 800 casks of tequila a year at La Hacienda. He purchased and sold thirteen more distilleries and numerous fields of agave, always working at least three at a time in order to remain the leader in tequila production and sales.

Don Cenobio is credited with determining that the [[blue agave]] was the best agave for tequila in the 1890s, and others in the industry echoed his choice.&lt;ref name="Anthony Dias Blue 2004"/&gt;

==Other Enterprises==
Cenobio’s interests extended beyond the production of tequila, including:
* From 1884 &amp;ndash; 1885 Cenobio was the Municipal President of the Village of Tequila in the western Mexican state of Jalisco. He was succeeded by [[Ignacio Romero]].
* In 1888 he attempted to enter the mining field.

==The Final Years==
Cenobio continued to grow his tequila business until his death at age 67 in his residence in Guadalajara. His innovation and perseverance helped to create a great industry and economy for Jalisco.  At his death, Cenobio left the Sauza Tequila empire in the hands of his son [[Don Eladio Sauza]].

'''E Health Point''' are model public health units, owned and operated by HealthPoint Services India (HSI), a for-profit company launched in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthmarketinnovations.org/program/e-health-point-0|title=E Health Point|work=Center for Health Market Innovations|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The units provide families in rural villages with clean drinking water, medicines, comprehensive diagnostic tools, and advanced tele-medical services that “bring” a doctor and modern, evidence-based healthcare to their community. The program was initially launched in [[India]] and has plans to expand to [[South America]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref name = "MIT" /&gt;

E Health Point provides preventive and curative healthcare services as well as access to drinking water. E Health Point Electronic Medical Records provide knowledge of the health profile of a community and also constitute a real-time disease surveillance capability, alerting local and state health administration on new disease outbreaks. Typically an E Health Point location starts out as a water service, then expands to a clinic as it becomes established. As of 2011 there were eight clinics and sixteen water points in India.&lt;ref name = "MIT" /&gt;

== Safe drinking water ==

[[Water treatment]] is provided via advanced [[reverse osmosis]] and ultra-filtration units, providing clean water for drinking and cooking on a monthly subscription basis as a preventative measure against water-borne diseases. The water units also sell contraceptives and healthcare products.

== Tele-medical consultation ==

Consultation with qualified doctors and trained health workers is provided via video-conferencing from HealthPoint’s urban tele-medical centre.

== Advanced diagnostics ==

Diagnostics are located at each E Health Point clinic. They provide the attending tele-medical center doctor with the patient’s vital signs—including digital stethoscope, non-invasive blood pressure monitor, and [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) - and offer more than 70 additional diagnostic tests covering all major infectious diseases and many chronic conditions, including malnutrition, heart disease, and diabetes.

== Pharmaceuticals and medicines ==

Each E Health Point clinic has a unit of pharmacy that dispenses primarily branded generics medicines, as well as a range of over-the-counter drugs, by a licensed pharmacist.

== Referrals ==

Referrals to public and private hospitals are made for patient conditions - such as childbirth, acute trauma, heart attack, cancer, and others—which are beyond the primary care treatment scope of the E HealthPoint unit; patients are provided with specific advice and a printed referral.

== Collaborations ==
Health Point Services works in collaboration with departments of the Government of Punjab; Government of Andhra Pradesh. HSI also has partnership with prominent organizations in Water; HealthCare and IT such as Bhati AirTel; Fontus &amp; Aventura Water; Piramal Water; [[Athenahealth]] USA, Sensaris USA; Dimagi at Boston; Prognosys; [[Procter and Gamble]] (P&amp;G); and Academic &amp; Research Institutions like CEGA – University of California; Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and Santa Clara California. HSI also works with the impact groups like Toniic Network; The Social Impact Network; KL Felicitas Foundation; The Eleos Foundation.

'''Faridpur Medical College''' ('''FMC''') ({{lang-bn|ফরিদপুর মেডিকেল কলেজ}}) is a [[Public university|government]] [[medical school]] in Bangladesh, established in 1992. It is located in [[Faridpur Sadar Upazila|Faridpur town]], headquarters of [[Faridpur District]]. It is affiliated with [[University of Dhaka]] as a constituent college.

It offers a five-year course of study leading to a [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS) degree. A one-year [[internship]] after graduation is compulsory for all graduates. The degree is recognised by the [[Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council]].

The college is associated with 500-bed Faridpur Medical College Hospital (FMCH). ''Faridpur Medical College Journal'' (''FMCJ'') is the official journal of FMC.

==History==
The government of Bangladesh established Faridpur Medical College in 1992 by upgrading an existing Medical Assistant Training School (MATS).&lt;ref name=Banglapedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Choudhury |first=MKI Quayyum |year=2012 |chapter=Faridpur Medical College |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Faridpur_Medical_College |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the management of the college resolved to rename it Sheikh Hasina Medical College. In 2014, it was reported that [[Sheikh Hasina]] vetoed the name change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=24 April 2014 |title=Sheikh Hasina's wise decision |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/sheikh-hasinas-wise-decision-21303 |newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students at the college demonstrated in 2015, calling for the reinstatement of the "carry on" examination system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 August 2015 |title=Medical students demand restoring carry-on system |url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2015/aug/02/medical-students-demand-restoring-carry-system |newspaper=Dhaka Tribune |access-date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS) degree programme is divided into three parts by the first, second, and third professional examinations. If a student fails one of these exams, they may sit it again six months later. Under the 2002 "carry on" system, students could continue taking classes in the next academic session while preparing to retake an exam. This system was strongly favoured by medical students, but strongly opposed by their teachers. The [[Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council]] eliminated "carry on" in 2013, after which students who failed a professional exam were not allowed to continue classes until they had passed it, causing them to lose up to a year in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mosaddek |first1=Abu Syed Md. |last2=Nargis |first2=Waheeda |last3=Ahamed |first3=Borhan Uddin |last4=Islam |first4=Md.

==Academics==
The college offers a five-year course of study, approved by the [[Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council]] (BMDC), leading to a [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS) degree from Dhaka University. After passing the final professional examination, there is a compulsory one-year [[internship]]. The internship is a prerequisite for obtaining registration from the BMDC to practice medicine.&lt;ref name=wdoms/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bmdc.org.bd/recognized-medical-and-dental-colleges/ |title=List of Recognized medical and dental colleges |website=Bangladesh Medical &amp; Dental Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Admission for Bangladeshis to the MBBS programme at all medical colleges in Bangladesh (government and private) is conducted centrally by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). It administers a written multiple choice question exam simultaneously throughout the country. Candidates are admitted based primarily on their score on this test, although grades at [[Secondary School Certificate]] (SSC) and [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (HSC) level also play a part. Admission for foreign students is based on their SSC and HSC grades. As of August 2017, the college is allowed to admit 141 students annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dghs.gov.bd/images/docs/Publicaations/HB_2014_2nd_Edition_060115.pdf |title=Health Bulletin 2014 |date=December 2014 |website=Bureau of Health Education |edition=2nd |publisher=Ministry of Health and Family Welfare |format=PDF |page=225 |access-date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Faridpur Medical College Journal'' (''FMCJ'') is the official journal of the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bmdc.org.bd/list-of-medical-and-dental-journals/ |title=List of medical and dental journals |website=Bangladesh Medical &amp; Dental Council |access-date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a peer-reviewed, [[open access journal]], published semi-annually in January and July. It accepts original research articles, review articles on topics of current interest, and interesting case reports.

The '''female reproductive system''' is made up of the internal and external [[sex organ]]s that function in [[reproduction|reproduction of new offspring]]. In the human the female reproductive system is immature at birth and  develops to maturity at [[puberty]] to be able to produce [[gamete]]s, and to carry a [[foetus]] to [[pregnancy#Timing of childbirth|full term]]. The internal sex organs are the [[uterus]], [[Fallopian tube]]s, and [[ovary|ovaries]]. The uterus or womb accommodates the [[embryo]] which develops into the foetus. The uterus also produces [[vagina]]l  and uterine secretions which help the transit of [[sperm]] to the [[Fallopian tubes]]. The ovaries produce the ova ([[egg cell]]s). The external sex organs are also known as the ''genitals'' and these are the organs of the [[vulva]] including the [[labia]], [[clitoris]], and vaginal opening. The vagina is connected to the uterus at the [[cervix]].&lt;ref name="Ellis 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mahadevan|first1=Harold Ellis, Vishy|title=Clinical anatomy applied anatomy for students and junior doctors|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|isbn=9781118373767|edition=13th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[menstrual cycle|certain intervals]], the ovaries release an [[egg cell|ovum]], which passes through the Fallopian tube into the uterus. If, in this transit, it meets with sperm, a single sperm can enter and merge with the egg, [[fertilisation|fertilizing]] it.

[[Fertilization]] usually occurs in the [[Fallopian tube]]s and marks the beginning of [[human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]]. The [[zygote]] will then [[Mitosis|divide]] over enough generations of cells to form a [[blastocyst]], which [[implantation (embryo)|implants]] itself in the wall of the uterus. This begins the period of [[gestation]] and the embryo will continue to [[prenatal development|develop]] until [[pregnancy#Timing of childbirth|full-term]]. When the [[foetus]] has developed enough to survive outside the [[uterus]], the cervix dilates and contractions of the uterus propel the newborn through the birth canal (the vagina).

The corresponding equivalent among males is the [[human male reproductive system|male reproductive system]].

==Vulva==

{{Main|Vulva}}
The [[vulva]] consists of all of the external parts and tissues and includes the [[mons pubis]], [[pudendal cleft]], [[labia majora]], [[labia minora]], [[Bartholin's glands]], [[clitoris]], and [[vagina#Vaginal opening and hymen|vaginal opening]].

==Internal organs==
[[File:Pelvis 113721-.png|thumb|[[Sagittal plane|Sagittal]] [[MRI]] showing the location of the vagina, cervix, and uterus]]
[[File:Blausen 0400 FemaleReproSystem 02.png|thumb|Illustration depicting female reproductive system (sagittal view)]]
[[File: Scheme female reproductive system-en.svg|thumb|Frontal view as scheme of reproductive organs]]
The female internal reproductive organs are the vagina, uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries.

===Vagina===
{{Main|Vagina}}
The [[vagina]] is a fibromuscular (made up of fibrous and muscular tissue) [[vagina#Structure|canal]] leading from the outside of the body to the [[cervix]] of the [[uterus]] or womb. It is also referred to as the birth canal in the context of [[pregnancy]]. The vagina accommodates the male [[penis]] during [[sexual intercourse]]. [[Semen]] containing [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] is [[ejaculation|ejaculated]] from the male at [[orgasm]], into the vagina potentially enabling [[fertilization]] of the [[egg cell]] (ovum) to take place.

===Cervix===
{{Main|Cervix}}

The cervix is the neck of the uterus, the lower, narrow portion where it joins with the upper part of the vagina. It is [[cylindrical]] or [[cone (geometry)|conical]] in shape and protrudes through the upper anterior vaginal wall. Approximately half its length is visible, the remainder lies above the vagina beyond view. The vagina has a thick layer outside and it is the opening where the fetus emerges during delivery.

===Uterus===
{{Main|Uterus}}

The [[uterus]] or womb is the major female reproductive [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]. The uterus provides mechanical protection, nutritional support, and waste removal for the developing embryo (weeks 1 to 8) and fetus (from week 9 until the delivery). In addition, contractions in the muscular wall of the uterus are important in pushing out the fetus at the time of birth.

The uterus contains three suspensory ligaments that help stabilize the position of the uterus and limits its range of movement. The uterosacral ligaments keep the body from moving inferiorly and anteriorly. The round ligaments restrict posterior movement of the uterus. The cardinal ligaments also prevent the inferior movement of the uterus.

The uterus is a pear-shaped [[muscle|muscular]] organ. Its major function is to accept a fertilized ovum which becomes implanted into the [[endometrium]], and derives nourishment from blood vessels which develop exclusively for this purpose. The fertilized ovum becomes an [[embryo]], develops into a [[fetus]] and gestates until [[childbirth]]. If the egg does not embed in the wall of the uterus, a female begins [[menstruation]].

===Fallopian tube===
{{Main|Fallopian tube}}

The Fallopian tubes are two tubes leading from the ovaries into the uterus. On maturity of an ovum, the follicle and the ovary's wall rupture, allowing the ovum to escape and enter the Fallopian tube. There it travels toward the uterus, pushed along by movements of [[cilia]] on the inner lining of the tubes. This trip takes hours or days.  If the ovum is fertilized while in the Fallopian tube, then it normally implants in the [[endometrium]] when it reaches the uterus, which signals the beginning of [[pregnancy]].

===Ovaries===
{{Main|Ovary}}

The ovaries are small, paired organs located near the lateral walls of the pelvic cavity. These organs are responsible for the production of the [[egg cell]]s (ova) and the secretion of hormones.  The process by which the egg cell (ovum) is released is called [[ovulation]]. The speed of ovulation is [[Frequency|periodic]] and impacts directly to the length of a [[menstrual cycle]].

After ovulation, the egg cell is captured by the Fallopian tube, after traveling down the Fallopian tube to the uterus, occasionally being fertilized on its way by an incoming sperm. During fertilization the egg cell plays a role; it releases certain molecules that are essential to guiding the sperm and allows the surface of the egg to attach to the sperm's surface. The egg can then absorb the sperm and fertilization can then begin.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
The Fallopian tubes are lined with small hairs ([[cilia]]) to help the egg cell travel.

==Physiology==
The reproductive tract (or genital tract) is the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] that starts as a single pathway through the vagina, splitting up into two lumens in the uterus, both of which continue through the Fallopian tubes, and ending at the [[distal ostia of the Fallopian tubes|distal ostia]] that open into the [[abdominal cavity]].

In the absence of fertilization, the ovum will eventually traverse the entire reproductive tract from the fallopian tube until exiting the vagina through [[menstruation]].

The reproductive tract can be used for various [[transluminal procedure]]s such as [[fertiloscopy]], [[intrauterine insemination]], and transluminal [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]].

==Development==

Chromosome characteristics determine the genetic sex of a fetus at [[Fertilisation|conception]]. This is specifically based on the 23rd pair of chromosomes that is inherited. Since the mother's egg contains an X chromosome and the father's sperm contains either an X or Y [[chromosome]], it is the male who determines the fetus's sex. If the fetus inherits the X chromosome from the father, the fetus will be a female. In this case, [[testosterone]] is not made and the [[Wolffian duct]] will degrade thus, the [[Müllerian duct]] will develop into female sex organs. The [[clitoris]] is the remnants of the Wolffian duct. On the other hand, if the fetus inherits the Y chromosome from the father, the fetus will be a male. The presence of testosterone will stimulate the Wolffian duct which will bring about the development of the male sex organs and the Müllerian duct will degrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baby2see.com/gender/internal_genitals.html|title=Details of genital development|date=|accessdate= August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==
{{Further |Vulva disease}}

=== Vaginitis ===
[[Vaginitis]] is inflammation of the vagina and largely caused by an infection. It is the most common gynaecological condition presented. It is difficult to determine any one organism most responsible for vaginitis because it varies from range of age, sexual activity, and method of microbial identification. Vaginitis is not necessarily caused by a [[sexually transmitted infection]] as there are many infectious agents that make use of the close proximity to mucous membranes and secretions. Vaginitis is usually diagnosed based on the presence of vaginal discharge, which can have a certain color, odor, or quality.&lt;ref name=Zaino&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zaino, Nucci, &amp; Kurman|first1=Richard, Marisa, &amp; Robert|title=Diseas of the Vagina|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-0489-8_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bacterial vaginosis ===
{{Main|Bacterial vaginosis}}
This is a vaginal infection in women. It differs from vaginitis in that there is no inflammation. Bacterial vaginosis is polymicrobial, consisting of many [[bacteria]] species. The diagnosis for bacterial vaginosis is made if three of the following four criteria are present: (1) Homogenous, thin discharge, (2) a [[pH]] of 4.5 in the vagina, (3) [[epithelial cells]] in the vagina with bacteria attached to them, or (4) a fishy odor. It has been associated with an increased risk of other genital tract infections such as [[endometritis]].&lt;ref name=Zaino /&gt;

=== Yeast infection ===
{{Main|Vaginal yeast infection}}
This is a common cause of vaginal irritation and according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] at least 75% of adult women have experienced one at least once in their lifetime. Yeast infections are caused by an overgrowth of fungus in the vagina known as [[Candidiasis|Candida]]. Yeast infections are usually caused by an imbalance of the pH in the vagina, which is usually acidic. Other factors such as pregnancy, diabetes, weakened immune systems, tight fitting clothing, or [[douching]] can also be a cause. Symptoms of yeast infections include itching, burning, irritation, and a white cottage-cheese-like discharge from the vagina. Women have also reported that they experience painful intercourse and urination as well. Taking a sample of the vaginal secretions and placing them under a microscope for evidence of yeast can diagnose a yeast infection. Treatment varies from creams that can be applied in or around the vaginal area to oral tablets that stop the growth of fungus.&lt;ref name=Zaino /&gt;

===Genital mutilation===
{{Main|Female genital mutilation}}
There are many practices of mutilating female genitalia in different cultures. The most common two types of genital mutilation practiced are [[clitoridectomy]], the circumcision of the clitoris and the excision of the [[Clitoral hood|prepuce]] the skin around the clitoris. They can all involve a range of adverse health consequences such as [[bleeding]], irreparable tissue damage, and [[sepsis]] which can sometimes prove fatal.

===Genital surgery===
{{Main|Genitoplasty}}
[[Genitoplasty]] refers to surgery that is carried out to repair damaged sex organs particularly following cancer and its treatment.
There are also [[Elective surgery|elective surgical]] procedures which change the appearance of the external genitals.

==Reproductive rights==

The [[International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics]] was founded in 1954 to promote the well-being of women particularly in raising the standards of gynaecological practice and care. As of 2010 there were 124 countries involved.

[[Women#Reproductive rights and freedom|Reproductive rights]] are legal rights related to reproduction and [[reproductive health]]. Women have the right to control matters involving their sexuality including their sexual and reproductive health. Violation of these rights include forced pregnancy, forced sterilization, forced abortion and [[female genital mutilation|genital mutilation]]. Female genital mutilation is the complete or partial removal of a female's external [[genitals]].

==History==
It is claimed in the [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] writings that both males and females contribute their seed to conception; otherwise, children would not resemble either or both of their parents. Four-hundred years later, [[Galen]] "identified" the source of 'female semen' as the ovaries in female reproductive organs.&lt;ref&gt;Anwar, Etin. "The Transmission of Generative Self and Women's Contribution to Conception." Gender and Self in Islam. London: Routledge, 2006. 75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5234">'''Holy Cross Hospital''' is a 160-bed general medical Catholic hospital located in the [[Chicago Lawn, Chicago|Chicago Lawn]] neighborhood of [[South Side, Chicago]], [[Illinois]], at 68th Street and California Avenue.&lt;ref name="U.S."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/il/holy-cross-hospital-6430700|title=Holy Cross Hospital Overview |author= |year=2012 |work= |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The hospital was founded by the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Charities, a lay non-profit organization which entrusted the [[Sisters of Saint Casimir]] to manage it. Founded in 1928, Holy Cross Hospital is a not-for-profit neighborhood health system located in 3 locations throughout Chicago's southwest neighborhoods and suburbs. It receives the highest number of ambulance runs per year of any other hospital in the state of Illinois. The hospital is accredited by the [[American Osteopathic Association|American Osteopathic Association's]] [[Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program]].&lt;ref name="U.S."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfap.org/AccreditedFacilities/index.aspx?FacilityType=HOSPN |title=Acute Care Hospitals |author= |year=2012 |work= |publisher=Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program |accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Holy Cross completed an expansion of its emergency department, with the addition of 14 monitored patient rooms.

In December 2010, Chicago Cardinal [[Francis Eugene George]], OMI, announced that Holy Cross Hospital would become a for-profit Catholic hospital, a seemingly counter-intuitive move, and be acquired by [[Vanguard Health Systems]] of [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. It would still be considered Catholic because the Sisters would still have some reserved powers and the hospital would have to comply with the [[Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Systems]], and because the Archbishop and the Holy See both had approved the unique transaction, given that no suitable Catholic or non-Catholic not-for-profit partner could be found.

However, in August 2011 the transaction was cancelled, with both parties citing a downturn in the economy, as well as changes in [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]], as the major factors for dissolving the partnership.

In early 2013, Holy Cross completed a merger with Sinai Health System, which operates [[Mount Sinai Medical Center]] in [[West Side, Chicago]].  Because the two non-profits had merged their resources, Sinai Health System was not required to pay any monies to acquire Holy Cross. 

== Trauma center ==
On September 10, 2015, a partnership between the [[University of Chicago]] and Sinai Health Systems was announced, in which the current Holy Cross Hospital campus would undergo 40 million dollars' worth of renovations and become Chicago's first South Side adult Level 1 trauma center since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-university-of-chicago-mount-sinai-south-side-trauma-center-20150910-story.html| title=South Side to get adult trauma center after years of protest |authors=Dahleen Glanton and Dawn Rhodes |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The state-of-the art adult Level 1 trauma center that was to open at Holy Cross Hospital was to be a joint effort of Sinai Health System and University of Chicago Medicine. Sinai Health System was to furnish specialists involved in trauma care, including emergency department physicians, anesthesiologists and nursing staff, along with on-site trauma care support services at Holy Cross Hospital. In addition, University of Chicago Medicine would have provided specialists dedicated to trauma care, plus neurologists, neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, plastic surgeons, radiologists and urologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.chicago.suntimes.com/news/7/71/950604/holy-cross-hospital-get-level-1-trauma-center-south-side |title=Holy Cross Hospital to get Level 1 trauma center on South Side |author=Mitch Dudek |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On December 17, 2015, the University of Chicago announced that it had reversed course and that the new adult trauma center would now be located on the University of Chicago campus in Hyde Park instead of at Holy Cross Hospital. In that way, the University of Chicago would offer an integrated program of Level 1 trauma care for both children and adults, in addition to its existing Burn and Complex Wound Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/7/71/1188557/u-c-sinai-change-course-will-put-trauma-center-hyde-park |title=U. of C. to put adult trauma center in Hyde Park |author=Stefano Esposito |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Bell was born in [[Mount Vernon, Ohio|Mount Vernon]], [[Ohio]], on December 11, 1872. After graduating from [[Mount Vernon High School (Ohio)|Mount Vernon High School]] in 1891, he received his B.A. from [[Denison University]] in 1896. He then attended the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[University of Leipzig]] in [[Germany]] before enrolling at [[Harvard University]]. He received his A.M. and Ph.D. from Harvard in 1903 and 1904, respectively.

'''Joe McCarroll''' is a conservative campaigner in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. He has campaigned [[anti-abortion|against abortion]], [[LGBT Rights]] and [[divorce]].

He was part of the editorial group of [[The Brandsma Review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bradyco.ie/brandsma/archive/issue40/e.htm |magazine=[[The Brandsma Review]] |volume=7 |issue=6 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030426164446/http://www.bradyco.ie/brandsma/archive/issue40/e.htm |archive-date=26 April 2003 |title=We're RC- But Not Religiously Correct |first=Nick |last=Lowry |quote=Our editorial group now consists of ourselves (Nick and Mary Lowry), Joe McCarroll, Fr Brendan Purcell, David Manly, Louis Power and Peadar Laighléis |date=December 1998 – January 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divorce==
{{see also|Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland}}

Joe McCarroll, along with [[Des Hanafin]], is a founding member, and vice-chairman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Anglo-Celt|page=8|title=Monaghan Anti-Divorce Meeting|date=23 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Anti-Divorce Campaign which unsuccessfully campaigned for a No vote in the [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|1995 divorce referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|page=5|date=31 August 1995|first=Carol|last=Coulter|title=Opponents of divorce prepare campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=25 January 1995|page=32|title=Anti-Divorce Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; He warned that if it were to pass, people would be divorced against their will.

{{quote|author=Joe McCarroll|text=Does that mean that if one partner says there is such a prospect [no reasonable prospect of reconciliation], the court is then obliged to deny a divorce? If it doesn't mean that, then you have unilateral divorce against the will of the other person&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|page=12|date=16 September 1995|title=This Week They Said}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The referendum was passed by a slim margin, and after an unsuccessful court challenge by Des Hanafin, was signed into law in June 1996.&lt;ref name="it58604"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/result-of-divorce-referendum-is-formally-signed-by-high-court-1.58604|title=Result of divorce referendum is formally signed by High Court|last=Newman|first=Christine|date=15 June 1996|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abortion==
{{see also|Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|Pro Life Campaign}}

Joe McCarroll co-founded the [[Pro Life Campaign]] in 1992, and was its chairman until December 2015. He was active in the PLC, giving opening and closing statements at seminars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=249458441746276353|user=CoraSherlock|title=Opening remarks by Dr Joe McCarroll, Chair of Pro Life Campaign at start of national seminar #plc2012|date=22 September 2012|author-link=Cora Sherlock}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prolifecampaign.ie/main/our-work/our-people/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172645/http://prolifecampaign.ie/main/our-work/our-people/|archive-date=29 April 2015|quote=Dr. Joseph McCarroll is Chairperson of the Pro Life Campaign.He is also an author and social commentator.|title=Our People|publisher=Pro Life Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=249500404763734016|user=CoraSherlock|title=Dr Joe McCarroll giving closing address at #plc2012 after a very successful seminar.|author-link=Cora Sherlock|date=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=717817162191282178|user=CoraSherlock|author-link=Cora Sherlock|title=@daithigorman What?

===2002 Abortion referendum===
{{See also|Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2002 (Ireland)}}

While chairman of the Pro Life Campaign he called for a 'yes' vote in the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2002 (Ireland)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=The Irish Times|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/chairman-urges-hard-work-to-ensure-yes-vote-1.1051319|date=22 February 2002|first=Lorna|last=Siggins|title=Chairman urges hard work to ensure Yes vote}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was rejected by the people in the vote. He said the proposed amendment was "not anti-woman" and would "put the unborn on the social radar screen" so that women with an unexpected pregnancy could be supported, and that the amendment would provide a very good barrier against "anyone smuggling in abortion and describing it as medical treatment."

==LGBT rights==
In 1993, as national secretary of [[Family Solidarity]], he campaigned against the [[LGBT rights in the Republic of Ireland#Law regarding same-sex sexual activity|decriminalisation of homosexuality]], calling it "unnatural",.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|page=4|date=23 April 1993|title=The case against homosexual law reform|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1993/0423/Pg012.html|last=McCarroll|first=Joseph}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, in the lead up to the [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|marriage equality referendum]], he campaigned against it, and called for a no vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Broadsheet.ie|url=http://www.broadsheet.ie/2015/05/12/slippery-slope-1993/|title=Slippery Slope, 1993|date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He has a PhD.

}}'''Juan Luis Manzur''' (born January 8, 1969) is an Argentine surgeon and politician. He served as Minister of Health and Environment of Argentina from 2009 to 2015, and is currently the Governor of [[Tucumán Province]].

==Biography==
Manzur was born in [[San Miguel de Tucumán]] to a [[Maronite Catholic]] father from [[Lebanon]] and an Argentine mother. He received a [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] from the [[University of Tucumán]] and completed his [[medical residency|residency]] at the public Álvarez Hospital, in [[Buenos Aires]]. Manzur later received a master's degree in Health Systems and Services Administration from the [[University of Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/06/30/elpais/p-01949148.htm|title=Un médico sanitarista tucumano reemplazará a Ocaña en Salud|work=Clarín}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following a stint as Vice Minister of Health for the [[Province of San Luis]], in 2002 he was named Public Health Secretary of the [[La Matanza Partido|District of La Matanza]], a western, mainly blue-collar suburb of the Argentine capital. Recommended by the National Health Minister, [[Ginés González García]], Manzur was appointed Health Minister of [[Tucumán Province]] by the new Governor, [[José Alperovich]], in 2003. Manzur soon earned plaudits in his post, which oversaw public health in one of Argentina's least-developed provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/08/13/sociedad/s-05806.htm|title=Se redujo la tasa de mortalidad infantil|work=Clarín}}&lt;/ref&gt; One widely used yardstick of public health, the [[infant mortality rate]], fell from 23 per 1,000 births (40% above the national average) in 2003, to 13 in 2006 (matching the national average).&lt;ref name=deis05&gt;[http://www.deis.gov.ar/publicaciones/archivos/indicadores%202005.pdf DEIS: indicadores básicos, 2005 (2003 data)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626212822/http://www.deis.gov.ar/publicaciones/archivos/indicadores%202005.pdf |date=2007-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deis.gov.ar/publicaciones/archivos/Boletín121.pdf DEIS: Boletín 121 (2007 data)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711000913/http://www.deis.gov.ar/publicaciones/archivos/Bolet%C3%ADn121.pdf |date=2009-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[perinatal mortality]] rate (a late fetal death, or of an infant under one week old) likewise fell during the same period in Tucumán from 24 to 18 per 1,000 births.&lt;ref name=deis05/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deis.gov.ar/publicaciones/archivos/indicadores_2008.pdf DEIS: indicadores básicos, 2008 (2006 data)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521083147/http://www.deis.gov.ar/publicaciones/archivos/indicadores_2008.pdf |date=2009-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These news helped Manzur secure Governor Alperovich's nod to be a running mate for his successful, 2007 bid for re-election.

Manzur was sworn in on July 1, the day after a public health emergency was declared over a worsening [[H1N1]] virus ("swine flu") [[2009 flu pandemic in Argentina|epidemic]], which had claimed 44 fatalities by the time he was sworn in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1145700&amp;pid=6786658&amp;toi=6256|title=Destinan mil millones de pesos para combatir la gripe A|work=La Nación''}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tenure would thereafter be focused on expanding [[childhood immunizations]], childhood [[preventive medicine]], diagnostic care against [[coeliac disease]] and [[HPV]], [[mobile health]], access to [[organ transplant]]s, and [[smoking cessation]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rionegro.com.ar/diario/vacunaron-al-86-de-grupos-vulnerables-1039508-9574-nota.aspx|title=Vacunaron al 86% de grupos vulnerables|work=Río Negro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavoz.com.ar/ciudadanos/argentina-2012-marco-nuevo-record-donacion-trasplantes|title=Argentina: 2012 marcó un nuevo récord en donación y trasplantes|work=La Voz del Interior}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staunch opposition from the powerful [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Church-state relations in Argentina|Argentina]] forced Manzur to reverse steps toward protecting women's [[reproductive rights]], cancelling proposals in 2010 that would have guarantee access to [[Abortion in Argentina|legal abortions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/08/16/argentina-says-dont-cry-about-unsafe-abortion/|title=Argentina Says “Don’t Cry” About Unsafe Abortion|work=Ms.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He stepped down as Health Minister in February 2015 to return to the post of Vice Governor of Tucumán, and was expected to run to succeed Governor Alperovich in [[Argentine general election, 2015|provincial elections later in the year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buenosairesherald.com/article/183034/electoral-politics-in-provinces-are-behind-reshuffle|title=Electoral politics in provinces are behind reshuffle|work=Buenos Aires Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3424">'''Lime softening''', also known as [[Thomas Clark (chemist)|Clark]]'s process,&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, J W, Intermediate Inorganic Chemistry, Longmans, Green &amp; Co, London, 1941, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[water treatment]] used for [[water softening]] which uses the addition of [[limewater]] ([[calcium hydroxide]]) to remove [[Hard water|hardness]] ([[calcium]] and [[magnesium]]) [[ion]]s by [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]]. The process is also effective at removing a variety of [[microorganism]]s and dissolved [[organic matter]] by [[flocculation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/water/publications/reportpdfs/Primer%20Files/07%20-%20Lime%20Softening.pdf USBR - Lime Softening fact sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613145622/http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/water/publications/reportpdfs/Primer%20Files/07%20-%20Lime%20Softening.pdf |date=2011-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lime softening was first used in 1841 to treat [[River Thames|Thames River]] water. The process expanded in use as the [[Bactericide|bactericidal]] effect of the process was discovered. Lime softening greatly expanded in use during the early 1900s as industrial water use expanded. Lime softening provides soft water that can, in some cases, be used more effectively for heat transfer and various other industrial uses.

==Chemistry==

As lime in the form of [[limewater]] is added to raw water, the pH is raised and the equilibrium of [[carbonate]] species in the water is shifted. Dissolved [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is changed into [[bicarbonate]] (HCO{{su|p=−|b=3}}) and then carbonate (CO{{su|p=2-|b=3}}). This action causes [[calcium carbonate]] to precipitate due to exceeding the solubility product. Additionally, magnesium can be precipitated as [[magnesium hydroxide]] in a [[double displacement]] reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lime Softening|url=http://water.me.vccs.edu/concepts/softeninglime.html|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the process both the calcium (and to an extent magnesium) in the raw water as well as the calcium added with the lime are  precipitated. This is in contrast to [[ion exchange]] softening where [[sodium]] is exchanged for calcium and magnesium ions. In lime softening, there is a substantial reduction in [[total dissolved solids]] (TDS) whereas in ion exchange softening (sometimes referred to as [[zeolite]] softening), there is no significant change in the level of TDS.

Lime softening can also be used to remove [[iron]], [[manganese]], [[radium]] and [[arsenic]] from water.

==Future uses==
Lime softening is now often combined with newer membrane processes to reduce waste streams. Lime softening can be applied to the concentrate (or reject stream) of membrane processes, thereby providing a stream of substantially reduced hardness (and thus TDS), that may be used in the finished stream. Also, in cases with very hard source water (often the case in Midwestern USA [[ethanol]] production plants), lime softening can be used to pre-treat the membrane feed water.

==Waste products==
Lime softening produces large volumes of a mixture of calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide in a very finely divided white precipitate which may also contain some organic matter flocculated out of the raw water. Processing or disposal of this material may be a cost to the process.

'''Mellin's Food Company''' was a maker of '''Mellin's Food for Infants and Invalids''' in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

==History==
The company started when the English food chemist [[Gustav Mellin]] developed an [[infant formula]] in 1866.&lt;ref name ="Oxford"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Andrew Smith |title= |year=2013  |publisher= |page= |encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOJMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mellin's formula was a simplified version of one which had been recently invented by the German chemist [[Justus von Liebig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brock |first=William H |date=1997 |title=Justus Von Liebig: The Chemical Gatekeeper |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VugoemP2th0C&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=Mellin%27s+Food+Liebig&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M78aVe41E0&amp;sig=DgdPHQzcPIMZmlGkEyxa8lz7dQg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwid2r_PkOHTAhWBDcAKHS0XBvoQ6AEIWTAO#v=onepage&amp;q=Mellin's%20Food%20Liebig&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=247 |isbn=0-521-56224-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't a total nutritional supplement, the powder was diluted with [[cow's milk]] and water and was called a "milk modifier".&lt;ref name ="Oxford"/&gt; It was a "soluble, dry extract of wheat, [[malted barley]] and [[bicarbonate of potassium]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jacqueline H.

The '''Palo Alto Mental Research Institute''' (MRI) is one of the founding institutions of [[Brief psychotherapy|brief]] and [[family therapy]].&lt;ref name="Nichols, M. 2005"&gt;Nichols, M., &amp; Schwartz, R. (2005). ''Family Therapy: Concepts and Methods'' (7th Edition), New York City: [[Prentice Hall]].&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by [[Don D. Jackson]] and colleagues in 1958, MRI has been one of the leading sources of ideas in the area of interactional/systemic studies, [[psychotherapy]], and family therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Weakland, J., &amp; Ray, W. (1995). ''Propagations: Thirty years of Influence from the Mental Research Institute'', New York: [[Haworth Press|Haworth]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
According to an article in the ''Psychotherapy Networker'' on [[Jay Haley]] (a  Research Associate at MRI in the 1960s) MRI "became the go-to place for any therapist who wanted to be on the cutting edge of psychotherapy research and practice. Fostering a climate of almost untrammeled experimentalism, MRI started the first formal training program in family therapy, produced some of the seminal early papers and books in the field, and became a place where some of the field's leading figures - [[Paul Watzlawick]], [[Richard Fisch]], Jules Riskin, [[Virginia Satir]], [[Salvador Minuchin]], [[R.D. Laing]], [[Irvin D. Yalom]], [[Cloe Madanes]] - came to work or just hang out".&lt;ref&gt;''Psychotherapy Networker'', November/December, 2007, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the Brief Therapy Center at MRI presented an innovative model for the comprehensive approach to brief psychotherapy, a model which, in turn, has influenced subsequent brief therapy approaches  throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Nichols, M. 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/us/15watzlawick.html Paul Watzlawick, Therapist Behind Rapid Diagnosis Strategy, Dies at 85 - [[New York Times]]&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Brief Therapy Center at MRI was founded by Dick Fisch, [[John Weakland]], and [[Paul Watzlawick]]. Continuing applied research and theory development have expanded the use of interactional concepts to community, school and business. Thousands of professionals within the U.S. as well as from many countries of the world have attended MRI training programs.&lt;ref&gt;[[www.mri.org MRI website]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mirth Connect''' also known as ''Nextgen Connect'' is a cross-platform [[Health_Level_7|HL7]] interface engine that enables bi-directional sending of HL7 messages between systems and applications over multiple transports available under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) 1.1 license. On September 9th, 2013 Mirth Corporation announced they were acquired by [[Quality Systems]].&lt;ref name="ACQUIRED"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirthcorp.com/news/quality-systems-acquires-mirth-corporation|title=Quality Systems, Inc. Acquires Mirth Corporation|date=2013-09-09|accessdate=2013-09-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923122839/http://www.mirthcorp.com/news/quality-systems-acquires-mirth-corporation|archivedate=2013-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. MirthConnect has since been rebranded as NextgenConnect &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nextgen.com/products-and-services/integration-engine&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Background==
Mirth Connect uses a channel-based architecture to connect [[Health_information_technology|HIT]] systems and allow messages to be filtered, transformed, and routed based on user-defined rules. Channels consist of connectors (both inbound and outbound), filters, and transformers. Multiple filters and a chain of transformers can be associated with a channel.

Endpoints are used to configure connections and their protocol details. Source connectors are used to designate the type of listener to use for incoming messages, such as TCP/IP or a web service. Destination connectors are used to designate the destination of outgoing messages, such as an application server, a JMS queue, or a database. All messages and transactions are optionally logged to an internal database. Mirth Connect can be also configured to auto-generate an HL7 acknowledgement response (ACK). 

==Connector varieties==
Mirth Connect supports sending and receiving healthcare messages over a variety of protocols: 

* TCP/MLLP
* Database ([[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]], Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, ODBC)
* File (local file system and network shares)
* PDF and RTF documents
* [[Java_Message_Service|JMS]]
* FTP/SFTP
* [[HTTP]]
* [[SMTP]]
* [[SOAP]] (over HTTP) 

An open architecture allows for the easy addition of custom and legacy interfaces.

==Types of transforms==
* Mapping transformer: map data from incoming message to variables
* Script transformer: execute custom script on message (Ex. JavaScript, Python, Tcl)
* HL7 message generator: construct HL7 messages from data source
* XSLT transformer: run XSL Transformations on incoming HL7 v3 or XML encoded messages

==Adopters==
The [[Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology|Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology (CCHIT)]], in a push to ensure interoperability standards between electronic health records, has adopted [[Laika (EHR testing framework)|Laika]], an open source standards software program. At the 2009 Annual HIMSS Conference, Mirth was selected as one of the testing tools for the coming interoperability tests.&lt;ref name="45YRSLATER"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fredtrotter.com/category/himss/|title=Archive for the ‘HIMSS’ Category |publisher=Fred Trotter blog|date=2009-04-08| accessdate = 2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Day of Mourning''', or '''Workers’ Mourning Day''' is observed in [[Canada]] on 28 April. It commemorates workers who have been killed, injured or suffered illness due to workplace related hazards and occupational exposures.

Workers' Memorial Day was started when two labour activists, Colin Lambert and Dr. Ray Sentes, were driving in early April 1983 to a union meeting, and were stopped by a funeral procession for a firefighter that had been killed in the line of duty&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=BC Labour Heritage Centre|title=Day of Mourning The Untold Story (2017)|date=2017-04-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP0JvrXjmgo&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They worried that other workers who died because of work did not receive similar honours, and recalled how members of the United Steelworkers in Elliott Lake held each year a "Workers' Remembrance Day" for uranium miners who had succumbed to exposures. Lambert and Sentes sought endorsements from union officials for the idea to hold a national day of mourning, and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) passed a resolution to that effect at its annual convention in 1983, and the Canadian Labour Congress followed suit at its annual convention the following year. The AFL-CIO declared a day of mourning in 1989 and a "workers' Memorial Day" is observed in over 100 countries.

In December 1990, this day became a national observance in Canada with the passing of the Workers Mourning Day Act, so that on April 28, 1991, it was officially the National Day of Mourning for persons killed or injured in the workplace; making April 28, an official Workers’ Mourning Day.&lt;ref name="Manchester"&gt;[[Greater Manchester Hazards Centre]] Fact Sheet 28 April 2006 (GMHC is part of the [[Hazards Campaign]] recognised and affiliated to the UK [[Trades Union Congress]]) Author Hilda Palmer, (no ISBN); available at {{cite web |url=http://www.gmhazards.org.uk/WMDLft06.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518055811/http://www.gmhazards.org.uk/WMDLft06.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-18 |df= }} Also '''Safety Express' March/ April 2006 Page 5'' 'April 28th is...Workers' Memorial Day' (no ISBN); published by The [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]] ([[ROSPA]]) UK [[registered charity]] No. 207823&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ohs"&gt;TUC Certificate in Occupational Health &amp; Safety course notes 2004/5 Section C page 69 (no ISBN); more info available at {{cite web |url=http://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/index.cfm?mins=293 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217003146/http://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/index.cfm?mins=293 |archivedate=2010-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries and deaths in the workplace continue to be a matter of important concern across Canada. Many Canadians members work hard each day in an effort to minimize accidents and incidents.  Risk is an inherent element of many jobs, and this is why safety should be one of the core values in any workplace. Since its inception, the observance has spread to over 80 countries around the world, but is known is most other countries as the [[Workers' Memorial Day]]. The date 28 April was picked because on that day in 1914, the [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/workers-compensation/ Workers Compensation Act] received its third reading. In 2001 the [[International Labour Organization]] first observed World Day for Safety and Health at Work on this day.  Commemorating those who have been hurt or killed in the workplace shows respect for the fallen, while serving as a reminder of the importance of occupational health and safety.

The Canadian flag is flown at half-mast from sunrise to sunset on all federal government buildings, including on Parliament Hill. Workers and employees observe this day in various ways including lighting candles, donning ribbons and black armbands, and observing a moment of silence at 1100 hrs. The purpose of Day of Mourning is twofold- to remember and honour those lives lost or injured and to renew the commitment to improving health and safety in the workplace - to prevent further deaths, injuries and diseases from work.

==Young Workers==
Young workers aged from 15-24 are more likely than any other group to be injured on the job, in fact 1/3 of all injuries occur in this age group, and males are twice as likely to be injured as female workers.&lt;ref name="YoungStats"&gt;[[WorkSafeBC]] Young Workers Rights and Facts, http://www.labourheritagecentre.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/6-FactSheet-Bugged-Revision-3-.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest rate of injury happens in construction and hospitality industries. These rates have led to specific laws in many provinces that provide for additional and special training for young and new workers.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;[[WorkSafeBC]] Young Workers Resource and Fact Page, http://www2.worksafebc.com/Topics/YoungWorker/Home.asp.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these statistics, there has been renewed push to use this holiday to educate young workers of their rights in schools.&lt;ref name="Schools"&gt;Day of Mourning, BC Schools Project, http://www.labourheritagecentre.ca/domschoolsproject/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[File:Negative room.png|thumb|Schematic of a network of rooms where air (shown in blue) flows in one direction from the corridor into the negative pressure room (green). Exhaust air is safely removed from the area through a ventilation system.]]
[[vacuum|Negative pressure]] is generated and maintained by a ventilation system that removes more exhaust air from the room than air is allowed into the room. Air is allowed into the room through a gap under the door (typically about one half-inch high). Except for this gap, the room should be as airtight as possible, allowing no air in through cracks and gaps, such as those around windows, light fixtures and electrical outlets. Leakage from these sources can compromise or eliminate room negative pressure.&lt;ref name="camil"/&gt;

==Smoke test==
A [[smoke testing (mechanical)#Infectious disease control|smoke test]] can help determine whether a room is under negative pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc.state.mn.us/DocPolicy2/Document/500.522.htm Title: Negative Pressure Isolation Rooms], Minnesota Department of Corrections, Issue date 2007-07-03. Retrieved 2010-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  A tube containing smoke is held near the bottom of the negative pressure room door, about 2 inches in front of the door. The smoke tube is held parallel to the door, and a small amount of smoke is then generated by gently squeezing the bulb. Care is taken to release the smoke from the tube slowly to ensure the velocity of the smoke from the tube does not overpower the air velocity. If the room is at negative pressure, the smoke will travel under the door and into the room. If the room is not a negative pressure, the smoke will be blown outward or will stay stationary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2485">'''Polizeiwissenschaft''' ([[German language|German]] for "Police science", though "Polizei" may in this case be better translated as "Public Policy" or "Politics" in a broad sense) was a discipline born in the first third of the 18th century which lasted until the middle of the 19th century. 

Considered as the science of the internal order of the community, it was a comprehensive term, which included today's [[public law]], [[Administration (business)|administrative]] science, the early [[political economy]], [[public health]] concerns, [[urbanism]] and [[urban planning]] (important in the light of the [[miasma theory of disease]]), etc. It overlapped with the simultaneously used term of ''Verwaltungswissenschaft'' (or "administrative science") and was a university course included in official trainings. 

The first instruction chairs for "Cameralia Oeconomica and Polizeiwissenschaft" were created in 1727 by [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt]].One of the ''Polizeiwissenschaft'' first practitioners was [[Johann Friedrich von Pfeiffer]] born in Berlin and was a leading exponent of the theory on economic sustainability. ''Polizeiwissenschaft'' was quite distinct from today's use of the term "[[police]]", which is strictly reserved for law enforcement activities. It included "''Marktpolizei''" ("market police"), concerned with the surveillance of [[prices]] and economical activity, "''Gewerbeaufsicht''" ("surveillance of trade"), "''Bauaufsicht''" ("construction supervision") and "''Ausländerpolizei''" ("Foreigners' police"). 

The term has recently been used in a sense more closely related to contemporary police activities, used both as a comprehensive term as a synonym of "[[police science]]s" (including [[jurisprudence]], [[criminology]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[political science]], [[forensics]], etc.).

This concept does not refer to animal or plant populations. It has been described as consisting of three components. These are "health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and [[Population health policies and interventions|policies and interventions]]".&lt;ref name="pmid12604476" /&gt;  A priority considered important in achieving the aim of Population Health is to reduce health inequities or disparities among different population groups due to, among other factors, the [[social determinants of health]], SDOH. The SDOH include all the factors (social, environmental, cultural and physical) that the different populations are born into, grow up and function with throughout their lifetimes which potentially have a measurable impact on the health of human populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=39 Social Determinants of Health overview tab.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Population Health concept represents a change in the focus from the individual-level, characteristic of most mainstream [[medicine]]. It also seeks to complement the classic efforts of [[public health]] agencies by addressing a broader range of factors shown to impact the health of different populations. The World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health, reported in 2008, that the SDOH factors were responsible for the bulk of diseases and injuries and these were the major causes of health inequities in all countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/sdhconference/resources/Conference_Report.pdf Meeting Report of World Conference of Social Determinants of Health] held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, SDOH were estimated to account for 70% of avoidable mortality.&lt;ref&gt;McGinnis JM, Williams-Russo P, Knickman JR. 2002.

==Healthy People 2020==

Healthy People 2020 is a web site sponsored by the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]], representing the cumulative effort of 34 years of interest by the Surgeon General's office and others. It identifies 42 topics considered [[social determinants of health]] and approximately 1200 specific goals considered to improve population health. It provides links to the current research available for selected topics and identifies and supports the need for community involvement considered essential to address these problems realistically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx Health People 2020]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The human role of economic inequality==

Recently, human role has been encouraged by the influence of population growth there has been increasing interest from [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] on the subject of [[economic inequality]] and its relation to the health of populations. There is a very robust correlation between [[Social status|socioeconomic status]] and health. This correlation suggests that it is not only the poor who tend to be sick when everyone else is healthy,  [[heart disease]], [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]], [[type 2 diabetes]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], certain types of [[cancer]], and [[premature aging]]. Despite the reality of the [[Socioeconomic status#health|SES Gradient]], there is debate as to its cause. A number of researchers (A. Leigh, C. Jencks, A. Clarkwest—see also Russell Sage working papers) see a definite link between economic status and mortality due to the greater economic resources of the better-off, but they find little correlation due to [[social status]] differences.

Other researchers such as [[Richard G. Wilkinson]], J. Lynch, and G.A. Kaplan have found that socioeconomic status strongly affects health even when controlling for economic resources and access to health care. Most famous for linking social status with health are the [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall studies]]—a series of studies conducted on [[civil servants]] in [[London]]. The studies found that, despite the fact that all civil servants in England have the same access to health care, there was a strong correlation between social status and health. The studies found that this relationship stayed strong even when controlling for health-affecting habits such as [[exercise]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]]. Furthermore, it has been noted that no amount of medical attention will help decrease the likelihood of someone getting [[type 1 diabetes]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]]—yet both are more common among populations with lower socioeconomic status. Lastly, it has been found that amongst the wealthiest quarter of countries on earth (a set stretching from [[Luxembourg]] to [[Slovakia]]) there is no relation between a country's wealth and general population health{{ref|sci_amer_dec_2005}}—suggesting that past a certain level, absolute levels of wealth have little impact on population health, but relative levels within a country do.
The concept of [[psychosocial stress]] attempts to explain how psychosocial phenomenon such as [[Social status|status]] and [[social stratification]] can lead to the many diseases associated with the [[SES gradient]]. Higher levels of economic inequality tend to intensify social hierarchies and generally degrades the quality of social relations—leading to greater levels of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and stress related diseases. Richard Wilkinson found this to be true not only for the poorest members of society, but also for the wealthiest. Economic inequality is bad for everyone's health.''' 
Inequality does not only affect the health of human populations. David H. Abbott at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center found that among many primate species, less egalitarian social structures correlated with higher levels of stress hormones among socially subordinate individuals. Research by [[Robert Sapolsky]] of [[Stanford University]] provides similar findings.

==Research==
There is well-documented variation in health outcomes and health care utilization &amp; costs by geographic variation in the U.S., down to the level of Hospital Referral Regions (defined as a regional health care market, which may cross state boundaries, of which there are 306 in the U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chandra, A |author2=Skinner, JS | title= Geography and Racial Health Disparities, Chapter 16 of Critical Perspectives on Racial and Ethnic Differences in Health in Late Life. |year=2004|publisher=National Research Council|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6555551.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/data/region/| title=Data by Region, the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is ongoing debate as to the relative contributions of race, gender, poverty, education level and place to these variations. The Office of Epidemiology of the [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]] recommends using an analytic approach (Fixed Effects or hybrid Fixed Effects) to research on health disparities to reduce the confounding effects of neighborhood (geographic) variables on the outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Schempf, AH, Kaufman, JS | title= Accounting for context in studies of health inequalities: a review and comparison of analytic approaches. | journal=Annals of Epidemiology |volume=10| issue= 10 | year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2012.06.105 | pmid= 22858050 | pages=683–690| url= https://zenodo.org/record/1258734 | type= Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The importance of family planning programs==
[[Family planning]] programs (including [[Birth control|contraceptives]], [[sex education|sexuality education]], and promotion of [[safe sex]]) play a major role in population health. Family planning is one of the most highly cost-effective interventions in medicine.&lt;ref name=Tsui&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsui AO, McDonald-Mosley R, Burke AE |title=Family planning and the burden of unintended pregnancies |journal=Epidemiol Rev |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=152–74 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20570955 |pmc=3115338 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxq012 |url= | quote=International studies confirm that family planning is among the most cost-effective of all health interventions (80, 81). The cost savings stem from a reduction in unintended pregnancy, as well as a reduction in transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- page 170 --&gt;  Family planning saves lives and money by reducing [[unintended pregnancy]] and the transmission of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.&lt;ref name=Tsui /&gt;

==Population health management (PHM)==
One method to improve population health is population health management (PHM), which has been defined as "the technical field of endeavor which utilizes a variety of individual, organizational and cultural interventions to help improve the [[morbidity]] patterns (i.e., the illness and injury burden) and the health care use behavior of defined populations".&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, Michael.

Retrieved 12 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; PHM is distinguished from [[Disease management (health)|disease management]] by including more [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] conditions and diseases, by use of "a single point of contact and coordination", and by "[[predictive modeling]] across multiple clinical conditions".&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Rufus, and Christopher Spence.

== Healthcare reform and population health ==
Healthcare reform is driving change to traditional hospital reimbursement models. Prior to the introduction of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)]], hospitals were reimbursed based on the volume of procedures through [[fee-for-service]] models. Under the PPACA, reimbursement models are shifting from volume to value. New reimbursement models are built around [[Pay for performance (healthcare)|pay for performance]], a value-based reimbursement approach, which places financial incentives around patient outcomes and has drastically changed the way US hospitals must conduct business to remain financially viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Revised Medicare ACO Program: More Options … And More Work Ahead|url = http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/06/16/the-revised-medicare-aco-program-more-options-and-more-work-ahead/|website = Health Affairs|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to focusing on improving patient experience of care and reducing costs, hospitals must also focus on improving the health of populations (IHI Triple Aim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The IHI Triple Aim|url = http://www.ihi.org/engage/initiatives/TripleAim/Pages/default.aspx|website = www.ihi.org|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

As participation in value-based reimbursement models such as [[accountable care organization]]s (ACOs) increases, these initiatives will help drive population health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=DeVore S, Champion RW |title=Driving Population Health Through Accountable Care Organizations|journal=Health Affairs |year=2011|volume=30|issue=1|pages=41–50|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0935|pmid=21209436|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/30/1/41.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ACO model, hospitals have to meet specific quality benchmarks, focus on prevention, and carefully manage patients with chronic diseases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accountable Care Organizations, Explained|url = http://khn.org/news/aco-accountable-care-organization-faq/|website = Kaiser Health News|accessdate = 21 November 2015|language = en-US|date = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providers get paid more for keeping their patients healthy and out of the hospital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Studies have shown that inpatient admission rates have dropped over the past ten years in communities that were early adopters of the ACO model and implemented population health measures to treat "less sick" patients in the outpatient setting.&lt;ref&gt;Kutscher B.

Hospitals are finding it financially advantageous to focus on population health management and keeping people in the community well.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Population Health Management: Hospitals' Changing Employer Role|url = http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce-labor-management/population-health-management-hospitals-changing-employer-role.html|website = www.beckershospitalreview.com|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of population health management is to improve patient outcomes and increase health capital. Other goals include preventing disease, closing care gaps, and cost savings for providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Population Health Management?|url = http://www.wellcentive.com/what-is-population-health-management/|website = Wellcentive|accessdate = 21 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last few years, more effort has been directed towards developing telehealth services, community-based clinics in areas with high proportion of residents using the emergency department as primary care, and patient care coordinator roles to coordinate healthcare services across the care continuum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The economics of health and health care (Vol. 6): Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as obesity and smoking have negative effects on health capital, while education, wage rate, and age may also impact health capital.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When people are healthier through preventative care, they have the potential to live a longer and healthier life, work more and participate in the economy, and produce more based on the work done. These factors all have the potential to increase earnings. Some states, like New York, have implemented statewide initiatives to address population health. In New York state there are 11 such programs. One example is the Mohawk Valley Population Health Improvement Program (http://www.mvphip.org/). These programs work to address the needs of the people in their region, as well as assist their local community based organizations and social services to gather data, address health disparities, and explore evidence-based interventions that will ultimately lead to better health for everyone. Following a similar approach, Cullati et al. developed a theoretical framework for the development and onset of vulnerability in later life based on the concept of "reserves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullati|first=Stéphane|last2=Kliegel|first2=Matthias|last3=Widmer|first3=Eric|date=2018|title=Development of reserves over the life course and onset of vulnerability in later life|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=2|issue=8|pages=551–558|doi=10.1038/s41562-018-0395-3|issn=2397-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages to use the concept of reserves in interdisciplinary studies, as compared with related concepts such as resources and capital, is to strengthen the importance of constitution and sustainability of reserves (the “use it or lose it” paradigm) and the presence of thresholds, below which functioning becomes challenging.

'''Seva Foundation''' is an international non-profit health organization based in [[Berkeley, California]] known for preventing and treating blindness and other [[visual impairment]]s. It was co-founded in 1978 by Dr. [[Larry Brilliant]], [[Ram Dass]], [[Wavy Gravy]], [[Nicole Grasset]] and [[Govindappa Venkataswamy]]. [[Steve Jobs]] served as an early adviser and major contributor.

Seva works with local communities in more than 20 countries around the world to develop locally-run, culturally appropriate, self-sustaining programs to increase access to eye care. Seva works with local eye health hospitals and clinics in central Asia, southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The foundation also works with Native communities in North America through its [[Seva Foundation#American Indian Sight Initiative|American Indian Sight Initiative]].

A '''Sexual Attitude Reassessment''', sometimes '''Sexual Attitude Restructuring''' ('''SAR'''), seminar is a process-oriented, structured group experience to promote participants' awareness of their attitudes and values related to sexuality, and to assist them in understanding how these attitudes and values affect them professionally and personally. Since the primary purpose of a SAR is the examination of attitudes and values, it is not a traditional academic experience designed to disseminate [[cognitive]] information, nor is it [[psychotherapy]] directed toward the resolution of personal problems.

A SAR provides an opportunity for participants to explore and understand their beliefs, attitudes, values and biases within the realm of sex and sexuality.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} This self-exploration and self-understanding facilitates comfort that ultimately fosters improved communication skills, both on a professional and a personal level.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

By becoming increasingly aware of their perceptions, beliefs, and feelings, participants become increasingly comfortable with the wide variation of existing sexual attitudes, behaviours, practices, and even sub-cultures.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web|author=APA Council of Representatives|title=Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Clients|url=https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/amp-a0024659.pdf|website=APA|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comfort is necessary for sexual health professionals, and is also beneficial for individuals striving for personal growth and the development of healthy personal relationships.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

During a SAR, participants examine [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and sexual attitudes from numerous perspectives using a variety of images. The nature of a SAR requires that some of the media be explicit. The use of explicit media is necessary for increasing [[self-awareness]] and personal comfort with the many areas of sex and sexuality. In addition to the personal growth, the event involves small group discussions during which participants are challenged with the opportunity to practice their professional or [[interpersonal skills]].

Generally it appears as a white patch, located at the point where the tobacco is held in the mouth. The condition usually disappears once the tobacco habit is stopped. It is associated with slightly increased risk of [[mouth cancer]].

==Background==
There are many types of smokeless tobacco. [[Chewing tobacco]] is shredded, air-cured tobacco with flavoring. [[Dipping tobacco]] ("moist snuff") is air or fire-cured, finely cut tobacco. [[Dry snuff]] is ground or pulverised tobacco leaves. In the Indian subcontinent, the Middle-East and South-East Asia, tobacco may be combined in a [[Chewing tobacco|quid]] or [[paan]] with other ingredients such as [[betel]] leaf, [[Areca nut]] and [[slaked lime]].&lt;ref name=Neville2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eversole2011&gt;{{cite book|author=Eversole LR|title=Clinical Outline of Oral Pathology: Diagnosis and Treatment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0ng2f1hxn4C&amp;pg=PA16|year=2011|publisher=PMPH-USA|isbn=978-1-60795-015-8|pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of Areca nut is associated with [[oral submucous fibrosis]].&lt;ref name=Neville2008 /&gt; An appearance termed '''Betel chewer's mucosa''' describes [[morsicatio buccarum]] with red-staining of mucosa due to betel quid ingredients.&lt;ref name=Neville2008 /&gt; In Scandinavian countries, [[snus]], a variant of dry snuff, is sometimes used.&lt;ref name=Werning2011 /&gt; In the United States of America, the most common form of smokeless tobacco is dipping tobacco, although chewing tobacco is sometimes used by outdoor workers and dry snuff is common among females in the Southern states.&lt;ref name=Neville2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Werning2011 /&gt; The overall prevalence of smokeless tobacco use in the USA is about 4.5%, but this is higher in Mid-Western and Southern states.&lt;ref name=Neville2008 /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
STK typically occurs in the buccal sulcus (inside the cheek) or the labial sulcus (between the lips and the teeth) and corresponds to the site where the tobacco is held in the mouth.&lt;ref name=Werning2011&gt;{{cite book|author=Werning JW|title=Oral Cancer: Diagnosis, Management, and Rehabilitation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JuJSf8kTsqUC&amp;pg=PA13|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Thieme|isbn=978-1-60406-485-8|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is painless.&lt;ref name=Laskaris2011 /&gt;

The appearance of the lesion is variable depending upon the type of tobacco used, and the frequency and duration of use.&lt;ref name=Werning2011 /&gt; It takes about 1-5 years of smokeless tobacco use for the lesion to appear.&lt;ref name=Laskaris2011&gt;{{cite book|author=Laskaris G|title=Treatment of Oral Diseases: A Concise Textbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GRmfM9dv0vYC&amp;pg=PA167|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Thieme|isbn=978-3-13-161371-4|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early lesions may appear as thin, translucent and granular or wrinkled mucosa.&lt;ref name=Ibsen2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Werning2011 /&gt; The later lesion may appear thicker, more opaquely white and [[hyperkeratosis|hyperkeratotic]] with fissures and folds.&lt;ref name=Werning2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ibsen2014 /&gt; Oral snuff causes more pronounced changes in the oral mucosa than tobacco chewing.&lt;ref name=Scully2013 /&gt; Snuff dipping is associated more with verrucous keratosis.&lt;ref name=Scully2013 /&gt;

As well as the white changes of the oral mucosa, there may be [[gingival recession]] (receding gums) and staining of tooth roots in the area where the tobacco is held.&lt;ref name=Laskaris2011 /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{See also|Leukoplakia#Differential diagnosis of an oral white patch}}
Diagnosis is mainly clinical, based on the history and clinical appearance. The [[differential diagnosis]] includes other oral white lesions such as [[Leukoplakia]], [[squamous cell carcinoma]], [[oral candidiasis]], [[lichen planus]], [[white sponge nevus]] and [[contact stomatitis]].&lt;ref name=Laskaris2011 /&gt; In contrast to pseudomembraneous candidiasis, this white patch cannot be wiped off.&lt;ref name=Laskaris2011 /&gt; [[Tissue biopsy]] is sometimes carried out to rule out other lesions, although biopsy is not routinely carried out for this condition.&lt;ref name=Petruzzelli2008 /&gt;

==Treatment==
Apart from stopping the habit, no other treatment is indicated.&lt;ref name=Scully2013 /&gt; Long term follow-up is usually carried out.&lt;ref name=Scully2013 /&gt; Some recommend biopsy if the lesions persists more than 6 weeks after giving up smokeless tobacco use,&lt;ref name=Laskaris2011 /&gt; or if the lesion undergoes a change in appearance (e.g. [[mouth ulcer|ulceration]], thickening, color changes, especially to speckled white and red or entirely red).&lt;ref name=Petruzzelli2008 /&gt; [[Surgical excision]] may be carried out if the lesion does not resolve.&lt;ref name=Laskaris2011 /&gt;

==Prognosis==
Usually this lesion is reversible if the tobacco habit is stopped completely,&lt;ref name=Werning2011 /&gt; even after many years of use.&lt;ref name=Scully2013 /&gt; In one report, 98% of lesions disappeared within 2 weeks of stopping tobacco use.&lt;ref name=Neville2008 /&gt; The risk of the lesion developing into oral cancer (generally [[squamous cell carcinoma]]&lt;ref name=Werning2011 /&gt; and its variant [[verrucous carcinoma]])&lt;ref name=Scully2013 /&gt; is relatively low.&lt;ref name=Greer2011 /&gt; Indeed, veruccous carcinoma is sometimes term '''snuff dipper's cancer'''.&lt;ref name=Neville2008 /&gt; In most reported cases, malignant transformation has occurring in individuals with a very long history of chewing tobacco or who use dry snuff.&lt;ref name=Werning2011 /&gt;

Smokeless tobacco use is also accompanied by increased risk of other oral conditions such as [[dental caries]] (tooth decay), [[periodontitis]] (gum disease), [[attrition (dental)|attrition]] (tooth wear) and staining.&lt;ref name=Ibsen2014 /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
STK is extremely common among smokeless tobacco users.&lt;ref name=Petruzzelli2008&gt;{{cite book|author=Petruzzelli GJ|title=Practical Head and Neck Oncology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JOEzBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA237|date=1 September 2008|publisher=Plural Publishing|isbn=978-1-59756-783-1|pages=237–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the association with smokeless tobacco use, this condition tends to occur in adults.&lt;ref name=Scully2013 /&gt; A national USA survey estimated an overall prevalence of 1.5% of all types of smokeless tobacco lesions, with males affected more commonly than females.&lt;ref name=Neville2008 /&gt;

A more pronounced appearance can occur with [[reverse smoking]], sometimes distinguished from stomatitis nicotina by the term '''reverse smoker's keratosis'''. While stomatitis nicotina that is caused by heat is not a premaligant condition (i.e. it does not carry an increased risk of transformation to [[oral cancer]]), the condition that is caused by reverse smoking is premalignant.&lt;ref name="Werning 2007" /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The palate may appear gray or white and contain many [[papule]]s or nodules that are slightly elevated with red dots in their center.&lt;ref name="Vellappally 2007" /&gt; These red dots represent the ducts of [[minor salivary glands]] which have become inflamed by heat.&lt;ref name="Werning 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Taybos 2008"&gt;{{cite web|author1=G Taybos |author2=K Crews |title=Oral Changes Associated with Tobacco Use|url=http://www.lsusd.lsuhsc.edu/Documents/TCI/TobaccoOralChanges0729081.pdf|publisher=The American Academy of Oral Medicine|accessdate=31 August 2013|date=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition is painless.&lt;ref name="Vellappally 2007" /&gt; If a [[denture]] is normally worn while smoking, then the mucosa underneath the denture appears unaffected by the condition.&lt;ref name="Bruch 2010" /&gt; In severe cases, the mucosa may show fissuring and develop a "dried lake bed" appearance.&lt;ref name="Bond's book of oral diseases" /&gt; Other changes associated with tobacco use may be evident such as brown or black extrinsic staining of teeth from tar and other components of tobacco smoke.&lt;ref name="Scully 2013" /&gt;

==Causes==
The cause of nicotine stomatitis is thought to be chemical or thermally induced [[keratosis]].&lt;ref name="Gnepp 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gnepp|first=Douglas R.|title=Diagnostic surgical pathology of the head and neck|year=2009|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9781437719512|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZapDKS55gMgC&amp;pg=PT1000&amp;lpg=PT1000&amp;dq=%22reverse+smoker's+palate%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mR15yRIx5Y&amp;sig=0PJredtD15oR6CYW_IkvN4_fYz4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GTIiUp2IJMGp7QbDuoGwCg&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22reverse%20smoker's%20palate%22&amp;f=false|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemicals in tobacco may act as irritants in this condition.&lt;ref name="Scully 2013" /&gt; Chronic heat exposure is also responsible. [[Pipe smoking]] produces more heat on the palate than any other forms of smoking. Long-term drinking of very hot [[beverage]]s can also cause a similar condition. The severity of the changes correlates with the frequency of the habit.&lt;ref name="Werning 2007" /&gt; The prevalence depends on a society's use of consuming hot beverages and of smoking in its various forms.

A similar, but more pronounced palatal keratosis occurs with reverse smoking. This is where the lit end of the cigar or cigarette is held in the mouth, another form of smoking associated with high levels of heat in the mouth.&lt;ref name="Werning 2007" /&gt; This form of the condition is sometimes termed "reverse smoker's keratosis",&lt;ref name="Bond's book of oral diseases" /&gt; and is a [[premalignant]] [[lesion]].&lt;ref name="Vellappally 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Werning 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Werning|first=John W.|title=Oral cancer : diagnosis, management, and rehabilitation|year=2007|publisher=Thieme|location=New York|isbn=9781588903099|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=91rbEvN2kqQC&amp;dq=%22reverse+smoker%27s+palate%22&amp;q=%22reverse+smoker%27s+palate%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22reverse%20smoker's%20palate%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the condition is associated with an increased risk of malignant transformation to oral [[squamous cell carcinoma]] (a type of [[oral cancer]]). Some sources do not distinguish between reverse smoker's keratosis and smoker's palate that is caused by heat.&lt;ref name="Scully 2013" /&gt; As such, these sources tend to state that stomatitis nicotina is a premalignant condition.&lt;ref name="Bruch 2010"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Treister NS, Bruch JM |title=Clinical oral medicine and pathology|year=2010|publisher=Humana Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60327-519-4|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reports show that there is an increased risk of [[tonsillar cancer]], [[lung cancer]] and tumors of the posterior oral cavity in people who develop stomatitis nicotina.&lt;ref name="Taybos 2008" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is normally made based upon the clinical appearance and history.&lt;ref name="Bruch 2010" /&gt; Tissue [[biopsy]] is not usually indicated unless there are areas of ulceration or localized [[erythroplakia]] (red patches).&lt;ref name="Bruch 2010" /&gt; The [[differential diagnosis]] is with other causes of white lesions (see [[leukoplakia#diagnosis|leukoplakia]] for a more complete discussion). Specific conditions which can produce a similar appearance include [[Darier's disease]],&lt;ref name="Scully 2013" /&gt; [[discoid lupus erythematosus]],&lt;ref name="Laskaris 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Laskaris|first=George|title=Pocket atlas of oral diseases|year=2006|publisher=Thieme|location=Stuttgart|isbn=9781588902498|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=flWDE5ftKkEC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%22reverse+smoker's+palate%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qKRdES_Onh&amp;sig=dUzu3cktj6Mni3YkBcHKwA5v11k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GTIiUp2IJMGp7QbDuoGwCg&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22reverse%20smoker's%20palate%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[oral candidiasis]],&lt;ref name="Laskaris 2006" /&gt; and [[oral lichen planus]].&lt;ref name="Laskaris 2006" /&gt;

If a biopsy is taken, the histopathologic appearance is one of [[hyperkeratosis]] and acanthosis.&lt;ref name="Bond's book of oral diseases" /&gt; There may be [[squamous metaplasia]] of excretory ducts, which results in the visible papules if the ducts become [[hyperplasia|hyperplastic]]. [[Neutrophil]]s may fill some ducts.&lt;ref name="Bond's book of oral diseases" /&gt; It is characterized as a "fissured" or "dried mud" appearance from excess [[keratin]] production by [[cell (biology)|cells]]. [[Dysplasia]] is rarely seen.&lt;ref name="Bond's book of oral diseases" /&gt;

==Treatment==
When the appearance is caused by heat, the lesion is usually completely reversible&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Werning 2007" /&gt; --&gt; within a few weeks&lt;ref name="Taybos 2008" /&gt; if the smoking habit is stopped.&lt;ref name="Vellappally 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Werning 2007" /&gt; This is the case even if the condition has been present for decades.&lt;ref name="Bond's book of oral diseases" /&gt;  Without stopping smoking, spontaneous remission of the lesion is unlikely.&lt;ref name="Scully 2013" /&gt; If the lesion persists despite stopping smoking, this is usually then considered to be a true leukoplakia rather than a reactionary keratotis,&lt;ref name="Bond's book of oral diseases" /&gt; and may trigger the decision to carry out a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Bruch 2010" /&gt; Since this condition almost always develops in the setting of long term heavy smoking, it usually indicates the need for regular observation&lt;ref name="Bruch 2010" /&gt; for cancers associated with smoking, e.g. lung cancer.

==Epidemiology==
The condition is uncommon.&lt;ref name="Scully 2013" /&gt;  It occurs usually in elderly males who have a history of heavy pipe smoking, but it also can occur in cigar or cigarette smokers.&lt;ref name="Taybos 2008" /&gt; The condition was once common, but has become more rare as habits such as pipe and cigar smoking have decreased in popularity.&lt;ref name="Bond's book of oral diseases"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frictional, Chemical, &amp; Thermal Keratosis, from Bond's Book of Oral Diseases, 4th Edition|url=http://www.maxillofacialcenter.com/BondBook/mucosa/keratosisfriction.html#f1|publisher=The Maxillofacial Center for Diagnostics &amp; Research|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodore Roosevelt Mason''' "'''T. R. M.'''" '''Howard''' (March 4, 1908 – May 1, 1976) was an American [[civil rights]] leader, [[fraternal organization]] leader, [[entrepreneur]] and [[surgeon]]. He was among the mentors to activists such as [[Medgar Evers]], [[Charles Evers]], [[Fannie Lou Hamer]], [[Amzie Moore]], [[Aaron Henry]], and [[Jesse Jackson]]; founded Mississippi's leading civil rights organization in the 1950s, the [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]];, and played a prominent role in the investigation of the kidnapping and murder of [[Emmett Till]] in the late 1950s. He was also president of the [[National Medical Association]], chairman of the board of the [[National Negro Business League]], and a leading national advocate of [[African-American businesses]].

==Early life and education==
Howard was born in 1908 in [[Murray, Kentucky]] to Arthur Howard, a tobacco twister, and Mary Chandler, a cook for Will Mason, a prominent local white doctor and member of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. Mason took note of the boy's work habits, talent, ambition, and charm. He put him to work in his hospital and eventually paid for much of his medical education. Howard later showed his gratitude by adding Mason as one of his middle names.

Howard attended three Adventist colleges: [[Oakwood University|Oakwood Junior College]], a [[historically black college]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]; the nearly all-white [[Union College (Nebraska)|Union College]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]]; and the College of Medical Evangelists (now [[Loma Linda University]]) in [[Loma Linda, California]]. While at Union College, he won the [[Anti-Saloon League]] of America's national contest for best orator in 1930.

During his years in medical school in California, Howard took part in civil rights and political causes and wrote a regular column for the ''[[California Eagle]]'', the main black newspaper of [[Los Angeles]]. He was also the president of the California Economic, Commercial, and Political League. Through the League and his columns, he championed black business ownership, the study of black history, and opposed local efforts to introduce segregation. 

In 1935, he married prominent black socialite Helen Nela Boyd; they were married 41 years. After a residency at [[Homer G. Phillips Hospital]] (in St. Louis, Missouri), Howard became the medical director of the [[Riverside Sanitarium]], the main Adventist health care institution to serve blacks.

==Career==
In 1942, Howard took over as the first chief surgeon at the hospital of the [[International Order of Twelve Knights and Daughters of Tabor]], a [[fraternal organization]], in the all-black town of [[Mound Bayou, Mississippi]]. While there, he founded an insurance company, restaurant, hospital, home construction firm, and a large farm where he raised cattle, quail, hunting dogs, and cotton. He also built a small zoo and a park as well as the first swimming pool for blacks in Mississippi. "In addition to his duties at the hospital, Howard operated a thriving private practice, where his specialties soon included the discreet provision of illegal [[abortion]]s (for both black and white patients), a practice he justified as a matter of both individual rights and [[family planning]]. (He also favored legalizing [[prostitution]], arguing that man's sinful nature made it impossible to suppress the sex trade.)"&lt;ref name=Reason/&gt;

In 1947, he broke with the Knights and Daughters, organized the rival United Order of Friendship, and opened the Friendship Clinic.

Howard rose to prominence as a civil rights leader after founding the [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]] (RCNL) in 1951. His compatriots in the League included [[Medgar Evers]], whom Howard had hired as an agent for his Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company, and [[Aaron Henry]], a future leader in the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]]. [[Arenia Mallory]], a principal and educator from the county seat [[Lexington, Mississippi]], was also on the board of directors of the RCNL. The RCNL mounted a successful boycott against service stations that denied restrooms to blacks and distributed twenty thousand bumper stickers with the slogan, "Don't Buy Gas Where You Can't Use the Restroom."

The RCNL organized yearly rallies in Mound Bayou for civil rights. Sometimes as many as ten thousand attended, including such future activists as [[Fannie Lou Hamer]] and [[Amzie Moore]]. Speakers included Rep. [[William L. Dawson (politician)|William L. Dawson]] of Chicago, Alderman [[Archibald Carey, Jr|Archibald J. Carey, Jr.]] of Chicago, Rep. [[Charles Diggs]] of [[Michigan]], and NAACP attorney [[Thurgood Marshall]]. One of the entertainers was [[Mahalia Jackson]].

In 1954, Howard hatched a plan to fight a credit squeeze by the [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens Councils]] against civil rights activists in Mississippi. At his suggestion, the NAACP under [[Roy Wilkins]] encouraged businesses, churches, and voluntary associations to transfer their accounts to the black-owned Tri-State Bank of Memphis. The funds were made available for loans to victims of the economic squeeze.

===Emmett Till===
{{Main|Emmett Till}}

Howard moved into the national limelight after the murder of [[Emmett Till]] in August 1955 and the trial of his killers, [[J. W. Milam]] and [[Roy Bryant]] in September. He delivered "[o]ne of the earliest and loudest denunciations of Till's murder," saying that if "the slaughtering of Negroes is allowed to continue, [[Mississippi]] will have a civil war. Negroes are only going to take so much."&lt;ref name=Reason&gt;{{cite web | last = Root | first = Damon | date = March 20, 2009 | url = http://reason.com/archives/2009/03/20/a-forgotten-civil-rights-hero | title = A Forgotten Civil Rights Hero | work = [[Reason magazine|Reason]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also deeply involved in the search for evidence in the case. He allowed his home to be a "black command center" for witnesses and journalists, including Clotye Murdock Larsson of ''[[Ebony magazine|Ebony]]'' magazine and Rep. [[Charles Diggs]].&lt;ref name=Reason/&gt; "Recognizing that local officials had little incentive to identify or punish every member of the conspiracy that took Till's life, he spearheaded a private investigation, personally helping to locate, interview, and protect several important witnesses."&lt;ref name=Reason/&gt;

Visitors noticed the high level of security, including armed guards and a plethora of weapons. Historians [[David T. Beito]] and [[Linda Royster Beito]] have written that Howard's residence "was so impregnable that journalists and politicians from a later era might have used the word 'compound' rather than 'home' to describe it."&lt;ref name=Reason/&gt; Howard evaded Mississippi's discriminatory [[gun control]] laws by hiding a pistol in a secret compartment of his car, and "slept with a [[Thompson submachine gun]] at the foot of his bed."&lt;ref name=MLK&gt;{{cite web | last = Root | first = Damon | date = January 19, 2011 | url = http://reason.com/blog/2011/01/19/martin-luther-king-civil-right | title = Martin Luther King, Civil Rights, and Armed Self-Defense | work = [[Reason magazine|Reason]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He brought Emmett's mother [[Mamie Till Bradley]] to the city from [[Chicago]] at his own expense, and she stayed at his home when she came to testify at the trial. Howard "escorted [Bradley] and various others to and from the courthouse in a heavily-armed caravan."&lt;ref name=MLK/&gt; Like many black journalists and political leaders, Howard alleged that more than two people took part in the crime.

After an [[all-white jury]] acquitted Milam and Bryant, Howard gave dozens of speeches around the country on the Till killing and other violence in Mississippi, typically to crowds of several thousand. One was to an overflow crowd on November 27 in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], at the [[Dexter Avenue Baptist Church]]. His host for the event was [[Martin Luther King Jr]]. and [[Rosa Parks]] was in the audience. Many years later, she singled out Howard's appearance as the "first mass meeting that we had in Montgomery" following Till's death. Four days after his speech, Parks made history by refusing to give her seat on a city bus in Montgomery to a white man, in violation of a city segregation ordinance.&lt;ref name=Reason/&gt;

Howard's speaking tour culminated in a rally for twenty thousand at [[Madison Square Garden]], where he was the featured speaker. He shared the stage with [[Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.]], [[A. Philip Randolph]], former First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and [[Autherine Lucy]].

In the final months of 1955, Howard and his family were increasingly subjected to death threats and economic pressure. He sold most of his property and moved permanently to Chicago. His national reputation as a civil rights leader still seemed secure. He also had a highly visible public dispute with [[J. Edgar Hoover]], Director of the FBI, whom he accused of being slow to find killers of blacks in the South.

In early 1956, the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' gave Howard the top spot on its annual national honor roll. He founded the Howard Medical Center on the South Side and served for one year as president of the [[National Medical Association]], the black counterpart of the AMA. Howard also became medical director of S.B. Fuller Products Company. [[Samuel B. Fuller]] was probably the wealthiest black man in the country at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Beito  | first=David T. | title=T.R.M. Howard: Thirty Years Later | url=http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/24570.html | work=History News Network | publisher=George Mason University | date=May 1, 2006 | accessdate=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Howard was unusual among prominent civil rights leaders because he strongly opposed socialism. He consistently praised the educator [[Booker T. Washington]], late president of the Tuskegee Institute, whom he regarded as a "towering genius" for his emphasis on self-help and entrepreneurship.  He "had little patience for the [[utopia]]n schemes of the far left, declaring at one point that he wished 'one bomb could be fashioned that would blow every [[Communism|Communist]] in America right back to [[Soviet Union|Russia]] where they belong.' In a similar vein, he said, 'There is not a thing wrong with [[Mississippi]] today that real [[Jeffersonian democracy]] and the [[Christianity|religion]] of [[Jesus Christ]] cannot solve'."&lt;ref name=Reason/&gt;

In 1958, Howard ran for Congress as a Republican against the powerful incumbent black Democrat, Rep. [[William L. Dawson (politician)|William L. Dawson]], a close ally of Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]]. Although he received much favorable media publicity, and support from leading black opponents of the Daley machine, Dawson overwhelmed him at the polls. Howard was unable to counter Dawson's efficient political organization, and rising voter discontent because of the economic recession and the reluctance of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to back the civil rights movement in the South..

Shortly before the election, Howard helped to found the Chicago League of Negro Voters. The League generally opposed the Daley organization and promoted the election of black candidates in both parties. It nurtured the black independent movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which eventually propelled four of Howard's friends to higher office: [[Ralph Metcalfe]], [[Charles Hayes (politician)|Charles Hayes]], and [[Gus Savage]] to Congress and [[Harold Washington]] as mayor.

In the two decades after the 1958 election, Howard had little role as a national leader but he remained important locally. He chaired a Chicago committee in 1965 to raise money for the children of the recently assassinated leader, [[Malcolm X]]. Later, he was an early contributor to the Chicago chapter of the SCLC's [[Operation Breadbasket]] under [[Jesse Jackson]]. In 1971, Operation [[Rainbow/PUSH|PUSH]] was founded in Howard's Chicago home, and he chaired the organization's finance committee.

===Friendship Medical Center===

In 1972, Howard founded the multimillion-dollar Friendship Medical Center on the South Side, the largest privately owned black clinic in Chicago. The staff of about one hundred and sixty included twenty-seven doctors in such fields as pediatrics, dental care, a pharmacy, ear, nose, and throat, and psychological and drug counseling. Friendship Medical Center fell into scandal when the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', along with the Better Government Association, investigated Chicago abortion practices. The ''Sun-Times'' reported the deaths of three Friendship Medical Center abortion patients, including one who died in 1973 after an abortion that her survivors alleged had been performed by Howard himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Pamela Zekman; Pamela Warrick | title=The Abortion Profiteers | url=http://media1.suntimes.com/multimedia/high021308.pdf_20080213_00_06_02_181.imageContent | work=The Chicago Sun-Times | date=November 12, 1978 | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829231758/http://media1.suntimes.com/multimedia/high021308.pdf_20080213_00_06_02_181.imageContent | archivedate=August 29, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Illinois Death Certificate No. C612195&lt;/ref&gt; Howard countered that the FMC had performed 1,500 legal abortions thus far, more than any other Illinois provider. Given such numbers, he concluded, only six major complications were not unusual. A lack of detailed comparative statistics makes it almost impossible to determine if he was right.  To Howard, the hue and cry was a smokescreen by the medical and political establishment to quash their lower-priced competitors. He had a basis for this belief. An abortion at the FMC cost about fifty dollars less than at hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Beito | first=David T. |author2=Beito,  Linda Royster  | title=T.R.M.

===Personal life===
During his years in Chicago, Howard's attention increasingly focused on big game hunting, and made several trips to Africa for this purpose. His Chicago mansion included a "safari room" filled with trophies that was often made available for public tours. His New Year's Eve parties, co-hosted by Helen Howard, were a regular stop for the Chicago's black social set. He also became well known as a leading abortion provider and was arrested in 1964 and 1965 but never convicted. Howard regarded this work as complementary to his earlier civil rights activism.

Howard died in Chicago on May 1, 1976 after many years of deteriorating health. The Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] officiated at the funeral.

'''The Retreat''', commonly known as the '''York Retreat''', is a place in England for the treatment of people with [[mental disorders|mental health needs]]. Located in [[Lamel Hill]] in [[York]], it operates as a [[Non-profit organisation|not for profit]] [[Charitable trust|charitable organisation]].

Opened in 1796, it is famous for having pioneered the so-called "[[moral treatment]]" that became a behaviour model for [[Psychiatric hospital|asylums]] around the world with mental health issues. Founded by [[William Tuke]], it was originally only for [[Quakers]] but gradually became open to everyone.&lt;ref name = "history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theretreatyork.org.uk/history/|title=Our History|publisher=The Retreat website|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It inspired other progressive facilities such as the US [[Brattleboro Retreat]], [[The Institute of Living|Hartford Retreat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shorter|first= Edward |title=A history of psychiatry: from the era of the asylum to the age of Prozac |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Oybg_APowMC&amp;pg=PP44|accessdate=18 December 2010 |year=1997 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-471-24531-5 |page=44 |quote=The Hartford Retreat was founded in 1824.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Friends Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;Kim Van Atta, David Roby, Ross Roby (1980) [http://www.friendshospitalonline.org/eventsaccount.htm An Account of the Events Surrounding the Origin of Friends Hospital &amp; A Brief Description of The Early Years of Friends Asylum 1817–1820].

Retrieved 8 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The present day The Retreat seeks to retain the essence of early "moral treatment", while applying the principles to a modern healthcare setting.&lt;ref name ="history"/&gt;

==History==

===Background===
The York Retreat developed from the English Quaker community both as a reaction against the harsh, inhumane treatment common to other asylums of that era, and as a model of Quaker therapeutic beliefs. A common belief at the time was that the mad were wild beasts.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, J. (2010). Inner night and inner light: A Quaker model of pastoral care for the mentally ill. Journal of Religion and Health, 49(4), 547–59. doi:10.1007/s10943-009-9312-4&lt;/ref&gt; The recommended medical practices included debilitating purges, painful blistering, long-term immobilisation by manacles, and sudden immersion in cold baths – all administered in regimes of fear, terror and brutality. But the Quakers maintained that the humanity and [[inner light]] of a person could never be extinguished.&lt;ref name="Charland2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Charland|first= L. |title=Benevolent theory: moral treatment at the York Retreat |journal=History of Psychiatry |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=61–80 |year=2007 |pmid=17580754 |doi=10.1177/0957154X07070320 |url=http://hpy.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/18/1/61}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trigger was the death in 1790 of a Quaker, [[Hannah Mills (Quaker)|Hannah Mills]], a few weeks after she had been admitted to the York Asylum&lt;ref name ="history"/&gt; (now known as [[Bootham Park Hospital]]). She was not allowed to have any visitation. The asylum had not let her friends or family visit her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://borthwickinstitute.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-york-lunatic-asylum-scandal.html |title=The York Lunatic Asylum Scandal |date=10 October 2014 |website=Borthwick Institute Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation brought several concerns about the condition of Hannah's death. Therefore, this led William Tuke to think about The Retreat as a place where people should be treated equally. However, visiting afterwards to investigate the conditions, the Quakers found that the patients were treated worse than animals.&lt;ref name="Samuel"&gt;Samuel, B. [http://www.quakerinfo.com/qt_retr.shtml Quaker Tour of England: The Retreat Mental Hospital] QuakerInfo.com Retrieved 8 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginnings===
Quaker [[William Tuke]] was enlisted and took charge of a project to develop a new form of asylum. His family enjoyed the tea and coffee merchant business.&lt;ref&gt;William Tuke. (2017). Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He appealed to Quakers, personal acquaintances and physicians for funds.&lt;ref name="Samuel"/&gt; He spent two years in discussion with, and issuing explanatory statements to the local Quaker group (York Monthly Meeting), working out the fundamental principles of the proposed institution. Tuke and his personal physician, Timothy Maud, educated themselves about the current views on "madness" and its treatment. Tuke's conviction, however, was in the importance of benevolence and a comfortable living environment encouraging reflection. Tuke also worked with architect [[John Bevans]] to design the new building.&lt;ref name="Edginton"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Edginton |first=B. |year=2003 |title=The design of moral architecture at the York Retreat |journal=Journal of Design History |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=103–117 |jstor=1316269 |doi=10.1093/jdh/16.2.103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Retreat opened in 1796 in the countryside outside York. It was planned to take in about 30 people but started with just three, then eight. Unlike mental institutions of the time, there were no chains or [[manacles]], and physical punishment was banned. Treatment was based on personalised attention and benevolence, restoring the self-esteem and self-control of residents. An early example of [[occupational therapy]] was introduced, including walks and farm labouring in pleasant and quiet surroundings. There was a social environment where residents were seen as part of a large family-like unit, built on kindness, moderation, order and trust. There was a religious dimension, including prayer. Inmates were accepted as potentially rational beings who could recover proper social conduct through self-restraint and moral strength. They were permitted to wear their own clothing, and encouraged to engage in handicrafts, to write, and to read books. They were allowed to wander freely around The Retreat's courtyards and gardens, which were stocked with various small domestic animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuke|first=Samuel [1813] |title=Description of the Retreat|publisher=Process Press|year =1996|location=London|isbn= 1-899209-04-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Design====

There was some minimal use of restraint. The design for the facility was to accommodate the patient by gender in separate bedrooms in a way specific to that patient treatment.&lt;ref name="Edginton" /&gt; Door locks were encased in leather, the bars on windows made to look like window frames, and the extensive gardens included a [[ha-ha|sunken wall]] that was impassable yet barely visible. [[Straitjackets]] were sometimes used, at least initially, as a threat or a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Laffey |first=P. |title=Psychiatric therapy in Georgian Britain |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=1285–97 |year=2003 |pmid=14580082 |doi=10.1017/S0033291703008109 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=179425}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was little formal medical involvement and an [[apothecary]], [[Thomas Fowler (apothecary)|Thomas Fowler]], served as physician. He gave the standard medical treatments "ample trial" but reluctantly and "courageously" abandoned them as failures. Fowler worked with [[George Jepson]], the first superintendent of The Retreat, and the two gradually concluded that the use of usual fear tactics actually made patients worse, and allaying patient's fears helped them. Jepson was said to have been authoritative yet patient, attentive, observant, kind, and open to new ideas in spite of his limited formal medical training. He arrived at the same time as a talented Quaker nurse [[Katherine Allen]], and the two married in 1806, thus heading The Retreat together.&lt;ref name="Charland2007"/&gt;

====The Moral Treatment====

The approach of The Retreat was widely derided at first. William Tuke noted that "All men seem to desert me."&lt;ref name="Samuel"/&gt; However, it became a model around the world for more humane and psychologically based approaches. The work was taken on by other Quakers, including Tuke's son [[Henry Tuke]] who co-founded The Retreat, and [[Samuel Tuke (reformer)|Samuel Tuke]] who helped popularise the approach which convince physicians to adopt it in his 1813, book ''Description of The Retreat near York''. His book explained in detail about the approach to use the moral treatment method for restoring the self-esteem, and self-control in individual with mental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Retreat, York, England|url=http://www.quakersintheworld.org/quakers-in-action/92/The-Retreat-York-England|publisher=Quakers in the World|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, Samuel Tuke popularised his use of the term [[moral treatment]] that he had borrowed from the French "traitement moral" being used to describe the work of [[Pussin]] and [[Philippe Pinel|Pinel]] in France (and in the original French referring to morale in the sense of the emotions and self-esteem, rather than rights and wrongs).&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt; The term came to refer to a number of moves towards more humane approaches that occurred toward the end of the 18th century in the context of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking, including also the work of [[Vincenzo Chiarugi]] in Italy. Ideas of "moral" management were incorporated, and used for various therapeutic and custodial purposes, in asylums and therapeutic communities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Growth and change===
Quaker as Friends Asylum in 1813, gained trust from the United States of America and had the opportunity to open the first private Friends Hospital which was a mental health facility on Philadelphia. During that time it was difficult to treat and impossible to cure mental health problems. In addition, Samuel's book with his explanation about the moral treatment gained trust from the community, and helped to raise money for the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quakersintheworld.org/quakers-in-action/136/Friends-Hospital-Philadelphia|title=Friends Hospital, Philadelphia|publisher=Quakers in the World|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1847 the first formal "medical" superintendent was appointed. Moral therapy was gradually replaced by medication, special diets and [[hydrotherapy]]. The size of the institution grew and the formerly close-knit community ethos was left behind. In addition, both Quaker influence and the number of Quaker patients decreased through the century. After the initial period for which it is best known, therefore, there were marked changes in management, therapy and client groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S003329170001970X |last=Digby |first=A. |title=The changing profile of a nineteenth-century asylum: the York Retreat |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=739–48 |date=November 1984 |pmid=6400132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1880 and 1884, most patients of The Retreat were under 50, single, and non-Quaker. A majority have been assessed today as having met criteria for a diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] or a [[mood disorder]]. The majority experienced delusions, with the most common being of persecution, grandeur and guilt, while about a third had religious content. Just under a third of patients were suicidal. Drug therapy was commonly prescribed. Just over a third of patients had a history of assault on other patients or asylum staff. About a tenth of patients were force-fed at some stage during their stay. About a half of patients were discharged within a year of admission, with the [[prognosis]] being better for patients with a mood disorder than for schizophrenia, but just under a third remained in the asylum for five or more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0033291700010990 |last=Renvoize |first=E. B. |last2=Beveridge |first2=A.

As key people in the history of The Retreat, the names of Katherine Allen and George Jepson have been given to two units at the hospital.&lt;ref name="services"/&gt;

==Services==
The Retreat is a registered charity operating as an independent hospital with 100 beds. It offers specialist services, including rehabilitation for [[psychosis]], [[dementia]], [[eating disorder]]s, and [[personality disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="services"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theretreatyork.org.uk/inpatient-mental-health-services/|title=Inpatient Mental Health Services|publisher=The Retreat website|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Retreat states that it provides mental healthcare that is unique to the person and values highly its original ethos.&lt;ref name="CoreValues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theretreatyork.org.uk/values.html|title=Core Values|publisher=The Retreat website|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although you do not have to have any connection to the Quakers to work at or receive healthcare from the Retreat, it remains a Quaker [[Christian ministry|ministry]]&lt;ref name="Samuel"/&gt; and has a Quaker Chaplain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theretreatyork.org.uk/spirituality.html|title=Spirituality|publisher=The Retreat|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yorkshire General Meeting of Friends suggests names for half of the Board of Trustee Directors.&lt;ref name="directors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theretreatyork.org.uk/board-of-directors.html|title=Board of Trustee Directors|publisher=The Retreat website|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burial ground of the York [[Friends Meeting House]] is in the grounds of the hospital.&lt;ref name="Samuel"/&gt;

==Notable figures==

The '''Uranium Medical Research Centre''' (UMRC) is an independent non-profit organization founded in 1997 to provide objective and expert scientific and medical research into the effects of [[uranium]], [[transuranium element]]s, and [[radionuclide]]s produced by the process of [[radioactive decay]] and [[Nuclear fission|fission]]. UMRC is also a registered charity in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The founder of UMRC, [[Asaf Durakovic]], claimed on CNN &lt;ref&gt;CNN, broadcast 05/02/2007, ''American Morning special investigation by Greg Hunter: depleted uranium hidden health risks''&lt;/ref&gt; that: "Inhalation of uranium dust is harmful.... Even in the amount of one atom".

== Vision ==

UMRC states at its website that its vision for the world, "is a full awareness of the risks of using nuclear products and by-products AND to contain the still reversible alterations of the earth's biosphere since the advent of nuclear events and the resulting contamination". 
They go on to state further that: "There needs to be an appreciation of the enormous effects and damage of uranium on the environment and human health. Governments, scientific communities, and the general public need to understand the many forms of contamination and specific effects. Continued abuses of uranium and [[radioisotope]]s will only lead to the steady degradation and eventual end of meaningful life on earth." www.UMRC.net

A '''watering trough''' (or '''artificial watering point''') is a man-made or natural receptacle intended to provide drinking water to animals, [[livestock]] on farms or ranches or wild animals.

In [[Australia]], the watering trough is established so that sheep, cattle and other domesticated animals can drink, but native species such as [[kangaroo]]s may be attracted. To reduce this, some water troughs are designed to reduce their use of the trough or exclude them from that use.&lt;ref name="CSIRO"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Electrified watering trough that excludes Kangaroos |pages=3–8 |author=GL Norbury |journal=The Rangeland Journal |year=1992 |volume=14 |issue=1 |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/RJ9920003.htm |doi=10.1071/RJ9920003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watering troughs were very common in many towns and cities as a means for [[horse]]s to drink while they were tethered to a post. In 1927 animal lovers, Annis and George Bills, funded the building of up to 500 watering troughs in Australia, Ireland, England and the United States.  Many can still be seen today inscribed with ''Donated by Annis and George Bills Australia''.&lt;ref name="bills"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~geogem|title=Annis and George Bills |accessdate=2008-10-11 |author=George Gemmill |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States '''women represent roughly a quarter of all arrests'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/ucr-publications|title=UCR Publications|website=FBI|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women and men are both more likely to be arrested for less serious property crimes, but men are more likely than women to be involved in violent crime.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Female Offenders: Critical Perspectives and Effective Interventions|last=Schwartz|first=Jennifer|last2=Steffensmeier|first2=Darrell|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|year=2008|isbn=|editor-last=Zaplin|editor-first=Ruth|location=Sudbury, MA|pages=43–75|chapter=Nature of Female Offending: Patterns and Explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1960, while arrests in total have decreased, women have become a higher percentage of those arrests, partly due to an increase in drug-related arrests. [[Darrell Steffensmeier|Steffensmeier]] and Schwartz (2008) claim that this increase is not because more women are committing substance-abuse offenses, it is because law enforcement officials have begun using broader, more expansive definitions of crimes, arresting more people for minor crimes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because women are more likely to commit these minor crimes, females have been disproportionately added to the number of arrests.

== Women and the War on Drugs ==
{{See also|History of United States drug prohibition}}
In the late 1960s recreational drug use among middle-class increased as it became more socially mainstream. It was associated with countercultural movements and social and political unrest.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/cron/|title=Thirty Years Of America's Drug War {{!}} Drug Wars {{!}} FRONTLINE {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act, which regulated and penalized drug use according to five different “schedules”. Each recreational drug was assigned a schedule based on its potential for addiction and abuse, its acceptable medical uses, and its safety profile. Each schedule carried different levels of penalties for use, possession, or distribution of a drug – Schedule I had the harshest penalties, while Schedule V had the most lenient ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/812.htm|title=Title 21 United States Code (USC) Controlled Substances Act - Section 812|website=www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The War on Drugs and public anti-drug sentiment reached a peak when [[Ronald Reagan]] became president in 1981 and First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] started her “Just Say No” anti-drug campaign targeted at middle-class children and adolescents. Simultaneously, the advent of crack cocaine in New York City severely impacted inner-city areas and increased the public's political opposition to drug use.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Reagan also signed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act in 1986, which imposed mandatory minimum sentences, removing discretion from judges when sentencing drug offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/5484|title=H.R.5484 - Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986|last=|first=|date=September 8, 1986|website=Congress.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=May 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dana Britton in 2011&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gender of Crime|last=Britton|first=Dana|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|year=2011|isbn=|location=Lanham, MD|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Steffensmeier and Schwartz in 2008&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; conclude War on Drugs has created a disproportionally large impact on women, especially on women of color, because of an increase in the severity and frequency of minor crime- and drug-related arrests and the fact that women are more likely than men are to commit non-serious crimes.

Bloom, Owen and Covington (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bloom|first=Barbara|last2=Owen|first2=Barbara|last3=Covington|first3=Stephanie|date=2004-01-01|title=Women Offenders and the Gendered Effects of Public Policy1|journal=Review of Policy Research|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=31–48|doi=10.1111/j.1541-1338.2004.00056.x|issn=1541-1338}}&lt;/ref&gt; additionally state that the majority of women offenders are poor, undereducated, and underemployed, hurting their chances of desisting properly and increasing their risk of recidivism after leaving prison. Around 60% of women in state and federal prisons are mothers of minor children; the effect of the War on Drugs has been not only to disproportionately impact the women themselves, but also to impact their children, the next generation. In addition, as Britton&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Beckett, Nyrop, and Pfingst&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckett|first=Katherine|last2=Nyrop|first2=Kris|last3=Pfingst|first3=Lori|date=2006-02-01|title=Race, Drugs, and Policing: Understanding Disparities in Drug Delivery Arrests*|journal=Criminology|language=en|volume=44|issue=1|pages=105–137|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.2006.00044.x|issn=1745-9125}}&lt;/ref&gt; point out, Hispanic and African-American women are overrepresented in the population of women involved in the criminal justice system.

The advent of crack cocaine, a cheaper version of cocaine that could be smoked, in American inner-city neighborhoods in the 1980s coincided with rampant deindustrialization, increasing unemployment rates, and an increasing number of female heads-of-households. The advent of crack also came at the same time as the peak of the War on Drugs and its increasingly more punitive laws and focus on defunding welfare programs.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryder|first=Judith A.|last2=Brisgone|first2=Regina E.|date=2013-01-01|title=Cracked Perspectives Reflections of Women and Girls in the Aftermath of the Crack Cocaine Era|url=http://fcx.sagepub.com/content/8/1/40|journal=Feminist Criminology|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=40–62|doi=10.1177/1557085112444899|issn=1557-0851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, as well as the cheaper price of crack, women's drug use rates went up. Ryder and Brisgone interview a group of mothers who grew up during this “Crack Era” in the 1990s to find out how they and their children were affected by the War on Drugs and crack.

They find that the mothers’ heavy use of drugs during this era heavily influenced their children to try drugs. Additionally, many women were pressured or chose to perform sex work in order to support their “urgent need for drugs”. The authors of this study found that the mothers’ addiction further forced them to spend less time with their families, disrupting ties between mother and child, although they did love their children and wanted to spend time with them when they could.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Women's participation in the drug economy ==

=== Women and the informal economy ===
The informal economy is a sector of the economy that includes “all criminal activity that is income generating”.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Losby|first=Jan L.|last2=Else|first2=John F.|last3=Kingslow|first3=Marcia E.|last4=Edgcomb|first4=Elaine L.|last5=Malm|first5=Erika T.|last6=Kao|first6=Vivian|date=December 2002|title=Informal Economy Literature Review|url=|journal=The Aspen Institute|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, this means that the selling and consumption of drugs is part of the informal economy. Throughout the world, working women are more likely to work in the informal sector, partly because their traditional household and childcare responsibilities may make it preferable to work form home. Others believe that women are “forced” into the informal sector because the formal sector fails to accommodate gender-specific needs for women, such as paid maternity leave.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Since the 1980s, cheaper imports have been competing for domestically manufactured goods in the United States, leading to deindustrialization, particularly in urban areas. This has caused unemployment in the formal sector. Furthermore, a decrease in welfare policies has also encouraged unemployment. Both of these factors have led to a growth in the informal sector of the U.S. economy, raising the number of women who work in this sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Cyril|date=1988-01-01|title=Introduction: Exploring the Informal Economy|jstor=29766419|journal=Social Justice|volume=15|issue=3/4 (33–34)|pages=3–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused an influx of women into drug markets.

=== The drug economy as an equalizer ===
The presence of women in drug markets has prompted sociologists, criminologists, and anthropologists to discuss the role of women in these markets. Do they hold positions in the drug economy that are liberated from mainstream society's gender inequality, or does society's sexism reproduce itself in the drug economy?

Anthropologist Phillippe Bourgois, in an ethnography of the crack market in Spanish Harlem, states that the presence of women on the streets and in the crack market illustrates their emancipation from household labor and childcare. They are free to participate in street life.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Philippe|first=Bourgois|date=August 1989|title=Crack in Spanish Harlem: Culture and Economy in the Inner City|url=|journal=Anthropology Today|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Natasha Du Rose, Wilson (1993) makes the argument that women's crime and drug use are rising to match men's because of women's emancipation.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbK6CQAAQBAJ|title=The Governance of Female Drug Users: Women's Experiences of Drug Policy|last=Rose|first=Natasha Du|date=2015-05-27|publisher=Policy Press|isbn=9781847426727|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Du Rose quotes Fagan as saying that women's positions in the drug economy are high-status enough that prostitution plays a “relatively insignificant” part in generating income for these women.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== The drug economy perpetuating inequalities ===
While Bourgois in 1989 states that women are free to take part in the drug trade now that they have been liberated from being wives and mothers, he qualifies this by saying that “traditional gender relations still govern income-generating strategies in the underground economy”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; His ethnographic research shows that the majority of women in the Spanish Harlem crack market become sex workers to support their addictions. While women participate more in the drug economy, they still are forced into traditional street roles when they need to generate income.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Sociologists Lisa Maher and Kathleen Daly in 1996 performed an ethnographic study of women in the Bushwick drug market in Brooklyn. They used a combination of participant observation fieldwork and interviews with the women and found that, in a highly hierarchical drug market, women occupy the lowest rungs of the market. “Owners”, who all happen to be men, employ “managers” who control a number of regular and casual “sellers”. These sellers in turn employ “runners”, “steerers”, and “coppers”, who supply the sellers, advertise their brand of drugs, or buy drugs for other customers. The runners, steerers, coppers, and casual sellers occupy the lowest-power and lowest-income positions of this market, and have the most women participants. The upper levels of the hierarchy have only men participants. In this study, Maher and Daly refute the idea that the emergence of the crack economy has afforded emancipation and opportunity for women; gender inequality has continued to be a presence even in the informal economy. The only change Maher and Daly found brought by women's liberation appears to be a decrease in the number of women relying on male boyfriends or husbands to sell drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maher|first=Lisa|last2=Daly|first2=Kathleen|date=November 1996|title=Women in the Street-Level Drug Economy: Continuity or Change?|url=|journal=Criminology|volume=34|issue=4|pages=465–492|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1996.tb01216.x|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisa Maher continues her research on the Bushwick drug economy in her 1997 book ''Sexed Work''. She reiterates her findings with Daly on the low-income, low-power participation of women in the drug market, but she also focuses on the sex work women more commonly perform to generate income. Since the influx of cheap crack into the market, Maher finds out that more women have been induced to participate in street-level prostitution, driving up competition and driving down prices, further disadvantaging the women, especially low-income women of color who typically do not attract high-paying clients anyway. Furthermore, while the influx of crack lowered prices significantly, Maher's book does not support the idea that women frequently exchange sex directly for drugs.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexed Work|last=Maher|first=Lisa|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women's strategies for coping with inequalities ===
Although women can be disadvantaged in the drug economy, they find ways to cope with these inequalities. In ''Sexed Work'', Lisa Maher states that some women adopt a “badass” or a “crazy” persona in order to survive amongst violent male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Maher and Susan L. Hudson, in a literature review of the women in the drug economy, explain that women are able to use their image as “feminine”, “vulnerable”, or "innocent" to hide from police suspicions and sell drugs successfully. They also may be able to use their “feminine” social and communication skills to defuse potentially violent situations. Maher and Hudson also find that many women can cope with limited opportunities for generating income in the drug economy by “diversifying”: they make money through a flexible mix of sex work, welfare, formal sector jobs, and drug selling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maher|first=Lisa|last2=Hudson|first2=Susan L.|date=2007|title=Women in the Drug Economy: A Metasynthesis of Qualitative Literature|url=|journal=Journal of Drug Issues|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
